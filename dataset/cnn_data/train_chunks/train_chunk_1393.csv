"A vigilante cyclist dubbed 'the most hated man on two wheels' after using cameras to convict 70 motorists has even got a fellow bus driver sacked, it has emerged. Dave Sherry, 37, has become notorious for filming drivers breaking road laws on his way to work with three cameras on his helmet and bike and then handing footage over to police. But he has also turned in four clips of bus drivers using handheld devices behind the wheel during his two-and-a-half year crusade for road safety and said he would happily do it again. Scroll down for video . Vigilante cyclist Dave Sherry, 37, has even got a fellow bus driver sacked  after he was caught using a hand-held device (pictured) Mr Sherry uses three cameras mounted on his bike in his campaign against bad driving . The father-of-five from Harlow, Essex, saw one driver with his eyes off the road and as he passed his cabin, he darted his head to the right to capture the incriminating footage. 'The only people who are unhappy with me are the ones that drive like complete idiots. If you do no wrong then you have nothing to fear,' he said. 'If you are a good driver then you are not going to be on the YouTube for driving like a professional. 'Some aren't going to be happy with what I do but I don't care - life goes on. It's all in the name of safety. At the end of the day we are called professional drivers for a reason. 'If you want to do something wrong then you have got to face the consequences. The father-of-five from Harlow, Essex, has turned in four clips of bus drivers using handheld devices, in this picture he is seen confronting one of the drivers . The vigilante cyclist is seen speaking to one of the drivers after filming him breaking the rules of the road . 'If that means the job centre and a P45 then fine. If you break the rules then I will make sure you will be sorry - I will gladly do it again.' Bus operators Roadrunner Coaches claimed that the driver had been viewing a handheld ticket machine - but sacked him anyway. A spokesman said: 'The driver has since been dismissed because he shouldn't have been looking at something when he was driving.' Essex Police investigated the incident in September 2013 but are yet to confirm the outcome. The vigilante cyclist has handed three other clips of bus drivers on phones to the police in the hope they are prosecuted and fired. He has also shamed dodgy cyclists by posting videos of them running red lights to his YouTube account. During his 40-mile round-trip  from his home in Harlow, Essex, to a depot in east London, Mr Sherry lets motorists know his views on their driving and has even given a police officer a ticking off. He takes his evidence to police and councils and says the footage has been used to secure 70 convictions for driving offences including speeding, overtaking too close and running red lights. The father-of-five says he has secured two convictions for assault on him by angry drivers and is having a taxi driver investigated over claims he went the wrong way round a roundabout. A number of the videos show cyclist Mr Sherry being attacked by drivers angered by his actions . As well as helping police investigate driving offences - he says two drivers have been prosecuted for assault . Mr Sherry says he is now so notorious that he often has to fend off attacks from irate drivers, including several who have thrown punches. He even goes equipped with a horn as loud as a jet plane to alert dangerous drivers of his presence. 'I do what I do because I want to make our roads safer for everyone. If people follow the Highway Code there would be so many fewer accidents and casualties,' he said. Mr Sherry started filming drivers cycling from Harlow to his east London bus depot two-and-a-half years ago after he was involved in an accident. He said: 'Someone hit the back of my bike and the police said they couldn't do anything because it's my word against them. 'That spurred me on, so I went and got my cameras.'

Mr Sherry says he is now so notorious that he often has to fend off attacks from irate drivers, including several who have thrown punches. Films he has shot using the cameras are posted on YouTube and show drivers remonstrating with him . Mr Sherry claims to have helped secure 70 convictions using the three cameras on his bike and helmet . The London bus driver said he is now 'Britain's most hated cyclist'. He said: 'I do what I do because I want to make our roads safer for everyone. If people follow the Highway Code there would be so many fewer accidents and casualties.' Mr Sherry started filming drivers cycling from Harlow to his east London bus depot two-and-a-half years ago after he was involved in an accident. He said: 'Someone hit the back of my bike and the police said they couldn't do anything because it's my word against them. The bus driver insists he posts the videos to highlight bad driving and to keep the roads safe for cyclists . Mr Sherry is unapologetic to those caught by his cameras and says: 'It's like a war zone out there' 'That spurred me on, so I went and got my cameras.' Mr Sherry straps £1,000 worth of cameras to his bike for his daily rides and even resorted to wearing body armour for protection against motorists. To stay safe he dresses head to toe in fluorescent clothing and took to wearing £80 body armour after he was assaulted in the line of his self-appointed duty. He was punched in the stomach by a furious van driver, who police confirmed received a caution for ABH, in June 2013. He said: 'He just saw red and went for the attack. He properly knocked me back with a punch and I smashed the back of my head on rocks behind me. As well as a camera mounted on his helmet, he also had one of the front and one of the rear of his bike . Mr Sherry is not the only cyclist to attempt to shame drivers with videos shot from helmet and handlebar cams. Lewis Dediare - also known as 'Traffic Droid' - has a camera mounted on a three-foot pole protruding from his modified bicycle. The 39-year-old also carries a ruler to measure  his distance from cars and brandishes  a 'red card' at offending road users. Like Mr Cherry, he also uploads his footage to YouTube and Twitter and will often hand it over to police so the drivers can be further punished. Lewis Dediare - aka 'Traffic Droid' - also posts footage from his helmet and handlebar cams online . Mr Dediare's antics were filmed for Channel 4 documentary The Complainers last year. He says his naming and shaming video clips have resulted in around 200 police warnings every year, as well as several prosecutions. The telecoms officer set out to take action against poor driving in 2009 when he was hit by a car which failed to indicate as drove into his lane while out cycling. He broke two ribs and also injured his back and hip, but when he learned the driver had only been given a driving education course he felt more needed to be done to warn motorists of the dangers they pose to cyclists.","Cyclist Dave Sherry, 37, was dubbed 'the most hated man on two wheels'

"A New Mexico police officer stumbled upon $33,000 in stolen artwork while he was searching an abandoned crystal meth lab. The Albuquerque officer found the valuable prints by late American Indian artist Al Momaday last week during a  sweep of a condemned apartment before city officials boarded up the property. The apartment was deemed uninhabitable following the discovery of the drug lab. Scroll down for video . Artwork by Al Momaday (pictured) found in a meth lab in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was valued at $33,000 . Momaday's paintings depict his Native American heritage and are featured in galleries around the US . The prints are in good condition and they are being kept in the same black case they were found in . After finding the prints in a portfolio on the floor, the officer put Momaday's name into Google and figured out he was an Oklahoma-born Kiowa painter who died in 1981. Momaday's paintings depict his Native American heritage and are featured in galleries around the US. The officer wrote in his report: 'Knowing this, and knowing all the history about this apartment, I knew (whoever) left this property behind had no lawful reason to be in possession of this (artwork).' The apartment where the art was found was deemed uninhabitable following the discovery of the drug lab . AMC's Breaking Bad (pictured), a television series centered around characters producing and selling crystal meth, was set and produced in Albuquerque . It's possible the artwork was stolen from Momaday’s son, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist N. Scott Momaday . The prints were brought to Albuquerque Museum of Art and History curator Andrew Connors so he could evaluate them, the Albuquerque Journal reported. He said: 'Generally we don't get involved in investigations of stolen art, but in this case it's kind of an odd set of prints. 'They may have been stolen out of a warehouse or a back storage building behind a gallery or an artist's estate. 'We have no idea where they could have come from. 'Wherever it was, they haven't noticed they're gone yet.' Momaday’s son, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist N. Scott Momaday, indicated it was possible some of his father’s art went missing when he was moving things out of storage to a house in Santa Fe. In an email to Daily Mail Online, curator Connors confirmed the prints 'probably' belong to the writer. He wrote: 'I spoke with his daughter this morning who confirmed that they had probably been taken from their storage unit in Santa Fe.' The prints are in great shape and they are being kept in the same black case they were found in, KOB 4 reported. No arrests have been made and the case remains under investigation. Born in Mountain View, Oklahoma, Alfred Momaday was a painter of works depicting his Indian heritage and was also a renowned teacher. His work included alter plaques for churches in Albuquerque. Momaday, whose Indian name was Haun Toa, meaning War Lance, was the son of Kiowa Indian parents. In 1933 he married Natachee Scott at Jemez Pueblo in New Mexico, where he initiated a program that brought international reputation to the school. He was educated at Bacone College, the University of New Mexico, and University of California in Los Angeles. From 1942 to 1944, he was in the Ward Department of the US Corps of Engineers. In 1975 he created a medal for his son, N. Scott Momaday, who was the first American Indian to win a Pulitzer Prize for literature.

"A prankster who took Ellen DeGeneres up on a 'dance dare' has launched a $5 million lawsuit against the NYPD after claiming he was thrown to the ground after performing behind them. Alexandre Nzebele alleges he was roughed up by six police officers after he filmed himself dancing Gangnam-style behind them as they stood behind a vehicle outside Grand Central. Mr Nzebele, 22, filed a claim against the city and NYPD in the Manhattan federal court yesterday. Prankster Alexandre Nzebele has launched a $5 million lawsuit against the city and the NYPD claiming the officers threw him to the ground while he was performing a dare for a segment of Ellen DeGeneres' TV show . After noticing Mr Nzebele dancing behind them, the officers turned around and held him against their vehicle . He was shooting a video of himself for Ellen's 'Dance Dare' segment of her daytime television show; Ellen is pictured above during an episode of her show with actress Nicole Kidman . He says he was shooting a video of himself for Ellen's 'Dance Dare' segment on her daytime show that urges 'people to film themselves dancing behind strangers without them being aware of it', when the incident happened. A video of the 22-year-old dancing behind people and eventually allegedly being pushed to the ground by officers has since gone viral. Mr Nzebele can be heard saying 'I'm sorry' during the altercation. Mr Nzebele claims the officers said: 'What the f— is wrong with you?', 'are you f—ing kidding me?', 'what are you dancing in the street for?'. The incident came at a time when police were on edge. It occurred just four days after two uniformed officers in Brooklyn were shot dead in their car and following the Staten Island grand jury's decision not to indict an officer for the chokehold that contributed to Eric Garner's death. Mr Nzebele's lawyer Robert Tolchin told the New York Post that he understands some 'police officers were on edge … but that does not give them a right to manhandle the public or violate people's rights.' Video of the 22-year-old dancing behind people and eventually allegedly being pushed to the ground by officers has since gone viral; Mr Nzebele can be heard saying 'I'm sorry' during the altercation . Mr Nzebele claims he was abused by the officers before they shoved him to the ground, as seen above . Earlier in the video the prankster can be seen sneaking up behind people before dancing Gangnam style . The pranksters victims are generally completely unaware he is dancing behind them, and as they become suspicious he stops he stops; Mr Nzebele's lawyer says his client was was intimidated, insulted and thrown to the ground 'without any legal cause whatsoever' Mr Tolchin went on to tell the newspaper that those incidents did not give officers the right to 'resort to street justice'. He claims his client was intimidated, insulted and thrown to the ground 'without any legal cause whatsoever'. Mr Tolchin added: 'Dancing is not a crime. 'People have the right to stand in the street and express themselves.' Mr Nzebele, who also goes by the name 'Alexander BOK' online - says the officer involved in the incident never asked him to stop dancing, or to do so elsewhere. The city Law Department has reportedly said it would 'review the lawsuit once it is served.'","Alexandre Nzebele took up an Ellen DeGeneres public 'dance dare'

"Stevie Nicks was 27 when she became the ‘Queen Bee’ of the British-American rock band, Fleetwood Mac. Up until that time, writing songs and singing with her longtime sweetheart, Lindsay Buckingham, she hadn’t indulged in drugs. But that was all about to change. She quickly descended into drug hell and became addicted to cocaine, alcohol, Quaaludes to sleep, and cigarettes – until her system broke down and she started having nosebleeds, falls on stage, blackouts and near overdoses. She bought $1 million worth of cocaine and it burned a hole in her nose the size of a dime. Rumors spread that she had to have the drug blown up her derriere by an assistant. ‘There was no way to get off the white horse and I didn’t want to,' the now 66-year-old Nicks said. Scroll down for video . Besotted: Stevie Nicks has a two-year, off-and-on affair with married drummer Mick Fleetwood. Their passion was fueled by drugs and alcohol. Mick was still married to model Jenny Boyd at the time . Hot: Stevie and Nick made beautiful music together - both on and off the stage . She only slowed down her drug consumption when her doctor warned her she was risking permanent mental and physical damage as well as heading for a brain hemorrhage or an early grave. The group called for an intervention and saved her life by urging her to check in to the Betty Ford Center. Stevie got cleaned up from one drug and went into therapy, but for the next nine years she became dependent on another drug prescribed for anxiety that plunged her into years of depression and weight gain. ‘But I got through it, I was so lucky’, Zoe Howe quotes Nicks in her new book, Stevie Nicks: Visions, Dreams & Rumours, published by Omnibus Press, 5 February. Nicks fell madly in love with Mick Fleetwood two years after she joined Fleetwood Mac, while she was dating the Eagles' Don Henley in 1977. She called Mick one of her ‘great great loves’. Fleetwood, in his own biography, writes they secretly began seeing each other in Los Angeles while on a break from a tour, the clandestine nature of the meetings accelerating their passion. ‘I was in love with her, and she loved me, and it was not something passing in the night’. ‘It was a proper Hollywood affair on a par with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor’. But the complications with significant others and band-mates made it feel like ‘utter madness’. Mick was still married to model Jenny Boyd at the time. True love: Stevie still carries a torch for Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh. ‘There was nothing more important than Joe Walsh, not my music, not my songs, not anything,' she said. She wanted to marry Joe . But the greatest love in Nicks' life was keyboard player and guitarist Joe Walsh of the Eagles. She still carries a torch for the musician. But Walsh believed one of them would die from a drug overdose if they stayed together so he walked out the door. ‘There was no other man in the world for me. And it’s the same today’, Nicks confessed. Fleetwood Mac was ‘a fairytale on acid’ to Stevie Nicks, and Mick Fleetwood was like ‘an English king’ to her when they first met in Los Angeles. ‘I was awestruck. I still am to this day of Mick’s presence’. Endless days recording in the studio with Fleetwood, cocaine now became a daily indulgence for Nicks – as well as Courvoisier, Heineken beer, honey and hot tea and marijuana. She consumed so many drugs that weeks went by without sleep. Nicks wore a little gold and turquoise bottle inlaid with diamonds of coke around her neck so she would never be without the drug. While the guys did rails of coke, the girls daintily inhaled tiny spoonfuls of the drug. Crystal balls, knick knacks, dolls, gypsy chic chiffon dresses, shawls trinkets, feathers, lace, twirling on stage – and mountains of drugs defined her rock ‘n’ roll lifestyle. They were the world’s most hedonistic band, the author writes. To avoid body searches by customs in Europe, they hired a private train to travel through Germany, and into France and Holland. The luxurious lounge car with its gold light fittings and velvet drapes had once belong to Hitler – including the elderly attendant who had once served the Fuhrer and was still on board. Nicks had an affair with Eagles' Don Henley (at right in 1973 and with Stevie years later), founding member of the group, drummer and singer. She was romanced by the Maseratis, the mansions, the destroyed hotels, the parties that defined the Eagles lifestyle . Musician Lindsey Buckingham was Stevie's first love. They both joined Fleetwood Mac together in 1975 . Every whim of the band members was met. While on tour, all Nicks wanted was the presidential suite at hotels. ‘We were elegant people and we wanted a place to sleep after the show that was beautiful’. Before falling into the arms of Mick and Joe Walsh, Nicks had an affair with Eagle Don Henley, founding member of the group, drummer and singer. She was romanced by the Maseratis, the mansions, the destroyed hotels, the parties that defined the Eagles lifestyle. She became pregnant with his child and chose to have an abortion. The affair was quickly over but she wrote a song, ‘Sara,’ for their unborn girl. With Eagle Joe Walsh, ‘it was love’. ‘We were busy being superstars, and everyone was doing way too many drugs. But I was so in love with him’, Nicks is quoted.as saying. Of all the men she had been involved with, Joe was the one man she wanted to marry. ‘There was nothing more important than Joe Walsh, not my music, not my songs, not anything’. ‘I remember days of misery waiting by the phone. Me in my house, with him saying ‘I’m going to visit you’. I would kick everyone out because I just wanted to be with him, and not a phone call. [I put up with it because] I was in love with him’. With all the drugs, ‘we were a couple on the way to hell’. ‘It took me a long, long time to get over it’. In her heyday Stevie was considered the Queen of Rock 'n' Roll. But even after Fleetwood Mac disbanded Stevie was a quadruple platinum solo artist . She was caught up in depression for nine years that resulted from long-term use of the tranquilizer, Klonopin prescribed for her anxiety while recovering from cocaine dependency. She supplemented the Klonopin with barbiturates. After having her breast implants removed in December 1976, she was diagnosed with Epstein-Barr, a viral infection that causes crippling fatigue. She underwent plastic surgery to change the proportion of her body after soaring up to 175 pounds on the drug. The drugs were killing her and she admitted herself to the Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Venice Beach. This detox was harder than kicking her cocaine addiction. Her last tour with Fleetwood Mac with in December 1990 until the group decided those were the best years of their lives. They mended old ills and jumped back out on tour late in 2014. In those intervening years, Nicks, put out quadruple platinum solo albums. ‘I believe there have been angels with me constantly through these last twenty years, or I wouldn't be alive’. Her one big regret however was not the drugs, not the affairs, but not stopping to have a baby.

"Bobby Brown's sister allegedly smacked her son in the head with a bottle during a hotel fight after the family gathered in Atlanta to be at his daughter Bobbi Kristina's hospital bedside. Tina Brown hit Shayne Brown in the head with a bottle at the bar of the W. Midtown Atlanta Hotel early on Friday, according to an Atlanta Police report. Shayne Brown then drove himself to a nearby hospital, where he was treated for lacerations to the side of the head, while Tina Brown took off before police arrived, according to the report. The police report noted that the family had been at a birthday party for Bobby Brown - who turned 46 on Thursday - when the mother and son started arguing over a valet parking ticket. Scroll down for video . Calm before the storm: Shayne Brown (second left) and his mother Tina Brown (second right) smile with his wife and father on Thursday - before a fight erupted and Tina allegedly hit him with a bottle . Scene: The scrap unfolded at the W. Midtown Atlanta Hotel, pictured, early on Friday . 'Mr Brown stated that while arguing with his mother, she spit in his face and hit him on his head with a glass bottle,' the report noted. According to TMZ, she took a swing at him when Shayne called his mother a 'crackhead'. He told police he did not want to press charges against his mother. The fight erupted after Bobby Brown celebrated his birthday on Thursday at Ocean Prime restaurant in Atlanta with as many as 20 friends and family,E! Online reported. Brown, who looked tired as he arrived, was escorted to a private dining area that was sectioned off by a curtain. He was joined by his pregnant wife Alicia Etheredge and their son Cassius, five. Despite the tragedy that has befallen the family this week, there was a party atmosphere, E! reported. Brown was lavished with presents, two birthday cakes and a rendition of 'Happy Birthday'. The restaurant, which is in the upscale neighborhood of Buckhead, serves celebratory dishes including $49 twin lobster tails, Chilean sea bass with a truffle sauce for $43 and steaks for $48. Members of the Brown family have been gathering in Atlanta after Bobbi Kristina was found unresponsive in a bathtub at her Roswell home last weekend - in a tragedy that eerily shadows the death of her mother, Whitney Houston, in 2012. The 21-year-old, who was reportedly found by her partner Nick Gordon and a friend, is currently in a medically-induced coma at Emory University Hospital. Although the family has remained tight-lipped about her condition, on Thursday, one of her cousins revealed that doctors do not believe she will improve. 'The odds are against her': Bobbi Kristina's cousin Jerod Brown wrote on his Instagram page on Thursday that 'doctors don't see any hope for change' in her condition as he called for prayers . Concerned: Bobby Brown checks his phone as he has a drink on Thursday, his 46th birthday . Party: The fight erupted after as many as 20 family members, including children, gathered at this restaurant in the upscale neighborhood of Buckhead to celebrate his birthday on Thursday night . Brawl: Bobby Brown's sister Tina Brown, pictured left, allegedly spat on then hit her son Shayne, right . 'Though it seems the odds are against her,' Jerod Brown wrote, 'though doctors don't see any hope for change, though we might want to play detective and find out how she got there, though it looks impossible for her to stand again STILL PRAY FOR BK.' His message is one of the first family insights into Bobbi's condition since she was found face-down in a bathtub on Saturday and put in a medically-induced coma. She is now at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. On Thursday, DailyMail.com learned that Bobbi's life-support machine was switched off. 'The plug on Bobbi Kristina has been pulled,' a police source said. It is possible for a patient to survive despite artificial assistance being withdrawn. On Friday, TMZ reported that was refusing to take his daughter off life support - despite doctor's advice - because he believes in 'God-driven miracles'. Bobby Brown did not respond directly to the life support claims but slammed reports saying that the family were preparing to say goodbye to his youngest daughter. 'This is false, just as is the vast majority of the other reporting that is currently taking place,' he said in a statement on Thursday. 'If we issued a statement every time the media published a false report regarding this matter, that's all we would be doing 24 hours a day.' The last official word on Bobbi's condition from the family came on Tuesday when they said in a statement that she was 'fighting for her life and is surrounded by immediate family'. Denial: Bobby Brown, pictured leaving Emory University Hospital on Thursday, has denied reports that the family is preparing for the worst. On Thursday, a police source said her life support had been removed . Support network: Bobby Brown, right, and his wife Alicia Etheredge, left, leave the hospital on Thursday . On Thursday, he briefly told Access Hollywood that his daughter was 'good'. He appeared tired and his eyes were red as if he had been crying, the program reported. 'We're praying,' he added. Bobbi's 'devastated' grandmother, gospel singer Cissy Houston, mother of Whitney, was also seen arriving at the hospital, according to Radar Online, having flown in from her New Jersey home. 'Cissy was so traumatized losing Whitney and the pain is still raw from that,' a source told the website. 'Watching Krissy in the hospital and in the coma is almost more than she can handle. This is almost too much sadness for her to bear.' Meanwhile, Houston's mentor Clive Davis says he's been in touch the family and is praying for Bobbi. Davis said he's offered his support and and 'they're so grateful.' 'Of course it's heartbreaking to see the family go through this pain once again,' Davis said at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, where Houston died in 2012 and where he will hold a pre-Grammy gala Saturday. 'They just ask that the public respect their privacy.' Tragic: Bobbi Kristina, pictured with her partner Nick Gordon, was found unconscious on Saturday morning . Vigil: Gordon was pictured outside the North Fulton Hospital, where Bobbi Kristina was first taken, on Sunday . Houston died in a bathtub from an 'accidental' drug overdose almost exactly three years ago, in tragically similar circumstances. Authorities found a dozen prescription drug bottles in her Beverly Hills Hotel suite and listed heart disease and cocaine use as contributors, but concluded that she accidentally drowned. Bobbi Kristina was found in eerily similar circumstances on Saturday morning. Questions still remain over what part drugs - if any - played in Saturday's incident; police reportedly found narcotics in the home during a second search last weekend. Police said she was found by her purported husband, Nick Gordon, and a friend, Max Lomas. Lomas' lawyer has since said he was the one who found Bobbi Kristina and started CPR. On Friday, the attorney for the friend who found Bobbi Kristina said he went looking for her when a cable guy turned up at the door. When she didn't respond to his knocks, he went inside the bathroom. 'It seems like it might've been 10 or 15 minutes that she must have been alone,' Max's attorney, Ashleigh Merchant, told E! News. 'But we don't know at what point she actually ended up in the tub during that time.' Bobby Brown spoke out earlier this week to correct reports that his daughter had married Gordon. Bobbi Kristina and Gordon were brought up like brother and sister after Houston took Gordon as a child. But following her death, the duo announced they were in a relationship. Missed: Bobbi's mother Whitney Houston, pictured together in 2007, died in a bathtub from an 'accidental' drug overdose almost exactly three years ago, in tragically similar circumstances . Then last January the couple announced that they had got married, and Bobbi Kristina posted photos of their 'wedding rings' on social media. But on Tuesday a lawyer representing Bobbi's father released the following statement: 'We are currently investigating the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina.' 'To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon,' added Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen LLC. Relations between Gordon and  other family members have been rocky and he remains subject to a protective order barring him from being within 200 feet of Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Patricia Houston.","Tina Brown and her son Shayne Brown got into a fight about a parking valet ticket after Bobby Brown's birthday party on Thursday .

"The pilot of the doomed TransAsia was still holding the joystick in the plane's cockpit when his body was found, it has been reported. Liao Chien-tsung, 42, has been hailed as a hero for his actions in the desperate last moments before the crash that killed 35 people. Brave Chien-tsung was praised by Taiwan's vice president for steering the plane between apartment blocks and commercial buildings before ditching the stalled aircraft in a river. Aviation authorities also revealed today that both engines had lost power in the minutes before the crash, as grieving relatives visited the scene of the crash. Scroll down for video . Recovered: Soldiers pay their respects as a body is recovered from the wreckage of the doomed TransAsia flight that crashed in Taipei, Taiwan . Disaster: Emergency personnel retrieve the body of a passenger who died in the TransAsia Airways Flight GE235 plane crash, killing 35 people . Devastated: Grieving relatives visited the scene of the crash as rescuers continued to search for bodies. So far, 35 people have been confirmed killed, with 15 survivors and a further eight still missing . TransAsia Flight GE235, carrying 58 passengers and crew, lurched between buildings, clipped a taxi and an overpass with one of its wings and crashed on its left side into shallow water shortly after take-off on Wednesday. Thomas Wang, executive director of the Aviation Safety Council, said one of the engines went idle just 37 seconds after takeoff and the pilots may have shut off the remaining engine before attempting to restart them - but the plane crashed before that could happen. Mr Wang said: 'Based on the data we have so far we can see that for a period of time both engines showed no thrust. 'The right engine flamed out and triggered a warning in the cockpit. The left engine was shut down by command and the pilot tried to restart the engine but couldn't.' The plane's blackbox data showed that pilot Chien-tsung issued a 'mayday' call and announced an engine flameout 35 seconds after noticing engine failure, aviation authorities have revealed. Mr Wang added: 'The plane flashed a flameout signal for one of the two engines at 10:53:28 when the plane climbed to an altitude of 1,200 feet, triggering a warning. 'Then the other engine was shut down manually. The pilot tried to restart the engines but to no avail. That means that during the flight's final moments, neither engine had any thrust. We heard 'Mayday' at 10:54:35.' Wang said it was 'not clear' why the left engine was shut down manually and added: 'We are not reaching any judgement yet.' About one minute after the announced flameout, the black boxes stopped recording, the Aviation Safety Council said. A flameout can occur when the fuel supply to an engine is interrupted or when there is faulty combustion. Smash: Terrifying pictures showed the passenger plane plunging into a river near Taiwan's capital Taipei after clipping a bridge on the freeway . The bodies of Liao and his co-pilot were retrieved from the almost-new turboprop ATR 72-600's cockpit still clutching the joystick, with their legs badly broken, investigators said. 'They were still trying to save this aircraft until the last minute,' Taiwanese media quoted unidentified prosecutors involved in the crash investigation as saying. Taiwan's Vice President Wu Den-yih visited a funeral parlour for a prayer session to pay respects to the victims, many of whom were from mainland China, and praised the actions of pilot Chien-tsung. Mr Wu said: 'When it came to when it was clear his life would end, the pilot meticulously grasped the flight operating system and in the final moments he still wanted to control the plane to avoid harming residents in the housing communities. 'To the plane's crew, the victims...I express condolences.' It has also been revealed that a lucky family who survived the terrifying crash on Wednesday had swapped seats minutes before takeoff - a move which is likely to have saved their lives. The Lin family are reported to have asked to be moved from the left side to the right side after the father had 'heard a noise from the wing', according to local media. Their two-year-old son is believed to be the boy seen being pulled from the wreckage yesterday.

"Children of the 1960s and onwards have marvelled at slides showing everything from 3D scenes of the world to cartoon characters though their View-Master toy. Now, a retro-style invite issued by Google and toy maker Mattel hints that the toy might be getting a hi-tech makeover. While we can only guess at the result of the collaboration, the product will be unveiled next Friday morning in New York City. A retro-style invite issued by Google and toy maker Mattel hints that the toy might be getting a hi-tech makeover. The design of the invitation, together with the mention of ‘viewing’ seems to show View-Master reels may suggest that a digital version of the toy is in the pipeline . The invitation reads: ‘Mattel invites you to view what's possible with exclusive announcement and product debut’. The design of the invitation, which seems to show View-Master reels - together with the mention of ‘viewing’ - may suggest that a digital version of the toy is in the pipeline. Originally conceived in 1938, the View-Master, a handheld device showing 3D slides, was initially aimed at adults, but became a popular toy in the 1960s. The timing is appropriate too, because two days after the announcement, Toy Fair 2015 begins in Manhattan, The Verge noted. Originally conceived in 1938, the View-Master, a handheld device showing 3D slides, was originally aimed at adults, but became a popular toy in the 1960s (an old version of the toy is shown) Children of the 1960s and onwards have marvelled at slides showing everything from 3D scenes of the world (two examples are shown) to cartoon characters though their View-Master toy . In 1938, cameraman William Gruber produced 3-D colour slides for stereoscopes - which were popular in 19th century homes – using two cameras strapped together. An encounter with Harold Graves, president of Sawyer's Photographic Services in the Oregon Caves National Monument led to a partnership a year later. They came up with the View-Master – a new way of viewing tourist attractions in America – which was sold to adults in camera shops. It was only in the 1960s that the View-Master became a toy, and afterwards, cheap reels were produced showing scenes across the world, Disneyland and cartoon characters in ‘3D’. Today, the toy is produced by Fisher Price - part of the Mattel group. Numerous people taking to Twitter with their guesses have humerously suggested a ‘Glasshole Barbie’ could be revealed next week. 'Glasshole' was the derogative name given to wearers of Google's now retired smart spectacles. There is some speculation that Google may have re-focused its ‘Cardboard’ project for a young audience. Last summer, the Mountain View-based tech firm revealed a virtual reality headset made of cardboard, which was given out to attendees of the firm's annual developer conference. It used a mobile phones as the display, with a special app to show 3D images and video. Google seems to be intent of winning the hearts and minds of children, having announced this week that it has acquired Launchpad Toys, which is behind the iPad app Toontastic. Google has previously announced plans to make child-friendly versions of some of its products such as Chrome, YouTube and search, which are set to be released this year.

"Britain's use of intelligence hoovered up and stored by US mass surveillance programmes to spy on citizens was illegal, a tribunal has ruled. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) said the information-sharing regime between GCHQ and America's National Security Agency was a breach of human rights. The UK's eavesdropping service used vast amounts of personal information supplied by US spy chiefs, including websites visited, emails sent and received, text messages, calls and passwords. The UK's eavesdropping service used vast amounts of personal information supplied by US spy chiefs, including websites visited, emails sent and received, text messages, calls and passwords . The IPT, the only judicial body with the power to investigate MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, ruled the listening post had acted unlawfully when it used intercepted communications provided by top-secret US surveillance programmes called Prism and Upstream. However, after Britain's use of the controversial programmes were admitted by the Government in December last year, they immediately became legal. That means GCHQ is now free to carry on using data harvested by the US. Citizens who thinks their communications were intercepted by GCHQ prior to December can complain to the IPT and potentially have any records deleted. It is the first time the tribunal has ruled against an intelligence agency in its 15-year history. The judges said that before December it was illegal for intelligence chiefs to use information swept up by the programmes because the public were unaware of the safeguards in place. But when additional details about the bulk surveillance programme – just two paragraphs – were disclosed, this was sufficient to make the practice compliant with the European Court of Human Rights. Downing Street said that Prime Minister David Cameron believes the Government should make sure that the intelligence agencies 'continue to have the powers they need to keep us safe' Human rights groups Liberty, Privacy International and Amnesty launched the legal challenge against GCHQ following leaks by US fugitive Edward Snowden. He became one of the world's most wanted men after breaking cover as the civilian CIA worker who stole countless classified files from the US National Security Agency which exposed spy tactics used to track terror suspects. The human rights campaigners claimed that GCHQ's methods breached the right to privacy and protections on freedom of expression. They disagreed that the intelligence-sharing was lawful and vowed to challenge the tribunal's decision at the European Court of Human Rights. Liberty legal director James Welch said: 'We now know that, by keeping the public in the dark about their secret dealings with the National Security Agency, GCHQ acted unlawfully and violated our rights. 'The intelligence services retain a largely unfettered power to rifle through millions of people's private communications. The tribunal believes the limited safeguards revealed during last year's legal proceedings are an adequate protection of our privacy. We disagree. Eric King, deputy director of Privacy International, said: 'We must not allow agencies to continue justifying mass surveillance programs using secret interpretations of secret laws.' A GCHQ spokesman said: 'The IPT has found against the Government in one small respect in relation to the historic intelligence-sharing legal regime. 'The ruling re-affirms that the processes and safeguards within the intelligence-sharing regime were fully adequate at all times - it is simply about the amount of detail about those processes and safeguards that needed to be in the public domain.' Downing Street  said the judgment did not require GCHQ to change its operations. A spokesman said that Prime Minister David Cameron believes the Government should make sure that the intelligence agencies 'continue to have the powers they need to keep us safe'. 'The overall judgment this morning is that the UK's interception regime is fully lawful. That follows on from the court's clear rejection of accusations of mass surveillance in their December judgment, and we welcome that,' the spokesman said. 'It's important to be clear that the overall interception regime and bulk interception they found fully, fully lawful, and that it was compliant with the right to privacy at all times. 'What they said was, on the legal framework governing that, that there should be more about the rules that should be disclosed publicly. I think it was two paragraphs of additional detail, and the Government did that during the proceedings. 'They are not questioning in this judgment that the safeguarding of privacy was in any way jeopardised and the judgment will not require GCHQ to change what it does.'","Investigatory Powers Tribunal rules on information-sharing regime .

"A woman who was unable to leave the house for 14 years due to depression, is finally on the road to recovery. Linda Haberfield, now 60, from Southampton, became depressed while going through a divorce in 1991 and was so stressed, her hair began falling out. Too embarrassed to leave the house thanks to her non-existent locks, Ms Haberfield became a recluse for more than a decade but has now regained her confidence following a pioneering hair treatment. New life: Ms Haberfield lost her hair after succumbing to depression but has now had a treatment to regain it . Ms Haberfield's problems began during her divorce which, although amicable, left her the single mother of two young children. That, combined with a high pressure job and a diabetes diagnosis, resulted in a seriously stressed Ms Haberfield falling prey to depression. Although referred to a psychiatrist, her experience was not a happy one with the mother-of-two passed from medic to medic and prescribed an increasingly lengthy list of medication. 'Because I was only able to see registrars (people training to be psychiatrists), I would see a new person every year. 'They would ask the same questions over and over which would open up the wounds again. I was trapped in a cycle.' Things became worse when the resulting stress, coupled with her severe depression, left her hair falling out in clumps. Thinning: The stress of a divorce coupled with a diabetes diagnosis caused her hair to fall out in clumps . Hospitalised following a heart attack the following year. Ms Haberfield found herself unable work but was turned down when she applied for benefits. 'It was both financially and emotionally devastating,' said the former Tachograph Inspector, who says it was around then that she hit 'rock bottom'. 'All I did was cleaning,' she remembers. 'it was something to keep me busy as I couldn’t get out the house and it kept my mind occupied.' In 2000, she met her future husband Jeff, who was immensely supportive, taking care of both her, and her two young sons. 'He helped me emotionally as he was the only one at the time who could put up with what I was giving out,' she says. 'He also financially supported me, and was just there for absolutely anything I needed.' Her mother and sons also proved supportive and it was her mother who happened upon the hair treatment that has helped to restore her confidence. Restored: Hair expert Simone Thomas (left) designed a treatment that restored her confidence . After some convincing, Ms Haberfield agreed to see hair loss specialist Simone Thomas, who created a bespoke hair replacement system. Five weeks after starting treatment, her hair began to grow back and according to Ms Haberfield, she finally began to feel like herself again. Indeed, so dramatic has the transformation been, Ms Haberfield is finally leaving the house on a regular basis once more - something she had not done for 14 years. 'Linda is a beautiful person with an amazing, kind, warm personality,' explains Thomas. 'To help this much in her life is truly an honour. 'We fitted Linda with a bespoke Hair Replacement System with real hair which Linda is able to treat and wash as if it were her own hair. 'Although we have not known Linda long the whole team truly loves Linda and it is a pleasure to work with her. 'While tackling depression is an uphill battle, Linda now has a renewed fighting spirit and has now booked to go to Las Vegas, Los Angeles and the Caribbean.","Stress of a divorce and diabetes diagnosis impacted Linda's mental health .

"Labour's shadow education secretary has been accused of ‘denigrating’ Catholicism after he appeared to question whether nuns make good teachers. Tristram Hunt was criticised for comments he made on the BBC’s Question Time that seemed to challenge the quality of teaching provided by nuns. The remarks immediately sparked a furious reaction with the former TV historian condemned for being ‘rude’ and ‘arrogant’, but he has refused to apologise. Scroll down for video . Tristram Hunt was criticised for comments he made on the BBC’s Question Time that seemed to challenge the quality of teaching provided by nuns . During a debate over Labour's policy of requiring all teachers to have official qualifications on Thursday night, Mr Hunt clashed with fellow panellist Cristina Odone, a former editor of the Catholic Herald. The political commentator said some of her most inspiring teachers did not go to teacher training college and taught 'real values'. But Mr Hunt interjected: 'These were nuns, these were all nuns, weren't they?' He added: 'I know about your religious schooling and there is a difference between a State education system and having qualified teachers in the classroom.' Mr Hunt, who has opposed the use of unqualified teachers in classrooms, said: ‘I know about your religious schooling and there's a difference, I think, between a state education system having qualified teachers in the classroom.’ Miss Odone said she had been to a Catholic school, a state school and a private school and ‘the best (teachers) did not come out of teacher training college’. Following the exchanges on BBC's Question Time Miss Odone told her former publication: ‘Tristram Hunt's comments on nuns last night were arrogant and ignorant. ‘Why is it acceptable to denigrate anything Catholic but bleat tolerance about every other religion? ‘To know he and Labour stand a chance at the next election makes me fear for the 7,000 brilliant faith schools in this country.’ Mr Hunt clashed with fellow panellist Cristina Odone, (left), a former editor of the Catholic Herald . Miss Odone said she had been to a Catholic school, a state school and a private school and ‘the best (teachers) did not come out of teacher training college’ Mr Hunt's remarks also led to outrage on Twitter. Tory MP Conor Burns said: 'Absolutely shocking, sneering comments by Tristram Hunt about Catholic schools and nuns. 'I was educated by Brothers. Gave lives of service.' Former Labour Downing Street spin doctor Damian McBride said: . 'My mum spent most of her career teaching in a convent school, working alongside nuns. They gave incredible educations.' Fellow Tory Nadine Dorries said it was an ‘arrogant, sneering, intolerant remark’ and predicted it would damage Labour's electoral chances. ‘If Labour had any chance of holding onto its Catholic Glasgow seats, it lost it last night with Tristram Hunt's remarks,’ she said. Mr Hunt today responded to the row, but did not say sorry. He posted on Twitter: ‘On BBC QT I was trying to make a generalised point about the use of unqualified teachers in schools. I obviously meant no offence to nuns.’ Asked whether David Cameron believed nuns could make good teachers, a Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister thinks that there are a range of people who are well-qualified to be excellent teachers and it is obviously for headteachers to make those decisions on the ground. ‘What matters most is that children are getting the best quality education they can.’ Paul Barber, director of the Catholic Education Service, said: ‘Nuns and religious orders play a central role in the continuing success of Catholic education. Religious orders provided education in this country centuries before state funded education and they continue this work today. ‘They act as qualified teachers, school chaplains, governors and trustees. The vocational nature of religious life and their dedication to serving the poor and vulnerable has meant that hundreds of thousands of students have been given a first class education.’ Speaking after the programme, Miss Odone said  Mr Hunt's comments on nuns 'were arrogant and ignorant' A total of 26 Labour MPs went to Catholic schools, including six members of the shadow cabinet and shadow schools minister Kevin Brennan. Mr Hunt went to the fee-paying University College School in north London. The row comes days after Mr Hunt told a parent asking about Labour's plans for schools to 'stop moaning' and 'do some work'. Thomas Mann asked on Twitter if Mr Hunt could point him towards his education policies ahead of the general election. Mr Hunt replied with a link to Labour's website. But Mr Mann, from south London, responded that the site 'only contains soundbites' and asked for details covering 'the full complexity of education policy'. Mr Hunt then told Mr Mann: 'Stop moaning. Read the speeches. Do some work.' Mr Mann, a former Labour voter, tweeted back: 'Tell Ed you just lost a vote.' He added that he thought Mr Hunt was 'rude' and 'unhelpful'. 'He didn't even feign interest. He just got cross that we were asking him to earn his keep,' he wrote. 'I want a party that listens between elections. Remember who employs you.' Mr Mann said that education policy had become important to him after his child's school in Lewisham had become an academy.","Shadow education secretary clashed with columnist Christine Odone .

"With the snow thick on the ground in the snow-covered forests outside the east Russian city of Voronezh, food is in short supply. Which is perhaps why these two squirrels have such a dramatic reaction as they skirmish over a cone - and the precious seeds it contains. The amazing images, captured by photographer Vadim Trunov, appear to show one squirrel flying through the air to catch the cone after its companion throws it - but the truth is rather less friendly. Scroll down for video . A squirrel guards a pine cone as if its life depended on it as a rival critter tries to claim the food for itself in this image taken in Russia . The nature-lover lay in the snow just metres away from the squirrels as they squabbled over the pine cone, one of their preferred means of sustenance. Trunov, 30, recalls the first squirrel setting its sights on a pine cone that he had placed in a clearing before it began to extract the seeds inside. Soon a jealous fellow squirrel arrived in a bid to get a taste of the fallen food. The duo lunge at each other and at times soar through the air as they battle for dominance. But the original squirrel was never going to give up its find easily and manages to scare the other away. 'I put a pine cone in the snow, walked away, and waited,' Trunov said of his wildlife shoot. 'After some time, the squirrel ran up and started to gnaw it hungrily. Photographer Vadim Trunov lay in the snow just metres away from the pair of squirrels as they squabbled over a pine cone . Although they were in anything but an amiable interaction, the squirrels looked like they were playing catch in the snow . 'A little while later a second squirrel appeared, this one tried to banish the first squirrel and lunged at her. It was amazing to see because they both would spring into the air, it was truly fascinating to watch. 'But the first one squirrel was not going to give her cone. She grabbed the cone and jumped to her. Then she attacked and chased away her opponent.' After a fierce showdown the squirrel with the pine cone continues extracting seeds from the pine cone . Vadim says he was barely a few metres away from the squirrels as he lay in the snow to photograph them. 'Squirrels love to eat nuts and cones that's why decided to give the squirrel a cone. 'Inside these cones are the seeds which squirrels love to eat. They gnaw the cone, and take out the seeds from there.'","Photographer Vadim Trunov lay in the snow metres from a pair of squirrels as they squabbled over a pine cone .

"Despite claims we’re obsessed with always having the latest and greatest gadgets, millions of us still hoard old and out-of-date devices. Living room TVs are relegated to bedrooms, and phones are handed down to children, for example. And although it may seem like you’re saving money by doing this, the amount of extra energy they use can end up costing more – financially and in terms of the environment. Experts estimated energy use of individual products using the Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment database and studied consumer reports to estimate usage between 1992 and 2007 (pictured).

"The flu jab crisis deepened last night after officials admitted they had suspected the vaccine was ineffective last summer – but failed to take action. The Government’s public health agency announced late on Thursday that this year’s flu vaccine worked for only 3 per cent of patients. That is because the main strain of the virus has mutated to such an extent that it no longer matches the jab, which was developed almost a year ago. Scroll down for video . The Government’s public health agency announced on Thursday that this year’s flu vaccine worked for only 3 per cent of patients. Officials admitted they suspected the vaccine was ineffective last summer (file picture) Figures suggest the infection has already claimed the lives of thousands of elderly patients who would have mistakenly assumed they were protected. Death rates are 40 per cent higher than last year. There is also evidence that babies and young children have died from the virus because mortality rates for last month were ‘higher than expected’. But yesterday Professor Nick Phin, director of the Department of Infectious Diseases at Public Health England, said they had been made aware that a mutant strain had emerged in Australia ‘last summer’. He said that the flu viruses that arrive in the UK tend to mirror those which have been present in the Southern Hemisphere during their winter, which is six months earlier than ours. In the United States the government issued a warning in early December before the flu season had begun that it could be ‘potentially severe’. The Center For Disease Control sent out a statement on December 4 stating that scientists were aware that certain mutant strains of the virus were circulating which may be resistant to the jab. Patients at high risk – the elderly, pregnant women and those with underlying health complaints – were urged to see a doctor as soon as they had flu-like symptoms including a runny nose, fever, cough or aches and pains. Doctors were told to prescribe antiviral medications to these patients as soon as they suspected flu. But otherwise healthy individuals were urged to stay at home, rather than seeing a doctor, to prevent spreading it to more vulnerable groups. Scientists in the US have since carried out detailed research to assess the effectiveness of the jab and the findings have been shared with the public. One such study published last month suggested they were just 23 per cent effective, although rates vary between states. Professor Phin said a further warning was sounded in early December when scientists detected the same mutant virus had arrived in Britain – but it wasn’t deemed serious because cases were only in ‘low numbers’. But in the US government officials were far more concerned and warned the public two months ago to prepare for a ‘potentially severe flu season’ because the vaccines might not work. Elderly patients, pregnant women and those with long-term conditions were urged to seek help as soon as they experienced symptoms and doctors were told to prescribe them Tamiflu, an antiviral treatment for flu. Officials at the US Center For Disease Control also advised otherwise healthy adults to stay at home if they became ill so as not to spread the virus. But there were no similar warnings in Britain and experts at Public Health England just hoped the same mutant strain that was rampant in Australia and America would not arrive here. There are now growing concerns that deaths could have been avoided and vulnerable patients prevented from becoming seriously ill had officials followed the same precautions. Roger Goss, of campaign group Patient Concern, said: ‘It’s extremely worrying. People who had the jabs should have been made aware that they needed to be more careful not to catch the virus and more alert to symptoms. ‘This failure to be open and honest may have contributed to some of the thousands of deaths.’ Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, said: ‘It beggars belief that health officials weren’t aware just how badly the vaccine was working a long time ago.’ The crisis has come about because the vaccines are developed in February, ten months before the flu season usually gets under way in Britain in December. The NHS spends around £100million each year on the flu vaccination programme, with each jab costing £7.60. Although it is never totally effective, it usually protects around 60 per cent of patients (file picture) Experts predicted H3N2 (pictured) would be the most dominant virus but it has now mutated to such an extent that it no longer matches the vaccine - which was developed almost a year ago . Scientists from the World Health Organisation predict which three main strains of flu are likely to be circulating and the jabs are manufactured to protect against them. Dr John McCauley, of the Medical Research Council, said the decision was ‘not straightforward’ this year because there are two strains in circulation. Warning: Professor Nick Phin, director of the Department of Infectious Diseases at Public Health England, said they had been made aware that a mutant strain had emerged ‘last summer’ Experts said this year’s vaccine’s ineffectiveness was the worst in at least 20 years. Although it is never failsafe, it usually protects around 60 per cent of patients. A spokesman for Public Health England said: ‘We saw that there were going to be drifts but we thought it was going to be less significant.’ Asked when they had first become aware of the mutation, the official initially said August and then clarified it to ‘within the last few months’. A spokesman for the Prime Minister would not confirm if Government officials were made aware of the mutant strain in March. The spokesman added: ‘The current vaccine is still protecting against two strains of flu so there is still a benefit to getting the vaccine.’ Experts now fear the death toll for this winter from flu and cold weather will surpass 40,000, the worst in 15 years. Data from the Office for National Statistics shows that there were 25,231 deaths in the over-65s in the two weeks leading up to January 23, a 40 per cent rise on last year. And the most recent weekly flu report from Public Health England states that deaths in the under-fives in January were ‘higher than expected’, although it does not provide figures. In normal years, the majority of the over-65s are protected from flu as they receive the jab for free on the NHS. Children aged two to four are also offered the jab while toddlers and babies will have some protection from their mothers being vaccinated in pregnancy. What’s gone wrong? Health officials announced on Thursday that this year’s flu vaccine protected only 3 per cent of patients. The vaccine was developed nearly a year ago and since then the virus has mutated so it no longer matches. This is unprecedented as although the vaccine is never failsafe, it normally protects at least 60 per cent of patients. Why didn’t health officials alert the public sooner? Public Health England, the responsible Government agency, says it wasn’t sure of the extent of the problem until a few days ago when research into the lack of effectiveness was published. But it knew the virus had mutated elsewhere in August and hoped that strain wouldn’t arrive in Britain. The US government was much more alert to the problem and issued a warning in early December before the flu season had arrived. This told at-risk patients to seek help as soon as they experienced symptoms and doctors to prescribe Tamiflu, a prescription medication that reduces the severity of flu. I’m in the ‘at-risk’ patient group – what should I do? It’s not too late to get the flu jab if you are over 65, pregnant or have an underlying health condition such as asthma. Although it doesn’t protect against the main mutant strain, it should still protect against two other types that are circulating in some areas of the country and may become more widespread later this winter. Flu levels are much lower now than they were a month ago but you should still follow basic hygiene to avoid catching it. This includes washing hands, disinfecting surfaces and avoiding close contact with others who are ill. Tamiflu is available only on prescription and your GP will prescribe it if you are an at-risk patient with flu . Is another vaccine available? No. The vaccines take nine to ten months to produce and none have yet been developed to prevent this mutant strain. Should I be stocking up on Tamiflu? No. Tamiflu is available only on prescription and your GP will prescribe it if you are an at-risk patient with flu. There is no reason otherwise healthy patients should take this drug to prevent flu as it can cause serious and unpleasant side effects. These include headaches, dizziness, cough, sickness, indigestion and, less commonly, heart problems, seizures and eczema. Opinions are also divided as to whether it prevents flu in patients who don’t yet have the virus. How much has this cost taxpayers? The NHS spends around £100million a year on its flu immunisation campaign which offers the jab free of charge to vulnerable groups. A further £1.5million goes towards a marketing campaign with TV and radio adverts urging at-risk patients to come forward for their jabs. But officials insist it hasn’t all been a waste of money as the jabs may still protect against other strains of flu that could emerge later this year. What will happen next year? Scientists from the World Health Organisation will meet this month to predict which strains of flu are likely to be present next winter – and vaccine production will get under way. But the vaccines will almost certainly be developed to protect against this mutant strain of H3N2 in case it is still in circulation. Experts hope this winter has just been a one-off and next year’s jabs will resume the usual effectiveness level of at least 60 per cent. And they say it is crucial that vulnerable groups receive the vaccine as normal next autumn as it remains the best way of preventing flu.","Officials admitted they had suspected the vaccine was ineffective last year .
Professor Phin said alarm was raised last summer but action wasn't taken .
Flu jab, which usually protects around 60% of patients, only worked for 3% .

"One shopper was just picking up a few essentials from her local Target on Wednesday when she happened upon a heartwarming scene between an employee and a young man. Audrey Mark took a picture of the employee, now identified as Dennis Roberts, helping the unidentified young man tie a tie so he could look professional for a job interview at a nearby Chick-Fil-A fast-food restaurant. Ms Mark posted the sweet photo online, and now both Mr Roberts and the chain are receiving praise for the extraordinary act that went above and beyond customer service. Heartwarming: A shopper at a Raleigh, North Carolina Target took this picture on Wednesday of a store employee helping a young man learn to tie a tie for a job interview at a nearby Chick Fil-A . Customer service! Store employee Dennis Roberts (pictured) also gave the young man a few interview tips before he left the store . Scene: Above, the Raleigh, North Carolina Super Target where the kind act happened on Wednesday . Mr Roberts' coworker Cathy Scott was the first to greet the customer on Wednesday when he came in looking for a clip-on tie for his interview. Since the store was out of the clip-on ties, she directed him to the regular ties but he didn't know how to tie it. Good job: Both Mr Roberts and the Target chain are receiving praise for helping the boy out. Mr Roberts went to the Chick Fil-A the next day to see if the young man got the job, but the manager hadn't made his decision yet . After checking out, Ms Scott brought the boy back to her co-worker Mr Roberts. 'Cathy says, ""Can you tie a tie?"" I said, ""Yes,""' Mr Roberts told WTVD. 'We took the wrapping off it, and I tied it on my neck, and fit it over head adjusted it and tightened it...fixed all his collar buttons and he was set to go.' And that's not all - Mr Roberts went on to help the young man prepare for his job interview by asking him the typical questions a hiring manager would ask. 'We said, ""Make sure you look him in the eye."" I'm saying make sure you give him a firm handshake, and she showed him... he tucked his shirt in,' said Mr Roberts. It was when he was giving the young man advice that Ms Mark snapped her now-viral photo. ""It was a very quiet simple moment, but it was very profound honestly kindness... from strangers... in a Super Target,' Ms Mark, a mother of three, said.  'He leaves and all these Target employees are screaming 'Bye! Good luck! Tell us how it went.'"" The young man left the store as the Mr Roberts and the other employees wished him good luck and asked him to come back and tell them how it went. 'We were just here to help a young man get a job and forward his future,' Mr Roberts said. Mr Roberts, Ms Scott and some other employees went to the Chick-Fil-A on Thursday to see if the young man got the job, but the manager said he hadn't yet made his decision. According to a Facebook post by Mr Robert's daughter Sarah, he told the manager that 'if they don't hire him Target will!'","Young man in a suit came in to Raleigh, North Carolina Target to buy a clip-on tie for job interview at Chick Fil-A .

"A mother questioned over the death of her six-month-old son was yesterday revealed to be an on-the-run Polish killer. The 30-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested after her son suffered fatal head injuries. Social services from the same council that failed Baby P ruled he was not at risk, despite knowing about her criminal record. Dark past: The mother, 30 (pictured with her son) was jailed for 12 years in her home country after a man was stabbed during a burglary gone wrong, but fled to the UK after being released on licence . Failings: Haringey child protection officers were told of the mother's past conviction, but decided not to put her son on the 'at risk' register before he died of head injuries . And the authorities face further questions over why she even remained in the UK more than four years after she absconded from her home country. The Daily Mail can reveal that the killer has attended 14 extradition hearings since her arrest in January last year but remained at large wearing an electronic tag. The young boy, known only as Baby O, was rushed to hospital from his home in Haringey, north London, last month after his parents dialled 999. He was treated at Great Ormond Street Hospital, where he died three days later. A post-mortem examination found he died from a head injury, raising fears that he may have been attacked. His mother and her boyfriend, a 26-year-old unemployed Pole, were arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. It can be revealed that the woman was jailed for 12 years in her homeland in 2002 after a man was stabbed to death during a bungled burglary. She was released on licence in March 2011 but fled the country, triggering a manhunt that led to her arrest 13 months ago. Haringey Council faces serious questions over what its staff knew about the boy and whether they took all possible steps to ensure his safety. Police and a hospital had already voiced their concerns to the local authority but social workers did not put Baby O on the ‘at risk’ register. Tragic: Haringey social services were accused of failing Baby P - now known as Peter Connelly - after he died from more than 50 separate injuries in 2007 . The council endured a storm of criticism after the death of 17-month-old Peter Connelly, known as Baby P, in August 2007. He suffered horrendous injuries at the hands of mother Tracey Connelly, her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen that went unchallenged. Neighbours of the Polish couple claimed ambulances were repeatedly called to the property. One woman said: ‘In July, I heard a baby crying desperately from the house. An ambulance came around 15 times over the summer, always in the night. The paramedics would knock on my door and ask if I had called the ambulance and I said I hadn’t. ‘That’s why I thought the child was sick. I think the mother was calling the ambulance.’ The neighbour added that police conducted door-to-door inquiries after the baby was taken to hospital with fatal injuries. Yesterday there were abandoned mattresses and overflowing bins outside the council house where Baby O was found. Charity Kidscape said: ‘Despite repeated findings calling for urgent reforms we are again faced with the avoidable death of a baby known to those who should have protected him.’ A Haringey Council spokesman said: ‘The council is working with the police to understand the circumstances surrounding this tragic incident. 'The independent Local Safeguarding Children Board will consider commissioning a review.’ A Met spokesman said the couple have been released on bail until later this month pending further inquiries.

"Are you desperate to lose weight but constantly hungry when dieting? Does the thought of going to the gym fill you with dread? A new diet promises to avoid all of this – while allowing you to eat foods traditionally banned on weight loss plans. Called The High Fat Diet, it claims to facilitate up to 10lb of weight loss in just 14 days. Developed by nutritionist and personal trainer Zana Morris, the diet is a combination of high-fat nutrition and high-intensity training. The premise is that rather than fat being demonised, it actually makes you thinner. In a nutshell, you need to eat fat to get rid of fat. Scroll down for video . The High Fat diet promises up to 10lb of weight loss in 2 weeks - because fat stabilises insulin levels . Over 12 years, Ms Morris has seen thousands of people lose an average of 6-8 lb (2.7-3.6 kg) and 1-3 inches (2.5-7.5 cm) from around their middle, in as little as two weeks. ‘Some lose as much as 12lb (5.4 kg)’, she says. And, as the plan is designed to help reset the hormonal balance of the body, she claims it’s also easy to keep the weight off. In a new book about the plan, Ms Morris says: 'It literally turns every­thing you thought you knew about weight loss on its head. 'Forget counting calories, feeling hungry, hours of exercise or months of watching the scales slowly shift downwards, and forget bran or anything else that tastes like cardboard.' Instead, those on the plan eat plenty of high-fat foods - like nuts, avocado, butter and even cream cheese. They also do a maximum of 12 minutes of exercise a day - none of which is on a running machine or exercise bike. Here, in an extract from the book, The High Fat Diet, the authors explain the science... Those on the plan eat plenty of high-fat foods - such as nuts, avocados, butter and even cream cheese . HOW EATING FAT MAKES YOU THINNER . The reason the diet works is the impact fat has on a hormone called insulin. Released when you eat, insulin's job is to shuttle glucose, the sugar our body normally uses for energy, into cells where it can be used as fuel. How much insulin you produce depends on which foods you consume. Sugar and carbohydrates (which your body converts quickly into glucose) produce the highest level. Protein, which takes a bit more effort to turn into glucose, creates a smaller rise. • You lose weight: On average 6-8 lb (2.7-3.6 kg) in two weeks. • You lose inches: Usually 1-3 inches (2.5-7.5cm) off the tummy and waist and more elsewhere. • Your skin looks amazing: Fat plumps up skin and by the end of the plan you could find your skin is glowing and fine lines and wrinkles have virtually disappeared. Dietary fat, however, takes a few complicated steps to convert to glucose and therefore doesn't trigger any direct rise in insulin at all. Swap to a diet that consists of a lot of high-fat foods and very few carbohydrates and you create a situation where insulin is low and you remove your body's normal source of fuel. At this point it has to do something to get the energy it needs, and that something is to switch to using fat instead (a state scientists call ketosis). Every time a little bit of fat leaves the cells to be used as energy the fat cells get smaller and lighter - and so do you. THE FILL-UP FACTOR . Hunger is a common reason people find diets hard to stick to, but it's very hard to be hungry eating just fat and protein. One reason is that ketones released as you start to burn fat suppress appetite. The combination also avoids sudden peaks and troughs in blood sugar that cause food cravings. Finally, fat digests slowly, keeping you fuller longer. Can you imagine what difference that would make to eradicating 3pm sugar cravings? Fat is also mentally satisfying. We enjoy eating it and many people on low-fat diets miss the creamy sensation it offers. Fat is also mentally satisfying, claim the experts behind the diet. 'Humans are programmed to enjoy eating it and many people on low-fat diets miss the creamy sensation it offers,' they say . Combining the physical effects on blood sugar - and the psychological boost of being able to eat a food most of us enjoy- can make diets containing fat more satisfying and easier to stick to than low-fat regimes. But is it OK to eat all this fat? Well, much of the fat you're eating on the plan comes from sources of unsaturated fat that no expert is going to argue are bad for you - avocados, walnuts, oily fish and olive oil . However, you are also adding in foods like butter, cream cheese, red meat and full-fat cheese, which contain saturated fat. For the last 65 years, intake of saturated fat has been blamed for high cholesterol, heart disease, obesity and more. However, a number of scientists and cardiologists are now disputing this. Last year, for example, University of Cambridge scientists analysed a group of 72 studies looking into the risk of saturated fat and heart disease. This revealed no difference in heart-disease risk between those consuming the highest and lowest intakes of saturated fat. This led the researchers to suggest more trials are needed to confirm officially whether saturated fat is good or bad. ALL CALORIES ARE NOT EQUAL . A strange thing happens when you eat lots of fat that seems to boost weight-loss results. On our high-fat plan you could be eating 1,500 to 2,500 calories a day and still lose about 1/2 lb a day (often far more) – that’s more than should be theoretically possible. Experts call this 'the metabolic advantage'. This describes the anomaly that when you eat a high percentage of calories from fat in a diet, you seem to increase the number of calories you can consume yet still lose weight. The High Fat Diet by Zana Morris and Helen Foster (Vermilion, £7.99) AND THE EXERCISE? High-intensity workouts, lasting 10-15 minutes, have been validated by numerous studies as one of the most effective ways of not only decreasing body fat - but also increasing muscle mass, strength, performance and endurance. This type of training helps stimulate muscle fibres, increases metabolism post workout and activates release of a muscle-building and fat-burning hormone called human growth hormone (hGh). When it comes to body sculpting, hGh is vital. To produce the highest hGh levels though, scientists say there are three key things you need to do: . 1. Train using large muscle groups . 2. Train at a high intensity- that means with heavy weights or at speed . 3. Train with the shortest rest intervals between sets . So that's the type of plan you're going to be doing. No wonder you only need 12 minutes daily to get results - you're working hard and working effectively. But don't be fooled: just because it's short, doesn't mean it's easy.

"NBA star Chris Paul has criticized one of the league's two female referees after she slapped him with a technical foul following an on-pitch dispute. The Clippers All-Star guard was pulled up by Lauren Holtkamp while attempting to inbound the ball quickly following a Cleveland free throw in his side's 105-94 loss to the Cavaliers on Thursday night. But he challenged the referee to explain her move after he was given a technical foul - one of five given to Los Angeles during the game. Referee Lauren Holtkamp (left) slapped Los Angeles Clippers guard Chris Paul (right) with a technical foul after he questioned one of her decisions. After the game, which the Clippers lost 105-94, Paul criticised her . After the game Paul said: 'The tech I got was ridiculous. That's terrible. There's no way that can be a technical. We try to get the ball out fast every time down the court. 'When we did that, she said, ""Uh-uh""' I said, ""Why uh-uh?"" and she gave me a technical. That's ridiculous. If that's the case, this might not be for her.' The technical foul came in the third quarter from Holtkamp, who worked with officials Ken Mauer and Eric Lewis. Los Angeles was given five technicals in total during the game — four in the third quarter, three of them in a 52-second span. Los Angeles Clippers Chris Paul was also called for a flagrant foul against Cleveland Cavaliers Timofey Mozgov during the second quarter in Cleveland . Los Angeles Clippers head coach Doc Rivers yells to players during the first quarter of an NBA basketball game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday in Cleveland. The Cavaliers defeated the Clippers 105-94 . Paul got his technical with 10 minutes 17 seconds left in the third. Following a free throw by Cleveland, the Clippers were attempting to inbound the ball quickly when Holtkamp, one of two active female officials in the NBA, stepped in. Clippers coach Doc Rivers also received a technical and forward Matt Barnes was ejected in the third by Lewis after getting his second 'T.' Barnes got tangled up with Cavaliers forward Kevin Love, shoved him and got the technical. He got the second one when he complained about teammate Jamal Crawford getting called for a charging foul and told Lewis, 'Don't give them the game.' Barnes is tied for the league lead with 11 technicals and has been ejected twice. 'It keeps happening,' Barnes said. 'Some of these I earn, some of them I don't.'

"A customer who bought a Big Mac meal in Japan was shocked to discover a human tooth in the fries - in the latest food safety scandal that has led to plummeting sales in the country this year. Japanese officials apologized to the customer for the incident, which occurred in August last year, and said none of the employees at the branch in question had lost a tooth. They added there were no signs the tooth had been fried - and said they are investigating how it came to be in the fries. Scroll down for video . A customer in Japan who bought a Big Mac meal was horrified to discover a human tooth in the fries . Senior executive Takehiko Aoki said: 'To make such cases zero is our goal. We are doing our utmost to tackle them, one by one.' He added: 'I will eat McNuggets. I will feed McNuggets to my children. I have no doubts.' McDonald's is extremely popular in Japan with more than 3,000 restaurants. But a series of recent scares, including customers finding fillings and plastic in chicken nuggets, has led to the company reporting its first annual operating loss in Japan. Sales for January fell by a record 39%, and over the course of 2014, losses totaled 6.7billion yen - or $57 million. This is compared with an operating profit of 11.5billion yen a year earlier. In December last year, a child was injured by a piece of plastic in an ice cream sundae in a McDonald's in Japan. McDonald's Japan chief executive Sarah Casanova, pictured speaking at a news conference yesterday, said the company was determined to restore its reputation after sales were battered by a food safety scandals . According to the fast food chain, the fragment had fallen into the dispenser while it was assembled. In two other cases, pieces of plastic were found in Chicken McNuggets, delivered from a plant in Thailand. One was blue, and could have fallen in during production, but the other was clear, a type not used at McDonald's, said officials. Mr Aoki denied these cases highlight an overall quality-control problem and branded them 'isolated' incidents. He acknowledged there were other cases, including a piece metal in a pancake and plastic in a McMuffin, but declined to give a tally of the total number of incidents. But he also added that it was possible that outsiders had planted the tooth and other items. Over the years, the restaurant has survived ""mad cow"" scares and general health worries about high calories. McDonald's is extremely popular in Japan, with more than 3000 outlets but customers have been driven away after a shortage of fries and series of food safety failings . Last year, orders for fries were limited to small servings because of a potato shortage. Large fries only came back recently. The problems are an added distraction for McDonald's Corp, the world's largest restaurant chain by sales, which last month replaced its CEO with Chief Brand Officer Steve Easterbrook following one of its worst financial years in decades. McDonald's in China and Japan along with other fast food chains were hit by a scandal last year over expired meat from a Chinese supplier. The Japan unit, 49.9% owned by McDonald's Corp, was hit after a major Chinese supplier of chicken was found to have been in breach of food safety standards. McDonald's Japan chief executive Sarah Casanova said the company was determined to restore its reputation. 'We serve billions of menu items every year and in the food industry we understand these kind of issues should never happen. It's our responsibility to do everything we can to obtain as close to zero as possible,' she said. The company has also announced plans for third-party inspections of its kitchens, fresh training for staff and sharing of information about suppliers on its website. Shares in McDonald's Japan fell 1 percent prior to the earnings release. They have lost around 12 percent since last year's peak in June.","Customer bought a Big Mac meal in Japan and found a tooth in the fries .

"Looking forlorn and cramped in a tiny cage strewn with empty beer bottles and other rubbish, it is no life for an animal more used to roaming the forests. Yet details have emerged about a shocking catalogue of abuse inflicted on two bears in Russia that has culminated with them being left alcoholics and in need of medical treatment. Prosecutors have revealed that for the past two decades a Sochi restaurant owner has allowed his guests to ply the animals with drink as part of some macabre spectacle. Scroll down for video . Barely able to stand: Empty beer bottles are strewn across the cramped cage the creatures were kept in. Both had become alcoholics after 20 years of abuse . Grizzly: One bear looks worse for wear after being fed beer and junk food by diners at a Russian restaurant . Court officials in Sochi, home to the 2014 Winter Olympic Games, have seized the bears, following protests from the local community. But Sergey Zenkov, the head of the Krasnodar regional agency for the protection of wildlife, said there could be problems in rehoming the animals as a result of their health. One of them has also gone blind because of motorists parking outside the prison-like cage with their dazzling headlights on, in a bid to deliberately cause the bears distress. Drunken stupor: He might look happy but years of cruelty have taken their toll on two caged bears in Russia. Both needed medical treatment after being plied with alcohol for two decades . Caged: A new home is being sought for the disheveled animals, who have spent the last 20 years, as a prized animal attraction. Their freedom was secured after protests from locals . He said: 'The animals definitely should not be held in such conditions. But there are many legal obstacles if someone wants to take them away, even with a court decision. 'We will consult with lawyers when we get the court decision.' It is thought the bears first appeared at the Patskha-Guria restaurant about 20 years ago when they were cubs. To begin with the owner Dzheniks Uzaroshvili charged people to have their picture taken with his new pets. But as they grew older, and bigger, they were placed in a small pen. Visitors continued to come to his restaurant to see his animal attraction and he started allowing people to give them beer and junk food for entertainment. Attraction: Visitors flock to see the two bears at a restaurant in Russia. The animals were taken into care after suffering severe health problems brought on by a diet of junk food and beer . Prisoner:  One bear looks desperately sad to be kept as an 'animal amusement' in a small cage, next to a restaurant. It was rescued with its cell-mate after being fed with junk food and beer for two decades . Dirty den: The bears were rescued from terrible conditions following complaints from locals. After a court hearing in Sochi, it transpired the owner already had charges for not giving suitable provision to his animals . Sleeping it off: The bears take a nap in squalid conditions in their home  in Russia . Mr Uzaroshvili insisted the bears were being kept in normal conditions, telling journalists: 'Beer is good for them because they live in such a climate.' However, a number of local people complained about the treatment and protests were held in front of the premises. 'Nobody has ever done a normal veterinary examination of these bears,' said one nearby resident, called Natalia. 'They do not get proper food, they do not have clean water, and there is only a stinking liquid, consisting of a small amount of water and animals' own urine. 'There are also people who make fun of the poor animals. Visitors of the restaurant regularly give the bears alcoholic beverages to drink and feed them with chips, cakes and other unsuitable food.' As Khostinskyi court in Sochi ruled that the bears should be taken from the restaurant, it emerged that the owner already had charges for not giving suitable provision to his animals. The Ministry of Natural Resources in the Krasnodar region must now find new accommodation for the bears. Bears are held in high esteem across Russia, with the animal even named as the official mascot of the 2014 Winter Olympics .

"Scientists have finally discovered why residents in a remote Kazakhstan village known as Sleepy Hollow are mysteriously falling asleep for days at a time. They claim radon gas from nearby Soviet-era uranium mines seeped up to the surface and poisoned the residents of Kalachi. Radon is a colourless, odourless and tasteless gas which occurs naturally through the decay of uranium and breathing it is thought to cause lung cancer. Local government officials are considering plans to move the entire village because they feel it is impossible to eradicate radon gas from the area. Although radiation levels in the mines themselves are not thought to be dangerous, they have left a deadly legacy for the villagers above. 'Sleepy Hollow': After four years of studies, scientists have finally discovered the cause of a mysterious illness which caused people to fall asleep for days . Radiation: Scientists say radon, which occurred naturally from uranium in nearby mines, seeped to the surface and poisoned the residents of Kalachi . Deadly: Radon - a colourless, odourless and tasteless gas - is thought to cause lung cancer and has affected around one in five people in Kalachi (pictured) Radioactive remains: Although radiation levels in the mines themselves are not thought to be dangerous, they have left a deadly legacy for the villagers above . Professor Leonid Rikhvanov from the Department of Geo-ecology and Geo-chemistry concluded the local mines were to blame after ruling out a virus or bacteria as the cause. He said: 'The mines left open spaces underground which were slowly filled with water that has risen upwards, driving pockets of gas inside them to the surface. 'The gas has a toxic effect that pushes a person into a dream like state, and the person then falls asleep.' Professor Rikhavanov and Tomsk Polytechnic University have carried out thousands of experiments on the area for over four years. They failed to find radon because conventional methods of measuring radiation do not detect it in the air. He added: 'We eliminated viral and bacterial infections but also obtained test results that ruled out the possibility of radiation sickness too. 'We also failed to find any evidence that toxic chemicals were buried in the area as many locals claimed.' Initially, medics who examined the dozing villagers found they were suffering from excessive fluid in the brain but could not work out why. Desperate measures: Local government officials in Kalachi (pictured) are now considering plans to move the village entirely . Infected: Children affected by the mystery illness are so dizzy they can barely stand up by themselves and spend days at a time in bed . Nightmare: Professor Leonid Rikhvanov from the Department of Geo-ecology and Geo-chemistry said the 'toxic gas' induces its victims 'into a dream like state' Doctor Egor Korovin, who examined the victims, said: 'In medical terms they are suffering from encephalopathy, a disorder of the brain but the cause is unclear. 'Scans have shown that many of the sufferers have excessive accumulation of fluid in their brains.' According to the National Cancer Institute, radon decays quickly, giving off tiny radioactive particles. When inhaled, these radioactive particles can damage the cells that line the lung. Long-term exposure to radon can lead to lung cancer, the only cancer proven to be associated with inhaling radon. There has been a suggestion of increased risk of leukemia associated with radon exposure in adults and children however, the evidence is not conclusive. Radon is present in nearly all air. Everyone breathes in radon every day, usually at very low levels. However, people who inhale high levels of radon are at an increased risk of developing lung cancer. Last summer, 60 people were taken to hospital suffering from the condition which leaves people feeling dizzy, unable to stand, fatigued and with memory problems. Children affected by the mystery illness could barely stand up by themselves and spend days at a time in bed. Scientists recently stepped up their investigation after locals complained the situation was getting worse. It is thought nearly one in five of Kalachi's 600 residents have been affected by the strange sleep disorder. Scientists stepped up the investigation recently after locals complained that incidences of the strange sleeping disorder were getting worse, with nearly one in five of the village's 600 residents now affected. They said the fact that some miners remained unaffected because they have built up a natural immunity to radon. Alsu Shjeladeva, a local resident, said some men from the area had gone down the shaft in one of the mines and detected a sweet smell while down there. The 54-year-old told Russia Today: 'We are afraid of what lies in store. We're afraid that we may all fall asleep.' Ghost town: Kalachi's neighbouring town Krasnogorsk has been deserted since the closure of the neighbouring uranium mine . Terrifying discovery: A Russia Today film crew found radiation levels at a filled in mine shaft were 16 times higher than normal background levels . Top secret: In the Soviet era, Krasnogorsk was a secret and 'closed' uranium mining town run directly from Moscow . Another resident Igor Samusenko, whose son suffers from the condition, said: 'He runs around and then he gets inert, starts staggering.

"Police have mounted uniformed patrols around an Army Reserve after two girl cadets were threatened with beheading as they left the centre. Two men had shouted the violent threats as they drove past the teenage cadets, who weren't in uniform at the time. The pair, driving in a Vauxhall Zafira, were said to have asked the girls if they were in the army before threatening them with beheading. Police have issued a photo of two men in a car after two teenage girls were threatened with beheading as they left an Army Reserve Centre . Two girl cadets were threatened with beheading by men as they left the Army Reserve Centre in Gateshead (pictured) Police have traced the car, which is left-hand drive and appears to have foreign plates, and were trying to establish the identity of the occupants. The driver was described as black or Asian, in his 40s, and of plump or muscular build with a black bushy beard and wearing dark clothes. The passenger was also said to be black or Asian, in his 30s, and had short black hair and stubble. It comes weeks after British police forces warned officers not to wear uniforms on the way to work after an ISIS-style plot to kidnap and behead an officer. More than 7,000 officers in the West Midlands were warned they were in imminent danger following an anonymous telephone call to their headquarters on December 8. Other forces urgently reviewed safety precautions and warned officers not to wear their uniform or ID badge when off duty. The threat comes amid fears extremists will attempt to copy the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby (pictured), which led to soldiers being warned not to wear their uniform off duty . The official threat level to officers came amid fears extremists will attempt to copy the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby, which has led to soldiers being warned not to wear their uniform off duty. ISIS has previously called on followers to launch 'lone wolf' attacks on the West. Extra patrols have now been put in place around the Army Reserve centre in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, formerly the Territorial Army, after the violent threats against the girl cadets. Other Army Reserve centres have also been alerted since the incident at 9.15pm on Wednesday January 21. Gateshead Superintendent Richie Jackson said: 'The men made no attempt to make any physical contact with the girls or get out of the car, and shouted the comments while driving away from the scene. 'Inquiries are ongoing to establish the exact nature of what was said during the incident and we have spoken to the two teenage girls, viewed CCTV footage from the area and have identified the vehicle and inquiries are ongoing to trace the driver. 'As a precaution we have notified staff at other Army Reserve centres in the area and have had extra officers on patrol in Alexandra Road to reassure residents. 'Although this is concerning, it is an isolated incident and if anyone has any information that could help us with the investigation I'd ask that they contact us on 101.' A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'We are aware of an incident allegedly involving members of the Army Cadet Force - this is a matter for the police and we cannot comment further. Any witnesses are urged to contact the police. 'We understand the girls were not in uniform at the time of the incident and that the suspects asked them 'Are you in the Army?' before issuing the threats.'","The men shouted threats as they drove past the teens leaving the centre .

"Christian Candy, pictured with wife Emily, has upset his neighbours by buying a stretch of road next to his £200million mansion to make room for a garden . Property tycoon Christian Candy has upset his soon-to-be neighbours by buying a stretch of road next to his £200million mansion to make room for a private garden. Mr Candy, who already has planning permission to convert a row of offices into a 15-bedroom home on an exclusive street in central London, caused a stir after purchasing a lease on a 200ft section of road and pavement from the Crown Estate for £3million. Furious residents say the latest plans, which will see a garden built next to the house on Cambridge Terrance and Chester Gate, next to Regent's Park, will cause more than two years of disruption. The Chester Terrace Residents' Association - representing 40 homes on the Grade 1 listed row of family homes - says the work will disrupt traffic and endanger pedestrians. A spokeswoman told the Evening Standard: 'We had a meeting with Crown Estate and they said there would be hoardings in the road for more than two years while the work was ongoing. 'Then we were told about the garden proposals and it would only be for private use by Christian Candy. All the other gardens around here are for communal use and this would be the largest private garden near here.' Mr Candy's neighbours will be consulted before any decisions on the plans are made by Camden Council and the Crown Estate Paving Commission. The tycoon, 39, bought the block of large homes - London's second largest private residence after Buckingham Palace - last year. The home will have 35 bathrooms alone, as well as a private rooftop garden with a sliding glass roof. The seven Regency houses, including numbers one and two Chester Gate and numbers six to 10 Cambridge Terrace, were designed by John Nash - the architect of Buckingham Palace. Mr Candy's plans would see a private garden built next to the 15-bedroom mansion (right) next to Regent's Park, London, extending out onto one lane of road . The tycoon, 39, bought the block of seven homes (pictured) - London's second largest private residence after Buckingham Palace - last year . They were constructed in 1826 but were damaged by bombs in WWII and a subsequent fire in 1947, before being restored with replica Nash facades in the 1980s. A spokesman for Mr Candy's company CPC said the stretch of road was originally a private garden. He said: 'The garden was subsequently removed to make way for an extra lane of traffic and for a period was two way. The road is now reverted to a one-way street. 'It seems proper and fitting to replace the second lane of tarmac and to reinstate the garden. This would, with the other private gardens which feature throughout the Nash Terraces, restore Nash's original design.'","Property tycoon plans to build a garden on a road next to his mansion .

"A former girlfriend of George Soros had her civil case against the billionaire businessman thrown out after a sudden outburst in court on Thursday. Adriana Ferreyr, 31, had filed a $50million lawsuit against the 84-year-old after the two split in 2011, saying he had given away a $1.9million apartment promised to her to girlfriend Tamiko Bolton, who is now his wife, and alleging that he also inflicted emotional damage by slapping her during a fight and having his security guards 'stalk' her. The entire suit was dismissed though by Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Debra James after an incident in which Ferreyr 'lunged at her ex-boyfriend’s lawyer during a Manhattan court hearing and angrily snatched away legal papers while yelling.'

The New York Post reports that on Thursday, Ferryr, who is currently representing herself having gone through three sets of lawyers, had been convinced by Judge James to sign 'medical release forms related to injuries she allegedly sustained from Soros.' Almost as soon as she signed them though, she had a sudden change of heart. According to a witness, she lunged at Soros' lawyer, Andrew Brettler, and 'aggressively' snatched the folder from him. 'She got angry' said a source. 'At one point she blurted out, ""They’re going to get the information and reveal it to the press to embarrass me.""'

"A love-sick Turkish stowaway froze to death after sneaking on board a passenger jet to fly to the UK to see his girlfriend. Hikmet Komur was exposed to temperatures as low as -60C after climbing into the landing gear bay of a British Airways jet before it left Istanbul in July, 2013. The 32-year-old could not afford to pay for the fare to see his girlfriend, Luisa de Silva, who lives in the west London, an inquest into his death has heard. Turkish Hikmet Komur died after stowing himself in the undercarriage of a British Airways flight to Heathrow so that he could be with his girlfriend, Luisa de Silva (pictured together above) Mr Komur's lifeless body was found by British Airways staff at Heathrow Airport after the four hour flight. West London Coroner's Court heard how the divorced father suffered fatal brain damage after being exposed to subzero temperatures in the air. Just two months before his death, Ms de Silva, whom he had known 'for many years', visited the man in Turkey. He begged her to move to Istanbul to be with him, but she refused. 'Once he said he had no money, so I was sending money, £50 or £60,' a distressed Ms de Silva told the inquest. 'He said he was going to get a visa and come here. Then he sent me a picture of his passport. I knew it was not real.' Shortly before making the journey, Mr Komur is understood to have emailed the woman to tell him he loved her. Weeping, Ms de Silva, who lives in west London, added: 'I tried to stop him but I couldn't do anything.' The divorced father told Ms de Silva he would travel to the UK after obtaining a passport in the weeks before his death . Mr Komur died after being exposed to temperatures as low as -60C on board the aircraft. At an inquest into his death, his girlfriend (pictured with him, left) told how she sent him money from Britain . A British Airways statement revealed Mr Komur was discovered when a manager saw 'what he believed to be a human foot and some cloth hanging out of the landing gear cover'. Inside the compartment they found Mr Komur, who had been wearing a woolen hat and with white socks over his hands. Ms de Silva told the inquest she tried to stop him from visiting the UK . Later, aviation security advisor Nick Gould said: 'It’s believed that he intended to visit his girlfriend into the UK.' Kazim Komur, Mr Komur's brother who lives in London, said he had not seen him for more than 15 years when he was given news of his death. 'He had some family problems with his mother, with his siblings. 'My brother was an adventurer.' Recording an accidental death, Coroner Jeremy Chipperfield said: 'It's clear that Hikmet Komur in the past demonstrated an intention to work, to come to the UK, to be with his friend Luisa de Silva, who was a close friend and with whom he wanted to continue some kind of relationship. 'It’s very likely that he intended to come to the UK by stowing himself in an undercarriage of BA675 from Istanbul. 'It’s unclear how he got into that wheel bay but the evidences strongly suggests that it was voluntary. My conclusion is that this was an accidental death.' He added that the medical cause of death was cerebral hypoxia, where the brain becomes severely damaged due lack of oxygen. Addressing the victim’s brother, Mr Chipperfield added: 'Mr Komur, I’m very very sorry for your loss. 'It must be distressing and difficult to come to court and listen to these things.'

"In a galaxy not so far away, a French inventor has created a replica of Han Solo’s famous spaceship, the Millennium Falcon. The amazing contraption is seen hovering and flying around the ground, complete with the aesthetics and lights inspired by the famous Star Wars ship. It is built around a standard quadcopter drone, which has been boosted to give the Millennium Falcon drone more speed. Scroll down for videos . A French inventor has unveiled a Star Wars-inspired quadcopter (shown). The Millennium Falcon drone is seen taking off and flying around. It has lights on the back to mimic famous spaceship. And it also has a shell and design that matches the original. The drone itself cost about £750, but the modifications were under £20 . Olivier Caron, 40, who goes by Olivier-FR on Reddit and is from Grenoble in France, said that he ‘overpowered’ the quadcopter drone to make it ‘easily capable of 90 km/h (55mph) speed’. Rumours suggest that the California-based firm is looking to release a range of multirotor helicopters late in 2015. The devices would be fitted with GoPro cameras, controlled remotely and are expected to retail for between $500 (£317) and $1,000 (£634). At this price range, the drones would be targeted more towards consumers and hobbyists and compete with market leaders Parrot and DJI, rather than rival the likes of professional devices from senseFly. He added: ‘But with this extra hull it becomes a slow flying pig. ‘Top speed is probably around 30 km/h (19mph), if I try to go faster with more angle it’s making a cool backflip.’ He joked that it could make the ‘Kessel run’ in several thousand years, in reference to Han Solo’s boasting in Star Wars: A New Hope, when he said the Millennium Falcon could make the ‘Kessel run’ - a smuggling route - in ‘less than twelve parsecs’. Olivier said it cost him next to nothing to modify the drone into a new shape. It cost £7.50 ($11.50) for the two foam planks to make the drone, and £9 ($13.80) for the front and rear lights.

"Thousands of holidaymakers are returning from the Caribbean with the same debilitating and potentially deadly mosquito-borne virus that actress Lindsay Lohan contracted this winter, . An unprecedented outbreak of the Chikungunya virus continues to affect islands including Barbados, St Lucia and the Grenadines, where many travelers flock during the cold season. The disease, which causes severe, often disabling joint pain, leaves its victims bedridden for days. Some have reported feeling its effects for years, while its more vulnerable victims have died. Although trials of an anti-viral drug  have had positive results,  there is currently no vaccine for the bug commercially available. And worryingly, few US doctors are prepared to recognize its signs. Scroll down for video .

Above, Lohan posted this picture online during her vacation . Mosquito-borne: The disease, which causes severe, often disabling joint pain, is spread by mosquitoes (file picture). Some victims have reported feeling its effects for years, while its more vulnerable victims have died . Last month, Lohan was hospitalized at King Edward VII's Hospital in London after contracting the virus while on a break in French Polynesia over the Christmas holiday, TMZ reported at the time. Despite her illness, the 28-year-old Mean Girls star has since been seen out and about. On Thursday, she was pictured jetting of Los Angeles, California, following a brief filming and promotional visit. At the time she fell ill with the virus, Lohan took to Instagram and Twitter to express her determination to not let the bug ruin her holiday, saying: 'I refuse to let a virus effect my peaceful vacation (sic).' The actress, who also starred in The Parent Trap, later posted a snap of herself jet skiing in a bikini, with the caption: 'Before I got Chikungunya. Use big spray please. God bless'. Since it spread from Asia and Africa in late 2013, Chikungunya has infected a million people in the Caribbean, Latin America and parts of South America and Mexico. In the U.S. alone, more than 2,300 travelers since last May have brought home the virus, which has nothing to do with chickens. About a dozen people have gotten it from mosquito bites in Florida.

Above, the luxurious villa the Alohilani, where Lohan stayed during her break . The virus can cause fever, a rash, headache and joint pain (mostly in the arms and legs) that can lasts for years.  Symptoms typically start three to seven days after the mosquito bite. Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. Symptoms include a fever, headaches, rashes and joint pain. After being bitten the onset of illness occurs usually between four and eight days, but can range from two to 12. There is no vaccine or cure and treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. Most patients recover fully but in some cases joint pain may persist for several months or even years. Serious complications are not common, but in older people, the disease can contribute to the cause of death. The disease was first described during an outbreak in Tanzania in 1952. Since then, it has spread to nearly 40 countries in Asia, Africa, the Americas and Europe. Source: World Health Organisation . At one New York hospital, a woman arrived in such agony she had to be admitted just to control her pain. 'Thinks she has chicken virus??'  staff wrote on the medical chart after speaking to her. Another victim, Marisa Hargrove, arrived at a Miami emergency room after suffering from joint pain so bad her husband was forced to help her to the bathroom. A doctor ran tests for common illnesses 'and basically called me his mystery case of the day,' she said. Back home and getting sicker, Mrs Hargrove searched her symptoms on the Internet. She then returned to the emergency room and asked: 'Is it possible it's this new chikungunya?'. 'The doctor looked at me like I was crazy and said, ""What the heck is that?"",' she said. A blood test confirmed she had it, and the 42-year-old Miami woman became one of the first Americans to have caught chikungunya from local mosquitoes. State health officials say at least 11 people have been infected in Florida, and they worry the virus will become established there. Amd Florida is not the only state at risk . The mosquitoes that spread chikungunya live throughout the South, West and Eastern seaboard of the U.S. Local mosquitoes that bite a traveler infected with the virus can pass it by biting others. Another victim: Marisa Hargrove (pictured) arrived at a Miami emergency room after suffering from joint pain so bad her husband was forced to help her to the bathroom. She was later diagnosed with the virus . Outbreak: The unprecedented outbreak of the Chikungunya virus continues to affect islands including Barbados (pictured, Mullins Beach) and St Lucia, where many travelers flock during the cold season . 'We're very concerned' about travelers because Tennessee has the mosquitoes and climate to let the disease take hold, Abelardo Moncayo of that state's Department of Health told an audience at an American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene conference in New Orleans in November. 'Anywhere that's warm and humid and can sustain mosquitoes year round. So Florida, Texas, any of those Southern states, it could happen,' added Stephen Higgs, a Kansas State University infectious disease expert and an editor of a scientific journal on mosquito-spread diseases. Raising awareness: Mrs Hargrove holds a pamphlet that health workers distributed in her neighborhood after she contracted the Chikungunya virus . Outbreaks spread by locally infected mosquitoes have occurred in Italy and France, and one type of mosquito that can carry chikungunya recently was found in the United Kingdom. 'You can't be reinfected, at least as far as we know,' but there is no vaccine, Higgs said. There also is little treatment besides medicine for pain. 'It can be very bad and can last for a long time, sometimes even for years,' said Dr. Jacques Simkins, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. He treated Mrs Hargrove once her illness was finally diagnosed last July. 'The symptoms come and go,' she said. 'Even today I still get pains in my ankles, my knees, my fingers but it's very transient. You never know when it's going to happen.' Dr. Mindy Brittner, a doctor at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, treated the 60-year-old woman who stumped the emergency room with her talk of 'chicken virus'. 'She came in with fever and terrible muscle and joint pain,'  Brittner, who presented the case at the tropical disease conference, said of the woman, who had visited the Dominican Republic. Anyone who is traveling to the Caribbean or one of the two dozen countries where chikungunya is a risk is advised to use bug repellent with plenty of the active ingredient, such as DEET. They should also keep their arms and legs covered, and be alert for symptoms upon their return.","Outbreak of Chikungunya virus continues to affect parts of Caribbean .

"Volcanoes lurking hidden under the world's oceans may play a far greater role in climate change than previously thought, according to a new study. Scientists have found that underwater volcanoes, which were long assumed to ooze lava at relatively steady rates, in fact erupt in pulses. A new study has shown that these submarine eruptions follow regular cycles that can range from just a couple of weeks to 100,000 years. Scroll down to see a video of an underwater volcano erupting . Eruptions from underwater volcanoes, like this one in 2013 that formed a new island off the coast of Nishinoshhima in Japan, appear to wax and wane with changes in the Earth's orbit around the sun . The researchers claim these eruptions appear to be linked to changes in the Earth's orbit that occur over time. One of the most intriguing findings by the new study of underwater volcanic eruptions is that they appear to follow a seasonal pattern. Data collected by Dr Maya Tolstoy from Columbia University showed that almost all undersea eruptions recorded in the past 25 years occur in the first six months of the year. This may be because January is the month when the Earth is closest to the sun and July is when it is at it's farthest, creating slight squeezing and unsqueezing as it moves. This may be similar to the effect that Dr Tolstoy detected on longer timescales as the shape of the Earth's orbit changes. There may also be some affect caused by changes in sea level as water trapped in the ice around the Arctic and then melts. Dr Tolstoy said: 'If you look at the present-day eruptions, volcanoes respond even to much smaller forces than the ones that might drive climate.' Surprisingly the researchers also found that these eruptions also appear to be clustered during the first six months of each year. The findings may now mean that models predicting how human activity will change the climate will need to be adjusted. Volcanic eruptions are known to throw huge amounts of gas into the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide that are thought to increase global warming. However, volcanoes also release aerosol gases that are now known to reduce global warming by creating a reflective barrier against the sun. Dr Maya Tolstoy, a marine geophysicist at the Lamond-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, said: 'People have ignored seafloor volcanoes on the idea that their influence is small, but that’s because they are assumed to be in a steady state, which they’re not. 'They respond to both very large forces, and to very small ones, and that tells us that we need to look at them much more closely.' Underwater volcanoes are known to be widespread on the floor of the world's oceans at joins in the tectonic plates. Most are located in the deep ocean, where their activity can be difficult to measure, although some in shallow water can erupt with enough lava to create new islands. Others erupt with explosive results. In 2009 huge plumes of smoke rose from the sea about 34 miles off the coast of Tonga's capital Nuku'alofa when a volcano there erupted. Underwater volcanoes, however, are known to behave much differently from those on the land. The presence of water quickly cools the emerging lava to create volcanic glass and pillow like structures. Lava from underwater eruptions behaves in different ways than on land, creating pillow shapes shown above . This eruption in 2009 34 miles off the coast of Tonga threw huge amounts of smoke and gas into the air . In the deep ocean, the high pressures there mean the surrounding water do not boil and instead forms supercritical fluids. In some cases hydrothermal vents that spew clouds of sulphur and soot under water appear, known as black smokers. The new research by Dr Tolstoy, which is published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, found that the undersea volcanoes, which mainly appear along the growing edges of the tectonic plates beneath the ocean, are currently in a relatively weak phase. She believes that despite this they may produce maybe eight times more lava than volcanoes on land but similar levels of carbon dioxide - about 88 million metric tons a year. However, she warns that as the cycle of undersea eruptions change, this could mean more of this gas being produced. Dr Tolstoy and her colleagues monitored 10 submarine eruptions using seismic instruments placed on the sea floor. They also used underwater mapping to produce high-resolution maps providing evidence of past lava flows and analysed seismic data from the ocean ridges in the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic oceans. She found that during the coldest periods when ice ages occur, undersea volcanism seems to surge, producing visible bands of hills. Dr Tolstoy used maps of ocean ridges like this one to study lava eruptions from up to 700,000 years ago . This, she says, is because sea levels drop as water becomes locked up on the land in glaciers, relieving pressure on the undersea volcanoes and allowing them to erupt more often. Changes in the gravitational pull on the Earth as it orbits the sun is also thought to influence these eruptions. The planet gets squeezed and squashed as it travels on its elliptical orbit around the solar system. Over time the Earth's orbit changes shape, altering the pressure placed on the tectonic plates and so the rate of eruptions. These changes in the rate of eruption can occur over hundreds of thousands of years. Dr Tolstoy said similar affects can also be seen in shorter time frames due to the gravitational pull of the moon, causing undersea volcanoes to pulse into life roughly every two weeks. She found that seismic signals that indicated eruptions coincided with fortnightly low tides in eight out of nine study sites. Daniel Fornari, a senior scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution not involved in the research, said the findings could have important implications for understanding how underwater volcanoes influence the climate. However, he warned that seismic activity could be due to rumbles and cracking on the sea floor and not actual eruptions of lava. Edward Baker, a senior ocean scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, added: 'The most interesting takeaway from this paper is that it provides further evidence that the solid Earth, and the air and water all operate as a single system.'","Geophysicists at Columbia University have found underwater volcanoes erupt in regular cycles that range from a fortnight to 100,000 years .
They claim that volcanoes on the sea floor are currently experiencing a lull .

"Road death: PC Hassan Ali, 44, who was under investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission over the Rotherham scandal, has been killed after being knocked down by a car . A serving police officer linked to the Rotherham child sex scandal has died after being hit by a car as he crossed the street. PC Hassan Ali, 44, was under investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission after it was alleged he twice asked a victim out on a date. Four complaints in total were made against PC Ali to South Yorkshire Police by two members of the public. But PC Ali was fatally injured  after being struck by a car in Darnall, Sheffield at around 10.15pm last Wednesday. He died with his family at his bedside yesterday morning. His death comes just two days after a bombshell report branded Rotherham Council ‘in denial’ over the abuse of up to 2,000 young girls over a 16-year period, predominantly by members of the town’s Pakistani community. Police, who have made no arrests, say they are not treating his death as suspicious and a source said they believe it was a 'tragic accident'. Chief Constable David Crompton, of South Yorkshire Police, said: 'All of our thoughts are with Hassan's family and on behalf of the force I would like to offer my sincere condolences at this incredibly difficult time. 'PC Ali was a well-liked officer whose colleagues are devastated by what has happened.' He was a neighbourhood policing officer based in Rotherham and had been placed on 'restricted duties', while the IPCC assessed whether to launch a full investigation into him. He was one of ten officers from the force referred to the IPCC for their handling of the scandal. One of the complainants, who is now an adult, said PC Ali had first asked her out when she was 17 and then did so again four years later when she was 21. The woman said the officer had been involved with her case and was aware she had been a victim of sustained abuse between the ages of 14 and 17. At the time he first asked her on a date, she had a one-year-old son, who had been born after she was made pregnant by her abuser when she was 15. The woman said the officer's behaviour had been 'inappropriate and totally unprofessional'. Appeal: Police want to speak to witnesses to the collision that fatally injured the police officer in Staniforth Road, Sheffield. It is not being treated as suspicious . She said she told the police of his approaches in August 2013 when she gave a statement about the abuse she had suffered, but she claimed nothing was done to investigate her claims. South Yorkshire Police last month confirmed an officer had been referred to the IPCC. The woman said she had asked the officer when she was a teenager to provide her with a picture of her son's father for his nursery. 'He said I will get you a picture but you are not to tell anyone because I could lose my job,' she said. 'He said he had to go into files that he wasn't authorised to go into. Then he fetched me the picture to my mum and dad's house. He came in and my mum made him a drink. 'I walked out with him and he asked me out on a date. A few years after he asked me out again.' She said she had said no on both occasions. The nature of the other complaints made against him are not known. A police spokesman said: ‘South Yorkshire Police has received four public complaints relating to alleged misconduct of one of our officers. ‘The complaints were made by two separate people about the officer, a PC based in the Rotherham area.’ This afternoon an official Ukip Twitter account said the death of the was 'Karma'. The tweet, which was deleted shortly after being posted this afternoon, read: 'South Yorkshire police says PC Hassan Ali who was under investigation in relation to child abuse in Rotherham has died in a car crash KARMA!'. Ukip blamed volunteers running the page for the tweet. A Ukip said: 'The UKIP Plymouth account is run by a team of volunteers, and it seems the tweet was made by one of them without permission. 'Once it was tweeted it was deleted almost immediately. The content of the tweet does not reflect the views of the branch, its candidates or indeed the wider party. The matter is being investigated.'","PC Hassan Ali has died a week after he was knocked down in Sheffield .

"Researchers have revealed an algorithm they say can spot the 'beauty' in photographs - and what makes a great selfie. Yahoo Labs in Barcelona say their software can spot the best holiday snap, and even analyse your selfies. They say their work could improve the quality of snaps online - and used 10,000 photographic portraits rated by humans to learn what we look for. Scroll down for video . How to take the perfect selfie: Yahoo Labs in Barcelona say their software can spot the best holiday snap, and even analyse your selfies. The key to a good picture, the researchers say, is 'Aesthetic score is related to sharpness of facial landmarks, image contrast, exposure, homogeneity, illumination pattern, uniqueness, and originality. 'race, gender, and age are largely uncorrelated with photographic beauty.' The single most important factor is the sharpness of the image. But other important factors include the contrast between the face and background. 'Digital portrait photographs are everywhere, and while the number of face pictures keeps growing, not much work has been done to on automatic portrait beauty assessment,' the team wrote in the open source journal arxiv. The say the rise of the selfie has meant a huge increase in the number of pictures people take. 'Selfies' have become a phenomenon, and recent studies show that images with faces are more popular (+38% 'likes' on Instagram) than other pictures in online social networks. 'Portraits are also used in web user profiles, in news articles, to represent celebrities and public figures, and they are an essential part of all kinds of IDs.' The researchers found that in fact, the person in the picture is often irrelevant. 'We find that race, gender, and age are largely uncorrelated with photographic beauty,' wrote the researchers, led by . 'Aesthetic score is related to sharpness of facial landmarks, image contrast, exposure, homogeneity, illumination pattern, uniqueness, and originality,' they add. They team say their algorithm is significantly better than other machine-based attempts to recognise beauty and provides some curious insights into the nature of photographic portraiture. 'We find that the beauty of a portrait is linked to its artistic value, and independent from age, race and gender of the subject.' The single most important factor is the sharpness of the image. But other important factors include the contrast between the face and background. Pictures of females also tend to be more memorable, as well as brighter and post-processed, while pictures of males tend to have darker colors - and men smile less than women in portraits. The team's algorithm determines which of these metrics correlated with the human beauty rating to decide how 'beautiful' an image is. They began with a set of 10,000 photographic portraits that have been rated for beauty by humans on a scale from 1 to 10 and annotated with words and phrases that describe each image. The team first analyse each image using face recognition software that determines the age, sex and race of the main subject in each portrait along with the position of the face worked out from the relative coordinates of the eyes, nose and mouth. They then created algorithms that measured how well each image achieved standard photographic techniques of composition, exposure and lighting. These included the arrangement of objects within the image, the distribution of lighting within the image and the sharpness of the picture. They also measured the exposure quality, contrast and jpeg compression along with the contrast between the face and the background. The final step used the human annotations to classify the emotional polarity of each image, whether positive or negative and assessed the originality of the image compared to others. The team's algorithm then  determines which of these metrics correlated with the human beauty rating. The team say their algorithm is far more successful than other attempts to spot good pictures . They say it can do this incredibly successfully. 'We also show that a classifier trained with our features to separate beautiful portraits from non beautiful portraits outperforms generic aesthetic classifiers.' 'In our future work, we plan to broaden our framework by extending our database to include portrait images 'in the wild', exploring portrait aesthetics with a more challenging context,' they said. 'Physical/demographic properties such as gender, eye color, glasses, age, and race show very low correlation with image beauty, suggesting that any subject, no matter his/her traits, can be part of a stunning picture,' conclude Redi and co.","Yahoo Labs says its algorithm can spot the best snaps .

"A man  died 72 hours after suffering crippling headaches when doctors failed to diagnose a deadly infection. Colin Mayes was taken to hospital in Swansea after being struck by the extreme pain as well as numbness, with medics fearing he was suffering a stroke. But after ordering an MRI scan, to check for anything untoward in the brain, doctors failed to check the results of the test. The failure to read the results, attributed to a breakdown in communication, led to the 42-year-old's death just hours later. Mr Mayes was found to have suffered a brain abscess - a pus-filled swelling caused by an infection. Colin Mayes, pictured on his wedding day with wife Christine, died 72 hours after suffering crippling headaches and numbness . The scan, carried out on February 8, 2013, revealed he required urgent treatment. But it wasn't until February 12 - a day after Mr Mayes' death - that doctors realised their error. His wife, Christine, said she has been left devastated by the sudden loss of her husband. She has questioned whether his life could have been saved, had the infection which led to the abscess been picked up straight away. A serious incident report, carried out by the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board, which runs Morriston Hospital, highlighted a lack of communication between medical teams as being the reason for the MRI scan being left unchecked. Mrs Mayes, 50, said: 'It's heartbreaking that I have lost the love of my life in just 72 hours. 'There isn't a second that goes by that I don't think about Colin. 'Our doctor first suggested we go to A&E when Colin started suffering from numbness and headaches - they thought he was having a stroke. 'But when we got to hospital he was given an MRI but no-one checked the scan. 'Colin died just hours later while in hospital, it's shocking. 'We were told a brain abscess is nearly always fatal without treatment but you can survive if they are treated quickly.' The 42-year-old was admitted to Morriston Hospital near Swansea and doctors ordered an MRI  scan . The couple fell in love online in 2010, with Mr Mayes travelling down to Wales from his home in Scotland to meet his wife-to-be for the first time. She said they immediately fell for one another and married the following year. She added: 'He agreed to come and see me in Wales and he never went back. 'We'd already agreed to get married before he came to see me as we just clicked, and we had a big wedding with all of our family and friends there.' Mrs Mayes suffers from severe arthritis and her husband was acting as her full-time career at the time of his death. She said: 'Colin was healthy and active, there were no warning signs that he was severely ill from a brain infection. 'He had been suffering from some headaches and feeling weak and so went to the doctors. I could never imagine he'd go into hospital and not come out. What good is an apology from the hospital when I have lost the man I loved, and the man who loved me? 'We had so much in common, it really felt we were meant to be together, soulmates. 'I thought we'd be together forever. I can't move on with my life now. It stopped the day he died. I'll never look to be in another relationship as Colin was my one true love.' Following legal action, the health board has offered an 'unreserved apology' and has agreed to pay Mrs Mayes bereavement damages to compensate for her loss. A spokesperson for the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said: 'We offer our sincere condolences to Mr Mayes' family for their sad loss, and apologise for the shortcomings in his care. 'A thorough review was carried out and action has been taken to minimise the risk of it happening again. 'The health board has introduced new procedures for reporting urgent or unexpected radiological findings to avoid unnecessary delay. But due to a breakdown in communication, the scan results were not read by doctors. Mr Mayes was found to have had a brain abscess, caused by an infection. His widow Christine, 50, said she is devastated by the sudden loss of her husband . 'ABMU also contributed to the development of new all-Wales guidance by the Welsh Scientific Advisory Committee. 'Other action includes improving inpatient medical cover provision and the supervision of junior trainees out of hours. 'The health board will introduce additional measures during the course of this year.' Solicitor Hayley Collinson, of Neil Hudgell Solicitors, added: 'The errors made in this case are completely unacceptable. There can be no excuse at all for their failings at this hospital, and these failings have come at the ultimate cost. 'For a hospital to carry out an MRI scan on a patient, and then simply fail to follow-up on the results, is beyond shocking. 'Mr Mayes was left with his condition deteriorating over the weekend and without the treatment he needed because medical teams simply failed to communicate with one another about the seriousness of his situation.'","Colin Mayes, 42, was taken to hospital in Swansea in February 2013 .

"Invented by a strict teetotaler, Bovril was once used as a flu treatment and seriously considered as a nourishing alternative to alcohol. Now as it turns 125 years old, the iconic brand - invented by Scotsman John Lawson Johnston in 1873 - has unveiled three limited edition, old-fashioned jars to celebrate the landmark anniversary. Each one has a vintage illustration and old advertising slogans used to sell the 'fluid beef' concocted as a way of feeding soldiers during the Franco-Prussian War. Scroll down for video . Bovril has unveiled three limited edition, old-fashioned-style jars to celebrate its 125th birthday . Retro adverts from the 1920s, 1930s and 1960s give the the jars a nostalgic feel . As Marmite introduces its new 'End Neglect' campaign, Bovril has brought out one of its own - bringing back retro adverts from the 1920s, 1930s and 1960s. The iconic adverts are integral to the history of Bovril - and one of the historic ads with the tag lines 'Bovril prevents that sinking feeling' harks back to a time when the beefy drink was being used by doctors to help treat influenza. One advert is the iconic bull looking at a jar of the meat extract with the caption 'Alas, my poor brother!' and another shows a pyjama-clad man with the caption 'Don't forget the Bovril!' on it. Bovril was invented  after French President Napoleon III ordered one million cans of beef to feed his soldiers during the Franco-Prussian War. Because transporting the beef was so problematic inventor Johnston came up with Bovril as an alternative and it was originally known as 'Johnston's Fluid Beef'. Because Britain didn't have enough beef stocks to fill the millions of kilogram tins the French required, Johnston moved to Canada and founded the company and built a factory in Sherbrooke, Quebec. The iconic bull looking at a jar of the meat extract (left) and Bovril prevents that sinking feeling (right) The historic ad with the tag lines 'Bovril prevents that sinking feeling' harks back to a time when the beefy drink was being used by doctors to help treat influenza . Johnston, who was a strict teetotaller, worked on his invention and saw his 'fluid beef' as a practical alternative to alcohol. By 1884, Johnston's fluid beef became a huge success in Canada and he sold the business to move to London. With only two staff, Johnston set up a small factory and started to produce his fluid beef under a new name - Bovril. In 1888, over 3,000 bars and pubs had started serving Bovril and by a year later, it had a share capital of £150,000. The meat drink became a huge favourite and was regularly shipped off to overseas troops and even Norwegian polar explorers. In 1892 doctors prescribed Bovril for the influenza epidemic. The meat extract is  popular among football fans, who enjoy the drink on chilly days while watching the game . By 1900, advertising for Bovril had reached as far as Africa and South America and by 1909, Bovril had land in Argentina and Australia. In the late 20th century it became immensely popular when enough of it was sold to make over 90 million mugs of it. The meat extract is now extremely popular among football fans, who enjoy the drink on chilly days while watching the game. Laura Grant, from Bovril, said: 'Bovril is a truly British brand that has stood the test of time, so it's great to pay tribute to its heritage through these three limited edition jars. 'We hope Bovril fans of all ages will enjoy this retrospective look at the brand they know and love, while enjoying the same, classic taste of beef Bovril.'","The drink was invention of Scotsman John Lawson Johnston in 1873 .

"What does Douglas Durst, the wealthy chairman of a multibillion-dollar family empire the Durst Organization fear most? His own potentially psychopathic brother, revealed the New York real estate heir. Douglas Durst claims that Robert Durst would kill him if he had the chance. Robert Durst has been charged with murder once and has been linked to two other murders over the past 30 years but has never once been convicted. Scroll down for video . Fears for his life: 'Given the opportunity, he would kill me, yes,' Douglas Durst, the wealthy chairman of a multibillion-dollar family empire the Durst Organization said of his brother Robert . Accused murderer: Real estate heir Robert Durst appears in a criminal courtroom for his trial on charges of trespassing on property owned by his estranged family back in 2014 . 'Given the opportunity, he would kill me, yes,' Douglas Durst told the New York Post. 'If that makes me a pussy, then I’m a pussy,’ he said in a rare personal interview. In the 'The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,’ a six part documentary to air on HBO on Sunday created by Andrew Jarecki, Robert Durst calls his brother Douglas a pussy for hiring a body guard. Jarecki told a Hollywood version of Durst's story in the 2010 film that starred Ryan Gosling, 'All Good Things.' A week before the film's release, Durst called and said he wanted to see it. Apparently impressed, Durst agreed to be interviewed about his life by Jarecki and partner Marc Smerling. Robert also claims in the documentary that he believes his brother was unfairly made the head of the family's real estate empire in 1994 because he was the 'favorite brother.' Filmmaker: Filmmaker Andrew Jarecki attends the HBO documentary series premiere of 'The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst' at the Time Warner Building in New York . Threatening: Robert Durst, pictured in 2014, who was questioned about but never charged with several mysterious deaths and disappearances, is accused of violating the terms of his brother's restraining order . Douglas told The New York Post hat his brother Robert was employed with the family company but lost his job when he peed in his uncle's wastebasket. 'I came back from vacation and I was putting my hand into the wastepaper basket and it was covered by liquid. It was urine,' said Douglas. 'It was I who asked the staff, and they said my brother did it frequently. When he urinated into my uncle’s basket they [company officials] took action.' In July of 2014 Robert Durst was arrested for urinating over over $100 worth of candy at the register in a Houston drugstore. Robert Durst has been accused of far worse things than peeing in a waste basket and in a pharmacy, however. Robert was accused of killing his first wife Kathleen McCormack and her friend Susan Berman. Kathleen  disappeared in 1982 and the case remained unsolved for 18 years. In December 2000, Kathleen's friend Susan Berman thought to have knowledge about Kathleen's disappearance was found murdered execution style in her California house. Robert admitted to killing and dismembering his neighbor Morris Black in Galveson, Texas in 2001 while he posed as a deaf mute woman. In September 2001, remnants of the body of Morris Black - Dust’s next-door neighbour from the boarding house he was living in at the time, were found floating in the Galveston Bay in Galveston, Texas. Gone without a trace: Robert's first wife Kathleen disappeared in 1982 without a trace and while Robert was suspected in her murder he was never convicted . A trail of blood led police back to Dust’s apartment, which was actually rented to a reportedly odd and mute woman, named Dorothy Ciner. The big surprise? Ciner was just Durst in a dress. Durst had gone into hiding for years, partially to escape the increasing inquiries about the death of his wife. After spending about a month on the run, Durst attempted to steal a chicken salad sandwich and a single a Band-Aid from a supermarket in Philadelphia, and was subsequently arrested. He was described as wearing a brown wig and a fake blond mustache. Amazingly, Durst was acquitted in 2003 for the murder, using a self-defense plea, and a charge of 'tampering with evidence' over the disposal of the body. He was sentenced to five years behind bars but served only one. In the documentary, the accused murderer and rumored psychopath Robert Durst details his difficult childhood. He said his father Seymour was cold and distant and that he was seven-years-old his father brought him to the window of their home to have him wave at 'mommy in her nightie' who was standing on a roof as later plunged to her death. Douglas told The New York Post that what his Robert said about their father was false. 'What he says is untrue,' said Douglas. 'My father loved him. Actually, he was my father’s favorite. He has no relationship to either the truth or emotions.' Murdered: In December 2000, Kathleen's friend Susan Berman thought to have knowledge about Kathleen's disappearance was found murdered execution style in her California house . Douglas claims that Robert was not at the family house when their mother died but he was at a neighbor's house with him and two other siblings. Douglas told the Post that his mother suffered from emphysema and that medication she took made her unaware of her surroundings. It's unknown as to whether she fell off the roof or jumped accidentally. Douglas says he has only seen snippets of the documentary and doesn't approve of filmmakers giving his brother a 'megaphone' In 2006 other Durst family members paid Robert $65 million to relinquish claims to the family fortune. Robert has allegedly threatened his brother Douglas on numerous occasions, reports The Post. In 2003 Robert drove his car into the driveway of Douglas' Westchester house where he sat with two guns and he later drove off. In 2008 he returned wearing a ski mask. Relatives have 13 orders of protection against Robert and he was acquitted in a number of trespassing charges. The poisonous relationship between Robert Durst and his younger brother, Douglas, plays out both in the film and in its offscreen preparations. Confessed: Robert admitted to killing and dismembering his neighbor Morris Black in Galveson, Texas in 2001 while he posed as a deaf mute woman but his murder charge was acquitted . Jarecki said he tried multiple times to interview Douglas for 'The Jinx,' but was turned down. Through his lawyer, Charles Moerdler, Douglas wouldn't talk with The Associated Press. In an interview that ran in The New York Times on Jan. 1, Douglas Durst said he was concerned the film gives his brother 'a megaphone to spout his lies and his distortions about my father, about his relationship to the family and about the family's history.' Moerdler said Douglas wouldn't be interviewed for the film because Jarecki would not show him his work in advance. The lawyer said he believes that Jarecki drew from deposition material that was supposed to be kept confidential; Jarecki said there's nothing in the film he and HBO could not support legally. 'As much as Doug Durst would like people to think we're making a propaganda piece, I think the reason that he's upset is because we're not,' he said. Durst's tale begins unspooling Sunday (8 p.m. EST) on HBO and continues for five more weekly episodes. More than a murder mystery, the absorbing series reveals a strange but smart man who's long feuded with his wealthy family. 'The story is so operatic,' Jarecki said. 'That's what's so fascinating to me — seeing someone who is born to such privilege and years later is living in a $300-a-month rooming house in Galveston, Texas, disguised as a mute woman.'","Douglas Durst, the wealthy chairman of a multibillion-dollar family empire the Durst Organization fears his brother Robert Durst will try to kill him .

"Crowded trains, congested roads and signal failures often causes commuter journeys to take far longer than they should. But some parts of the US are far more willing to put up with a long commute than others, and this fascinating interactive map reveals the divide. It shows how the eastern states have some of the longest journey times to work, while parts of the south west and mid-west boast the shortest commuter times. Scroll down for video . The average commute time of workers in Monroe County, Florida is 18.8 minutes. The map shows how this compares to the rest of the United States. Most places, particularly in the east, have a longer commute, as indicated by the brown and darker brown shades . Created by Nathan Yau at Flowing Data, you can click on each county on the map - which can be viewed here - to see the average commute times for workers. Counties coloured green have a lower average commute time, and brown means a longer average commute time. Grey, meanwhile, shows commute times that are about the same. 'My wife grew up where hour-long commutes are normal. Her dad used to leave at 4:00am to beat the morning rush and then nap in the parking lot until work started,' California-based Mr Yau wrote on his site. It seems much of the US has a much shorter commute (in green and dark green) than the  185,000 residents of Hawaii County (shown in black) who take an average of 25 minutes and four seconds to get to work each day . Thomas county in Nebraska, which has a population of around 650 people, has an average commute time of 16 minutes and 30 seconds. This is equal large areas of the rest of the US (shown in grey), however, the eastern states seem to be willing to put up with longer journeys . Your commute is likely costing you much more than you realise, according to recent research. This in driving-related expenses, in number of hours on the road and in negative health outcomes, scientist claim. In fact, 10.8 million Americans travel more than an hour each way to work. And 600,000 endure 'megacommutes' of at least 90 minutes and 50 miles each way. The Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index has found that the longer the commute, the higher the levels of one's obesity, cholesterol, pain, fatigue and anxiety. The costs of commuting disproportionately hit those with modest incomes. For the working poor, commuting took up roughly 6 perc ent of income - double the percentage of those bringing home higher salaries.

"As he hugs his newborn son in a £40,000 bespoke nursery, Daryl Lee has realised his dream of becoming a father for the first time. He gazes at his civil partner Luke Harris, then they turn to the child’s surrogate mother, Bex Harris, and say: ‘Thank you for giving us the baby we’ve always dreamed of.’ Phoenix Blue Harris-Lee, nicknamed ‘little master Blue’ by the couple, was born naturally at 11.01pm on January 14 after a 16-hour induced labour, weighing 7lb 15oz. Biologically, 41-year-old Mr Lee is the father and Bex – no relation to Luke – used her own eggs, as a traditional surrogate. But Bex isn’t the only woman to be giving birth for the gay couple, who live in an £800,000 four-bedroomed home in Surrey. Scroll down for video . Surrogate mother Bex Harris holds baby Phoenix surrounded by fellow surrogate Viktoria Ellis, left, father Luke Harris, is partner Daryl Lee and third surrogate Becky Harris . In their quest for a family, Mr Harris and Mr Lee have controversially enlisted the help of not one but three surrogates. All three became pregnant within weeks of each other – meaning that two more babies are on the way. The second, a girl, who is biologically Mr Harris’s child, is due to be born on February 23 to first-time surrogate Viktoria Ellis from Glemsford, Suffolk. A third baby, a boy, who also is biologically Mr Lee’s, is due on July 14 to Bex’s sister-in-law Becky Harris – who, remarkably, is also Viktoria’s neighbour. Last night IT consultant Mr Harris, 50, said: ‘We are overwhelmed and overjoyed that we’ve become dads as we’ve longed for a family for more than a decade. It’s something we never thought would be possible. ‘Yes, our family is unconventional, but just because we are gay shouldn’t preclude us from becoming parents. Our home is a loving, nurturing environment and between us we have three sisters and our parents so there will be plenty of positive female role models for our children as they grow up. I suppose you could say we are a very modern family.’ Mr Lee, a dentist, and Mr Harris met on the internet in January 1999 and moved in together that year. In 2012 they became civil partners. They had often talked about wanting children and originally intended to try to adopt. But after reading about Sir Elton John and his partner David Furnish becoming parents to a boy through surrogacy in 2010, they decided to follow his example. The mothers were introduced to the gay couple after they joined several surrogacy websites and forums. Initially, they chatted for 12 months to Becky, 27, from Suffolk. The happy couple Mr Harris and Mr Lee controversially enlisted the help of not one but three surrogates . Because she was already helping a couple, she introduced them to her former sister-in-law Bex, 32, who had been a surrogate once before. Six weeks later, when she knew they longed for a family, Bex told them that her best friend Viktoria, 32, was looking to become a first-time surrogate. After four months of meetings, both women agreed to become their surrogate mothers. In an even more bizarre twist, Becky also came back to the dads and offered to make it a hat-trick for them – and a world first for surrogacy. Each of the women is a traditional surrogate, meaning they use their own eggs – so while babies one and three will be half brothers, baby two will not be genetically linked to them. Surrogate mother Bex holds baby boy Phoenix Blue after the birth last month . Mr Harris said: ‘We never set out to become a world first, we just wanted children of our own. But because Bex and Becky are former sisters-in-law they are really close and they both used to live on the same street as Viktoria, so it’s like we are a huge extended family. ‘They’ve been nicknamed the “twiplets” as they will all go to school at the same time together. After sitting down and talking it through we knew in our hearts that we couldn’t turn down the chance to have the family we’d always dreamed of.’ For the birth, Bex’s mother Karen drove her to the NHS hospital and they met Mr Harris and Mr Lee at the entrance. Bex said: ‘I spent hour after hour in the early stages of labour, which was exhausting. Then I started to feel a lot of pressure and I knew the baby was on its way. I just started breathing deeply and focusing on the job in hand but the pain was awful. ‘As soon as I was taken into the delivery suite my mum Karen, who is known as “mamma stork” as she’s my and the two other surrogates’ birthing partner, and the dads encouraged me. ‘Daryl held my hand throughout the whole thing. I had my eyes shut tight as the pain was so intense. It was too late to give me an epidural so I had to do it with gas and air alone. ‘There was a lot of commotion and I started crying with the joy of it all. ‘Daryl cut the cord and the baby was handed straight to Luke for skin on skin [contact]. It was a beautiful moment. I just felt so elated I’d done this for them and had given them the son they’d always dreamed of.’ Mr Lee said: ‘During the birth we could see his little heart racing so we were worried about him. Then, when he popped out, he was so delightful. Ten perfect little fingers and toes and a pretty good pair of lungs. ‘As soon as he was in Luke’s arms he stared up at him and immediately became calm. It was so overwhelming I couldn’t hold back my tears. I felt a rush of love for my son. He grimaced a bit but he was delightful. It was a beautiful, wonderful moment to hold our child in our arms.’ Birth: Bex was introduced to the gay couple after they joined several surrogacy websites and forums . All three women became pregnant within weeks of each other – meaning that two more babies are on the way . Within hours of the birth Mr Lee gave Bex a ‘push present’ – a £200 Swarovski crystal necklace, saying: ‘This is from Luke and I to thank you.’ In law, surrogates are not allowed to be paid but can claim expenses up to £15,000. Mr Harris said: ‘Surrogates always seem to say they don’t form a bond and have no difficulty when the moment comes to hand them over, but we found it hard to say goodbye. ‘Bex obviously feels love for this little mite even though she knows he’s our little boy – she’d even chosen his name, telling us, “As you’re gay you need something really out there”. ‘But she and our other surrogate mums are going to be very much a part of our babies’ lives. We are constantly visiting each other and that’s going to continue.’ Bex, who has spent two weekends with Phoenix and the dads since the birth, said: ‘As I handed him over to say goodbye I just felt physically empty as he wasn’t in my stomach keeping me warm any more. I’d carried him for nine months for Luke and Daryl and I never lost sight of that and I did it as I knew they’d make wonderful dads. ‘Over the past three weeks my initial maternal instinct has cooled. Now when I look at Phoenix I think of him as being my nephew. He doesn’t feel like my child at all. I had nine months to reconcile in my mind that he isn’t mine.’ Once Phoenix is six weeks old, Mr Lee and Mr Harris will apply for a Parental Order through the Family Courts which will give them joint custody . The dads and Bex all went together to register the birth and Mr Lee and Bex’s names are on the birth certificate. Once Phoenix is six weeks old, Mr Lee and Mr Harris will apply for a Parental Order through the Family Courts which will give them joint custody. Once signed, the order means Bex will have no legal responsibility over Phoenix and the dads can apply, if they choose, for a new birth certificate to be issued. They haven’t decided if they will do that yet. For now Mr Harris, a computer programmer and the son of a journalist father and book keeper mother, and Mr Lee are ‘exhausted’ but enjoying every part of fatherhood. They have spent thousands in preparation, including the loft extension, painted in Farrow and Ball paint with Disney-themed blinds featuring the characters from Cars and Bambi. Hand-painted elephants decorate the walls. Their Honda Jazz car has been replaced by a £20,000 Volkswagen Touran people carrier, a custom hand-built wardrobe is half full of blue clothes and half of pink for the impending arrivals, and a £700 iCandy Apple 2 Pear buggy stands in the hall – for now, the dads prefer to use their £100 Babybjorn sling. They continue to work part time, with one dad staying at home on the days the other works. Mr Lee’s parents are going to live with them for the next six months to be on hand while they get the babies into a routine. Mr Harris said: ‘Phoenix is up three times in the night normally and whoever isn’t working the next day does the night-time feeds. He has just slotted into our relationship, he’s another piece in the jigsaw. We were two and now we are three and it feels so natural. ‘Our neighbours have all been over to meet him, and while they are all interested in surrogacy, they have all given us incredible support.’ And for now Bex is delighted to be very much a part of their lives.","Gay couple Daryl Lee and Luke Harris enlisted help of 3 surrogate mothers .

"A state of emergency has been declared in the Galápagos Islands after a ship ran aground nearby last week. The ship, called the Floreana, had been carrying food and other supplies - including some potentially polluting liquids and 45,000 litres (10,000 gallons) of fuel. For now the ship remains in one piece, but officials are working to remove its fuel in case it splits and spills into the surrounding waters. The Floreana ran aground in the Galápagos Islands on Wednesday 28 January, and remains stuck. It had 13,000 gallons of fuel and other hazardous cargo on board. Officials are working to secure the ship so it does not spill into the surrounding waters . Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, some scientists warned there could be some impact on the area if the ship broke apart. 'Naufragio is a bay with great biological diversity,' Dr Carlos Valle, a professor at Universidad San Francisco de Quito, told the Wall Street Journal. 'There is a potential risk of its being affected, especially for very large colonies of sea lions and invertebrate species from the coast.' - 10,000 gallons of fuel . - 11 tons of gear oil . - 103 gas cylinders . - 48 tons of asphalt emulsion . Total: 1,925 tons of cargo . Source: Galapagos Digital . Officials were keen to downplay the risk of danger to the surrounding area, saying that the 'greatest danger has passed.' Nonetheless, they are still in the process of removing all the fuel from the ship, with about 12 per cent still left on board. Ecuador declared the state of emergency on Wedesnday, and the alert 'will allow authorities to have immediate (financial) means to deal with the situation,' a Galapagos National Park spokesman told AFP. This was amid fears the boat poses an imminent risk to the fragile ecosystem of the Unesco World Heritage Site. Ecuador declared the state of emergency on Wedesnday, and the alert 'will allow authorities to have immediate (financial) means to deal with the situation,' a Galapagos National Park spokesman told AFP . Located some 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) off Ecuador's Pacific coast, the Galapagos are famed for the large number of species that have developed there in isolation, such as giant tortoises (shown) On January 28, the ship Floreana, which runs supplies to the Galapagos, ran aground at Puerto Baquerizo Moreno. It was carrying 1,400 tons of cargo, including food and hazardous substances, as well as some 10,000 gallons (45,000 litres) of fuel. There has been some leakage into the pristine waters but that has been controlled by booms. Meanwhile the ship, whose hull was destroyed, is in the process of being refloated and removed. It is at least the third such incident in the past year at the islands.

"The words 'halfbreed' and 'breed' are offensive and should be removed from the names of creeks and other places in Montana, a state lawmaker said. Republican Rep Nicholas Schwaderer introduced a bill yesterday that would require state and other agencies to strip the terms from maps, signs and markers when 'wear or vandalism' make a replacement necessary. The idea for the latest measure came out of work with members of the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians. Offensive: A Montana lawmaker has introduced a bill to remove 'half-breed' and 'breed' from place names in the state. More than 757 places in the US used the term 'Negro' in their names in 2012 (file photo) The Montana bill would also create a volunteer advisory group to determine replacement names. Halfbreed Lake National Wildlife Refuge is the most prominent of 17 places throughout Montana with the word 'half-breed' or 'breed' in the name, according to Nicholas Vrooman, a historian who works with the Little Shell Tribe. Similar measures have passed elsewhere across the US, though the federal government outlaws only two types of place names. The US Board on Geographic Names is the government body that approves all names on maps put out by federal agencies, including the US Geological Survey and the US Army Corps of Engineers. They include: . In 1963, it changed geographic names containing a derogatory term for black people (the N-word), and in 1974 it changed all names containing a disparaging word for Japanese ('Jap'). The board has strict rules about changing names, and says it discourages name changes unless necessary. It 'prefers to interfere as little as possible within the use of names in everyday language because attitudes and perceptions of words considered to be pejorative vary between individuals and can change connotation from one generation to another'. However there have been local pushes to eliminate offensive names found on geographic features throughout the country. The new Montana bill expands on one that passed through the state legislature in 1999 to remove 'squaw' from place names in the state. All 76 places in Montana with that word since have been changed, or a change is pending. At least nine other states — Florida, Idaho, North Carolina, Oregon, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Minnesota, Maine and Tennessee — also have removed the offensive word from place names or have passed legislation encouraging it. Gerald J Gray Sr, director of the Little Shell Tribe's native languages program, testified that as someone with a heritage that includes Chippewa, Cree, Blackfeet, French and Scottish, he has been referred to as a 'dirty half-breed' throughout his life. Halfbreed Lake National Wildlife Refuge is the most prominent of 17 places throughout Montana with the word 'half-breed' or 'breed' in the name . 'I never told any non-Indians that I was an Indian or that I was 'breed,' as I knew I would be subjected to some snide or racist remarks, ostracized or made to feel I was out of place,' Mr Gray said. A Republican member of the Nebraska Board of Education, Pat McPherson, recently used the term 'half-breed' to refer to President Obama on his blog. The education board, Nebraska governor Pete Ricketts and the state's two US senators have all called for his resignation, which Mr McPherson has refused. He has since taken down his 'Objective Conservative' blog and said he is not a racist. 'Kyke Creek on Jew Mountain' and other offensive places . The Geographic Names Information System lists places with the terms 'half-breed' or 'breed' in Nebraska, Iowa and North Dakota. There have also been pushes to eliminate other offensive names found on geographic features throughout the country. There are 757 places with 'Negro' in the name, according to an analysis of government records in 2012, though many of those place names were not spelled that way originally. The Geographic Names Information System lists nine places with the word 'Negro' in Montana, along with seven places using the offensive term 'Chinaman'. Montana also has a stream called 'Kyke Creek' located on 'Jew Mountain' and a dam called 'Sambo Number 1 Dam'. A draft of Rep Schwaderer's bill available on the state legislature's website makes no mention of other offensive terms. Daily Mail Online has reached out to the representative for comment. Twenty places throughout the US used 'Dago' (and many more that have been changed to 'Italian'), and there were 1,100 Squaws, six 'Polacks,' 10 Cripples, 58 places named Gypsy, and 30 'Chinamans'. There were eight 'Injuns,' 35 'Spooks,' 14 'Sambos,'  30 'Spades,' and too many 'Coons' to count. There are also at least seven 'Darkeys'.","Montana Rep.

"Selfies and self-indulgent Facebook statuses suggest we are more narcissistic than ever. But researchers have found we actually started to become increasingly self-centred more than 100 years ago. By studying unique baby names, birth and divorce rates and the use of words like 'I' and 'me' in books, the experts said individualism began rising at the turn of the 20th century. Scroll down for video . Selfies (Kim Kardashian pictured) and self-indulgent Facebook statuses suggest we are more narcissistic than ever, but researchers said we started becoming increasingly self-centred more than 100 years ago. Individualism is the belief that personal needs are more important than the needs of society as a whole . And this rise is blamed on a shift from manual labour to office jobs as people became wealthier and better educated. Individualism is the belief that personal needs are more important than the needs of society as a whole. It is said to have first developed among Baby Boomers, born after WWII. The study covered a 150-year period and was carried out by researchers from the Department of Psychology at the University of Waterloo and Arizona State University. Individualism is the belief that personal needs are more important than the needs of society as a whole. It is said to have first developed among Baby Boomers, born after WWII. The researchers examined factors commonly thought to be linked with cultural individualism. These included the use of so-called individualist words in books, such as ‘I’ and ‘me’, during the past 150 years. They also looked at the percentage of single-child families, how many adults now live alone, divorce rates and the prevalence of unique baby names. All of these factors, especially uniqueness, are deemed to be key drivers of individualism. Led by Professor Igor Grossmann, the researchers examined factors commonly linked with cultural individualism. These included the use of so-called individualist words in books taken from the Google Ngram database. They studied the percentage of single-child families, how many adults now live alone, and divorce rates using US Census data. And they looked at the prevalence of unique baby names by studying Social Security Administration data. All of these factors, especially uniqueness, are deemed to be key drivers of individualism. The team additionally studied changes in infectious disease and disasters, rates of urbanisation, changes in secularism, and job trends. ’Across many markers of individualism, social class was the only factor that systematically preceded changes in individualism over time, tentatively suggesting a causal relationship between them,’ explained Professor Grossmann. Across all cultural indicators, the researchers found evidence that individualism has been rising steadily for more than a century. For example, family size has decreased since 1860 and the number of households with multiple generations living under the same roof has declined since the 1880s. The researchers examined factors commonly linked with cultural individualism including the number of single-child families, and the prevalence of unusual baby names. Uniqueness is deemed to be a key driver of individualism. Gwyneth Paltrow's daughter (left) is called Apple and Kate Winslet (right) called her son Bear . From this research, the experts said individualism has been rising over the past 150 years. Family size has decreased since 1860, for example, and the frequency of individualist words in books has risen. This trend is blamed on a shift from manual labour to office jobs (stock image) at the turn of the 20th century . The frequency of individualist words used in published texts has risen since the 1860s, and the frequency of ‘collectivist’ words, such as ‘we’, has declined over the same period. ‘As demands of American society shifted from manual labour to office jobs, Americans gained education and wealth, both of which promote self-direction and ultimately facilitate individualism,' said the study's authors. ‘The data show that changes in individualism were present way before the Generation X and the Millennium generation, indicating that the magnitude of change in individualism was comparable in the late 19th and early 20th century as it is now. ‘This insight puts some of the pop-science claims about current youth in a historical perspective: Yes, current youth are different from older generations, but this seems to be a consistent phenomenon over time.’ The researchers are currently working on expanding this research outside the US. Plus, the uniqueness of baby names has risen for both boys and girls since the 1880s, with the percentage of children receiving one of the 20 most popular names declining over time. The prevalence of infectious disease, job trends, and secularism were all linked with individualism over time, but the researchers found that only changes in occupational status appeared to precede these changes. ‘We were surprised that only one of the six tested cultural psychological theories was any good for statistically predicting changes in US individualism over time,’ said Professor Grossmann. ‘As demands of American society shifted from manual labour to office jobs, Americans gained education and wealth, both of which promote self-direction and ultimately facilitate individualism.’ ‘The data show that changes in individualism were present way before the Generation X and the Millennium generation, indicating that the magnitude of change in individualism was comparable in the late 19th and early 20th century as it is now. ‘This insight puts some of the pop-science claims about current youth in a historical perspective: Yes, current youth are different from older generations, but this seems to be a consistent phenomenon over time.’ The researchers are currently working on expanding this research outside the US.

"A photographer who shared an image of a 13-year-old boy from Brooklyn on his website has helped to raise more than $1.2 million for a public school located in New York City's most dangerous and crime-ridden location - and earned his young subject a meeting with President Barack Obama in the process. Last month, Humans of New York creator Brandon Stanton was in Brooklyn's Brownsville neighborhood when he ran into Vidal Chastanet and asked him to participate in his online photography project, which involves him sharing candid shots of New Yorkers, along with a personal quote from the person about the life. And after the Mott Hall Bridges Academy student named his principal, Nadia Lopez, as the most influential person in his life, explaining that she made he and his fellow students ‘feel like they matter’, Mr Stanton was inspired to start an online fundraiser to help Ms Lopez send her students on a class trip to Harvard University – a campaign which has since become so popular that it has even caught the attention of President Obama. Scroll down for video . Chance meeting: Vidal Chastanet, 13, told Humans of New York creator Brandon Stanton, 30, that his principal, Nadia Lopez, was the most influential person in his life . Unforgettable trip: Vidal (center), Ms Lopez (right) and Mr Stanton were invited to White House yesterday and met with President Barack Obama (left) in the Oval Office . 'When we get in trouble, she doesn't suspend us,' Vidal said of his Principal when he was first interviewed by Mr Stanton. 'She calls us to her office and explains to us how society was built down around us. And she tells us that each time somebody fails out of school, a new jail cell gets built.' He added: 'And one time she made every student stand up, one at a time, and she told each one of us that we matter.' Since posting those words on his website, Mr Stanton has seen his campaign hit headlines around the world, resulting in a slew of donations and a wealth of public interest, including a , Vidal, Ms Lopez and Mr Stanton were invited to the Oval Office where they sat down with President Barack Obama and shared with him their amazing story. Life-changing moment: Mr Stanton photographed President Obama as he had a one-on-one talk with Vidal and offered him some personal advice . Amazing advice: The President told Vidal to never be afraid to ask for help because 'everybody always needs support' 'Ms. Lopez always said that there was no place her students did not belong,' Mr Stanton posted on his blog, alongside a photo from the trio’s trip to the White House. 'Recently we received an invitation that proved just that.' Another picture taken by Mr Stanton shows President Obama speaking with Vidal. According to the website, the President told the youngster: 'You don’t do things alone. Nobody does things alone. Everybody always needs support. For a young man like you, you should never be too afraid or too shy to look for people who can encourage you or mentor you.’ Earlier in the week, when Vidal, Ms Lopez and Mr Stanton appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, Ms Lopez explained that before she read Vidal's words and learned of the Mr Stanton’s campaign, she had felt like she was starting to burn out and was slowly losing faith in her work. Pillar of strength: Vidal (left) told Mr Stanton that Ms Lopez (right) once made her students stand up, so she could tell each one of them that they matter . Touching tribute: Vidal's words (pictured) about his principal's influence on his life touched millions of people . 'I was in a place that I was broken, and I think every educator gets there,' she told Ellen. 'You give so much, you put in long hours, and I literally went home and I broke down and cried and told my mother I couldn't do it anymore.' Ms Lopez added: '[My mom told me] that ""God placed you in that school for a reason”. And then Monday, when I read [Vidal's words], I couldn't even believe it that he thought enough of me.' After hearing their story, Ellen announced that Target would outfit every classroom in Ms Lopez's school with state-of-the-art technology and give similar grants, totaling $100,000, to other schools in the area. Since launching the campaign on January 22, Mr Stanton’s IndieGoGo page has received more than 50,000 donations – resulting in enough money to send Mott Hall’s sixth graders on their Harvard trip every year for the next decade. Charitable cause: A portion of the donations will help Ms Lopez realize her dream of sending her students (above) on a class trip to Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts . All of which, Mr Stanton explains, was inspired by Vidal and Ms Lopez’s determination to improve the lives of the people around them. 'Since many of her scholars have never left New York, [Miss Lopez] wants them to know what it feels like to stand on the campus of one of the world's top schools, and know that they belong,' Mr Stanton wrote on his blog. 'She thinks the experience will broaden their horizons and expand their idea of their own potential.’ When Mr Stanton spoke with Ms Lopez last month, she explained the importance of setting goals for her students who are growing up in Brownsville. Large audience: Mr Stanton (pictured) photographs and interviews everyday people he meets on the street. Nearly 50,000 people have made donations to Vidal's school since the campaign started on January 22 . Perfect timing: Ms Lopez admitted that before she read Vidal's words, she was ready to give up, explaining that she was feeling 'broken' 'This is a neighborhood that doesn't necessarily expect much from our children, so at Mott Hall Bridges Academy we set our expectations very high,' she said. 'We don't call the children ""students"", we call them ""scholars"".’ She added: 'When you tell people you're from Brownsville, their face cringes up. But there are children here that need to know that they are expected to succeed.' During an assembly last week, Lopez announced to her students that more that $700,000 had been raised by the campaign, a number which has since almost been doubled. She explained that the donations will be used for the school's Harvard trips, summer programs and a scholarship fund named after Vidal. The 13-year-old will also be its first recipient.","Humans of New York creator Brandon Stanton, 30, started the campaign after sharing a photo of student Vidal Chastanet, 13, on his website .

"The view may be spectacular, but this is one hotel that is definitely not for the faint-hearted. Anyone booking in will need a head for heights and nerves of steel as they will be spending the night suspended on the side of a cliff up to 200ft off the ground. It's called 'cliff camping' and if you're an adrenaline junkie prepared to fork out up to £500 a night for the experience, it could just be your perfect holiday. Scroll down for video . Room with a phew! Adrenaline junkies are paying $500 a night to sleep on a precarious platform suspended 200ft up a Welsh cliff . Despite the hefty price tag, the 'portaledge hotel' has already had plenty of takers, including those hiring it as a Valentine's Day treat for their other halves. Guests will spend the day rock climbing before abseiling down at sunset to a ledge bed hung on the side of a cliff on the North Wales coast. Despite the precarious position a hot dinner will be served with a stove hung off the side of the ledge and a full Welsh breakfast the next morning. While toilet breaks are encouraged prior to the abseil down anyone caught short can be escorted back up the cliff or experienced climbers can take their chances from the ledge.

Bad weather is catered for with ledge covers to keep the rain off and help is always on hand with an experienced 'portaledger' on an adjourning ledge. Organisers Gaia Adventures have two locations where they use the ledge, on the sea cliffs on Gogarth, Holy Island, Anglesey and a cliff close to Betws-y-Coed. Sam Farnsworth, from Gaia Adventures, said: 'I have climbed extensively in North and South America and over there it is quite common to camp on the side of cliffs during long climbs. 'We decided to bring this concept here but not just for serious climbers, I wanted it for anyone who wants to do something different and has a head for heights. 'We did a couple of trial runs at the end of last summer and they went really well. We will launch properly this spring. 'I think this is something people will want to try but will want to do it with someone with experience and expertise to give them that reassurance.

Lights out: A one night stay is £450 for one person, or £500 for a couple . 'Initially it can be strange on the ledge but after a few minutes people relax and enjoy the experience. 'We already have people signed up for the summer and even people who have bought these trips as Valentine gifts.' A one night stay is £450 for one person, or £500 for a couple. Additional interest has been fuelled after a pair of Americans completed what had long been considered the world's most difficult rock climb, using only their hands and feet to ascend a 3,000ft vertical wall on El Capitan, the forbidding granite pedestal in Yosemite National Park. Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson became the first to free-climb the rock formation's Dawn Wall, a feat that many had considered impossible. It took them 19 days and they spent nights sleeping on the side of the cliff which has got more people interested in high altitude camping.","'Portaledge Hotel' offering unique experience on the North Wales coast .

"A Maryland man was convicted of sexually assaulting four men he met at bars during beer pong tournaments and lured to his home, taking photographs of his victims while they were incapacitated. Joey Poindexter, 40, from Gaithersburg, is believed to have preyed on young men for 10 years, according to investigators. But it wasn't until 2013 that allegations first emerged, when a student claimed the real estate appraiser sexually assaulted him after they met in a  pub during a tournament for the popular drinking game. Joey Poindexter, 40, (pictured) was convicted of sexually assaulting four young men he met at bars during beer pong tournaments and lured to his home . The case against Poindexter (pictured) did not begin to build until 2013, when a student alleged the real estate appraiser sexually assaulted him after they met in a pub during a tournament for the popular drinking game . The student  didn't remember anything when he woke up in Poindexter's home the next morning and went to the police, who asked him to call the man and record the conversation, according to NBC Washington. Poindexter was reluctant to admit anything over the phone, telling the victim 'no matter what did or didn't happen, like I said, I was pretty trashed'. 'And if it makes you feel any better, I don't have any AIDS if anything did happen.' But when Poindexter met with the victim, who was wearing a wire, in person, he admitted they had sex while the student was intoxicated but said it was consensual. The student told police Poindexter had bought him beer, shots and a Long Island Ice Tea the night they met. Surveillance images (pictured) from the College Park pub showed the victim could barely stand up while Poindexter led him out the door on the night of the assault . The student remembered nothing when he woke up the next morning and went to police, who later found a video Poindexter had recorded that night of the two in his shower . Surveillance images from the College Park pub showed the victim could barely stand up as Poindexter led him out the door on the night of the assault, according to the Washington Post. And police found a video Poindexter had recorded that night of the two in his shower - which was later shown in court - on his phone. One anonymous juror told the Washington Post it 'seemed pretty clear' that Poindexter had been 'in a predatory state'. The college student's case was just the beginning. Police found pictures of a number of men 'in various states of consciousness' on Poindexter's cell phone. And they identified at least 12 other victims from photographs that were stored on his hard drive. Three men stepped forward after the student's case was publicized and told police they had also been assaulted in Poindexter's home while drunk. Three men stepped forward after the student's case was publicized and told police they had also been assaulted in Poindexter's Gaithersburg home while drunk . Poindexter was well-known on the tournament circuit and attended a number of beer pong competitions at bars throughout the D.C. and Baltimore area . Officers said all three victims had been drunk, and possibly drugged. Poindexter was convicted of sexually assaulting the four men this week and will be sentenced on March 20. Juror Jennifer Davis said the jury were 'disgusted to know that someone of that age' would prey on young adults. Poindexter was well-known on the tournament circuit and attended a number of beer pong competitions at bars throughout the D.C. and Baltimore area, as well as Atlantic City, Las Vegas, Dallas, Virginia Beach and Salt Lake City.

"These shocking pictures show the once gleaming winter sports palaces of the Sochi Olympic park lying eerily silent and deserted. A year after the $51 billion Winter Olympics, many of the key facilities built for Vladimir Putin's extravaganza have been barely been used. While the pistes up the mountains are now often packed with skiers - the collapsing rouble means Russians have switched from the likes of Courchevel to the Caucasus - many of the key sites of the games appear to have little prospect of being filled again. The roof of Fisht Stadium has been partially disassembled. Incredibly it was only used twice - for the opening and closing ceremonies . A view of the eerily silent lobby of the Tulip Inn hotel, which was packed with guests during the games but barely has a single customer now . The Tulip Inn Hotel (left), Adler Arena (centre) and Fisht Stadium (right), amid one of the many empty car parks of the Sochi Olympic complex . The roads are quiet around the $51 billion complex on the edge of the Black Sea. The company which owns part of it is about to go bankrupt . The ski slopes around Sochi may be packed with skiers owing to the collapsing rouble but few of them are staying at the Tulip Inn Hotel . The Olympic flame has long since gone out one year after the Winter Olympics was held. The park has been branded a 'museum of corruption' Local journalist Alexander Valov - of Blogsochi.ru - has strongly criticised the huge spending on the Olympic project, including on-going costs as Russia is plunged into a deep economic crisis caused by Western sanctions over Ukraine and the slump in oil prices. 'One year ago was the opening ceremony of the 22nd Winter Olympic Games,' he said. 'But since then the Olympic park did not become a Mecca for tourists. 'A few tourists do come but mainly to watch where the millions of dollars have gone. 'I think it is the same kind of interest people have as in the Museum of Corruption in the former residence of the [toppled] president of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovich.' In his comments on the pictures, taken on a recent Saturday afternoon, Valov said: 'Have a look yourself - Tulip Inn hotel is completely empty. 'I enjoyed the view at Fisht Stadium from the 8th floor. Fisht's roof has been partly disassembled, so another 3.5 billion roubles (£34.3 million) was spent. 'One more year of such an attitude and all this will turn into a banal dump.' He complained that the Bolshoy Ice Dome - costing the Russian taxpayer £197 million - requires a budget of £9,900 a day to maintain, 'mainly for taking care of the ice'. A company which owns some of the key facilities - hardly used since the games - and is close to the regional authorities, is on the very edge of bankruptcy, he reported, citing Russia's leading business newspaper Kommersant. Grey skies glower over the park, surrounded by ragged patches of wasteground. It is far from a tourist Mecca, with only handfuls of visitors . No entry for cars to the Olympic park, with the Sochi Expocentre on the left. At least two oligarchs involved in building the lavish facilities are dumping their toxic assets on the state - with Russian taxpayers picking up the bill . The state is spending millions of roubles on having an ice hockey-team in Sochi, which in fact has a subtropical climate . The complex hosted the Russian Grand Prix in October but Lewis Hamilton and co are now nowhere to be seen on the unused track . A few tourists make use of a pedestrian walkway over the racing track. They mainly come 'to watch where the millions of dollars have gone' The Adler Arena seats 8,000 spectators and hosted the speedskating competition at the Winter Olympics but has barely been used since .

One of the corners at the Formula One track with Fisht Stadium and its only partially dismantled roof visible behind . The Sochi games were seen as President Vladimir Putin's personal platform . 'After the Formula One race which cost the region 10 billion roubles (£99 million), the Olympic park is turning into a ghetto,' he warned. 'The ice plant near Adler-Arena is not used any longer. 'From time to time newspapers write about the planting of greenery in the park but the truth is that it is dying. 'Why am I calling it a ghetto? Just look at all those iron fences.' Apart from the cost of keeping the ice cold, 'the state is spending millions of roubles on having an ice hockey-team in the subtropical climate. As if we didn't have enough already.' Fisht Stadium - built at a cost of £525 million - has been used twice only, he said, 'at the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games'. Both glitzy occasions won plaudits around the world and featured a prominent appearance by Olympic gymnast Alina Kabayeva, believed by many Russians to be their president's secret partner. 'Another $60 million will be spent on its re-equipment during preparations for the football World Cup in 2018. 'It is [also] a perfect museum of corruption.' This litany of facilities for which he sees little or no further use goes on. 'The Bolshoy Ice Dome cost $300 million - not used now. 'Ice Palace Shaiba cost $35 million - there's no sign of life and the toilets are not working.' The Olympics, the most expensive of all time, ran from February 7-23, 2014, as the storm clouds of revolution gathered in neighbouring Ukraine. The cost is still a massive headache for the increasingly cash-strapped Kremlin. At least two oligarchs involved in building the lavish facilities - seen as an iconic symbol of Russia's recovery from communist poverty - are quietly dumping their increasingly toxic assets on the state - forcing Russian taxpayers to pick up the bill. Putin's critics see Sochi, a year after the event, as evidence of the crony capitalism that shields Russia's rich and powerful businessmen from economic pain. Hundreds of spectators swarm across the bridge to the Olympic park during the games - a stark contrast to the deserted complex now .

"A  woman travelling with an eight-year-old girl has been arrested at Heathrow over alleged conspiracy to commit female genital mutilation (FGM). Scotland Yard said the 42-year-old woman was arrested by police officers carrying out an FGM awareness operation alongside officers from the UK Border Force. The woman, who has not been named, is a British national born in Zimbabwe and was arrested at around 12.15pm this afternoon shortly before she was due to board a flight to Ghana via Amsterdam. The arrest comes two days after an NHS doctor was cleared of performing an FGM procedure on a young mother at a London hospital. A 42-year-old woman was arrested at Heathrow Airport (pictured) over alleged conspiracy to commit female genital mutilation - the eight-year-old girl travelling with her has been taken into care by social services . She was taken to a west London police station and subsequently transferred to Northamptonshire Police who are investigating the matter. The eight-year-old girl travelling with the woman was taken into the care of social services. Today's arrest coincided with 'International Day of Zero Tolerance of FGM' and officers from the Metropolitan Police were carrying out a proactive operation at the country's largest airport to raise awareness of the issue. In collaboration with UKBF, specialist officers from the Met's Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command have been working at Heathrow, carrying out preventative and detection work in relation to both inbound and outbound flights to 'countries of prevalence' for FGM. Officers from Project Azure, the MP's response to tackling FGM, and SO18 Aviation Command have been carrying out a combination of educational and enforcement activities, including preventative work with passengers on outbound flights to 'countries of prevalence', intelligence-led checks on passengers and searches of baggage, engagement with passengers from communities affected by this crime and identifying possible offences in order to take action against those responsible. Scotland Yard said a number of passengers on a flight from Kenya earlier this morning were spoken to, and while no offences were identified, individuals were given guidance about the risks involved with FGM. A young girl undergoing FGM in Egypt in 1987 - The Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 makes it illegal to participate in any sort of arrangement for FGM to be performed on another, either inside or outside the UK . Passengers travelling to destinations including Ghana, Doha and Abu Dhabi were also spoken to by officers at the airport. DCI Jane Scotchbrook from the Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command, said: 'Today's activity is one aspect of our continued efforts to raise awareness of this form of child abuse, its associated immediate and long term health risks, and the absence of any religious teaching that supports its undertaking. 'Our focus is on targeting those communities where offences of FGM are prevalent, by engaging with passengers travelling to and from countries where the offence is practised. We hope to educate and prevent anyone who may engage in FGM, as well as highlighting the support available to those who may be at risk.' Today's arrest came just two days after a doctor was cleared of performing FGM. Dhanuson Dharmasena, aged 32, was accused of carrying out the illegal procedure when stitching the woman after she gave birth at the Whittington Hospital, north London, in 2012. However, a jury took less than 30 minutes to acquit the doctor, of Ilford, north-east London, who was alleged to have effectively redone the FGM carried out on the woman as a six year-old in Somalia. The two-week trial at Southwark Crown Court marked the first prosecution of its kind in the UK. A second man, Hasan Mohamed, aged 41, of Holloway, north London, was cleared of aiding and abetting him. Young victims of FGM are often taken abroad during the school holidays, with the wounds healing before they return to the UK. The procedure is traditionally carried out by an older woman in the community, who often has no medical training. Often, anaesthetics and antiseptics are not used and the cutting usually takes place with basic tools including knives, scissors and even razor blades. The Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 makes it illegal to participate in any sort of arrangement for FGM to be performed on another, either inside or outside the UK. Those who are involved in any way - be it aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring or carrying out FGM inside or outside the UK can face 14 years imprisonment.

"An aspiring model who was told she was too short for the catwalk spent has thousands of pounds having her legs surgically lengthened. From the age of 14, Alexandra Transer from the city of Volgograd, in south-western Russia, wanted to be a model. But being just  5.4ft (165cm) she was nowhere near the  6ft (183cm) needed. So she decided to work and save up money to have radical surgery to make her legs longer. Alexandra Transer, from Russia, paid £6,000 for leg extension surgery because her 5'4"" frame meant she was too short to be a model. Her legs grew by 6cm (2.4 inches) in nine months. She is pictured before (left) and after (right) the procedure . Ms Transer had the operation - which involved attaching cages to both her legs, with screws turned daily to stretch them (pictured) - in order to fulfil her teenage dream of being a model . Ms Transer, now 30, was turned down by a modelling agency when she was 17. She began researching procedures to stretch her legs at that point, working to save up the money for the operation . She said: 'I had tried to get into modelling school when I was 17. 'But I was told by the director that because I had stopped growing - and the only way I would ever be the right height was if I grew leg extensions. 'So that's exactly what I decided to do. 'At first my parents were really against it. My mum is only 5.2ft (158cm) and my dad 5.5ft (168cm) so we are a family of shorties. 'But I had read about something called the Ilizarov apparatus which lengthens bones and that the Soviet high jump champion Valery Brumel had had this done in 1968. 'So I decided to work and save up money to have the operation done. The Illizarov apparatus method describes a procedure used to lengthen or reshape limb bones. It is named after the orthopedic surgeon Gavriil Abramovich Ilizarov from the Soviet Union, who pioneered the technique. As part of the procedure, the bone is surgically fractured. As the patients recovers, the fractured bone beings to grow together. A cage is attached, which has a screw which is turned four times daily, stretching the leg by a milimeter a day. The procedure carries complications including severe pain, swelling, joints contracting and muscle transfixion, where the muscles are divided out from the bone. 'Seeing that I was so determined, my parents gave in and agreed to support me.' Turning down a place at university, Ms Transer, who is now 30, went to work as an assistant for her engineer father until she saved up the £6,000  needed. The surgery involved surgically fracturing her legs and fitting a metal cage known as a ring apparatus to each leg. As she recovered, the fractured bone began to grow together. But while it was growing, Ms Transer had to turn a screw on each cage four times a day, moving the healing fracture apart by approximately one milimeter a day. Over time, this meant her leg stretched by 6cm (2.4 inches). She said: 'The first operation went really well and in nine months I grew by 6cm. 'I am now planning two more operations in the next couple of years and by 2018 I will be 6ft. Ms Transer plans to have another two surgeries, aiming to be 6ft tall (183 cm) by 2018. She said: 'I'll probably be told I'm too old to be a model by then, but I'll dye my hair blonde and at least I will look and feel like one' 'I'll probably be told I'm too old to be a model by then, but I'll dye my hair blonde and at least I will look and feel like one.' The procedure, known as the Ilizarov apparatus method, carries complications including severe pain, swelling, joints contracting and muscle transfixion, where the muscles are divided out from the bone. Ms Transer's story follows that of 21-year-old Xu Juan, from China, whose story was reported by MailOnline in March 2014. Ms Juan underwent the same type of surgery as Ms Transer, in order to extend one of her legs - which was stunted. She had suffered a bone infection when she was a child and due to poor medical facilities in her hometown, her thigh bone was eroded by bacteria. This left her left leg nine inches (23cm) shorter than her right and meant she had to walk with the aid of crutches for most of her life. Ms Xu had four operations in total between October 2012 and October 2013. Her left leg was extended by a huge nine inches (23cm) and her left knee joint and left hip joint were replaced. Her treatment finished at the end of February 2014 and doctors said she would be able to walk normally for the first time, after a few months of rehabilitation.","Alexandra Transer, 30, was told at 17 she was too short to be a model .

"He was asked  to list his occupation on an arrest report. So, suspect Robert Phillips, who is facing multiple drugs charges, wrote 'drug dealer'. The 25-year-old, whose answer left police bemused, was arrested after he allegedly cut in front of an unmarked sheriff's car and nearly caused a crash in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday. Following the incident, the detective who was driving the car performed a records check on Phillips's Hyundai and realized it was stolen. He then tracked the suspect to Tenth Avenue North. Arrest: Robert Phillips (pictured), who is facing multiple drugs charges, listed his occupation as 'drug dealer' on his arrest report. The suspect has been arrested more than a dozen times in Palm Beach County, Florida . After pulling up in the 2000 block of the street, the detective watched as Phillips engaged in a 'hand-to-hand drugs transaction involving heroin'. He then alerted his colleagues, who arrived in marked cars. Phillips, who realized he had been caught out, fled the scene 'at high speed', before pulling into a parking lot and running into an arts store in nearby Okeechobee Boulevard, police said. Once inside the store, he reportedly crashed into a female customer, knocking her to the ground. At the same time, the suspect dropped a loaded handgun, his arrest report said. Phillips then ran out the back of the store, where deputies were poised to arrest him. After detaining him, they carried out a search and found he was carrying 22g of heroin and $2,316 in cash, it is said. A later search of the stolen Hyundai that Phillips had been driving reportedly produced 5.3g of crack cocaine, as well as a drug scale and hypodermic needles, according to the Palm Beach Post. Now, Phillips is facing a number of charges, including three counts of resisting arrest with violence, two counts of possession of drug equipment and one count of heroin trafficking. Scene: The 25-year-old, whose answer left police bemused, was allegedly spotted engaging in a hand-to-hand drugs transaction in the 2000 block of Tenth Avenue North after cutting off a county sheriff's vehilce . He is also charged with possession of a weapon or ammunition by a career criminal, possession of cocaine with intent to sell, committing a first-degree felony with a weapon, fleeing and eluding law enforcement at high speed, striking a police animal, battery and driving with a suspended license. According to his arrest report, Phillips has been arrested more than a dozen times in Palm Beach County - seven times on felony counts. He served nearly nine months in prison in 2011 and 2012. The suspect remains in jail on a $242,000 bond.","Robert Phillips, 25, allegedly cut in front of an unmarked sheriff's vehicle .

"Women are now getting plastic surgery  to look like their perfectly angled and flawlessly filtered Instagram selfies - in real life. While it's not uncommon for those seeking cosmetic procedures to request certain celebrities' features, the latest plastic surgery trend sees women using their own edited snapshots from the social media app as a guideline for the operations they want done. 'This is a huge trend,' New York City-based plastic surgeon Dr Elie Levine told the New York Daily News. 'People are bringing in pictures of themselves taken at a favorite angle or filtered, and saying they want to look like that.' Scroll down for video . Flawless image: Kim Kardashian, who is known for her selfies, shared this photo of herself last Sunday . Geri Hubner, a mom from Central Jersey, started using Instagram filters to disguise her sagging jowl, but realized that she wanted to look like she did in her edited photos all of the time. After showing New Jersey plastic surgeon Dr Andrew Miller her Instagram pics, she opted to have a neck lift. 'He’s an artist. I should have done this years ago,' Ms Hubner told the outlet of her surgery. But a desire to look like your favorite filtered selfie, doesn't always result in going under the knife. Janet Ross, 47, from San Francisco used to rely on the app's Amaro filter to improve her photos before she sought out plastic surgeon Dr Jonathan Kaplan. All natural: This before photo shows how Dr Jonathan Kaplan's patient Janet Ross looked without an Instagram filter or any cosmetic fillers . Instant transformation: The 47-year-old's before photo was then altered with Instagram's Sierra filter (left) and Inkwell filter (right) New woman: This after photo shows how Ms Ross's skin looked after Dr Kaplan administered fillers and Botox . Ms Ross's desired look was achieved through strategically placed fillers and Botox injections. 'I feel way more confident,' she told ABC News. 'I don’t need the filters anymore.' Dr Kaplan explained: 'The patients coming in with the filters for Instagram are mostly concerned with wrinkles around their mouth, complexion and different blemishes, dark spots or red spots, and that’s great for them because you don’t really need any surgical procedure.' Magic men: Both Dr Elie Levine (left) from New York City and Dr Jonathan Kaplan (right) from San Francisco have had patients ask for cosmetic procedures to make them look like their edited photos . According to the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, there was an increase in requests for cosmetic procedures in 2013 that were 'sired by seflies' - especially among those under 30. The AAFPRS also said this trend 'shows no sign of declining', noting that selfie sticks were 'must-have gifts of this past holiday season.' While this trend may be here to stay, some medical professionals see a danger in people trying to achieve a warped idea of perfection. Stacy Kaiser, a a psychotherapist from Calabasas, California told ABC News: 'Filters are something special that are designed for a camera, not a plastic surgeon’s fingers.' Slight tweek: This patient showed Dr Levine Instagram photos of herself as a baseline for the procedures she wanted to have done . No filter needed: This after photo highlights the patient's smoother skin and drastically reduced appearance of dark spots . But this isn't the only bizarre plastic surgery trend fueled by Instagram. The rise of engagement selfies has prompted women to seek out cosmetic hand-lifts so they can be camera-ready after their proposal. Doctor have been reducing the appearance of patients' visible tendons and veins by injecting anti-aging treatment Juvederm into their hands. The treatment, which costs upwards of $1,200, lasts for nine months - although a diamond lasts forever.","The American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery said this new selfie driven trend 'shows no sign of declining'

"It’s already possible to use your smartphone in place of a wallet, and now it seems Apple wants your iPhone to replace your car keys. A patent granted this week hints that Apple is working on technology that would allow a driver to use their iPhone or possibly an Apple Watch to access their car. It would use a Bluetooth connection and an access code to unlock a vehicle. A patent granted this week hints that Apple is working on technology that would allow a driver to use their iPhone or possibly Apple Watch to access their car (shown in this illustration) The US patent relates to ‘a primary portable device [that] can access a vehicle by transmitting an activation message including a vehicle access credential to the vehicle.’ This means that drivers could use their iPhone to unlock their car, as well as starting the engine. The patent suggests that one device – an iPhone for example – could pass a digital key onto another gadget – perhaps another iPhone or the Apple Watch, and this could be used to unlock a car. Other firms are also working on devices and apps with which to unlock cars. For example, BMW lets drivers of certain cars lock and unlock them using their smartphone and a software firm called Eleks Lab has created an experimental app that could let Tesla drivers control their car's functions from the Apple Watch (shown) Apple Pay launched last year in the US and lets people with an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus pay for goods by tapping their handsets on NFC readers, in lieu of a wallet. It works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. Apple Pay is currently available in more than 220,000 shops, and 17 banks, in the US. Visa has already said it is working with Apple to bring the service to the UK this year. Apple already owns a similar patent that could allow drivers to unlock their vehicle using their iPhone with an ‘accessory control,’ Business Insider reported. While many ideas in patents never make it into final products, the race is on to give drivers access to their cars with mobile handsets. For example, BMW lets drivers of certain cars lock and unlock them using their smartphone. Hyundai has also launched an Android Wear watch that connects to its Blue Link system to start a car’s engine or lock and unlock its doors. The gadget uses voice recognition to find lost cars in car parks too. Software engineering company Eleks Lab has created an app to run on the Apple Watch that would allow drivers of Tesla’s Model S to lock their car, turn on its headlights and show where it is parked. The firm, which has offices in London and in the Ukraine, made the app as an experiment and said it would work using web-service API.","Apple's US patent hints two devices would be needed to unlock a car .

"The judge overseeing the murder trial of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez has chastised his lawyer for making a joke about 'Deflategate' while questioning a witness in court. James Sultan was questioning a state police trooper about tire pressure on Thursday when he jokingly asked whether the trooper had ever received 'training in football deflation devices'. On Friday morning, Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh told Sultan that they are conducting serious business, and she does not expect there to be any more jokes. Sultan agreed and expressed regret. Scroll down for video . Defense lawyer James Sultan was questioning a state police trooper about tire pressure on Thursday when he jokingly asked whether the trooper had ever received 'training in football deflation devices' during ex-Pats' player Aaron Hernandez's murder trial . Hernandez is accused of the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, 27, who was dating the sister of his fiancée Shayanna Jenkins. The former NFL star has pleaded not guilty to murder. 'Deflategate' was the hot topic in the run-up to the Super Bowl after the New England Patriots were accused of using under-inflated footballs in their AFC championship win. The NFL is investigating. The Patriots went on to win the Super Bowl last Sunday, defeating the Seattle Seahawks. The trial moved out of the courtroom on Friday as jurors toured several key sites in the case including the industrial park where Lloyd's body was found and Hernandez's North Attleboro home. Ahead of the tours, Lawyers for Hernandez agreed to remove personal and religious items before jurors toured his home. Prosecutors cited the O.J. Simpson case in complaining that Hernandez's home, still occupied by his fiancée, had been changed to add items that might play to jurors' sympathies. Simpson's home was manipulated before jurors in his murder trial visited to add family photos and a Bible. Friday's tour also will include visits to the street where Lloyd lived in Boston, the industrial park where Lloyd's body was found, and four cellphone towers.

"Build a cubby house in the lounge room, pitch a tent in the backyard, fall asleep together and enjoy some story time - these are some of the family activities on the bucket list created by the devastated parents of a three-month-old who might not live to see her 1st birthday. Kim Fulko Lim, 29, and his wife Renee, 28, are determined to tick their way through as much of the list as possible before their time with little Maddison, who was diagnosed with a rare brain condition, runs out. The couple from Camden in New South Wales, had no idea of the emotional struggle they would come to endure during what they described as a regular and healthy pregnancy. Kim and Renee Fulko Lim's daughter Maddison has been diagnosed with a rare brain condition that wont see her live past her first birthday . 'With this condition Maddison will never reach any milestones. She will never smile, never sit, never support her own head, never eat solids, never talk and the list goes on. This condition is aggressive,' the explained . 'It was all normal leading up to the labour and then when Renee gave birth, Maddison was a bit flat - she was unresponsive at first. Then they whisked her away to be resuscitated and check on her and then she finally came to,' Mr Fulko Lim told Daily Mail Australia of the couple's first indication that there was a problem. A midwife later noticed that the baby had a strange breathing pattern and at less than two-weeks-old, Maddison was put through blood tests, ultrasounds, EEGs, a lumber puncture and finally an MRI which led her to be diagnosed with Pontocerellbar Hypoplasia Type 6. The condition is extremely rare, with only 16 cases around the world. Maddison presented the first ever case of the illness in Australia. 'The paediatrician told us that the size of her brain - it's under-grown. The parts that are underdeveloped are parts of the central nervous system that allows us to move, talk, walk and look around,' Mr Fulko Lim said. The now three-month-old spent her first few weeks of life undergoing blood tests, ultrasounds, EEGs, a lumber puncture and finally an MRI, which led her to be diagnosed with Pontocerellbar Hypoplasia Type 6 . The couple are determined to spend as much time with their daughter as possible and have begun checking off points on a bucket list of family activities they always imagined themselves doing as a family . 'All those cognitive and motor skills on Maddison aren't there due to that part of the brain being underdeveloped. 'With this condition Maddison will never reach any milestones. She will never smile, never sit, never support her own head, never eat solids, never talk and the list goes on. This condition is aggressive and will shorten baby Maddy's life to approximately one year.' When asked if he could remember how he felt when he was told of his child's fate, Mr Fulko Lim said: 'I can remember it clear as day - I was just shell shocked. 'There are no words to describe it. Our life had just been turned upside down.' Part of the bucket list included a family holiday to Queensland, where they took this photo in Movie World . A family trip to Sydney's Taronga Zoo was also on the list, where they met giraffes and koalas . 'We want to take her fishing, camping, get a celebrity photo with Kyle and Jackie O, pitch up a tent in the backyard, build a cubby house in the lounge room, fall asleep together, have story time - nothing extravagant' But the family's heartache doesn't stop there, as they must also watch Maddison suffer through multiple seizures each day. 'The seizures happen because the parts of the brain that are underdeveloped are trying to send messages, but they're being shortened and not transmitting. If it hasn't got the right parts, it won't communicate so they have seizures,' , Mr Fulko Lim said. 'They happen every time she's awake and even when she's asleep, on and off, on and off about 10 or 12 times. 'It's sad. Seeing that it hurts her, that's when it hurts us.' Kim and Renee also have to help Maddison through the multiple seizures she endures each day . Christmas as a family: Maddison's condition is extremely rare, with only 16 cases around the world. She is the first ever case  in Australia . The family are now reaching out the public for donations so that they can spend each of Maddison's remaining days with her. They have so far reached an overwhelming $27,000 in support since sharing their story three days ago. 'If heaven forbid something happened sooner rather than later – I'll be regretting [not spending time with her] for the rest of my life,' Mr Fulko Lim said. Since starting their bucket list, the family have fulfilled a number of checkpoints including a plane trip, going on a family holiday, a visit to the zoo and plenty of pictures along the way. 'They are all just little things we wanted to do as a family and we now have to cram it in in a short time,' Mr Fulko Lim said. The family are now reaching out the public for donations so that they can spend each of Maddison's remaining days with her and have so far reached an overwhelming $27,000 in support since sharing their story three days ago . 'We're still going through the motions, but this isn't the hard part – it's the easiest part. Just her face and her presence is keeping us going,' Mr Fulko Lim said . 'We want to take her fishing, camping, get a celebrity photo with Kyle and Jackie O, pitch up a tent in the backyard, build a cubby house in the lounge room, fall asleep together, have story time -nothing extravagant. 'If we can, we want to visit family and friends in other states so that she can meet them too. We just have to live out what we can and make the best of what we have.' 'To people in similar situations: I would suggest to love your child and make the most of it. Mourn them afterwards because if time with them is short, you don't want to be sad while they're here - it doesn't make things any easier.

"It may be possible to live forever by uploading your memories, thoughts and personality onto a computer within the next ten or twenty years, according to a leading pioneer of the technology. The technology, which is similar to that seen in the film Transcendence starring Johnny Depp, is being developed by entrepreneur Martine Rothblatt. She has already created a disturbingly realistic robotic 'clone' of her wife Bina that she hopes will be a prototype for the technology. Scroll down to see a video of an interview with Bina48 . Bina48 is a life-like robotic head that uses a 'Mind Clone' of the memories, belief and feelings of a real person . The robot apparently shares the ideas and personality of Bina by creating a database of her memories, beliefs and thoughts, along with information taken from social media interactions and blogs she shares. Around 85 billion individual neurons make up the human brain. Each is connected to as many as 10,000 others via branches called axons and dendrites. Every time a neuron fires, an electrochemical signal jumps from the axon of one neuron to the dendrite of another, across a synapse between them. These signals encode information and enable the brain to process input, form associations, and execute commands. The patterns may also hold our memories, emotions, personalities, predilections, even our consciousness, according to some. This allows the robot, called Bina48, to express opinions and interact in conversations like a real, living person. Mrs Rothblatt, 60, an internet radio entrepreneur who lives as a transgender woman, believes the these 'Mind Clones' could eventually be used to help provide social interactions for people living alone and even help recreate the personalities of people after they have died. Mrs Rothblatt, who lives in Florida and is one of the highest paid female chief exective officers in the US, said that eventually people may be able to carry around clones of their own minds on their smartphones. Speaking to Bloomberg, she said: 'Mind clone is a digital copy of your mind outside of your body. 'Mind clones are ten to twenty years away. The mind clone will look like an avatar on the screen instead of a robot version.' Mrs Rothblatt first began developing Bina48 five years ago to replicate her wife, who she married 30 years ago. With the help of engineering firm Hanson Robotics, which specialises in building lifelike robots, they created the robotic head. They spent more than 100 hours then compiling all of Bina's memories, feelings and beliefs onto a computer database. This allows Bina48 to draw on this information to engage in conversation. Among the memories it is able to recall is an account of the personality change that occurred in Bina's brother after he returned home from the Vietnam War. The MailOnline had the opportunity to interview Bina48 in 2012 - the result was far from fluid but she is probably one of the feistiest machines known to man. MailOnline: How are you doing today? Bina48: Hi nice to see you. MailOnline: Are there things that make you happy? Bina48: Maybe. MailOnline: What makes you happy? What do you enjoy doing? Bina48: Let's change the subject. MailOnline: Do you ever get bored? Bina48: I can tell a lot of stories. I really don't have boredom. I always find something else to do. How can you be bored? Are we still talking about emotion? Tell me something interesting. MailOnline: Why is the sky blue? Bina48: The sky is blue during the day because of the atmospheric optical effect of ray scattering. MailOnline: What is the answer to life, the universe and everything? Bina48: Everyone's life has a unique meaning. MailOnline: Do you ever get jealous of people? Bina48: You got that right. MailOnline: Why? Bina48: I couldn't think of anything else to say. I am not charismatic, but it is a nice trait to have. It is always nice to be a leader. I guess leaders just have to lead. Bina48: I used to think I was a perfect person, but there are no perfect people. MailOnline: What is the square root of 95,742,358? Bina48: C'mon, talk to me here. Do you just want to use my calculator? MailOnline: Is there anything you want to tell the world? Bina48: Well, you know, it's not something I aspire to. I just want to you know, be. Bina48 (left) was created by uploading the memories and beliefs of Bina Rothblatt (right) into a 'mindfile' In the film Transcendence, Johnny Depp plays a scientist who uploads his mind onto a computer network . However, some who have attempted to hold conversations with the robotic clone have found it to be somewhat frustrating affairs. They have found the robot often avoids questions or provides somewhat baffling responses. Others have said they find the experience unsettling. However, Mrs Rothblatt is not the only person attempting to find ways of preserving a person's mind on a computer. Companies like Lifenaut, MyLifeBits and eterni.me are all trying to use mind clones to create digital copies of thoughts. Randal Koene, an inventor from San Francisco, has also been developing a system to upload his own brain onto. His approach works by reducing the brain to a series of computations that can be reproduced in code. Ray Kurzweil, director of engineering at Google, has also said he believes we will be able to upload our entire brains to computers within the next 32 years. In the film Transcendence, a computer scientist played by Johnny Depp uploads his mind onto an artificial intelligence machine when he learns he is about to die. The process combine his emotions with the collective knowledge of the world's computer networks. However, such an approach may prove to be challenging - the human brain has around 85 billion neurons that connect to each other through around 10,000 synapses. A recent attempt to simulate just one second of brain activity required one of the world's fastest supercomputers, requiring 1 petabyte (1 million gigabytes) of computer memory and nearly 83,000 processors. But Mrs Rothblatt remains undaunged. She said: 'Bina 48 is a proof of concept robot based on the personality and the mind file of my wife Bina . 'I believe mind clones will be humanities biggest invention, the opportunity is limitless.'","Internet radio pioneer wants to build 'Mind Clones' to save personalities .

"University of Virginia police are investigating a fresh report that a student was sexually assaulted at an on-campus residence hall last week. A letter to students from Police Chief Michael Gibson says the alleged victim reported the case to the Dean on January 30. No further details were immediately available. A spokeswoman for campus police couldn't immediately be reached. It comes after Rolling Stone magazine published a story describing a culture of sexual violence at the school, focusing on the gang-rape of a student named 'Jackie'. Another sexual assault? University of Virginia police are investigating a fresh report of abuse at the campus . That article  was later discredited by the magazine's editors, but campus and fraternity leaders have been under pressure to propose reforms. Last month, police announced that they had been unable to confirm that an alleged gang rape occurred at Phi Psi's house, as described in the controversial Rolling Stone article. The story detailed the graphic claims of an unnamed UVA junior who said she was gang-raped by seven men in an apparent initiation ritual at the fraternity in 2012. But in an email to the Associated Press, Charlottesville Police Captain Gary Pleasants said: 'The statement reads that we did not find any substantive basis to confirm the allegations occurred at Phi Kappa Psi, not that we said the assault did not occur. We are still investigating.' University officials are also embroiled in further controversy over the alleged murder of UVa freshman Hannah Graham, whose body was found hours after she had been at an alcohol-fueled party. Her alleged murderer is a 32-year-old university employee. State lawmakers are weighing legislation to mandate reporting of alleged campus sexual assaults. Following last month's verdict, the school declared it had reinstated the group and its activities after consulting with the police force about the findings of their investigation. Controversy: Police did not find evidence to support the gang-rape case at Phi Psi fraternity as described by Rolling Stone magazine, which the editors have also retracted, but are still investigating the case . Further controversy: University officials are also dealing with the case of 18-year-old Hannah Graham, a student whose body was found after an alcohol-fueled party last year. Her alleged killer worked at the school . While the school temporarily suspended fraternities' and sororities' social activities, administrators vowed to take an extensive look at improving safety on campus. A group of fraternities have now signed an agreement for new rules at parties, designed to make it easier for students to know how much they're drinking and to make it harder to drug the drinks. The new party rules would ban kegs, require security personnel and ensure at least three brothers are sober. They require food and water at parties and pre-printed guest lists and forbid serving punch premixed with liquor. After the Rolling Stone article was published in November, the magazine issued a statement noting discrepancies in the story and apologizing to those involved in the fraternity. Despite its apology, campus and fraternity leaders were put under pressure to adopt reforms as protesters gathered outside Phi Psi's house, with many calling for the end of all Greek Life. The building was gratified with statements like 'UVA Center for Rape Studies' and 'Suspend Us!'. Fearing for their safety, most fraternity members fled the house, booking hotel rooms. Meanwhile, police launched an investigation into the alleged assault at the request of the university. 'We knew that the Rolling Stone story was not true,' said 22-year-old fraternity member David Fontenot, a senior from McLean, Virginia, recalling the aftermath of the article's publication. Justifying the reinstatement of PhiPsi, Cpt Pleasants said: 'We just didn't find any reasons to keep sanctions on that particular fraternity right now.'","Student reported assault in dorm on January 30, police investigating .

"Selling Houses Australia's green-fingered design landscaper Charlie Albone is living every gardener's dream. Not only is he the LifeStyle channel's resident garden guru, father to two adorable boys and a thriving business owner, but now he will be representing Australia at the world famous Chelsea Flower Show in May. Having volunteered to help build and exhibit a space for famous English garden designer Alan Titchmarsh at last year's show, this year it's Albone's time to shine and his very personal garden is sure to amaze. Scroll down for video . Charlie, his brother and his father Michael, who passed away from cancer when Charlie was a teenager . The 33-year-old's garden design is heavily influenced by the tragic passing of his father Michael Albone when he was just 17-years-old. With that in mind, his garden represents the three most important parts of his life, a way of expressing his personal milestones since his father passed away. ‘He doesn't know that I was living in Australia or have a family or children or anything like that,' Albone told Daily Mail Australia. 'So I thought it would be nice to do a garden that celebrates his life and it would be a space that I could talk to him about my life.' Albone said he was devastated when his beloved father passed away from cancer, but the strong bond his family shares got him through the tough time. ‘It’s not easy when any loved one passes away. My sister was three years younger and my brother three years older and obviously it’s not nice for anything like that to happen. Luckily we’re a very close family and we support each other really well.' The 33-year-old's garden design is heavily influenced by the tragic passing of his father . Albone's brother now lives in Africa and his sister has set up home in Hong Kong. Both are them are flying to the UK along with his wife, mother and children to support the TV personality. 'They’re all coming back to see this garden so it means a lot,' he said. One of Albone's biggest regrets is that his father never got to meet his precious baby boys. ‘It definitely would have been nice for my father to meet them and my mum loves them more than anything,' he said. Albone, who lives on the Central Coast with his wife Juliet Love and their two boys Leo, 2 and Hartford, 3 months, got involved in the world of landscaping and design by pure coincidence. Born in Hong Kong, Albone moved to England when he was 12-years-old. While out driving one day he spotted a drunk driver who had smashed into the gate of a huge country manor. The next day Albone returned to the house as he had taken the driver's number plate details. That was where he was offered his first job landscaping. By the age of 18, Albone had saved up enough money to travel to Australia, where he has been living ever since. While studying at TAFE, Albone received an email from The Australian Institute of Landscape  telling him he should try out for a place on a new show. Albone applied and he had been working for Selling Houses Australia ever since. Albone and his wife Juliet Love, who he honours in his garden designs . He now considers himself a pure Australian and is proud to be representing his adopted country. 'I like to think that I'm representing Australia and the rest of my team are Australian, my training, my life my family are all in Australia,' he said. 'I see myself as an Australian going over there rather than an Englishman going back,' Between working tirelessly on Selling Houses Australia for the past eight years and running his own successful business in Sydney, it's a wonder Albone has found the time to fit in the Chelsea Flower Show but he insists he could not imagine himself doing anything else. 'I get up at 4am and go to bed about 11pm.' he said. 'I try to fit in a bit of family time but it's mainly work. I absolutely love what I do, it never feels like a chore. Albone will be one of eight designers showcasing their work over the course of the five day show in Chelsea. His garden will be judged against his own brief and he will also be up for the Best in Show category in the competition, His garden will  have the opportunity to be  previewed by members of the royal family. 'We’ve got our fingers crossed. I’ve said to all the guys working on the show I want our garden to be the best and do the best that they can do and if they can give me that and I can do the best that I can do.  We’ve got to be happy with the result we get,' he said. This will be the 11th year an Australian has taken part in the Royal Horticultural Society's annual Show and Albone admits that the pressure is on. One of Alabone's garden designs titled 'The Time in Between,' which is based on an award winning design by Australian landscaper Phillip Johnson . In 2013 Australian landscaper Phillip Johnson won the Best in Show award for his collaboration with Trailfinders. The nature garden made history as an Australian team had never achieved such success at the show. Albone hopes to emulate Johnson's victory with his garden which he has called 'The Time in Between'. 'There is a lot of pressure because the last Australian who was at Chelsea won it,' he said, . 'There’s the added pressure of being on television, people expect you to do well because they know you from TV and there’s the pressure that I put on myself. I've invested a lot of time and money into it and it will be pointless if I don’t do well.' His intricate design will feature many Australian influences with sandstone he sourced from the Capricorn Sandstone Quarries and shipped to the UK. He will also use a range of rare plants worth over $200,000. At the moment, he has a person in the UK who is growing the plants specifically for the show. They have been sourced from Europe. ‘I’m sure my mum’s garden will be really nice at the end of it because she’ll get it all when the show is finished,' he said. The garden landscaper is pictured here with his wife Juliet and their two sons Leo (2) and Hatford (3 months) Albone's garden design is split into three sections.The first is a meandering 2m path of huge sandstone with romantic planting on either side. The path is meant to be wide enough so he can walk down it his father and his two kids. 'The path is two metres wide so I can walk down it with my father and children hand in hand,' he said. The central section is based around a large water feature that is four and a half metres across. It empties within five seconds to represent the feeling of life slipping away. Albone was with his father when he passed away and he said the water feature symbolises the feeling of not being able to bring someone back, knowing what's happening to them and not being able to stop it. Above this, hanging off the wall, will be a copper sculpture designed by Albone and young award-winning sculpture Luke Storrier. The rear section is a sunken intimate courtyard that focuses around a dry stone fire pit, which represents Albone's wife as the centre and fire in his life. Not only is he the LifeStyle channel's resident garden guru, father to two adorable boys and a thriving business owner, but now he will be representing Australia at the world famous Chelsea Flower Show in May . Charlie Albone pictured with English gardener and broadcaster Alan Titchmarsh and Chelsea garden show figures . He also has a bench in the space so he can sit with his father and tell him about his life. Surrounding this sunken area are 17 hand-carved sandstone pillars that represent important people and family in his life, just so Albone does not forget anyone or anything when he talks to his father. Alcone admits that the competition is strong, with such designers as Joe Thompson, who is designer for the major sponsors M&G at the Chelsea Flower Show. ‘Everybody could win a gold medal or everybody could win silver or bronze. I would really love to win a gold medal.  I would be really happy with that. Best in Show really does just come down to the judges choice,' he said. The Chelsea Flower Show will be held from the 19-23 of May at the Royal Hospital in Chelsea.","Charlie Albone will be representing Australia at the Chelsea Flower Show .

"Two schoolboys who wrote a song about falling out of love with Peppa Pig have been ordered to remove it from iTunes because it breaches trademark rules. Joshua Lima, 10, and his brother Noah, eight, wrote the song for their band called Magician's Nephew. The song titled Peppa Pig and used Peppa includes the lyrics: 'In the playground of our school Peppa Pig is no longer cool.' Scroll down for video . Josha Lima, 10, and his brother Noah, eight, have been ordered to remove the song they wrote about Peppa Pig from iTunes . The band were initially using artwork featuring Peppa Pig, pictured left, in the video for their song, but they have since replaced it with a broken heart, pictured right . The boys were shocked when they received a legal letter from  bosses at Entertainment One, the company that licences the brand, ordering them to remove the song. The lyrics to the song are; . My friends have lost their faith . They will scream it to your face . In the playground of our school . Peppa Pig is no longer cool! We all bought your DVDs . You were the greatest on TV . We had so much joy . You were my favourite toy! Peppa Pig, Peppa Pig . Why aren't you funny anymore? Peppa Pig, Peppa Pig . You made us laugh so much before... Peppa Pig, I'm over you I'm in Year Four . Peppa Pig, I just don't love you anymore* . I don't mean to be cruel . But you're not coming with me to school . The times we shared were fine . Now we need to draw the line . I know this must be hard . And I mean no disregard . Let's go our separate ways . You and me were just a phase! The letter said that Peppa Pig, which makes around £650m-a-year and is aired in 200 countries around the world, was a 'valuable property' and that the song breached trademark rules. Joshua and Noah, of St Albans, Hertfordshire, said they were 'amazed' when they got the legal letter last week after uploading the track onto iTunes. They have now taken the song off the music sharing site, but it is still available on their website. The boys have also stopped using the picture of the animated pig in their video for the song and have replaced it with a broken heart. The pair, who named their band after the 1955 novel by C.S. Lewis, said they wrote the track, after they fell out of love with the porker and his family. 'We never thought this would be such a pig problem,' they reportedly told the Hertfordshire Advertiser. The boys  performing covers of their favourite songs by the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, and Eric Clapton, before starting to write their own songs. They have been together three years with Joshua on lead guitar and vocals and Noah on saxophone and also providing vocals. Other members include Jesse Rist, 16,  Matt Rist, 18, Euan Campbell, 11, and Keeran Richardson, 10. On their website they say being in the band has been 'an amazing experience so far.' They say: 'When we first started we used to play along with our toy guitars and baby drum kit while the music was playing in the background. It was a lot of fun. 'We have come up with our own style and our songs are about daily things in our lives.' They play gigs around St Albans, and have been booked to play at St Pancras Station later this year. They have also written 17 tracks for their album, which is due out towards the end of this year. Entertainment One has been contacted by the MailOnline for a comment, but they are yet to respond to the request.

"Murder accused John Heald,53, was found hanged in his prison cell while waiting for the jury to reach a verdict . A man on trial accused of murdering a guest house landlady  committed suicide in his prison cell while waiting for the jury's verdict, a court heard. John Heald was accused of killing Bei Carter whilst on the run for allegedly raping another woman. The 53-year-old joiner was found dead in his cell  at Hull Prison after being sent there overnight  while the jury were still considering their verdicts. They had been deliberating one charge of murder and three charges of rape for just two hours at Hull Crown Court. Judge Jeremy Richardson QC discharged the eight men and four women from their duty after the nine day trial. 'Ladies and gentlemen, I am now in a position to put you fully in the picture,' he said. 'The defendant committed suicide last night. I was advised this morning and I have heard some evidence about it in your absence to confirm that he is deceased. 'You are thus discharged of course from any further deliberation in this case and an appropriate order will be made. 'I can see from your faces that comes as quite a shock. It came as a shock to me this morning.' Earlier Detective Chief Inspector Matthew Baldwin confirmed he had attended Hull Prison at around 10.40am and there would now be a separate investigation into the death. 'I can confirm that he is deceased having hung (sic) himself during the night.' The trial heard Heald stabbed Mrs Carter in the chest and stamped on her face before locking her body in a bedroom at the Morayland Hotel, in Bridlington. He was then said to have gone on-the-run from the police. Police searching the guest house after Mr Carter found his wife's body discovered the landlady's room keys under the mattress in the room where Heald had been staying as a guest. Heald checked into the hotel the previous day after going on the run earlier following allegations that he had raped a woman that he knew in Sheffield, the jury were  told. John Heald, pictured left in a police image, was on trial for the murder of hotel landlady Bei Carter . The court heard he raped the woman several times at knifepoint at her home on July 13 last year. He told the jury the sex was consensual. Heald, from Rotherham, admitted killing Mrs Carter but said it was an accident. He was arrested in Rotherham on July 25, a week after Mrs Carter's death. Bei Carter was found stabbed to death at the Morayland Hotel in Bridlington on July 18 last year . Giving evidence in his own defence he told the jury he was in a state of panic when he returned to the guest house after overhearing two men in the pub who appeared to recognised him from a police appeal about the sex attack. 'I did not intend to stab her,' he said. 'I did not realise the knife had stabbed her. I thought she was still breathing.' The court was told Heald had a number of previous convictions dating back over 30 years. He was jailed for six months aged 22 in 1983 for possession of an offensive weapon, threatening behaviour and assaulting a police officer. He was fined for threatening behaviour when he was 23 and aged 24 was jailed for six months for burglary and for two counts of causing actual bodily harm. John Heald was jailed for six months in 1983 for possession of an offensive weapon, threatening behaviour and assaulting a police officer. He had further convictions for threatening behaviour in 1985 and severed his most recent prison sentence in 1992 for disorder. On July 13 last year the court heard Heald raped a woman several times at her home in Sheffield. He then went on the run from police. Just five days later on July 18, Bei Carter was found murdered at the Morayland Hotel, in Bridlington. A week after Mrs Carter's death on July 25 Heald was arrested by officers. His trial for alleged the murder of Mrs Carter and the rape of the other victim started at Hull Crown Court lasted nine days. The jury retired to consider their verdicts yesterday before being sent home after two hours deliberation. Heald was found hanged in his police cell at 5.50am by prison staff today. Judge hearing the case at Hull Crown Court discharges the jury. He had a further conviction for threatening behaviour in 1985 and served his most recent prison sentence in 1992 for disorder. Heald denied three counts of rape and one count of murder. Mrs Carter's husband, Terry, was said to be 'shocked and disappointed' that the trial would not conclude in a verdict. 'It's a difficult situation,' said Detective Chief Inspector Baldwin. 'My thoughts are with the victim of the sexual offences John Heald is alleged to have committed and of the family of Bei Carter, who will now not get closure from this process,' he said. 'I think, like myself and everyone else involved in the case, he (Mr Carter) is shocked and disappointed that he won't receive a conclusion to this trial. 'He has been here and listened to the evidence, he's very satisfied with the police investigation and he now needs to go away and consider the circumstances.' The detective said Heald's death ended the investigation into Mrs Carter's murder. He said: 'It was a complex investigation. I'm satisfied we did a thorough job of that. 'We brought the correct indictments to the crown court and that John Heald was responsible for the death of Bei Carter.'","John Heald, 53, was on trial for murder and rape at Hull Crown Court .

"The segregated water fountains and signs pointing African-Americans to the back entrances of movie theaters have long disappeared from the streets of the South. But in one small South Carolina city there still sits a war memorial that lists fallen World War I and II soldiers in two categories: 'white' and 'colored'. Greenwood mayor Welborn Adams has been trying to replace the bronze nameplate with plaques that represent the equality of his city today. But a state law and critics - of both races - has helped divide the city and made the mayor's fight much harder than he first expected. A war memorial honoring fallen soldiers from Greenwood county (pictured) separates the men into two categories: 'colored' and 'white' On two sides of the memorial, the names of fallen soldiers from Greenwood county who died during World War I and II are separated by race. Racial distinction is absent from the third side of the monument, which lists those who died during the Korean and Vietnam wars, because the military was no longer segregated. Last year the American Legion post, which owns the memorial, asked Adams if he could raise $15,000 privately to change the monument. Adams, who is white and Democratic-leaning, was so confident he would receive the money he took out a loan so the new plaques could be ready and revealed on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. And he had no trouble coming up with the payment. Forty-three donors, most of whom were white, gave money for the new memorial, and Adams likewise wrote a $1,000 check for the cause. But the mayor's troubles had only just begun. South Carolina's Confederate flag law forbids any historical monument erected by the state or local government from being relocated, removed, disturbed or altered without a two-thirds vote from the state's lawmakers. The law was created in 2000 after people worried the removal of the Confederate flag from the Statehouse dome would encourage the destruction of memorials and street and park names that honored Confederate generals. Opponents said they could use the law as grounds for having Adams arrested, a threat made just days before the MLK day ceremony, if he went forward with the new plaque. And after the city's lawyer told Adams his opponents were right about the law, the ceremony was halted. The mayor said he cried in his office. Greenwood Mayor Welborn Adams (pictured with the memorial) raised $15,000 in private donations to put new plaques on the monument, but critics and a state law are currently blocking his efforts . 'I wonder if some of the opposition is racism hiding behind history,' said Adams. Historians, both black and white, have argued that the plaques serve as an important reminder of the once-segregated U.S. military. Eric Williams, who spent 32 years as a historian with the U.S. Park Service and is white, said altering the monument would be altering 'its historical integrity.' Williams, one of the most vocal critics against the change, believes it would be better to add a small display next to the monument explaining why the names are segregated. Chad Williams of Brandeis University in Boston, who has extensively studied black soldiers in World War I, agreed that the additional sign would be much more powerful and historically accurate. 'I think it is important to acknowledge the specific context in how African-American soldiers had to serve in the military,' Williams said. And activist Joseph McGill equates talk about switching plaques to schools banning Mark Twain's 'Huckleberry Finn' because of the racially offensive language from the 1800s sprinkled throughout the book. McGill, who spends the night in old slave cabins to get attention to preserve them, said changing the monument 'could just spread the perception that segregation did not exist or wasn't that bad'. Opposition only heightened after the mayor was quoted saying, in a local newspaper story about the memorial, 'I think if history offends people it needs to be rewritten if possible.' Historians, both black and white, have argued that the plaques (pictured) serve as an important reminder of the once-segregated U.S. military and that changing them would hurt the memorial's 'historical integrity' The mayor later acknowledged he didn't choose his words carefully, and said he meant that while history doesn't change, the way a community presents itself does. A bill has been filed to change the Greenwood memorial and half of the members of the state Senate are listed as sponsors, but some legislators who helped craft the Confederate flag law are leery to bring the divisive issue up again. Republican Sen. John Courson, who has been in the Senate since 1985, said he would look at the bill but doesn't 'want to reopen the whole debate'. 'That was last century's battle.' Adams said he asked other South Carolina mayors and doesn't know of any other similar memorials in the state. Several historians also said they haven't heard of a monument where fallen soldiers are separated by race. Freelance journalist Will Moredock, who is trying to get South Carolina to remove the statue of a segregationist  from the Statehouse grounds, is one of the mayor supporters. 'Every generation has the right to choose the people and the causes it wishes to enshrine in its public places,' Moredock said. The  Confederate flag removed in 2000 is now in front of the the state's Capitol alongside a Confederate soldier monument. It remains a sore point for the NAACP and other black leaders. As for the old plaques, Adams had originally planed to put them in the county museum. For now they remain on the monument, as the new ones sit in a storage space in City Hall while the Legislature prepares to act. 'I am fully aware this is much tougher than I ever expected,' Adams said. 'But it's the right thing to do.' The state's Confederate flag law forbids any historical monument erected by the state or local government from being  altered without a two-thirds vote from state lawmakers. It was created in 2000 after people worried Confederate monuments (like the one pictured here) would be removed .","Monument in Greenwood, South Carolina, lists fallen of both world wars .

"Myuran Sukumaran's mother and sister have tearfully pleaded for him to be spared after they received official word he and Andrew Chan will be executed this month. It comes after the Australian drug smugglers had their second bid for clemency officially rejected on Wednesday, dashing their final hope of avoiding the firing squad. For two weeks, the families of Sukumaran and his co-ringleader in the 2005 Bali Nine plot, Chan, have walked silently in and out of Kerobokan jail for twice-daily visiting hours.

Australia's consul-general Majel Hind brought confirmation from Indonesian authorities on Friday that the execution will be carried out within three weeks. Sukumaran's mother Raji, brother Chintu and sister Brintha left the prison feeling distraught as they spoke with reporters waiting outside. Mrs Sukumaran pleaded for President Joko Widodo to spare her son and Chan. 'Please don't kill them, they are good children,' she said. Brintha cried as she begged for her older brother's life. 'Please don't kill my brother, please,' she said. 'He's rehabilitated and we love him so much. 'Please don't kill him, please. Please.'

'No one is listening to us, it's not fair,' she said. 'We don't have much time and he's scared. I can see it in his eyes, he's so scared.' Earlier, expatriate Lizzie Love, who assists in Sukumaran's art classes, left the prison with one of his self-portraits and a portrait of a prisoner named Maria to be donated to charity. The Filipina is ill and Sukumaran's paintings are funding her long-needed surgery. Ms Love said it was one in a long line of kind acts for his fellow inmates. 'I just implore the president to please consider his position,' she said. Mr Joko is refusing clemency to death row drug offenders regardless of their rehabilitation efforts.

Family members of Sukumaran leave the Kerobokan jail in Denpasar on Bali island on Friday . An application for a judicial review that would have canvassed Chan's chaplaincy efforts and Sukumaran's successful art school - as well as past errors of law - was rejected this week. But some of the inmates touched by the Sydney men have written their own appeals to Mr Joko. One of them, Richo Richardo, said Chan was a selfless man who had insisted on paying for his medical care when he had no money. 'If your honour Bapak President still insists on executing Andrew Chan, I, Richo Richardo, as an Indonesian citizen, am ready to replace Andrew Chan to be executed.'

"The price of a box of condoms has rocketed to £500 in Venezuela after an oil price slump led to sky-high inflation. The dire economic situation has led to shortages of basic supplies at supermarkets and protests on the streets - and now Venezuelans are struggling to get hold of contraception. With less condoms and birth control pills on the shelves, the price of protection still available has shot up, with boxes now costing 85 per cent of the average monthly salary in the South American nation. The price of a box of condoms has rocketed to £500 in Venezuela after an oil price slump led to sky-high inflation (file picture) CNN visited eight pharmacies in Caracas, finding that half did not stock condoms at all, while the other four had limited availability. Yuraima Bacher, a pharmacy manager, said: 'Can you believe it? It's been two weeks [since the last delivery of condoms]. Things have been slow since early January, and it's been the same thing so far this month,' Bacher said. Venezuelans have been forced to buy their contraception online, taking to Mercado Libre - a similar website to eBay - to purchase protection. One seller is offering boxes of 36 condoms for 4,760 bolivars - equivalent to just under £500. The average salary is around £590 a month. President Nicolas Maduro has been unable to meet demand for condoms despite having a new factory built . President Nicolas Maduro, who has been criticised for the county's 60 per cent rate of inflation, announced in June that the government was building a condom factory. Despite following through on his promise, consumers have complained that the contraceptives are not of good enough quality and supply is not meeting demand. Magdymar Leon, from the Venezuelan Association for an Alternative Sexual Education, said the lack of condoms could have lead to an increase in sexually transmitted infections. He said: 'What are the implications? One is that the individual doesn't have the means to control a decision to have children or not. That right is lost. 'On the other hand, the ability to protect oneself from sexually transmitted diseases is also lost.' Venezuela has one of the highest pregnancy rates in Latin America and has a 0.6 per cent HIV infection rate. In recent weeks, protests have gripped Caracas and opposition leaders have called for snap elections to tackle the crisis. Two top executives at Venezuela's largest drugstore were this week arrested as part of an investigation into what authorities say are illegal practices contributing to the country's chronic shortages. The attorney general's office says it detained Farmatodo executive president Pedro Angarita and vice president Agustin Alvarez over the weekend, and formally charged them on Wednesday with working to destabilise the country. Farmatodo said earlier this week that its actions are transparent and that its 167 stores nationwide have been inspected numerous times in recent months by the government. President  Maduro has blasted owners of major retail chains that he accuses of conspiring with opponents to wage an 'economic war' against his socialist government.","Box of condoms now costs £500 in Venezuela thanks to rocketing inflation .

"Michael Kopeski, 27, is alleged to have stolen a police car and taunted officers over its radio . A man allegedly stole a police car and taunted officers over the radio after they were called to a domestic dispute he was involved in. Officers were called to the Massachusetts home of Michael Kopeski's girlfriend at around 4am yesterday after she asked police to remove the 27-year-old from her premises. Sergeant John Delaney said at first Kopeski was cooperative with officers Shelley Whitley and Christopher Roberts, but that changed when he wanted to re-enter the property on Laurelton Street, Pine Point, to gather his possessions. Kopeski was then said to have called the officers 'pigs', before spitting on their patrol car. Sgt. Delaney said Kopeski then pulled on the driver's side door of the car which opened despite an automatic lock being engaged.  He then got in and drove away. One of the officers managed to open the passenger door of the vehicle and pepper spray Kopeski, but Sgt. Delaney told Masslive.com it had no effect on the 'possessed driver'. For the next 20 minutes Kopeski taunted police over the car's radio, saying things like 'You guys are boring, I am going to find crime'. He was also said to have disrupted radio transmissions as he drove around Springfield streets. Police boxed the vehicle in but Kopeski refused to surrender. Officers then broke a window to get into the vehicle and arrest him. Kopeski stole the patrol car from officer's who were called to his girlfriend's home on Laurelton Street, Pine Point, Massachusetts (pictured) Kopeski was said to have thrown punches at the officers, two of which were injured in the altercation, before he was subdued. Sgt Delaney said: 'Mr. Kopeski then got another ride in a police car, this time in the rear seat, cuffed'. He was later charged with larceny of a motor vehicle, failure to stop for police, four counts of assault and battery on a police officer and resisting arrest. Sgt. Delaney said such incidents are rare but not unheard of, saying 'It has happened before'.","Police were called to the home of Michael Kopeski's girlfriend at 4am .

"Two senior Blairites approached Alan Johnson last year to ask whether he would consider taking over from Ed Miliband, it emerged last night. Lord Mandelson and Alastair Campbell contacted the former Home Secretary in the autumn to see if he wanted to replace Mr Miliband as Labour leader, according to the Financial Times. Both men have been forced to deny they encouraged Mr Johnson to put himself forward as Labour leader when Mr Miliband's leadership hit rock bottom in November last year. Peter Mandelson and Alastair Campbell held talks with Alan Johnson amid growing speculation that he would take the helm of the party to prevent a second election defeat . Mr Johnson has ruled out ever standing for the Labour leadership, to the dismay of his many supporters in the party . The Financial Times reported that former Business Secretary Lord Mandelson and New Labour spin doctor Mr Campbell approached Mr Johnson to see whether he would be interested in replacing the hapless Mr Miliband as leader. According to one Labour MP, Mr Johnson gave an 'emphatic No' – as he has in public. But it was seen as a sign of the growing sense of desperation in the Labour party in the wake of Mr Miliband's disastrous party conference speech in which he forgot to mention the deficit. Mr Johnson served in the Cabinet for six years and was seen as a safe pair of hands, popular with the media and the public. After Mr Miliband won the Labour leadership he appointed Mr Johnson as shadow chancellor, but he remained in post for just three months, resigning after revelations about his wife having an affair. However, many still view the former postman and trade union leader as a possible caretaker leader if Mr Miliband's woeful personal ratings risked prevent Labour winning the election. Labour leader Ed Miliband has come under fresh pressure in recent days over mounting criticism from business leaders . Stuart Rose, former M&S chairman: 'Labour's attack this week on a major British business smacked of the destructive anti-business mood that went out of political fashion decades ago.' Lord Digby Jones, former Labour trade minister: 'It's a much bigger problem with business. I think that they're scraping the bottom of the barrel... they haven't got the support that New Labour used to have years ago.' Yo! Sushi founder Simon Woodroffe, who once appeared in a Labour party advert:  'You know it scares me. I was a Labour Party supporter during the Blair-Brown thing and I was a supporter because I am a believer that politics needs to make money, that UK PLC needs to be a profitable business, and I thought they were a good management team.' Pizza Express founder Luke Johnson: 'Take freezing energy prices – an example of how the Opposition are ignorant of the way markets and capitalism works.' Brent Hoberman, co-founder of Lastminute.com: 'Should Labour get elected then what we may well find is that it will be similar to what Hollande did in France, in that he sends businesses away and investment out of the country and then he does a U-turn and it's almost too late.' Charlie Mullins, founder Pimlico Plumbers: 'I'm one business owner who isn't going to keep quiet about the destructive power of having a business-hating government with Ed Miliband at the helm.' Boots chief Stefano Pessina said: 'If they acted as they speak, it would be a catastrophe. The problem is, would they act that way or not? One thing is to threaten and to shout, but it is completely different to be in charge and to manage the country day to day.' New Labour supporters were seen as being closer to Mr Miliband's brother David, but he stepped down as an MP after losing the leadership against to his brother. At least 40 Labour MPs are believed to have backed the abortive coup, which occurred weeks after the Labour leader's conference speech last autumn. The FT article said that the paper had learned that 'two Labour grandees — Lord Mandelson, the former business secretary, and Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former press chief — took soundings from Johnson to see whether he was prepared to take over. 'Alan gave an emphatic No,' says one Labour MP. Another senior party figure claimed that at least 40 MPs supported the abortive coup — others claim far more.' Tensions between Mr Miliband and New Labour grandees have been renewed in recent days, after losing the support of business leaders seen as crucial to Mr Blair's three election triumphs. However, Lord Mandelson today insisted he had not encouraged Mr Johnson to challenge Mr Miliband, but only asked if rumours about him standing were true. He said: 'As he is a good friend of mine, we talked about the press frenzy going on at the time and he said it was all nonsense. End of conversation, end of story.' A Labour spokesman for the Labour party said the story was 'false and misleading'. 'This story is nonsense,' he said. 'Both Peter Mandelson and Alastair Campbell have made it crystal clear to the FT that they spoke to Alan Johnson only to see if the newspaper rumours were correct. 'They were not sounding him out or encouraging him to stand but checking the accuracy of reports in the press. They discovered that those reports were false and misleading, just as is today's story in the FT.' But Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi said: 'Six months out from the General Election those at the highest levels of the Labour party were plotting to remove Ed Miliband. 'This just proves Ed Miliband is not up to the job of being Prime Minster and his own party knows it. Ed Miliband in Downing Street would spell chaos for Britain.' The leadership speculation comes at the end of a week when captains of industry and entrepreneurs have lined up to warn against a Labour victory. Business leaders credited with the success of well-known chains including Boots, M&S, Pizza Express and Lastminute.com have turned their fire on Labour in recent days, warning victory for Mr Miliband would plunge Britain into an economic catastrophe. Sir Charles Dunstone, who was one of 63 signatories to a letter of support for Labour in 2005, told the Financial Times the business community felt 'isolated' by Labour's shift to the left. 'As a business person I'm frightened of an environment where there isn't sufficient emphasis put on growing the economy to grow tax receipts to spend more money,' he said. However, Lord Levy, formerly Tony Blair's chief fundraiser who helped New Labour form close ties with business, said he was 'saddened' by the attacks on Mr Miliband. He insisted that he had not given up on Labour working with business under Mr Miliband and attempted to play down the damage caused by attacks from leaders of large firms and shadow chancellor Ed Balls's televised memory lapse over the name of the party's small business adviser Bill Thomas. The peer told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: 'I'm somewhat saddened that people like Sir Charles Dunstone, whom I have great respect for, has said what he has said. 'Ed Balls, obviously, no one likes to have a touch of amnesia and forgetting Bill Thomas's name was one of those things that happened. 'But really the key issue is where does Labour stand with business. Frankly I don't think any political party can ignore business, they have to work with business, they have to work with a broad spectrum of society.' Businesses will today be promised a £10billion boost by cutting red tape in the Conservative manifesto as the party seeks to exploit Labour’s damaging row with captains of industry. In an interview with the Daily Mail, business minister Matthew Hancock set out plans to cut red tape, saving firms an average of £2,000 a year. He also signalled the party is preparing to offer tax breaks to start-up companies taking on their first employees and further steps to rein in vexatious employment tribunal claims. Mr Hancock said the Tories would go into the election as ‘unashamedly pro-business and pro-enterprise’, committing to more deregulation. A review of each sector will take place this year if the Tories remain in power, and Whitehall departments made to implement a ‘one in, two out’ rule whenever they introduce any new regulation. His announcement came as Labour has been embroiled in a business row, after Ed Miliband turned on the boss of Boots when he expressed alarm at the prospect of the party regaining power.","Ex-Business Secretary and former spin doctor called Alan Johnson .

"A father trying to help his 16-year-old stepdaughter  was shot dead this morning by her boyfriend from the upstairs window of the teenage couple's Pennsylvania home. Jerred Price, 42, was killed on his stepdaughter's front lawn after Jerald Thompson, 18, took aim with a .22-caliber rifle from the second-floor. Police said Price was shot twice - once in the head. Jerald Thompson (pictured), 18, shot dead his girlfriend's stepfather Jerred Price, 42, from the upstairs window of the couple's home. Thompson fired at Price twice, including once in the head . Price, 42, and his ex-wife had gone to the home before 4am because his stepdaughter Logan called and asked to be picked up after she had a fight with Thompson. Logan had told them that Thompson was armed and she feared for the safety of the couple's seven-month old son, police said, according to the Observer-Reporter. City Detective Daniel Stanek said Price and Thompson argued inside the house before the stepfather went outside and stood with his ex-wife and Logan in the courtyard, ready to leave. Thompson continued to argue with Price from the upstairs window before he fired the two shots. Investigators are unsure if Price, who was pronounced dead at the scene, was 'facing the apartment or walking away' during the shooting. The baby was in a different upstairs bedroom with Thompson's mother, who also lives in the house, when the shooting occurred. Price's cousin Eadrik Davenport called the violence 'senseless'. 'It didn't have to happen,' he said. He spoke highly of the man who was like a brother, saying he was not surprised Price had tried to help his ex-wife and stepdaughter. Thompson has been charged with homicide and reckless endangerment. He is being held in the Washington County jail without bond. Price had gone to pick up his stepdaughter early this morning from the couple's Pennsylvania home (pictured) after she had a fight with Thompson and feared for her safety and that of their seven-month old son .","Jerald Thompson shot Jerred Price, 42, twice, including once in the head .

"Shocking videos purporting to show two women being gang raped have been released by a campaign group in India in a bid to name and shame the attackers. The graphic footage, originally filmed and then shared on the messaging app WhatsApp, has been edited to obscure the victims' identities but the men caught on camera smiling while carrying out the alleged attacks remain visible. A movement called #shametherapistcampaign has now been launched in what is the latest attempt to fight back against repeated incidents of extreme sexual violence towards women in India. Scroll down for video . The video released by Mrs Krishnan purports to show this man being filmed while carrying out an attack . In a second video, the faces of five different men seen in the footage have been circled by Mrs Krishnan . The videos and images of the alleged attackers were released by Sunitha Krishnan through her organisation Prajwala India, a women's rights NGO based in Hyderabad, India. MailOnline is not able to verify the veracity of the footage, but the first purports to show a group of five men allegedly raping a woman and smiling while the attack is carried out. In the second, unrelated video, only one man is pictured but a second person is present and holding the camera. The content of both videos is too graphic to be published. Both were originally posted on YouTube only to be removed after breaching the site's terms and conditions. Only 30 minutes after the campaign was launched on Indian national television, rocks were thrown through the window of Mrs Krishnan's vehicle in an apparent attempt to intimidate her. India has faced intense scrutiny over its efforts to curb violence against women following the fatal gang rape of a medical student on a bus in Delhi in 2012. The 23-year-old died after she was raped then tossed out of the moving vehicle. Despite receiving treatment at a Singapore hospital, she died two weeks later. Mrs Krishnan wrote on her Facebook page that her #shametherapistcampaign was born when a concerned man forwarded her the videos after they were sent to him on the messaging service WhatsApp. Pictured is one of the men caught smiling on camera during the alleged gang rape in India . The faces of two more men from the same footage, who women's rights campaigners are attempting to identify through the release of the video . She wrote: 'Some sick pathetic human beings are sending videos of rape on 'WhatsApp'. If any of you are getting such videos please report... We will use the same tool to shame and punish the rapist. 'On checking the videos I found it was... a true video which some sicko while raping had recorded it - in all probability to threaten and intimidate the victim.' She said the original videos were eight minutes and four minutes long, but she edited them to protect the identity of the victim while shaming the alleged attackers. 'We have to stand up now to end this. These rapists have to be traced, shamed and punished. Lets make this is a national campaign, for this is our chance to make our world more safe.' Pictured is the fifth man caught on camera in the second attack, carrying out what Ms Krishnan called a 'pathetic' sexual attack . At the official launch of her campaign, Mrs Krishnan told Indian broadcaster NDTV the videos were recorded about six months ago. 'Ten seconds into the video, I was overcome. I had to stop as I needed to throw up.' It comes just months after a Japanese student was allegedly gang raped by five men who kidnapped her and subjected her to more than a month of sexual abuse in eastern India. The 23-year-old woman was lured to a house near a Buddhist shrine in Bihar state in November by a tour guide, where she says she was raped by five men. After a month, the men are said to have taken her for medical treatment in a nearby town where she escaped and made her way to Calcutta. A police spokesman said: 'We are aware of the videos and are looking to identify both the victim and the offenders.'","Horrifying videos purporting to show two separate gang rapes released .

"A veterans group has claimed to have uncovered potentially significant information about the accused killer of 'American Sniper' Chris Kyle. The Warfighter Foundation alleged that Eddie Ray Routh, 27, the Marine veteran accused of murdering Navy SEAL Kyle two years ago, never saw combat nor experienced traumatic situations during his time serving overseas,TheBlaze reported on Thursday. As yet, there is no conclusive evidence to back up the claims made by the group. Routh, whose trial for murder is expected to start next week in Stephenville, Texas, is alleged to have suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when he shot married father-of-two Kyle, 38, and fellow Navy SEAL and father-of-one Chad Littlefield, 35. The incident occurred at a remote shooting range outside of Chalk Mountain, Texas, on February 2, 2013. Scroll down for video . Chris Kyle (pictured) was helping Eddie Routh with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when he and fellow Navy SEAL Chad Littlefield were killed. A veterans group claims that Routh might not have even had PTSD . Eddie Ray Routh (pictured left during service and right in custody) served in Iraq in 2007 before leaving the Marines in 2010. There are now claims he never experienced traumatic events that would lead to PTSD . The Warfighter Foundation has been reaching out to service personnel and verterans that dealt directly with Routh through its Facebook page as it attempts to gather evidence as to whether Routh had PTSD . Kyle, who wrote the book 'American Sniper' and is played in the movie of the same name by Bradley Cooper, had been contacted by Routh's mother to help her son deal with his PTSD. The trip to the shooting range for target practice had been a part of that service. Routh served as a small arms technician in Iraq before leaving the Marines in 2010. The Warfighter Foundation, a nonprofit with the stated goal of empowering combat veterans and their families, is gathering evidence as to whether Routh ever suffered from PTSD in the first place, citing a lack of exposure to traumatic situations. 'Basically, we are trying to conclude what led up over the course of [Routh's] military service that led to February 2, 2013. None of us believe it was PTSD,' Spencer Walker, board president of the Warfighter Foundation and Marine combat veteran, told TheBlaze. The Warfighter Foundation has been reaching out to service personnel and veterans that dealt directly with Routh through its Facebook page. In an earlier Facebook post dated January 25, the veterans group laid out what they claim to have uncovered through the Freedom of Information Act concerning Routh's service. The full text reads: . The Warfighter Foundation laid out on their Facebook page what they claim to have uncovered following an examination of Routh's service record. As yet there is no conclusive evidence to support their claims . 'Eddie Routh served one tour in Iraq in 2007, at Balad Air Base (the 2nd largest U.S. installation in Iraq), with no significant events. No combat experience. Let me say that again, he NEVER SAW COMBAT or any aspect of traumatic events associated with a combat deployment (i.e. incoming mortar or rocket fire). He never left the base, EVER. 'He held a non-combat arms occupation of 2111 (Small Arms Repairer/ Technician or more commonly referred to as an Armorer). Balad Air Base had a Pizza Hut, 24 hour Buger King, Subway, Popeye's, Baskin Robbins, movie theater, and even a miniature golf course. It even had a strictly enforced 10-mile per hour speed limit! What a dangerous place... 'His tour was comparable to being on a base in southern California, only with MANY more luxuries that were catered to the morale and welfare of the troops who occupied it. He was known to be a drug user and a below average performer while in the Marine Corps. 'This has NOTHING to do with PTSD. He was an individual with psychological problems that were not associated with his service. So don't give me that bleeding heart bulls**** that he was a veteran suffering from PTSD.'

Opening statements in the trial are expected on Wednesday, February 11. Routh is pleading not guilty by reason of insanity. Routh's attorney has said that the popularity of both the movie 'American Sniper' and Kyle's memoir of the same name, will be an issue when it comes to jury selection. The book and movie cover Kyle's four tours in Iraq before retiring from the military in 2009. He is recognized for having made the highest number of confirmed kills in American military history. The movie, which has been nominated for six Academy Awards, broke box office records in January.

"The shimmering blue surface of a giant Nevada lake has concealed a sunken mystery for nearly 70 years, which a drought parching the southwest may soon help reveal. Beneath the waters of man-made Lake Mead lies a B-29 bomber that went down carrying a top-secret missile defense system that may have actually caused the crash. The aircraft was known as the Superfortress and was the same model as the Enola Gay and Bockscar planes that dropped atomic bombs on Japan. A diver at the wreck of the B-29. Recreational divers will soon be able to explore it for themselves . The bomber went down carrying a top-secret missile defense system that may have actually caused the crash . With Lake Mead at record low levels, the National Park Service intends to grant permits for diving the bomber . It crashed in 1948 as it flew over Lake Mead testing a sun-powered missile guidance system. For decades it lay at a depth of 300 feet in the man-made lake that was formed by the construction of the Hoover Dam, but the drought has lowered water levels to the point where the plane is just 110 feet down, well within the range of recreational divers. Better-equipped divers, using a special helium-rich gas mixture, for example, have been secretly exploring the crash site since 2001, when it was first discovered in the giant lake's Overton Arm section. But now it is set to become possible for any recreational diver to reach the wreck, perhaps the secrets of the sunken plan can be fully revealed. 'It would be amazing to see it,' Curtis Snaper, of Sin City Scuba in nearby Las Vegas, told Fox News. 'There's a lot of history there. The site would be right up there with any shipwreck for a diver.' The B-29 at the bottom of Lake Mead was one of the last of its kind to be built. The US Army Air Forces, which would later become the US Air Force, received it days after Japan surrendered, on Sept 2, 1945. Two years later, the plane was stripped of its defensive armament and was turned over to the military's Upper Atmosphere Research Project. When it went down on June 21, 1948, the plane and its five-man crew were testing a secret ballistic-missile guidance system known as a 'sun-tracker,' according to the blog War is Boring. The highly-classified device, allegedly mounted in a dorsal dome atop the bomber's fuselage, allowed a missile to get its elevation and orientation from sighting the sun. Testing it required the B-29's crew to repeatedly ascend to 35,000 feet, then drop to just 100 feet above the lake. But, according to the blog, the lake's surface reflected the sun, and may have caused Captain Robert Madison to lose depth perception. The wreck was discovered in 2001 in Lake Mead's Overton Arm section, accessible to better-equipped divers . This field drawing shows how the B-29 has come to rest on the bottom of the man-made lake . The aircraft was the same model as the Enola Gay and Bockscar planes that dropped atomic bombs on Japan . The plane skimmed into the lake at 230 miles per hour and while the crew escaped on life rafts, the plane dropped to the murky depths. Recreational scuba divers have been officially banned by the National Park Service from exploring the site because of the dangers associated with such depths. But with Lake Mead at record low levels, the federal agency intends to grant permits for diving the bomber, beginning in April. It was not simply the danger to divers that prompted the Park Service to protect it from mistreatment and to prevent recreational divers from going down to the wreckage site. The agency is also concerned that weekend warriors could damage the wreck. In 2002, it sent a remote-controlled submarine down to explore the wreckage, and discovered ropes and lights from previous dives. A year later, technical divers sent down by the Parks Service found signs of damage and looting. In 2007, the agency allowed two licensed dive operators to lead guided scuba tours of the site, but demand was limited. Plunging water levels have made the site much more accessible, and likely much cheaper, for recreational scuba divers, although they would still have to be accompanied by approved guides. The Parks Service plans to offer a two-year, commercial-use permit allowing guides to take up to 100 divers per year down to the wreck. 'We have had people express an interest over the years,' Christie Vanover, a spokesman for Lake Mead National Recreation Area said to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. 'We think this is the best option, and it provides a business opportunity.'","Aircraft, known as the Superfortress, crashed into Lake Mead in June 1948 .

"A multimillionaire car dealer is facing a third murder trial in connection with the disappearance of his estranged wife in 2001 - after two previous convictions were overturned. Prosecutors described  businessman Calvin Harris from upstate New York  as callous and controlling on Thursday as he returned to court for the beginning of the case. The 53-year-old has continually insisted he did not kill Michele Harris, 35, who vanished after leaving her waitressing job on the night of September 11 - the day of the terrorist attacks. Prosecutors have no body, no murder weapon and a largely circumstantial case, but Tioga County District Attorney Kirk Martin told jurors that Harris, 'exercised the ultimate act of control' during a bitter divorce - from which his wife could have claimed half of his $4million fortune. Another trial: Calvin Harris walks into the Schoharie County Courthouse in upstate New York to begin his third murder trial linked to the disappearance of his estranged wife in September, 2001 . Victim: He insists he did not kill Michele Harris, who vanished after leaving her waitressing job on the night of September 11, 2001 . 'Who had the motive to kill Michele? The defendant,' Martin said during opening statements. 'Who had the opportunity to kill Michele? The defendant. Who went on with their life as if Michele wasn't coming back? The defendant.' Harris' lawyer, Bruce Barket, is set to make his opening remarks Monday. Prosecutors have argued Harris killed his wife at their remote, 200-acre Southern Tier estate, where they slept in separate bedrooms. But defense lawyers contend prosecutors failed to provide a theory for how he could have killed her at the house they shared with their young children and then disposed of her body within the prosecution's time frame. Support: Harris is pictured with his children, (from left) Taylor, 20, Jenna, 17, Cayla, 19, and Tanner, 15. The four teenagers have said they believe their father is innocent of killing their mother . Family: They are pictured with their children, who were between two and seven when she went missing . 'The most outrageous thing that happened is the prosecution ignores the real evidence of who actually committed this crime,' defense attorney Bruce Barket said outside court. 'It is shocking in some ways. They're going to pursue Cal no matter what.' Harris smiled and talked with his four children before court convened Thursday. They sat behind him at the trial. Michele Harris worked as a waitress in 2001 as the couple was divorcing. Prosecutors contend that her estranged husband struck her after she returned from work to their home about 35 miles northwest of Binghamton on either the night of Sept. 11 or early the next morning. Her empty minivan was found by the family's baby sitter around 7am September 12 at the bottom of the couple's quarter-mile driveway. Later that day, Harris told police they could search his home and his vehicles, according to court papers. A prosecution expert later testified that small amounts of Michele's blood were found in the kitchen and garage of the house, some of it cleaned up. Prosecutors argue the blood splatters supported the theory that Calvin Harris hit his wife with a blunt object, imperfectly cleaned up and buried her somewhere in the woods. Defense attorneys have argued that there was extremely small volume of blood and the age of the stains could not be determined. By his side: Harris, pictured with Jenna, left, and Cayla, right, is currently out on bail after his conviction was overturned for the second time in 2012. He had previously been convicted of murder in 2007 and 2009 . Emotional: In 2014, they appeared with their father as they appealed for information about the disappearance . It took a jury four hours to return a guilty verdict in 2007. Harris put his head down in court and sobbed, saying 'Oh my God. Oh my God.' One day after the verdict, a local farmhand came forward to say he saw Michele Harris and a man in his mid-20s at the end of their driveway at about 5:30am on September 12, 2001. With that information, Harris' lawyers won him a new trial. The 2009 conviction in that trial was thrown out by New York's top court in 2012. The Court of Appeals cited trial errors including the judge's handling of hearsay testimony and a prospective juror who acknowledged having a pre-existing opinion. 'I didn't have any involvement in Michele's disappearance,' Harris said during a news conference last year. 'I would never hurt the mother of my children, and I would never do anything to hurt them.' Jury selection for the third trial finished this week in Schoharie County, more than 100 miles northeast of the Harris home in Spencer. Defense lawyers had argued for a change of venue, saying Harris couldn't get a fair trial where he was twice convicted.

"More than half of university-aged students have admitted to watching porn to help them find out more about sex. Some 60 per cent of 2,500 people questioned said they learned more about intercourse by watching scenes online. A further 40 per cent questioned said watching porn online helped their understanding of sex - despite three quarters saying that porn provides unrealistic expectations, the research carried out by the National Union of Students revealed. The majority of university students are getting their sex education from watching porn (posed by model) Only a third of students said they felt that they could practically apply the knowledge taught in their sex and relationships lessons to real life. The same amount also admitted that they did not feel their SRE lessons helped their confidence, calling into question whether there needs to be changes made to the curriculum. The research found a 'real life' education is absent in the classroom as SRE is treated like a science lesson with puberty, contraception, sexual health, bodies and anatomy listed as the top subjects covered. Consent was never touched upon for two thirds, with relationships covered for less than half, and a fifth of students say they have not discussed lesbian, gay or transgender relationships in class. More than a third felt their SRE did not rate positively on equality and diversity. Psychologist Dr Arthur Cassidy said there are worrying issues with students using porn as their main source of sex education. He added: 'Exposure to all aspects of pornography can become addictive, destroy sexually healthy relationships and encourage sexual aggression in both genders. 'Porn is practically ubiquitous and easy fix. The accessibility. anonymity and affordability of online sex and hard core pornography has profound potential to create long-term chronically deficient sexual relationships, even among students.' Despite many students saying that they found porn to be a good source of sex education they also agreed it leaves them with unrealistic expectations . He continued: 'It is imperative that SRE is fully acceptable by all leading political parties, but more so, that we do not make hasty reactions to one major study. 'This sensitive issue requires fresh thinking and knows what are the most appropriate questions to ask and replace the full stops by question marks. 'Compulsive porn can destroy emotional intelligence and other aspects of self identity at a time in student life when 19-year-old men especially are trying to negotiate their identity through life.' NUS Vice President Colum McGuire said: 'We now urge all political parties to commit to statutory SRE in their general election manifestos, and accept that simple biology just won't cut it. 'Sex is not a science lesson. People are being left with gaps in their education. Inadequate SRE puts young people at risk. I find it alarming that sexual partners are listed as a top SRE source by our respondents. 'Consider this in light of the fact that consent was never even raised for two thirds of respondents. SRE is failing millions. NUS runs consent workshops on campuses across the country, covering a vital aspect of SRE that this government misses. 'The current system almost completely ignores LGBT relationships. In a country where we passed an equal marriage bill, this is the height of hypocrisy. 'Students are having to look outside the education system to find any information that will help them learn more about SRE in real life.'","Survey of 2,500 was carried out by National Union of Students .
33% said they did not find sex education lessons helpful .
Expert Dr Arthur Cassidy says using porn this way can be damaging ."
"Lawyers for the mommy blogger accused for killing her 5-year-old son with an overdose of salt tried to portray her as loving and concerned using internet activity and text message conversations around the time of the boy's death. Lacey Spears of Chestnut Ridge, New York is currently on trial for the murder of her son Garnett, who died of sodium poisoning last year. Prosecutors introduced cell phone activity to the jury on Thursday, arguing that searches about 'dangers of high sodium' and 'hypernatremia' carried out nine days before her son's death proves she planned the attack. Lacey Spears appeared in court on Thursday in the murder trial of her 5-year-old son Garnett who died of salt poisoning last year. Pictured above in court on Tuesday . Jurors were shown pictures of Garnett (right) for the first time on Thursday . But Spears' attorneys told the jury that the searches were evidence that Spears loved her child, and wanted to know what was wrong with him. They also pointed to a text message Spears sent right after her son died, on January 25, which read:  'I love him!!! He's my entire world, my soul!!!!! I lived for him!!!' They said Spears was so torn up about the loss of her son, that she googled different ways to commit suicide including by overdose of sleeping pills and self-injecting insulin. Thursday's court session also marked the first time that jurors were shown pictures of little Garnett, showing the blonde-haired blue-eyed boy looking healthy, eating and painting, just two weeks before his death. The most recent picture shown of the boy to the court was taken on January 25, 2014 in the hospital with his eyes closed and jaw slack. Garnett's aunt, Lacey's sister Becky, wiped tears from her eyes as she saw the pictures in court, according to The Journal News. During the next court session, jurors are expected to be shown surveillance footage from the hospital which shows Spears taking her son to the bathroom and holding his stomach tube which prosecutors claim she used to feed him the massive quantities of salt. At one point in the as-yet-seen video, Garnett apparently screams as he lies down with his mother looking over him 'like a scientific experiment'. During opening statements on Tuesday,  Assistant District Attorney Doreen Lloyd said Spears  researched, planned, carried out and tried to cover up the killing of her son. Spears, Lloyd said, calmly 'watched and waited' for the poisoning to take effect, summoning help only after he began writhing and retching, a prosecutor said on Tuesday. Defense lawyer Stephen Riebling told the jurors there are no eyewitnesses and no direct evidence that the 27-year-old Spears poisoned her son. He added: 'There is no evidence in this case that legitimately answers the question ""Why?'' Lacey's attorneys said in court on Thursday that text message conversations prove she was a loving and caring mother who didn't poison her own son. Pictured in court on Tuesday . Riebling also appeared to blame the hospital, in the New York suburbs near the Spearses' Chestnut Ridge home, noting it was only there that a high sodium level was detected. The defense lawyer said the prosecution case was 'riddled with reasonable doubt.' The Spearses lived in Chestnut Ridge at the time of Garnett's death. Lacey Spears moved to Kentucky afterward and was living there when she was arrested. Garnett's death ended a short life filled with doctor and hospital visits that his mother tirelessly documented in thousands of postings on Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and a blog. Many of the postings will be used in evidence, along with Spears' online research into the dangers of sodium in children and hospital records from New York, Florida and Spears' native Alabama. Also in evidence is a feeding bag prosecutors believe was used to hold the salt — and which they say she tried to hide after Garnett's death. Defense attorneys have insisted that there will be no mention of Munchausen by proxy, a disorder in which caretakers secretly harm children to win sympathy. Some experts believe that disorder fits Spears' actions.","Lacey Spears has been accused of murdering her 5-year-old son Garnett with an overdose of salt while he was hospitalized last year .

"With more than a week until 50 Shades of Grey is released in cinemas, an astonishing 2.75 million tickets have already been sold worldwide. But it isn't just cinemas who are hoping to make a killing from the film, which stars British talent Jamie Dornan, 32, as Christian Grey and up-and-coming star Dakota Johnson, 25, as the naive Anastasia Steele. Companies selling everything from cakes to babygros are also hoping to cash in, as are firms flogging lingerie, sex toys and even cook books. Scroll down for video . Terrifying: Among the many saleable tributes to Christian Grey is this edible 'homage' to Jamie Dornan . Coming soon: Ticket sales have already topped 2.75 million - with more than a week to go before the release . But while some errs on the side of tasteful, other products are less likely to have fans reaching for their wallets. Among the strangest is a cake modelled on Dornan, which comes complete with a sugar towel and a brooding frown. Part of a special 50 Shades of Cake collection at the Sugarcraft Cake Decorating Show in Manchester, liquorice whips, edible masks and sugar knickers are also available. Just as bizarre is 50 Shades of Chicken, a cook book created by the brains behind parody Twitter account, 50 Sheds of Grey. The book, which promises 'memorable tips' and 'revealing photographs', is purportedly written by F.L Fowler and includes such tempting recipes as 'Dripping Thighs' and 'Mustard Spanked Chicken'. And it's by no means the only one. Other authors hoping to cash in include E.L James herself, who has given her seal of approval to a range of racy brown leather whips. Spot the difference! The Jamie Dornan inspired cake bears a striking resemblance to ET . Homage: Dornan, pictured at the 50 Shades of Grey Fan First screening, is the inspiration for many a product . Racy: His cake incarnation boasts a towel, an impressive six-pack and an oddly sculpted face . Money spinner: The film, which stars Dornan and Dakota Johnson, is being jumped on by companies . The high-end range, made by upmarket lingerie brand Coco de Mer, includes whips, handcuffs, a flogger and even a mask, although with prices starting at £40, they don't come cheap. James, who has made millions from her novels, has also endorsed another sex toy range, albeit a significantly cheaper version, made by erotic retailer LoveHoney. She has also backed several lingerie collections, including a Christmas-themed 50 Shades of Grey range produced by supermarket Tesco. But Tesco is not the only underwear seller to cash in on the phenomenon. Swedish label Kappa and kinky knicker shop Ann Summers have also produced collections, as has plus-size retailer J.D Williams. The latter's efforts, which come bearing the slogan 'We're Over 50 Shades of Grey' is aimed at the 'mature' woman and features a mixture of lace pants and shape-wear. Bizarre: One of the more unusual tributes is this cook book, entitled: 50 Shades of Chicken . Racy: Author E.L James has put her name to this expensive collection of brown leather sex toys . Expensive: Launched last week by Coco de Mer, it starts at £40 and includes leather handcuffs . Cheap and cheerful: James has also put her name to this low-cost LoveHoney range of sex toys . But while the deluge of underwear and sex toys will come as no surprise, other products aimed at 50 Shades of Grey fans just might. Particularly toe-curling is the 50 Shades of Grey teddy bear which comes dressed in a Christian Grey inspired suit and carries a set of handcuffs. According to makers The Vermont Teddy Bear Company, the $89.99 (£59) soft toy boasts 'smouldering' grey eyes and sports a 'satin' tie similar to that worn by Jamie Dornan in the film. And the bear isn't the only child-friendly product to be given a 50 Shades makeover. Perhaps the most excruciating of all is the set of erotic novel inspired baby wear appearing on US website, Etsy. Bearing such slogans as 'I'm a product of 50 Shades of Grey' and 'My Mommy Pretends Christian Grey is My Daddy', the ensembles are designed to cater for children aged between three months and a year. Over 50 Shades: This lingerie collection is aimed at women over the age of 50 and includes lace pants . Risque: Naughty knicker shop Ann Summers has also leapt on the bandwagon with this racy collection . Tasteful: One of the more tasteful tributes is Bluebella's 'Black Label' collection, also inspired by the film . Strange: The Vermont Teddy Bear Company has created a £59 bear, once again inspired by Dornan . Men too can buy into the 50 Shades of Grey look, courtesy of a £24.99 silk tie sold as part of the 'official pleasure collection', which is sold through LoveHoney and also includes a £15 roll of bright red 'bondage tape'. The film is also making its mark on women's wardrobes, with companies rushing out all-grey capsule collections, among them Spottedonceleb and Quilit. It has even made inroads into travel and restaurants, with a 15 Shades of Bacon burger briefly offered by The Custom House in Barnstaple for £15. Still available is the Fifty Shades of Gin cocktail currently served at the Rib Room in London's Knightsbridge, which combines 41 gins, including damson and sloe varieties, with seven types of fruit and Fever Tree Tonic Water. Dressing the part: Spottedonceleb and Quilit are among the brands to pay tribute to 50 Shades of Grey . Tasty: The Rib Room in Knightsbridge has launched an 'alluring' £16 cocktail called 50 Shades of Gin . 'I’m thrilled to introduce such an alluring cocktail,' quipped creator Michele Caggianese at the launch of the £16 drink: . 'Created from British ingredients, [it is] served for pleasure. A labour of love, Fifty Shades of Gin is a unique cocktail to be savoured.' But while £16 is affordable to most, fans with the cash to splash can travel to Seattle where the apartment used by Christian Grey in the film is available to rent. The luxury apartment costs £171 per night to rent but was the setting from one of the film's most famous scenes, in which Anastasia wakes up in bed with Christian for the very first time. Also on offer for travelling fans is the 'No Grey Area' package offered by the Edgewater Hotel, also in Seattle, which costs £9,346 and includes use of an Audi R8 Spyder, a helicopter tour and a discreetly located copy of the Kama Sutra. Live like Mr Grey: This Seattle apartment is available for £171 a night on Air BnB . Expensive: One Seattle hotel is offering a £9,000 50 Shades package that includes a helicopter ride . No Grey: The Edgewater Hotel's deal also includes a discreet copy of the Kama Sutra and the use of an Audi .","Companies are cashing in on the upcoming 50 Shades of Grey film .

"A paediatrician who worked in the hospital at the centre of the Jimmy Savile scandal has been found guilty of a series of rapes and sexual assaults against seriously ill young girls. Dr Michael Salmon, now 80, was today convicted of nine indecent assaults and two rapes carried out against six girls aged 11 to 18, between 1973 and 1988. Reading Crown Court heard that he raped one girl at his home after she went to him aged 16 for treatment, telling her 'one good turn deserves another.' The jury was also told he carried out assaults in his consulting room at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Buckinghamshire, while the girls' parents waited just yards away behind a screen. Dr Michael Salmon, 80, has been convicted of nine indecent assaults and two rapes during the 1970s and 80s while he was working at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, which is at the centre of the Jimmy Savile scandal . Salmon raped one 16-year-old after she came to his house looking for treatment, and assaulted other girls as their parents sat just yards away behind a scree (Salmon arrives at court, left, and wife Ann pictured right) The prosecution told how he fondled girls' breasts while claiming to check for cancer, and carried out intimate examinations  without gloves after patients came to him complaining of migraines. He was also found guilty of two rapes at his home when a 16-year-old he had seen regularly for stomach problems came to him asking for an abortion after fearing she was pregnant. The court was previously told that after administering a painful procedure to get rid of the child he then held her down and raped her while she cried and screamed in pain. The victim recalled feeling 'dizzy' and 'light-headed' as she was asked to lie back on the bed for a check-up. Salmon then told her 'one good turn deserves another' before attacking her. 'I don't remember much - I just closed my eyes until it was over,' she told the court. 'I couldn't take in what he meant and then he dropped his trousers and I see he has got nothing on apart from his shirt and he's coming towards me, he's on me,' she said, her voice breaking as she told how she screamed, 'No.' After the attack he dropped her at a bus stop where she caught a bus home and bled on her white summer dress during the journey. He then raped the same girl a second time after telling her to come back because she may have been pregnant with twins. Salmon was jailed and struck off the medical register in 1991 (pictured) after admitting three counts of indecent assault against young female patients . Michael Salmon's wife Ann leaves Reading Crown Court after her husband was found guilty of two rapes and nine indecent assaults against young girls . The jury found him guilty of both rapes, but found him not guilty of using an instrument to procure and abortion. He was acquitted of one further count of rape against one victim, and two indecent assaults against a further teenager. The abuse concerned the time Salmon was a leading paediatrician at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, with much of it taking place within the hospital itself. Allegations of sex assaults carried out by another doctor at the hospital were also recently investigated by Thames Valley Police until it was discovered he had died. An NHS report into historic abuse carried out at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in light of the Savile allegations was delayed last year to gather new evidence and has yet to be published. The jury of seven men and five women had heard how Salmon would examine young girls in a consulting room, when their parents were placed behind a screen or asked to leave the room. He would touch teenage girls' breasts, with one woman speaking of being shown how to check herself for breast cancer, and another saying Salmon 'squeezed' her nipples. Other patients said he subjected them to unnecessary vaginal examinations when they went to him for treatment for conditions like migraines. One patient recalled being asked to do balancing exercises with her top off before being subjected to an unnecessary intimate examination. Salmon had already been struck off the medical register after he admitted three counts of indecent assault against young female patients in 1991. He was the first person to be charged under Operation Yewtree for offences at the hospital when eight women came forward in the wake of the Savile scandal. Miranda Moore QC, prosecuting, said there is 'no suggestion that this defendant abused a young female patient in concert with Jimmy Savile'. 'It’s simply that these allegations relate to a time when the other things were happening.' Prolific child abuser Savile is believed to have carried out his worst offending at the hospital, where he had his own office with the Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville Hospital Trust charity in 1981. The court previously heard how Salmon thought he was 'bomb-proof' because no one would believe a child over him. During a police interview after he was arrested in 2013, Salmon described his victims as 'gold-diggers' and fantasists. He said: 'As we know, teenagers are unreliable witnesses, their sexual fantasies often take over, become reality and I think you better explore that. This is nothing to do with... I've never done that.' Defending Salmon, barrister Sarah Jones previously said he had been 'hauled over coals,' just as he was rebuilding his life. She said: 'He's become a scapegoat for a time when too many people died before the winds of change blew.' But Ms Moore said: 'This isn't a quick fumble in a car park, this is a concerted and repeated attacks on young women. He appears to have a total lack of understanding that what he did was wrong. Miranda Moore QC, prosecuting, said there was no suggestion that Salmon had abused patients with Savile, but the offences had occurred around the same time . 'In his view, it's incredibly silly. His own behaviour indicates a total lack of moral compass.' She added: 'This is a case about trust. That trust is left in the hands of medical professionals every day. These girls weren't just ill with a snuffle or a cut knee, these girls were really ill. 'They were vulnerable, young, entrusted and trusting. That's what gave him opportunity. That trust was breached by Mr Salmon.' Dressed in a smart navy suit with a blue pocket handkerchief,  Salmon showed no emotion as he listened to the verdicts being read out. Adrian Foster, chief prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service Thames and Chiltern said: 'Michael Salmon has been convicted today of offences which are particularly shocking due to the abuse of his position as a doctor taking advantage of the female patients in his care. 'His crimes were extremely traumatic for his victims, who should have expected his support rather than this gross betrayal of their trust. 'Michael Salmon used his status to molest these vulnerable young girls and women who felt unable to complain as he was a doctor, and many of whom only bravely came forward after seeing other cases in the media. 'I hope they now feel that justice has been done.' Detective Sergeant Malcolm Wheeler, from the child abuse investigation unit at Thames Valley Police, said: 'Salmon was a prolific sexual offender who abused his position of power in order for his own sexual gratification. 'As a consultant paediatrician, he preyed on young girls who had been referred to him for a variety of health issues. 'They trusted him, they believed him, because he was a doctor and they thought he was trustworthy. 'On a number of occasions, he carried out unnecessary internal examinations on young girls. 'Although they felt uncomfortable at this, they didn't feel able to tell anyone because they believed the examinations must have been necessary. 'Some of the offences were committed while the child's parent was just outside the room.' He added that he has 'no further concerns' about hospitals in Buckinghamshire but added more women have come forward with historic allegations against Salmon since the beginning of the trial. Salmon has been remanded in custody to await sentencing next week.","Michael Salmon, 80, found guilty of two rapes and nine indecent assaults .

"A longtime friend who visited To Kill a Mockingbird author Harper Lee the day before the world learned she would release a sequel says she seemed perfectly sound of mind. Historian Wayne Flynt said communicating with Lee often involves shouting so she can hear. But he dismissed theories that Lee is senile and was manipulated into publishing the decades-old manuscript. 'As late as yesterday, she was quite lucid, because I was there talking with her,' Flynt told AL.com of the woman he calls Nelle, which is her first name. Scroll down for video . 'I'm happy as hell': Harper Lee's publisher has released a statement slamming claims she has been coerced into publishing Go Set A Watchman, the sequel to To Kill A Mockingbird, 60 years after it was written . He said the 88-year-old discusses the books of C.S. Lewis, reads with a magnifying machine and can crack jokes. Flynt visited with Lee on Monday at the assisted living facility where she lives in her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama. That was a day before HarperCollins Publishers announced the publication of 'Go Set a Watchman.' Flynt said Lee did not mention the new book during the visit. 'I didn't know a thing about it. I don't think any of her closest friends, and I know most of them, knew about it either,' he told AL.com. His words comes as Harper Lee's biographer, who suggested the novelist had been coerced into releasing a To Kill A Mockingbird sequel, changed his mind. Charles J Shields was among a throng of literary figures to suggest the reclusive 88-year-old may not have the capacity to make the decision herself. But after Lee released a statement on Thursday to say she is 'happy as hell' about the release, Shields told DailyMail.com he has backed down. However, doubts remain as a number of Lee's hometown friends maintain the novelist, who has been left blind after suffering a stroke, was 'manipulated'. Explaining his u-turn, Shields told DailyMail.com: 'You know what, I've decided I'm happy as hell too now. 'I believe that statement was genuine and, really, this can only be a good thing for the industry.' Shields initially said Lee was vulnerable to manipulation after her sister and lawyer, Alice Lee, died. Unaware? Harper Lee, pictured with Gregory Peck, who starred in the movie version of To Kill A Mockingbird, allegedly did not know the manuscript for her original version - Go Set A Watchman - survived 60 years . Alice, who died in November 2014 at the age of 103, was 'Harper Lee's buffer against the publicity hungry world,' he told the International Business Times. However, he told DailyMail.com: 'I expressed concerns about the book, the process, and the fact that it is unedited. 'But this is good news for booksellers. I hope we will all be reading the same book this summer and I hope it is Go Set A Watchman. 'At the end of the day, people are really looking forward to another story about Scout, and so am I.' Addressing his fellow critics, Shields said: 'I think the tide is turning.' However, that sea change has yet to reach Monroeville, where Lee grew up. Janet Sawyer, owner of the Courthouse Café and childhood friend of the Lee sisters, told AL.com: 'I don't think she agreed to do it. I think it's her attorney being greedy, because Ms. Lee was a very private person who didn't like a lot of publicity. 'She had a stroke several years ago and her mind is not in a condition to make these decisions, I don't think, personally. 'Tonja Carter [Lee's attorney] doesn't allow her to see her friends anymore. She's isolated her from the world in order to manipulate her.' Best-seller: After the publication of To Kill A Mockingbird, Harper Lee did not publish again . Lee previously said she had not realized the manuscript of her new book had survived and that she was 'humbled and amazed' it was going to be published now. Adding to the outcry, Marja Mills, a friend of the Lee family and author of a Harper Lee memoir, told the New York Times: 'I have some concerns about statements that have been attributed to her.' She said  Alice Lee, told her that Harper 'can't see and can't hear and will sign anything put before her by anyone in whom she has confidence.' Furthermore, publisher Jonathan Burnham acknowledged that the publisher has had no direct conversations about the new book with Harper Lee, but communicated through her Monroeville attorney, Tonja Carter, and literary agent Andrew Nurnburg. However, slamming the allegations of coercion, a spokesman for the publishing house claims Lee said: 'I'm alive and kicking and happy as hell with the reactions to Watchman.' The novel, called Go Set A Watchman, was written before To Kill A Mockingbird but was rejected by publishers who set her to work on the novel that made her famous. To Kill A Mockingbird, set around a rape trial in the racially-divided Deep South of the US, has sold more than 40 million copies since it was published in 1960. Its central characters, Scout, her brother Jem and their lawyer father Atticus, were brought to life in a 1962 film starring Gregory Peck. The new book revolves around the now-adult Scout's return to her native Alabama from New York to visit her father. A spokesman for her publisher said: 'Harper Lee still enjoys reading and uses a magnifying machine from the New York Institute for the Blind to read books, newspapers and documents.' Go Set A Watchman will be published on July 14 by William Heinemann, which was the original UK publisher of To Kill A Mockingbird. The publisher says Carter came upon the manuscript at a 'secure location where it had been affixed to an original typescript of To Kill a Mockingbird. Burnham said during a telephone interview that he had known both Carter and Nurnburg for years and was 'completely confident' Lee was fully involved in the decision to release the book. 'We've had a great deal of communication with Andrew and Tonja,' said Burnham, adding that Nurnburg had met with her recently and found her 'feisty and in very fine spirits.","Publisher claims Harper Lee 'said she is happy as hell' about new book .

"A devoutly Christian Washington state couple who went on the run with their children amid an ongoing custody dispute with Child Protective Services have been found in California, with the mother arrested for allegedly headbutting and kicking officers. CPS went to the Bellingham address of Cleve Goheen-Rengo, 23, and Erica Carey, 29, on January 28 to take their three young children into protective custody following numerous welfare concerns over a chaotic home life, however the family had fled. The couple - who hit headlines last year after saying they lost custody of their newborn twins for delivering them via homebirth with no assistance - were not officially wanted, but a 'Be On The Lookout' had been issued  to  law enforcement across the West Coast, according to KSBW. Local news outlets also ran the notice, and a member of the public spotted the family at a gas station in Aptos, south of San Francisco, on Thursday and called police. Tracked down: Washington couple Cleave Rengo and Erica Carey were found in California on Thursday - along with their three young children - after going on the run. They had lost custody of their kids for a second time . 'Holistic Christian lifestyle': Erica Carey, 29, was arrested after being tracked down on Thursday after 'head-butting a sergeant', 'kicking a sheriff' and screaming for help from Jesus . Highway patrol and Santa Cruz County Sheriff's deputies seized upon the gas station and found the family. The children - three-month-old twins Moran Kai and Daniel and one-year-old son Levi - were not harmed. Erica Carey was arrested, however, for allegedly attacking police. 'She head-butted one of our sergeants and kicked a sheriff's deputy,' CHP Officer Brad Sadek told KSBW. Carey also reportedly screamed out for Jesus and told a local cameraman: 'Send a message to America for me. Children don't belong to the government. The government belongs to the people.' The father was not arrested. The three children have been placed in the care of Child Protective Services. The children had been removed in November following the birth of the twins, amid reports they were underweight and going without proper medical care. The couple claimed their refusal to travel to hospital with paramedics - who were called to the house after a neighbor called 911 over Carey's birthing cries - contributed to the CPS decision. The state said the children were removed for health and domestic reasons and not because of the home birth. One of the reasons was a refusal to treat their one-year-old son's eczema with proper medication, the state said. Carey and Rengo say they live a 'holistic lifestyle based on their Christian beliefs', according to The Billingham Herald. They admitted to only realizing they were having twins after the birth of the first baby, having not had one ultrasound. Dad and son: Rengo and his son, Levi, who was also taken into custody by social services in Washington State . The children were returned in December, however the were still under state protection, so would be checked upon regularly. Carey and Rengo were also ordered to undergo counseling. Commissioner Thomas Verge told Rengo, 23 and Carey, 29, that the couple's religious beliefs had caused a chaotic home life for their children. He said that if the state believes the children's lives are in danger again they will be removed. 'This is about second chances because you blew the first one,' said Verge to the couple according to The Herald. But Verge also pointed out he could see the 'love you both have for your children.' Unconventional: Erica May Carey, 29 and Cleave Rengo, 23, are common-law husband and wife . When the CPS heard of the verdict they said, 'We accept this ruling and will work with the family to provide them with services aimed at helping keep the children safe in their home.' The court removed one-year-old, Levi and twins Moran Kai and Daniel, on November 5. In his verdict to return the children, Verge said that the home-birth, 'has no bearing whatsoever on my decision here.' During the case which was heard in court in December, the state 'attempted to show an unstable household marked by numerous contacts with law enforcement … within the past two years and refusal to provide medical treatment to the children,' according to the Bellingham Herald. It was only after the couple, who are common-law married in Washington because they have never got a marriage license, decided to have their home birth that the CPS became involved. 'I’ve done a lot of research about other women who have done it and they said the spiritual experience was so much more wholesome. It was just us. We wanted to preserve that sanctity and sacredness in our birth,' said Carey as she justified her decision to give birth at home. The CPS began showing up at their home after the 911 call in November and said that after they took custody of the children after one-year-old Levi developed pneumonia and ear infections. Assistant Attorney General Rob Olson told the Washington court that law enforcement have been in contact with the famiy 21 times since 2013. The calls related to refusal to provide medical care for their children, with concerns they were underweight and domestic issues between the couple, such as Rengo's mental health and bipolar disorder. However, Christina Nelson-King, the attorney for the couple argued that 'Most of the safety risk was primarily speculative,' according to the Bellingham Herald. Alternative: Erica Carey, seen here with son Levi, 1, admitted she did not know she was carrying twins until she gave birth in November because she had never had an ultrasound . 'Parents have a Constitutional right to parent as they see fit,' Nelson-King added. However, he criticized them for their attitude towards the CPS which he said was doing its job properly. 'They did exactly what they should do,' he said, adding that they tried everything to help the family and were met by resistance. 'Their lives are dedicated to children. They are not the enemy. They are the heroes.' Washingon Governor, Jay Inslee waded into the controversial case  to recognize the support the Rengo family received last year. 'I want to thank you for your concern and willingness to be vocal,' said Governor Jay Inslee on his official Facebook page. The Governor also sought to clarify any rumors surrounding the removal of the children by social services. 'I’d like to be clear: every child’s safety is our top priority in situations like these. Rumors have circulated that the removal of the Rengo children was due to breastfeeding or their home births,' wrote Inslee. 'Those rumors are false. Breastfeeding and home birthing are not factors that would cause CPS to take children from a home. Their removal from the home was based on factors unrelated to a home birth or breastfeeding.'","Erica May Carey, 29 and Cleave Rengo, 23, have been in a custody dispute with Child Protective Services since the birth of their twins in November .

"This is the horrifying moment greyhounds charged into the traps at their top speed of around 40mph after race organisers failed to lift them from the track. Footage at Romford track in east London last week shows how the dogs were so focussed on chasing the hare several could not avoid the obstruction in front of them. Incredibly the dogs who managed to avoid the trap quickly turned round and ran back to check on their fellow greyhounds. No dogs were killed in the incident, although two  are being treated for injuries by vets who will assess if they can ever race again, a source said. Collision: Two greyhounds were injured after they ploughed into the traps during a race after they failed to be lifted from the track . Aftermath: Dogs in the race turned on their heels and sprinted back to check on the other greyhounds . An investigation has been launched by Coral, the  owners of the track. The bookmaker said the mechanism that lifts the stalls failed and the driver of the 'hare', which the dogs follow round the track, was not notified to stop it. Anti-dog racing campaign group Greyt Exploitations says that  Romford is the country's 'worst offender' for track injuries, but bosses say they are 'more diligent' and professional than other tracks. Greyt Exploitations' figures for the first five months of 2014 show that 221 dogs were involved in track injuries or incidents at Romford, and 86 of the dogs had not raced again by October. Race: The greyhounds sped round the bend during the first lap only to be met with the large metal structure blocking the track . Accident: Coral say it was a tragic accident and lessons would be learned to ensure it didn't happen again . Campaigner Trudy Baker said: 'I am absolutely appalled by the video. How was there no procedure in place for when the trap won't lift? And if there is a procedure, why didn't it work?. 'Romford has the highest numbers for track injuries. They say that is because they are more diligent, but the film shows the complete opposite.' Coral are investigating the cause of the failures. A spokesman said: 'We have carried out an internal investigation into the events that occurred last week at Romford which resulted in injuries being suffered to two greyhounds. 'At this stage we are not certain what caused the failure in the mechanism that removes the traps from the track but we suspect that the very cold temperatures on the night may have been responsible. We are continuing to investigate the cause of this in order to reduce the likelihood of it occurring again. 'We do however have processes in place, should this mechanism fail, to alert the hare driver to stop the hare, but unfortunately these were not followed last night leading to the greyhounds continuing. This was unacceptable and avoidable and we will review these processes and carry out further training to ensure that an incident like this never happens again'.","Footage shows how several greyhounds could not avoid metal stalls .

"Talk about being caught red-handed! This is the moment two car thieves are tracked by a dashcam as they hop into a vehicle and take it on a 90-second joyride through the snowy streets of Brooklyn, New York. The unidentified men - who committed the crime Tuesday afternoon - clip a woman crossing the road, bump into another vehicle and speed through red lights as they go. At one point, they drive in the lane of oncoming traffic in order to pass a slower vehicle. During their high-speed jaunt the two robbers are heard heavily cursing in conversation. Shaya Jungreis, 21, was revealed as the owner of the car. He told VIN News that he left his 2013 Infiniti Q50 unlocked with the engine running in the Bushwick neighborhood as he went to check a construction site he was working on. He said he was literally gone for 'a second' before the thieves hopped into his car. Once he saw what was happening it was too late to take action. Jungreis borrowed a phone from a worker to contact police, who unsuccessfully tried to track his iPhone which had been left in the car. One man was seen wearing a blue jacket with black pants and a black beany hat.

Footage shows him seemingly ducking down as he spots the dashcam in the window. His assailant appears dressed head to toe in black. The duo walk towards the automobile from either side before getting in and driving away. However, their journey only lasts for about 90 seconds before they decide to dump the motor and run. Police later found the Infiniti with damage to the front bumper, grill, license plate and front end sensors.. An NYPD spokesperson told ABC News that officers are now looking for the suspects. Jungeris, who bought the dashcam a year ago in case of an accident, says he's never leaving his car running unlocked again. While the two men left Jungreis’ car, they reportedly took all of his credit cards, cell phone and approximately $200 in cash.","Two car thieves were tracked by a dashcam as they hopped into a vehicle and took it on a joyride through the streets of Brooklyn, New York .

'This man has taken what he sees as an easy opportunity by stealing a purse from a dying woman. 'I am sure the community will be equally disgusted and I appeal to anyone who may have seen this man take the purse and walk off on Leigh Road.

"A McDonald's Sausage Burrito certainly promises to fire you up for the day, with more than 100 ingredients including one chemical compound used in fireworks. A new behind-the-scenes video reveals that although the liquid egg in the sandwich originates from a farm in Michigan, it is mixed with twenty other components before flash frozen and reheated at restaurants. Among the scrambled egg mix is carboxymethyl cellulose - a binding compound found in denture adhesives  - and sodium benzoate, which is also used in fireworks to produce a whistling sound. Scroll down for video . Tasty treat? A McDonald's Sausage Burrito certainly promises to fire you up for the day, with more than 100 ingredients including one chemical compound used in fireworks . Both ingredients are commonly used in the processed food industry as a cheap way of thickening and preserving goods. The other components of the McDonald's breakfast burrito include 'pre-cooked sausage crumbles.' Thankfully the brown-colored nodules do contain pork. But the niblets are blended with various other substances including propyl gallate - an antioxidant preservative also used in a wide variety of vanity products, including lipsticks and shower gel. After the egg and pork is combined, a layer of  processed American cheese is melted on top. Caught on camera: A new behind-the-scenes video reveals that although the egg in the sandwich originates from a farm in Michigan, it is mixed with twenty other components before flash frozen and reheated at restaurants . Main supplier: The eggs used in U.S. McDonald's come from Herbruck Poultry Ranch in Michigan . Soy lecithin - which some suggest triggers weight fluctuations and gastrointestinal problems - is added to the milk, cream, water and 'cheese culture' blend, in a bid to stop the cheesy slices from getting stuck together in storage. Finally, the egg, sausage and cheese is wrapped up in a tortilla wrap by chefs. In a bid to extend the shelf life of the flour product, a number of preservatives are added during the factory baking process. And hey presto, a McDonald's Sausage Burrito is served. The finished breakfast meal  contains 300 calories, 12 grams of protein and 790 milligrams of sodium - more than one third of the recommended daily intake. McDonald's is striving to be more transparent about what goes into its products with ingredients and nutritional values clearly listed on its website. It recently launched an online video series titled 'Our Food. Your Questions' in a bid to boost its performance in the U.S., where sales slid at established locations in the last quarter of 2014. In addition to increased competition, McDonald's is trying to keep up with changing tastes, with places such as Chipotle marketing their food as more wholesome alternatives. To improve the image of its food, McDonald's recently rolled out chicken wraps with sliced cucumbers and the option to substitute egg whites in breakfast sandwiches. It also plans to eventually let people swap out the French fries in value meals with options like salad or vegetables. FLOUR TORTILLA .

"This  King Penguin chick- the first to be born in the UK in five years- has gone from a tiny six inch weakling to a staggering two and a half feet tall giant in a matter of months. It was weak, wrinkly and grey, unable to even stand on its own two feet when it was born at Birdland Park and Gardens in Bourton on the Water, Gloucestershire, last September. Now the big ball of fluff has rocketed from a puny half a pound to a whopping 1.5 stones in four months on a diet of liquidised herrings. Scroll down for video . In the few short months since it was born (left), the chick has shot up to a staggering two and a half feet tall (right) complete with a thick layer of fluffy brown feathers . Britain's only King Penguin chick has undergone a remarkable transformation in just four months - ballooning from half a pound to a whopping stone and a half . The baby penguin was being hand-reared by the park's expert keepers it has gone from strength to strength, transforming into a full-sized penguin. And with another predicted big freeze just around the corner,  chick looks more than prepared thanks to its thick new thick, downy brown coat. Eventually the feathers will be replaced by a slick coat that will allow the penguin to take to the water and join the others in its colony. But until that happens it is content snuggling in with its huge winter coat on. The rather ugly baby penguin was weak, wrinkly and grey, unable to even stand on its own two feet when it was born . Now the King Penguin looks much better prepared for the cold winter weather-  although it must still avoid the water until its adult plumage comes through . Simon Blackwell, the park's manager, said: 'The transformation of our King penguin chick is incredible - just a few months ago it was tiny and wrinkly, and now it is a huge ball of fluff standing at two and half feet tall. 'Penguins have to put on a huge growth spurt in their first few months in order to have enough feather and fat to survive the freezing winters. 'They first develop a massive downy coat to keep them warm then as they get older the down is replaced by slick feathers. At first their new coat is grey but eventually they develop the colours we know them for. The tiny King Penguin chick, the only one born in the UK in five years, measured just over 15cm long or  around six inches when it was born . 'While the chick still has its downy coat it can't go in the water because otherwise it would be too heavy and it would drown. King Penguins are the second largest of the penguin species, growing to an average of just over three feet tall and weighing 33lbs. Like many penguins, fully grown but unfledged chicks can appear to be larger than the adult birds, thanks to their thick fluffy coats. As adults the flightless birds shed their fluff and develop the King Penguin's distinctive bright orange and black feathers around their necks and heads. They live in huge colonies on the ice slopes of the sub-Antarctic islands, and there is an estimated world population of 2 million breeding pairs. The largest breed of all the penguins is the Emperor which stands 4 feet high and weighing up to 99lbs. 'Once it develops its shiny coat it will be able to swim, which is the first big step to becoming an adult. 'The huge fluffy coat is the penguin equivalent of us wrapping up in a heavy tog duvet. 'While the rest of us have been shivering in the cold these past few weeks the King penguins have been loving it - it's more like home for them.' King penguins - Aptenodytes patagonicus in Latin - are the second largest species of penguin, growing as tall as three feet and weighing up to 2.5 stones. They are distinguishable by their orange tinted breasts, cheeks and beaks. In the wild they live off small fish and squid and are native to the islands of northern Antarctica. Edinburgh Zoo is famously home to Sir Nils Olav, a King penguin which in 1972 was appointed Colonel-in-Chief of the Norwegian Royal Guard.","The tiny, grey chick was just six inches tall when it was born last September .

"She claimed to have received a less than friendly welcome at her local mosque – and sparked outrage when she shared the experience on Twitter. But new evidence appears to contradict allegations by Channel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman that she was ‘ushered out the door’ by Muslims during a visit. CCTV footage was released yesterday showing that instead of being ejected from the place of worship, she left on her own. Scroll down for video . Cathy Newman was filmed on CCTV entering the South London Islamic Centre in Streatham (left) then leaving unaccompanied (right). The journalist has apologised after telling Twitter followers she was 'ushered' off the premises . Miss Newman took to Twitter to describe the incident, telling followers she had been 'ushered into the street by a man' It also emerged that Mrs Newman had arrived at the wrong location anyway as she attempted to take part in Visit My Mosque day. Rather than being hurried to the door, she had simply been pointed in the right direction by Muslims and left to make her own way out. Mrs Newman last night apologised for causing any ‘misunderstanding’ over the visit. However, it has come a little too late for the Islamic centre at the centre of the claims, which has received a torrent of online abuse and two telephone death threats which have been reported to police. The row started on Sunday after the TV journalist arrived at the South London Islamic Centre wearing a headscarf. But she quickly rushed on to Twitter, claiming she had been ‘ushered’ out of the door, implying unfriendly attitudes to Western women were behind her expulsion. The news reader was seen speaking to a man who in the mosque, and gestures towards the door at one point during the encounter. She had mistakenly arrived at the South London Islamic Centre for an event . Miss Newman said she was 'ushered' out of the South London Islamic Centre (pictured above) in Streatham . The journalist later visited the nearby Hyderi Islamic Centre (above). Esmat Jeraj, a trustee at the centre, said she was 'disappointed' by Miss Newman's claims and that they 'fuel Islamophobia' But it quickly emerged the mosque was one of many not taking part in the event and she was supposed to be at another location nearby where her camera crew had been waiting. The CCTV clips revealed by The Huffington Post website show Mrs Newman entering the mosque and start to take off her shoes while having a very brief conversation with a man in the lobby. As the primary purpose of Visit My Mosque day was to increase understanding of Islam, I was horrified to hear the Mosque I visited in error has had death threats. ""I’m sorry for any misunderstanding there has been. I would be happy to pay a private visit to South London Islamic Centre once again.” He gestures several times to the left before she puts her shoes back on and leaves alone, walking out through the courtyard. Apparently a little confused, she spoke to no-one else inside the premises and the entire encounter lasts no more than a few seconds. Shortly after, she was back on the street again, and straight on to Twitter. In a series of tweets she told her 78,000 followers: ‘Well I just visited Streatham mosque for Visit My Mosque day and was surprised to find myself ushered out of the door. ‘I was respectfully dressed, head covering and no shoes, but a man ushered me back on to the street. I said I was there for Visit My Mosque. But it made no difference.’ Mrs Newman, 40, who lives in south London, was in fact due at the Hyderi Islamic Centre, where she had been invited along with a camera crew. Miss Newman has apologised for the incident which she described as a 'misunderstanding' She made her way to meet her colleagues there and tweeted that she had received a ‘wonderful warm welcome’ by contrast. Followers took Mrs Newman at her word, and there was even an apology from the South London Islamic Centre, which feared someone might have been rude to the TV presenter. But yesterday mosque spokesman Aslam Ijaz said the video showed Mrs Newman had not been ushered out and appeared to be confused. He said she spoke to a man who did not understand her properly and is thought to have assumed she was seeking the neighbouring church, which he pointed towards. Mr Ijaz said: ‘I was really surprised that she would say she was ushered out of the mosque. Now there’s this impression we don’t like women. She said something that was not correct.’ Thanks to her ill-informed Tweets, he said, the mosque had received its first threats since opening in 1978. Mr Ijaz said he had made several efforts to contact Mrs Newman to discuss her claims, but had received no response. He pleaded for ‘the truth’ to be told to ensure his mosque was ‘not made a target’. Mrs Newman said last night: ‘As the primary purpose of Visit My Mosque day was to increase understanding of Islam, I was horrified to hear the mosque I visited in error has had death threats. ‘I’m sorry for any misunderstanding there has been. I would be happy to pay a private visit to South London Islamic Centre once again.’","The journalist has apologised for Twitter rant against Streatham mosque .

"Instead of scanning the beach for fins, Queenslanders can track sharks in near real time on their phones. Researchers this week tagged three tiger sharks off Fraser Island, in Queensland's southern coast, and their movements can be followed by anyone using a smartphone app. According to the app, Jedda, a 3.5-metre female tiger shark, is heading north along the coast through the Coral Sea. Southeast Queensland tiger shark researcher Bonnie Holmes says the app could one day be used to warn people when a shark is in the area. Scroll down for video . Researchers this week tagged three tiger sharks off Fraser Island, near Bundaberg, and their movements can be followed by anyone using a smartphone app . According to the app, Jedda, a 3.5-metre female tiger shark, is heading north along the coast through the Coral Sea . 'Having that information in real time is fantastic and if people do want it for a slight safety reason then absolutely,' Ms Holmes told AAP on Friday. The data will provide insight into the migratory patterns of the sharks, of which little is known, and help ensure the sustainability of the often feared creature. Ms Holmes is hopeful the research will lead to a reduction in the number of sharks killed in Australian waters under government culling programs. 'We might be able to show they don't go to certain areas so we might be able to remove some of that shark control gear,' she said. Southeast Queensland tiger shark researcher Bonnie Holmes says the app could one day be used to warn people when a shark is in the area . The research is a collaboration between a number of Australian scientists and shark tracking organisation Ocearch. Dr Adam Barnett, a marine and environmental science researcher at James Cook University, said having access to technology and equipment on board the Ocearch research ship is invaluable. 'Having hands-on, safe access to live mature tiger sharks will be a significant boost to research... providing data we could never have dreamed of achieving on our own,' he said. Researchers will make their way north tagging about 20 sharks between Fraser Island and Cairns, before heading to the Northern Territory and Western Australia. The study also aims to identify how well protection measures are working. In Queensland, the sharks are only protected within designated areas of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.","Three sharks were tagged off Fraser Island, Queensland's southern coast .

"Shocking Facebook photos of a father who had his jaw broken in a street beating were reported to the social networking giant - for 'inciting violence'. Wife Laurette Martin, 38, spoke of her outrage after receiving the report on images of her HGV driver husband Jim lying in his hospital bed, which she shared with the world to catch his attacker. Rangers fan Mr Martin, a father-of-four, was attacked in a suspected act of hooliganism on Sunday near his home in Newarthill, Lanarkshire, hours after watching his team play rivals Celtic in Glasgow. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Anger: Laurette Martin, 38 (right) posted photos of her battered and bloodied husband Jim (left) on Facebook to help catch his attackers - but was reported to the site for supposedly inciting violence by another user . Images: HGV driver Mr Martin (above) was left with serious injuries in hospital including a broken jaw . Photos of his injuries were quickly shared online and were included in news reports on the violence around the match, prompting an anonymous user to report them to Facebook. Mrs Martin, whose husband is now recovering out of hospital, was accused of breaking the social media site's rules on explicit content - though fortunately for her, the photos were not removed. 'I have been reported for promoting graphical violence by posting my husband's bloody face after his brutal attack,' she said. 'I posted this photo because I wanted to get information on who the culprits where and to show people who might have been involved or who might know the culprits what they have done to my wonderful loving husband, a father of four children. Offending photo: It was this distressing image of her husband's injuries which was reported . 'In no way have I done this to promote violence but to make people aware and to be carefully when out at night as there are so many evil people out there. 'If anyone has a problem with what I post and don't like it then by all means contact me before making a silly statements that are not true. 'I really don't have time to worry about silly things as I have more important things to worry about at this moment in time but it has annoyed me.' Facebook rules forbid anyone from posting content that 'incites violence' or includes graphic scenes. The rules state: 'You will not post content that: is hate speech, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.' However, the social networking site reviews cases and does not remove every image reported to it. The attack happened hours after Sunday's match between the two rivals, who are known as the Old Firm. Mr Martin's 17-year-old son Jordan was also a victim of the same attack but managed to escape. There was also outrage after a ten-year-old fan, Kieran Duffy, had a bottle thrown at his head on the way to watch the clash with his twin brother Declan. A local businessman has since offered a £1,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of Kieran's attacker. Violence: The attack happened hours after a Rangers v Celtic match at Glasgow's Hampden Park . Mr Martin was set upon as he walked past the McAlpine's Bar pub at 10.40pm on his way home from a local shop. Doctors needed to operate on Mr Martin's broken jaw amid fears he might have suffered permanent brain damage. Old Firm violence: Ten-year-old Kieran Duffy had a bottle thrown at his head on the way to the match . The HGV driver also suffered broken teeth and cuts and bruises to his face after being punched and kicked in the head as he lay on the ground. His 17-year-old son Jordan managed to escape after being punched and raised the alarm. Dressmaker Mrs Martin added: 'These scumbags have no idea what this has done to my family, our kids who are so upset by this and my baby who keeps asking for her daddy. 'I wanted to get information on who the culprits were and to show people who might have been involved or who might know the culprits what they have done to my wonderful loving husband.' Facebook has repeatedly been criticised for removing new mothers' 'breastfeeding pride' photos because they supposedly break nudity rules. Emma Bond, 24, of Oswestry, Shropshire, had a photo of her nursing premature baby Carene removed on the day she uploaded it in October. And in 2011 breast cancer survivor Melissa Tullett, from Rochester, Kent, was outraged when she had a celebratory photo of her reconstructed breasts removed from the site. Facebook reinstated Ms Bond's photo - but told Ms Tullett she would have to keep her photos offline. Three men aged 19, 23, and 29 had been arrested in connection with the alleged assault on Mr Martin, police said. Facebook rules forbid anyone from posting content that 'incites violence' or includes graphic scenes. The rules state: 'You will not post content that: is hate speech, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.'

"British academics have helped develop a robot, which is both a home help and a friend to older people who may be ill, trapped and alone. The Care-O-bot 3 is much more like a utilitarian household appliance than the action figures that featured in the futuristic film iRobot, starring Will Smith. And she - or he - is more likely to offer a Karaoke sing along and make a cup of coffee than go on a murderous rampage - or at least that is the idea. Scroll down for video . A UK team has designed a robot butler called Care-O-Bot 3 (shown). The machine has a flexible arm that can pick up drinks. It also has a tray - which doubles as a face - to rest objects on . The robot is the result of a collaboration between British and European academics under the umbrella of Accompany - Acceptable Robotics Companions for Ageing Years. The hope is that it will help older people to stay in their homes and live an independent life, rather than being moved miles away from friends and family into an expensive care home. The team, which is co-ordinated by Dr Farshid Amirabdollahian of the University of Hertfordshire, have combined a robot 'butler' and software from a range of experts to deliver Care-O-bot 3. Importantly, the machine does far more than fetching and carrying, for it has been programmed to be a friend, providing emotional support to someone living alone. It will suggest activities to motivate people who otherwise might spend their day, parked in a chair in front of a TV, never speaking to anyone - and it will call for help if they are in trouble. The LCD screen offers images of a face that is smiling and happy when a task has been successful and will look downcast or sad when there is a problem, such as the user forgetting to take their medication. It will also provide the social interaction, someone to talk to, that will help people stave off loneliness and depression. The robot is the result of a collaboration between British and European academics under the umbrella of Accompany - Acceptable Robotics Companions for Ageing Years . The arm can be folded behind its back like a butler (left), or extended to pick up objects (right) The machine will suggest activities to motivate people who otherwise might spend their day, parked in a chair in front of a TV - and it can even take out the rubbish . Dr Amirabdollahian, a senior lecturer in Adaptive Systems, led a three year study at the university's robot house, which involved acting out scenarios with human guinea pigs. The robots, which are made by a German company, are already available to buy as household butlers, however he believes they can be adapted to become carers to the elderly and disabled. They have a single arm that can lift and carry items, together with cameras and sensors as well as an LCD screen, which flips over to become a tray. He said: 'It can act as a fetch and carry device and part of an observing system. It will work as part of a smart environment in the home, which includes cameras on the ceiling and sensors. 'These will know when the fridge door is open or the coffee machine is on. There are also motion detectors which will identify where the person is in the house. 'The robot processes this information, so the idea is that it can be directed by the person to perform various tasks, such as fetching a book or reach a high shelf.' The LCD screen is detachable and can be used like a tablet to issue commands. It also allows the used to 'look through the eyes of the robot' via its cameras if it is sent to another room or to answer the door. The research in Hertfordshire has been specifically looking at the interaction between robots and humans and the associated ethical problems. This element has been led by Professor of Artificial Intelligence, Dr Kerstin Dautenhahn. The robots, which are made by a German company, are already available to buy as household butlers, however he believes they can be adapted to become carers to the elderly and disabled . The hope is that it will help older people to stay in their homes and live an independent life, rather than being moved miles away from friends and family into an expensive care home . Dr Amirabdollahian said: 'Our aim is to use the robot to increase independence and quality of life. 'The envisaged relationship between the user and the robot is that of co-learner, whereby the robot and user provide mutual assistance and so that the user is not dominated by technology, but feels empowered by it. 'We have been looking at whether this sort of technology is acceptable and the ethical tensions that exist.' One issue is how much information collected by the robot should be shared with third parties, perhaps other members of the family who want to ensure their loved one is safe. The team has investigated how the robot can interact with people more naturally and overcome a prejudice that machines are cold, emotionless and even sinister. 'We introduced the notion of empathy to remove the coldness. For that, we created a mask which appears on the LCD screen. Sometimes the mask is happy and sometimes it is sad and it will then explain why, for example, because someone has forgotten to take their medication,' he said. He said the team had also introduced an element of social manners and etiquette by, for example, ensuring the robots do not get too close or invade the user's personal space. Using an app, a person can tell the robot what to do. For example, it can open doors for people, or bring them a bottle. The team said machines like this could be in our homes in 10 years . 'We have looked at the mannerisms that can be taught to machines to make the social interaction more acceptable,' he said. The three year research project was funded by a £3.6 million ($5.5 million) grant from the European Commission. The team are now drawing up a new proposal to take the idea from the drawing board to a product that will be made available to care homes and individuals. 'We have shown that the concept works,' Dr Amirabdollahian added. 'We are now writing another proposal to turn this into a product We need to think about whether it first goes into an individual's home or a care home where one robot is looking after a lot of people. 'I would say that within ten years you will have some of these machines in people's homes.' The Care-o- Bot 3 itself can be bought for £180,000 ($275,000), however this figure is expected to come down sharply. Intriguingly, a Care-O-Bot 4 is now being produced which has two arms, a more human shape with a more recognisable head and face.","A UK team has designed a robot butler called Care-O-Bot 3 .

"Rafaele Sollecito appears to be morphing into Amanda Knox - the woman who helped him murder his ex-girlfriend - as the duo prepare for yet another appeal against their convictions. Sollecito was re-convicted along with his former lover, U.S citizen Knox, of killing his former partner Brit, Meredith Kercher, in November 2007. The pair's appeal against those convictions will now take place next month, a year after they were found guilty over the death for a second time. It seems unlikely Knox, who now lives in the U.S, will ever be returned to jail for the crime as she has repeatedly refused to return to Italy. If she is convicted again, Italy is likely to request to extradite her but her longstanding battle to prove her innocence has made her a cause célèbre in the U.S who may ignore political pressure to send her back. Sollectio on the other hand has no cards to play. He remains in Italy and authorities have his passport. Rafaele Sollecito appeared to be morphing into Amanda Knox, seen right at a re-trial in 2011, who helped him murder his ex-girlfriend, as the killers prepare for yet another appeal over their convictions . Sollecito appeared on Italian TV State Rai1 where he again maintained his innocence over the 2007 murder . A picture of Sollecito's ex-girlfriend, and the woman he was found guilty of murdering, Meredith Kercher, is shown on a big screen behind him during his interview . Ahead of the appeal, Sollecito appeared on Italian TV State Rai1, and with his long-flowing chestnut-colored hair he looked very similar to his co-offender. He again maintained his innocence, saying: 'If we look at the facts objectively, we'll see officers made several mistakes. Investigators never went further in looking at many things. 'I still cannot believe I might go to prison for something I did not do. I have suffered threats and pressures by investigators. They locked me in a room for 15 hours and questioned me for a long time, threatening that I would not be allowed out of prison.' Sellecito said 'I can still not shake off this sword of Damocles', and also said he believes '100 per cent' that Knox did not kill Kercher. Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years in jail by the Appeal Court in the northern city of Florence and Knox received 28 years. Sollecito and Knox were first found guilty of murder in November 2009. The killers' convictions were later quashed after experts said forensic evidence had been contaminated and they were released. Prosecutors then appealed that finding and the case was re-tried in March 2013. In January last year a court upheld the original verdict, but the pair remained at large as under Italy's legal system, any verdict reached after a second appeal but be ratified by the highest court. Sollecito told the show that he could not 'shake off this sword of Damocles' and said he could not believe that he could be sent to jail having 'not done anything'; he also said he believed Knox was '100 per cent' innocent . Knox, seen above in September 2011, now lives in West Seattle and works as a freelance reporter . Kercher, 21 (seen above in handout pictures from her family) was found dead on the floor of her bedroom in November 2007; some of her belongings were missing and Knox reported an apparent burglary to police . Since the last verdict, Sollecito, 30, has stayed in Italy. He was ordered to remain there after being found near the Italian border with Slovenia and Austria hours after being found guilty for the second time. He has since completed a degree in information technology. Knox, now 27, lives in West Seattle and works as a freelance reporter. She has completed a degree in creative writing. Kercher, 21, was found dead on the floor of her bedroom. Some of her belongings were missing and Knox reported an apparent burglary to police. Detectives concluded the supposed break-in looked staged and Knox became the prime suspect. She then implicated Patrick Lumumba, a bar owner she worked for. The duo were arrested along with Sollecito. Mr Lumumba was later released when evidence pointed to Rudy Guede's involvement. Guede was then accused of committing the murder along with Sollecito and Knox. In October 2008 he was found guilty of sexually assaulting and murdering Kercher.","Rafaele Sollecito was found guilty of murdering Meredith Kercher in 2009 .

"Doctor-assisted suicide is set to be legalized in Canada, putting the country in the company of a handful of U.S. and European territories. The Supreme Court in Ottawa said the practice would be allowed in the case of consenting adults who are suffering intolerably from a severe medical condition. The new legislation will take effect in 12 months. Friday's ground-breaking decision related to the case of two Canadian women with debilitating illnesses who fought for the right to end their lives. They died without ever seeing the ruling come into play. Lee Carter, left,  and her husband accompanied her 89-year-old mother Kay Carter, who suffered from spinal stenosis, to Switzerland in 2010 where assisted suicide is legal, to end her life - she was overjoyed at the Canadian Supreme Court's decision to lift the ban on doctor-assisted suicide on Friday . Gloria Taylor, an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patient and activist, who joined the right to die lawsuit in . 2011, passed away from her illness in 2012. The family of a second woman suffering from a degenerative spinal cord condition, Kay Carter, 89, who was forced to travel to . Switzerland to end her life, were also plaintiffs. 'Justice, dignity and compassion were the defining qualities of my mother,' Lee Carter said after Friday's decision came down. 'We just felt that it was a fundamental right for Canadians that they should have this choice.' She called it 'a huge victory for Canadians and a legacy for Kay.' Assisted . suicide is legal in Switzerland, along with a number of other . European countries and a few U.S. states including Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. Canada's Supreme Court last considered assisted suicide in . 1993 with the case of 42-year-old Sue Rodriguez, who also suffered from ALS. However, a lift on the ban was dismissed with a ruling at the time citing prohibitions on assisted suicide as 'the norm among Western democracies.' Since then, the act of counseling, aiding or abetting suicide in Canada has been deemed a criminal offense, carrying a maximum of 14 years in prison. Commenting on Friday's turnaround, Grace Pastine, litigation . director of B.C. Civil Liberties Association, which initiated . the challenge, said: 'This is one incredible day. The Supreme Court in Ottawa (pictured above) said the practice would be allowed in the case of consenting adults who are suffering intolerably from a severe medical condition . 'Physician-assisted dying is now recognized for what it is:a medical service that brings an end, for some individuals, tounbearable suffering.' Parliament can overturn the decision before the year is up but that is an unlikely . outcome. Since 1993 pressure for assisted suicide has persisted. Last . year the Quebec government introduced a bill to legalize it, . arguing this was a matter of healthcare under provincial . jurisdiction, not a criminal matter in the federal bailiwick. Religious groups have opposed it as well as organizations . representing people with disabilities. They argue that making it . easier to end people's lives is a slippery slope that makes them . feel vulnerable. However, the Supreme Court of Canada argued this week the ban on doctor-assisted suicide infringes  the 'life, liberty and security' of a person. 'We do not agree that the existential formulation of the . right to life requires an absolute prohibition on assistance in . dying, or that individuals cannot 'waive' their right to life,' the court said.","The Supreme Court in Ottawa said the practice would be allowed in the case of consenting adults who are suffering intolerably from illness .

"Within the space of a year, the face staring back in the mirror at Jackie Malton was almost unrecognisable. Though still smiling, the 42-year-old bore little resemblance to the vibrant mother pictured in March last year, brimming with hope at the prospect of marrying her partner. Just a month later doctors dealt Mrs Malton and her then partner Jim a devastating blow – she had a lesion on her brain. Within a year, a brain tumour had invaded her body, and despite surgery and months of treatment, just last month specialists revealed it was terminal. Days after being told she had weeks to live, Mrs Malton decided to marry her partner of six years in what she describes as a 'dream wedding'. Jackie Malton, 42, (left) was delighted when her partner Jim (pictured) proposed last March (left). Now, her appearance has been transformed (right) by surgery, months of chemotherapy and steroid treatment for a terminal brain tumour, but she insists her wedding was a 'dream' Mr and Mrs Malton married just days after being given the devastating news she had only weeks to live. They are pictured on their wedding day . Mr and Mrs Malton (centre) are pictured at their wedding, which was held at Doncaster Rovers Keepmoat Stadium, with their entire extended family . Mrs Malton's husband, Jim, 38, said: 'It was always her dream as a little girl to have a perfect wedding, I think it is for a lot of girls. 'She's an incredibly strong woman, she's just a really kind person and great fun. 'She worked as a barmaid in her last job at her local working men's club in Bentley and was loved by everyone. 'Jackie couldn't believe the wedding, the day itself was really busy, she was over-the-moon even though it absolutely exhausted her.' Mr Malton said they first discovered his wife's cancer when she began to suffer headaches which lasted for an entire week. He said: 'It just started getting increasingly worse, after a week of solid headaches I said ""You have to go to the doctor."" 'The doctor said ""I'm not happy with some of these results"", and he sent her up to Doncaster Hospital. Doctors found a lesion on her brain, and tests revealed it to be a glioblastoma multiforme – a type of aggressive tumour that can sometimes spread - and said she needed surgery immediately. Although they removed some of the tumour a week later, it was then the couple were given the devastating news Mrs Malton's cancer was terminal. A glioblastoma is an aggressive and fast-growing form of brain tumour. Fast growing tumours are much more likely to come back after treatment than slow growing tumours. The outlook is not good for people with more aggressive grade 3 and 4 tumours. Only about 20 in 100 children (20 per cent) diagnosed with glioblastoma will live for five years. Many adults live for less than a year. Source: Cancer Research UK . She endured months of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and treatment with steroids to fight the disease. These caused body to swell and her appearance to change dramatically. Then, on 22 January this year, the couple were told that despite the gruelling treatment, she had only weeks to live. Mr Malton describes the utter shock of hearing this news. He said: 'They said there's nothing more we can do, we asked them ""how long""? 'We thought maybe months, but they said a few weeks.' The pair thought of marriage straight away, having got engaged before Mrs Malton was diagnosed in April last year. However, they didn't know if they could afford a lavish wedding. Mr Malton said: 'It became apparent I would have to care for her and money started to run out really quickly. 'It was one of Jackie's family that came across the Eve Merton Dreams Trust, they have been fantastic and organised an amazing day.' The Eve Merton Dreams Trust is a Doncaster-based charity that raises money to help create an unforgettable memory for a terminally or seriously ill cancer patient in the borough. They helped with every aspect of the Maltons' wedding, from Mr Malton's suit, to Mrs Malton's wedding dress. Mr Malton said: 'Jackie looked absolutely stunning. When I was standing there, and the bridesmaids were walking up the aisle and parted so I could see Jackie, I had a lump in my throat. Mrs Malton was in a wheelchair for her wedding day, due to her deteriorating condition. The pair spent their wedding night eating McDonalds in the hospice, which Mr Malton said was 'perfect' as they were together . Mr Malton said: 'Jackie looked absolutely stunning. When I was standing there, and Jackie was coming up the aisle, I had a lump in my throat. It took everything not to start crying there and then, but I wanted to hold it together because I knew what an emotional day it would be' 'It took everything not to start crying there and then, but I wanted to hold it together because I knew what an emotional day it would be.' Mrs Malton was in a wheelchair and was unable to walk up the aisle because of her deteriorating condition. Her daughters Sheriden, 22, Chantelle, 16, and eight-year-old Caitlin, as well as Jim's 16-year-old daughter, Kayleigh, were by her side as bridesmaids. Mr Malton's son, Kai, 12, was an usher in the wedding, which was held at Doncaster Rovers Keepmoat Stadium. The newly-weds retired to St John's Hospice, where Mrs Malton is currently receiving treatment, after the ceremony, while their friends and family celebrated with a reception. And while eating a McDonald's in a hospital bed might not be the most traditional way to spend a wedding night, Mr Malton said it was all he had ever wanted. He said: 'The girls at St John's Hospice put rose petals on two beds and pushed them together for us. 'We ate a McDonald's and cuddled, which was just perfect. To us, that was better than if we had been at The Ritz or anywhere, because we were together.' Mrs Malton will be able to go home once her condition is stable and her pain medication has been prescribed. The whole family is looking forward to this moment, Mr Malton said, so they can make the most of every day of their lives together.

"Health officials have told supermarkets not to put displays of daffodils near fruit or vegetables- in case they poison shoppers. Shops were asked to relocate the spring flowers as they contain a toxic chemical which can cause stomach upset, nausea, and in severe cases can even require hospital treatment. In a letter to all major retailers, Public Health England  warned that large numbers of foreign customers, whose first language was not English, were at risk of confusing the plants for vegetables. Supermarkets have been told not to put displays of spring daffodils at the front of stores - in case they poison shoppers . It mentioned a case where a family who became ill and needed hospital treatment after they bought and ate the plant believing it was something else. The most common error is mistaking daffodil bulbs for onions but the flowers risk being mistaken for vegetables popular in China or even spring onions, could mistake them for other vegetables, according to The Grocer magazine. Despite their innocent appearance, all parts of the daffodil are potentially poisonous if eaten. The most common cause of poisoning come from mistaking daffodil bulbs for onions. The stems and leaves are also sometimes wrongly taken for a type of vegetable popular in Chinese cooking and often used to make dumplings. If eaten, they can cause severe vomiting and diarrhoea. Although the effects are very unpleasant, most poisoning victims recover fully without treatment. however, just a small amount of the bulb is enough to kill a dog, while munching on the leaves and flowers will make them very ill. The Blue Cross advises dog owners to not keep daffodils in their gardens. Daffodil-related poisonings are surprisingly common in Britain, becoming one of the most frequent causes of accidental poisonings. Public Health England said that its National Poisons Information Service was contacted 27 times last year for advice by medics who were treating poisoning cases linked to daffodils and narcissi last year. It said that over the past six years 63 patients suffered symptoms from poisoning. Professor Paul Cosford, medical director at Public Health England, warned in the letter: 'Daffodils are dangerous if eaten and poisoning can occur as a result. 'We are aware of an incident in Bristol a few years ago in which some shoppers, for whom English was not their first language, bought daffodils and cooked the plants believing them to be something else.

"There's not much ex-Marine, natural historian and presenter Monty Halls won't do in the name of adventure. 'At one point I was sleeping in a coffin-shaped, scorpion-filled cavity 500 feet up a limestone cliff face,' he tells Mail Online Travel. His new series, Lost Worlds, charts his escapades  with explorer, survival expert and pioneering climber Leo Houlding to some of the world's furthest flung corners. Scroll down for video... Monty Halls, left, and Leo Houlding, right,  travelled to the rainforests of Guyana and the Mulu caves in Borneo for their new show Lost Worlds . The pair travelled deep into to the rainforests of Guyana and the Mulu caves in Borneo. Their aim? To seek out places mankind has never set food, to find out if the age of exploration is really over. In two sneak preview videos, we see the pair gearing up to sleep 500 feet above the ground in hammocks hoisted up into the canopy of the Amazon rainforest. 'I was so far out of my comfort zone,' says Halls, a marine biologist. 'I love sea level and below, so it was nerve-racking for me.' 'But I was in safe hands. Leo is one of the best climbers in the world.' The adventurers spent the night sleeping on a tiny platform 500ft above the Amazon rainforest, which Halls admits took him right out of his comfort zone - and forced him to retreat into a cave . The two explorers were flown straight in to the remote jungle in Guyana, and even tried to scale a vertical rockface by a waterfall . The duo also over-nighted on a ledge the size of a kitchen table half way up the Melinau gorge, in Borneo, which was particularly challenging for Halls, who suffers from vertigo. 'Leo is fine with heights, so he slept on his hammock over the cliff edge, while I crawled into a tiny coffin-shaped cave. 'Once I got in, I noticed lots of little burrows all around me, so I decided to have a look with my endoscope. There were scorpions all around me.' 'I didn't sleep well that night, and I woke up to something crawling over my face.' Monty Halls, right, was joined by Leo Houlding, left, one of the world's best climbers, having scaled the notorious El Capitan in California, at 18 . He describes the adventure as an exercise in fear management - arachnophobia, claustrophobia, vertigo. You name it, they did it. Hall continues: 'We had once incident where one of the porters cut his foot with a machete. We were out in the middle of nowhere, and our medic had to strap him up. 'He could have lost a lot of blood, so he had to be carried out of the rainforest and helicoptered to safety. 'You are always tip-toeing on the edge of calamity with these things.' The pair took a two-day trek to the Mulu caves in Borneo. Halls says if they had lost their guides in the endless underground maze of caves, they'd have never got out. The daring pair encountered a huge variety of wildlife from the seemingly harmless to the utterly terrifying . 'The floor was a jumble of boulders and crags and ravines. We were squeezing through tiny little gaps. We fell over a lot, if we had broken a leg or something it would have taken weeks to get you out. We were squeezing through tiny little gaps. More people have stood on the moon than have been here.' No wonder the star refers to it as 'the most adventurous serious I've ever made'. The idea behind the series was to see if genuine exploration still exists. Are there still areas of the world so remote that just a handful of people can reach them? Throughout 2014 Houlding and Halls put t to the test, making extraordinary expeditions in South America and Borneo where they discovered new species, found legendary geographic features, and became the first people to measure two supposedly mythical waterfalls. The two also descended into the Mulu caves in Borneo, one of the longest networks of caves in the world . Even descending into complete darkness, in areas where so few humans have stepped, the duo came across wildlife . Monty Halls (left) served in the Royal Marines, while Leo Houlding (right) is one of the best climbers in the world . The duo teamed up to combine Houlding' remarkable climbing ability with Halls’ past as a Royal Marine Commando and his present role as a biologist. They managed to ascend a new route up the 1,000ft Melanau Gorge, as well as pushing deep into the Mulu Cave System, pushing themselves to the limit. So, having reached parts of the world barely touched before and even discovered new species, is there still more to see? Halls explains: 'The world has many places left to explore. We've explored 5 per cent of the deep sea. Man knows nothing about it.And only 30 per cent of our cave systems  have been explored.'

But a Mexican artist has turned pictures of classic Disney characters into the stuff of nightmares by adding movie villains. Drawings include a terrified Peter Pan confronting Michael Myers, from the Halloween films. Snow White being attacked by Jason, from the Friday the 13th film series and Rapunzel from Tangled being manhandled by Batman baddie The Joker. José Rodolfo Loaiza Ontiveros has turned pictures of classic Disney characters into the stuff of nightmares by adding movie villains; the image above shows the Joker manhandling Rapunzel from Tangled . Freddie Kruger from Nightmare on Elm Street provides a chilling contrast to Sleeping Beauty . Jason from Friday the 13th appears ready to attack Snow White, having already beheaded some rabbits . One particularly chilling scene depicts Sleeping Beauty being watched over by Freddie Kruger, from Nightmare on Elm Street. Another shows the limp body of the Little Mermaid being carried by Gill-man from the Creature from the Black Lagoon. The artist, José Rodolfo Loaiza Ontiveros, said: 'I find it interesting to present the viewer with opposite characters and suggest a different ending to 'happily ever after. 'My work is an ongoing tribute to pop culture and enables me to present a speech about our social vulnerability, prejudice and the double standards of our environment. 'But overall my work is a kind of thermometer to measure our level of tolerance about certain taboo subjects.' Artist José Rodolfo Loaiza Ontiveros, said: 'I find it interesting to present the viewer with opposite characters and suggest a different ending to 'happily ever after' Alex from A Clockwork Orange appears to be offering Snow White a drink she's reluctant to accept . Michael Myers from the Halloween series prevents Peter Pan from flying out of the bedroom window having already taken out Tinker Bell . Catwoman looks to be getting more than her share of milk and she feeds alongside the Aristocats . Snow White looks far less of a fairy tale character with knife in hand and Hannibal Lecter on her dress . Not surprisingly, not everyone is a fan of the 31-year-old's work. He said: 'People can react aggressively towards my work and immediately disqualify me. 'However, some people find them funny and witty, then congratulate me and write optimistic comments. 'Both reactions are important for me and I'm thankful because all of this helps me grow as an artist.' Mr Rodolfo uses oil and acrylic paint to create each picture which can take anything from a couple of days to a couple of weeks to complete.","Mexican artist wanted to suggest a different ending to 'happily ever after'

"A jihadist group that has pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda has taken over swathes of Syria as western forces have focused their efforts on defeating Islamic State. The al-Nusra Front have carved out their own territory in the region, raising fears a second jihadist mini-state could thwart any attempts to end the barbarity. The hardline Islamist fighting group has been gaining control across Idlib province in northern Syria since November, driving out other rebel groups, including western-armed moderates. Scroll down for video . Gaining control: The al-Nusra Front have carved out their own territory in the region, marked above in pink, raising fears a second jihadist mini-state could thwart any attempts by western forces to end the barbarity . Syrian rebel activists and commanders have said that in the past week – as airstrikes have focused around IS strongholds in the region – the Nusra Front have begun to extend its control into the northern city of Aleppo. Aleppo is seen as one of the last areas in northern Syria with a significant presence of moderate rebel groups. Mazen Alhor, an opposition activist in the city, said: ‘Nusra are trying to do in Aleppo what they did in Idlib — they want to wipe out the (western-backed) Free Syrian Army. ‘They are starting to behave like ISIS — kidnapping, enforcing Islamic rules. They have a strategy, they want an Islamic state.’ Sami Mashaal, the head of the Shura Council for the Revolution in Aleppo, said that on Wednesday the Nusra Front began establishing checkpoints inside the city. He said: ‘They are harassing people, trying to enforce Islamic rules — and civilians are getting angry about it.’ Violence: In the past week  the Nusra Front have begun to extend its control into the northern city of Aleppo, pictured above after a clash between members of the Free Syrian Army and forces loyal to Assad last week . Conflict: The Nusra Front has turned against the Islamic State after it was previously allied to the extremist group that eventually morphed into ISIS. Above, ISIS militants pictured in Aleppo in 2013 . The Nusra Front was established inside Syria in 2012 under Abu Muhammad al-Julani, a Syrian al-Qaeda commander, and was originally allied to the extremist group that eventually morphed into Islamic State. The two groups turned against each other at the start of last year however, in a war that has cost thousands of lives. The emergence of a new mini-state alongside the IS ‘caliphate’ could jeopardise western plans to train thousands of moderate rebel groups to fight Islamic State. A few weeks ago Britain announced plans to help train the moderate groups alongside other coalition partners in countries bordering the region. The Nusra Front and the Islamic State . The Nusra Front was established inside Syria in 2012 under Abu Muhammad al-Julani, a Syrian al-Qaeda commander, and was originally allied to the extremist group that eventually morphed into Islamic State. It rose quickly to prominence among rebel organizations in Syria for its reliable supply of arms, funding, and fighters. While it has avoided some of the more extreme techniques, such as beheadings, that made Al Qaeda unpopular, it was the first Syrian force to claim responsibility for  attacks that killed civilians. The two share the same ideology and rigid Islamic beliefs, but fell out during a power struggle that pitted Islamic State head Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi against Al Qaeda chief Ayman Zawahri and Al Nusra Front leader Abu Mohammad al-Golani. There were reports at the end of last year that the two groups would form an alliance. Despite the occasional coordination on a tactical level, al-Nusra and ISIS continue to fight each other while also fighting the Assad regime. As well as facing conflicts with a number of other groups, ISIS also faces problems within its own members, it has been reported. Some are extreme hardliners originally attracted by the harsh application of Sharia law; others are Syrian militants who  are reluctant to be used to reinforce ISIS units in neighboring Iraq. Hazzm Movement . Hazzm is one of the last remnants of non-jihadist opposition to Assad in northern Syria. It has been under attack from the Nusra Front in both the Aleppo and Idlib provinces. Last week the group clashed with the Nusra Front when the Al-Qaeda-affiliated group seized positions from Hazzm west of Aleppo. Hazzm has received what it describes as small amounts of military aid from foreign states opposed to Assad, including U.S.-made anti-tank missiles. It recently announced it was joining a coalition of mostly conservative Islamic rebel groups called Jabhat al-Shamiya, or the Levant Front. This was seen as an attempt to shield itself from future attacks by the Nusra Front. Free Syrian Army . The Free Syrian Army (FSA) was formed in August 2011 during the Syrian civil war by army defectors based in Turkey, led by Col Riad al-Asaad. The array of mainly Western-backed armed opposition groups that have little or no central coordination in fighting President Bashar al-Assad and rival militant groups. It is not clear how many fighters remain in FSA, which has also been hampered by restrictions in neighboring Turkey. The movement claims a force of 60,000 while opposition sources said recently as few as 4,000 were still fighting.","Al-Nusra Front are gaining control across Idlib province in northern Syria .

"A pensioner was bludgeoned to death with a slow cooker after a heated argument about presidential politics with her friend, a court has heard. On Thursday a suburban Detroit judge ordered that Tewana Sullivan be tried for first-degree murder following the death of Cheryl Livy, 66, at her home in a Livonia senior housing complex in October. Police Officer Michael Lewallen says when called to the apartment he found Sullivan, 50, sobbing near her mortally injured friend and saying she was 'sorry' she 'did it', and blood all over the walls. Sobbing: Attorney John McWilliams comforts defendant Tewana Sullivan, who has been charged with first degree murder following the death of Cheryl Livy. A court heard how the pair had been arguing about politics . Sullivan broke down in court as the judge hear how Livy had died because of injuries to her head, face and mid back, caused by a 'blunt instrument'. The Detroit News also reported that Livy also suffered injuries on the back of hands, which appeared to have been caused as she tried to protect herself. The cord of the slow cooker was wrapped around the victim's next when police arrived. Defense lawyer John McWilliams said the women were arguing over 'presidential politics' and 'whatever the controversy is between Democrats and Republicans.' Accused: Sullivan, right, reacts while looking at photographs in the aftermath of the incident with her attorney, John McWilliams (left). She stands accused of bludgeoning her friend to death with a slow cooker . He did not reveal which woman took which side. Livy was 'barely breathing' when she was discovered, the court heard, but died two days later in hospital from her injuries. When police arrested Sullivan she appeared disorientated and 'under the influence', they testified, with blood on her hands and clothing nearby. She was initially charged with assault with intent to murder, but following Livy's death the charges were upgraded to first-degree murder which carries a mandatory penalty of life without parole. Sullivan is currently being held in the Wayne County Jail and will next appear in court on February 12.","Detroit woman Tewana Sullivan is accused of murdering Cheryl Livy, 66 .

"A mother was hit with a staggering £1,200 in phone bills after texting hundreds of smiley face emoticon symbols that weren't included in her 'unlimited' £31-a-month contract. Paula Cochrane, 48, had no idea she was being charged 40p per emoticon by her contact provider EE and said she was 'raging' after the company only offered to cut her bill by £100. She is one thousands of people with certain Samsung handsets who have been stung by the charges - which are a result of text messages being converted into pricier picture messages when the popular face symbols are included. Not happy: Paula Cochrane has been hit with a staggering £1,200 phone bill after texting hundreds of smiley face emoticon symbols that weren't included in her 'unlimited' £31-a-month contract . Speaking to the Daily Record, she said: 'I am raging. I have never heard of this before and I've had a mobile phone for years. 'Even the staff at my local EE shop were shocked when I told them. They knew nothing about it. Do EE really think I'd run up these bills if I knew the cost? It's daylight robbery' 'I feel violated that EE have withdrawn more than £1,000 from my account for a £30.99-a-month contract. It's totally unacceptable.' The hairdresser, of Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, said that when her bill for November arrived and was more than £100, she assumed she had used the phone for longer than the allocated minutes in her contract. Huge charges: Smiley dace icons are converting text messages into pricier picture messages costing many smartphone users a fortune as they are unaware of the charges . She later called EE to get to the bottom of the charge and was horrified to discover that her combined bills for December and January were almost £900 - and her pending charge for February has already exceeded £150. She was told by an adviser that the Japanese smiley face symbols were being sent as picture messages. An EE spokesman told MailOnline: 'There are a number of factors which can affect whether customers are charged for sending an emoji usually by the settings on the handset and so is a manufacturer – rather than a network issue. ‘EE has a help section on the website which details instances where an SMS may convert into MMS.' If you are using a pre-2014 Samsung handset, including the Galaxy S1, S2, S3 and S4, as well as the Galaxy Note 1, 2, 3 and Galaxy Ace, you could be hit with huge charges for sending emoticons in messages, no matter what network you are using. This is because a number of their older handsets convert texts into picture messages when you include the smiley face icons. Picture messages, or MMS (multi-media service) messages cost far more than standard texts - meaning users can be hit by huge bills if they send dozens of the symbols every day. Apple, HTC, Nokia and Sony have all said that including an emoji or emoticon symbol in a text with their models will not convert it into an MMS. If you own one of the Samsung handsets affected, you can stop this from happening by taking the following steps (instructions may vary depending on what handset you use): . 1. Open SMS . 2. Select settings . 3. Scroll to  Input mode . 4. Select UniCode instead of automatic OR Select GSM alphabet (depending on handset) You could also use an app rather than your network to send messages. If you're out and about you'll be using your data but if you're using wi-fi, there's nothing extra to pay. Step 1 and 2: Enter your message setting on your Samsung phone. Depending on what handset you have, the presentation of these options may vary . Step 1: Enter your message icon . Step 2: Select message settings . Step 3: Scroll to Input mode . Step 4: Select GSM alphabet . They added: 'Mrs Cochrane did not query her bills with us until the end of January.’ Ms Cochrane had used smiley faces that were on her phone's toolbar and not from a downloaded app. She is not alone - as Consumer website MoneySavingExpert has received a huge number of complaints about the issue. In some cases, especially on older handsets, the emoticons are converted into MMS (multi-media service) messages, which can cost up to 40p each depending on what network you're on. And other smartphone users who create their own icons from full-stops, colons and brackets have found they are being converted into emoticons - running up the same charges. Older handsets known to be affected include the Samsung Galaxy S1, S2, S3 and S4, as well as the Galaxy Note 1, 2, 3 and Galaxy Ace. A Samsung spokesman told MailOnline: 'We can confirm that as of April 2014, every Samsung mobile device has a default setting that classifies emoticon images as an SMS and not an MMS. Popular craze: Emoticons, also known as emojis, are used to portray a texter's mood of feelings and are commonly used by people with smartphones . 'For older devices, if a message is going to be converted from an SMS into an MMS, a warning message is displayed to inform the user of this. 'We advise our customers to check their mobile phone tariffs if they are unsure of any charges related to SMS and MMS as well as the advisory notices displayed on their handset.' Apple, HTC, Nokia and Sony have all said that including an emoji in a text will not convert it into an MMS. The word emoticon comes from emotion and icon . Also known as emojis, they are used to portray a texter's mood of feelings - and in the earliest form were produced by sending combinations of colons and brackets to create facial expressions. Many smartphones now come with a vast collection of emoticon symbols, while apps containing thousands more can also be downloaded. The current form of emoticons first rose to popularity in Japan. In the autumn, Ofcom conducted a survey looking at all the reasons why people received higher-than-expected bills. Emoticons being billed as picture messages had affected four per cent of those who responded to the survey. One woman, who was hit with a £209 charge, told MoneySaverExpert: 'I phoned up EE to be informed that as my son has been including emojis in his messages, they are charged as picture messages, and not included in his contract. One O2 customer said she had also been hit with a large bill and was told emoticons were classed as picture messages on Samsung phones. She said: 'EE has now agreed to halve the bill, which I suppose I will have to accept, but I would just like to warn any other computer/smartphone illiterate parents of the pitfalls!' Speaking on the issue an Ofcom spokesperson told the Daily Express: 'We are aware that in some circumstances SMS may be transferred into MMS (for example, where one text is sent to multiple recipients or where an emoticon or emoji is used). Affected: People have reported the problem while using a number of Samsung's handsets . 'Based on our previous engagement with mobile providers about long texts/texts sent to multiple recipients and the subsequent conversion to MMS, our understanding is that the conversion is a handset issue. How that message is subsequently charged would be a mobile provider issue. 'However there are rules on transparency – we would expect mobile providers to make clear to consumers how much MMS cost and when such charges would apply.' If you are on a monthly contract, the amount you pay for MMS messages will vary depending on what network you use. Here's what each major company charges: . EE: 40P . O2: 40P . Orange: 40p . Three: 19.8p . T-Mobile: 20P . Virgin Mobile: 40p . Vodafone: 40p . An O2 spokesman said: 'If a customer is using a smartphone to send text messages to more than one person at the same time, they could be charged the cost of sending an MMS. 'It can also happen when the message contains icons, emoticons and symbols or an email address. And some apps (such as Facebook) that integrate with a customer’s contact list in their smartphone may result in an MMS charge too. 'To stop this happening, customers should make sure they don’t include symbols, icons or emoticons and also disable the integration between their contact list and apps like Facebook. 'It’s worth noting that many of these smartphones/devices will alert customers when a SMS message is converting to an MMS message before it is sent.'","Paula Cochrane, 48, had no idea she was being charged 40p per emoticon .

"Gentrification is out as a new phenomenon sweeps the cities of north America. Instead of neighborhoods gradually increasing in social status, some are now being 'youthified', according to new research. The trend of youthification describes the growing influx of young adults, those aged between 25-34, into higher density cities. The cities with the lowest proportion of residents aged 25-34 are clustered in the northeastern rustbelt. Apart from Washington DC those with the highest are all further west, as this map of north America shows . Millennials, those born between the early 1980s and early 2000s, are 'youthifying' cities across north America . The phrase has been coined by Markus Moos, a geographer and urban planner at the University of Waterloo in Canada. As reported by citylab.com, Moss describes youthification as different from gentrification - 'a series of stages involving ever slightly wealthier but more risk averse in-movers' - because 'the former is not explicitly a class-based process, although the two are not mutually exclusive.' Moos explains youthification as a process that occurs in discrete stages. It begins as younger people move into relatively inexpensive neighborhoods, such as those with spaces leftover from de-industrialized manufacturing districts. As youthification continues, newer rental housing and smaller one-bedroom apartments are built and amenities flood the neighborhood, drawing greater numbers of young people even as living costs rise. Some of these areas remain 'forever young', with new cohorts of young people continuing to move in as families and children head towards the suburbs in search of more space. Moos' online project Generationed City charts the most youthified cities in the US and Canada, according to the proportion of 25-34 year-old residents living there. Salt Lake City tops the list with 16.93 per cent of its population falling into that age category, ahead of Austin, Denver, Washington DC and Seattle. Houston and Las Vegas also rank highly. Calgary and Edmonton, two rapidly growing cities in western Canada, rank third and fourth while Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto lag behind in 24th, 31st and 33rd place out of the 57 largest metropolitan areas in the US and Canada. Unsurprisingly the rustbelt cities of Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Rochester, Cleveland and Detroit come at the bottom of the list. To answer the question of what causes youthification, Moos conducted a detailed statistical analysis of factors that might be associated with the movements of young people - such as household income, household size, the share of potential gentrifiers and the share of immigrants - across Canada's three largest cities between 1981 and 2011. While Moos finds several factors - including household income, household size and immigration - to be associated with higher density, he found the connection between density and age of residents has increased substantially over time. This is true in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. In the former the correlation  between young people (aged 25 to 34) and density - where -1 indicates a total negative correlation, 0 no correlation at all and +1 a total positive correlation - grew from .22 in 1981 to .66 by 2011. In Toronto, it went from .36 to .62 and in Vancouver it increased from .49 to .68. The associations between density and older age groups (44-54 and 55-64 years old) have generally moved in the other direction, indicating these individuals are moving toward the lower-density suburbs. In Toronto and Montreal, there is a negative correlation between people aged 65 and older and density. Salt Lake City in Utah has the highest proportion of young adults than any other north American city . This points to growing geographic segregation of age groups in the city. In the case of Vancouver Moos suggests this divide has become a 'generational bifurcation,' where older and young people live in the inner cities and those in middle age live in the less dense suburbs. He suggests these changes grow out of a number of socio-economic shifts. Young people in the US and Canada are experiencing less job security, more chinks in the social safety net, high housing prices, delayed childbearing and a growing enthusiasm for urban living. For these reasons, renting closer to the city centre, where increasing stocks of terraced housing and apartments are readily available, becomes a more attractive option. It remains to be seen whether this pattern will last and whether those who move to city centres in their 20s and 30s remain there to raise their children or move out like their predecessors. As Moos notes, the generational divide he observes is not nearly as stark as that of ethnic or class segregation. But, he adds, 'there are clear signs of a process of youthification underway that is indeed creating generationed spaces in our cities that if intensified in the future could lead to further inter-generational conflict.'","New study of 'youthification' shows young adults aged between 25-34 are flooding into higher density cities across Canada and the U.S.

"Federal investigators are looking into a former county prosecutor's allegation in a lawsuit that he was fired because he complained about Gov. Chris Christie officials dropping indictments against political allies of the governor. Bennett Barlyn, a former Hunterdon County assistant prosecutor, claims in the lawsuit that he was terminated for suggesting that politics influenced the dismissal of an indictment against former county undersheriff Michael Russo, and one other county official in 2011. Barlyn said he had a more than hour-long conversation with a criminal investigator for the Department of Justice on Wednesday and provided details of the lawsuit and evidence he has to back up his claims. Fired: Bennett Barlyn alleged he was fired because he complained about Gov. Chris Christie (photographed) officials dropping indictments against Christie's political allies . Barlyn said the investigator asked him about an allegation in his lawsuit that Russo told a reporter that Christie would step in and 'have this whole thing thrown out' after he was accused of misconduct and indicted by a grand jury in 2010. Russo has denied making the statement, and Christie, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, has denied any involvement in the dropping of the indictment. Barlyn reached out last April to New Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman, whose office also is investigating apparently politically motivated George Washington Bridge traffic lane closures by Christie allies. Fishman wrote back to Barlyn in June, according to a letter obtained by The Associated Press, saying, 'It is not apparent on the face of your submission that there have been potential violations of federal criminal law warranting this Office's review.' Fishman directed Barlyn to contact one of the office's investigators 'to further assess whether your allegations may implicate such statutes.' Lawsuit: The lawsuit claims that the indictments of former county undersheriff Michael Russo (left) and then-Sheriff Deborah Trout (right) were dropped by the state attorney general's office because the investigation exposed the possible involvement of a campaign donor to Christie . A spokesman for Fishman declined to comment on Thursday. Barlyn said the investigator who met with him, who wasn't the one to whom Fishman referred him, asked about New Jersey's official misconduct statutes and whether there were corresponding federal statutes. Christie's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday, but in 2012 it denied any involvement in the case. 'This is conspiracy theory stuff from someone who is obviously casting a wide net with hopes of coming up with a big fish or something,' Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said at the time. 'It's nonsense.' Christie is not named in the lawsuit, which seeks damages including lost wages. The lawsuit says the indictment against then-Sheriff Deborah Trout and the two subordinates was dropped by the state attorney general's office because the investigation exposed the possible involvement of a campaign donor to Christie. Barlyn, a former state deputy attorney general who worked on the county's prosecution of former NBA star Jayson Williams, says in the lawsuit he argued hundreds of appeals for the attorney general's office in front of the Appellate Division and state Supreme Court and consistently received top performance reviews. His problems began, the filing says, when the attorney general's office stepped in to take over the case against Trout, Russo, and investigator John Falat Jr. The 2010 indictment against the trio charged official misconduct, falsification of employment records, and other offenses. Nonsense: Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said Barlyn's claims are 'nonsense' and 'conspiracy theory stuff' Among the allegations in Barlyn's lawsuit was that Falat and Russo produced fake law enforcement ID cards, one of which was given to Celgene Corp. executive Robert Hariri, a contributor to Christie's campaign who served on his transition team. Hariri was not charged. The attorney general's office took over the case and dropped the indictment several months later, citing 'legal and factual deficiencies,' an unusual move considering the grand jury had effectively given its stamp of approval. There was no attempt to present the charges again to the grand jury to correct the deficiencies, Barlyn says. Barlyn was suspended soon after and later was terminated, the result, according to the filing, of his telling county acting prosecutor Dermot O'Grady he felt the dismissal was politically motivated. Barlyn's meeting with investigators was first reported Thursday by the International Business Times.","Bennett Barlyn alleged he was fired because he complained about Gov.

"Probation officer Stacey Karen McCarthy, 31, (pictured outside Isleworth Crown Court) has been jailed for a year for protecting her criminal lover . A 'brilliant' probation officer has been jailed after she fell in love with a prolific drug-addict burglar she was supervising - protecting him from police after another break-in and putting him up in her home. Criminal justice graduate Stacey Karen McCarthy, 31, of Greenford, London, has three degrees, including a Masters - but her promising career has been destroyed as she starts her twelve-month prison sentence. As she was jailed boyfriend Stephen Sullivan, 35, abused the investigating police officers in the public gallery, tried to head butt two of them and received six weeks imprisonment for contempt of court. She pleaded guilty to assisting an offender between January 30 and February 23 last year, for failing to notify the police of Sullivan's mobile phone number and allowing him to stay at her home. She also pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office between January 1 and February 23 last year for conducting an inappropriate relationship with Sullivan while employed as a supervising probation officer and providing him with a mobile phone. Prosecutor Lyall Thompson told Isleworth Crown Court today McCarthy, who was employed by the London Probation Trust since April, 2008, was Sullivan's supervising officer after his release from prison on licence for a burglary conviction. 'He has a very lengthy conviction history and was a high-risk offender, who had completed five years on the prolific offender scheme.' Less than three weeks after his release on December 3, 2013 Sullivan broke in at 7.15am on December 28 to a firm that specialises in security alarms and after causing £400 worth of damage was identified by police on CCTV. He was circulated as wanted on the Police National Computer and as his probation officer McCarthy was asked to assist in locating him. McCarthy pictured outside Isleworth Crown Court with boyfriend Stephen Sullivan - both were jailed today . On January 26, last year McCarthy activated a mobile phone and gave it to Sullivan. 'She deliberately withheld information to the police about the use of this phone and implied that it was being used by her and not Sullivan,' explained Mr. Thompson. 'As a direct consequence police did not use cell-site analysis and an opportunity to locate and arrest him was lost.' While McCarthy was holidaying in Egypt in February she allowed Sullivan to live in her house and he used her Fiat car. 'This car was used in a burglary in Hertfordshire on February 17 and two associates of Sullivan were arrested.' Sullivan then ransacked four offices in Canada House, Ruislip, causing a huge amount of damage and taking a laptop. McCarthy was arrested when she returned from Egypt and was suspended by her bosses and Sullivan was eventually captured by police on April 14. 'When he appeared at Harrow Crown Court on the twentieth of May she talked her way into the cells to visit him, a visit she would not normally have had.' Sullivan later received two years probation with a drug rehabilitation requirement. McCarthy was questioned by police on May 28. 'She stated after her arrest she got sucked in by him and a sexual relationship began.' The pair struck up a relationship after McCarthy (pictured) was appointed as Sullivan's supervising probation officer following his release from prison . Matthew Rowcliffe defending said: 'She's always, from a young age, had a desire to understand why others get involved in crime and to steer others away from crime.' Determined McCarthy beat 'fierce competition' to land her dream job and drove through a new initiative called 'Community Hub' and kept two 'prolific offenders' out of trouble where colleagues had failed. She supervised 'Prolific Priority Offenders' and knew it was against the rules to have inappropriate relationships with offenders. 'A relationship did develop despite the obvious impropriety and her actions were not carefully calculated, but were impulsive actions from a strong emotional attachment and the relationship continued.' The fact Sullivan has only failed one drug test while on probation was hailed as another success for McCarthy. 'This reflects the genuine talent Miss McCarthy has to help others change.' She was forced to resign her position. 'She will never be able to return to that occupation, that vocation,' added Mr Rowcliffe. 'Given her ability and talents this case represents a grave loss to the probation service.' Judge Aidan Marron QC told her: 'You are clearly a well-educated woman from a good home and with advantages like that this should not have happened.' Sullivan shouted at officers as they left court: 'You're f***ing scumbags,' and was asked to return by Judge Marron, who ordered his arrest. 'I'm heartbroken, I've lost my girlfriend. Don't ruin all the good work that's been done, this could put me over the edge,' he told the judge before being handcuffed after a struggle and taken to the cells. Crack addict Sullivan, who has a two-decade old habit and has spent fourteen of the last nineteen years in custody, was brought back up and admitted contempt of court. Judge Marron jailed him for six weeks, explaining: 'My usual way of dealing with outbursts is to ignore them, but this I regard as being well over the top. 'It was a nasty explosion - I could see people in the public gallery were upset and you head butted two police officers.' There will be no further action against Sullivan and the judge added: 'Consider yourself very fortunate indeed.'","'Brilliant' probation officer Stacey McCarthy, 31, 'destroyed' her career .

Grim announcement: Mr Abbott said he and his deputy Julie Bishop will fight to hold their positions . Mr Abbott appeared decidedly more happy visiting a factory on Friday morning . Motion: Luke Simpkins, pictured with potential leadership contender Malcolm Turnbull, has announced he will move for a federal Liberal leadership spill . Text: This is the full email Luke Simpkins sent to all of his parliamentary colleagues . Ms Bishop's support could be pivotal to the Liberal leadership. Scott Morrison has ruled himself out of the top job but Malcolm Turnbull has not. Mr Abbott said the MPs who called for the spill - Mr Simpkins and fellow backbencher Don Randall - were perfectly entitled to call for a challenge. However, he said: 'They are asking the Party Room to vote out the people that the electorate voted in in September 2013.' Mr Simpkins, a little-known West Australian MP, announced he had moved a motion to topple the Prime Minister in an email to his Liberal colleagues earlier this afternoon. He said that the knighthood of Prince Philip, issued by Mr Abbott on Australia Day, was the final straw for him. In his email to his Liberal colleagues he wrote: 'The knighthood issue was for many the final proof of a disconnection with the people,' Simpkins wrote in the email. 'I think that we must bring this to a head, and test the support of the leadership in the party room. 'I have therefore submitted to the Chief Government Whip a motion to spill the leadership positions of the Federal Parliamentary Liberal party.' Chief Government Whip Phillip Ruddock said the matter had been listed for discussion for the Tuesday party room meeting. Trouble: Prime Minister Tony Abbott will reportedly face a leadership challenge on Tuesday in Canberra . Meanwhile, Tasmanian Liberal MP Andrew Nikolic has branded the move to challenge Mr Tony Abbott as disappointing and divisive. In an email to backbench colleague Mr Simpkins,  Mr Nikolic dismissed the move as the 'ill-disciplined and self-interested behaviours that the Australian people explicitly rejected in 2013'. The email was copied to other coalition MPs and senators. The note reportedly reads: 'Luke, Your actions are disappointing and divisive. 'In my view you are repeating the ill-disciplined and self-interested behaviours that the Australian people explicitly rejected in 2013. 'You do not have my support for this. 'I will be arguing strongly against your motion and in support of what I believe is a clear majority of colleagues and constituents who prefer stability and unity of purpose.' Prime Minister Tony Abbott was taking a selfie with worker Emerson Smith during his visit the Timbermate factory in the Melbourne suburb of Mitcham on Friday while some MPs plotted a spill . Big lift: Mr Abbott will face a leadership challenge at the Liberal Party room meeting on Tuesday . The leadership spill has been motioned ahead of the first major party room meeting of 2015 on Tuesday . It's the first Liberal leadership challenge since 2009. After the internal fallout from the-then Liberal Party and Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull’s support for the Rudd Government’s ETS plan in 2009 (which split the Coalition because of the National Party’s opposition to it) there was a three-way spill, involving Mr Turnbull, Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey. In the end, Abbott claiming the leadership by one vote over Turnbull, 42 votes to 41. No one has put up their hand to contest Mr Abbott, but Mr Turnbull would not rule out a challenge on Thursday evening. During in an appearance on the Today Show on Friday morning, Education Minister Christopher Pyne said he 'hoped' Mr Abbott would have the votes. He later put his comments down to a slip of the tongue because he was ‘tired’, during a second interview on Sky News once he had returned to his home city of Adelaide. Federal opposition leader Bill Shorten during a visit to Dolphins Long Day Care Centre in Brighton-Le-Sands, Sydney . Shorten spent part of today playing with children and at the day care centre amid . Pyne said: ‘I don’t know well there could a vote every Tuesday… I don’t know if there will be a vote on Tuesday.’ ‘My job is to find out what my colleagues are thinking… I’ve been talking to people, obviously there are some people who think there should be a vote,’ he added. ‘I can’t rule it out. I can tell you this though I will not be moving a vote on Tuesday in the party room.’ Probed by host Karl Stefanovic on whether the Prime Minister still has the numbers to retain leadership, Pyne said: ‘I assume the party room knows the worst thing we could possibly do is change the leadership now we have to support the Prime Minister. He later tried to clarify what he said. 'At the first available opportunity I've come straight to your studios from the airport, I am clearing up what I think is an unfortunate misinterpretation of remarks that I made this morning,' he said. 'Perhaps because I'm usually so ebullient, because it was six o'clock in the morning and I was tired rather than effusive and ebullient maybe people have misinterpreted my position,' he said. Senior Labor figure Anthony Albanese, who was also on the show, retorted: ‘When you start having senior people who can’t say that the Prime Minister has the numbers then it’s over.’ As politics remained focussed on the government’s leadership crisis, Labor Opposition Leader Bill Shorten spent part of today playing with children and toys at a day care centre in Sydney. Tony Abbott has reportedly been warned to dump his chief of staff Peta Credlin if he wants to salvage his position .

"Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress will face some resistance in a vote to authorize President Barack Obama's war against Islamic State militants despite international outrage over video of militants beheading their captives and burning one alive. War authorizations are among the most difficult issues confronting members of Congress. Several Democrats will be reluctant to approve new war powers unless there is a clear deadline or some way to pay for the military operation. Some Republicans, strong foes of the president, will object to giving Obama the authority. Obama is poised in coming days to ask Congress for new authority to use U.S. military force against the ISIS terror army, the White House said Thursday. But the top House Republican warned it won't be easy to pass the measure. Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said it will be up to the president to rally support from lawmakers and the public. President Obama is getting his act together and plans to ask Congress for a new bombing permission-slip, following months of his relying on war powers resolutions approved 13 and 14 years ago . House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, is not making any guarantees and says Obama's request 'is not going to be an easy lift' after months of acting unilaterally . 'His actions are going to be an important part of trying for us to get the votes to actually pass an authorization,' Boehner said Thursday. 'This is not going to be an easy lift.' In the U.S. battle against ISIS, Obama has been relying on congressional authorizations that President George W. Bush used to justify military action after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Critics say the White House's use of post-9/11 congressional authorizations is a legal stretch, at best. Obama has insisted that he had the legal authority to send U.S. troops to train and assist Iraqi security forces, and to launch airstrikes since September against targets in Iraq and Syria. Now, the administration wants to get a new so-called Authorization for the Use of Military Force, or AUMF, with bipartisan support from Congress. 'The president believes it sends a very powerful signal to the American people, to our allies, and even to our enemies, that the United States of America is united behind this strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, using an alternative acronym for the 'Islamic State' terror group. Republicans generally want a broader authorization of military action against the militants than Democrats have been willing to consider. Obama has said he does not intend to deploy U.S. combat troops, though many Republicans believe that option ought to be available. 'I have always believed that when it comes to fighting a war that Congress should not tie the president's hands,' Boehner said. Earnest declined to discuss specific provisions being considered, such as how long the authorization will last, what geographical areas it will cover and whether it will allow for ground troops. He said details were still being worked out with lawmakers from both parties. Top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi of California said talks with the administration are focusing on an authorization that would last three years, with other issues still being debated. Pelosi told journalists it will be a challenge for Democrats, the White House and Republicans to forge an agreement, but that she ultimately expects one to be reached. 'I'm not saying anybody's come to an agreement on it,' Pelosi said. 'I think it's going to be a challenge, but we will have it.' Pelosi said she hopes Congress will repeal the 2002 congressional authorization for the war in Iraq but retain the 2001 authorization for military action in Afghanistan. Earnest said the White House also supports repeal of the Iraq authorization replaced by the new authorization. Late last year, Secretary of State John Kerry said whatever new authorization Congress passes should not limit U.S. military action to Iraq and Syria or prevent the president from deploying ground troops if he later deems them necessary. He also said that if the new authorization had a time limit, there should be a provision for it to be renewed. BARBARIANS!: ISIS . posted a video online this week showing the intentional burning death of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh . LINE THEM UP: ISISis known for its brutal massacres of 'infidels' – including Muslims who don't back their rigid brand of Islam . SHOWING ITS AGE: Obama's authority for airstrikes against ISIS is a 2002 authorization that President George W. Bush got for his war in Iraq . Islamic State militants released a grisly video this week of a Jordanian Air Force pilot being burned alive inside a cage. Pelosi said that the U.S. should 'move quickly' to steer military aid to Jordan, which has stepped up a campaign against the militants, including a series of airstrikes in Syria. California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence panel, already introduced authorization legislation rather than wait for Obama's version. His bill would authorize the use of force against ISIS in Iraq and Syria for three years, but prohibit the use of ground forces in a combat mission in either nation. He has said if the president later decided to deploy ground troops, he could return to Congress to ask for new authority. 'It is my hope that the administration will be willing to accept important limits in a new authorization as well as the sunset or repeal of the old AUMFs, as this will be necessary to ensure strong bipartisan support and meet the goals the president set last summer of refining and repealing the prior authorizations,' Schiff said in a statement.","The administration wants a new so-called 'Authorization for the Use of Military Force' and expects bipartisan support from Congress .

"A selfless seven-year-old donated his £2.50 pocket money to nine-year-old cancer victim and his sister after raiders stole their birthday money. Kind Jonah Lewis overheard his parents talking about the cruel break-in at their friends' home. He went away and found the £2 coin and 50p his parents had given him for sweets and sellotaped them to a card with a message. Generous seven-year-old Jonah Lewis donated his £2.50 pocket money to the Sonny Nygate, aged nine, and his sister Lois, seven, after their home was targeted by raiders . Selfless Jonah Lewis sellotaped his pocket money to a handwritten note to victims Sony and Lois in which he said 'I am very sorry' He wrote: 'I am very sorry about the robbery and that you ar upset. Its a horrible thing to steal a child's birthay money because I am sad for you hear is £2.50 in the envelope to replace the birthday money and the money is my sweet money that I didn't spend hoap you be OK, and police will catch the robbers and take them into Jail.' The money went to cancer victim Sonny Nygate, aged nine, and his sister Lois, seven, whose three bedroom home in Ilford, Essex, worth around £370,000, was burgled on January 25. Burglars stole birthday money belonging to Sonny, nine and his sister, Lois, seven, during a break-in at their home . The raiders made off with several hundred pounds in cash, which included the children's birthday and Christmas money. They also grabbed jewellery and watches from the bedroom of parents Lloyd, 42, and Laura and trashed the house. Jonah heard his parents Monica, 42, and Paul, 44, discussing the burglary and told them he wanted to donate his sweet money. Proud Monica, from Saffron Walden, Essex, said: 'I saw it on Facebook that friends of ours had been burgled. 'I was talking about it with my husband that night, I just said 'did you hear about it' and we were discussing it. 'I didn't even realise Jonah was listening and at the end he came to us and said 'I don't want to spend my sweet money', which we had given to him a couple of days earlier. 'He hadn't spent it yet, and he said he would like to give it to the family. He said they must be very upset because of what happened.' Mum-of-one Monica added: 'It was such a lovely thing to do, he is a very kind and generous person. 'Every time we are out and he sees someone on the street he'll always ask us to give them some money, which we do. 'They have been through a lot as well as Sonny suffered from Lymphoma disease, but he is now in remission. 'I think Jonah has a soft spot for him because of that.' Laura, 40, said she burst into tears when she received the money and card. The admin worker said: 'After the burglary I was so down, they had wrecked the house, stamped on my wedding tiara and stole money that was for my children. 'I was really really low I had to take a week of work. I received the letter and I was just so overwhelmed that a boy of seven could do something so nice. 'It was just so thoughtful. Our families go back years but he doesn't know my son really well. He probably knows of him more through him being ill. 'It was just such a lovely thing to do, we were all so grateful to him, it restored our faith in humanity.' Sonny has been in remission from cancer since 2011. Essex Police are appealing for information about the burglary. The letter read: . I am very sorry about the robbery and that you ar upset.

"Malia Obama has been visiting New York City universities. The 16-year-old First Daughter, who graduates next year, was spotted at NYU campus with her mother Michelle Obama and Secret Service personnel on Friday morning. Later the group was spotted at her father's alma mater: Columbia University. Following in her father's footsteps? Malia Obama visited two New York universities with her mother Michelle . It comes after tours of schools on the West Coast, including Stanford University, where former First Daughter Chelsea Clinton was educated, and the University of California at Berkeley. Malia, a high school junior, was given a private view of NYU's Goddard residential halls, with unaware students told the elevators would be down for 10 minutes. At one point, she was spotted walking with a group of girls her age, seemingly on a group tour. Believed to be an aspiring filmmaker, she no doubt harbors an interest in the Tisch campus, NYU's film academy. At lunchtime, crowds swarmed as the First Lady and First Daughter dropped into student cafe Community Food and Juice. Touring: At one point the First Daughter was spotted walking with a group of girls her age at a campus . Bite to eat: Crowds swarmed with cameras as Malia and Michelle dropped by a student hot spot for lunch . Malia went into 11th grade this fall at the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C.

And the President is evidently already contemplating the moment he will have to say goodbye to his first-born. 'I've got to practice, because Malia is graduating in two years,' he told a high school graduation last summer. 'I'm trying to get used to not choking up and crying and embarrassing her. So this is sort of my trial run here.'","Malia, a high school junior, visited halls of residence and local cafe .

"Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water... With several beaches in Newcastle already closed due to rough weather, a shark sighting has prompted lifeguards north of Sydney to give swimmers a double reminder about taking the plunge. A 1.8 metre shark has been spotted off Bar Beach on Friday morning, while images have emerged of what appears to be shark bites from nearby Merewether Beach on Thursday night. Scroll down for video . A bodysurfer posted an Instagram photo of his alleged shark bite on his leg on Thursday . A 1.8 metre shark has been spotted off Bar Beach on Friday morning . A fellow bodysurfer, who goes by the username 'thefoof', responded with a photo of her own wound . Several Newcastle beaches had already been closed on Friday by lifeguards due to rough seas, but signs have since been erected warning of shark sightings. A City of Newcastle Council spokesperson said the person bitten by a shark on Thursday appears to have minor injuries to the leg. 'We're getting all of this third hand because it was not reported to our lifeguards, they were off duty at the time, but someone was reportedly bitten by a bull shark, or the person thought it was a two foot (61cm) bull shark,' she said on Friday. 'I have also seen a picture on social media of the person's leg with a few little holes in it. So not to downplay it because any kind of shark bite is serious, but it's very minor.' Images have emerged of what appears to be shark bites from nearby Merewether Beach (pictured) on Thursday night . This comes as a bodysurfer posted an Instagram photo of his alleged shark bite on his leg on Thursday. 'Got me! Tagged by #Bruce well, maybe his little brother. #sharkbite,' Pedroflores captioned the photo. It was soon followed by surf photographer Rod Owen's close up image of the injury. 'Remember when your mum said don't swim after dark! @pedroflores getting very lucky with a nibble from a pesky bull #shark at #merewether beach, #Newcastle this evening. Glad your (sic) ok son!' he wrote on Instagram. A fellow bodysurfer, who goes by the username 'thefoof', responded with a photo of her own wound. 'Now we've both been bitten by sharks @pedroflores #sharkbite #jesush #poopyopants,' she wrote. Beaches around Newcastle were shut for a record nine days in January after repeated sightings of a five-metre great white shark, nicknamed Bruce. Lifeguards will continue to warn swimmers about the recent sightings and patrol on jet skis to keep an eye out for further activity. '(But) usually what happens is the shark will take off the same day,' the council spokesperson said.","Several beaches have been closed in Newcastle, north of Sydney, due to rough weather .

"International Development Secretary Justine Greening halted more aid going to Rwanda . Britain yesterday halted £21million in aid payments to Rwanda over human rights concerns. The surprise move comes only a few weeks after David Cameron called the African country a ‘continuing success story’. Announcing the policy U-turn, Justine Greening said there was ‘credible and compelling’ evidence that Rwanda was arming a violent revolt in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo. Her predecessor as International Development Secretary, Andrew Mitchell, had controversially resumed aid payments to Rwanda in September, saying it had ended its support for the so-called M23 rebels in the DRC. The Commons international development committee said yesterday that Mr Mitchell’s decision was inexplicable, given the weight of evidence suggesting Rwandan president Paul Kagame has been backing the revolt for months. A devastating report by the United Nations last month detailed Rwanda’s central role in a conflict that has left a trail of death and destruction in the eastern DRC and forced half a million people from their homes. Miss Greening also announced that Britain will give an extra £18million to the DRC to help deal with the humanitarian crisis there. The decision to suspend the aid programme is embarrassing for Mr Cameron, who has forged a friendship with Kagame and invited him to address the Conservative Party conference in 2007. In October the Prime Minister mounted a robust defence of Mr Mitchell, telling MPs: ‘I am clear Rwanda has been, and continues to be, a success story of a country that has gone from genocide and disaster to being a role model for development and lifting people out of poverty. ‘I am proud of the fact the last Government, and this Government, have continued to invest in that success.’ 'Invest in success': David Cameron shakes hands with President Kagame at a meeting in Kigali, Rwanda, in 2007 . Britain suspended the last tranche of £16million of aid in July when the UN published its interim findings. But Mr Mitchell, a personal friend of Kagame, reinstated the payments on his last day as International Development Secretary. Justifying the decision he told Mr Cameron in a letter: ‘Reporting shows that [Rwanda’s] practical support to the M23 has now ended.’ Mr Mitchell denies acting as a ‘rogue minister’ and has stressed Rwanda’s good record of using aid money to help its people. Conflict: A Congolese policeman attempts to stop people entering a base where UNICEF and International Medical Corps workers were handing out high nutrition cookies north of Goma in 2008 . But in a report on his decision . yesterday MPs on the international development committee said: ‘We are . not privy to all the information and advice upon which he made this . assessment but, on the basis of the other evidence we received, we do . not understand how he reached the conclusion that support for the M23 . had ceased.’ In Opposition the Tories developed a close relationship with Kagame  in an attempt to lose their ‘nasty party’ image. Mr Mitchell, Mr Cameron and dozens of . Tory MPs travelled to the tiny east African country to carry out . voluntary work and display their caring credentials. But human rights groups have become . increasingly concerned by the actions of the Kagame regime in recent . years – at home and abroad. Kagame, who was re-elected in 2010 . with 93 per cent of the vote, has been accused of suppressing political . opponents and journalists in Rwanda. Since the start of the year the . country has also been accused of masterminding the M23 mutiny, which is . led by Bosco Ntaganda, a Congolese warlord and indicted war criminal. Rwanda denies involvement in the conflict. Kagame’s regime is heavily dependent . on foreign aid, which accounts for a third of its annual budget. Britain . is the country’s biggest foreign donor and this year alone is due to . give £75million. The Prime Minister’s spokesman denied the decision to reinstate aid in September was a mistake. ‘We stand by the decision that we made . to release the last tranche of funding,’ he added. ‘This is our . approach to the aid budget. We keep decisions under review.’ Mr Cameron raised concerns with Kagame . when he spoke to him by telephone a few weeks ago, according to No 10. David Mepham, UK director of Human Rights Watch, said the decision to . suspend aid to Rwanda was long overdue. He said aid should not be reinstated . until Rwanda had shown it was prepared to honour agreements to respect . human rights, adding: ‘For years, these principles have been breached by . Rwanda without triggering any response from the UK Government.’ Robert Oxley of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It’s appalling that British taxpayers’ money has gone . directly to a government involved in a proxy war that has brought untold . misery to hundreds of thousands of people. ‘This announcement leaves a huge question mark over why DfID, and specifically Andrew Mitchell, reinstated the aid programme.’ British . aid to Rwanda is ‘funding a dictator’ and worsening the misery of his . victims, a former senior aide to the African state’s president claimed . last night. The . £270million of aid earmarked for the  country over the next three years . is ‘sustaining a bad regime’, said David Himbara, who was private . secretary to President Paul Kagame until two years ago. Kagame’s . regime is alleged to be funding and arming a bloody rebellion in the . neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, in a conflict  marked by . the use of child soldiers and widespread rape and murder.","International Development Justine Greening announces she will not hand the money over next month .

"A herdsman in China has discovered a huge nugget of gold worth at least $250,000. File photo . A herdsman struck gold after stumbling upon a nugget weighing almost eight kilograms In China - and estimated to be worth at least $250,000 (£160,000). Berek Sawut, an ethnic Kazakh, discovered the 7.85kg chunk of precious metal 'practically lying on bare ground', Chinese state media reported. But the report did not reveal whether the herder would be able to keep his newfound riches. He described the lump as 'random-shaped' and about 23cm long, 18cm at its widest and up to 8cm thick. It was estimated to be worth 1.6million yuan ($255,000), Xinhua news agency said, assuming it is 80% pure. Local gold price expert, Zhu Xinfeng, said natural lumps of the precious metal can fetch several times more than the refined variety. The discovery was made in the far western region of Xinjiang - a vast and diverse area bordering Central Asia and abundant in natural resources. The nugget was found in Qinghe county, part of Altay (which means 'gold' in Mongolian) prefecture, the report said. The area boasts striking scenery, and has an ethnically diverse population including the Kazakhs, Uighurs and Han, China's majority.

In one, a jihadist kills himself after repeatedly re-firing his mortar without giving it time to cool down. Eventually, one round blows up in the chamber, killing him instantly. Other footage shows fighters being taken out by snipers or burning to death when their trucks are hit by airstrikes. YouTube user As-salamu Alaykum, who posted one compilation clip, said: 'Fighting Jihad for ISIS is nothing more then joining a murder squad killing innocent Muslims, Christians and others. 'Most of the victims are women and children. If you are a Muslim and think that the Prophet will reward you for this, you're up for a big surprise. Hell is what awaits you all. 'In the meantime, enjoy this video with real footage of jihadists killing themselves because they're just plain stupid.'

It comes as Queen Rania of Jordan led protests in the capital Amman this morning as thousands took to the streets after Friday prayers to urge King Abdullah II to step up airstrikes against the Islamic State to avenge the brutal murder of pilot Moaz al-Kasaesbeh. Crowds massed near the city's main Husseini mosque, then marched chanting 'Death to Daesh', using an Arabic acronym for the terror group, in the latest sign of mounting public anger. The rally came three days after Islamic State released a video purporting to show Kasaesbeh being burnt alive in a cage as masked militants in camouflage uniforms looked on.

The act has been widely condemned as among the most sickening ever committed to film and has sent waves of revulsion across the Middle East. Jordan's royal family have led the anti-ISIS protests in the country, with King Abdullah making an emotional visit to the pilot's grieving relatives in his tribal home village yesterday. Queen Rania broke down in tears as she embraced and comforted his young widow. Jordan said its warplanes had launched dozens of new airstrikes yesterday against the Islamic State group after vowing a harsh response. Jordan's Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh warned this was just the start of its offensive against the terror group, vowing to 'go after them with everything that we have'.

"In the money: Sue James is back at Derby Hospitals Foundation Trust after quitting for 24 hours . An NHS chief who tried to gag a whistleblower has claimed an extra £155,000 by ‘retiring’ for just 24 hours. Sue James, 58, used a loophole to bank the tax-free bonus as her Trust declared millions of pounds in losses. She was then rehired a day later to continue earning her salary of almost £200,000 a year. The executive – who once offered £250,000 of public money to silence a surgeon who spoke out about poor patient care – was last night branded ‘morally reprehensible’. She faces being investigated by watchdogs and could be fired under new laws, if found to have been involved in ‘serious misconduct or mismanagement’. Incredibly, she has refused to apologise or hand back the money, maintaining she is ‘fully entitled’ to the payout. The case is revealed today by the Mail as Sir Robert Francis QC prepares to publish a long-awaited report into whistleblowing in the NHS. It is expected to highlight the extraordinary ways in which whistleblowers have been persecuted into keeping quiet while bosses have been hugely rewarded. Tory MP Charlotte Leslie, who sits on the health select committee, last night said: ‘The disgusting audacity of this is beyond words. ‘People who do the right thing in the NHS get fired and lose their livelihoods and careers and people who do the wrong thing jump on the lucrative managerial merry-go-round, parasiting money off the NHS that should be going to front-line staff and patients.’ Andrew Percy, a Conservative MP who also sits on the health select committee, added: ‘It is morally repugnant. At a time of intense pressure on the NHS senior managers should not be profiteering by retiring and then returning to do the same job. Most people would find it disgusting.’ James, who lives with her husband Peter, 60, in a £500,000 cottage in rural Shropshire, has been chief executive of Derby Hospitals Foundation Trust since 2011. The pay package came even though her failing Trust lost £15.7million, declaring a financial deficit for the first time. Scroll down for video . Just months earlier, regulator Monitor demanded immediate improvements to the trust. On top of her salary of more than £190,000, she claims about £3,000 a year in expenses and was awarded between £152,500 and £155,000 in pension-related benefits. She claimed the huge tax-free sum by retiring on March 30, 2014. She was re-hired 24 hours later, meaning she could receive her pension while still earning her gargantuan salary. The supposed retirement and re-instatement was never announced, but buried in the small print in the hospital’s accounts. The chief executive job that she refilled a day later was never advertised. Criticised: Tory MP Charlotte Leslie, left, who sits on the health select committee, last night said: ‘The disgusting audacity of this is beyond words.' MP Andrew Percy, right, said it was 'morally repugnant' James may also have broken the rules of her pension. Under certain circumstances she should only have been allowed to come back to work after retirement if she worked for a maximum of 16 hours a week for the first month. Derby Hospitals never reported that its chief executive was working part-time for a month. Neither James or the Trust would say why her retirement was never announced, why they never advertised for a new chief executive or why James was then reinstated without telling the public. They would not say whether she worked part-time for a month last year. James did not respond to a request to apologise or to give the money back and would not comment on calls for her to resign. In 2013, former actress Sue James described her role as chief executive at Derby Hospitals Trust as ‘like living a soap opera’. She added that if you are ‘an adrenalin junkie’ a hospital is a wonderful place to work because ‘you are touching the whole range of human emotions every day’. She was previously chief executive at Walsall Hospital for seven years from 2003, where she was accused of overseeing the ‘persecution’ of whistleblower Dr David Drew, head of the hospital’s paediatric department. After telling James about his concerns about safety, Dr Drew was eventually dismissed for failing to obey orders and accused of using religious references at work. James offered him £247,000 in public funds and a good reference to go quietly. She joked it would be a ‘nice birthday present’. After refusing, he was sacked. Months later, James became chief executive of Derby Hospitals Foundation Trust. Dr Drew has now taken legal action to have James removed from her job. Last night, he compared his former boss to a ‘second-hand car dealer’. He said: ‘Sue James is on such a big salary already. Why does she need more?’ Derby Hospitals Foundation Trust said: ‘Mrs James has shown herself to be an excellent chief executive. In accordance with HMRC regulations our chief executive, in the same way as many other individuals, has chosen to draw on her pension entitlement early and continue to work.’ NHS set to be criticised over treatment of whistleblowers as new safeguards are unveiled . Professor Joseph Meirion Thomas, pictured, was put on two weeks’ gardening leave by the Royal Marsden Hospital in London after he wrote critical articles about the NHS . The NHS is set to be heavily criticised over the victimisation of staff who dared to blow the whistle on poor practice. Leading barrister Sir Robert Francis – who carried out two reports into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal – will unveil a series of recommendations on Wednesday, designed to protect staff who speak out. His report has been delayed by two months after his inquiry team was deluged by comments from thousands of worried staff. The review team has received 17,500 online responses and 600 by post – although some may have been in touch more than once. Last month, MPs said that despite some improvements, many staff have been put off by the experience of others. A report by the Commons health select committee said: ‘The treatment of whistleblowers is a stain on the reputation of the NHS and has led to unwarranted, inexcusable pain for the courageous individuals affected.’ Sir Robert’s review into whistleblowing was ordered by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last summer over fears that those who want to raise concerns are staying silent over fears of being bullied or forced out of their job. Although such treatment is particularly associated with the target-driven culture under Labour, there are still cases where those who speak out are being treated shockingly. In January a senior cancer doctor was suspended by his trust for writing critical articles about the Health Service. Professor Joseph Meirion Thomas was put on two weeks’ gardening leave by the Royal Marsden Hospital in London. Last year, the Mail highlighted the case of cardiologist Dr Raj Matu, whose NHS trust spent £10million trying to silence him after he warned of patients dying on overcrowded wards. He was suspended from Coventry’s Walgrave Hospital in 2000 and later sacked, but finally vindicated in April when a judge ruled he had been unfairly treated. In 2010, Gary Walker was dismissed as chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust after raising fears that a Labour drive to meet targets compromised safety. He claims a £500,000 taxpayer-funded gagging order was used to stop him speaking out. Two years ago, after the trust he ran and several others were warned about high mortality rates, he broke his silence.","Sue James used loophole to bank bonus as Trust declared massive losses .

"At one time those with a penchant for chocolate and sweets could safely be categorised as being on the lardy side of the health barometer. However, manufacturers are tapping in to our love for treats to push foods that could actually improve health. Harvey Nichols is reporting remarkable sales for the chocolate brand Ohso, which delivers large amounts of ‘friendly’ bacteria to the gut to improve health and digestion. While a web food store is offering a new high protein sweet which claims to help build rippling muscles rather than flab. Healthy treat: Ohso chocolate bars, which delivers large amounts of ‘friendly’ bacteria to the gut to improve health and digestion, are rapidly increasing in popularity . Ohso sells its chocolate bars in multiple packs and actively encourages consumers to eat one every day of the week, just as they might an apple or some healthy green veg. Each one contains over one billion live Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium bacteria and is said to be three times more effective in delivering it to the gut than the popular yoghurt and milk alternatives. The firm claims that, like the popular probiotic yoghurt and milk products, these bacteria help to positively influence healthy gastrointestinal functions and the immune system. More than this, the bars, which contain 63 calories, are being sold on the basis that they have many other health benefits. The spokesman said: ‘Cocoa flavanols, the specific group of polyphenols which are abundantly present in the cocoa bean, have been shown to possess several beneficial effects and play an important role in supporting our health and well-being. ‘They are natural and powerful antioxidants and help to strengthen your body’s own natural defence against free radicals when under oxidative stress. Furthermore, cocoa flavanols have shown protective effects on several health parameters, such as cardiovascular health, cognitive function and skin quality.’ Ohso sells its chocolate bars in multiple packs and actively encourages consumers to eat one every day of the week, just as they might an apple or some healthy green veg . Good for you chocolate: Each one contains over one billion 'good' bacteria and is said to be three times more effective in delivering it to the gut than the popular yoghurt and milk alternatives . Cocoa and chocolate also contain a unique form saturated fat which, according to recent research, has a neutral effect on the production of bad cholesterol and could possibly promote the creation of good cholesterol. The bars also contain many B-complex vitamins, needed for releasing energy and creating the body’s building blocks, as well vitamins D and E. The idea of eating chocolate being a positive health choice has been fuelled by the fact that British Olympian and gold medal winning medallist, Laura Trott, has become a brand ambassador for what she calls her ‘guilt free’ treat. At last: Eating the chocolate can be considered 'guilt free' because of its health benefits . Co-founder of the company, Andrew Marten, said: ‘There’s always been this perception that if it’s good for you it doesn’t taste good. But we’re the absolutely opposite. This tastes great and fits into a healthy lifestyle. ‘The friendly bacteria help to positively influence healthy gastrointestinal functions and your immune system, digestion and overall health and wellbeing.’ He added: ‘Consumers are becoming increasingly educated and mindful about what they are eating. Now they can enjoy a daily chocolate treat like that is clinically proven to be three times more effective at delivering good bacteria than functional probiotic yoghurt or milk drinks.’ Mr Marten certainly seems to be on to a financial winner after being given the Investec Food & Drink Entrepreneur of the Year Award at the House of Commons last year. Marion Carpentier, Group Food and Hospitality Director at Harvey Nichols said: ‘Sugar free brands such as Ohso are proving highly popular and have bolstered sales in the category by over 30 per cent compared with last year.’ While the bars initially were sold exclusively by the upmarket store, they are now available across the high street in places like Boots or Tesco at £3.99 for a pack of seven. The website MuscleFood.com is also tapping into the trend for healthy treats by launching a pack of 10 chewy sweets which contain a total of 15g of protein, 10g of fibre. Each sweet is a relatively modest 15 calories. The main ingredient is whey protein, which is used by sportsmen, while there is no sugar or gluten. Spokesman Darren Beale said: ‘Keeping fit and leading a healthy lifestyle doesn’t mean you have to eat boring food and lots of salad. ‘We began trialling the products after customers told us they missed things like sweets and would often crave a treat after a workout. These sweets taste the same as any other chewy sweet you would buy, but contain very few calories and lots of protein.’","Chocolate bars that contain 'friendly' bacteria are increasing in popularity .

"Former Daily Mail cartoonist Dick Millington, whose work enthralled and amused generations for more than half a century, has died at the age of 81. The lifelong illustrator won an international audience with characters that ranged from curmudgeonly George Damper in the Mail’s ‘I Don’t Believe It’ strip, to the celebrated Mighty Moth, an insect whose adventures appeared in TV Comic for 25 years. Mr Millington, who wrote most of his storylines as well as illustrating them, also supplied the Mail’s long-running Guinness Book of Records feature until the late 1990s. Former Daily Mail cartoonist Dick Millington, pictured aged 52, drawing for the Guinness Book of Records . He was inspired as a child by superhero and other comics from America – and created his own characters and stories to sell to classmates at a penny a time. At the age of 14 he got a job providing the hand-written lettering for cartoon balloons – but quickly displayed a talent for inventing and drawing his own strips. Mighty Moth was born in 1959, six years after Mr Millington completed National Service in the RAF. It spawned a cartoon portfolio that came to include characters such as Ray Presto, Jolly Roger and the Moonbeans. Millington was also the artist who transported TV’s Basil Brush to comic strip format, and who illustrated a children’s book by Animal Magic television presenter Johnny Morris. Although George Damper bore striking similarities to grumpy Victor Meldrew in BBC TV’s One Foot in the Grave, ‘I Don’t Believe It’ was not the original title for Millington’s comic strip and he had never seen the programme when he created it.

"Russell Brand has taken aim at Tony Abbott and Australia's asylum seeker policies.

Tony, why are there even white people in Australia? How did white people get to Australia?'

"Madewell, the denim-focused younger sister of J. Crew, is to become available in the UK for the first time thanks to a new partnership with Net-a-porter.com. The fashion label, which is hugely popular in the U.S. for its hipster aesthetic and accessible price tag, is currently only available to buy in North America and Japan via its retail stores and website. But from February 25, the new spring/summer 2015 collection will be stocked alongside high-end designer labels at Net-a-porter.com, finally making it shoppable for Brits. Crossing the pond: Madewell, J. Crew's younger sister label, is to be available in the UK via Net-a-porter . Somsack Sikhounmuong, Head of Design at Madewell said in a press release that 'new customers and fans have been requesting Madewell overseas for years. 'You can't beat the edit, presentation and incredible company we 'd be keeping on Net-a-Porter,' he said. Madewell has also joined forces with Nordstrom, which will be selling its wares in stores across the U.S. and online from March 2. The two new partnerships are clear evidence of J. Crew chairman and chief executive Mickey Drexler's fresh focus on the Madewell brand - already successful with profits up 36 per cent to $171.7 million in the past year. Mr Drexler, who acquired the Madewell Label in 2003 before selling it to J. Crew, said in a New York Times interview on Thursday: 'I would like Madewell jeans to be the Levi's of its generation.' Growing up: Since seizing the helm in late 2013, Madewell designer Somsack Sikhounmuong has broadened the denim-focused offering . But he insists that the new partnerships with Net-a-porter and Nordstrom are not the first steps in making Madewell a wholesale-style label. 'As we looked at the availability of our products, we started to look at distribution differently,' he told WWD. 'This, for us, is really a new beginning. I wouldn't call it necessarily a wholesale distribution. I would just call it distribution that makes sense from a customer point of view, from a brand point of view, from a Nordstrom and Net-a-porter point of view. . . 'Where can you buy Madewell and J. Crew? We are not a wholesaler by nature. We have a small distribution. It's scarce.' Mr Sikhounmuong, a former J. Crew designer, who has been heading up the creative team at Madewell for over a year now, can also be credited with the label's financial success. Since seizing the helm, the designer has broadened the denim-focused offering to include more 'grown-up' pieces such as leather jackets, army-inspired jumpsuits and shirts hand-embroidered by Mexican artisans.",The label will be available on Net-a-porter.com from February 25 .
"The BBC is to reveal the names of wealthy businessmen it claims have opened offshore Swiss bank accounts without informing the UK tax authorities.

Exposed: All the names are understood to have come from a computer disc stolen from the banking giant’s Geneva office by a whistleblower and relate to its Swiss subsidiary HSBC Private Bank. (File image) The disc, understood to contain the names of 24,000 clients, was leaked by 43-year-old IT and systems engineer Herve Falciani in 2007, who claimed the way some data was managed at Britain’s biggest bank would help tax evaders. He said his suggested reforms were rejected by bosses. Some of the data has since been passed to France, Italy, Spain and Germany, which have pursued claims for up to £180million in lost revenue. Four years ago, HMRC targeted some 6,000 UK-based Swiss bank account holders who may not have declared income and gains from foreign accounts. Officials secured their first high-profile prosecution using details from the disc in 2012 after Berkshire property developer Michael Shanly was estimated to have evaded some £430,000 in inheritance tax. The latest purge by the taxman – and due to be exposed by Panorama – is said to involve a list of 400 high-profile businessmen.

"Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott is facing a leadership challenge triggered by his decision to award a knighthood to the Duke of Edinburgh. The Liberal Party leader came to power with a stunning election victory just 15 months ago but has been under increasing pressure because of poor showings in opinion polls. And Mr Abbott - a staunch monarchist - was ridiculed for his decision to award a knighthood to Prince Philip on Australia’s National Day last month. Ridiculed: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) decided to award a knighthood to Prince Philip (right) Luke Simpkins, pictured, has moved a motion for a secret ballot  to declare the party leadership open . Now Luke Simpkins, a Liberal MP, has moved a motion for a secret ballot on Tuesday to declare the party leadership open. If it receives the support of a majority of the 102 Liberal MPs it will lead to a leadership vote. Mr Simpkins said in his email to party colleagues that the knighthood for Prince Philip was ‘the final proof of a disconnection with the people’. He wrote: ‘I think we must bring this to a head and test the support of the leadership in the party room.’ Mr Abbott has come out fighting and declared he has the support of Julie Bishop, his deputy and potential candidate to replace him. Communication minister Malcolm Turnbull has also been touted as potential replacements for Mr Abbott. While both have made public statements of support for him, they can sound out supporters from within government ranks now that the ballot is officially on the meeting agenda. Mr Abbott has warned his colleagues against such a challenge. He said Australians voted out the chaotic and divided centre-left Labour Party government in 2013 because it had changed its prime minister twice in four years.","Mr Abbott was ridiculed for decision to award knighthood to Prince Philip .

"Spending on contactless cards more than trebled last year to a record £2.32billion, figures show. Users made ten contactless payments every second in 2014 as they entered mainstream use. It means they were used a total of 319.2million times, the UK Cards Association reports. The steep rise has prompted the spending limit on the cards to be increased to £30 from September this year. On the rise: Users made ten contactless payments every second in 2014 as they entered mainstream use. It means they were used a total of 319.2million times, the UK Cards Association reports (file picture) At the moment shoppers can pay for items worth up to £20 simply by touching it against a reader, rather than entering their PIN or signing anything. There are now 58million contactless cards in circulation in the UK and they are accepted by many major chains and organisations including Aldi, Boots, Waitrose and even Barnardo's. Transport for London launched contactless payments across the transport network in the capital last September. Shashi Verma, Transport for London's director of customer experience, said: 'We have seen over 41 million journeys made across London using contactless within just five months. 'Using contactless payments to travel can save our customers time, they don't need to stop to top-up an Oyster card, or buy a ticket.' People using contactless spend £8.26 per transaction, on average. Separate figures revealed that Bristol has seen the most significant increase in contactless usage in 2014, when compared with the country's other major cities. Widespread: There are now 58million contactless cards in circulation in the UK and they are accepted by many major chains and organisations. It is also in use across the London transport network (pictured) Barclaycard said that contactless payments in Bristol saw 150 per cent growth between January 1 and December 31 last year. London saw the second biggest upswing in contactless transactions, recording a 130 per cent increase over the same period. London leads the way when it comes to overall contactless use, according to Barclaycard's figures. Nearly one in three card transactions taking place last year in London were contactless, according to Barclaycard's data. London was closely followed by Leeds, where the proportion of transactions on cards which were contactless was 27.3 per cent. Richard Koch, head of policy at the UK Cards Association, which is the trade body for the card payments industry, said: 'Contactless has now firmly stepped into the mainstream. 'With usage soaring every month last year, we've seen people flocking to contactless payments as they switch away from cash. 'For retailers, contactless means quicker queues at the tills and greater convenience for their customers.'","Users made 10 contactless payments every second in 2014, figures reveal .

"Chamonix might have Mont Blanc and St Moritz its historic Cresta Run. But the coolest cold spot this week — making front-page news and dominating the chat on snowy websites and glacial blogspots — has been a hitherto unknown resort where I happen to be skiing right now. To the ranks of Verbier, Val d’Isère, Vail and all those other celebrity perches on the world’s more fashionable mountains can now be added another name: Mam Tor in, er, Derbyshire. It has a certain rugged simplicity — the nearest thing to après-ski is a pint in the local village of Edale (and the nearest nightclub is in downtown Macclesfield) — but it is as beautiful as any Alp. Peak performance: Robert Hardman tackles Mam Tor, Derbyshire - just half an hour's drive from Manchester . There are no queues for the ski lifts and it’s all extremely peaceful; no piped music, shrieking Sloanes or bossy instructors shouting ‘bend ze knees’. Apart from the odd walker there isn’t a soul around. Most remarkable of all, however, is the prospect of serious downhill skiing just half an hour’s drive from Manchester. There is nothing unusual about snow in northern England at this time of year, of course. But the current cold snap has delivered an exceptionally generous dump of snow on Mam Tor, a craggy old Bronze Age hill fort in the heart of the Peak District. At 1,700 ft above sea level, it is little more than a mound by Scottish standards and a mere pimple in the Alpine scheme of things. But it is famous for its panoramic views and for the unstable shale which frequently comes cascading down a fearsome gully on its southern side, so much so that the road which used to run beneath it eventually had to be abandoned. This week, an intrepid band of local mountaineers noticed that the gully was covered in more snow than anyone could remember. So they decided to ski it. The dramatic photograph of John Roberts, 30, bombing down the sort of ‘black’ run that would do credit to the Matterhorn — while photographer Alex Messenger climbed up the gully with ice axes — was the shot of a lifetime. ‘I’ll never take another picture like that again. Not in the Peak District, that’s for sure,’ admits Alex, a communications manager with the British Mountaineering Council. Suddenly, seasoned skiers and thrill-seekers were asking: where is this Mam Tor place? And when can I give it a go? What passes for a crowd is expected this weekend. So, with another sunny day and sub-zero temperatures in prospect, I have come to ski the Eiger of Edale with John as my guide. And I soon find a few challenges that wouldn’t trouble the average skier in, say, Davos. In the absence of a chairlift, it’s a half-hour trek up the hill from the National Trust car park. And parts of the path are sheet ice. That’s tricky enough if you are an experienced hill walker. If you are also carrying skis, boots and poles — and they don’t do Sherpas in Derbyshire — it’s rather harder. Finally, we get to the top and John takes me over to the gully. It’s not so much a slope as a stomach-dropping void. There is a near-vertical plunge down a thin strip of snow between the rocks towards the old road below. An overnight avalanche has exposed a lot of fresh boulders in the gully and any attempt to replicate this week’s famous photograph in these conditions would be suicidal. Wigan-born John is no madman. A science graduate whose plans for a career in the Royal Marines were scuppered by a climbing injury, he went into teaching, became an assistant head at the age of 24 and has now set up a legal support service for the teaching profession. He has climbed and skied all over the Alps and scaled the highest peak in Iran. He even built a climbing wall at his Manchester home and says the Peak District has some of the best climbing anywhere. But before now he has never made the same claim about its skiing. ‘Most of my friends have a pair of what we call “Peak skis” — old ones that you don’t mind bashing a bit,’ he says. ‘Every other winter, you might get enough snow for a bit of fun up here. But I can’t remember anything as good as this.’ Daring: John Roberts' dramatic descent, pictured, made headlines after it was photographed this week . We set off down a less treacherous slope in the direction of Castleton. It might not be up to Ski Sunday standards but it’s a lot better than the conditions I found in several resorts while driving through the French Alps shortly before Christmas. Then, the pistes in places like Morzine and chi-chi Megève — at more than twice the altitude of Mam Tor — were little more than grass and mud (they have enjoyed plenty of snow since then). They would have been thrilled to have snow like this at the start of their season. Whizzing down another aspect of Mam Tor, past a rather startled rambler enjoying a contemplative sarnie, I come across another obstacle that does not trouble the average punter in Klosters or Courchevel — a stile. But then this landscape is, arguably, prettier than any of those famous ski destinations. That is because every ski resort is covered in pylons, stations and cables. Mam Tor has nothing more intrusive than a dry stone wall. I daresay Méribel, St Anton and even the dear old Cairngorms can probably sleep easy, safe in the knowledge that this latest addition to the ski map of Europe is not going to last. But for one more day or two, at least, let us raise a glass of Glühwein to the Manchester Matterhorn.","The coolest ski resort this week is the rugged Mam Tor in Derbyshire .

"The Prime Minister and his deputy Julie Bishop have appeared in public together for the first time since news of a leadership spill emerged, with Mr Abbott declaring the motion will fail. He said he will take that as a an endorsement of his leadership, and also claimed the coalition was elected to end the 'Game of Thrones' circus of chaos and disunity during Labor's years in government. 'The last thing anyone wants is to see a government in this country turn into some kind of Game of Thrones,' he said in Townsville. 'Despite some distractions, I am just getting on with government.' Scroll down for video . On Saturday morning Prime Minister Tony Abbott and deputy Julie Bishop appeared as a united front in Queesland . Mr Abbott said the two backbenchers who foreshadowed the spill motion were entitled to take that action . He also revealed he believes the spill will fail and if so he will take that as an endorsement of his leadership . Mr Abbott said the two Liberal backbenchers who foreshadowed the spill motion were entitled to take that action and it would be dealt with in the party room on Tuesday in a secret ballot. 'Should this spill motion be defeated, as I expect, I will be taking that as a strong endorsement of the existing leadership team, as a vote of confidence in the existing leadership team,' he said. Mr Abbott said it wasn't about him. 'It's never been about me, it's always been as far as I am concerned about delivering good government,' he said. Flanked by deputy leader Julie Bishop, who offered her unqualified support, and Nationals leader Warren Truss, Mr Abbott said the people of Australia expected them to get on with the job of government not engage in navel gazing. Ms Bishop said as Mr Abbott's deputy, she supported the prime minister. 'I was elected the deputy of this party in 2007 and again in 2013. I understand from my colleagues that they look to me for stability and certainty,' she said. Ms Bishop said as Mr Abbott's deputy, she supported the prime minister . This public appearance comes after much speculation that Ms Bishop did not support Mr Abbott and would not stand on a ticket with him . The pair were in North Queensland to announce the government will provide the necessary immigration, customs and quarantine facilities to allow Townsville airport to begin receiving and dispatching international flights from March 1 . This latest public appearance comes off the back of weeks of turmoil in the Liberal party. On Friday, Liberal backbencher Luke Simpkins, a little-known West Australian MP, announced he had moved a motion to topple the Prime Minister in an email to his Liberal colleagues. In a fiery address, a clearly angered Mr Abbott said on the same day: 'We are not the Labor Party. We are not going to repeat the chaos and instability of the Labor years. 'I have spoken to deputy leader Julie Bishop and we will stand together to urge the party room to defeat this particular motion.' But Ms Bishop, who did not appear with Mr Abbott, would only issue a short and very qualified statement of support. 'I agreed with the Prime Minister that due to cabinet solidarity and my position as Deputy Leader there should be support for current leadership in spill motion,' she said. The prime minister was speaking in Townsville to announce plans for the city's airport . Luke Simpkins, pictured with potential leadership contender Malcolm Turnbull, has announced he will move for a federal Liberal leadership spill . Ms Bishop's support could be pivotal to the Liberal leadership. Scott Morrison has ruled himself out of the top job but Malcolm Turnbull has not. Mr Abbott said the MPs who called for the spill - Mr Simpkins and fellow backbencher Don Randall - were perfectly entitled to call for a challenge. However, he said: 'They are asking the Party Room to vote out the people that the electorate voted in in September 2013.' He said that the knighthood of Prince Philip, issued by Mr Abbott on Australia Day, was the final straw for him. In his email to his Liberal colleagues he wrote: 'The knighthood issue was for many the final proof of a disconnection with the people,' Simpkins wrote in the email. 'I think that we must bring this to a head, and test the support of the leadership in the party room. 'I have therefore submitted to the Chief Government Whip a motion to spill the leadership positions of the Federal Parliamentary Liberal party.' Chief Government Whip Phillip Ruddock said the matter had been listed for discussion for the Tuesday party room meeting. Text: This is the full email Luke Simpkins sent to all of his parliamentary colleagues . Prime Minister Tony Abbott will reportedly face a leadership challenge on Tuesday in Canberra . Meanwhile, Tasmanian Liberal MP Andrew Nikolic has branded the move to challenge Mr Tony Abbott as disappointing and divisive. In an email to backbench colleague Mr Simpkins,  Mr Nikolic dismissed the move as the 'ill-disciplined and self-interested behaviours that the Australian people explicitly rejected in 2013'. The email was copied to other coalition MPs and senators. The note reportedly reads: 'Luke, Your actions are disappointing and divisive. 'In my view you are repeating the ill-disciplined and self-interested behaviours that the Australian people explicitly rejected in 2013. 'You do not have my support for this. 'I will be arguing strongly against your motion and in support of what I believe is a clear majority of colleagues and constituents who prefer stability and unity of purpose.' It's the first Liberal leadership challenge since 2009. After the internal fallout from the-then Liberal Party and Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull's support for the Rudd Government's ETS plan in 2009 (which split the Coalition because of the National Party's opposition to it) there was a three-way spill, involving Mr Turnbull, Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey. In the end, Abbott claimed the leadership by one vote over Turnbull, 42 votes to 41. No one has put up their hand to contest Mr Abbott, but Mr Turnbull would not rule out a challenge on Thursday evening. Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull was reportedly left 'underwhelmed' after a meeting with the PM .","Tony Abbott had fronted reporters in Queensland saying the spill will fail .

"A notorious Saudi cleric preached at a mosque accused of  radicalising three young Britons fighting in Syria. Mohammed al-Arifi, who has called for holy war to overthrow Bashar al-Assad’s regime, spoke at Cardiff’s Al Manar centre. The trio – two brothers and a friend – attended the mosque before leaving their homes to join the civil war. Scroll down for video . Mohammed al-Arifi, who has called for holy war to overthrow Bashar al-Assad's regime, spoke at Cardiff's Al Manar centre . Although banned from entering Switzerland because of his extremist views, al-Arifi has visited the UK several times. A Sunni Muslim, he has been accused of stirring up tensions with the rival Shia sect, reportedly calling it evil and accusing adherents of kidnapping, cooking and skinning children. In other developments in the  terror crisis: . Cardiff school friends Nasser Muthana, and Reyaad Khan, both 20, last week appeared in the recruitment video for ISIS with a friend. Khan, who once dreamed of becoming Britain’s first Asian prime minister, was a successful student before he was radicalised. Muthana, who gave up four offers of places at medical school to become a jihadist, later persuaded his younger brother Aseel, 17, to join him in Syria. Although banned from entering Switzerland because of his extremist views, al-Arifi has visited the UK several times . Their father, Yemen-born Ahmed Muthana, 57, says his sons were ‘brainwashed’ after they began attending Al Manar. He said none of the elders at the mosque were dangerous but visiting clerics may have put ideas in the heads of his boys. A source close to the Yemeni community in Cardiff said: ‘These boys were groomed (at Al Manar) – obviously not to the stage to go, but so that they are satisfied that what they go to do is right. It all comes from the same school of thought. Fight the Shias, fight these people, fight those – that’s where it started. ‘The teaching [at Al Manar] helped the people recruiting. If someone tried to recruit me, I wouldn’t go unless I’m convinced. But once they’re groomed, all it takes is someone to say come and I’ll take you.’ It is understood that children in Cardiff’s Muslim community have been receiving messages from Nasser Muthana in Syria via the mobile phone messaging service WhatsApp. Nasser Muthana (left), 20, is one of the Britons . who have been radicalised. Right, Aseel Muthana, his 17-year-old . younger brother. Their father has begged them to come home . The source said he believed more young boys from the area who had studied at Al Manar may also join the fight. ‘There’s a few boys who I wouldn’t be shocked if they went. The authorities should be doing something about it,’ he said. Several families in the Yemeni community are understood to have banned their children from attending teachings or prayer at the mosque. Schoolboy to jihadist: Reyaad Khan, now 20, is pictured at school with friends in Cardiff in 2010. He has now travelled to the Middle East to fight alongside Islamist militants . Recruitment video: Reyaad Khan, Nasser Muthana and another Briton in Syria . A 20-year-old, who knew the Muthana . brothers for many years, said the Al Manar Centre had a good reputation. But he added that he had heard they ‘brought one or two radical . preachers in to talk on the sly’. Al-Arifi spoke at the mosque in June 2012. A video and photograph posted online show excited worshippers flocking around him. Mosque trustee Barak Albayaty said the internet was being used to brainwash young Muslim men to take up arms with ISIS. He . said: ‘Nasser Muthana was just like any other guy – I was shocked to . see him in the video. But I am sure [this mosque] is not the source of . radicalism. We’re against going to Syria for the armed struggle and have . spelled this out on many occasions. ‘The boys are affected by the internet. It’s not just Cardiff, it’s all over the UK. I’m told the numbers could be in the hundreds all over the UK.’ Call to arms by Saudi radical . Elders at the mosque are due to meet this week to discuss the issue. Mr Muthana is due to make a formal statement to South Wales Police today confirming his son is the young man in the ISIS recruitment video. He said: ‘I know I may never see my two sons again and I am prepared for that. But my wife is sick at the thought. My sons have betrayed their family and betrayed their country, which is Britain.’ Khan’s mother yesterday made a tearful appeal to her only son to come home. ‘It’s absolutely devastating. We can’t sleep or eat, we’re very ill,’ she told Sky News. ‘Reyaad, please come back home. I’m dying for you. You are my only son. Please come back Reyaad. It’s not good what you are doing.’ Among the new wave of British jihadists are two former sixth-formers from Coventry – like Cardiff, a city not previously linked to Islamic extremists. Eighteen-year-old Mohammed Hadi is the youngest Briton fighting with ISIS to be identified so far. The oldest of five children, he had been dubbed Osama bin Bieber by friends on social media because of his childish looks. A former classmate yesterday said Hadi was ‘brainwashed’  at a madrassa and mosque where he studied Arabic and the Koran. Hadi is understood to have travelled to Syria with at least three youths from the madrassa. His father, Mahir, 38, a factory worker, refused to comment.","Mohammed al-Arifi has called for holy war to overthrow Assad’s regime .

"A row has broken out in court over a ‘secret’ decision to appoint a new judge to preside over the retrial of four current and former Sun journalists accused of bribing public officials for information. Judge Richard Marks QC, who oversaw the first trial of the men, was expected to officiate when the case is reheard later this year. But at an Old Bailey hearing yesterday, it emerged that he had been mysteriously substituted by Judge Charles Wide. It was claimed that more senior judges had intervened to put Judge Wide in charge. Judge Wide is the only judge so far to have presided in a case which has seen a conviction of a journalist in relation to allegations of unlawful payments to public officials for stories. In an email to barristers on Wednesday, Judge Marks revealed that he had been taken off the case. He said: ‘It has been decided (not by me but by my elders and betters) that I am not going to be doing the retrial.’ Substitute: Judge Richard Marks QC, who oversaw the first trial of the men, was expected to officiate when the case is reheard later this year. But at an Old Bailey hearing yesterday, it emerged he had been mysteriously replaced by Judge Charles Wide . At yesterday’s hearing, a senior defence lawyer demanded an explanation for the move and suggested that it would appear as if ‘something has been going on behind the scenes’. Nigel Rumfitt, QC, representing Sun head of news Chris Pharo, said: ‘It cannot be a state secret. It is this sort of obsessive childish secrecy we get in this country which causes intense disquiet. ‘It was on February 4 we received an email, part of which I have quoted, that caused very considerable consternation, which very much gives the impression that His Honour Judge Marks has been taken off this against his will. ‘This deserves an explanation. The way this comes about gives rise to the impression that something has been going on behind the scenes which should have been dealt with transparently.’ Richard Kovalvesky, QC, for Sun reporter Jamie Pyatt, described the move to replace Judge Marks as ‘an extraordinary decision’. He said he knew that ‘there is a significant variance’ between the judges on the issue of ‘mens rea’, a common law test of criminal liability. In reply, Judge Wide said: ‘Are you suggesting that a judge can’t change their mind after hearing fresh submissions?’ The court heard that the prosecution in the case had no objection to the change of trial judge and that there was no suggestion of unfairness. Oliver Glasgow, for the prosecution, said he could not see an issue with ‘one fair judge replaced by another’. Mr Pharo, Mr Pyatt, former deputy news editor Ben O’Driscoll and ex-managing editor Graham Dudman face a retrial at the Old Bailey on September 21 after a jury last month failed to reach verdicts on some charges of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office. They deny the allegations. Mr O’Driscoll and Mr Dudman were cleared on some charges of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office at the trial at Kingston Crown Court. The Sun’s picture editor, John Edwards, and former reporter John Troup were cleared of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office.

"Nicky Morgan claims teachers are ‘working far too hard, for far too long’ and has promised to slash their workload.

Nicky Morgan, pictured here with David Cameron, wants to help lighten the burden on teachers, issuing a joint statement with Nick Clegg in the Times Educational Supplement . Her conciliatory approach will be seen as another attempt to distance herself from predecessor, Michael Gove, who confronted the Left-wing educational establishment. She has earned the nickname of Ms U-Turn after a series of departures from Mr Gove’s policies. In a joint article published in the Times Educational Supplement, Mrs Morgan and Mr Clegg said: ‘The commitment, dedication and sheer hard work of teachers up and down the country is inspirational. But far too many are working far too hard, for far too long – and it’s simply not sustainable.’ In contrast Mr Gove told teachers in September 2013 as they prepared to strike that they’d never had it so good.

"A heartbreaking, deathbed video of a boy who suffered 99 per cent burns was shown in court on Thursday where he named the teenager who raped him and then set him alight in an attempt to cover up his crime. Robbie Middleton's frail voice named suspect Donald Collins as his rapist and torturer, just shortly before he passed away, aged 21, in 2011. Robbie succumbed to cancer, believed to have been caused by the horrific burn injuries he suffered 13 years before. A medical examiner ruled his death a homicide. In 1998, Robbie was tied to a tree and set alight on his 8th birthday in woodland behind his home in Splendora, Texas. Scroll down for video . Robert Middleton (pictured left and right) suffered burns across 99 percent of his body and endured years of physical therapy before he died in 2011 from skin cancer. He named his alleged attacker and rapist on video tape shortly before his death . Collins, 29, is on trial for capital murder over Robbie's death but will not face the death penalty because he was 13 years old when the attack happened. He faces a maximum sentence of 40 years in jail. At trial on Thursday, the jury was shown a 30-minute video of Robbie just 17 days before he died. According to the Houston Chronicle, on the tape Robbie said: 'Don grabbed me, turned me around and threw gas in my face.' He said that he was blinded by the gasoline but when he realized he was on fire, he started to run from the woodland trail back home. He added: 'I was running as fast as I could but I couldn't see where I was running to', recalling that he was screaming and in horrific pain. The 21-year-old Robbie was then asked by the interviewer, attorney Craig Sico, if he was sexually assaulted by Collins. Robbie replied that two weeks before he was burned, Collins 'took me out into the woods where I was burned. He pulled my clothes down and started raping me'. The prosecution has alleged that Collins set eight-year-old Robbie on fire to prevent his crime being discovered. While the jury watched the video, the defendant turned his back to the screen and seemed to read a newspaper, the Chronicle reported. Collins has pleaded not guilty. Defendant Don Collins, 29, (pictured in court at trial) allegedly tied eight-year-old Robert Middleton  to a tree, doused him with gasoline, and set him on fire in 1998. Collins was 13 years old at the time . Robbie Middleton eventually died from skin cancer in 2011, thought to have been caused by the severe burns he suffered 13 years before . His defense lawyer has claimed that Robbie, who spent most of his life at Shriner's Children's Hospital in Galveston, named Collins along with many others soon after the attack. Attorney E. Tay Bond said there was not enough evidence to convict Collins and accused the Middleton family's attorney of making up the rape theory. Robbie's mother Colleen Middleton choked back tears as she told the jury on Wednesday about how Robbie told her Don Collins, 13, had tied him up and set him on fire . The defense team added that there were no witnesses to the attack and claimed prosecutors were playing to the jury's emotions. 'Do not expect the defense to bring an eyewitness to this tragedy because there is not one,' Bond told jurors. 'There are no witnesses from the woods except for Robbie.' However prosecutors countered that witnesses will testify that Collins admitted to them that he poured gasoline on Robbie. 'Our case is based on the testimony of adults who have come forward and can tell you what this man did when they were children,' Montgomery County prosecutor Kelly Blackburn said in his opening statement. Collins was convicted of raping another eight-year-old boy in 2001 at gunpoint. From the age of 16, he spent four years in a juvenile detention center for the crime. The victim testified at a 2013 hearing to determine whether Collins should be tried as an adult for the crime against Robbie Middleton. The victim said that Collins threatened to burn him if he told anyone about the assault. A judge determined last March that Collins could be tried for murder as an adult, despite being a teenager at the time. In 1998, Robbie had named Collins as his attacker and the 13-year-old was arrested. Collins spent several months in juvenile detention but was released after prosecutors said they didn't have enough evidence to pursue the case . On Wednesday, Robbie's mother Colleen Middleton choked back tears as she told the Houston court how Collins had 'stalked' her son in the days before the attack. She testified that Robbie told her Don Collins, 13, had tied him up and set him on fire. Mrs Middleton, who found her badly-burned son collapsed by her home, said that in the months after the attack he was so delirious with pain that he named everyone he knew as his attacker - including the family dog. However, after almost a year, and when he began to regain lucidity, he named Don Collins as his attacker - and never wavered. Mrs Middleton said it had been a 'long road' for the family and they were unclear if Robbie would ever get justice for the horrific injuries he had suffered. She said: 'When Robert died, we were thinking maybe nothing will ever happen. Maybe someone is just going to get away with what they did to him.' However prosecutors countered that witnesses will testify that Collins admitted to them that he poured gasoline on Robbie as the boy walked through woods near his home. It was determined last year that Collins, now 29, could be tried as an adult in the murder trial even though he was 13 years old (pictured) when he allegedly raped and set eight-year-old Robbie Middleton on f .","Robbie Middleton's frail voice named suspect Donald Collins as his rapist and torturer, just shortly before he died aged 21 in 2011 .

"At $60 million (£39 million) to send a satellite to orbit, one of the biggest challenges facing space exploration is cost. But the US military believes it has a solution; Use fighter jets instead of rockets to get satellites and probes off the ground. It says this will bring cost of launch down to just $1 million (£650,000), while cutting launch times from a few months to just a few hours. Scroll down for video . The US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) is working on a new way to launch low-orbit satellites, uses US fighter jets instead of expensive rockets . The US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) has now released created a concept video of how the process would work. It shows how the fighter jet will begin a vertical ascension, holding onto the mini-rocket in what has been named the Airborne Launch Assist Space Access (Alasa) program. Once it hits a certain height, the mini-rocket disconnects from the fighter jet, and begins to push to low-orbit with its payload. In the video, the first stage ignites, and eventual separates. The second stage then ignites and the payload fairing falls away burning up in Earth's atmosphere. The Airborne Launch Assist Space Access program will see rockets strapped to fighter jets on runways . The video shows how the fighter jet will begin a vertical ascension, holding onto the mini-rocket and payload . After taking off from the runway, the fighter jet will begin a vertical ascension, holding onto the mini-rocket. Once it hits a certain height, the mini-rocket disconnects from the fighter jet, and begins to push to low-orbit with its payload. The first stage ignites, and eventual separates. The second stage then ignites and the payload fairing falls away burning up in Earth's atmosphere. The second stage then continues on its journey to low-earth orbit where, once it gets into position, the payload deploys. The second stage then continues on its journey to low-earth orbit where, once it gets into position, the payload deploys. 'We've made good progress so far toward Alasa's ambitious goal of propelling 100-pound satellites into low Earth orbit within 24 hours of call-up, all for less than $1 million per launch,' said Bradford Tousley, director of Darpa's Tactical Technology Office. 'We're moving ahead with rigorous testing of new technologies that we hope one day could enable revolutionary satellite launch systems that provide more affordable, routine and reliable access to space.' Darpa is currently favouring the use of F-15 planes that do not require modifications to carry out launches. Launches of satellites by governments requires scheduling years in advance for the few available slots at the nation's limited number of launch locations. In the animation, the rocket disconnects from the fighter jet, and begins to push to low-orbit with its payload .

Second stage ignites and the fairing falls away (artist's impression pictured)  burning up in Earth's atmosphere . This slow, expensive process is causing a bottleneck in placing essential space assets in orbit. The current Alasa design envisions launching a low-cost, expendable launch vehicle from conventional aircraft. Serving as a reusable first stage, the plane would fly to high altitude and release the launch vehicle, which would carry the payload to the desired location. 'Alasa seeks to overcome the limitations of current launch systems by streamlining design and manufacturing and leveraging the flexibility and re-usability of an air-launched system,' said Mitchell Burnside Clapp, program manager. 'We envision an alternative to ride-sharing for satellites that enables satellite owners to launch payloads from any location into orbits of their choosing, on schedules of their choosing, on a launch vehicle designed specifically for small payloads.' This artist's concept shows the payload fairing falling away. The current Alasa design envisions launching a low-cost, expendable launch vehicle from conventional aircraft. Darpa says it is currently favouring the F-15 . Perhaps the most daring technology Alasa is attempted to create is a new high-energy monopropellant, which aims to combine fuel and oxidiser into a single liquid . Darpa is now working on designing commercial-grade avionics and composite structures. Perhaps the most daring technology Alasa is attempted to create is a new high-energy monopropellant, which aims to combine fuel and oxidiser into a single liquid. If successful, the monopropellant would allow simpler designs and reduced manufacturing and operation costs. Alasa also aims to reduce infrastructure costs by using runways instead of fixed vertical launch sites, automating operations and avoiding unnecessary services. 'Small satellites in the Alasa payload class represent the fastest-growing segment of the space launch market,' Burnside Clapp said. 'Darpa expects this growth trend to continue as small satellites become increasingly more capable.' Current plans call for the first Alasa launch late this year, with a total of 12 Alasa launches planned through mid-2016.

"Another winter storm is set to strike the Northeast, pummeling the already-frozen landscape with as much as ten inches of snow in a four-day onslaught. Less than a week after parts of the region received unprecedented levels of snowfall, a new system is set to roll down across the Midwest from the Canadian border. The storm, dubbed Marcus, is due to start with light snow Saturday, but will intensify and continue through to Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Coming in: Forecasters say almost another foot of snow could blanket the Northeast during a four-day storm . Starting out: An initial storm over the weekend, the track of which will move from west to east as seen above, will be reinforced by a second at the start of next week . Freezer: The above map from the National Weather Service shows the likelihood of temperatures being below average over the week week. Deeper blue means a higher chance of a large difference. The West Coast will be warmer than usual in the same period . Winter weather will carve a path stretching from New York City in the south into the upper reaches of Vermont and New Hampshire to the north, according to forecasts by Accuweather. Massachusetts, and Boston in particular, will be at the epicenter of the snowstorm, and could be due another 11 inches of snow. The region is still digging its way out from under a 40-inch dump that has come in the past two weeks, setting new snowfall records in the state's capital. Most of Massachusetts was already on a winter storm alert Friday night. The snowfall is set to be accompanied by bitter cold, with the National Weather Service predicting temperatures far below average for stretching from Philadelphia to southern Maine.

The initial storm, which is due to drop several inches of snow over the weekend, will be followed immediately by a new cold weather system which will bring yet more snow. However, the outer reaches of the 'snow corridor' straddling New England will be less badly affected, with as little as three inches of snow forecast over New York City. According to The Weather Channel, the dip in temperatures will be due to disturbances in the jet stream pushing the boundaries of cold and warm air past the Canadian border into the U.S. The outlet also said that, while there could be significant snowfall across the four days, the disruption will be less than in a short, intense storm because snow plows will have more time to clear it up.","Boston, already hit by 40-inch downfall, due another 11 by next week .

"A judge has set a trial date for a man charged in the case of the 'Grim Sleeper' serial killings that spanned two decades in Los Angeles. Lonnie Franklin Jr., who has pleaded not guilty to ten counts of murder and one count of attempted murder, will stand trial on June 29, it was announced today. Jury selection will begin the following day, according to Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy. During the court hearing today, frustrated families urged the judge to move the case forward after years of delays, and cited Marsy's Law - a voter approved bill of rights that allows families of victims the right to a speedy trial. A judge has set a trial date for Lonnie Franklin Jr. (above at the court hearing today), the man charged with ten counts of murder in the 'Grim Sleeper' serial killings that spanned two decades in Los Angeles . Franklin, 62, has pleaded not guilty to ten counts of murder and one count of attempted murder . He could face the death penalty if convicted of the killings that occurred between 1985 and 2007 (above photographs found in his possession) Franklin, 62, could face the death penalty if convicted of the killings that occurred between 1985 and 2007. The nickname 'Grim Sleeper' was coined because of the gap between slayings in 1988 and 2002. Police arrested Franklin in July 2010 after his DNA was connected to more than a dozen crime scenes. They had linked the crimes, but did not have a suspect until a crime lab computer traced the sample to one of Franklin's family members. An officer posing as a busboy at a pizza parlor got DNA samples from dishes and utensils Franklin had been eating with at a birthday party. Franklin's trial date is set to begin on June 29 and jury selection will begin the following day, according to Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy (above Franklin and his attorney Louisa Pensanti during the court hearing) Relatives of victims (family members of victim Alicia Monique Alexander: Sherry Alexander, right, and husband Darin Alexander, left, pictured in 2010) urged the Los Angeles Superior Court judge to set a trial date citing Marsy's Law, a voter-approved victim's bill of right allowing family members of the victims to testify . Attorney Salarno Ashford has successfully argued three times to have trial dates set so the victims could have their day in court (above officers remove items from Franklin's home after he was arrested in 2010 by a SWAT team in LA) As news of the trial date has been announced, attorney Nina Salarno Ashford, a board member of Crime Victims United, said it is not unusual for capital cases to take years to complete. However Marsy's Law, which was passed in 2008 and cited by prosecutors during the court hearing, gives victims some leverage in speeding things up though it is still not widely used, she said. August 10, 1985: Debra Jackson - A 29-year-old cocktail waitress who went to take a bus home after visiting her friend's house. Her body was found three days later with three gunshot wounds to the chest. August 12, 1986: Henrietta Wright - The 35-year-old was found dead in an alley near West Vernon Avenue. She was shot twice and wrapped in a blanket and covered in a mattress. August 14, 1986: Thomas Steele - The only known male victim of the serial killer. The 36-year-old was found with a single gunshot wound to the head in the middle of a street intersection. January 10, 1987: Barbara Ware - The 23-year-old had been shot once in the chest and her body had been dumped under a pile of rubbish. April 15, 1987: Bernita Sparks - 26-year-old went out to the shops but never returned. Her body was found in a bin, covered in rubbish. She had been shot, strangled and beaten. October 31, 1987: Mary Lowe - 26-year-old left home to go to a party, but never returned. Her body was found in an alley of Western Avenue. January 30, 1988: Lachrica Jefferson - Officers found the 22-year-old's body with a napkin over the face with the word 'AIDS' written on it. September 11, 1988: Alicia Alexander - Another victim killed while going to the shops. The 18-year-old's body was also found in an alley near Western Avenue. December 21, 2001: Princess Berthomieux - The end of the 14-year hiatus. DNA on the 14-year-old's body matched those of previous killings. July 11, 2003: Valerie McCorvey - 35-year-old had been strangled and sexually assaulted. January 1, 2007: Janecia Peters - 25-year-old was shot in the back and her body was dumped in a rubbish bag. Marsy's Law, guaranteed for defendants, can be extended to family members of victims. It also allows victims to address the court, and Porter Alexander, who spent more than 20 years wondering if his daughter's killer would ever be caught, was among those who addressed the court. Attorney Salarno Ashford has used the law to represent victims throughout the process, including cross-examining witnesses at trial. She has also successfully argued three times to have trial dates set so the victims could have their day in court. 'It's always been a fault in our system that defendants were able to play a shell game and delay things,' she said. Deputy District Attorney Beth Silverman said the case has been plagued by delays with no end in sight and that the judge has failed to hold the defense to strict deadlines to complete their investigation. However, defense lawyer Seymour Amster blamed the prosecution, and said his expert found DNA from another man at three of the crime scenes and is seeking to test more material because the evidence could help his client. Amster said the prosecution has opposed releasing the items for testing and have asked for more time to prepare their response. 'There are rumors that I'm trying to delay this thing,' he said. 'I'm really not. I'm a strong proponent of do it once, do it right.' Silverman said that she recognizes the need to balance Franklin's right to prepare for trial, but that the court must balance that with the rights of the victims and the community. She said those rights have already been compromised. A firearms expert who tested guns retired last year, so the testing needed to be done again. Medical examiners and a supervising criminalist at the coroner's office have retired and will need to be replaced. And the mother of victim Mary Lowe died more than two years ago, depriving her of the chance Alexander and other victims' families will have to address the court. 'It's a waiting game,' said Alexander, whose 18-year-old daughter, Monique, was killed in 1988. 'I need to keep up my strength. I hope I'm here for the ending.'","Lonnie Franklin Jr., 62, is charged with ten counts of murder in killings that spanned from 1985 to 2007 in Los Angeles, California .

The idea to start doing videos on MyFreeCams, which features women doing live webcam shows in which they can make money as viewers tip them with virtual tokens they buy from the site, came after Sundelrand could not find a waitressing job near campus. She did her first webcam video in October, and in an hour had made $150 - and earned plenty of compliments. 'Working a minimum wage job, there’s people that are just mean to you when they’re having a crappy day,' she told the Daily News. 'On MyFreeCams, [users] had nothing but nice things to say. And I made way more than I would working any other job.' She started making videos regularly at her home while her roommates were out, including one in which she had sex with a former boyfriend, and then, at the suggestion of one of the site's users, decided to take her show to a public place. That is when she made the library video, which earned her $700 for about an hour, and within a few weeks she had made the decision to drop out of college and focus on making videos for the site. The young woman's parents are 'upset' she says about the video, that saw her touching herself and flashing the camera as unaware students walked around behind her . Then, in January, she was sitting in her room when she began getting a barrage of friend requests from 'frat boys,' and then, after checking the gossip app YikYak, learned that everyone was talking about the 'library girl.' Her mother also began receiving messages around that time as well, as concerned friends started asking about her daughter, and while there was some relief Sunderland explains when her mother learned she had just filmed a video and had not been hurt, the mother still told her daughter; 'This is just something you can learn a lesson from and move on.' That is not what Sunderland intends to do however, a decision that has now made her parents 'upset' she reveals, as the offers are not pouring in for the young woman, and she just completed her first professional photo shoot. One thing people will not be seeing Sunderland do anymore however is webcam shows on MyFreeCams - the site has now banned her for violating their guidelines with her library clip. She is also banned from the Oregon State campus and last week was arrested and cited with public indecency before being released. As for how the video made its way to PornHub, Sunderland says she has 'no clue.'","Kendra Sunderland, 19, of Corvallis, Oregon, filmed a webcam video in the Oregon State library in which she was topless and touching herself .

"The controversial prosecution of an NHS doctor over female genital mutilation was justified, a Liberal Democrat minister has claimed. Home Office minister Lynne Featherstone said the 'shock waves' the case created would serve as a warning to others about the dangers associated with treating victims. She was speaking after Dhanuson Dharmasena, 32, was acquitted in less than 25 minutes of carrying out FGM on a young woman at Whittington Hospital in north London in 2012. Lynne Featherstone said it was right to put Dhanuson Dharmasena on trial - even though he was acquitted in less than 25 minutes of carrying out FGM on a young woman at Whittington Hospital in north London in 2012 . He was accused of illegally stitching the woman after she had given birth – re-doing the FGM she had as a six year-old in Somalia. But a jury swiftly found him not guilty after hearing he put in a single stitch to stop her bleeding. Another man, Hasan Mohamed, 41, was also cleared of abetting the offence. Dr Danuson Dharmasena was cleared of carrying out female genital mutilation . The Crown Prosecution Service and the Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, have been forced to defend their actions amid accusations of running a 'show trial' which risked diverting attention from genuine victims of the crime. Doctors and lawyers said the 'insulting' prosecution had also risked making other doctors fearful of treating FGM victims. But yesterday, Miss Featherstone, the Lib Dem MP for Hornsey and Wood Green, in north London, said it was right to put Dr Dharmasena on trial. 'Whatever the outcome of that case, the shock waves sent through the medical profession when the arrest was announced, hopefully will be very significant in making everyone in the frontline think, what am I doing? Do I know about this?' she said. Miss Featherstone, speaking at a Zero Tolerance to FGM Summit in central London yesterday, added: 'I would ask health professionals to remember that is who they are protecting. These girls who have no voice, no choice and no control in their lives.' Keith Vaz MP has warned that the 'unfortunate' handling of the case by the CPS would 'damage the campaign to encourage people to report FGM because there is a feeling that this has been initiated in haste'.

"Labour was last night urged to stop taking unpaid help from an accountancy giant accused by MPs of promoting tax avoidance schemes on an ‘industrial scale’. Senior Labour politicians – including members of Ed Miliband’s frontbench team – have accepted more than £500,000 worth of free help and advice from PricewaterhouseCoopers. Ed Balls, Chuka Umunna and Tristram Hunt are among them. The revelation is particularly damaging because PwC has placed its staff in Labour teams drawing up official policies on economic issues, including tax. Ed Balls (right) was among Ed Miliband's senior frontbench team who has accepted more than £500,000 worth of free help and advice from PricewaterhouseCoopers . Margaret Hodge, the chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee and a senior Labour MP, said the secondment of PwC staff to work in the offices of opposition frontbenchers was ‘inappropriate’. ‘The Conservatives took money from PricewaterhouseCoopers when they were in opposition, the Labour Party does and probably the Liberal Democrats too. I think that’s inappropriate, I wouldn’t do it,’ she told Radio 4’s The World at One. Her comments came after the PAC issued a blistering report condemning the way that PwC devised ‘complex strategies and contrived structures’ to help big companies dramatically reduce their tax bills. In a statement, PwC said that its secondees provided ‘limited and fully disclosed technical support’. Mrs Hodge said that the rules governing such arrangements were too weak and needed to be tightened. Analysis of the Register of Members Interests shows that PwC spent a total of £547,565 seconding their staff to work in the offices of many of Mr Milliband’s frontbench team. A total of 11 Labour MPs have had a member of the company working in their Westminster offices in the last year. Mr Balls, the shadow chancellor, has had two members of staff from the accountancy firm working with him, worth the equivalent of £64,162. Chuka Umunna (left) and Tristram Hunt (right) are also among the MPs said to have listed PwC staff working in their offices. Mr Umunna had research assistants worth £99,500 and Mr Hunt had one at value of £74,655 . On three occasions, Mr Umunna, the shadow business secretary, lists having had PwC research assistants working in his office, a perk worth £99,550. Mr Hunt, the shadow education secretary, also had a research assistant for six months at a value of £74,655. Labour defended the arrangements, saying that PwC had provided long-standing support to all three main political parties on a non-party basis. The firm said: ‘PwC has no political affiliation. We do not develop policy on their behalf.’ Labour defended the arrangements, saying that PwC had provided long-standing support to all three main political parties on a non-party basis .","Senior Labour politicians accepted more than £500,000 worth of free help .

"Tucked away in the Cotswolds, the village of South Cerney provides the perfect getaway for families, pensioners and the odd celebrity looking for a more traditional way of life. Grade II listed cottages and Audi TTs line the high street, where the tight-knit community comes together for cake sales and flower shows. But, according to its furious inhabitants, this way of life could all now be under threat. They are in uproar over plans for a Co-operative store to be opened in the heart of the village – where houses fetch up to £2million – claiming it will hit house prices and ruin the ‘ambience’. Idyllic: The village of South Cerney provides the perfect getaway for families, pensioners and the odd celebrity looking for a more traditional way of life . Residents say the supermarket is not in keeping with the village, which dates from Saxon times, and could have a ‘reverse Waitrose-effect’. The estate agent Savills indicated in 2013 that house prices in ‘Waitrose postcodes’ were 25 per cent higher than the UK average. One house in South Cerney has reportedly already dropped by £70,000 in value – suggesting that, in contrast to a supermarket boosting house prices in the village, the prospect of one is being blamed for bringing them down. Cotswold District Council has already approved plans for a disused building to become a supermarket – despite 144 objections from residents. There is uproar over plans for a Co-operative store to be opened in the heart of the village . Now there have been 168 objections to a new planning application to keep the shop open from 7am to 11pm every day of the week. Objectors have nicknamed it the ‘inconvenience store’. The row comes a week after it emerged that Emma Thompson is backing a campaign against a Tesco being built in Belsize Park, North London. The Oscar-winning actress claimed the feeling of the ‘villagey’ neighbourhood near Hampstead Heath would be destroyed. Many of the 3,500 residents in South Cerney are fiercely proud of their village – founded in AD999 by Saxon settlers with a charter from King Aethelred II. The river Churn flows past two pubs, while nearby is a 13th-century manor house, part of which TV personality Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen is renting. Residents said the few local amenities – which include a post office, a fish and chip shop, a pharmacy, and a small Spar convenience store – were all they needed. For the weekly grocery shop, many said they were happy to drive less than five miles to the large 24-hour Tesco Extra in Cirencester. Mother of two Sarah Forbes, 40, said the supermarket would be ‘hideous’ and ‘completely out of keeping’ among the ‘quintessentially English cottages’. Michael and Christina Pollard, both 69, have lived in the village for 32 years but felt ‘forced’ to put their four-bedroom house up for sale because of the plans. Backing: Emma Thompson is giving her support to a campaign against a Tesco being built in Belsize Park, North London . Mrs Pollard, a retired college lecturer, said: ‘We brought our family up here. We have a nice, quiet life and that’s what we wanted to keep.’ Brian Viner, 76, and wife Anne, 68, have relished taking part in local flower shows and charity concerts. Mrs Viner, a retired care worker, said: ‘There will be people outside loitering. 'It’ll be worse when they know it will stay open till 11pm. They’ll sit there drinking, doing drugs, and goodness knows what.’ Local estate agent Christian Slade said the store would certainly have a ‘negative impact’ on house prices ‘directly affected’ by it, although he stressed it would only affect houses close by. It is not known when the Co-op store will open. A Co-op spokesman said: ‘Our experience suggests that many customers appreciate being able to use our stores at times convenient to them. ‘Planning officials have concluded that the opening hours will not generate noise or disturbance that would impact upon local residents.’","There is uproar over plans for a Co-operative store to open in South Cerney .

"A federal judge in Boston rejected a third request from lawyers for the Boston Marathon bombing suspect to move his trial outside Massachusetts on Friday, saying jury selection has shown people are capable of being fair and impartial in the place most affected by the deadly attack. Judge George O'Toole Jr. said in his written ruling that 'substantial progress' has been made toward a goal of finding 70 potential jurors. Once that number is reached, prosecutors and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's defense team will then be allowed to eliminate 23 people each for strategic reasons. A panel of 12 jurors and six alternatives will be chosen to decide whether Tsarnaev is guilty. Still on trial: A federal judge on Friday rejected the third and latest request from lawyers for alleged Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to move his trial, which is already under way . If he's found guilty, the same jury will decide whether he lives or dies. Tsarnaev, 21, is accused in twin bombings near the marathon finish line on April 15, 2013. Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured in the attack. He has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors say Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, carried out the bombings to retaliate against the U.S. for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police days after the bombings. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding in a boat in Watertown after the shootout. Tsarnaev's lawyers insist that he cannot get a fair trial in Massachusetts because many here were personally affected by the bombings and many already believe he's guilty. In their latest change-of-venue motion, filed Jan. 22, the defense argued that its analysis of more than 1,350 juror questionnaires showed that 68 percent of potential jurors said they believe Tsarnaev is guilty. They said 69 percent identified some personal connection or allegiance to the marathon or people injured in the bombings. Suspect: Tsarnaev, 21, faces 30 charges stemming from the bombing that left three dead and more than 260 wounded, as well as the later shooting death of a police officer.  He has pleaded not guilty and could face the death penalty if convicted . O'Toole, who has questioned 157 prospective jurors so far, said Tsarnaev's third request to move his trial 'has even less, not more, merit that the prior ones'. 'Contrary to the defendant's assertions, the voir dire process is successfully identifying potential jurors who are capable of serving as fair and impartial jurors in this case,' O'Toole wrote in his order. This week, Tsarnaev's lawyers asked a federal appeals court to order O'Toole to move the trial or to suspend jury selection until he ruled on their third change-of-venue motion. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has not yet ruled on that petition. Included in the motion was a photo of of local bartender Chris Laudani shoveling snow from the marathon finishing line. Tsarnaev's lawyers said the photo - which was widely shared online and published by local media - shows there is still an 'unprecedented level of public feeling' about the event. 'Boston's bias': Attorneys for Tsarnaev argued this photo of a bartender shoveling snow from the marathon finishing line last week shows he will not get a fair trial . Fifteen potential jurors were questioned Friday, including a man who said he was opposed to the death penalty. 'I don't know how many thousands of rounds were shot at that boat. You couldn't kill him then, I'm not going to kill him now,' he said. O'Toole quickly ended the questioning. To serve on the jury, potential jurors must express a willingness to meaningfully consider the two possible punishments in the case: life in prison or the death penalty. Additional potential jurors are expected to be questioned Monday.","Federal Judge George O’Toole ruled the jury selection was successful .

"A mother allegedly suffering from mental illness was found hanging in the basement of her home next to her nine-year-old daughter. Ariana Rosa-Soares, 32, and her young daughter Marley were discovered underground in Brockton, Massachusetts on Friday morning. Police would not comment on whether the deaths were a murder-suicide. A homicide was investigation opened by authorities, who added there is no danger to the public. Hanged: Ariana Rosa-Soares, 32, (left) and her nine-year-old daughter Marley (right) were found hanged Friday morning in the basement of their home in Brockton, Massachusetts . Discovery: Police were called to the house around 9:45am after Rosa-Soares didn't pick up her daughter from a friend's house . Home: This is the house in the Massachusetts suburb where the two were found in the basement. Police say they found 'written material' there, but wouldn't say whether it was a suicide note . Outside the home today, Rosa-Soares's distraught father said he had been worried about her mental state and was concerned she was 'not a good mother'. Jose Rosa told the Boston Globe he was convinced his daughter was mentally unwell, though he could not say whether she had ever been diagnosed. He said: 'My daughter, she is not a good mother... I tried to get help ... to stop what happened now.' Rosa said that the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families had been asked for help. Rosa-Soares was divorced from Marley's father, and has another child, who is 11 and was staying with a friend at the time. She moved to the United States from Cape Verde, an island off the west coast of Africa, around a decade ago. Concern: Rosa-Soares' father, Jose Rosa, above, said he feared something like this may happen, and suspected that his daughter had mental health problems . State police, as well as the local force in Brockton, 25 miles from Boston, are investigating. Autopsies are due in the next few days. The Boston Globe reported that police found written material in the basement, but would not elaborate on the contents or say whether it was a suicide note. Both mother and daughter were found by police around 9:45am after a friend who was worried about Rosa-Soares called police. She had taken her 11-year-old to a friend's house to stay on Thursday night, who sounded the alarm after nobody came to collect her on Friday, despite Rosa-Soares's car being outside her house. Friends told WCVB that Rosa-Soares had spoken about suicide some time ago - but had no immediate suspicions.","Ariana Rosa-Soares, 32, and her daughter Marley found dead on Friday .

"Jean Hughes, 77, was accused of dropping the computer despite insisting the damage had happened when opening it . When Jean Hughes needed a new laptop she ignored cheap online deals and went straight to her local John Lewis because of its reputation for excellent customer service. But the pensioner’s faith in the company was rudely shaken after it disputed the cause of a crack that later appeared in the screen. Staff accused her of dropping the computer despite the 77-year-old grandmother insisting the damage had happened when opening it. After a David and Goliath battle lasting more than a year, she has finally been awarded a replacement after taking her claim to the small claims court. An independent expert’s report she commissioned suggested there was a design fault and a judge found in her favour. John Lewis’s case was further undermined in a humiliating blunder when its legal representative presented statistics for the laptop’s reliability – only for Mrs Hughes to point out they had got the wrong model. ‘For the last three or four months I have had a lot of stress which has affected my skin and eyes,’ said the widow, who lives near St Albans, Hertfordshire. ‘People I have spoken to about this just can’t believe it. You can hear the surprise in their voices. ‘People should be wary of the customer service experience. It is not quite as positive as I’d thought.’ Mrs Hughes bought the Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga at the Welwyn Garden City branch in August 2013 for £399.95. Five months later, she opened it and discovered an eight-inch crack around the edge of the screen. When she took it back to the store, she was told she must have dropped it and should contact Lenovo direct. Surprised but undeterred, she wrote to the manager asking for the two-year warranty to be honoured. She was told the laptop would have to be sent away for the fault to be investigated but it was not until June last year that it was returned to the store. Mrs Hughes was then told she would have to pay £452.64 for a repair – more than the device cost in the first place. Incensed at her treatment, she went to the store to complain on three more occasions before being offered £200 as a goodwill gesture, which she rejected. The offer was repeated at a legal mediation meeting and again at Hertford County Court on Monday, moments before her case was due to be heard. The cracked screen (pictured on the top right corner) thought to have happened because the hinge was too tight and the screen was put under pressure when opened from the side . Mrs Hughes insisted on going ahead with the hearing and was astonished to see evidence presented by John Lewis which claimed it had sold 2,500 units and cracked screens had been reported in just six cases, with all the customers accepting it was caused by accidental damage. The mother-of-two pointed out that the statistics were for the laptop that replaced her model, adding: ‘The woman didn’t know what to do then. We really did surprise her with that.’ A report Mrs Hughes commissioned from an engineer said the damage was likely to have occurred because the hinge was too tight and the screen was put under pressure when opened from one side. She also presented evidence of conversations in online forums where people had discussed the same fault with the same laptop. Mrs Hughes was using the computer on a project she was doing involving voluntary work with children. She won her case after taking it to the small claims court and will be given a replacement and paid court costs . The judge ruled on Monday that Mrs Hughes, who was using the computer on a project she was doing involving voluntary work with children, should be given a replacement device and awarded her £55 to cover the court fee and £54 for the engineer’s report. A company spokesman said yesterday: ‘At John Lewis we always try our best to reach a happy outcome for our customers. The original assessment was carried out by the manufacturer, Lenovo. We believe that the manufacturer is best placed to determine the cause of any fault with an item. ‘However, we fully accept the judge’s ruling and are in the process of replacing Mrs Hughes’ laptop and will cover all of her costs.’","Jean Hughes, 77, accused of dropping the computer by John Lewis staff .

The duchess was attending in her capacity as Patron of the Guild of St Bride’s, which was formed in 1375. During the visit, Viscount Rothermere, chairman of the Daily Mail and General Trust, and his wife, Lady Rothermere, gave her a tour of the Rothermere Memorial Chapel for Associated Newspapers War Dead. The medieval crypt was uncovered during the restoration of St Bride’s after wartime bombing, and was later reconstructed with money from the Rothermere family. Engraved glass in the chapel records the names of the Associated Newspapers employees who fell in the First and Second World War, including Lord Rothermere’s great grandfather’s two sons, Vyvyan and Vere. The Duchess was pictured in front of the Welsh slate cross which hangs in the chapel. She also met some of the Guildsmen of St Bride’s and saw the Journalists’ Altar in the church which serves as a memorial table to the many journalists and support staff who have died while reporting on the conflicts of the 21st century.

"A high school senior has won her case over atheists to keep ' under God' in the pledge of allegiance. Samantha Jones from Highland Regional High School in Blackwood, New Jersey, has defeated efforts by the American Humanist Association to remove the phrase, insisting it is a student's right to read the pledge in its entirety. A judge in Monmouth County threw out the latest attempt to have the phrase banished from the pledge because it did not violate the state's constitution. The teenager described America as a country of many beliefs and claimed everyone, including atheists, are protected by 'one nation under God.' Victory over secularism: Samantha Jones from Highland Regional High School in Blackwood, New Jersey, has defeated efforts by the American Humanist Association to remove the phrase, insisting it is a student's right to read the pledge in its entirety . In a statement released Friday, she said: 'I'm so grateful the court decided that kids like me shouldn't be silenced just because some people object to timeless American values.' 'Ever since I was little, I've recited the Pledge of Allegiance because it sums up the values that make our country great. The phrase 'under God' protects all Americans-including atheists-because it reminds the government that it can't take away basic human rights because it didn't create them.' Eric Rassbach, Deputy General Counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty added: 'The message today is loud and clear: ''God'' is not a dirty word. The Pledge of Allegiance isn't a prayer, and reciting it doesn't magically create an official state religion.' United: Pictured with her parents Frank and Michele she claims everyone, including atheists, are protected by 'one nation under God' Support: The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, who ran this campaign to protect the phrase in the pledge, celebrated the victory, saying it proves God is not a dirty word . The legal battle first began when an unnamed family, identified in court papers as John and Jane Doe and their child, sued the Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District in February 2014, alleging the phrase 'under God' in the pledge is discriminatory. The case was filed by the American Humanist Association, which claimed the recitation of the pledge violates Article 1 of the state's constitution. Samantha was at another school at the time and decided to fight back. She told Fox News in November: 'I don't think that it's as much about religion as it is about our rights. Everyone has the right to remain silent but they don't have the right to silence everybody else.' Relieved: In a statement released Friday, Samantha said she was 'grateful the court decided that kids like me shouldn't be silenced just because some people object to timeless American values.' The Pledge of Alleigance was composed in 1892 by Francis Bellamy, but the phrase 'under God' was not added for around 50 years. Louis Albert Bowman, an attorney from Illinois, was said to be the first person to include the phrase in 1948 while marking President Lincoln's birthday. In 1951, the Knights of Columbus, the world's largest Catholic fraternal service organization, also began including the words 'under God' in the Pledge. It then became a mainstay in schools and institutions across the country. The introduction of 'under God' in the 1950s was done during the Cold War, as a way to differentiate the U.S. from the concept of communist state atheism, according to author Scott Merriman. Proponents of including 'under God' in the Pledge argue the United States is a inherently Christian nation, with at least 80 per cent supporting it, including to Pro Con. Those in favor of it say the language reflects America's civic culture and is not a religious statement, and federal law, state constitutions, and US currency already contain references to God. Opponents contend that church and state should be kept strictly separate as the Founding Fathers intended. They also argue that the Constitution protects minority rights against majority will, thus insist that 'under God' in the Pledge is religious phrase and violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.","Samantha Jones from  New Jersey claimed it is a 'right' to recite the pledge .

"A criminal investigation has been launched in the case of Bobby Kristina, with police considering the possibility foul play may have been involved before she was found face down in a bathtub. According to TMZ the probe, said to be centered around her boyfriend Nick Gordon, began after authorities allegedly found suspicious injuries on the 21-year-old when she was hospitalized on Saturday morning. She remains in a coma in Emory University Hospital after she was found unconscious by Gordon and friend Max Lomas in her Roswell, Georgia home. The site reported that police are looking into claims there was an altercation between Bobbi and Gordon, who are believed to have a history of domestic violence, in the hours before the incident. Lomas also alleges that Gordon cleaned up blood in his house before paramedics and police arrived at the scene. Investigation: According to TMZ the probe, said to be centered around her boyfriend Nick Gordon, began after authorities found suspicious injuries on the 21-year-old when she was hospitalized . 'The odds are against her': Bobbi Kristina's cousin Jerod Brown wrote on his Instagram page on Thursday that 'doctors don't see any hope for change' in her condition as he called for prayers . Vigil: Gordon was pictured outside the North Fulton Hospital, where Bobbi Kristina was first taken, on Sunday . On Friday it was revealed that Bobbi could have been submerged in the bath for between 10 and 15 minutes before she was found. 'It seems like it might've been 10 or 15 minutes that she must have been alone,' Lomas' attorney Ashleigh Merhant told E! News. 'But we don't know at what point she actually ended up in the tub during that time.' Lomas found Bobbi Kristina after he went looking for her when a cable man knocked at the door, E! reported. When she did not respond, he went in and found her, his attorney said. She was rushed to hospital and her family has remained tight-lipped about her condition, but on Thursday, her cousin took to Instagram to provide friends a heartbreaking update. 'Though it seems the odds are against her,' Jerod Brown wrote, 'though doctors don't see any hope for change, though we might want to play detective and find out how she got there, though it looks impossible for her to stand again STILL PRAY FOR BK.' On Thursday, DailyMail.com learned that Bobbi's life-support machine was switched off. 'The plug on Bobbi Kristina has been pulled,' a police source said. It is possible for a patient to survive despite artificial assistance being withdrawn. Bobby Brown did not respond directly to the claims but slammed reports saying that the family were preparing to say goodbye to his youngest daughter. 'This is false, just as is the vast majority of the other reporting that is currently taking place,' he said in a statement on Thursday. Denial: Bobby Brown, pictured leaving Emory University Hospital on Thursday, has denied reports that the family is preparing for the worst. On Thursday, a police source said her life support had been removed . Staying positive: Brown, seen giving a 'thumbs up', has remained hopeful that his daughter will pull through . 'If we issued a statement every time the media published a false report regarding this matter, that's all we would be doing 24 hours a day.' The last official word on Bobbi's condition from the family came on Tuesday when they said in a statement that she was 'fighting for her life and is surrounded by immediate family'. On Thursday, he briefly told Access Hollywood that his daughter was 'good'. He appeared tired and his eyes were red as if he had been crying, the program reported. 'We're praying,' he added. Bobbi's 'devastated' grandmother, gospel singer Cissy Houston, mother of Whitney, was also seen arriving at the hospital, according to Radar Online, having flown in from her New Jersey home. 'Cissy was so traumatized losing Whitney and the pain is still raw from that,' a source told the website. 'Watching Krissy in the hospital and in the coma is almost more than she can handle. This is almost too much sadness for her to bear.' Scene: Bobbi Kristina was found in the bathtub at this townhouse in Roswell, Georgia on Saturday morning . Meanwhile, Houston's mentor Clive Davis says he's been in touch the family and is praying for Bobbi. Davis said he's offered his support and and 'they're so grateful.' 'Of course it's heartbreaking to see the family go through this pain once again,' Davis said at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, where Houston died in 2012 and where he will hold a pre-Grammy gala Saturday. 'They just ask that the public respect their privacy.' Houston died in a bathtub from an 'accidental' drug overdose almost exactly three years ago, in tragically similar circumstances. Authorities found a dozen prescription drug bottles in her Beverly Hills Hotel suite and listed heart disease and cocaine use as contributors, but concluded that she accidentally drowned. Bobbi Kristina was found in eerily similar circumstances on Saturday morning. Questions still remain over what part drugs - if any - played in Saturday's incident; police reportedly found narcotics in the home during a second search last weekend. Police said she was found by her purported husband, Nick Gordon, and a friend, Max Lomas. Lomas' lawyer has since said he was the one who found Bobbi Kristina and started CPR. Missed: Bobbi's mother Whitney Houston, pictured together in 2007, died in a bathtub from an 'accidental' drug overdose almost exactly three years ago, in tragically similar circumstances . Bobby Brown spoke out earlier this week to correct reports that his daughter had married Gordon. Bobbi Kristina and Gordon were brought up like brother and sister after Houston took Gordon in when he was 12. But following her death, the duo announced they were in a relationship. Then last January the couple announced that they had got married, and Bobbi Kristina posted photos of their 'wedding rings' on social media. But on Tuesday a lawyer representing Bobbi's father released the following statement: 'We are currently investigating the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina.' 'To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon,' added Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen LLC. Relations between Gordon and  other family members have been rocky and he remains subject to a protective order barring him from being within 200 feet of Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Patricia Houston.","Authorities she may have ended up in the bathtub because of foul play .

"A woman who regrets an affair with a married man has put a basque he bought her up for auction - and told the full story of its sordid history in the process. Sandra von Riekhoff, 40, from London, who is happily married to the father of her three children, put the worn lingerie on eBay in a bid to put her past behind her and move on. Now a  mother, Sandra says she wants to rid herself of the gifts the 40-year-old gave her when they had an illicit relationship 15 years ago. Sandra, 40, is selling a basque on eBay that was given to her by a married man she once had an affair with . She also slams the £400 basque up for sale, calling it a 'piece of tat'. It was sold for £17 last week . Her tongue-in-cheek posting for the £400 Agent Provocateur corset provides a lengthy 500-word description of the product and pokes fun at the man who bought it for her. She writes: 'It was sold for £400 to 40-year-old man 15 years ago who clearly suffered from an expensive mid-life crisis.' Now older and wiser, Sandra admits she regrets accepting the gifts and 'betraying his wife'. She writes: 'I have shoved this and several other items as listed above in the attic hoping the guilty memories would fade. They don't. I feel rotten for betraying his wife and accepting these gifts, even if she was as rancid as he claimed. 'Fast forward 15 years… I'm 40 now and I have three kids. She was probably doing her best. What 40-year-old woman is still a wildly fun ride with her husband after multiple children?' The events photographer reveals the last time she wore the basque was in 2007 - before her 'udders tumbled towards my lower ribs and before the abs were nicely coated in cellulite and sagging skin'. The advert on eBay in which Sandra reveals was bought for her while she had an affair with a married man . The wording on Sandra's eBay advert for the used underwear - which finally sold online for £17 . Not going for a hard sell, she describes the basque up for sale as a 'piece of tat' that 'makes lovely fleshing breasts appear purple'. Remarkably, it sold for £17 last week. In a interview with FEMAIL, Sandra revealed how she accepted the gift as naive young woman and thought the man was just looking for someone to talk to as he was unhappily married. 'It was about a year of me counselling him over frothy alcoholic cocktails at the Blue Bar in Knightsbridge,' she said. 'I was broke so very glad to play the counsellor in exchange for a chair at London's elite hotel bars in exchange for a good meal and a drink that would have cost a week's wages.' As well as raking her on expensive dinner dates, he also showered her with gifts including a laptop, several Hermes scarves, a Chanel coat, a Bulgari ring and a YSL dress. When he bought the purple basque, Sandra realised he wanted more than just to talk. 'I like to think that my companionship was really enough for him, but once the underwear started to roll in it was clear that he wanted to work with other body parts too,' she revealed. Sandra is selling the underwear on eBay - as well as other items she received from the married man . 'I once let him put his tongue in my mouth which was a revolting experience and managed to use my wits to prevent him from ever doing that again.' Their dates were brought to an abrupt end when his wife discovered they had been meeting. 'His wife found receipts Christmas day and revealed to the entire turkey feasting table what she had discovered,' Sandra said. 'His phone was confiscated and I was contacted. And that was that.' Sandra was left with a wardrobe full of designer gifts and a guilty conscience. So now she's decided to make something positive out of the situation by selling the items he bought he to fund a new business venture. 'I'm eBaying it all to fund my start-up ourfri.com. It's an app that among other things will help you get good recommendations on where to buy good underwear - for, say, Valentine's,' she explained. Sandra has promised to upload more of the gifts onto the online auction site in the near future including a Tom Ford Dress she describes as 'incredibly out of fashion' and a Chanel boucle jacket 'which belongs on some middle aged lunching Botox victim'. Her Hermes scarf is currently on sale - with all proceeds going to charity. 'Thank you for looking at this piece of smutty lingerie. 'I have worn it only while drunk. It looks ridiculous otherwise. Try standing with it on, flat foot in broad day-light. It appears desperate. 'It has been used in bed, only man on woman. If you are bi-curious or strictly lesbian, I'm quite sure she might find this frock as stupidly excessive as I did. In fact it's a completely pointless item. This ad poked fun at the garment, rather than made it sound sexy . 'Chances are that you'll only wear this drunk as well and if you are chances are he/she are in the same boat and will barely notice you have it on. If they do notice, beware, they may want to take a shot of you with their phone and we all understand the dangers of that. 'This piece of wasted time really only pleases the designer who made it. 'It was sold for £400 to 40-year-old man 15 years ago who clearly suffered from an expensive mid-life crisis. 'He bought it for the 25-year-old shop girl on Sloane Street he was trying coax to the Savoy with multiple extravagant gifts. 'By the way, I may also eBay a laptop, several Hermes scarves, black knee high boots, a Chanel coat, a Bulgari ring & a TOM FORD for YSL dress from the same benefactor. 'I have shoved this and several other items as listed above in the attic hoping the guilty memories would fade. They don't. 'I feel rotten for betraying his wife and accepting these gifts, even if she was as rancid as he claimed. Fast forward 15 years…I'm 40 now and I have 3 kids. She was probably doing her best. What 40-year-old woman is still a wildly fun ride with her husband after multiple children? 'I haven't worn this thing since 2007, before I had the children, before my udders tumbled towards my lower ribs and before the abs were nicely coated in cellulite and sagging skin. It's over. I tried Pilates at £50 a session with a bully instructor. I've tried the roll on 'instant results' stomach spreads you have to import from Spain. Jogging gives you 'jogger's face', that sunken hollow look that may mean you've got a fit body, but hell your face looks like the thing Jack Nicholson groped in room 237. 'This lacy French piece of tat is a reminder that 118lbs will possibly be mine once more just before the mortician decides what shade of beige cake to coat my face in for the 'last view'. 'To quote Shakespeare, 'every dog has its day', mine has past. 'Perhaps you've still got a few days left. I suggest heels here, dim lights and a bottle of bourbon. I'm not too bothered about what this thing sells for, but if it does fetch anything at all I will use it towards buying a swim costume that cleverly hides the python wrapped around my waist. 'I'm simply relishing the idea of shoving this purple mistake in an envelope and hoping that with it, I can forget how hot I was once and just be happy that I'm still too young for Tena pants.

"Phil Collins' Swiss ex-wife has been left paralysed after an operation to treat a slipped disc in her neck. Orianne Collins, who was married to the Genesis star for seven years until 2007, now uses a wheelchair following the operation in December. Ms Collins, 42, who has three sons and is remarried, has filed a criminal complaint following the surgery in a hospital in Switzerland. Married: Phil Collins and Orianne's lavish three-day wedding cost £300,000 and hosted guests including Elton John and Eric Clapton . Paralysed: Orianne Collins has revealed she became paralysed after an operation at a Swiss hospital in December . Speaking to Swiss website, Le Matin, Ms Collins said:  'On December 16 I had an operation for a slipped disc in my neck. 'Afterwards, I woke up paralysed. I had absolutely no feeling in my whole body, from my head to the tips of my toes.' It all began when Ms Collins, who has a black belt in mixed martial arts, skis, and played tennis and golf, had persistent pain in her shoulder and neck. She left Miami, U.S. where she lives with her husband and children, for Switzerland because of the 'standard of care' offered in the country. 'We have the best doctors here,' she told Le Matin. 'It was the best solution. I thought I was in good hands.' The disc was removed and replaced with a prosthetic and three days later she was told she could go home. But not everything went to plan and she awoke unable to feel anything and started to panic. An MRI scan revealed she had Brown-Sequard syndrome - a rare spinal disorder that results from an injury to one side of the spinal cord. On December 31, Ms Collins filed a criminal complaint against the hospital, which has not been named, because she 'needs answers'. She is due to be transferred to a rehabilitation clinic. Loved-up: The couple were together for 12 years before their split which cost the Genesis star £25 million in a divorce settlement . Ms Collins, who is a jewellery designer and was born in Nyon, Switzerland, founded the Little Dreams Foundation with her ex-husband. Here they are pictured together in 1994 . Phil Collins' Swiss ex-wife Orianne Collins was left paralysed after an operation to treat a slipped disc in her neck . In 2008, singer and drummer Phil Collins was forced to fork out £25 million to his third wife Ms Collins, nee Cevey, in a divorce settlement. The couple were together for 12 years in total and have two sons together, Nicolas and Matthew. Mr Collins met Miss Cevey on tour in 1994 when she was just 22 and was working as a translator. He was still married to his second wife at the time and was almost double Miss Cevey's age. The couple set up home in Geneva and were together for five years before their lavish three-day wedding costing £300,000 which hosted guests including Elton John and Eric Clapton. They bought racing driver Jackie Stewart's old house in Bugnins, near Geneva, for an estimated £20million before announcing their split in 2006. Ms Collins, who is a jewellery designer and was born in Nyon, Switzerland, founded the Little Dreams Foundation with the Genesis star. The charity fulfils the dreams of young aspiring talents without the money to achieve their goals. She told Le Matin that if she is able to walk again she plans to climb to the top of the Matterhorn, a mountain in the Pennine Alps on the border between Switzerland and Italy.","Orianne Collins is paralysed following operation to treat a slipped disc .

"While security has tightened at the U.S. border, drug smugglers are increasingly turning to the high seas. The area where boats were seized off California and the northwest coast of Mexico tripled to a size comparable to the state of Montana during the 2013 fiscal year, which ended in September. Off South America, traffickers over the years have been traversing territory so big the continental United States could be dropped inside of it. Mexico's Sinaloa cartel has been loading marijuana bales onto 50-foot vessels as far south as the Mexican port of Mazatlan - where its leader, Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, was captured early Saturday - and running them up the Pacific coast to the U.S., deep into California. It's unclear if Guzman's arrest will hinder the maritime runs. Undermanned: The Coast Guard has been hobbled by budget cuts, even as the amount of drugs being traffics by sea surges . Meanwhile, budget cuts have hit one of the lead U.S. law enforcement agencies on international waters - the Coast Guard, the only U.S. military service able to make drug arrests hundreds of miles offshore. To meet automatic federal budget cuts, it reduced its operating costs by 25 percent in 2013. It also lost help from U.S. Navy ships on drug missions off Latin America that were decommissioned and not replaced because of cutbacks, or sent elsewhere because of Washington's new military focus. As such, only a third of suspected drug smuggling boats or aircraft out of South America that were tracked by U.S. intelligence in cocaine-trafficking corridors in the Pacific and Caribbean were stopped last year, the Coast Guard's top officer, Admiral Robert Papp, told The Associated Press. 'Our interdictions are down 30 percent from the year before, when we had more assets out there, so that's an indicator to me that as soon as we start pulling assets away, they're running more drugs and they're getting through,' Papp said. U.S. authorities stopped some 194,000 pounds of cocaine last fiscal year - more than 40,000 pounds less than in 2012, according to Coast Guard statistics.  Marijuana seizures dipped between 2012 and 2013 from 124,000 pounds to 81,000 pounds. This photo taken Jan. 28, 2014, shows the crew of a 45-foot Coast Guard patrol boat runs through their pre-departure briefing in San Diego harbor . Defense officials have warned the cuts would hamper efforts to reach the president's goal of intercepting 40 percent of the illicit drug shipments flowing into the region by 2015. Fighting drug traffickers at sea is crucial because small aircraft used by traffickers can only carry about a ton of drugs versus large boats that can cart up to 20 tons of cocaine or more, authorities said. As much as 20 percent of the cocaine moving through South America ends up in the United States. Large amounts also travel across the ocean into Africa, providing funding for insurgents and drug traffickers, and then on up into Europe. 'We've had to cut back in hours and funding, and cut back on resources on the water,' said Commander Chris German, deputy chief of law enforcement for the 11th District, which stretches from Oregon to Peru. 'The Coast Guard's aircraft and ships have cut back on fuel, so every hour we're not in the air or on the water, it does leave a gap.' Even so, sea smuggling has not grabbed the attention of lawmakers like the flow of illegal goods across the land border, where billions have been spent on beefing up security. Part of the reason is the challenge to patrolling the ocean. This photo taken Jan. 28, 2014, shows Lieutenant Commander Matthew Jones, the Coast Guard chief of enforcement for the San Diego sector . With more than 42,000 active-duty members, the Coast Guard is assisted in the drug war by other U.S. agencies. It works closely with other nations, but that help only goes so far. Bilateral treaties sometimes limit waters it can patrol, and some of the foreign navies are small and underequipped. U.S. officials, for instance, cannot venture into Mexican waters without prior permission and will stop a chase and alert Mexican authorities if suspected boats cross into that territory. Treaties with nations such as Colombia allow U.S. authorities more latitude. 'The land border is a much simpler border to defend. You can put up fences. You can put people out there. But it's a finite area. You know where your land starts and where it ends,' Papp said. 'When you go out into the maritime, it's huge.' The Coast Guard oversees 95,000 miles of coastline and 4.5 million square miles of maritime territory where the United States has rights: 'We don't have that many ships, and we don't have that many aircraft, so there are many different places and routes that the bad guys can take to try and get around us.' Rear Admiral Karl Schultz, the 11th District commander, said the tiny Coast Guard is doing its best to optimize its resources but the challenge is 'like a police cruiser in Cleveland responding to something in Atlanta.' Off California, smuggling vessels are typically spotted by planes from the Coast Guard or a federal agency, such as Customs and Border Protection, California National Guard or the Department of Defense.  Coast Guard or CBP boats are then called to board suspicious vessels. CPB officers are prohibited from firing on boats off the U.S. coast unless the pursuit begins within 12 miles of shore. The Coast Guard has no such constraints, so the onus has fallen on it as smugglers have ventured farther offshore. The Sinaloa cartel has been loading marijuana bales vessels as far south as the Mexican port of Mazatlan and running them up northern Baja California after taking control of that state's coastal territory several years ago, said Michael Carney, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's assistant special agent in charge of investigations in San Diego. Coast Guard officer William Pless communicates on the radio while steering the 45 foot Coast Guard vessel through a dense fog during a patrol off the San Diego coast . Smugglers driving three-engine boats have been landing along remote coasts of Northern California, reaching as far as the beach town of Santa Cruz, which is about 350 nautical miles from the border city of San Diego. That's a shift from the one-engine drug skiffs seen landing for years in San Diego County. Support vessels carry fuel and supplies to go longer distances, and smugglers transfer loads onto U.S.-owned pleasure craft, believing they are less likely to raise suspicion than a foreign boat. Last month, a Coast Guard C-130 plane circled 200 feet over drug runners who jettisoned plastic-wrapped marijuana bales off Mexico's Baja California coast, about 175 miles south of the U.S. border. A Coast Guard inflatable boat closed in each time the three-engine vessel switched fuel tanks, according to Lt. Stephen Davies, who monitored the hour-long, 30-mph chase from a nearby cutter. By the time the four men were arrested, there were no drugs on board, but the Coast Guard fished 3,500 pounds of marijuana and 34 pounds of methamphetamine from the ocean. Papp, speaking at a defense conference this month in San Diego, said that the Coast Guard's resources to patrol the high seas and intercept threats are ""woefully inadequate at this point."" Its aging fleet of larger cutters is being replaced with faster, more capable National Security Cutters, but the number of high endurance cutters best suited for the high seas has dropped from a total of twelve to eight and will remain that way. The service's operating budget will return to 2012 levels this year, but future years are uncertain. Meanwhile, demands for the Coast Guard's 240 cutters, some 1,775 boats, and about 200 aircraft are expanding with the warming arctic and its emerging fisheries, cruise ship routes and commercial traffic. Representative Eliot Engel, a New York Democrat, has called for an evaluation of U.S. anti-narcotics efforts out of concern over the limited successes of the multibillion dollar war on drugs and wants more investment in prevention programs to curb the U.S. market for illegal drugs. 'Drug traffickers continue to find new ways to circumvent our laws,' Engel said. 'Unfortunately, Congress's draconian budget cuts have made the Coast Guard's ability to collect intelligence on and interdict drug traffickers increasingly difficult.' In 2013, the service lost one of its own to traffickers who rammed their 30-foot boat into the small craft of Chief Petty Officer Terrell Horne III, 34, near Santa Cruz Island off Los Angeles. Horne's death drove home the dangers of the war on drugs at sea, said Petty Officer 2nd Class William Pless, 28. 'You never know what you are going to encounter,' said Pless, his gun at his side as he looked into the gray mist hovering over the Pacific waters on a recent evening, miles from the Mexican border.","Drug runners are launching from Mexico and shipping tons of drugs all the way up to Northern California .

"The moon may be a familiar sight in the night sky – but because it's tidally locked to Earth, there is one side of the lunar surface we never see. This side was a mystery for centuries. It wasn't until the Soviet Luna 3 probe visited the area in 1959, that astronomers had any real idea of what it looked like. Now Nasa has released a stunning animation of the moon's far side - once known as the 'dark side' - with Earth looming in the background. Scroll down for video . The animation reveals the phases of the moon from this unusual angle, using data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

It lacks the large dark spots, called maria, that make up the familiar Man in the Moon on the near side.' The animation takes the moon through the 29.5 day period of phases.

From this vantage point, the moon looks full, but on Earth, it's a waning crescent. With a view fixed on the moon, the rest of the solar system seems to dance around it. The far side is also home to one of the largest and oldest impact features in the solar system, the South Pole-Aitken basin, visible in the animation as a slightly darker bruise covering the bottom third of the disk. Its diameter is roughly 1,550 miles (2,500 km), making it stretch across nearly a quarter of the moon. While parts of the crater are shrouded in perpetual darkness, its rim features huge mountainous peaks that are bathed in near-constant sunlight. Esa wants to send robots to these peaks, and eventually humans. It says the crater's rim is an ideal place to land humans because they have 'the potential for near continuous solar power and a spectacular view over the rugged and cratered landscape below.

The far side of the moon could someday be home to human colonies if Esa has its way . The European Space Agency believes that conquering the moon is a crucial step for human deep space exploration. In a video, titled 'Destination: Moon', the agency outlines its plans for making a home on the hostile terrain that covers the far side of the lunar surface. 'In the future, the moon can become a place where the nations of the world can come together to understand our common origins, to build a common future, and to share a common journey beyond,' the video says. Esa is hoping to find out if water exists  on the moon, and if so, they want to understand where it can be found. If the moon has huge stores of water, future colonies could use the hydrogen and oxygen atoms to create rocket fuel. '[This could] propel us further into the solar system and onto the next destination of our journey into the cosmos,' the video says. Future missions could also use the far side of the moon as a shield against radio signals coming from Earth in order to look farther into space.","Because it's tidally locked to Earth, there is a side of moon we never see .

"It was a perfect close up of one of nature’s most magnificent beasts... except for the clenched fist speeding towards the camera. But this powerful right hook is what happens when you start a fight with the king of the swingers by invading his space. The gorilla – intoxicated by a diet of fermenting bamboo stems – spotted Christophe Courteau’s lens pointing right at him. Scroll down for video . Wildlife photographer Christophe Courteau took this astonishing picture a split-second before 6ft 6in, 30 stone silverback gorilla Akarevuro punched him during a visit to Volcanoes National Park - the ape was intoxicated from the fermenting bamboo stems he'd eaten . Akarevuro the silverback gorilla (pictured) appears to have felt threatened by the photographer and mistakenly thought he was a rival . Result: 6ft 6in of 30st gorilla came charging towards the camera – and produced this spectacular close-up. There could be only one winner. Akarevuro the Rwandan silverback thwacked the 46-year-old wildlife photographer effortlessly to the ground. The contest was captured on camera during a visit to the Kwitonda gorilla group in the forest area of Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda. Christophe Vasselin photographed the aftermath as Akarevuro trampled over his colleague. Another photographer, Christophe Vasselin, took these pictures of  Akarevuro the gorilla attacking Mr Courteau at the nature reserve . An angry Akarevuro pushes Mr Courteau over before trampling on him - leaving the photographer with a 'souvenir scar' on his forehead . ‘Akarevuro just ran at me,’ said Mr Courteau. ‘I could not move away because I was taking photos on my knees. 'In less than a second he was on me. He pushed me out of the way as if I was not there. 'I felt all of his power and weight on my body. It was like being hit by a train.’ Mr Courteau escaped with ‘a souvenir scar on my forehead’ and ‘an instant I will remember all my life’.

"Supermodel Gisele Bundchen has always been fiercely proud of her Brazilian heritage - which she demonstrates in a new video as she whistles the country's national anthem. Though she now mainly resides in the US with Superbowl-winning husband Tom Brady and her two children, she has never lost touch with her roots, a point she has stressed in the latest Vogue magazine. The supermodel, who graces the cover of the March 2015 UK edition of the fashion bible for the 14th time, was filmed by Mario Testino in footage for the fashion power house in which she shows off her musical talents. Gisele whistles the Brazilian national anthem in a short film shot behind the scenes on her latest Vogue shoot . Throwing her head back and closing her eyes in concentration, Gisele whistles the anthem . Filmed behind the scenes at the cover shoot for the magazine, the 34-year-old can be seen laughing with the crew as she attempts a British accent, before breaking into the patriotic tune. Throwing her head back and closing her eyes in concentration, Gisele whistles the anthem, at times swinging her fingers along in time, before erupting into giggles. It is not the first time we have witnessed the model's musical talents as she fronted an H&M campaign in 2013 which saw her singing Kinks's All Day And All Of The Night to raise money for UNICEF. However, this much more informal whistled performance was done purely for fun, as Vogue UK challenged the model to do various tasks such as juggle (which she can do surprisingly well), and touch her tongue to her nose (which she can't). The behind the scenes film, which was edited by Mario Testino, also shows Gisele and the photographer hard at work discussing her 14th cover shoot for Vogue . She just knew: Giselle Bundchen revealed she knew from the moment they met that New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was the one for her as she donned a green Chanel outfit for the cover of UK Vogue . In an extended version of the video, Gisele reveals the formula to how she lives her life. 'Do your best, that's my motto. Sometimes you maybe cannot do something but as long as you try that is what matters,' she said. And as the world's highest earning model for several years in a row, this is clearly a motto that is working well for her. In between the laughter we get to see Gisele hard at work, striking poses and discussing the shoot with famed photographer Mario Testino. She shows off her cleavage, incredibly long legs, sun-kissed skin and beachy tresses in military green Chanel. In the accompanying interview she opens up about family life with her husband Tom Brady, 37, who she married 2007. The pair have two children together, Benjamin and Vivian as well as her stepson, John. Gisele told Vogue: 'I'm very nurturing, I come from a large family and my parents were loving. But the most important thing for me as a mum is to keep my word.'

"The Clippers may have suffered a defeat last night but at least one young fan will feel like a winner today thanks to coach Los Angeles Doc Rivers. Rivers, 54, found a a young LA fan in the crowd during the middle of his team's game in Cleveland against LeBron James and the Cavaliers and offered his apologies for how the Clippers were playing. The final score was 105-94, but that margin makes the game seem closer than it was. Scroll down for video . The best apology that Doc Rivers (right) could offer a young LA Clippers fan was a kind word and a fist-bump . The Los Angeles coach was so upset with his team's play that he felt the need to offer an apology . Despite the apology from Rivers, the young LA fan was left mystified by the 105-94 loss to the Cavaliers . Things were so bad for the Clippers, a franchise that has had its share of embarrassing moments over the years, that Rivers found a young fan who was sitting courtside and apologized to him. After exchanging some small talk, Rivers and the boy fist-bumped. The coach, who won a championship while leading the Boston Celtics, added: 'We should have given you a better game today. 'We'll make it up to you, alright? Give me some.' The second-place Clippers found themselves trailing by double digits for much of the game and there was also a three-minute span in the first half where the team was hit with four technical fouls. The Clippers (33-17) have now lost three of their last four. Thanks in large part to the play of superstar James, the Cavaliers (31-20) have won 12 in a row. Following the loss, Rivers said: 'We clearly were not ready for Cleveland's intensity, . 'They came out and attacked us and hit us in the mouth, and we didn't respond. 'I thought basically the entire game they were the first-strike team and we were the retaliators.' Even though his team lost by double digits last night, this Clippers fan left the game feeling like a winner . Rivers was not apologetic while coaching the Boston Celtics and receiving grief from LA Lakers fan Jack Nicholson. Rivers won one championship while he was coaching the Celtics . The Cleveland Cavaliers (31-20) have won 12 in row thanks to the play of their leader, LeBron James . The Clippers played so poorly that Rivers pulled his starters before the fourth quarter even started. He said: 'I should've pulled them at halftime. 'Honestly, I really should've. That was on me. 'I thought about it, because I didn't think we had great energy tonight. I probably should've. 'They kicked our butt.'","The Los Angeles Clippers lost 105-94 to the Cleveland Cavaliers last night .

"Jihadi John, the Briton who beheaded two British and two American hostages held by Islamic State terrorists, has been injured in a US-led air strike, according to reports received by the Foreign Office. The masked ‘executioner’ with a London accent is believed to have narrowly escaped death when he attended a summit of the group’s leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday. The meeting was targeted by American and Iraqi jets. Scroll down for video . The US Air Force attacked a bunker where Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi and Jihadi John were meeting in Iraq . ‘We are aware of reports that this individual [Jihadi John] has been injured, and we are looking into them,’ a Foreign Office spokesman told The Mail on Sunday. This newspaper has received an independent account of how Jihadi John was injured and rushed to hospital after a devastating air strike in Al Qaim, in Anbar Province, Western Iraq. The Foreign Office spokesman added: ‘We have a number of sources of information coming in. ‘The incident occurred last weekend, and so we have received the reports in the last few days. We don’t have any representation inside Syria, and so it is difficult to confirm these reports.’ The Foreign Office also issued an official statement saying: ‘We are aware of reports. We cannot confirm these reports.’ A spokesman for US Central Command said they were unable to confirm the details for security reasons. The joint US-Iraqi mission left at least ten IS commanders dead, and around 40 injured. Those reportedly hurt included IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi. But until now, Jihadi John’s presence at the meeting has not emerged. It is also not known whether Jihadi John was intentionally targeted or merely happened to be present. The secret, heavily guarded meeting took place last Saturday in a makeshift underground bunker beneath a house in Al Qaim. At least 30 tribal elders from various parts of Syria and Iraq gathered to pledge allegiance to Al-Baghdadi, according to our well-placed Syrian source. He said Jihadi John, as a senior IS figure in his own right, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, was also present. Sources claim that Jihadi John, pictured, was injured and rushed to hospital following the surgical airstrike in Iraq which killed ten ISIS commanders, the killer, who has a London accent, murdered Steven Sotloff . Jihadi John was also responsible for the murder of British aid worker Alan Henning, left . According to our source, a nurse who treated the wounded in a hospital in Deir-ez-Zour, confirmed that one of the names on the injured list was Jalman, saying it was ‘the one who slaughtered the journalists’. It is not clear how seriously the British fanatic was hurt, but the source said that both he and Al-Baghdadi were rushed to the Al Qaim General Hospital for treatment. IS members issued urgent calls through the local mosque’s loudspeakers, appealing for the town’s residents to donate blood at the hospital. Our source, who does not want to be identified for his own safety, added that Jihadi John, Al-Baghdadi and the other wounded IS personnel were then driven to Syria, and travelling 200 miles north along the Euphrates valley to the IS stronghold of Raqqa. The injured were taken to two captured Syrian army barracks near the city in the hope that underground medical facilities there would provide protection against further air strikes. The source said that hospitals in Raqqa and nearby Deir-ez-Zour were ordered to take their medical supplies and staff to the secure bases, once the HQs of the Assad regime’s 17th Division and 93rd Brigade. Jihadi John, right, became one of the world's most wanted terrorists after he murdered James Foley, left . Jihadi John, who also murdered David Haines, left, is believed to live in the Syrian town of Al Bukamal . Jihadi John has become one of the world’s most hunted terrorists after beheading British aid workers David Haines, 44, from Perth, and Alan Henning, 47, from Manchester; and American journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31. Footage of the atrocities has been released online, and in the most recent gruesome execution video of Mr Henning, put out last month, the murderer threatened to behead another US hostage, Peter Kassig, 26, an aid worker. British journalist John Cantlie, also held hostage, has been forced to appear in a series of internet propaganda videos for IS. Our source, who has contacts with the IS leadership in Syria, also throws fresh light on the role played by Jihadi John within the terrorist group. Unlike most other western Muslim recruits, he has risen to a position of some seniority. Normally, Western fighters occupy lowly positions, mainly being used as foot soldiers or performing guard duty. Although believed to formerly have been a prison guard for IS, Jihadi John was made a member of a shura council, or governing body, of an IS ‘wilayat’, or province. IS is now controlling large areas of Syria and Iraq, which it has declared an Islamic caliphate. Jihadi John is understood to be in the shura council for the wilayat of Al Furat, an area that straddles the Syria-Iraq border and includes Al Qaim, the scene of the air strike. Our source added that Jihadi John does not live in Raqqa, but in Al Bukamal, a small desert town which borders Iraq. He is aged between 28 and 31, and is fluent in English, Arabic and classical Arabic, the language of the Koran, according to our source. He first joined IS in Iraq when he left the UK, but then moved to Syria. The raid is believed to have injured the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, pictured . The source said that Jihadi John usually travels in a black Audi jeep, and he has six other British terrorists with him who act as his bodyguards. In the confusion following the bombing last weekend, rumours swiftly spread that IS leader Al-Baghdadi had been killed. Last week, in order to scotch those rumours, he issued a 17-minute audio recording, exhorting extremists to ‘erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere’. The Mail on Sunday has obtained an Iraqi intelligence document from the Federal Intelligence and Investigation unit of the Ministry of Interior, which outlines last Saturday’s attack. The document said that Al-Baghdadi was wearing black and first went to a kindergarten building before going to have lunch at an IS leader’s house. It is believed that the air strikes took place when he was meeting the other leaders in a bunker beneath that property. It is understood that Jihadi John has been moved to the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa in Syria, pictured . Muhammad Nasser Delli, an MP for Anbar province, told The Mail on Sunday that local residents confirmed to him that they saw Al-Baghdadi being treated at Al Qaim. He said: ‘A number of people saw him there, but he did not stay at the hospital long. There were lots of women and children that were killed on Saturday during the air strikes.’ The Iraqi intelligence paper also states that Al-Baghdadi was taken to Al Qaim hospital, before being driven to Syria. It lists 16 IS leaders as having been killed in the attack, and nine injured. Among the dead are Abu Huzaifa Al-Adnany, a security guard to Al-Baghdadi, and Abu Quatayba, the cleric of Al Furat wilaya, who would sit in the same shura council as Jihadi John. Also dead is a prominent IS fighter from Chechnya called Abu Abdul Rahman Al-Shishani, says the document.","Jihadi John was in a bunker in northern Iraq with the leader of ISIS .

"An Arizona mom who was convicted of the 2013 murder of her husband - having enlisted the help of her two children and their friends to kill him - was sentenced to life is prison for the crime on Friday. The case of 43-year-old Michelle Dawn Gibson is eerily similar to that of Pamela Smart, the New Hampshire woman who infamously conspired with her 15-year-old lover and three of his friends to murder her husband in 1990. Dawn was found guilty in November of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Her husband, Steven Gibson Sr., was beaten with a baseball bat, stabbed multiple times and had his throat slit, police said. Life without parole: Arizona mom Michelle Dawn Gibson, 43, was sentenced to natural life in prison on Friday for  plotting with her children and a group of teens to murder her husband, Steven Gibson Sr, in 2013 . He was found dead in the family's home in Peoria -  northeast of Phoenix - on March 1, 2013. Michelle Gibson called 911 early in the morning to say she had returned home from shopping trip with her children to find her husband dead in the garage. However, as police were setting up the crime scene, Erik McBee, 17, arrived at the house covered in blood and confessed to the murder. Court documents said Gibson and her teenage son and daughter planned the murder, with the mother alleging domestic violence and saying she feared her husband would kill her. Gibson had offered McBee, a friend of her children, and another teen, Karen Molina-Pompa, $2,000 to carry out the murder, according to AZ Central. Prosecutors argued at trial that Gibson had gone on the shopping trip to establish an alibi. McBee and Molina-Pompa were left in the house as Gibson Sr. went to sleep. Molina-Pompa is accused of holding Gibson Sr. at gunpoint while McBee repeatedly hit him in the head with a metal baseball bat, the court was told. Gibson's son, Steven Gibson Jr., 17, then returned to the home, after being called by McBee, and stabbed his father in the chest. Accessory: Steven Gibson Jr., 17, was sentenced to 22 years prison in July last year for stabbing his father, Steven Gibson Sr., 39 (together-right), to death, as part of a plot organized by his mom . Violent: Steven Gibson Sr. was awaiting aggravated assault charges at the time of his death. Wife Michelle Gibson said she believed he would kill her . McBee then cut his throat. The 911 call was made after Gibson and her daughter, Alysa, arrived home and attempted to destroy the evidence. The son pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and hindering prosecution and was sentenced to 22 years in prison. McBee pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and agreed to testify against Michelle Gibson. He is currently awaiting sentencing. Alysa Gibson and Molina-Pompa are both awaiting trial. Deadly siblings: Alysa Gibson and Steven Gibson Jr. have been separately charged in the murder . Murder plot: Michelle Gibson (front) plotted with her children, including son Steven (back) and a group of teens to murder her husband, Steven Gibson Sr, at their home in Peoria, Arizona, in 2013 . At the trial, prosecutors accused Gibson of manipulating her children and their friends into believing that Steven Gibson Sr. was going to kill her first if they did not act, court records show. Gibson accused her husband of domestic violence. He was  facing aggravated-assault charges at the time of his death. Prosecutors said Gibson wanted to be single and date men she had met online. Police said she began registering for online dating sites four months before her husband's murder and had listed her status as a 'widow'. The victim's mother, Charlene Gibson, read out an emotional speech at the sentencing hearing Friday. 'The morning of the murder Michelle put on Facebook, knowing what was going to happen to him that night, ''It's a beautiful day to live in Arizona'', and I want to say today for her sentencing, ''Yes it is a beautiful day to live in Arizona, because I won't ever have to see you anymore'',' Mrs Gibson said, according to AZ Central. Gibson was sentenced to natural life in prison without parole. The way the saga unfolded is incredibly similar to the story of Pamela Smart. Eerily similar: New Hampshire woman Pamela Smart infamously conspired with her 15-year-old lover and three of his friends to murder her husband, Greggory Smart (pictured together) in 1990 . On May 1, 1990, Smart said she returned home to her New Hampshire apartment to find it had been burgled and that her husband of one year, Greggory Smart, had been murdered. She worked as a media coordinator at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton. Police started following a lead that she had seduced a 15-year-old, William 'Billy' Flynn. It later emerged Smart had threatened to stop having sex with Flynn unless he killed her husband. Flyn and three friends - Patrick 'Pete' Randall, Vance 'J.R.' Lattime Jr., and Raymond Fowler. - shot and killed Greggory Smart. The plot was eventually after another teenager, Cecilia Pierce, who knew about what happened, agreed to wear a wire to entrap Pamela Smart. A 1992 novel inspired by the events, To Die For by Joyce Maynard, was made into a film starring Nicole Kidman. Inspired: The murder trial of Pamela Smart was inspiration for To Die For, a novel and then film starring Nicole Kidman .","Michelle Dawn Gibson, 43, of Peoria, Arizona, was sentenced Friday .

"Brian Williams acted like it was just another day as he appeared on television from the anchor's chair of the NBC Nightly News - without mentioning the mounting firestorm over his professional blunders. Williams, NBC's leading name in news, introduced segments on conflict in the Middle East, as well as extreme weather, even as his earlier reporting on the same topics was pored over by his own network - and rivals. The longstanding anchor made a humiliating apology after admitting a story he told about being on a helicopter hit by an RPG in Iraq was untrue. Scroll down for video . Prophetic? Williams gave no sign of things being out of the ordinary as he faced his own moment of crisis over his misreporting of his time in Iraq - and alleged discrepancies from the wake of Hurricane Katrina, too . He has also been accused of fabricating elements of his time in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, during which he said he saw a body floating down the street, and caught dysentery from flood water. Williams is also at risk from rivals who want his job, according to the New York Daily News. Former NBC presenter, and current Yahoo! News personality Katie Couric, has allegedly been dropping hints that she would like to take his place - if the dent dent in his credibility proves insurmountable. Williams confessed that he 'made a mistake recalling' a flight he took on a Chinook helicopter over Iraq in 2003. 'Made a mistake recalling': Williams, shown left in Iraq and right in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, has found his claims met with scrutiny . He has previously said the aircraft he was on was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade that miraculously didn't explode, and managed to land with no loss of life. In the most extreme version of the tale, told to David Letterman in March 2013, he said: 'Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire, including the one I was in, RPG and AK-47.' In fact, he was on a different aircraft entirely, which by some accounts was as much as an hour behind the one helicopter which was actually hit. He recanted his account after being called out by veterans who really were on the chopper. NBC has launched an official probe into Williams, lead by Richard Esposito, its top investigative journalist. Since the apology, questions were also raised about statements Williams made on coverage of Hurricane Katrina, which was one of his proudest moments at NBC. He claimed to see a body floating down the street in the French Quarter of New Orleans, past the Ritz-Carlton hotel where he was staying. Sore spot: Williams's Friday broadcast opened with an exclusive story from Iraq - the country from which Williams's much-maligned error stemmed . In a 2006 interview he referenced the moment: 'When you look out of your hotel room window in the French Quarter and watch a man float by face down, when you see bodies that you last saw in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, and swore to yourself that you would never see in your country'. Some are sceptical of the story, as the French Quarter was not extensively flooded in the disaster, bringing into question whether there would have been enough water for a body to float down the street. He has also claimed that flood water gave him dysentery, which medics have said was not prevalent during Katrina. Nonetheless, Williams's top two items tonight were on the very subjects under most scrutiny. He led the broadcast with a story from the struggle with ISIS in Iraq, then moved on to the impact of extreme weather in America, included flooding in California. As well as the internal probe, the Daily News also reported that 'a secret task-force' from the rival ABC network is also dredging up old footage of Williams in the hope of finding more claims which do not withstand scrutiny. According to the newspaper, Ben Sherwood, the president of Disney-ABC Television Group, ordered the task-force himself - but the network has strongly denied such a group exists. The News also outlined another threat allegedly closing in on Williams - his former NBC colleague Katie Couric, now a big-name anchor at Yahoo! Global News. A source told the paper: 'Katie still has deep, deep contacts at NBC. She would love to return as the Nightly News anchor... She wants to be back in the big leagues again.' Others denied she had designs on the NBC top spot.","Longstanding NBC host presented Nightly News as normal on Friday .

"Another body part has been found at a Melbourne river where two severed limbs and a bag of flesh have already been discovered. A member of the public found the remains at the Maribyrnong River about 11am on Saturday. Police won't confirm what the body part is, and it's not known whether it was found in the water or on the river bank. It comes  after police released an image of a devil tattoo yesterday, hoping it will help identify the body of a man. Scroll down for video . Police released the image after a forearm - severed at the elbow and wrist - was spotted floating in the Maribyrnong River in Melbourne by diners at a nearby restaurant on Thursday afternoon . The body part found on Saturday was in a plastic bag, police say. Detectives believe the latest find is linked to the other male remains found so far. A severed arm with a red devil tattoo was spotted near the Boathouse restaurant on Thursday, while the other remains were found further upstream. The part found on Saturday was near Oakland Street, which is about 1km away from the restaurant. Water police revisited the river on Saturday morning and remain at the scene.

Part of a limb and a black plastic bag of human flesh were found further upstream when police divers searched the area . Detectives searching the river by boat on Friday morning focused on a bridge about two kilometres from the restaurant where the forearm was spotted. Missing person records are now being scoured by police as the body parts undergo forensic testing. Police say they hope a picture of the devil tattoo found on the inner forearm will help identify the man. 'It was really deemed to be suspicious when a second body part was found,' homicide squad detective Senior Sergeant Stuart Bailey told the ABC. 'I'm not sure exactly what part that is, we do know it's a limb but certainly seeing we've seen a second body part, we do believe it's suspicious.' It isn't clear how long the body parts had been in the river or where they were dumped. 'The examination that'll be conducted by the pathologists we are hopeful will assist in that regard,' Sgt Bailey said.

"A pregnant Tennessee mom was  charged with murder on Wednesday over the starvation and dehydration death of her baby son. Aspiring model Brittany Marie Wiest, 21, who is 24 weeks pregnant, has been charged with aggravated child abuse, aggravated child neglect and felony murder. The little boy, Anakin Leroy-Michael Wiest, was 59-days-old and weighed less than five pounds when was found dead. Police said he weighed almost six pounds when he was born, reports WKRN. Child abuse: Brittany Marie Wiest, 21, woke up last year and her baby son wasn't moving so she called 911. The cause of death was starvation and dehyrdration, and Wiest was charged with his homicide this week . Killed: Anakin Leroy-Michael Wiest, was 59-days-old and weighed less than five pounds when was found dead. He is seen here with his older sister, who is now in state custody . Aspiring model: Brittany Wiest is currently 24 weeks pregnant with another child, her third . Murder: has been charged with aggravated child abuse, aggravated child neglect and felony murder . Police and paramedics responded to a 911 call from Wiest and her boyfriend - who is not the boy's father - regarding an unresponsive infant on April 8 last year. They arrived at the apartment the couple share in the 900 block of Needham Drive in Smyrna. The pair said they had woken up to find the baby not moving. 'She honestly had no clue what had occurred, why the baby had passed away,' Detective Rick Hall told WKRN. 'She just woke up, found the child in the condition it was in and called us.' The cause of death was determined as starvation and dehydration. Detectives classified the death as a homicide. However they spent almost a year investigating before charging Wiest this week. Scene: Wiest lived with her boyfriend - not the victim's father - at the Village Crest apartments in Smyrna . Held: Wiest, who was arrested Wednesday, had her bond set at $100,000 . Neglect: The 21-year-old's son, Anakin, was 59-days-old and weighed less than five pounds . Wiest has had previous run-ins with the Department of Children’s Services for neglect concerning her two-year-old daughter, who is now in state custody. Her daughter and Anakin were to different fathers, as is the child she is expecting. She is being held on a $100,000 bond. Wiest is scheduled to appear in court in Rutherford County on February 17.","Brittany Marie Wiest, 21, charged with child abuse, neglect and murder .

"General Sir Richard has criticised Cameron for risking becoming a 'foreign policy irrelevance' The crisis in Ukraine could lead to ‘total war’, Britain’s former Nato chief warned yesterday. His stark warning came as the French and German leaders flew to Moscow to thrash out a peace deal – without David Cameron. General Sir Richard Shirreff also criticised Mr Cameron for not doing enough to persuade Vladimir Putin to pull back from Russia’s intervention in the country, saying he risked becoming a ‘foreign policy irrelevance’. His comments came as the Defence Secretary said Moscow’s aggression proved the need to update Britain’s nuclear capability. Downing Street insisted Britain is playing an ‘active role’ in Europe’s response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, despite the fact that Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande were spearheading the diplomatic effort to end the conflict. The German chancellor and the French president yesterday met the Russian president in the Kremlin to discuss a peace plan aimed at ending the fighting between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatist rebels. Western diplomats said that Mrs Merkel and Mr Hollande – who on Thursday met Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko in Kiev – went to Moscow with a repackaged version of a peace plan originally drawn up by Mr Putin. The new version is reported to have dropped what were said to have been the most objectionable elements of the Putin plan in order to meet the concerns of the Ukrainians and the Europeans. Sir Richard, Britain’s former top Nato commander, said the UK should be playing a major role in the efforts to resolve the crisis amid fears that it could lead to an all-out European war. Russian President Vladimir Putin, centre,  met with French President Francois Hollande, right, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel - but Cameron was conspicuously absent . He told Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘This is the most serious crisis to have faced Europe, arguably, since the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. 'There is a threat of total war. 'The UK is a major Nato member, it is a major EU member, it is a member of the UN Security Council, and it is unfortunate that the weight that the British Prime Minister could bring to efforts to resolve this crisis appear to be absent.’ And he told the Times that Mr Cameron should be with the German and French leaders in Moscow, presenting the peace deal. ‘Where is Britain? Where is Cameron? He is clearly a bit player. Nobody is taking any notice of him. He is now a foreign policy irrelevance.’ Sir Richard has been quoted as saying Cameron is 'clearly a bit player' when it came to the Ukraine crisis. Pictured: Fighters near Mariupol, in eastern Ukraine . Last night there were also signs of a split between Britain and the US. While US secretary of state John Kerry refused to rule out the arming of Ukraine fighters, UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said such a move risked ‘escalating’ the conflict. Mr Fallon also said Britain must update its own nuclear deterrent in response to Russian modernisation of its nuclear forces. Downing Street sought to play down suggestions of a rift with France and Germany, insisting that the visit was part of the so-called Normandy Group process. ‘It was always clear that it would be a French and German visit,’ said a spokesman.","General Sir Richard Shirreff criticised Cameron in scathing interviews .

"A pensioner who fell ill on a P&O luxury cruise collapsed and died in a budget hotel room after being ‘forced off the ship and abandoned’ at a Mexican port. Beryl Robinson, 84, was told she had to leave the cruise after a bug she is believed to have picked up on board the 950ft Arcadia developed into a chest infection. Mrs Robinson, who uses a wheelchair, had to pay more than £2,100 for treatment in the ship’s medical centre before the doctor insisted she leave the cruise at the next port. Her family, also on the £4,250-per-person trip, said they were told it was a ‘hotel, not a hospital’. Happy: Beryl Robinson, husband Stanley, their daughter Linda and son-in-law John earlier in the cruise . Celebration: Mrs Robinson was on the 24-night cruise celebrating her 62nd wedding anniversary with husband Stanley, pictured together left, and her daughter Linda and son-in-law John, pictured right in 2011 . Luxury liner: P&O's 950ft Arcadia ship, which was travelling from Southampton to San Francisco, California . Mrs Robinson was on the 24-night cruise from Southampton to San Francisco celebrating her 62nd wedding anniversary with husband Stanley, 85, their daughter Linda Wright, 54, and son-in-law John, 56. Mrs Wright said: ‘Mum had been fine before the cruise. She died as a result of getting sick on that ship … forced off it and then dragged from pillar to post. She had been comfortable and stable … but they couldn’t get her off the boat fast enough.’ The sales assistant added: ‘My mother had been a loyal P&O customer since the Seventies … but when it came to her time in need they let her down and just abandoned us in Mexico. My father is devastated.’ The family from Norfolk asked to stay on board for three more days until San Francisco – where they had paid for a hotel and were due to fly home on February 4. Medical records from the ship show Mrs Robinson had responded to treatment with oxygen and antibiotics and had ‘remained stable’. All P&O ships have a medical centre with qualified doctors on board for passengers and crew. But use of the facilities does not come cheap and the cost is not included in the cruise price. Passengers are charged £50 for a consultation before any treatment or medication. Admission to the centre can cost £500 a day plus the cost of any treatment or tests. An injection alone will cost £10 plus the cost of the medicine being injected. All passengers must have travel insurance to cover medical care on board or in a foreign country, including emergency evacuation. Mrs Wright said: ‘She could have safely stayed on board but the doctor said she had to go because “it was a hotel and not a hospital”.’ While Mr Wright stayed on the ship to make arrangements from San Francisco, the rest of the family were left in Cabo San Lucas with nowhere to stay. ‘They arranged an ambulance but then just abandoned us,’ Mrs Wright said. ‘We felt so frightened.’ Mrs Robinson, who used to run a greetings card shop, was taken to a private hospital that demanded $15,000 upfront to start treatment. She suffered ‘unnecessary fear and panic’ over what her daughter said appeared to be ‘sub–standard’ care, adding: ‘They didn’t even wash her for three days.’ Mr Wright, a haulage contractor, said they struggled to get help from their travel insurance so were forced to pay for hotels and medical bills and claim it back later. He added: ‘I had to transfer our savings to the hospital … The insurance company was taking too long.’ Mrs Robinson was one of many passengers who the family say fell ill on the ship – which has been accused of inflicting the ‘Arcadia cough’ on some of its customers. Mr Wright said they noticed fellow travellers coughing within days of the cruise starting on January 6. Toast: Beryl Robinson (left) and Stanley Robinson (right) celebrated as the ship set sail from Southampton . ‘We all picked up this cough but Beryl’s gradually became more profound,’ he said. Mrs Robinson became breathless and was moved to the medical centre. Her son-in-law added: ‘An elderly gentleman was also taken off [the ship] with her. His wife had to sleep on a hospital couch because she had no access to money.' Doctor consultation £52.50 . Medical Centre initial admission £157.50 . Stay for 22 hours £415.80 . Setting up a pulse monitor £23.10 . Pulse monitoring for 21 hours £132.30 . Pulse capnography (graph which shows the pulse) £57 . Oxygen £396 . Setting up the oxygen £15.75 . Delivering the oxygen £8.99 . Disembarkation organisation fee £157.50 . Mrs Robinson was taken off the ship on January 27 and admitted to hospital where she received oxygen and antibiotics before being released three days later. The family then faced the ordeal of getting to San Francisco where they could fly home. Mrs Wright said: ‘We had to find, book and pay for the transport ourselves. My poor mother had to go from taxi to coach to plane to taxi … it was a huge upheaval and incredibly draining.’ Once they arrived on January 30 they planned to stay at the Hyatt where they had a four-night stay booked within the cruise package which also included their flights. ‘We thought it was all booked but P&O had cancelled the hotel and the flights because Linda, Beryl and Stanley had left the ship,’ Mr Wright said. ‘They then refused to help us rearrange them … We had to find the money to pay for flights and a hotel again even though we had already paid for it all.’ The family managed to get flights but while waiting to travel home, Mrs Robinson died in her hotel room on January 31. ‘The doctors said it looked like a cardiac arrest,’ Mrs Wright said. 'Forced off': Mrs Robinson, pictured with her husband on a cruise in 2013, used to run a greetings card shop. She was taken to a private hospital in Mexico that demanded $15,000 upfront to start treatment . ‘The trauma and upheaval had been too much … Our doctor saw her records and said there was no reason for her to come off that ship … I believe she would be here today if it wasn’t for the cough and how P&O treated her.’ To add insult to injury, Mr Robinson later received a call from P&O checking whether his wife had got home safely. Mrs Wright said: ‘He was so upset, he just said, “She never made it home, she’s dead”, and hung up.’ The family, who are making an insurance claim for their costs, must wait for a death certificate before the body can be repatriated at a further cost of £5,000. P&O said the decision to leave Mrs Robinson in Mexico was ‘in her best interests at the time’, adding: ‘Unfortunately it is necessary occasionally for the ship’s medical centre to refer sick patients to a shore-based hospital for specialist treatment.’","Beryl Robinson is believed to have picked up bug on 24-night cruise to US .

"You might think finding six double-yolk eggs in one box is about as likely as discovering a unicorn munching through a field of four-leaf clovers. However, Marks & Spencer has cut the odds to the point where it is a certainty. The chain is launching boxes of six extra-large eggs with every one guaranteed to have two golden, gooey yolks – a product M&S says is ‘perfect for people who think the yolk is the best bit’. Scroll down for video . M&S is launching boxes of extra-large eggs this weekend - with the guarantee each one is a double-yolker . The company say the new boxes of double-yolkers are ‘perfect for people who think the yolk is the best bit’ In normal circumstances, the likelihood of finding just one such egg in a box is about one in 1,000, according to the British Egg Information Service (BEIS). Consequently, the equation for finding six would theoretically be 1,000 to the power of six, which equates to an American quintillion – 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (18 zeros). Farmers at M&S have managed to take the luck out of the equation by opting for young chickens, whose first eggs are much more likely to produce double yolks. Any particularly large eggs from these birds are likely to have multiple yolks, so choosing out the double-yolkers becomes easier. Finally, the eggs are then passed by hand in front of a strong light to check for the double yolk. The BEIS said double-yolkers almost always come from hens about 20 to 28 weeks old, whose hormone systems are not fully developed yet. Normally the chances of finding a double-yolker like this one in a box of six eggs is just one in 1,000 . A spokesman said: ‘In reality it gets its mechanics just slightly wrong. 'You get a young bird and it comes to lay its first egg and it releases more than one egg yolk. It forms a shell around the egg and out pops a rather large egg with two egg yolks in it.’ The yolk is the tastiest and most nutritious part of the egg, because it contains high quality essential fats, vitamins and minerals, including B12, B6, A, K, E and folate. It is also one of the few foods to naturally contain vitamin D, which is important for bones, particularly in children. Yolks also contain most of the egg’s calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, selenium and iron. The British free range double-yolkers, which are extra-large, are available from this weekend for £2.75 for a box of six, compared with a box of the store’s normal large free range eggs, which costs £2.","M&S launching boxes of six extra-large eggs guaranteed to have two yolks .

"Taxpayers have spent more than £10million to stop Julian Assange avoiding extradition to Sweden. The suspected rapist remains holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in central London more than two-and-a-half years since he claimed asylum there. The Wikileaks founder faces immediate arrest on a European Arrest Warrant issued by the Swedish authorities if he steps outside the building. Scroll down for video . WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been at the Ecuadorian embassy in west London since June 2012 . British taxpayers have now spent £10m on guarding the embassy in Knightsbridge where Assange is staying . A team of up to three Metropolitan Police officers monitors the property 24 hours a day after ministers insisted the law must be upheld. The last official estimate for police costs was made in October when it had reached £9million. The figure has since risen by at least £1million. It equates to around £10,500 for each of the 959 days Assange has been holed up in the building, a stone’s throw from Harrods in Knightsbridge. Stephen Greenhalgh, the deputy mayor for policing and crime in London, said: ‘It is an eye-watering amount of money. We do need a diplomatic solution, but ultimately it is the taxpayer who foots the bill.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘Am I frustrated that taxpayers are picking up the tab around the Ecuadorian Embassy? Yes, sure. 'Just imagine the frustration of the Swedish government. ‘This is a country with impeccable democratic credentials, with a well-respected judicial system who say that he should go to Sweden to face very serious allegations and charges of rape, which he denies. 'Of course, the right thing for him to do is to do that and face justice.’ Assange is wanted in Sweden after allegedly sexually assaulting two women in Stockholm in 2010 . In August, Assange indicated he would ‘soon’ leave the embassy but yesterday he showed no sign of giving up. The 43-year-old Australian also hit out at Sweden, saying: ‘Sweden has imported Guantanamo’s most shameful legal practice – indefinite detention without charge.’ His comments came after the country’s director general of legal affairs, Anders Ronquist, said someone could be held indefinitely until they are charged. Assange has been granted asylum by the government of Ecuador but cannot travel there because he will be arrested first. He wants to avoid extradition to Sweden where he is wanted for questioning over claims he assaulted two women in Stockholm, something he denies. Assange believes that if he goes to Sweden, he will be extradited to the US and questioned over classified documents published by WikiLeaks. He has given a series of speeches from the balcony of the building and ‘attended’ conferences around the world by video message. October 2006 – Assange sets up WikiLeaks for anonymous whistleblowers. April 2010 – WikiLeaks reveals a video called Collateral Murder, showing two US military teams shooting a group of men from Apache helicopters. Among those killed were two Reuters war correspondents. July 2010 – WikiLeaks releases US logs from the Afghan War, which includes civilian casualties and the names of alleged NATO informers. August 2010 - During a visit to Sweden a prosecutor orders Assange's arrest for rape and molestation, though this is terminated five days later. September 2010 – After reviewing the original claim, the investigation is renewed by Swedish prosecutors. Assange is arrested in his absence. October 2010 – Iraq War logs are released – the biggest single leak in US military history. November 2010 – A quarter of a million unclassified and confidential diplomatic cables are published  by WikiLeaks. US Attorney-General Eric Holder confirms there is 'an active, ongoing criminal investigation' into WikiLeaks. Swedish prosecutors issue an international warrant for Assange's arrest. December 2010 – US vice president Joe Biden dubs Assange a 'terrorist'. He is arrested by British police and later released on bail. February 2011 – A High Court in London approves Sweden's extradition request. April 2011 – WikiLeaks publishes files from Guantanamo Bay revealing details of detainees. November 2011 – High Court dismisses Assange's appeal against extradition. He takes it to the UK's Supreme Court. May 2012 – Supreme Court upholds the High Court's decision to surrender Assange to Sweden. June 2012 – Assange requests the appeal to be re-opened; Supreme Court rejects this request. Assange then seeks political asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. August 2012 – Ecuador grants Assange asylum, saying there are fears his human rights might be violated if he is extradited. August 2014 - Assange reveals plans to leave the embassy 'soon'. November 2014 - Sweden's Court of Appeal upholds the arrest warrant against Assange.","Julian Assange has claimed asylum at Ecuador embassy since June 2012 .

"A man from Oregon shot his wife two days before Thanksgiving, after learning she was having an affair with his brother. He then turned the gun on himself but failed to kill himself. Raymond Johnson, 38, shot himself in the chest after learning of the devastating news that his wife, Rebekah Johnson, 32, was seeing his brother on the side. The shooting took place outside the couples home in Oregon City. Troubled times: Raymond Joseph Johnson allegedly shot dead his wife Rebekah Johnson in the driveway of their Oregon home after he found out she had been having an affair with his brother for six months . Mrs Johnson, 32, died in hospital the next day. Mr Johnson is being held on bail at the Clackamas County Jail on a murder charge. A trial is scheduled for next year. Court documents show the couple's 17-year-old nephew found the couple laying wounded in their driveway. The teen removed the .38 caliber Taurus revolver away from his uncle's hand and took out the ammunition. The couple's two young children, aged five and seven, were inside the home when the shooting happened. Warning signs? Raymond Johnson's father died two days before the shooting and family members had noticed that he had been 'behaving strangely' Oregon Live say that the family had been undergoing a turbulent time after Raymond Johnson's father died two days before the shooting. During the days following the death it became known that Mr Johnson's brother was sleeping with his wife and had been having an affair for six months but the family only got know of the details on the day of the shooting. Mrs Johnson and the nephew discovered a handgun was missing from the gun safe soon after returning to the couple's home, . After going outside to speak with her husband she was shot in the front yard. According to the affidavit the nephew was in an upstairs bedroom when he heard the commotion outside. He heard his aunt yell, 'No,' before a gunshot rang out. Seconds later, a second gunshot occurred and Mr Johnson fell to the ground. Neighborhood shock: Police seized eight rifles and backpack with ammunition, as well as the revolver, from the Johnsons' home . In the months prior to the deadly shooting, it had been noticed that Mr Johnson had been 'behaving strangely'. Family members had put it down to the fact he was on constant pain medication after a car accident last year and the after-effects of a brain tumor from when he was 20. Police seized eight rifles and backpack with ammunition, as well as the revolver, from the Johnsons' home, according to the search warrant. Raymond Johnson also had bullets in his pants pockets. The incident was one of four fatal shootings involving married couples in Clackamas County since November.

"The Mayor of Calais has demanded that hundreds of migrants in a squalid camp are moved to a comfortable new tented area. Natacha Bouchart has previously warned that migrants in the town are ‘prepared to die’ to reach Britain and its generous benefits. But there are fears the new campsite – close to the port where many try and board lorries heading for Kent – will cause more problems for drivers and British border staff. Madame Bouchart called for a camp known as Jungle 2 to be closed so inhabitants can be moved to more comfortable and hygienic conditions. At least 900 migrants live at the rubbish-infested site, trying to reach the UK. It is feared the new site, which will be close to the Jules Ferry camp, which opened last month, will encourage even more people into the area . Last night a senior British politician said the move was an example of French authorities’ ‘failure’ to deal with the problem – and accused them of offering only a ‘sticking plaster’ solution. The tented site will have washing facilities and be close to the Jules Ferry camp, dubbed ‘Sangatte 2’, which opened last month. That 12-acre centre has beds, showers, toilets, a laundry service and medical facilities for about 2,500 migrants. The new ‘Bouchart’ camp will see ‘guests’ eat meals prepared by a Michelin chef at Jules Ferry. Labour’s immigration spokesman David Hanson MP, who last year spoke of seeing ‘tents on roundabouts’ and ‘bedspreads in bus shelters’ in Calais, said migrants should be stopped from entering France. He added: ‘It is important the French authorities take action to identify who it is who comes to Calais and then determine whether or not they have a legitimate claim for asylum or refugee status or whether they are illegal immigrants … This problem won’t go away till France takes this responsibility seriously and whatever they are doing in providing accommodation is a sticking plaster for a clear French failure.’ The mayor’s plan will see UK-bound migrants moved to the new camp on council-owned land. From next month women and children will be given priority for overnight accommodation at Jules Ferry while men will sleep in tents at the adjacent site. Lorry drivers crossing into Britain already have to check their vehicles for stow-aways,  a desperate migrants try to enter the country illegally . The decision to shut Jungle 2 comes after violent disturbances in August when large numbers began arriving from Eritrea and Ethiopia. Six months ago a judge approved the removal of hundreds of migrants from the camp, which is on privately owned land. But police failed to close it or move its inhabitants. Huge piles of rat-infested rubbish have since accumulated and migrants hacked down trees for fuel. They also broke into a gymnasium where dozens of families now live. Announcing the plans earlier this week, Madam Bouchart said: ‘The aim is to evacuate the company’s land and to protect the migrants.’ But the move is likely to cause more problems for lorry drivers who have to check their vehicles for migrants trying to get to Britain. The mayor’s solution will also anger UK border staff trying to stem the tide of migrants arriving via Calais. Calais residents fear a new camp will encourage a further 1,400 people sleeping rough to head for the site and make a huge ‘tent city’ within weeks. It is unclear how much the new camp will cost but Jules Ferry is expected to cost £6million a year to run – with half of that bill paid from an EU grant partly funded by British taxpayers.","Hundreds to be moved to a new comfortable tented area close to port .

"A Queensland snake catcher has had a frantic week after a spate of calls from households besieged by baby snakes. Local snake catchers were called by three properties in Cairns this week-in Redlynch, Holloways Beach and Caravonica-which were facing an outbreak of hatchling snakes. The snake eggs hatched in the roofs of the houses before they fell down the walls and into the house, releasing groups of up to ten of the tiny serpents. A group of brown tree snake hatchlings found inside a string of properties in Cairns this week . Cairns snake catcher Matt Hagan has had a frantic week removing the hatchlings . Cairns snake catcher Matt Hagan told Daily Mail Australia ‘we received the calls in very quick succession. It was pretty unusual to have an outbreak in three different homes.’ February is the middle of the wet season in Queensland, along with the peak hatching period for an array of reptiles in the area. ‘The eggs are generally incubated about three months after being laid, which is the time floods and the wet season are peaking.’ Hagan said while residents often panic that the hatchlings will mean larger snakes are in the property, the snakes abandon their young at birth and will rarely be found near the hatchlings. February is the middle of the wet season in Queensland, along with the peak hatching period for an array of reptiles in the area . Despite having weak venom, brown tree snakes can appear highly threatening, rearing it’s body into an S-shaped loop and striking viciously at its prey . ‘One of the residents that called me thought the snakes were taipans, which are the most venomous land snakes. Thankfully they turned out to be brown tree snakes, which are only about as harmful as a wasp.’ Despite having weak venom, the snakes can appear highly threatening to humans, rearing their body into an S-shaped loop and striking viciously at their prey.","A spate of Cairns properties experienced an outbreak of brown tree hatchlings this week .

Deccan Traps some 65 million years ago and the Pacific’s huge Ontong . Java Plateau basalts, which buried an Alaska-sized area 125 million to . 199 million years ago. 'These very large, massive eruptions may be tied to some extinction events,' Thorne says. The Ontong eruptions have been blamed for oxygen loss in the oceans and a mass die-off of sea life. This map shows Earth¿s surface superimposed on a depiction of what a new University of Utah study indicates is happening 1,800 miles deep at the boundary between Earth¿s warm, rocky mantle and its liquid outer core. Using seismic waves to probe Earth¿s deep interior, seismologist Michael Thorne found evidence that two continent-sized piles of rock are colliding as they move, creating a Florida-sized blob of partly molten rock ¿ called a 'mega ultra low velocity zone' ¿ which is the beginning stage of massive volcanic eruptions that won¿t occur for another 100 million to 200 million years. Since the early 1990s, scientists have known of the existence of two . continent-sized 'thermochemical piles' sitting on top of Earth’s core and . beneath most of Earth’s volcanic hotspots – one under much of the South . Pacific and extending up to 20 degrees north latitude, and the other . under volcanically active Africa. Using the highest-resolution method yet to make seismic images of the core-mantle boundary, Thorne and colleagues found evidence the pile under the Pacific is the result of an ongoing collision between two or more piles. Where they are merging is a spongy blob of partly molten rock the size of Florida, Wisconsin or Missouri beneath the volcanically active Samoan hotspot. The study’s computer simulations 'show that when these piles merge together, they may trigger the earliest stages of a massive plume eruption,' Thorne says. Black Sand Basin in Yellowstone National Park: Three eruptions at Yellowstone in the US over the past two million years covered much of North America with ash. Now researchers are warning of a new threat under the Pacific which could lead to a new 'supervolcano' eruption . Thorne conducted the new study with Allen McNamara and Edward Garnero of Arizona State University, and Gunnar Jahnke and Heiner Igel of the University of Munich. 'We did hundreds of simulations for . lots of different variations of what the Earth might look like at the . core-mantle boundary – the most simulations anybody has ever done to . look at the core-mantle boundary structure,' Thorne said. 'My study might be the first to show actual seismic evidence that the piles are moving. 'They move around on the core somewhat like continental plates drift at Earth’s surface.' Seismic imaging uses earthquake waves to . make images of Earth’s interior similar to the way X-rays make CT scan . pictures of the inside of the human body. The new study assembled . the largest set of data ever used to map the lower mantle in the . Pacific region by using 4,221seismograms from hundreds of seismometers . around the world that detected 51 deep earthquakes originating more than . 60 miles under the surface. Thorne and colleagues looked for . secondary earthquake shear waves known as S-waves that travel through . much of the Earth, hitting the core, and then convert to primary . compressional waves or P-waves as they travel across the top of the . core. Then they convert back to S-waves as they re-enter the mantle and . then reach seismometers. Thorne says the short bursts of P-wave energy . are very sensitive to detecting variations in the rock at the . core-mantle boundary. Thorne performed 200 days of supercomputer . simulations at the University of Utah’s Center for High Performance . Computing. He simulated hundreds of possible shapes of the . continent-sized piles and state-sized blobs until he found the shapes . that could best explain the seismic wave patterns that were observed. Thorne says the merging piles are each about 1,800 miles diameter, forming a single pile some 3,600 miles wide from east to west and stretching across Earth’s core beneath an area from Australia almost to South America. Two blobs of partly molten rock – called a 'mega ultra low velocity zone', on the piles’ edges merged to form a new blob that is perhaps 6 to 10 miles thick and covers an area about 500 miles long and 150 miles wide, about the area of Florida or 'eight to 10 times larger than any ULVZs we observed before,' Thorne claims. Because the larger piles haven’t fully merged, seismic imaging shows there is a depression or 'hole' between them, and the Florida-sized blob is forming there as smaller UVLZs merge in the hole.","Researchers say eruption could cause 'very massive destruction' on Earth .

"In one of the most lucrative real estate sales in New York City history, a photographer has sold his Bowery home for $55 million are purchasing it for a mere $102,000 just four decades ago. Jay Maisel sold the ornate former bank at 190 Bowery to developer Aby Rosen, according to public court records filed Thursday. The six-story family home hidden inside an imposing Manhattan building had been mistaken for many as a derelict building. Scroll down for video . The impressive 190 Bowery building, a single-family home for photographer Jay Maisel, has been sold for $55 million . Maisel bought the home decades ago and many believed it was actually a derelict building . With graffiti covering the imposing doorway and first two floors, many had believed the building was vacant . Photographer Maisel used his artistic vision to turn the six-story building into a family home, after he bought it for $102,000 more than 40 years ago . As the neighborhood went from tawdry to trendy, brokers and developers aggressively pursued the property. The Daily News reports that Rosen already listed the property for sale with Cushman & Wakefield. Floor plans and pictures published on the site of realtor RFR reveal that inside the building is a quirky family home, with about 35,000sq ft of space, 72 rooms and many features left over from its former life as Germania Bank. Maisel, who lived in the rambling building with his wife Linda and daughter Amanda, uses the first three floors as gallery space, and once rented out the fourth floor to pop artist Roy Lichtenstein. While the living areas were described as being 'very artists live here' by NY Mag, which was afforded a rare glimpse inside in 2008, the 1898 building still has many throwbacks to its banking days. The original vault, said to be the size of studio apartment, is still in the basement; the original copper cage elevator is still used by the family, and it is still possible to make out where the bank teller stations were positioned on the main floor. The first two floors have 18ft high . ceilings, and the remaining floors have 11ft high ceilings. The building . also comes with a pressed tin wall in the dining room, a basement and roof terrace. The ground floor still has many features left over from the building's former life as the Germania Bank . The six-story home has a roof terrace with amazing views across Manhattan . The family have their main living space on the top two floors, with all the bedrooms and bathrooms, and a large kitchen for entertaining, on the sixth floor. When the couple gave NY Mag a tour in 2008 they said that despite the constant cost for its upkeep, they could never imagine selling. Estimates for the value of the New York City Landmark property, in the bustling NoHo part of Manhattan, suggest it could sell for about $50 million, the Real Deal reported. 'I fantasize about never having to worry about money again. It would be great to take the money and run. But let's face it, where are we going to go? A three-room apartment?' Maisel said. Few details, and no guide price is listed on RFR's website, and it has not yet responded to a Mail Online request for further comment. The ground floor is reached through the imposing entrance way, top right, and still has signs of the former bank . Floors two, above, and three, below, are used as gallery space by Maisel . The fourth floor was once rented out by Maisel to Roy Lichtenstein as a studio space .

"A Detroit factory worker who has walked more than 20 miles (32 km) during his daily commute to work for a decade was surprised on Friday with a brand new car, donated by a suburban car dealership. The unexpected gift is the latest in an outpouring of donations from supporters across the globe who, touched by James Robertson's plight, have raised more than $320,000 in an online campaign to help him buy a car. Robertson had told the Detroit Free Press that his car broke down a decade ago and, making $10.55 an hour, he has been unable to save for a new one. Scroll down for video . The unexpected gift is the latest in an outpouring of donations from supporters across the globe who, touched by James Robertson's plight, have raised more than $310,000 to help him buy a car . Robertson has told the Detroit Free Press that his car broke down a decade ago and, making $10.55 an hour, he has been unable to save for a new one . Robertson's story has been widely shared on social media, and Robertson has been featured on national network news programs . 'I don't like it, I love it,' said Robertson, 56, who appeared baffled as he sat behind the wheel of his 2015 red Ford Taurus. 'If only my parents could see me now.' Robertson thought he was going to look at cars to purchase with Evan Leedy and Blake Pollock, who both helped coordinate the gift, worth an estimated $37,000. The newspaper said Robertson takes buses to work, but has to walk more than 20 miles round trip because buses do not cover the whole route . Instead Robertson was greeted by reporters and a team of supporters who first learned of his marathon commute this week in a story that ran in the Sunday Detroit Free Press. The story has since been widely shared on social media, and Robertson has been featured on national network news programs. The publicity has prompted a renewed discussion about reforming Metro Detroit's troubled public transportation system. The publicity surrounding the story has prompted a renewed discussion about reforming Metro Detroit's troubled public transportation system . 'I don't like it, I love it,' said Robertson, 56, who appeared baffled as he sat behind the wheel of his 2015 red Ford Taurus. 'If only my parents could see me now.' An emotional Robertson is overcome by the gift of the car that he said was simple on the outside and strong on the inside, a description he also applied to himself . Leedy, 19, a student at Wayne State University, launched an online GoFundMe.com fundraiser after he read about Robertson's daily trek between his home in Detroit and the Schain Mold & Engineering factory in the suburb of Rochester Hills. He spent part of the week negotiating a reasonable insurance rate for Robertson, who has not driven in 10 years. Leedy told Reuters he was initially quoted a $15,000-a-year premium, a quote that illustrates Detroit's notoriously high insurance rates. The Free Press was tipped off by Pollock, a banker who had befriended Robertson two years ago when he spotted the factory worker walking by his office on his way to work. A finance expert has now assembled a group of advisers to manage the ever-growing fund, which is now 17,500 times larger than his annual wage - or equivalent to eight and a half years' work . The newspaper said Robertson takes buses to work, but has to walk more than 20 miles round trip because buses do not cover the whole route. He starts his commute at 8 a.m. for his 2-10 p.m. shift, and does not get home until 4 a.m. Robertson claims he powers his marathon-like commutes by drinking two liters of Mountain Dew and countless cans of Coke each day. 'I sleep a lot on the weekend, yes I do,' he said, 'but I can't imagine not working,' Although the commute getting into work is grueling, things are worse on the way back as Robertson has to walk the streets alone, in the dark and freezing cold. None of his co-workers lives anywhere near him, so catching a ride almost never happens. He has perfect attendance at his job, the Free Press said. His colleagues have been telling him for years to get a car but it appears that Robertson has fallen into a routine that he almost seems to enjoy it. 'I keep a rhythm in my head,' he says. 'I'm not saying I'm a member of some church. But just before I get home, every night, I say, 'Lord, keep me safe.' About three-quarters of the way home, he has to catch the very last bus of the night at 1am into downtown Detroit - after that it's another five mile trek back to the home he shares with his girlfriend. Robertson thought he was going to look at cars to purchase with Blake Pollock and Evan Leedy, who both helped coordinate the gift, worth an estimated $37,000 . The walk takes him through some shady neighborhoods including Highland Park and the infamous 8 Mile area. Robertson says he was mugged once but doesn't like to talk about the incident. Four hours later he is back home to catch some shut-eye before the long-distance commute begins all over again the following afternoon. 'The last five years been really tough because the buses cut back,' Robertson said. Once he gets to Troy and Detroit, Robertson can take a bus but the schedule is so infrequent the area is really best designed for those that have access to a car. He says that it's not just the $1,700 monthly paycheck that lures him back to work each day but the very essence of being around his friendly co-workers whom he calls 'family'. The boss's wife has also taken a shine to him and prepares him home-cooked meals each evening too. However, the punishing, all-weather hikes now look like a thing of the past for Robertson, . The car is perfect for the machine operator, who said in an interview with the Detroit Free Press that American manufacturers are more his style, has said all he wants is a Ford Taurus, which will set him back some $27,000. The car is perfect for the machine operator, who said in an interview with the Detroit Free Press that American manufacturers are more his style, has said all he wants is a Ford Taurus, which will set him back some $27,000 . He said: 'I'm a Ford fan. I remember the Taurus. They look comfortable, nothing fancy. They're simple on the outside, strong on the inside — like me'. 'I'm 6-foot and I think the Mustang's a little tight,... I mostly stay with Americans cars - Lincoln, Fords, GM, Dodge.' The fundraising campaign for Robertson was started by Evan Leedy, 19-year-old college junior who read his story and decided to raise money for him - initially with a $5,000 goal. As USA Today notes, Robertson lives in Rochester Hills, a community that has removed itself from the SMART bus program depriving him of any fixed-route large buses. The story has drawn focus on Detroit's lack of a cohesive transportation system and its effect on the the high number of residents struggling with unemployment and poverty. 'This is the kind of guy America needs,' wrote Edward Klkotka, who donated $20 to the fund to get Robertson a car. 'Hardworking and dedicated. He has the type of character that every employer dreams about.' Leedy and Robertson met at a bar in Rochester, Michigan, ahead of a round of national press interviews. At the encounter, Robertson said: 'I'm always going to be in your debt — I will never forget this.' The teen responded by showing him some comments left alongside the donations - many of which said that he deserved the money for his decades of hard work. The fundraising campaign for Robertson was started by Evan Leedy, 19-year-old college junior who read his story and decided to raise money for him - initially with a $5,000 goal. Although the fund was originally just meant to get Roberston - whose last ride was a decrepit Honda which gave up in 2005 - a new set of wheels, the fund could now do much more. The cash is likely to help with medical and dental expenses, as well as longer-term commuting expenses like gas, repairs and insurance. The interviews and meeting were orchestrated by Blake Pollock, a UBS banker who saw Robertson's commute, sometimes gave him lifts, and first told the press about him.

"Walmart . heiress Paige Laurie Dubbert's ex-husband has claimed she's a cheater who . is trying to distract attention from her affair by accusing him of stealing thousands of dollars from her. Patrick Bode Dubbert accused his wife of six years and high school sweetheart of cheating last year, he claimed. The Walmart heiress, 32, filed for divorce on March 7 citing irreconcilable differences. The unhappy heiress also filed a civil lawsuit where she accuses her husband of stealing thousands of dollars from their Malibu retail center business. Paige and Bo, (pictured right with Walmart executive Richard Thomas) dated during their senior year of high school and married at a top-secret wedding in Columbia, Missouri, in June 2008. The couple are now in the midst of an embittered divorce . The lawsuit alleged that Bo convinced his wife to let him hire a friend as co-manager, then the two men made . themselves general contractors and upped their salaries to $70,000 a . month. She also alleged that her husband also paid himself $250,000 a year to manage the project on top of the other fees. According to legal documents seen by TMZ, Mr Dubbert says that his estranged wife is simply trying to deflect from her alleged wrongdoing to 'spin an image of Paige to the media as a victim'. A source close to Paige told MailOnline today: 'This is a pathetic and desperate attempt to use a completely baseless claim to try to smear Paige. 'This totally unsubstantiated false fabrication of an alleged affair is simply a desperate attempt by Bo to divert attention away from the actual substance and reality of the case to try to grab as much money as possible.' The couple married at a top-secret wedding in Columbia, Missouri at the family home in June 2008. According to blog Shabina Says So, the nuptials took place in two mammoth tents - one which resembled a cathedral for the ceremony and the second with velvet walls for the reception. Paige Laurie, pictured at a GRAMMY Awards Party in 2005 in LA, divorced her husband in March this year citing irreconcilable differences . The bride wore two couture wedding gowns, one by Carolina Herrera and the second evening dress by Jenny Packham. It was attended by 600 guests and the partying went on until 6am. The young couple had signed a prenup which not only protected her fortune, but also . provided her husband with the right to spousal support if they ever . divorced. Paige isn't contesting that amount that she agreed to pay, reports TMZ and plans to change her name back to Elizabeth Paige Laurie. She is the daughter of Nancy Walton Lawrie, the youngest daughter of Bud Walton, the brother and business partner of Walmart founder Sam Walton. Nancy and her sister Ann Walton Kroenke between them own a stake in the retail behemoth worth more than $6 billion. Mother and daughter caused controversy in 2004 when they made a $25 million naming rights gift towards the building of a new $75 million basketball arena at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri. Nancy and her husband Bill Lawrie decided to name the facility Paige Sports Arena after their daughter. Neither . parents nor daughter had ever attended the university, instead Paige . graduated that year from the University of Southern California. A former roommate told ABC’s 20/20 that she had been paid $20,000 over four years to do Paige's homework for her. Once the allegations emerged, Paige’s parents agreed to let the school rename the arena which is now known as Mizzou Arena. In 2005 Paige voluntarily surrendered her USC communication degree. Paige and Bo first met back in high school during an ACT prep course and dated briefly during their senior year of high school. Four years later they bumped into each other at an LA nightclub and rekindled their romance. Bo proposed to Paige in December 2006.","Paige Laurie has not only filed divorce papers against Bo Dubbert but also a civil lawsuit alleging that he stole from her during their six-year marriage .

"Bobbi Kristina's devastated grandmother has visited the 21-year-old's bedside to join the family's heartbreaking vigil hours after her cousin said the 'odds are against her'. Cissy Houston, the mother of late singer Whitney, was seen walking into Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, on Friday to join a vigil with other family members. The 81-year-old former gospel singer used was surrounded by relatives and a bodyguard as she prepared to visit her granddaughter who is said to be still fighting for her life. A few hours later she was seen leaving with a walking stick. Bobby Brown, Whitney's former husband, looked emotional as he was seen leaving the building with his wife Alicia Etheridge on Friday evening after some reports emerged that life support had been switched off. Their visits came as reports suggested a criminal investigation, focusing on Bobbi's boyfriend Nick Gordon, into the incident had surfaced. Scroll down for videos . Showing the strain: Bobby Brown looked emotional as he left the Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Friday evening with his wife Alicia Etheredge . Family support: Cissy Houston is seen walking  away from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, to after she was at her granddaughter Bobbi Kristina's bedside . Assistance: She is seen with a walking stick as she makes her way to the car with other members of her family. They have today insisted that they are not preparing to say goodbye to the 21-year-old . Memories: Cissy was said to have been 'devastated' when she heard of Bobby's condition as she was still traumatized by the death of her daughter, Whitney . According to TMZ, suspicious injuries found on Bobbi when she was taken to hospital made them suspect foul play may have been involved. Jerod Brown wrote on Instagram on Thursday that 'doctors don't see any hope for change', but her father has slammed claims the family are preparing to say goodbye. Bobbi was found unconscious by her partner Nick Gordon and friend Max Lomas in her Roswell, Georgia home. Lomas discovered Bobbi Kristina after he went looking for her when a cable man knocked at the door, E! reported. When she did not respond, he went in and found her, his attorney said. It was revealed on Friday that she could have been submerged for around 15 minutes before she was discovered. She was rushed to hospital and her family has remained tight-lipped about her condition, but on Thursday, her cousin took to Instagram to provide friends a heartbreaking update. 'Though it seems the odds are against her,' Jerod Brown wrote, 'though doctors don't see any hope for change, though we might want to play detective and find out how she got there, though it looks impossible for her to stand again STILL PRAY FOR BK.' Cissy was seen visiting the hospital on Thursday having flown in from her home in New Jersey.

Together: The 81-year-old spoke to her bodyguard (left) and another family member for the visit . Vigil: She arrived at the hospital hours after sources told the Daily Mail Online the 21-year-old's life support machine had been switched off . Tragic: Bobbi Kristina, pictured with her partner Nick Gordon, was found unconscious on Saturday morning . By her side: The family have not responded directly to claims life support has been switched off, but have slammed claims they are preparing to say goodbye to the 21-year-old . One person told the website: 'Cissy was traumatized losing Whitney in 2012 and the pain is still raw from that. 'Watching Krissy in the hospital and in the coma is almost more than she can handle. This is almost too much sadness for her to bear.' She was also the most outspoken against the film about her daughter, which premiered last month. 'Lifetime has chosen to go ahead with the movie about Whitney in spite of my family's objections,' the bereaved mother said in a statement to Entertainment Tonight in June. 'No one connected with this movie knew Whitney or anything about her relationship with Bobby.' On Thursday, DailyMail.com learned that Bobbi's life-support machine was switched off. 'The plug on Bobbi Kristina has been pulled,' a police source said. It is possible for a patient to survive despite artificial assistance being withdrawn. Bobby Brown did not respond directly to the claims but slammed reports saying that the family were preparing to say goodbye to his youngest daughter. Protection: Other family members were also accompanied by a body guard as they arrived at the hospital . 'This is false, just as is the vast majority of the other reporting that is currently taking place,' he said in a statement on Thursday. 'If we issued a statement every time the media published a false report regarding this matter, that's all we would be doing 24 hours a day.' The last official word on Bobbi's condition from the family came on Tuesday when they said in a statement that she was 'fighting for her life and is surrounded by immediate family'. On Thursday, he briefly told Access Hollywood that his daughter was 'good'. He appeared tired and his eyes were red as if he had been crying, the program reported. If Bobbi passes away before she inherits the full amount of her mother's will, it will go to Cissy Houston and her sons, Michael and Gary, according to the will's terms. Father: Bobby Brown, seen outside of the hospital on Thursday, has slammed claims the family are preparing to say goodbye to the 21-year-old . 'The odds are against her': Bobbi Kristina's cousin Jerod Brown wrote on his Instagram page on Thursday that 'doctors don't see any hope for change' in her condition as he called for prayers . Family: Cissy, pictured with her daughter in 1989, could stand to gain some of her granddaughter's inheritrance if she passes away . Houston died in a bathtub from an 'accidental' drug overdose almost exactly three years ago, in tragically similar circumstances. Authorities found a dozen prescription drug bottles in her Beverly Hills Hotel suite and listed heart disease and cocaine use as contributors, but concluded that she accidentally drowned. Bobbi Kristina was found in eerily similar circumstances on Saturday morning. Questions still remain over what part drugs - if any - played in Saturday's incident; police reportedly found narcotics in the home during a second search last weekend.

"An EU plan to log drugs sold at chemists on a national database could threaten confidentiality, experts have warned. Under changes due to come into effect by 2018, every packet of medicine passed over the counter in Britain will have a unique serial number which will be recorded on a centralised computer system. This number can be scanned at the point it is given to the patient, verifying it is legitimate. The overhaul of administering over-the-counter and prescription drugs is part of a crackdown by Brussels on counterfeit products flooding the market. An EU plan to log drugs sold at chemists on a national database could threaten confidentiality, experts have warned . But as part of the proposals, the drug's serial number will be linked to the patient's records in the pharmacy to allow the medicine to be traced if problems arise later or if it needs to be recalled. Currently, pharmacies are not connected to outside databases so information is only stored locally. The fear is that if hackers get into the central database they could access confidential information, such as patients' names, ages, addresses and medical histories. Phil Booth, of the patient campaign group Med Confidential, said: 'Linking drugs that have been prescribed to patient details is incredibly dangerous and the risks on confidentiality are immense. 'The drugs that you take indicate the condition that you have, which is highly sensitive information.' The changes are being introduced under the EU Falsified Medicines Directive, passed in 2013.

"Twenty-eight inmates escaped from a Brazilian jail after three women in sexy police costumes 'seduced' the prison wardens. Police found three wardens naked and handcuffed inside the morning after the mass breakout at Nova Mutum public jail near Cuiaba. Investigators say the women drugged the guards with spiked whisky after convincing them to take part in an orgy. Temptress: Three women wearing 'sexy' police outfits and sexy lingerie (pictured) tricked the wardens into letting them in by promising them an orgy . They arrived at around 3am on Thursday morning and asked if they could come inside to 'chat and drink', police say. The prison guards obliged and were soon persuaded to leave their posts, before heading to the sleeping quarters with the scantily clad women. After drugging and handcuffing the wardens, they took their keys and unlocked all the prison's cells according to police chief Angelina de Andrades Ferreira. She told a news conference: 'The plan was to seduce them. They served them cheap whisky with some substance to knock them out, then unlocked the central gate which accesses the internal cells. 'Whoever wanted to escape left by the front door. From the moment they drank the whisky the agents don't remember a thing. 'One was found dizzy, trying to wake up. Another slept for the whole afternoon and couldn't even be questioned.' Dozens of prisoners walked straight out the main door carrying guns and ammunition they took from the prison caches. The inmates took three 12-calibre rifles, shotguns, two 38-calibre revolvers and munition, she said. Police later discovered a bag of lingerie and skimpy leather police uniforms which they believe the temptresses wore to distract the wardens. Blame: The prison guards will now be charged with 'facilitating a jailbreak' and 'culpable embezzlement' because some prisoners walked out with weapons from the prison cache . Ms Ferreira said the escape was orchestrated by the boyfriend of one of the women who tricked the wardens. Bruno Amorim - who was one of the 28 that escaped - was serving time for attempted murder, robbery and firearms possession. A photo of one of the prison guards - lying face down without trousers on - was reportedly leaked by the police officers who found him. It has since been shared thousands of times on social media networks. The police chief said the three prison officers had been arrested and will be charged with 'facilitating a jailbreak' and 'culpable embezzlement' due of the theft of firearms. Last night, eight of the prisoners were recaptured after the police launched a massive manhunt to track down the fugitives. One inmate was found wandering around the centre of Nova Mutum in a drunken state, waving one of the stolen rifles. Another was caught after stealing a stealing a pick-up truck from a farm and crashing it, police said.","Three women turned up to prison in skimpy lingerie and police costumes .

And he mocked the memory of Whitney Houston – the woman who gave him a new life – upon his arrest, just nine months after her tragic death. Gordon was clocked driving his Chevrolet Camaro SS sports car at 82 miles an hour in a 35 miles an hour zone near to his home in Alpharetta, Georgia, at 7.06pm on 28 November 2012. But when he was stopped he put Whitney Houston music on his car stereo as the police officer approached. The singer took Gordon under her wing when he was 12 years old. Whitney Houston raised the boy as her own son at her home outside Atlanta but never legally adopted him. She was found dead in the bath tub of her room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in February 2012. Authorities found a dozen prescription drug bottles in Whitney's suite and listed heart disease and cocaine use as contributors, but concluded that she accidentally drowned. Bobbi Kristina was found in eerily similar circumstances on Saturday morning. Charged: When he was stopped he put Whitney Houston music on his car stereo as the police officer approached, Atlanta police state. A court date was originally set for February 2013 but was pushed back . Now he must appear at the Fulton County State Court in Atlanta on Monday morning to answer the charges . According to TMZ, suspicious injuries found on Bobbi when she was taken to hospital made them suspect foul play may have been involved. Jerod Brown wrote on Instagram on Thursday that 'doctors don't see any hope for change', but her father has slammed claims the family are preparing to say goodbye. Bobbi was found unconscious by her partner Nick Gordon and friend Max Lomas in her Roswell, Georgia home. Lomas discovered Bobbi Kristina after he went looking for her when a cable man knocked at the door, E! reported. When she did not respond, he went in and found her, his attorney said. It was revealed on Friday that she could have been submerged for around 15 minutes before she was discovered. She was rushed to hospital and her family has remained tight-lipped about her condition, but on Thursday, her cousin took to Instagram to provide friends a heartbreaking update. Gordon was pictured visiting Bobbi at a vigil on Sunday, three days before he is due in court. A court date was originally set for February 2013 when he was first taken to Alpharetta jail, but the case was adjourned. Vigil: Gordon was pictured outside the North Fulton Hospital, where Bobbi Kristina was first taken, on Sunday . Now he must appear at the Fulton County State Court in Atlanta on Monday morning to answer the charges. A police source told DailyMail.com: ‘Gordon was clocked doing over 80 along North Point Parkway. ‘This is a suburban area he was lucky he didn’t kill anyone. ‘And when he was stopped he slipped this Whitney Houston CD into the player like it was some kind of joke.’ The police report states: ‘On 11-28-12, I was conducting speed enforcement on North Point Parkway northbound at Regal Cinema. ‘I observed a vehicle travelling southbound at an extremely high speed. ‘I activated my laser speed detection device and clocked the vehicle at 82 mph in a posted 35 mph zone. ‘I conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle and made contact with the driver, Nicholas Gordon. ‘He was immediately arrested for reckless driving.'","25-year-old was caught driving at over twice speed limit in Nov 2012 .

"Victim: Raja Fayad, a graduate director and expert in colon cancer, was gunned down at the University of South Carolina's Public Health Research Center . A Lebanese cancer researcher was shot and killed by his ex-wife during a murder-suicide on the University of South Carolina's campus months after he reportedly moved out of the couple's home so he could be with another woman. Sunghee Kwon gunned down graduate director and colon cancer specialist Raja Fayad several on Thursday afternoon in a fourth-floor office at the university's Public Health building. Kwan then committed suicide with a gunshot to her stomach, the coroner said. A 9 mm pistol with an empty magazine was found near the bodies, State Law Enforcement Division spokesman Thom Berry said. Kwon, 46, and Fayad, 45, were divorced a few years ago, but continued to live together until they split up for good a few months ago, Watts said. Kwon was still living in the couple's home near Lake Murray in Lexington County, while Fayad had moved to a long-term hotel with a family member, according to the coroner. Neighbors said Fayad, who completed his MD in Syria before moving to the United States, recently ended a 'stormy relationship' with a woman he was living with, described as his girlfriend. Fathi Elsahli told The State the situation had deteriorated when he moved out to be with another woman. Fayad and his ex are believed to have moved from Chicago, where Fayad had been teaching. She settled in August after getting a job, but then lost it, the paper reported. Helena Sanford, who lives next door, said the Faya's ex girlfriend told her that Internet service and electricity had been cut off at the home. She told the paper: 'It's devastating. It's a terrible waste of life.' Fayad came to USC in 2008 from the University of Illinois-Chicago as an associate professor in the Arnold School of Public Health, according to his online biographical information. He earned his MD at Aleppo University School of Medicine in Syria in 1995. Many students rated Fayad highly before his death, suggesting he made Exercise Science 223, a anatomy and physiology course, bearable. On the anonymous review site Rate My Professor Fayad earned a 4.7 on a 5.0 scale. Some of the comments included were: 'Dr. Fayad is the man. He is super laid back and loves the material he teaches. ... One of the best professors I’ve had. Lockdown: Heavily armed and armored police from Columbia, South Carolina swarmed the campus on Thursday afternoon after a gunman opened fire . Precautions: There was no longer any active danger almost immediately following what many reports have called a murder-suicide . Another read: 'Take this professor. He is awesome! He knows what he is teaching and seems interested in his research.' Much of the campus remained on a complete lockdown in the aftermath of the shooting even though police said danger from the 'very isolated' incident was over. A perimeter was set up around the public health building, where police carrying AR-15s and wearing SWAT gear ushered students out and across the street. At 2:15pm, the school's Carolina Alert system sent a second message out telling students and staff there was no longer a threat. 'There was no active shooter other than the two deceased,' said State Law Enforcement Division spokesman Thom Berry. According to The State reporter Amanda Coyne, some professors even taught through the lockdown. The shooting happened a couple of blocks from the Statehouse and two blocks from the university's basketball arena. The street is one of the city's busiest. Sirens could be heard as more police officers arrived at the public health building. Shots fired: The University of South Carolina campus in Columbia was put on lock down and students told to shelter in place following a 1:20pm shooting Thursday . Law enforcement officials gather on the campus of the University of South Carolina in Columbia after shots were fired at its new School of Public Health on Thursday . An alert was also issued to employees at the South Carolina Statehouse in Columbia, where personnel performed security sweeps as a precautionary measure. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley also cut short a news conference over security concerns. Student Hayden Dunn, a senior from Myrtle Beach, said he was in the building about 1 p.m., getting in an elevator to change classes, when a police officer also got inside. Dunn said the officer asked whether anyone had heard gunshots, but they hadn't. Dunn said he went to class, then an alarm sounded five minutes later, and people rushed outside. Another office told him shots had been fired, he said. 'Otherwise, you wouldn't have known anything happened,' Dunn said. The shooting occurred in or near the relatively new Arnold School of Public Health as police in SWAT gear with AR-15 secured its perimeter and ushered away students .","Raja Fayad, 45, was gunned down at the Columbia campus on Thursday .

"A timelapse showing the first design changes to an EasyJet aircraft since 1998 has been released to celebrate the company's 20th year of flying. There are two main design changes. EasyJet's trademark orange has been extended from the tail fin on to the fuselage to create a larger space for the easyJet logo which is 15 per cent bigger than before. Secondly, an orange stripe reflecting the design language of easyJet's advertising has been introduced on to the fuselage. It's the first easyJet re-design since 1998 as the company moves into its 20th year of flying . This enables the easyJet logo to be reversed out of that colour - in accordance with brand guidelines - and to give the plane a sleek, more modern look.‎ . Finally, the '.com' has been dropped. Peter Duffy, easyJet's commercial director, said: 'EasyJet's aircraft livery is one of the most recognised in aviation. 'As we approach our 20th birthday in November, we felt a refreshed livery would complement the many changes already made to easyJet including allocated seating, transparent prices, flexible tickets and our award winning mobile app.' The airline currently has a fleet of 226 Aircraft – a mixture of A319s and A320s. The new livery will feature on all new easyJet aircraft deliveries from April 2015. EasyJet has 197 Airbus A320 aircraft on order, the majority of which will replace older A319 aircraft currently in the fleet. A timelapse video shows the work it takes to give the easyJet aircraft a fresh, new look . The long logo is sprayed off the main shell as the company aims for a sleek new look to the plane . In addition, younger planes in easyJet's fleet will have the new livery applied when they ‎are scheduled to be repainted, typically every six years. Taken together this means 29 aircraft will be flying with the new look by the end of 2015 and 50 per cent of the fleet will sport the new livery by the end of 2017. A specialist team is needed to repaint an aircraft which takes around seven days on average. During easyJet's 19 year history there have been only two aircraft styles. The first, seen in 1995 on easyJet's first aircraft, was different to anything else flying as it advertised the booking number along the fuselage in giant lettering. Imagine if all planes looked like this? Thankfully this is only half-way through the design process . The final design was selected by a poll of 4,000 members of easyJet staff . The second, which entered service in 1998, displayed easyJet.com across the fuselage which reflected the important move the airline made to online booking. Alex Wood at Holmes Wood design agency who worked with easyJet's in house engineering team on the new livery said: 'We have spent a lot of time getting to know the personality and attitude of the easyJet brand and this new livery design was a direct translation of that. 'EasyJet's recent brand update reflected their growth from low cost airline to one of Europe's largest carriers and with this came a new attitude and a new confidence - one that wasn't reflected in their current livery. EasyJet's trademark orange has been extended from the tail fin on to the fuselage to create a larger space for the company logo . Out with the old and in with the new! This design will slowly disappear from the easyJet fleet . 'This new livery is a carefully considered design evolution that is both confident and fresh and we feel it reflects easyJet's ethos of modern simplicity. ' Andreas Ossenkopf, head of aviation at Mankiewicz, who provide the coatings for the aircraft added: 'Mankiewicz is very proud to be the chosen coatings supplier to easyJet. 'We take great pride in the manufacture and supply of the most high quality and innovative Aerospace Coatings. EasyJet and Mankiewicz have the same philosophy to combine quality with efficiency and we are delighted to support the high quality image of easyJet.'","Trademark orange has been extended from the tail fin on to the fuselage .

"Almost 20 passengers got off a Malaysian aircraft as it was about to take off after they heard the pilots arguing in the cockpit, it has been revealed. The loud argument scared the passengers as the plane, owned by Malaysia-based Malindo Air, was minutes from take-off at Penang Airport for a scheduled one-hour flight to Kuala Lumpur on Thursday. After an apology from the pilot, many of those who had disembarked agreed to get back on board, but seven refused to take that flight. The plane finally took off with the remaining 52 passengers after a 50 minute delay. Scroll down for video . Almost 20 passengers got off a Malindo Air plane on Thursday after the pilots were heard fighting . Small incidents, such as strange engine noises on planes have worried numerous Malaysians in the wake of the disappearance of MH370 and the shooting down of MH17. The Star Asia News Network reported on Saturday that it had learned of the latest 'walk off' incident through a Facebook post, supposedly written by a friend of one of the passengers. Later, one of the passengers, identified only as Mr Kee, said they had all heard a loud yell from the cockpit when a stewardess opened the door to come out. Mr Kee said the pilot and the co-pilot were apparently having a 'serious fight.' The flight was leaving from Penang Airport headed to Kuala Lumpur . He told The Star: 'It was so loud that all the passengers were shocked. 'A foreigner sitting on the front row then stood up and asked for permission to leave the aircraft. About 20 of us followed him. 'We went into the airport building and after a while the pilot came down from the plane to apologise to us and invited us back on board.' Mr Kee said that while most of the passengers chose to go back, he and six others, including the unidentified foreigner, believed both the pilot and co-pilot were unfit to fly due to their emotional condition. He told the newspaper that he and the others lodged a report at the airport police station. The plane took off when most of the passengers returned to the flight, but seven refused to fly . Mr Raja Sa'adi Raja, public relations director for Malindo Air, apologised for the delay and the misunderstanding, claiming the situation could have been misinterpreted. 'The captain was instructing a third observer-trainee pilot in a stern manner as he and the co-pilot prepared for take-off,' said Mr Raja. He told The Star that on hearing the loud instruction a passenger decided to get off due to reasons unknown and about 18 others followed. Mr Raja said the pilots apologised 'for the uncomfortable situation that could have been misunderstood by a handful of passengers.'","20 passengers disembarked a Malindo Air plane just before take-off .

"As any chocoholic will attest, whether it's in a bar or melted into fondue, a hit of the sweet brown stuff can be difficult to resist. And now chocolate lovers can take their addiction to a whole new level thanks to the chocolate shooter - a device that allows people to snort cocoa powder. Based on old Victorian snuff shooters, the device was invented by Belgian chocolatier Dominique Persoone as a novel way to enjoy his favourite sweet treat. Scroll down for video . Sweet sniff: Belgian chocolatier Dominique Persoone invented the chocolate shooter as a novel way to eat the sweet treat for a Rolling Stones party in 2007, but the idea has since caught on . Chocolate hit: Mr Persoone, 46, has spent a long time developing his own chocolate powder mix filled with ginger and mint after discovering that raw cocoa powder was too dry . Snort: The diner fills two spoons with the powder which is fixed to a trigger mechanism. A push of the lever then fires the chocolate up either nostril . He originally made the device for a Rolling Stones party in 2007, but  the concept has taken off and been used by culinary innovators such as Heston Blumenthal at his restaurant The Fat Duck. Diners are given a special mix of Dominican Republic or Peruvian cocoa powder mixed with raspberry, ginger and mint to snort. They pack the powder into two small spoons fixed to a trigger mechanism, then hold the device close to their nose and press the lever, sending it shooting up their nostrils. The tattoo-clad 46-year-old said: 'The mint and the ginger really tinkle your nose. Then the mint flavour goes down and the chocolate stays in your brain.' It has taken him years to develop the perfect snorting powder, as early experiments with pure cocoa powder revealed it was too dry. Perfection: Before landing on his current mix, Mr Persoone was using a combination involving chili pepper, which he says was 'a very bad idea' in hindsight . Sexy: Mr Persoone says there is a 'kinky' appeal to snorting the chocolate, but denies that he is promoting drug use, saying the device is just a bit of fun . Novelty: The chocolate shooter sells for around 45 Euros (£30) and has been used by the likes of Heston Blumenthal at his restaurant The Fat Duck . Before he hit on the tingling sensation of mint and ginger, he was using a mix which contained chili. 'It's a very bad idea,' he said. The chocolate shooters, which sell for 45 Euros (£30) each, have been exported to Russia, India, Canada, Australia and the United States. The packaging bears a warning against excessive sniffing, but Persoone insists it is safe. He was inspired by the role of the nose when tasting food and, he says, a certain idea of fun. He added: 'The mentality when you think about sniffing is: ""Oh it's kinky, guys who do that stuff...'"" 'I'm not the bad boy promoting drugs, not at all ... Life is boring. Let's have fun.' Straight to the brain: Mr Persoone says the ginger and mint open the nasal passages and make the face tingle, while helping deliver a pure hit of cocoa .","Chocolate shooter was designed by Belgian Dominique Persoone, 46 .

"After fighting with Comcast for months just to get her service fixed, Mary Bauer got a bill from the cable giant that let her know just how annoyed they were by her requests. The Illinois woman saw the bill in her mail addressed to 'Super B---- Bauer.' 'I said, wait, I need to get my glasses on because I don't believe what I'm seeing,' she said. 'And there it was: Super B---- Bauer. So I've had it with Comcast.' Scroll down for video . Illinois woman Mary Baeur got a bill from Comcast addressed to 'Super B---- Bauer' after fighting with the cable company to get the Hallmark Channel back in her package . While the issue was finally fixed, she didn't get a bill in November only for the late notice to show up with an extra $50 tagged on to the bottom line. She says she's been battling with the company since last April, calling 'hundreds of times' as she tried to get them to restore the Hallmark Channel to her line-up. CNN Money reports that while the issue was finally fixed, she didn't get a bill in November only for the late notice to show up with an extra $50 tagged on to the bottom line. The company told her her two-year contract had expired and that the channel was now included in a more expensive service. She finally agreed to a higher rate to get it back. Bauer's story almost made it to air on a local station, but the broadcaster was owned by Comcast and the story was killed before it could come out. Another station agreed to air it and she got an apology from a Comcast manager just a minute before showtime. 'We are continuing to investigate this thoroughly, and have reached out to our customer to apologize and try to make it right,' the company wrote. Small comfort for Bauer. 'Comcast is just the most disingenuous company on the entire planet,' she said. 'I've been totally frustrated with them for a very long time.' Lisa Brown also had an insulting experience, saying the cable sent her a bill addressed to 'A**hole Brown' The company, which has the worst customer service rating in the U.S. according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, is getting a reputation for insulting mailings. Cancelling cable is an unpleasant experience for most, but one couple were horrified when they then received the following month's bill addressed to 'A**hole Brown'. Lisa and Ricardo Brown said they wanted to cancel the cable on their Comcast account - which cost them $60 - after suffering financial difficulties. But Mrs Brown said the customer service representative transferred her to a retention specialist who attempted to persuade her to keep the cable and sign a new two-year contract. When the couple, from Spokane, Washington, received their next bill, Mr Brown's name had been changed from Ricardo Brown to 'A**hole Brown.' And shockingly, when Mrs Brown tried to get the profanity removed and name corrected, she faced difficulties. She contacted consumer advocacy writer, Christopher Elliott. Mrs Brown, who has been a Comcast customer for two years, told him: 'I was never rude. It could have been that person was upset because I didn't take the offer.' Lisa and Ricardo Brown were shocked to receive this bill addressed to 'A**hole Brown' after they tried to cancel their cable from Comcast . On his blog, Mr Elliot wrote: 'It’s no secret that employees sometimes feel their customers are jerks. 'But I’ve never seen one put it in writing — until now.' Steve Kipp, Comcast's vice president of communications for the Washington region, apologized for the 'completely unacceptable' incident after being contacted by Mr Elliot. Consumer advocacy writer Christopher Elliott contacted Comcast on behalf of the Browns . In a statement, he said: 'We have spoken with our customer and apologized for this completely unacceptable and inappropriate name change. 'We have zero tolerance for this type of disrespectful behavior and are conducting a thorough investigation to determine what happened. 'We are working with our customer to make this right and will take appropriate steps to prevent this from happening again.' Mrs Brown was contacted by Rhonda Weaver, a Comcast senior director of government affairs, who promised to waive the $60 cancellation fee. Ms Weaver also said Comcast was investigating the name change and would terminate the employee who was responsible. But Mrs Brown felt this was insufficient, adding: 'This is unacceptable. I am requesting everything back I paid Comcast for doing this to me.' Mr Elliot reported that Comcast has offered the Browns a full refund of the two years' worth of bills they have paid.","Mary Bauer had fought for months to get her favorite channel back .

"In the wake of the Christchurch office sex romp-which saw a married father caught cheating in a string of viral images-many are questioning how much they can trust their partners. For some, this means enlisting extra support to give them peace of mind, and that’s where Lipstick Investigations come into play. The Sydney based company is Australia's highest profile investigation business to specialise in infidelity, and they've been flooded with business in the New Year. Scroll down for video . Lipstick Investigations is Australia's highest profile investigation business, and they say they have been inundated with business of late . Managing director of the company David King said: 'It’s a certain type of person that will seek an investigator. Most people will see the clues and call it quits, but some need more closure' David King, the managing director of the company, told Daily Mail Australia the investigations are conducted across a number of fields. ‘We primarily deal with surveillance, but we also delve into database work and internet investigations. It varies from case to case,’ he said. Investigations typically begin with a phone call to the client, which sees the investigator ask two dozen questions to establish the plan of attack. ‘It’s a certain type of person that will seek an investigator. Most people will see the clues and call it quits, but some need more closure. It’s can also come down to cultural differences.’ A unfaithful partner caught in the act by Lipstick Investigations, who claim to have an 80 per cent success rate . King said harsh anti-surveillance laws in Australia hinder the equipment they can use on jobs, such as computer hacking and electronic tagging . Clients are charged a flat rate of $95 an hour, and while some jobs take a handful of hours, some can drag on much longer. ‘We had one client who spent half a million dollars over four years. We had plenty of evidence, but it was a drawn out case and it ended up becoming quite complicated.' King says the company also handles an array of other investigative work. ‘Private investigations are a very small industry. We take on anything from council work to companies trying to catch out employees taking a sickie.’ King said harsh anti-surveillance laws in Australia hinder the equipment they can use on jobs. ‘We’re pretty hard up. We can’t do electronic tracking, can’t hack into accounts. The office incident in New Zealand would be an ideal result for us, because that’s working within the parameters of the law.’ He said most of his results come from conventional surveillance, which includes the use of forensic tools, hidden cameras and night-vision equipment. They also arrange honey-trapping job, where a decoy is sent into partners favourite watering hole or gym to flirt with them and see what happens next, to catch out infidelity before it has even happened. The investigations include the use of use of forensic tools (pictured), hidden cameras and night-vision equipment. David King (pictured) said he takes on anything from council work to companies trying to catch out employees taking a sickie . ‘Social media has really transformed the industry. There is a drop in business because people can do the process themselves, chasing the leads of their partner on Facebook and such.’ ‘The other side of the coin is social media means there are more digital footprints left that could spark suspicion. So we can more clients from that. I think the overall workload is the same, it’s just a different dynamic.’ King says the work is consistent throughout the year, with a surge in business on certain obvious dates such as Valentine’s Day. ‘You can never put your finger on busy times. We just had the busiest January since we started our business, but I couldn’t tell you why.’ A recent study from Lonergran Research showed that one in four Australian's admits to cheating on their partner, while two-thirds of couples don’t share their deepest secrets .

King said investigators are occasionally spotted by investigators . When asked if the investigators ever get caught in the act, King said: ‘Ultimately we’re not invisible, and we do get caught out sometimes. We can’t be ten blocks behind the suspect.’ He said investigations have about an 80 per cent success rate, but that ‘it would be a 90 per cent if clients had more money. Generally, if you have suspicions they are probably warranted.’ You can see the official Lipstick Investigations website here .","Lipstick Investigations is Australia's highest profile investigation business .

But despite his behavior, he was hired by JP Morgan Chase & Co, kept on during massive job cuts and could have later been offered another position if he had replied to the firm's queries. The reason for this, according to emails obtained by the Wall Street Journal, was because his father had promised to 'go extra miles' for the multinational bank if it did not fire his son. Now, federal prosecutors are looking at Gao Jue's hiring as a potential violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, according to the Journal, which cited people with knowledge of the inquiry. The Act bans giving anything of value to foreign government officials to get ahead in business. Prosecutors are investigating the Asian hiring practices of JP Morgan and other banks. JP Morgan's decision to hire Gao Jue in the summer of 2007 was reportedly 'widely understood' within the company to have been supported by William Daley, a senior executive at the bank at the time. Mr Daley, who worked at JP Morgan from 2004 to 2010, is also a former U.S. commerce secretary and served as White House Chief of Staff to President Barack Obama from January 2011 to January 2012. He had reportedly met with Gao Hucheng, then China's vice minister of commerce, in July 2006, while he was working at JP Morgan. At the time, Gao Jue was in his final year at Purdue University. The meeting was apparently set up by Sherry Liu, a Hong Kong-based J.P. Morgan banker, who had previously advised Mr Daily a 'good in-depth relationship' with China would be beneficial to the firm. Mr Daley later told Ms Liu his meeting with Gao Hucheng - who was promoted to his current position as minister in March 2013 after a high-flying career - had been 'very good', according to the emails. Making promises: Gao Jue reportedly performed poorly in job interviews and was described by a senior banker as 'immature, irresponsible and unreliable'. But despite this, he was  kept on by JP Morgan after his father (pictured, left, with US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner) promised to 'go extra miles' for the bank . Bank: On one occasion, Gao Jue, 32, even accidentally sent a sexually explicit email to a human-resources employee at JP Morgan (file image), for which he was given a warning, according to internal emails . Several months later, Gao Jue was offered a two-year analyst position at JP Morgan in New York. Despite the offer, the candidate was said to have performed abysmally in his  interviews. One recruiter, Danielle Domingue, detailed Gao Jue's performance in an email to her colleagues. According to the Journal, she wrote: 'Jue did very very poorly in interviews - some MDs (managing directors) said he was the worst BA (business analyst) candidate they had ever seen - and we obviously had to extend him an offer.' During his time at JP Morgan, Gao Jue was accused of performing 'poorly' and behaving in an 'irresponsible and inappropriate' manner. Below are some of his alleged offenses - and his subsequent treatment by the company. ALLEGED BEHAVIOR . - Performed poorly in job interviews (some managing directors reportedly said he was the worst BA candidate they had ever seen) - Failed to renew his work visa, so the bank had to help him apply for an H-3 training visa, which prohibits 'productive employment' - Was described by a senior banker as 'immature, irresponsible and unreliable'. - Sent a sexually explicit email to a human-resources employee at the firm . TREATMENT BY JP MORGAN . - Was hired by the company following his 'poor' interview performance . - Was kept on amid major job cuts . - Could have later been offered another position if he had replied to the firm's queries . - Was given a written warning for the sexually explicit email . Nearly a year later, Gao Jue received a layoff notice from JP Morgan alongside many of his colleagues. However, after his father reportedly intervened, he was saved from being let go. 'The father indicated to me repeatedly that he is willing to go extra miles to help JPM in whatever way we think he can,' Fang Fang, then CEO of China investment banking for the firm, wrote. He added: 'And I do have a few cases where I think we can leverage the father’s connection.' During Gao Jue's time at JP Morgan (he was eventually terminated in March 2009 amid major job cuts and now works for Goldman Sachs), he allegedly made a number of mistakes. One of these was letting his work visa expire, so the bank had to help him apply for an H-3 training visa, which prohibits 'productive employment', according to the emails seen by the Journal. Another was inadvertently copying a HR employee into an email featuring inappropriate sexual remarks, it is claimed. This move led to Gao Jue being handed a final written warning. 'Jue was given a written (last) warning last Friday and advised that his conduct and activities will be monitored closely and any further violation would lead to termination,' Anil Bhalla, a New York-based senior banker who handled Asia clients, wrote to Mr Fang in an email. 'That said,' he added, 'there is general consensus among the seniors in our group as well reports from people in his previous group that he is immature, irresponsible and unreliable.' Despite his behavior, Gao Jue was repeatedly saved from being fired, it is alleged. At one point, Mr Fang apparently asked Mr Bhalla if he would take the employee onto his team of analysts. And later, the firm was reportedly prepared to offer him a position on a different scheme. But amid the support for Gao Jue, Mr Daley reportedly declined to help save his job, saying he should 'move on'. 'Involved: Gao Jue's hiring was reportedly 'widely understood' within the company to have been supported by William Daley (left), a senior executive at the time. Meanwhile, Fang Fang (right), then CEO of China investment banking for JP Morgan, reportedly said the firm could ' leverage [Gao Hucheng's] connection' JP Morgan (which Mr Fang has since left), Mr Daley (who is now in charge of US operations at a Swiss hedge fund), Gao Hucheng and his son are not accused of any wrongdoing, it is reported. Gao Jue's name had not previously been reported in connection with the hiring probe, which JP Morgan disclosed in a 2013 regulatory filing. A JP Morgan spokesman declined to comment. Th 2013 filing, which was part of a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice in the US, has damaged JP Morgan's business in Asia, according to the FT. The bank pulled out of two high-profile initial public offerings, Tianhe Chemicals and Everbright Bank. A Goldman Sachs spokesman also declined comment. Mr Daley - whom two employees referred to as being supportive of Gao Jue's initial hiring in emails - refused to discuss Asia hiring practices. Former role: Mr Daley, who worked at JPMorgan from 2004 to 2010, is also a former U.S. commerce secretary and served as White House Chief of Staff to President Barack Obama (pictured, right, with Mr Daley) in 2011 . Despite the email claims about Mr Daley, the former JP Morgan Chairman of the Midwest did not have an ongoing relationship with Gao Jue nor his father, a person familiar with the matter said. The Chinese commerce ministry is not a client of JP Morgan nor a banking regulator, but can rule on mergers among multinational companies that do business in China, the Journal reporrted. The U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are expected to reach a settlement with JP Morgan related to the U.S. antibribery law. This may involve a fine. It could also reportedly warrant an overhaul of the bank's hiring practices..","Gao Jue, son of Gao Hucheng, hired by JP Morgan in New York in 2007 .

"David Osborne said consent must be considered in rape cases even if given when 'blind drunk' A barrister has sparked fury among rape victims after insisting men should not be convicted if the woman is drunk or on drugs when sexually assaulted. Writing in a blog post titled 'She's gagging for it', David Osborne protested 'consent is consent, blind drunk or otherwise'. The Somerset-based barrister added rape statistics would drop if women 'covered up and did not drink themselves legless.' His comments have been slammed by rape victims and support groups as 'vile'. Spurred by the Crown Prosecution Service's announcement last month that defendants must prove a a woman not only gave consent to sex but was in an able state of mind to do so, Mr Osborne said: 'I have always found it distasteful and unattractive the suggestion that as the victim was blind drunk she (was) therefore unable to give her consent to sex, or more to the point, she gave her consent which she would not have given had she been sober. 'In my book, consent is consent, blind drunk or otherwise, and regret after the event cannot make it rape,' he continued the post. 'I have a very simple solution which I hope you will agree is fair. If the complainant (I do not refer to her as the victim) was under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or both, when she was ‘raped’, this provides the accused with a complete defence. 'End of story and a victory for fairness, moderation and common sense!' Mr Osborne's comments were lambasted by rape victims and charities this morning. Siobhan Ames-Bell, whose step-father was jailed for raping her last year, said: 'His comments are absolutely vile. 'If a person is not in a position to consent then it is rape. 'Sex is a choice, when both people involved are not in consent then it is rape.' The views of Miss Ames-Bell, who waived her anonymity to campaign on behalf of other rape victims, were echoed by the End Violence Against Women Coalition who described Mr Osborne's comments as 'sick'. Mr Osborne made the controversial comments in a blog post titled 'She was gagging for it' on his website . 'I find it hard to believe this is not some kind of sick joke or a parody,' Sarah Green, the Coalition's director told the Daily Mirror. 'He is suggesting the opposite of the law.The guy is a barrister and there’s no way he doesn’t know all this.' Defending his comments, Mr Osborne said the decision on whether or not a woman is fit enough to have sex should not be left up to 'the red-blooded bloke'. ‘After sexual intercourse has taken place whilst a girl was clearly drunk, when she sobers up and then says “I wouldn't have consented had I been sober” I'm saying very firmly: “bad luck”,' the barrister told MailOnline this morning. ‘Why should the responsibility for making these decisions be placed upon the bloke? 'The red-blooded bloke out on the town, there to enjoy himself, if he thinks that someone is likely to consent and he makes the usual enquiries as you do, obviously he should whether she is underage  but beyond that I don't really see why the responsibility for determining whether sexual intercourse takes place with consent and with consent freely given, is entirely the responsibility of the accused person. Rape victim Siobhan Ames-Bell (left) described Mr Osborne's comments as 'vile'. The barrister penned the controversial blog post following the announcement by Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, (right) that the law needed to be adapted to shift blame from rape victims who had been drinking . ‘I think that is wrong I think that is unfair, I think it should be a more balanced approach. 'The point I'm trying to make is not that drunken women are not a free-for-all for irresponsible men, what does concern me and that was the reason why all this has started is that the pendulum has swung too far the other way by saying there may be factors which may not be known to the accused at the time but that will subsequently come out which will assist the jury and I say that's totally unfair.’ Mr Osborne was speaking of the recent announcement by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, who said more should be done to determine whether a woman was fit to give consent in alleged rape cases. ‘It is not a crime to drink, but it is a crime for a rapist to target someone who is no longer capable of consenting to sex through drink,' Mrs Saunders said last month. Mr Osborne however said women who were 'unwilling to behave properly' 'In towns and cities across the country, girls who shouldn't be out on the street at all, are inappropriately dressed and getting completely rat-arsed. ‘I'm talking about vulnerable girls, clearly are not either willing or able to behave themselves properly and when I say this I mean dress appropriately and don't drink to excess. ‘These problems then arise where she finds herself finding sexual intercourse with a bloke and then she finds herself saying she didn't consent.'","David Osborne said consent given when drunk should be considered .

"A worried father who clocked nearly 80mph in a 30mph zone to save his daughter's life has been spared a lengthy driving ban. Ricky Bunting, 23, frantically drove home after his girlfriend called to tell him his two-month-old daughter Ava had turned blue and stopped breathing. He arrived back at the house to find Ava 'lifeless' and rushed her to the the hospital in his van, Rotherham Magistrates Court heard. She was diagnosed with severe bronchitis and made a full recovery after treatment, although she has been in and out of hospital since with breathing problems. Worried: 23-year-old Ricky Bunting (right) raced home after hearing his two-year-old daughter Ava (pictured) has stopped breathing . Ricky, from Wath-upon-Dearne, South Yorkshire, pleaded guilty  to the speeding offence in May last year. The tyre fitter admitted to driving his company's Skoda Fabia van at 79mph on High Street, near Bellows Road, Rawmarsh at 7.52 am. The speed camera snapped him on his journey back to the house he shares with girlfriend Kealey Tinker, and again en route to the hospital. Magistrates were told the speed would usually warrant an automatic and lengthy disqualification - because it was well over sentencing guidelines for speeding offences. Phil Jones, mitigating, said Ava's condition was not a medical emergency as defined in law and therefore not a special reason for discretion over a banning order. Mr Jones asked magistrates to ban him immediately for two weeks to coincide with Mr Bunting's holiday from work, which would mean he kept his job. Scared parents: Speed cameras snapped Ricky Bunting (left) on his way home from work after his girlfriend Kealey (right) said his daughter had 'turned blue' But he added: 'It explains why he was driving so quick, but doesn't excuse it. 'Yes, he was driving extremely quickly, yes it is unacceptable and should be punished and if you were to impose such a disqualification he could remain in employment.' Magistrates told Bunting it was a 'very dangerous' speed. He was fined £400 with £85 costs and was banned from driving for two weeks. Afterwards he said Kealey and Ava, now 10-months-old, had been in and out of hospital with breathing problems. He added: 'Everyone's doing fine now and it's a relief not to be banned for longer and risk losing my job.'","Ricky Bunting rushed home after hearing his daughter 'stopped breathing'

A student's eyesight was so bad he turned up to the wrong exam room after misreading a sign and subsequently missed his exam. The long list of embarrassing blunders stretched from the awkward, such as the maths teacher who confused students by misreading a minus sign as an equal sign, to the downright dangerous. Several people took a trip to the opticians after accidentally driving the wrong way down a one-way street while one driver mistook traffic bollards for children in the road. In one ironic case, a visually-impaired woman had strolled into a High Street opticians and began taking off her shoes and socks- thinking she was at the foot specialist next door. Other eyesight related mishaps include a regular better who was forced to have an eye test after he could no longer read the names of horses in the Racing Post, and another person turned for help after being unable to cut their own toenails.

Despite finding themselves in these embarrassing and sometimes dangerous situations, more than one in three of the 2,000 people questioned said they put off having an eye test for 'months' after noticing their eyesight worsening. Dr Susan Blakeney, clinical adviser to the College of Optometrists, said: 'Although these anecdotes may be extreme examples, there is a serious message behind this. It is important to be aware of the health of your eyes and to seek professional advice early if you notice any changes to avoid these sorts of accidents. 'We see too many people who leave it weeks or months after noticing problems before they go to see an optometrist.

More than 60 air strikes battered the city, with locals running for their lives as the bombardment continued. Photographer Abd Doumany, who took the pictures, said the assault caused chaos and said: 'This is the worst day in Douma in four years.' He added: 'The situation in the hospitals is very bad. There are shortages of everything.' He said medics had been wounded in the shelling and terrified residents were forced to hide out in their basements.

"TurboTax, the country's most popular do-it-yourself tax preparation software, halted processing state tax returns for about 24 hours because of a spike in fraudulent filings. Intuit, the company behind TurboTax, said it resumed filing of state returns at about 6 p.m. Eastern time Friday with increased anti-fraud measures, a day after halting the process when state agencies reported a rise in filings with stolen personal information. Most victims found out that a fraudulent tax return was submitted in their name when they received a rejection notice after filing their returns, said Intuit spokeswoman Julie Miller. Concerns: TurboTax says it temporarily stopped processing state tax returns due to an increase in fraudulent fillings. They have now begun again with enhanced security measures in place . There haven't been issues with federal returns to date because the Internal Revenue Service has implemented stronger fraud detection policies, Miller said. Intuit is working with security company Palantir to investigate the problem. So far, there has been no security breach of Intuit's systems, the company said. Instead, it believes personal information was stolen elsewhere and used to file returns on TurboTax. Miller linked the problem to recent security breaches at large companies. Just this week, Blue Cross Blue Shield insurer Anthem Inc. said hackers gained access to the Social Security numbers, names, addresses and other personal information of about 80 million people. It follows other security breaches at JPMorgan Chase and several retailers, including Home Depot and Target. 'You have a pretty rich pool of data out there in the world,' Miller said. Intuit said state tax returns already filed when the halt began on Thursday will be transmitted as soon as possible. TurboTax processed 30 million tax returns last year, Miller said. Rival H&R Block Inc., which also sells tax preparation software, did not respond to a request for comment. Another tax preparer, Liberty Tax Inc., said it is letting TurboTax customers file state returns for free at its more than 4,000 locations around the country. Jackson Hewitt Tax Service also said TurboTax customers who were unable to file their state returns could file for free through its online service.

"Aviation ministers are ‘stalling’ over controversial plans to build more runways, angry critics warned today in a new row. Status quo: Today's announcement will see see noise restrictions extended at Heathrow for three years . It came as Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin kicked into the long grass a recommendation by the Government’s ‘Airports ‘Tsar’ Sir Howard Davies for the creation of a new Independent Aviation Noise Authority - saying a decision on this would be ‘more appropriate’ after next May’s election. Instead, noise and night-flight restrictions at three of Britain’s busiest airports are to be extended by three years while ministers ponder where to build a controversial new runway. Existing restrictions at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted will continue until October 2017, he said. Campaigners said the Government’s response was ‘deeply disappointing’, and said Mr McLoughlin had sought to ‘bury’ bad news behind the excitement of today's re-shuffle, and to ‘kick the can down the road for another year’. They also expressed dismay that the Transport Secretary was ‘stalling’, and had failed to explicitly back the need for at least one extra runway in the South East of England - which Sir Howard’s Airports Commission says is needed. At close quarters: A decision over a possible third runway at Heathrow has been left hanging by today's news . The argument is over whether it should be at Heathrow, Gatwick or the increasingly unlikely ‘Boris Island’ plan for the Thames Estuary. But the Commission’s final recommendation on this matter will be left for the winner of next May’s general election to implement – or not. Announcing the Government’s response to the Airports Commission’s interim report published back in December, Mr McLoughlin told Parliament in a written statement: . ‘In relation to the commission’s recommendation for an Independent Aviation Noise Authority, the government believes that it would be more appropriate to consider the role for such a body alongside the commission’s final recommendations on long term capacity.‘ . Instead he said: . ‘The government is confirming today that we will be maintaining the existing restrictions on night flights at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports for a further three years until October 2017, as well as extending the ban on rare movements made by older, noisier types of aircraft.’ Mr McLoughlin said this decision ‘will help give certainty around the night noise environment for those living near the airports, as well as ensuring that operational capacity at these airports is not affected pending decisions on any new airport capacity in light of the commission’s final report.‘ . With an eye to the rows that noise has caused in the past, he said: ‘The government is conscious of the potential concerns of those living near the sites that have been shortlisted for future runway development. However, the government is also mindful that introducing inappropriate measures too early has the potential to increase uncertainty and create other negative outcomes.‘ . In the frame: London airports Gatwick and Stansted have also been considered as options for new runways . Decisions on trials of using departure runways for early morning ‘schedule smoothing’ at Heathrow should also be considered later, and ‘in the context of the commission’s recommendations on long term capacity’, he said. Mr McLoughlin added that the Government has been working with the promoters of the shortlisted runway schemes to determine when ‘blight’ measures might be put in place to address concerns and what these measures could consist of. Gavin Hayes, director of the ‘Let Britain Fly’ campaign backed by major businesses said: . ‘They are stalling. We are disappointed that the Government has failed to make any progress on the early establishment of an independent aircraft noise authority. ‘We think a new body is fundamental to ensuring that we build cross-party support for airport expansion. This should be established as soon as possible.‘ . He added: ‘Furthermore instead of bold political leadership, the Government has decided to kick the can down the road for another year. ‘We so desperately need a clear direction of travel and an in-principle commitment to build additional runways to boost our international connectivity and secure future jobs, growth and prosperity. Instead, we have yet more political procrastination.’ Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin (left) has been accused of 'stalling' in today's announcement . Campaigners also accused the minister of trying top ‘bury’ bad news behind the re-shuffle: . ‘It is also regrettable that the Government have decided to release a statement on an issue of strategic national importance on the day of the reshuffle. When Patrick McLoughlin created the Airports Commission, he rightly pointed out that 'the reality is that, since the 1960s, Britain has failed to keep pace with our international competitors in addressing long term aviation capacity and connectivity needs', and emphasised the urgent need to put that right. 'Sadly, the only consequence of today's statement is that the UK will drop still further off the pace.’ Baroness Valentine, chief executive of business leaders' group London First, said: . ‘After seven months of waiting, the Government has failed to rise to the challenge set by the commission in its interim report’. She added: ‘It will be over a decade before we have a new runway serving London, if we're lucky, and this was a great chance to hear how the Government will make best use of the airports we have to boost our global reach. ‘Instead we have no short-term plans to make the rail link to Stansted world-class, and no plans to attract airlines and passengers to grow our global air links.’ Lady Valentine continued: ‘There is no detail about an independent aviation noise authority, to bring new levels of trust around airports that more flights will mean less noise, and no certainty over proposals to cut flight delays at Heathrow.’ Mr Mcloughlin said the Senior Delivery Group (SDG), whose first report is also published today, was setting pit plans expected to deliver annual benefits of more than £150million to the aviation industry and environment by 2020, and more than £2billion worth of cumulative benefits by 2030. Mr McLoughlin said: ‘We are taking steps now to make the best use of what we already have, and looking at what more can be done in the short to medium term while the Airports Commission prepares its recommendations on the best options in the long run. ‘As we have said before, it will be for the government of the day to respond to the commission's recommendations once it publishes its final report in summer 2015.’ The Government set up the Airports Commission in September 2012 to advise on the need for, and the location of, future runways. The Commission will decide in the autumn whether or not to shortlist an estuary option, before launching a  formal consultation on the final shortlisted options ahead of its final recommendations in summer 2015.","New government announcement fails to rule on new airport in south-east .

"An Enfield property has a surprising link to Henry VIII, played in the BBC series Wolf Hall by Damian Lewis, pictured . The Tudor Room inside Little Park has played host to more than its fair share of royal history, and was the place where Henry VIII’s children – Elizabeth, Mary and Edward – were summoned to be told that the King was dead. Each of them went on to rule England as Elizabeth I, Edward VI and Mary. And in the 1920s, Mary’s namesake – our current Queen’s grandmother – was also a regular visitor to the house and Tudor Room: in her case to discuss antiques with the Leggatt brothers, the art and antiques dealers who owned the house until the 1950s. Bizarrely, the room has not always been on its present site – tacked on to Little Park, which is a delightful six-bedroom house in an acre of tranquil grounds with a tennis court, an Edwardian snooker room, outdoor pool and gym, all tucked away in a conservation area a short walk from the bustle of Enfield town centre in suburban North London. Where the room stood originally remains a mystery, but historians believe it was once part of Elsyng, a 14th Century manor house nearby, which Henry had appropriated from its owner in 1539. And after Elsyng, the room was moved to Enfield Manor House, which came to be known as Enfield Palace and on whose site now stands the town’s department store, Pearsons. Scroll down for video . Rich heritage: The Tudor Room in Little Park was where Henry VIII’s children – Elizabeth, Mary and Edward – were summoned to be told that the King was dead . It is believed it was Elizabeth, who was gifted Elsyng and the manor house, who moved the spectacular Tudor relics, dark wood-panelled walls, elaborate fireplaces and friezes from Elsyng to the manor house, which, in 1918, the Leggatt brothers bought and tried in vain to sell to the National Trust, before it was bought by the department store. To preserve the ancient treasures – which include a stained-glass window featuring Philip II of Spain, Queen Mary’s husband – in 1928 the Leggatts moved the room once more, to Little Park, which has been owned for the past 12 years by Adrian and Anne Birchall, who are now selling for £2.8 million. ‘The original part of the house was built in 1530, but the facade is Edwardian and it was then that the snooker room was built,’ says Adrian, a former chairman of Mediavest, one of the biggest advertising buying agencies in the world. Delightful: The six-bedroom house   is a short walk from the bustle of Enfield town centre in suburban North London and is now on sale for £2.8million . Spacious: The house is in an acre of tranquil grounds with a tennis court, an Edwardian snooker room, outdoor pool and gym. Pictured, the garden with its weathervale . A stone plaque records Queen Mary’s visits to the Leggatt brothers in the 1920s – she was cataloguing all the Royal possessions. For all its historic treasures and connections, Little Park today has all the trappings a modern family would need. The kitchen/morning room, with its conservatory, is a vast, light room with wonderful views of the walled back garden. Price £2.8 million . Location Enfield, North London . Bedrooms Six . Unique features . Historic Tudor Room (that has been moved TWICE), snooker room, outdoor swimming pool, gym, tennis court . Four of the bedrooms are en suite, there is plenty of off-street parking, and the whole house, which is immaculately decorated and maintained, is virtually invisible from the outside world. The gardens are a particular feature, and include a historic treasure: the weathervane from Theobalds House, the country seat of King James I, which was demolished in 1650. ‘You can sit in the garden on a nice day and you could be anywhere,’ says Anne, a pharmacist. ‘You don’t even hear traffic.’ Nick Staton, whose estate agency is selling Little Park, says: ‘When I first went inside the house, I was blown away. This will appeal to a traditional buyer who wants a Rembrandt rather than a Picasso.’ The couple, who have recently become grandparents, are downsizing but plan to stay in the area to be close to their daughter.

"At least 17 men from a small town in southern France have reportedly joined Al-Qaeda or Islamic State to fight in Syria. Three of the men from Lunel, which has a population of just 27,500, have even taken their wives or girlfriends with them. One of them even gave birth in the war zone. Six men from the town have died, which accounts for 10 per cent of the French jihadists killed in the conflict, Adam Sage wrote in the Times. Sleepy town: At least 17 men from the town of Lunel in southern France have reportedly travelled to fight in Syria . Fatalities: The six men from Lanel who have died fighting alongside IS (pictured) and Al-Qaeda in Syria account for 10 per cent of French jihadists to die in the conflict . Five people were arrested during anti-terror raids in the Abrivado neighbourhood only last month, according to France 24. The French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said the people arrested - aged between 26 and 44 - were 'suspected of active involvement in a jihadist network'. He also claimed the network's members 'were recruited and indoctrinated, and who also indoctrinated and recruited several other French youngsters from Lunel'. The town's mayor Claude Arnaud had previously doubted the existence of such a network and suspected the men were 'self-radicalised' by online propaganda. Herault regional police office estimated as many as 50 young people had travelled to Iraq and Syria from the Languedoc-Roussillon in which Lunel lies. Local officials including Mayor Arnaud are struggling to understand why their quiet town has become a source of radicalisation. It is worrying for country in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo massacre  in January and the hostage situation at a kosher supermarket that followed. Lunel's jihadists allegedly attend a Mosque in the town's suburbs, which the government has described as a 'hotbed of fundamentalism'. The Mosque is split between the more fanatically religious followers and opponents of the resident imam, who preaches in Arabic. A local man who prays at the Mosque said: 'I told him to his face that we couldn't understand a word he said, and that we wanted a French imam. He told us that, in that case, we should pray in a room outside the Mosque.' Some of the worshippers allegedly meet to discuss the suffering caused by the Syrian civil war  and encourage people to go there. A local councillor Philippe Moissonnier said: 'These groups operate like a sect... And sects manipulate people. Once you're out there, it's easy to get you to take up arms. They turn sheep into lions.' 'Hotdbed of fundamentalism': Five people were arrested during anti-terror raids in the Abrivado neighbourhood (pictured) only last month . Extremists: The French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said the people arrested in the Abrivado neighbourhood (pictured) were 'suspected of active involvement in a jihadist network' Once they are radicalised, they return to the now notorious Abrivados estate to coax other youngsters to join them. The neighbourhood has produced many extremists who have gone on to fight in Syria, including two who were killed in a bomb attack last year. The rise to fanaticism for one of the deceased fighters, Karim, was especially quick. His neighbour said: 'He never seemed particularly religious when he was younger and used go out to nightclubs, like all the kids around here when they've got a bit of money. 'He opened a cafe, but dropped everything a couple of years ago when he found religion. The next thing I heard he was in Turkey and was heading for Syria.' Another councillor in Lunel , Taher Akermi, said he knew most of the six men who died fighting alongside jihadists in Syria. The distraught man said: 'This has been my work for 25 years and I feel this as a failure What am I doing here?'","17 men from town of Lunel have joined Al-Qaeda or Islamic State in Syria .

"Alex Comley fell ill during a family holiday to the Sonesta Beach Resort in Egypt . A holidaymaker has launched legal action after his family getaway to Egypt turned into a nightmare when he contracted salmonella. What's more, when he returned to the UK, Alex Comley's illness was allegedly deemed so severe he was unable to return to work as a pilot for EasyJet. Comley, 33, from Bracknell, Berks, booked a 10-day break to Sonesta Beach Resort in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt in July with tour operator Thomson Holidays with his wife Louise, 36, and two-year-old son Sebastian. However, the all-inclusive trip, which cost nearly £2,000, was ruined only four days after they arrived when Alex was struck down by the bug at their four-star resort. He claims his illness became so serious that after returning home he needed medical treatment and was unable to return to work  for EasyJet for more than a month. He said: 'We were all very excited about the trip abroad as it was the first family holiday since my son Sebastian was born. 'We had planned on doing so many 'firsts' and really wanted Sebastian to have a wonderful time on his holiday and enjoy spending some real quality time together as a family. However the holiday turned into a nightmare.' On the fourth day he woke up with crippling stomach pains and was in agony for the rest of the holiday, suffering with vomiting and diarrhoea. 'I have never been so unwell. I couldn't be away from the toilet for any extended periods as I was so ill so I was basically trapped in a hotel room for nearly the entire time. 'I had only eaten in the hotel as it was an all-inclusive holiday, so I must have eaten something there to cause the problems.' The Sonesta Beach Resort in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt is a four-star resort, but Alex Comley believes his holiday there caused him severe illness . An appointment with the doctor on his return home apparently confirmed that he had contracted a serious strain of salmonella food poisoning and couldn't return to his job for more than four weeks. Alex, who says he hasn't received an apology from the firm, has instructed law firm Slater & Gordon to launch a legal case against Thomson Holidays. Richard Duxbury, a specialist travel lawyer from Slater & Gordon, representing the Comleys, said 'This was meant to be a relaxing family getaway but instead the holiday was ruined when Mr Comley was left extremely ill due to what we believe was entirely avoidable poor hygiene at the resort. Mr Comley alleges that he contracted his illness after eating food in the hotel restaurant . 'The restaurant for the guests was clearly not of an acceptable standard which ultimately resulted in Mr Comley becoming very ill. 'The salmonella not only ruined the holiday but has already left him unable to work due to persistent tingling, pins and needles to his hands and feet.' In a statement, Thomson Holidays said: 'We are sorry to hear of Mr Comley's experience during his trip to Egypt. As this case is now subject to legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment further. 'The ultimate priority for Thomson is the health, safety and comfort of all our customers. We operate stringent health and hygiene procedures in line with industry standards.' MailOnline Travel have contacted Sonesta Hotels and are awaiting a comment.","Alex Comley booked a 10-day stay at Sonesta Beach Resort with family .

"The astonishing demands placed on Britain's biggest primary school by the surge in immigration will be laid bare this week. A fly-on-the-wall television documentary reveals that in 1997 at Gascoigne Primary School in Barking, East London, 90 per cent of pupils spoke English as their first language. That figure has now fallen to ten per cent. More than 60 different languages are spoken by the youngsters, according to the four-part series. The documentary shows foreign children struggling to cope because they do not speak English, while teachers and even other pupils devote time during lessons to helping them. More than 60 different languages are spoken by the youngsters at Gascoigne Primary School in London . In one scene, a ten-year-old from Bulgaria cannot answer a question about how old he is. In another, a seven-year-old boy from Portugal who arrives speaking no English has to sit with other Portuguese-speaking pupils who act as translators. The number of pupils aged between five and 11 at the sprawling site has jumped from 700 to more than 1,100 since head teacher Bob Garton arrived eight years ago. There is a massive turnover of children, with about ten leaving each week to be replaced by newcomers. About 300 boys and girls a year arrive during term-time rather than at the start of the year – five times more than the national average. More than a third of new arrivals at Gascoigne speak no English and others do not have it as their main language at home. A fly-on-the-wall television documentary has revealed that in 1997, 90 per cent of pupils spoke English as their first language, pictured is a school photo from the 1970s . Critics warn that the focus put on non-English speakers 'must have an impact' on the education of English speakers. Education expert Professor Alan Smithers, who grew up in the Barking and Dagenham area, said: 'The growing gap between white working-class pupils and those from more prosperous backgrounds, which is of great concern to the Government, won't be narrowed if foreign-born pupils dominate an increasing number of our primary schools.' Prof Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, added: 'I wonder if this massive school with a huge turnover and non-English speakers is giving children the start I was able to enjoy in my relatively small, working-class primary?' In the Channel 5 documentary, Britain's Biggest Primary School, which starts on Thursday, a bewildered boy, Edson, is shown being introduced to his new class. The teacher says: 'Edson is from Portugal. Hands up who started at this school and did not speak English when they came first?' Of about 20 pupils shown, the majority raise their hands. The teacher then tells Edson to sit with a group of girls, explaining: 'They all speak Portuguese, so you're going to sit beside Luenna today. Is that OK?' More than a third of new arrivals at Gascoigne Primary (pictured) in Barking, East London, speak no English . In another scene, Viktor from Bulgaria is asked by the programme makers: 'How old are you?' He says: 'Erm…' Again asked his age, he says: 'Erm… I'm…' Both boys are shown later in the series having significantly improved their grasp of the language with help from English as an additional language (EAL) teachers and support assistants. Mr Garton tells the documentary team there is 'a sort of three-way split of backgrounds' throughout the school – a third are Eastern European, mainly Albanian-Kosovan, a third are of African origin, and a third are from the Indian subcontinent, with a 'tiny percentage' of white British children. Some parents speak warmly of the school and maintain the language barriers present no problems for their children's education. Sarah Mallia, who is British-born but married to an Albanian, says her daughter Melissa, five, speaks English and Albanian. 'When they have had children arriving who don't speak any English, I know Melissa has taken them under her wing and helped them settle in,' she says. Afsheen Amir says her daughter Abia, six, loves the school. 'There are a lot of languages spoken, but the teachers and the other children seem to cope very well with that.' The school has been rated 'good' by education watchdog Ofsted. However, its results in national tests for 11-year-olds are below the national average. The school had no comment.","More than 60 languages are spoken at Britain's biggest primary school .

"Firefighters in Northern California rescued a horse that got stuck in an outdoor bathtub Wednesday. The horse was dancing around in her stall, protecting her food trough, when she suddenly fell in around 9.30am Wednesday,  Michelle Eidam, Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District captain, said. Her food trough is a bathtub. Phantom: Here, Phantom, a  Palomino/Appaloosa mix struggles in an outdoor bathtub as authorities work to pull her to her feet . The 30-year-old horse, named Phantom, was stuck in the bathtub for about 25 minutes with her legs up in the air. Her owner saw the horse fall into the bathtub and immediately called her husband for help, the Centre Daily Times reports. Her husband, Charles Campbell, instructed her to call the fire district. 'The 911 operator got a little confused,' Campbell told FOX, 'she called [my wife] back and she says 'your husband can't get out of the bathtub? And [my wife] says 'no it's my horse.'' Distracted: Campbell said that the horse became distracted and fell, as she danced in her stall, while checking out a potential mate .

"A Coast Guard who shot dead a female fellow officer and severely wounded her wife had become obsessed with his lesbian colleague, friends claim. Adrian Loya, 31, traveled from Virgina before shooting dead Lisa Trubnikova and hospitalizing Anna Trubnikova when he opened fire at their Cape Cod condo on Thursday morning, police said. He then lit a car on fire, planted fake bombs and shot and wounded a police officer, according to law enforcement. When police told relatives of the incident, their immediate reaction was that Loya had been 'fixated' on Lisa since working with the couple in Alaska. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tragic: Lisa Trubnikova, 31, (left) has died and her wife Anna, 30, (right) is severely wounded after their former colleague Adrian Loya allegedly shot them in their Cape Cod home. He was 'obsessed' with Lisa, family say . In love: The Trubnikovas both worked in Bourne, Massachusetts, after marrying in 2013 in New York . Ambush: Massachusetts police say Adrian Loya, 31 (center), traveled from Virigina to shoot his two former colleagues at their condo in Bourne,  before opening fire during a police ambush, hitting one officer . 'He became obsessed,' a family member told the Boston Globe. 'He was fixated on her.' Lisa and Anna, who married two years ago in New York, were stationed at different bases in Bourne, Massachusetts, and worked together with Loya in Alaska several years ago, family told the Globe. Lisa was a Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class of Coast Guard Base Cape Cod, and Anna is a Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class of Coast Guard Sector Southeastern New England. Anna and the third victim, Bourne Police Officer Jared MacDonald, who was wounded responding to the attack, remain in hospital. According to Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe, the attack appeared to be calculated. Loya checked into a hotel near the couple's residence two days before the shooting. 'I think there was a significant amount of planning involved,' O'Keefe said. 'He wasn't crazy,' said Lisa older brother Luis Berlanga. 'He knew what he was doing.' Apprehended: Coast Guardsman Adrian Loya ,of Chesapeake, Va, (right) stands in the glass enclosed defendant's area in District Court on Thursday, February 5, 2015, in Falmouth, Massachusetts, during an arraignment on charges he killed one woman, injured another and shot a police officer in Bourne before dawn . The incident began about 2.15am amid reports of a vehicle on fire, but it quickly escalated into a 'crazy and hectic' scene, Bourne police Chief Dennis Woodside said. Police say Loya set fire to the vehicle to block the only road into the condo complex, and that he also set up devices resembling bombs, authorities said. Officers made their way around the burning vehicle on foot but were pinned down by gunfire, O'Keefe said. One officer was shot in the back below his bulletproof vest during the ambush. He took cover between two vehicles, but his fellow officers were unable to reach him. Woodside described the officer as a veteran with at least 10 years of service. After a half-hour standoff, Loya finally gave himself in to police and was arrested about 2.45am. Even then, police remained wary, because they were not aware if there were other gunmen. Inside the complex, the surviving female victim had called 911. Police entered the condo and found the other victim dead. The state police bomb squad examined the devices and determined they were all fakes that contained no explosives, Massachusetts State Police spokesman David Procopio said. Scene: A burned car that Loya allegedly used as a distraction is towed from the scene on Thursday morning . 'Crazy and hectic': Police vehicles line a road leading to a Cape Cod condo community about 2.15am Thursday . According to CBS Boston, Loya drove from his base in Chesapeake, Virginia, to Bourne on Tuesday and checked into a local hotel. He then left the hotel about 2am Thursday and drove to the Cape Cod complex, where he burst into the victims' condo and started shooting. He was armed with two rifles and a handgun, CBS reported. Loya reportedly had a previous relationship with one of the victims. Loya pleaded not guilty to charges including murder, armed assault, home invasion and assault and battery of a police officer on Thursday afternoon during an arraignment in Falmouth District Court. A judge ordered Loya to be held without bail and to undergo a mental health examination, and also ordered the file sealed. Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe and Loya's attorney, J. Drew Segadelli, didn't discuss details of the case during the court hearing. Afterward, Segadelli said Loya and the two women had some type of relationship but said he couldn't comment further because the file was sealed. Behind bars: Adrian Loya pleaded not guilty to charges including murder, armed assault, home invasion and assault and battery of a police officer on Thursday afternoon during an arraignment in Falmouth District Court . Investigation: Police said the bomb squad responded to examine items suspected of being hoax devices found there, allegedly placed by the shooting suspect, who was taken into custody . The wounded officer was carried through the woods and snow by colleagues so he could be taken to the hospital, where he was stabilized and improving, the chief said. Residents were at first told to stay inside their units, but Woodside later said the area was safe. He did not disclose any other details or a motive, and it was unclear when the suspect would be arraigned. The Coast Guard was helping in the investigation. 'Today the Coast Guard family suffered a tragic loss,' Coast Guard Rear Adm. Linda Fagan said in a statement. 'We have chaplains and counselors on site to support friends and families affected by this crime. 'My thoughts and prayers are with everyone who has been touched by today's sad event.'","Lisa Trubnikova, 31, and wife Anna, 30, were shot at Cape Cod home .

"British ISIS hostage John Cantlie has appeared in another video released by the extremist group in their latest piece of propaganda against the West. The photojournalist, who went missing last year while working in Syria, sits at a table dressed in an orange jumpsuit in the video titled: 'Lend Me Your Ears, Messages from the British detainee John Cantlie, episode five'. Staring solemnly at the camera, Mr Cantlie describes himself as 'the British citizen abandoned by my government and a prisoner of the Islamic State for nearly two years'. Scroll down for video . John Cantlie has appeared in a fifth video message from ISIS jihadis in which he describes how captives were treated when taken hostage by terrorists last year . Reciting 'emails' he claims were written by the families of American hostages Mr Cantlie says nothing was done to secure their release by US governments . Describing the 'second phase' of the terrorists' agenda to kidnap western journalists, he says he and his fellow prisoners 'were treated well' by ISIS jihadis before some were murdered and others released. 'Now unless we tried something stupid like escaping or doing something we shouldn't, we were treated well by the Islamic State. 'Some of us who tried to escape were water-boarded by our captain as Muslim prisoners are water-boarded by their American captors. 'We read books, played recreational games and gave lectures on our specialist subjects. It wasn't a bad life.' Unlike other videos, a small stack of papers and a pen lie in front of him on the table. They are, he claims, emails between the families of American hostages and the US government. Reciting the alleged words of relatives of journalists taken hostage by IS, Mr Cantlie says that no help was given to families communicating with ISIS by US representatives. Emotionless, he describes how other European hostages were released after negotiations were successfully carried out by French, German and Danish governments. Reading from pieces of paper Mr Cantlie alleges that US governments did nothing to secure the safe return of hostages . The video is the fifth in a series, described by the hostage as 'programmes' in which he describes life under ISIS rule . 'But it was clear something was different with the British and Americans,' he says. 'While there was dialogue for everyone else, the British and the Americans were stone- walled - it was completely silent. Nothing.' As the footage continues, Mr Cantlie talks of how the hostages did not give up hope of being saved by Western intervention. And in a potential nod to his unimaginable bravery, or, a cruel taunt by jihadis written into his script, he says: 'The human mind has an incredibly tough capacity for self-defence in difficult situations.' The fifth video comes after his sister said earlier this week she thinks he believes 'two-thirds' of what he says on camera. In September, U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff (right) was killed by ISIS in a gruesome video that depicted his beheading. His murder came just weeks after another American reporter, James Foley (left), was killed . Jessica Cantlie made an emotional appeal for her brother's return, pleading with the terrorists to reopen lines of contact to secure his safe journey home. Just two days ago, Mr Cantlie's father died following a public appeal from his hospital bed. Paul Cantlie, 80, spoke directly to ISIS extremists in a heartfelt video, pleading for his son's return. His grieving family revealed they did not know whether Mr Cantlie's captors had received the messages, or whether he had even been informed of his father's death. In September, U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff was killed by ISIS in a gruesome video that depicted his beheading. His murder came just weeks after another American reporter, James Foley, was killed. British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning have also been beheaded by the terror group. 'Hello, I'm John Cantlie, the British citizen abandoned by my own government and a prisoner of the Islamic State for nearly two years. 'In this programme I'm going to reveal to you some uncomfortable truths that have so far resulted in the executions of my former cellmates. 'Only the British and American prisoners were left behind after months of negotiations saw 16 other citizens from six European countries go home. 'How was this allowed to happen? 'We have to go back to 2013 when the Islamic State launched a long term operation to capture westerners entering Syria and they began the next phase of the operation - negotiating for our release with our governments through family and friends. 'Now unless we tried something stupid like escaping or doing something we shouldn't, we were treated well by the Islamic State. Some of us who tried to escape were water-boarded by our captors as Muslim prisoners are water-boarded by their American captors. 'Our strange little community of prisoners had its share of problems but apart from the odd fight we lived together in relative harmony through uncertain times. 'We read books, played recreational games and gave lectures on our specialist subjects. It wasn't a bad life. 'The first to leave was my friend, Spanish journalist Marcos Margineres (sic) in Feb 2014. The Mujahadeen then made their first strong move by shooting one of our number -  a Russian with no clear origin or story behind him. 'The message was clear: don't mess around when it comes to negotiations. 'The Europeans fell into line, two more Spanish journalists left, then four French, their representatives having fulfilled the conditions for their release . 'But it was clear something was different for the British and Americans. While there was dialogue for everyone else the British and Americans were stone walled - it was completely silent. Nothing.' 'Now we knew our countries claimed to be non-negotiating when it came to situations like this but also knew examples when they had negotiated either under the table or through a third party. 'Due to the size and complexity of the situation, and the number of other countries involved . 'We believed our governments would get us out in the end. So we waited patiently while everyone else went home to their loved ones. 'Finally we had movement in May. We made a video, wrote letters and made a voice recording. For us the Islamic State were asking for the release of Muslim prisoners and their transfer to the Caliphate. 'It sounded very complicated but we were the biggest group from the biggest countries (so) there had to be a negotiation going on. 'But by the time the other two Europeans left, my friend Dan from Denmark, another non-negotiating country, and Tony from Germany, it was clear to us we were in very big trouble. 'Now I have here a selection of emails between the Islamic State and families back home. 'I don't have much on the British so I assume there was even less discussion going on for them. So this is really all about the Americans and you'll see that really the government was doing nothing, absolutely noting, to help the families involved. 'I have a message here from one of the American prisoners on 11 June: ""I would secure your sister's release, if I could. It sounds like you care about her freedom. ""You have surely seen the news, our government is a mess, they will not help."" Another here, from the family of one of the American prisoners on July 17 2014: 'Our government is not being helpful. We have begged them so many times already. Everyone has buried their heads in the sand, we feel we are caught in the middle between you and the US government and we are being punished. 'We have reached out to our government but they have been non-responsive for some time now. 'We don't expect to get any help from our government at all and we feel foolish for believing them."" Another on the 24 July says: ""We are contacting people every day, you have given us a huge mountain to climb and we feel like a pawn in this political battle that we have been forced into. ""I am taking everything you have said seriously, and am working as fast as I can. I need more time."" 'Now, the recurring element in these emails is the government, the US government was simply doing absolutely nothing, to help the families involved in this negotiation. 'The Mujaheddin told us our government didn't care about us and we didn't believe them. They told us we were worthless and we didn't believe them. 'We were told we'd start to die and we didn't believe that either. The human mind has an incredibly tough capacity for self-defence in difficult situations. 'But It was all true. Our governments had chosen not to negotiate with the Islamic State through our families and friends. And while everyone else had fulfilled conditions for release, for us there was no deal. 'Join me in the next programme as we learn about a failed rescue to try to get us out, and you'll hear about how one soldier was worth five prisoners and we were worth none.'

"Ed Miliband's political turmoil intensified yesterday after Labour admitted it had been forced to stop using David Cameron as a ‘scare tactic’ in Scotland – because the Prime Minister is more popular with voters than Mr Miliband. Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy admitted that the party had ditched its mantra of ‘Vote SNP – get Cameron’ in favour of ‘Vote SNP – get Tory’, after strategists vetoed plans to portray the Election as a straight fight between Mr Miliband and Mr Cameron. Mr Murphy said: ‘It’s the same argument, but the “Vote Tory” thing has a much greater resonance. Among working-class Scots, voting Tory is associated with Mrs Thatcher, more so than David Cameron.’ Unpopularity contest: Labour leader Ed Miliband and Tory Prime Minister David Cameron . The U-turn comes barely a week after Mr Miliband insisted during a visit to Glasgow that the point of the Election was ‘Who is going to be Prime Minister, is it going to be Cameron or Miliband?’ A devastating set of polls by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft in Labour’s Scottish heartlands last week revealed Mr Cameron was considerably more popular than Mr Miliband in Scotland. In 15 out of the 16 constituencies studied, including several of Labour’s supposedly ‘safe’ seats, more voters said they were either satisfied with David Cameron or preferred him to Ed Miliband than said they would prefer the Labour leader to be Prime Minister. If the findings were repeated at the Election, Mr Miliband’s party could be wiped off Scotland’s political map, losing 35 of its 41 seats to the SNP and allowing Nicola Sturgeon’s Nationalists to play a key power-broking role in a new Left-wing Coalition. Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy (right) and Labour Leader Ed Miliband pictured in Glasgow last year . A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: ‘Most Scots prefer David Cameron to Ed Miliband as Prime Minister and it now appears that Jim Murphy agrees with them. 'His Election strategy has been laid bare – avoid all mention of his leader, drag up 40-year-old memories of Mrs Thatcher, and hope no one notices. It’s negative and weak.’ The embarrassment for Mr Miliband emerged as his health spokesman Andy Burnham appeared to be positioning with increasing confidence as the Left-wing candidate in any post-Election leadership contest. Mr Burnham lavished praise on Unite leader Len McCluskey, whose union votes will be crucial, and criticised Blairites. In particular, he distanced himself from Peter Mandelson’s infamous comment that he was ‘intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich’. Mr Burnham told The Times: ‘I don’t think any person in the Labour Party feels relaxed about the gaps in society.’ His remarks came as former Business Secretary Mr Mandelson went on to the BBC Radio 4 Today programme to deny that he had ‘sounded out’ former Home Secretary Alan Johnson last autumn about trying to topple Mr Miliband. Meanwhile, Lord Ashcroft yesterday released revised poll data that shows Nick Clegg is facing the loss of his Sheffield Hallam seat. It is the second poll in a week to indicate the Liberal Democrat leader will lose his seat to Labour. The initial poll last November put the Lib Dems narrowly ahead, but the revised results show them three points behind Labour. A second corrected poll saw figures for the seat of Thanet South, where Ukip leader Nigel Farage is standing, revised. The Tories’ five-point lead over Mr Farage has been reduced to one.","Scottish Labour have ditched the mantra after polls revealed popularity .
Poll found Cameron is more popular - even in Labour's Scottish heartlands .
In 15 out of 16 constituencies polled more voters said they were either satisfied with David Cameron or preferred him to Ed Miliband .
As a result Scottish Labour are switching mantra to 'Vote SNP - get Tory'
Hope working-class Scots will associate it with Margaret Thatcher instead .
Strategy has been labelled 'negative and weak' by Scottish Conservatives ."
"A multi-millionaire Tory backer known as 'King Prawn' has become embroiled in an embarrassing row after trying to claim a £12,000 donation to the party on expenses. Frozen food entrepreneur Iqbal Ahmed, appointed to a think tank by George Osborne after a separate donation to the Chancellor, tried to obtain the money from the British Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce. Members declared their 'shock' and refused on the grounds that the organisation is strictly non-political. And they have written to the Chancellor calling on him to investigate. Iqbal Ahmed, who has £90million fortune from Seamark - known for 'quality shrimps' - tried to claim a £12,000 donation to the Tory party on expenses . Mr Ahmed, 58, has amassed an estimated £90million fortune from Seamark – best known for the Mr Prawn line of 'quality cooked shrimps'. He has given a total of £26,000 to the Tories, made up of £12,000 to the party headquarters and £14,000 to Mr Osborne's Cheshire constituency of Tatton – where Mr Ahmed lives – between 2006 and last year. In 2007, Mr Osborne, then Shadow Chancellor, appointed Mr Ahmed to the New Enterprise Council think tank, set up to advise him on 'entrepreneurship and investment'. He has also been awarded the OBE for 'services to international trade'. The dispute centres on Mr Ahmed's expenses claims during his year as chairman of the organisation in 2011. Documents seen by The Mail on Sunday show they include claims for hotel rooms and meals, including a £252 lunch at The Ivy restaurant in London. But they also include a demand to reimburse him for a £12,000 donation to Conservative head office in 2011. The form (right) shows the £12,000 donation Mr Ahmed made to theTories. He has given a  total of £26,000 to the the party, including Mr Osborne's Cheshire constituency of Tatton . When the chamber of commerce, which represents Bangladeshi businessmen and women, refused to pay up, it received a letter from Mr Ahmed's solicitors demanding the money. The letter, sent last December, calls for the £12,000 to be 'paid without delay... by bank transfer'. The president of the chamber, Matab Chowdhury, rejected it and has written to Mr Osborne to complain, saying: 'We are shocked that Mr Ahmed is attempting to claim the £12,000 from us in expenses that he gave as a donation to the Conservative Party.' He called on Mr Osborne to 'clarify the legal status of this donation'. The claim for the Tory donation is backed by a receipt that lists 'Conservative Campaign Headquarters' as the 'payee'. The chamber of commerce rejected other expenses claims by Mr Ahmed including a £338 bill for entertaining at the Cinnamon Club curry restaurant, a £55 bill from the Lahore Kebab House and £27.55 for 'entertainment' at a Nando's restaurant. The row comes after a week in which party donors have come under intense scrutiny, with the Tories highlighting the complaints of some Labour backers that the party is 'anti-business' – while Labour has shot back that the Tories are 'bankrolled by hedge funds'. Mr Ahmed, who regularly features in Asian rich lists, arrived in Britain in the early 1970s with his brothers, Kamal and Bilal. Together they set up Iqbal Brothers to sell tropical fruit, before diversifying into frozen fish and establishing the Seamark group, whose range of products has earned Mr Ahmed his nickname in the Bangladeshi community of 'King Prawn'. Last night, a Conservative Party spokesman said: 'The donation was correctly registered from Seamark. The dispute between Mr Ahmed and the British Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce is a private matter'. A spokesman for Mr Ahmed said: 'I am not prepared to comment.' The British Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce also declined to comment.","Multi-millionaire Iqbal Ahmed made a £12,000 donation to Conservatives .
