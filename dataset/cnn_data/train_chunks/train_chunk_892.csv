"By . Gerard Couzens . Police in Spain are probing an alleged mega fraud involving millions of pounds of EU cash. Regional governors, trade unions leaders and employers’ associations are being investigated over the suspected diversion of more than £1.5 billion meant for back-to-work training schemes. Detectives in Andalucia, southern Spain, where the probe is focused, believe they may have uncovered the country’s biggest-ever fraud. Detectives in Andalucia, southern Spain, where the probe is focused, believe they may have uncovered the country's biggest-ever fraud. File picture shows a beach in Andalucia . Most of the cash at the centre of the scandal comes from Europe and is therefore part paid by British taxpayers. Andalucia, where nearly four out of every ten people are out of work, has raked in around 35 per cent of the cash aid Brussels has given Spain in recent years through European Social Fund employment training grants. The poverty-stricken region received £2.3billion from the fund between 2007 and 2013 to help its jobless back into the employment market, according to local estimates. Spain’s government contributed another £710 million. Specialist police investigators suspect millions have ended up in the bank accounts of those involved in the alleged fraud. The Andalucia region is still being rocked by an ongoing multi-million fraud scandal involving fake redundancies.

Police heading the new probe - dubbed Operation Edu - say they have detected irregularities in 15 of the 20 companies initially investigated in Malaga. A source said: 'We think it’s just the tip of the iceberg.' A firm with just two employees which doesn’t appear to have done any business at all for the past two years despite receiving more than £250,000 in training grants is among those being probed. More than 250 people including dozens of allegedly fake students who never showed up for courses they had signed up for, have already been quizzed. Opposition right-wing politicians in Andalucia are demanding explanations from the region’s left-wing PSOE party president Susana Diaz. Juan Manuel Moreno, president of the opposition PP party in Andalucia, said: 'If these allegations turn out to be true we are facing a very serious situation.'","Andalucia detectives believe they may have uncovered country's biggest-ever fraud .

"By . Chris Pleasance . and Gerard Couzens . Sam Mason, 45, the ex-wife of murdered British gold dealer Andrew Bush, called his former lover an 'evil murderous monster' adding that she can 'rot in Hell' The ex-wife of a millionaire businessman shot dead in Spain has branded his accused killer an 'evil monster' saying she should 'rot in Hell'. Andy Bush, 48, was allegedly shot dead by 23-year-old ex-girlfriend Mayka Kukucova shortly after arriving at his villa in Estapona last Saturday. His ex-wife Sam Mason, 45, attacked Kukucova in a Facebook message today, as a judge ruled Mr Bush's body must stay in Spain. Ms Mason is in the country with daughter Ellie Bush, 19, who flew over to help with repatriation arrangements. They were initially told they could bring him back within a fortnight. But they now face a painful and potentially lengthy wait after a judge made the ruling. Radio presenter Sam, who split from Bristol-based jeweller Mr Bush six years ago: 'We’re obviously devastated. 'They haven’t given us a specific reason. It’s supposed to be for several reasons but we haven’t been given any guidance whatsoever “We’ll be looking into it during the week. 'We were told we could bring him back home in two weeks time. We thought we would come back home and make some preparations and go back out and get him or meet him where he was going to be repatriated to. 'Then we had another phone call the next day saying unfortunately you can’t repatriate him now. 'We feel as if we’re in a state of total limbo.' On the same day the decision was made, Ms Mason, posted a message online which . read: 'She is an evil murderous monster and it will ALL come out at the . trial. Ms Mason (centre), Mr Bush's daughter Ellie (right) and his aunt Rachel (left) flew to Spain this week in order to bring his body back to the UK for a funeral, but have been told today that it cannot leave the country . Slovak model Mayka Kukucova (left) is accused of killing Mr Bush in a fit of jealous rage over his new relationship with 21-year-old student Maria Korotaeva (right) Kukucova is currently being held in her native Slovakia after handing herself over to police following a manhunt . 'She has taken my baby's daddy away from her forever. I hope she rots in Hell.' She added: 'Got my baby (Ellie) home at last. Next stage is bringing her daddy home. It's so complicated.' British Embassy officials were last night trying to put pressure on Spanish authorities to resolve the situation as quickly as possible. The fact Mr Bush was the victim of a crime - and his alleged killer may demand a new post-mortem after she is extradited to Spain - is thought to be part of the reason for the repatriation hold-up. The family of a British father set upon by a gang of men outside a bar in Competa near Malaga in June 2009 told late last year how they had to wait for six months for the repatriation of his body. According to Miss Korotaeva, Kukucova lay in wait at Mr Bush's Costa del Sol villa before shooting him dead as the couple arrived home . Miss Korotaeva has branded Kukucova 'madly jealous' and said the 'uneducated' model shot Mr Bush before fleeing almost 2,000 in his Hummer 4x4 . Scot Stephen Mallon’s family were told he must be preserved in case of another post-mortem and his body was placed in a mortuary in Bournemouth where they live pending a trial which has yet to take place in Malaga. Mr Mallon’s daughter Jenny, a St Andrews University student, told a paper last November: 'We never imagined he would still be there three years on.' Part-time model Miss Kukucova, is being held in custody in Slovakia after managing to flee Spain in the wake of her former lover’s death despite an international manhunt. Miss Korotaeva claims Kukucova shot Mr Bush in a jealous rage, but Slovak is reportedly pleading self-defence . Mr Bush and Miss Korotaeva had been dating for five months and had been in Spain to celebrate their anniversary . She has been accused of killing him in revenge at being dumped late last year but is reportedly claiming she acted in self-defence. A court in her homeland is expected to approve her extradition to Spain within the next month. Mr Bush’s family has painted a disturbing picture of an irrational woman whose jealous rages destroyed her relationship with the multi-millionaire jeweller. Daughter Ellie told yesterday that she would throw tantrums in his Bristol shops, check computers he had used and go through his phone.","Gold dealer Andrew Bush, 48, shot dead at Spanish villa last weekend .

"By . Gerard Couzens . This is the horrific moment two armed robbers shoot a father and son dead during a struggle on a packed bus in Ecuador. Around 20 passengers including a mother with a child carrying a balloon in his hands fled to safety as the pair ambushed their victims after they left a bank with nearly £12,000 from the sale of a van. Jose Changoluisa, 63, and his son Fernando, 33, died of gunshot wounds after being pistol-whipped by their attackers as they tried to resist. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . This horrific footage shows the moment two armed robbers shot a father and son on a packed bus . Cameras on the bus captured the violent scenes, including the moment Jose was shot twice in the back as other passengers screamed in horror and the bullets tore his T-shirt open. He collapsed and died shortly after rushing to the aid of his dying son who was dragged off the bus by the well-built robbers, still clutching onto the bag despite his injuries. A camera in the driver's cab recorded the anguishing moments Jose - his T-shirt ripped and covered in blood - climbs off the bus to tend to his dying son lying on the blood-stained cobbled street before collapsing exhausted on the pavement nearby. Shocked passers-by stopped but could do little to help as the attackers had already fled with the money . The attack happened in Amaguana, a village near the capital Quito. A post-mortem showed Jose received three bullet wounds and his son six, including four to the head. The attackers ambushed the victims who bravely tried to stop the pair from stealing nearly £12,000 from the sale of a van .

"By . Gerard Couzens . Argentina is planning on instituting a new banknote with a map of the Falkland Islands, and a folk hero who led a bloody uprising in the long-disputed territory, in a move that may enrage the British. Argentinian president Cristina Kirchner announced the move to mark the 32nd anniversary of the Falklands War with Britain, which cost the lives of nearly 1,000 soldiers. The 50 peso note will be legal currency in the next year, and will be worth around £3.75. President of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner - who announced the new currency on the 32nd anniversary of the Falklands War with Britain . The note will carry the image of the archipelago on one side, and on the other side there will be an image of controversial figure Antonio Rivero, a cowboy who led an uprising against the British in August 1833. The vigilante, nicknamed the Gaucho, went unpunished at the time because a court system had not been established. Eventually, due to never being prosecuted, he was revered as a hero in Argentina. President Kirchner has previously pledged an 'eternal fight' for the Falklands, and was described as pleased with the creation of the new banknote. Argentina have long been at odds with the British due to Falkland Islands being part of British territory, and their latest move of having an Argentinian hero and the Falkland Islands on their currency may be a move that enrages the British . A government spokesman described the new banknote's creation as 'an act of historic, social and political re-vindication of our sovereign of our sovereign rights.' After the speech at Argentina's government house, an Argentinian flag was removed to show giant mock-up of the bank note. The spokesman afterwards referred to the Falkland Islands by their Spanish name, Islas Malvinas. They then said: 'This is a homage to our Islas Malvinas and to all those who gave their lives to this cause. 'It . will compel every Argentinian to keep alive on a daily basis the flames . of love for our islands which are and always will be Argentinian.' Mrs Kirchner went on to describe the Falklands as the 'largest military and nuclear NATO base in the South Atlantic.' She then urged Britain to dedicate less time to making war and focus more time to its own population. She said: 'History shows that colonial enclaves are always recovered.' At a speech last April to mark the 31st anniversary of the war, Mrs Kirchner lambasted Britain's refusal to negotiate over the Falklands, calling them 'incomprehensible'. A Falklands referendum found that just three of the 1,517 people who voted said they were opposed to remaining a UK overseas territory.","The 50 peso note will be legal currency in six months and worth £3.75 .

"By . Gerard Couzens . A Spanish judge who absolved Sir Sean Connery of wrongdoing in an ongoing fraud probe has labelled his response to the proceedings as dilatory and ignorant of the law. Alfredo Mondeja made his stinging attack on the ageing actor in a lengthy court document explaining why he was eliminating him from his inquiry. The Marbella-based investigating magistrate has announced he will continue probing Sir Sean's wife Micheline Roquebrune over the 1999 sale of the couple's former Spanish home and an allegedly fraudulent luxury apartment complex built in its place. A Spanish judge has absolved Sir Sean Connery of wrongdoing in an ongoing fraud probe, but said he will continue probing Sir Sean's wife Micheline Roquebrune, pictured with the actor . Sir Sean and his wife bought Casa Malibu after their wedding in 1975. Before it was sold on they entertained stars including Richard Burton, Michael Caine, Omar Shariff and George Best in the magnificent whitewashed villla. Nearly 20 people including corrupt former town hall officials and Sir Sean's Spanish lawyers have already been told they will face trial. The 83-year-old Scot was told he was in the clear after denying any wrongdoing in an affidavit he made in the Bahamas. Court officials in Marbella did not receive the affidavit for more than a year and a half after Sir Sean completed it - and two and a half years after investigators sent an international 'letter of request' to the Bahamas with a list of questions for the actor and his wife. Sir Sean and his wife bought Casa Malibu, pictured, after their wedding in 1975. Before it was sold on they entertained stars including Richard Burton, Michael Caine, Omar Shariff and George Best in the magnificent whitewashed villa . Mr Mondeja, who threatened the couple with international arrest warrants late last year after failing to get them to testify as suspects over the property deal, said the delays were no fault of the court. He said: 'Although they may have harmed the progress of the case, it's also true that if the suspects had observed the proper rules of conduct, namely a minimum level of cooperation with the judicial authorities, the fate of those suspects would have been clarified more than two years ago.' Describing the delays as incomprehensible, he added: 'Perhaps it would lead one to think that the idea was to protect or hide the acts or participation of the actor's wife, something that only harmed Sir Sean himself.' Recalling reports around the time Sir Sean was first named in the probe nearly three years ago that it had cost him a lucrative publicity contract, he claimed: 'Such damage, if it existed, is largely down to the suspects' own slackness, a slackness that could even be described as showing little respect towards the work of the Spanish judicial system.' Before the Marbella villa was sold on the couple entertained stars including Richard Burton, Michael Caine, Omar Shariff and George Best in the magnificent whitewashed home. Pictured: Marbella Costa del Sol Malaga Province . Sir Sean swore his affidavit insisting he wasn't 'in any way submitting to the jurisdiction of the Spanish court or conceding the validity' of the international 'letter of request'. Mr Mondeja said it showed 'legal ignorance' and described Sir Sean's decision to wait until he and his wife were threatened with international arrest warrants to swear his affidavit as 'surprising to say the least.' He shelved his inquiry into the Scot after he denied any relationship with former corrupt mayors of Marbella and a jailed ex-town planning chief. He also said he had sold his shares in a firm linked to the suspect land deal to his wife in the 1980s.Sir Sean's wife will now continue to be investigated on suspicion of fraud and planning and tax offences. She has not at this stage been formally accused or charged with any crime. Michelle Roquebrune, Sir Sean's second wife, has previously claimed: 'These allegations of money-laundering are nonsense. 'We have nothing to do with this. We sold the property and that is it.' She is understood to have ten days to appeal the decision to continue proceedings against her.","The ageing actor has now been eliminated from the inquiry .

"By . Gerard Couzens . Police have arrested a British tourist for allegedly trying to snatch a four-year-old child outside his grandmother’s home in Lanzarote. The 25-year-old man was appearing in court today in a . closed hearing over the incident, which allegedly took place in the tourist resort . of Puerto del Carmen just after 6pm yesterday. Relatives alerted by a neighbour were said to have rushed out as the child allegedly walked off with him and held him until police arrived. Police have arrested a British man who allegedly tried to snatch a four-year-old child in the tourist resort of Puerto del Carmen, Lanzarote (pictured) The man was named last night locally as Stephen Raphael Manning. It is not known where in the UK he comes from. A police source said he was stopped by the boy’s family in the grounds of a nearby tourist complex. The source said: 'He wasn’t staying at the complex but at another hotel on the island. As far as we know he was on holiday on his own. 'He declined to be interviewed by police. Hopefully the courts will get more out of him. All lines of inquiry are being investigated. 'It appears the man under arrest has no previous convictions in Spain. We have yet to find out if he has a criminal record outside Spain.' A police source said: 'The man under arrest is a tourist. We are talking to Interpol about him to find out what we can about his background.' The boy’s family was visiting his grandmother - and had left him playing outside her home as they chatted inside. His mother ran out to confront his alleged abductor after a neighbour allegedly knocked on the door to tell her a man was carrying her child away. A spokesman for the Civil Guard in Lanzarote, which made the arrest, said: 'The man under arrest allegedly tried to take a youngster. 'We were alerted by the child’s relatives who managed to stop him. The youngster was not injured in any way. 'The suspect has been handed over to a court for further questioning.' Puerto del Carmen is Lanzarote’s most popular holiday resort and receives hundreds of thousands of British and Irish visitors every year. The family of the child at the centre of the drama is thought to be Spanish. Local reports said he had been seen near the house a day before with two or three women.

"By . Gerard Couzens . Police in the Caribbean have arrested a man accused of kidnapping a teenager and fathering eight children with her during a terrifying 12-year hostage ordeal. Maribel Altagracia Lopez spoke for the first time yesterday after escaping from the isolated house in the Dominican Republic she claims to have kept in. In echoes of the nightmares suffered by Elizabeth Fritzl in Austria and the three women kidnapped in Cleveland by Ariel Castro, she revealed how one of her children died while she was kept captive. Maribel Altagracia Lopez spoke for the first time yesterday after escaping from the isolated house in the Dominican Republic she claims to have kept in . Maribel, now 26, said her alleged kidnapper - named as Jose Altagracio Lantigua - took the youngster away from her to bury in nearby wasteland. She told Dominican Republic newspaper El Dia: 'I was in the house when my son died. 'Jose prepared the burial and took him away. 'He locked me in with my other children and buried him in land near to the house.' All eight children, aged between eight months and eleven, are said to have born at the isolated house in the municipality of Pedro Brand. Maribel said her alleged kidnapper stopped her seeing family and friends after persuading an aunt to let her go with her him so she could work as his maid. She said: 'I went with him because I thought I was going to work but he took me to a house that was being built and has always been abandoned in a community called Loma de los Cocos in Pedro Brand where he sexually abused me.' She claimed Jose forced her to hide in a locked room whenever anyone came to the house and said none of the children had ever been to school. She escaped during a row between her alleged kidnapper and a daughter he is said to have have fathered with another woman. Similarities: The case in the Caribbean has similarities to the Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro (left), who killed himself in prison last year, and Josef Fritzl, who held his daughter captive in Austria for 24 years . 'I just want to be left alone with my children, not suffer anymore and not have to return with him,' she said from the shelter where she is now living with her kids. Her alleged kidnapper, who is protesting his innocence, is currently being held on remand in prison. Elizabeth Fritzl was held captive for 24 years in the basement of her large family home in the town of Amstetten, Austria. The abuse by her dad Josef resulted in the birth of seven children and one miscarriage. Four of her children were raised by their mum in captivity and the other three were raised by Josef, now serving life imprisonment, and his wife Rosemarie in the upstairs home. Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro killed himself in prison last year after being sentenced to life plus 1,000 years for imprisoning three women in his Cleveland home for a decade while repeatedly raping and assaulting them. He fathered a girl with one of his victims.","Maribel Altagracia Lopez spoke yesterday after escaping isolated house .

Financial trader Owen Arthur Goddard, 35, was convicted on a single charge of femicide by a court in the capital Lima.

"By . Gerard Couzens . Sir Sean Connery has been questioned about links to convicted criminals as part of a court probe into the sale of his former Spanish home, it emerged today. The sale of Sir Sean's Marbella home, which was demolished to make way for luxury apartments in 1999, was probed as part of an investigation into two corrupt former mayors of Marbella jailed for crimes including embezzlement and fraud. Sir Sean was quizzed on whether he had offshore firms, had ever given gifts to Land Registry workers and what his relationship was with Jesus Gil and Julian Munoz as well as ex-town hall planning chief Juan Antonio Roca. Questions for Bond: Sir Sean was asked about his relationship with two former mayors of Marbella as well as ex-town hall planning chief Juan Antonio Roca . The uncomfortable questions were laid bare by a Spanish newspaper which today published leaked extracts of a sworn statement Sir Sean made at a lawyer’s office near his home in the Bahamas. The affidavit - in which Sir Sean denied all the claims made against him - is now in the hands of an investigating magistrate in Marbella who is probing the 1999 sale of Sir Sean’s home in the resort and its subsequent demolition to make way for a luxury apartment block built in breach of planning regulations. Nearly 20 people, including two lawyers who represented the actor in Spain and a former town hall planning chief, are facing trial on charges including bribery, fraud and tax crimes. The case has been dubbed ‘Goldfinger’ after the 1964 James Bond film Connery starred in. The investigating magistrate in charge of the pre-trial probe is set to decide Sir Sean’s fate after studying the 56-page affidavit, ordered more than three years ago. Asking questions: In the affidavit, Sir Sean was quizzed on whether he had offshore firms and what his relationship was with former mayors Jesus Gil, left, and Julian Munoz, right . Goldfingers: Juan Antonio Roca former head of Marbella planning department leaves the courthouse in Marbella, 16 May 2006 after being questioned over his role in an alleged property and corruption web . The former 007, who has not been charged or accused of any crime, is expected to react furiously to its leaking in Costa del Sol-based Spanish-language daily ‘SUR’. The respected paper printed the front page of his affidavit which included his address in the Bahamas. SUR reported Sir Sean was asked in documents if he had any relationship with corrupt former Marbella mayors Jesus Gil and Julian Munoz and jailed former town hall planning chief Juan Antonio Roca. He is said to have denied any relationship with the trio and said of Gil, a populist right-winger whose corruption turned Marbella into a haven for gangsters: ’I believe I saw him in a public engagement and don’t consider that can be defined as me knowing him.’ He also denied involvement in two firms linked to an alleged multi-million pound fraud relating to the property deal involving Sir Sean’s former home around the time it was completed, SUR reported. The newspaper said he was asked if he had profited from the operation, owned companies in offshore locations including the Isle of Man or Uruguay where cash from the suspect real estate deal is thought to have been laundered, or given gifts to Land Registry workers in Marbella. His response to all three questions was ‘No’, SUR said. Sir Sean signed the affidavit - witnessed by a Bahamas-based QC and a lawyer who has advised him on Spanish law - on February 21 2012. It was only handed to the investigating magistrate in Marbella, who is conducting his probe in secret, on January 21 this year. The reason for the delay, which prompted the magistrate to threaten the Scots actor and his wife with international arrest warrants last May before he received the affidavit, has not been made clear. Done and dusted: Sir Sean Connery's Spanish home Casa Malibu in Marbella, which was sold in 1999 . Sir Sean sold his Marbella home Casa Malibu in 1999 and it was subsequently demolished. More than 70 flats, later sold for an estimated £45million, were built in its place despite planning regulations stipulating only five flats could be built there. Connery has been alleged to have failed to pay tax on the deal. More than 20 people, including corrupt former town hall officials and Connery’s lawyers, were called to give evidence in private court hearings designed to determine if charges should be laid. Sir Sean and his wife, implicated in the probe in May 2010 following a police raid on the offices of his Spanish-based lawyers, cited health reasons for failing to attend an October 2010 summons for questioning. The court heading the Goldfinger probe - Marbella’s Investigating Court Number One - recommended last September 17 people should stand trial. State prosecutors are expected to demand jail sentences of up to 34 years for the suspects. A decision on the fate of Sir Sean and his wife, delayed while the investigating magistrate waited for a response to his international ‘letter of request’, is expected shortly. Sir Sean has already threatened reprisals over leaks linking him to the criminal investigation. In a furious letter forwarded to Ricardo Puyol by Britain’s Ambassador to Spain in October 2010, he warned he was considering legal action and demanded to know what proof court officials had to support the suspicion he may have committed any wrongdoing. Excerpts of the letter were leaked to a Spanish paper after officials questioned the British Embassy’s role in the affair. Michelle Roquebrune, Sir Sean’s second wife, has previously claimed: ‘These allegations of money-laundering are nonsense. ‘We have nothing to do with this. We sold the property and that is it.’ No-one was available today at the office of Diaz-Bastien & Truan, which has previously declined all requests for comment.","Sir Sean Connery sold Casa Malibu in Marbella in 1999 .

A spokesman for the country's top law officer confirmed it was in receipt of an International Letter of Request thought to ask for access to three 'prime suspects' - but declined to discuss its contents. The spokesman said the letter would now be forwarded to a court in the Algarve resort of Portimao tasked with investigating the newly-reopened case in Portugal. Authorities declined to give a timescale on when the letter would be sent or actioned. Scotland Yard are understood to want to question three local burglars blamed for a string of break-ins in Praia da Luz where Madeleine was snatched in May 2007. Portuguese detectives acting on a first International Letter of Request sent by Britain last July discovered the men were very close to the scene of Madeleine's disappearance and made an unusually high number of calls to each other in the hours after her abduction. Portugal's Attorney General's office announced last October the Madeleine McCann inquiry, shelved nearly six years ago, was being reopened at the request of police in Porto who have spent the past three years reviewing the case. Jose Magalhaes e Menezes, the public prosecutor in charge of the original investigation, is overseeing the reopened inquiry. He was damning of the original probe pointing the finger at Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry and claimed officers under disgraced former police chief Goncalo Amaral achieved ""very little"" during their 15 month investigation. Madeleine McCann, pictured aged three, disappeared from the Portuguese resort Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007 . Praying for news: Kate and Gerry McCann are seen posing with a computer generated image of how Maddie might have looked five years after her disappearance . Amaral has claimed in a book which is the subject of an on-going libel trial that the McCanns covered up their daughter's death in their holiday apartment. Scotland Yard detectives are conducting their own separate criminal inquiry into Madeleine's disappearance called Operation Grange. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, who is leading the Met operation, has said he continues to believe Madeleine is still alive. Operation Grange was first launched as a review in 2011 following the intervention of David Cameron in the case. A spokesman for Madeleine's parents has described the International Letter of Request as a significant development.","Portuguese Attorney General received formal request for access .

These are the five adults arrested over the motorway murders of former Miss Venezuela Monica Spear and her British-born ex-husband Thomas Berry . Police in Venezuela released the mugshots today as they revealed they were hunting four more men including one thought to be on the run with the gun used to shoot the tragic pair dead in front of their daughter . Police chief Jose Gregorio Sierralta said the discovery of Miss Spear's camera, right, at the house of the sole female detainee, left, was vital in helping them identify the gang alleged to have shot dead the former beauty queen and her ex-husband during a botched attempt to steal their car . Detectives named the alleged 'material author' of the double shooting as a 19-year-old called Jean Carlos Colina Alcala. The suspects also include a 26-year-old fugitive army deserter and career criminal nicknamed El Adolfito - 'Little Adolfo' in Spanish - who was first arrested for stealing a motorbike aged just 14. Police chief Jose Gregorio Sierralta said the discovery of Miss Spear's camera at the house of the sole female detainee was vital in helping them identify the gang alleged to have shot dead the former beauty queen and her ex-husband during a botched attempt to steal their car. He also identified the gang as the 'Bloodthirsty Ones of El Cambur' the area 200 miles west of the capital Caracas where Monday's night horror shootings occurred. The murders had been blamed by local papers on a gang called the 'Quick Ones.' Police also released mugshots of the men they are hunting - including a 21-year-old named as Nelfren Antonio Jimenez who is believed to have the murder weapon. Mr Berry, left with daughter Maya, 5, and right with Ms Spears. Their daughter is in the care . of the authorities . Orphan: Maya is being cared for by relatives and both sides of the family have agreed it is best if she lives in the US because of the rate of violence in Venezuela . The others were named as Franklin Alvarez, nicknamed 'The Stain'; Gerardo Contreras, nicknamed 'The Cat'; and a man police have yet to identify fully who is nicknamed 'The Junior One.' Mr Sierralta said: 'Jean Carlos Colina Alcala is allegedly the material author of the homicides of Miss Spear and her partner and the others under arrest collaborated directly with the commission of the crime. 'The motive of robbery has been confirmed with the discovery of a digital camera belonging to Miss Spear during a search of Eva Josefina Armas Mejias' home. Horrific: Robbers shot through the car windscreen when the terrified family locked themselves in . 'The intention was to sell the camera to another of the suspects. 'Investigators have managed the rapid identification of the authors of this crime and have been able to apprehend and desarticulate a dangerous gang dubbed the 'Bloodthirsty Ones of El Cambur.' Travel firm boss Mr Berry, 39, and . his ex-wife, 29, who became a successful actress after being crowned . Miss Venezuela in 2004, were shot dead on Monday night after puncturing . on a motorway. They were attacked as their Toyota Corolla was being loaded onto a tow truck they had stopped. They were murdered after locking themselves in their car to stop their killers stealing their vehicle. Their daughter Maya, who was shot in the leg, was told the shattering news her parents were dead after leaving hospital.

Her paternal grandparents, both British, are expected to remain in Venezuela. Retired maths professor Tom and his wife Kate moved to the south American country with their son when he was just seven. Heartbreaking: Monica Spear Mootz, 29, and Thomas Berry, 39, had an amicable split a year earlier but took vacations together with their daughter- including the one they were on when they were killed . Better times: Some friends thought that they were going to announce that they were back together after the January vacation (seen at their wedding in 2008, the same year that their daughter was born) Their daughter Katie, who now lives in Edinburgh, has flown to Venezuela to attend today's funerals for Miss Spear and her brother. The dead couple divorced last year but remained friends for the sake of their daughter.Speaking of the divorce recently to a local newspaper, Monica Spear said: 'It was a spectacular divorce. 'My friends ask me if I have suffered and they're amazed when I tell them I haven't. 'What happened is that I married a very civilised person and when we took the decision to go our separate ways we talked about the fact we had a daughter together and decided we should carry on seeing each other for the rest of our lives and it was best for our daughter that we got on well with each other. 'I want the best for him and he wants the best for me. 'I can assure you there are no problems between us.'","Thomas Berry and Monica Spear Mootz were stranded after car broke down .

"By . Gerard Couzens . and Sara Malm . A pensioner facing child rape charges who fled Britain using his elderly brother’s passport has been arrested in the Canary Islands. Frank Burgon, 76, from Hartlepool, absconded after he was released on bail on charges of rape, attempted rape and three counts of indecent assault against a child. Since his escape, he has been travelling through several countries posing as his older sibling Stanley before settling in Gran Canaria.

The new charge is not expected to delay his extradition back to Britain. A Spanish Civil Guard spokesman confirmed: ‘Frank Burgon was arrested at an apartment in the resort of Puerto Rico on Sunday. ‘He was flown to Madrid on Monday for an extradition hearing.’ Arrest: Frank Burgon was found hiding in the holiday resort of Puerto Rico on Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands after being released on bail in November 2012 . A source said: ‘He will be accused of identity theft because he was posing as his brother by using his passport. ‘He'd travelled to several countries with it and was able to get away with the ruse because of their physical similarity. ‘When we arrested Burgon, he claimed at first we'd got the wrong man and insisted he was his brother Stanley. ‘He . only admitted the truth when we warned him we'd be doing fingerprint . tests and checking him for body tattoos we'd been told he has.

Tello . faces charges of targeting children in countries across South America . and Europe - including Peru, Argentina, Chile, Ukraine and Spain, and . selling the videos he made of them across the world. He is also accused of belonging to an international sex gang. Police investigators claim he befriended his victims by using an email account where he posed as a schoolboy using the alias Maxi. He would then persuade his victims to take photos and videos in just their underwear. Tello would subsequently blackmail them into making videos of themselves naked and performing sex acts. Most . of the girls he allegedly targeted were aged six to 10.

"By . Gerard Couzens . Drug mules Melissa Reid and Michaella . McCollum Connolly suffered a dramatic setback tonight to their hopes of . an early return to Britain. The pair had been expecting to be sentenced next Tuesday after pleading guilty to drugs trafficking. But . the case took a dramatic twist last night after prosecutors said they . wanted more information from the women about the drugs gang that sent . them to Peru to pick up £1.5million of cocaine. Scroll down for video . Accused: Melissa Reid, right, and Michaella McCollum were yesterday escorted from a truck by police at Sarita Colonia prison ahead of their court appearance . Police escort: The pair were handcuffed as they were taken from Virgen de Fatima Prison on the outskirts of the capital, to a court in the city centre wearing their own clothes . Behind bars: After the pair arrived at the court, they were detained in a holding cell, surrounded by guards, as they awaited their appearance in front of a judge . Instead of being sentenced next week, the women are now expected to be asked to make new statements in court. Prosecutors . said they would be submitting a formal request on Friday to the court . for the new statements to be taken - and insisted Reid and Connoly could not benefit from a sentence reduction without their agreement. The . pair decided to plead guilty yesterday after weeks of protesting their . innocence so they could benefit from an early termination procedure . under Peruvian law - guaranteeing them an eighth off the minimum eight . year prison sentence for drugs trafficking. Court officials were still claiming today the women would be sentenced next week. Michaella McCollum and Melissa Reid looked down as they were led away from the prison by guards . Darkness: The pair were led into the back of a prison van as they prepared themselves for for the journey . But . Juan Mendoza Abarca, head of the anti-drugs state prosecutor's office . which is prosecuting the women, said: ‘What the girls have said so far . is not enough. ‘We want to . get to the men behind them and we want more information off them to do . that. It's not enough to say you've killed someone and not say how or . why. ‘All these girls have . said is “We're guilty” and very little else. They've given a four-line . statement to the court which doesn't help us track down the gang that . sent them to Peru in the first place. ‘For . the women to benefit from the early termination procedure and receive a . reduced prison sentence, all sides including state prosecutors have to . be in agreement. ‘As things . stand at the moment with the information the women have given the court, . we don't agree to them benefitting from the early termination . procedure.

Court: Melissa Reid stands up in a holding cell during her hearing .

It's not an appeal and it's not something the judge has . any control over. ‘All he has control over is the date of the new hearing. What I can say for sure is there will be no sentencing next Tuesday. ‘It's . likely now that what will take place Tuesday will be the hearing where . the women will be asked to expand on the court statements they've . already made.’ The . prosecution demand will put back the women’s hopes of starting their . jail sentences as soon as possible so they can get back to their . families in Britain.

"By . Gerard Couzens . A former Portuguese police chief blamed Madeleine McCann's parents for the three-year-old girl's disappearance to ensure detectives carried on looking for her, a former colleague claimed today. Antonio Paulo dos Santos told a Lisbon court he believed his friend Goncalo Amaral penned a book pointing the finger at the couple because he was against the shelving of the original investigation. Kate and Gerry McCann are suing Mr Amaral over his claims in his July 2008 book The Truth of the Lie that they faked their daughter's abduction to cover up her death in their holiday apartment. Trial: Kate and Gerry McCann (right) are suing former Portuguese police chief Goncalo Amaral (left) over his claims in a book that they faked their daughter's abduction to cover up her death in their holiday apartment . His book was released three days after the Portuguese police probe into the girl’s disappearance was archived and the McCanns were told their status as official suspects or arguidos was being lifted. Defence witness Mr dos Santos, who worked with Mr Amaral in the early Nineties and remains in close contact with him, spoke at the hearing this afternoon. He said: ‘Everything that's in the book appears to be in the case files. It's not fictional. They are the conclusions of a factual analysis by Goncalo Amaral as the head of the police investigation. ‘I think the main reason he wrote the book was so that the case would continue to be investigated. When he published the book I presume he didn't agree with its archiving.’ Today's libel trial hearing was the first since Portuguese authorities announced last month they were reopening their probe into Madeleine's disappearance more than five years after it was shelved. The morning court session started with a disappointment for the defence when it emerged a key witness was on honeymoon and his evidence had to be rescheduled for a later date. Publication: Mr Amaral's 2008 book was released three days after the Portuguese police probe into the girl's disappearance was archived and the McCanns were told their status as official suspects was being lifted . Criminologist and university professor Paulo Sargento was expected to support Mr Amaral and say he did not believe Madeleine had been abducted from her Algarve holiday apartment. In October 2007 he created a 3D reconstruction of the night on May 3, 2007 when Madeleine disappeared - and concluded any abductor would only have had eight minutes in which to strike. Mystery: Madeleine McCann disappeared in Portugal in May 2007 and has never been found . He later came up with a computer edit . based on witness statements of a long-haired bearded man which the . McCanns' spokesman Clarence Mitchell insisted at the time could cause . confusion. Mario Sena Lopes, . editor of Guerra & Paz which published Mr Amaral's controversial . book, admitted he could not guarantee all copies had been returned after . the McCanns successfully injected it. The . couple secured a temporary injunction in September 2008 before a court . upheld the ban in February 2010 after a challenge from Mr Amaral. The . injunction was lifted again in March 2011. Mr . Lopes, who is still Mr Amaral's literary agent, told the hearing: . ‘There are always booksellers who do not respect the orders of the . distributors.’ He also admitted knowing the book had been circulated in Brazil but insisted Guerra & Paz had nothing to do with it. Luis Vale Frois, former managing director of a firm which distributed a DVD of a documentary based on Mr Amaral's book, said it was inevitable pirate copies would find their way onto the Internet. He told the hearing: ‘If this week you release a series on TV, next week it's already on the internet with Portuguese subtitles.’ Concern: Kate and Gerry McCann claim Mr Amaral's book turned Portuguese people against them when they most needed their help in finding their daughter . Mr Amaral, removed as head of the . Madeleine McCann probe in October 2007 after criticising the British . police, attended court for the trial as he has done every day since its . start in September. Portuguese-based Cape Verdean associations have reacted angrily to reports an immigrant thief has been blamed for Madeleine McCann's disappearance and death. It emerged last week Euclides Monteiro, who died in a tractor accident in 2009, was a suspect. A spokesman for a Cape Verdean association said: ‘The representatives of Cape Verdean associations in Portugal always defend the normal workings of justice and the idea that unlawful behaviour should be punished accordingly through the proper legal channels. ‘However we denounce the fact that this immigrant cannot defend himself from these accusations in the Madeleine McCann case which could, conveniently, remove blame from other people and ease some consciences. ‘We discover history repeating itself - with yet another Cape Verdian suspect and a community which feels once again smeared.’ He has . been critical of a new British police appeal about the six-and-a-half . year-old mystery, branding it a ‘PR campaign of intoxication and . misinformation.’ But he declined to comment today on the reopened Portuguese police investigation into Madeleine's disappearance. Mr . Amaral's lawyer Vitor dos Santos insisted outside court: ‘We are not . going to make any comment about the criminal investigation. This is a . civil case and when it's over my client will be free to speak. No . lawyer should make any statements about people being absolved or not . being absolved from an investigation. 'This is not the time to be saying . anything about it because it makes no sense to do so.’ The McCanns claim Mr Amaral's book turned Portuguese people against them when they most needed their help in finding their daughter. The ex-police chief is denying defamation and insists everything in the book was contained in police files. Former police colleagues have given evidence backing his argument. The McCanns, of Rothley, Leicestershire, have applied to take the witness stand as well as Mr Amaral. Judge Maria Emilia Melo e Castro is expected to rule on their application at the end of the month. The case, scheduled to finish in December, continues.","Goncalo Amaral was said to have been 'against shelving of original probe'

"By . Gerard Couzens . and Daily Mail Reporter . Madeleine McCann’s parents are to apply under Portuguese law to become private ‘prosecutors’ in the reopened criminal inquiry into her disappearance. If Kate and Gerry McCann are granted the status of ‘assistentes’, their legal team could work alongside state prosecutors so they are kept informed of all new developments and conduct their own  private prosecution – running parallel to the state prosecution – against any future suspects. It’s a distant cry from the days in 2007 when Portuguese police labelled the couple  with ‘arguido’  – or suspect –  status. Under the country’s legal system, ‘there is a place for the victims that want to be side by side with the prosecutors’, said the McCanns’ Portuguese lawyer, Rogerio Alves. ‘They can press their own charges.’ Hopeful: Gerry and Kate McCann's fight for justice after the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine is fuelled by the hope that she is alive, their Portuguese lawyer claims . Portugal’s Attorney General confirmed . on Thursday that the probe was being reopened at the request of police . based in Porto who have spent the last two and a half years reviewing . the case. The McCanns’ Portuguese lawyer, Rogerio Alves, said local police have finally . admitted to the couple they no longer regard them as suspects, more than . five years after the original investigation was shelved. The couple were told in a police briefing last week in Lisbon, new lines of inquiry which have led to the reopening of the investigation in Portugal, absolve them of any responsibility. Mr Alves said: 'The McCanns were already informed about the reopening of the inquiry and the reasons why it was being reopened. 'They also know that this new line of inquiry excludes any responsibility of the parents. 'The Portuguese police told them this at a meeting in Lisbon last week at which British police were also present. Access all areas: The McCanns will apply for prosecutor status in the reopened criminal inquiry into Maddie's disappearance (pictured right on the day she vanished) allowing them to be kept informed of all new developments in the case . 'What it means is that the police understand there are new avenues that should be explored. 'This brings Madeleine’s parents a legitimate expectation not only that the truth will be discovered but also that it will be possible to find Madeleine alive which is the sole aim of all the efforts they’ve been making.' Portugal’s current Attorney General, Joana Marques Vidal, is the first woman ever appointed to the post. An e-fit image released by the Metropolitan Police this month of a man they want to investigate as Portuguese authorities reopen the case with new inquiries . She took over as the country’s top legal advisor in October 2012 from predecessor Fernando Pinto Monteiro after his six-year mandate came to an end. It was still unclear last night which police force would be appointed to lead the reopened inquiry. Initial reports suggested it would be a team of Algarve-based Policia Judiciaria detectives but today it appeared more likely the review team from Porto would be asked to do the job. The detectives will work under the direction of public prosecutors based in the Algarve resort of Portimao. Jose Magalhaes e Menezes, the public prosecutor in charge of the original investigation, is expected to oversee the reopened inquiry. He was damning of the original probe pointing the finger at Madeleine’s parents and claimed officers under disgraced Goncalo Amaral achieved 'very little' during their 15-month investigation. He also thwarted attempts by Mr Amaral to charge the McCanns with child abandonment, leading to a souring in relations between police and prosecutors. Mr Amaral went on to write a controversial book called ‘The Truth of the Lie’ which the McCanns are currently suing him over at an ongoing civil trial in a Lisbon court because of his claims they faked their daughter’s abduction to cover up her death in their holiday apartment. It also emerged last night Madeleine’s parents are set to apply to become private prosecutors - ‘assistentes’ under Portuguese law - in the reopened criminal inquiry. It will mean their legal team can work alongside state prosecutors so they are kept informed of all new developments and conduct their own private prosecution - running parallel to the state prosecution - against any future suspects charged over Madeleine’s disappearance. Can press their own charges: The McCanns (pictured in 2007 after Maddie's disappearance) will be able to be in court with their lawyer if they are granted prosecutor status once the secrecy order is lifted . It marks a remarkable turnaround in a case in which they were once 'arguidos' or suspects. Their status as ‘assistentes’ would be crucial because of the secrecy order slapped on the case by Portugal’s Attorney General. They wouldn’t have access to all case files at present because of the secrecy order as ‘assistentes’ - but would once the secrecy order is lifted. Mr Alves said today: 'I will be applying for the McCanns to become assistentes in this case but don’t know yet when. 'Madeleine is the victim as well as her parents who are also her legal representatives. 'According to Portuguese criminal procedural law there is a place for the victims that want to be side by side with the prosecutors. 'It’s a question of them helping the prosecutor deliver to the case files all the information they have that can assist the investigation. Disappearance: The Ocean Club resort in Praia Da Luz where Madeleine McCann disappeared from in May 2007 . 'They can submit an accusation, they can press their own charges. 'At the trial, if there is a trial, they can be in court with their own lawyer, asking their own questions. 'It’s a sort of a private accusation to help the state prosecution.” He added: 'The secrecy order that’s been placed on this case prevents me from saying what the new lines of inquiry are. 'The police asked us specifically not to compromise the investigation and we are all obliged to respect the secrecy order. 'It would be a crime for anyone working within the file with full information on the details to talk about it. We don’t have the full details, we just have an idea. 'Madeleine’s parents are the ones with most interest in abiding by the secrecy order and maintaining the efficiency of the investigation. But I can say that the information they got from the Portuguse police directly is that the new lines of investigation absolve them of any responsibility in their daughter’s disappearance.'","The McCanns' lawyer claims Portuguese police have finally admitted that the parents are no longer suspects .

"By . Wills Robinson . and Gerard Couzens . and Louise Eccles . The two British women accused of trying to smuggle £1.5million of cocaine out of Peru will receive a dramatically shorter sentence than they could have after pleading guilty yesterday. Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly admitted trying to board a flight from Lima to Spain on August 6 knowing they had 24lb of the class-A drug in their suitcases. The maximum sentence they can receive is six years and eight months - but if they had pleaded not guilty and been convicted, they could have faced as much as 15 years in a Peruvian prison. The women will be eligible for parole within three years, allowing them to return home, while it has also been suggested that they could be transferred to Britain to serve part of their sentences. Accused: Melissa Reid, right, and Michaella McCollum were yesterday escorted from a truck by police at Sarita Colonia prison ahead of their court appearance . Police escort: The pair were handcuffed as they were taken from Virgen de Fatima Prison on the outskirts of the capital, to a court in the city centre wearing their own clothes . Behind bars: After the pair arrived at the court, they were detained in a holding cell, surrounded by guards, as they awaited their appearance in front of a judge . The women, both aged 20, continue to claim that a gun-toting Colombian mafia forced them to act as drug mules. But, after police rubbished their ‘illogical’ story, they decided to plead guilty in the hope of securing shorter sentences, which will be decided next week. It also means they will not have to stand trial on drugs trafficking charges. Miss Reid, from Lenzie near Glasgow, has previously said, 'I don't want to be in jail until I'm 35,' adding: 'Pleading guilty is going to get me back to my family sooner rather than later.' Miss McCollum Connolly, from Dungannon, Northern Ireland, and Miss Reid both admitted drugs trafficking at a hearing closed to the Press. It took place at a men’s jail in Lima called Sarita Colonia. They were driven the short distance from the notorious prison Virgen de Fatima, where they are being held, to enter their pleas separately. The two women arrived at the court handcuffed and in their own clothes, Miss Reid carrying a plastic bag and Miss McCollum a bottle of water as they were surrounded by guards. They were led into a holding cell in the court room, awaiting their second appearance in front of a judge since they were arrested. Michaella McCollum and Melissa Reid looked down as they were led away from the prison by guards . Darkness: The pair were led into the back of a prison van as they prepared themselves for for the journey . Both Miss Reid and Miss McCollum stood up and spoke separately for half an hour after being asked their names. Miss Reid told the court: 'I feel very bad for the pain I have caused my family. I assume complete responsibility.' The pair also explained to the judge exactly how they carried out the smuggling plot, which they claim was planned under coercion. After the hearing they were taken back to the prison that has been their home since August 22. A . spokesman for the fourth criminal court of Callao, in charge of the . judicial investigation into the two women, confirmed: 'Both women have . pleaded guilty to drugs trafficking. 'It . means they automatically benefit from a sixth of the minimum jail . sentence of eight years and will be sentenced to six years and eight . months in prison. 'Sentencing will take place on October 1 at a new hearing.' The lawyer for Miss McCollum and Miss Reid refused to comment to reporters on the content of of the hearing. Supplies: Michaella McCollum, left, clutched onto a water bottle while Melissa Reid carried a plastic bag as they were let out of the van by police officers . Court: Melissa Reid stands up in a holding cell during her hearing . Home clothes: Melissa Reid, right, and McCollum Connolly both wore black leggings as they were escorted from a truck by police at Sarita Colonia prison in Callao, Peru . It has been reported the pair could serve their sentence in this country if Britain agrees to a transfer. Melissa’s . parents, energy company manager Billy, 54, and National Grid . administrator Debra, 53, insisted last week they still believed their . daughter was forced into carrying cocaine through Lima’s Jorge Chavez . airport. Mrs Reid said: ‘She was definitely carrying the drugs in her luggage. That’s for sure. ‘But we still believe she was coerced into it. Obviously now we realise she needs to plead guilty just to get her home.’ Miss Reid, speaking from the prison . earlier this month, said: ‘Pleading guilty is going to get me back to my . family sooner rather than later.’ But . a legal source close to the case  said a transfer could take many . years, by which time they could be free, adding: ‘It is a very long . process and Britain does not often agree to it.’ Miss . Reid's father William, 53, from Glasgow, claimed they would apply for . her to be moved to a UK prison at the earliest opportunity, saying: 'We . could start pushing for her to be transferred to Scotland.' Miss Reid and Miss McCollum Connolly will need to show they behaved well in jail, pass 'legal, social, medical and psychological tests' and can fund their own tickets back. They are currently being held in a classification unit of a women's prison which, charities have warned, has dire conditions. However, Miss Reid has compared it to a ‘Brownie camp’, and claimed to have spent a whole day helping Miss McCollum Connolly to dye her hair brown and take out her hair extensions. The prison van drives away from the prison, on the outskirts of Lima, en route to a court in the city centre . First court appearance: Michaella McCollum and Melissa Reid were told they would be imprisoned as they awaited trial when they were in front of a judge in August . Media frenzy: An enormous group of cameras and reporters were there to meet the pair as they arrived for their first court appearance earlier this summer . The women claimed they were kidnapped . in Ibiza and forced to carry the drugs by gun-toting Colombian gangsters . who threatened them and their families. In August the pair wore each other's . clothes as they appeared in court for the first time in Lima. A judge . told them they would be imprisoned as they awaited trial. The pair looked glum and drawn as they . were led away in handcuffs through the back of the court to a holding . cell. At one point, Miss Connolly wiped a tear away from her eye. They were sent to prison because . they admitted they knew there was cocaine in their suitcases and could . flee Peru if they were bailed. The women insisted they . had no idea they were carrying drugs after police stopped them as they . tried to board an Air Europa flight to Madrid and discovered more than . five kilos of cocaine disguised as food products in each of their . suitcases. There have been continued concerns over the state of their mental health, with their lawyer claiming last month that they were being held in a 'windowless cage'. During both court appearances, the pair have looked terrified. Peru’s penal authority says 1,648 . foreigners are currently in its prisons on drug trafficking charges, 31 . of them British citizens.

"By . Gerard Couzens . Kate McCann contemplated suicide after a 'smear campaign' by a Portuguese police chief who claimed she had covered up daughter Madeleine's death, a libel trial heard today. A British psychologist who counselled Mrs McCann revealed she confessed to secret 'dark thoughts' after disgraced detective Goncalo Amaral's shocking book was followed by a TV documentary based on it. Alan Pike, a trauma expert who has been helping the McCanns since Madeleine's May 3 2007 disappearance on the Algarve, told a Lisbon court: 'Kate thought about not being around anymore. Defamed? Kate McCann, pictured speaking to press outside Lisbon's civil court last week, has brought a case of libel against the former police chief in the country who she says launched a 'smear campaign' against her . 'She referred to killing herself as an option to end the trauma she was experiencing. 'I deduced it was an indicator of how she felt rather that something she ever intended to do. 'Kate in particular wasn't very well and she shared with me some very dark thoughts which she hadn't done before. 'When people are going through trauma they sometimes feel helpless and one of the things they say is, ""I wish I wasn't here"". 'One solution some people formulate is to take themselves away from it all. 'To share that with anyone will often . alarm or worry the people they live with so I think I was the only . person Kate shared this with.' Mrs McCann is being accompanied by her friend Susan Hubbard for the first hearing of the case against Mr Amaral, who published a book making allegations about Madeleine's disappearance . Mrs McCann (left) is suing the Portuguese . ex-police chief (right) for the book, titled 'Maddie: The Truth of The . Lie', which accuses her of staging her daughter's disappearance, despite . a lack of evidence . Mr . Amaral, the Portuguese policeman who led the botched hunt for . Madeleine, claimed in his bombshell 2008 book 'The Truth of the Lie' the . McCanns hid their daughter's body after she died in an accident and . faked her abduction. He also suggested the couple cashed in on £2million of public donations. Mr . Amaral's book was published in July 2008 just three days after the . McCanns - made suspects over their daughter's death in September 2007 - . had their status as 'arguidos' formally lifted. Around 120,000 copies of the book were sold before it was withdrawn when the McCanns won an injection against him. The couple, both 45, from Rothley, Leics, launched £1million libel proceedings against the former police chief, sacked as head of the Madeleine McCann investigation after he attacked British detectives. They are also suing his book publishers and a TV station which broadcast an April 2009 documentary repeating Mr Amaral's claims. Mr Pike, who has stayed in touch with . the McCanns after being called in by their tour operator Mark Warner . when Madeleine disappeared, told the court the book and documentary . caused Kate 'secondary trauma' after the 'primary trauma' of Madeleine's . disappearance. He said she . relapsed into despair at the idea people would believe the claims and . stop searching for Madeleine after she, Gerry and their twins Sean and . Amelie, now eight, made good progress on their return to Britain in . September 2007. Gerry McCann, left, has flown to Portugal to join his wife Kate in the £1million libel case they brought against former police chief Goncalo Amaral, who published a book about Maddie's disappearance . Madeleine McCann disappeared on May 3, 2007, from the family villa while they were on holiday in the Algarve, Portugal. Mother Kate McCann has campaigned tirelessly to try raise awareness to help find her daughter . 'She spent . many days in tears sobbing about the injustice being done to Madeleine . by the very people who ought to have been helping her,' Mr Pike told the . court. 'There were times when she felt so . incensed by Amaral and his friends, by which she meant his publishers, . that she simply couldn't get through each day with the panic and the . anguish she felt. 'These were things Kate told me when I spoke to her that she'd recorded in her diary in September 2008.' He added: 'I remember Kate being further devastated by the content of the film. 'The second traumatic reaction we have is sometimes more profound than the first one, more deep-seated, more entrenched and often more extreme. 'They can be more difficult reactions to deal with. When I spoke to the family about the film this is what I found. 'They were extremely angry and very disappointed and very frustrated. 'It . was broadcast on TV in Portugal and the McCanns felt there was little . or no chance of Madeleine ever being found in Portugal.' Mr . Pike, a partner at a trauma after-care centre based in Skipton, . Yorkshire, said the McCanns viewed Mr Amaral's book as a 'gross breach . of confidentiality' because it showed he had been speaking to publishers . while he and colleagues claimed laws on secrecy prevented them from . discussing the Madeleine case with the couple. Missing: Madeleine McCann vanished from a resort in the Algarve six years ago. She is believed to have been abducted from the family's holiday apartment when she was sleeping . Crime scene: The Ocean Club Resort in Praia da Luz where Madeleine went missing in 2007 . Unsolved: Kate and Gerry McCann hold a news conference to mark the 5th anniversary of the disappearance of their daughter . He added: 'The judge said there was no evidence whatsoever that Kate and Gerry had been involved in any way in Madeleine's abduction and Kate was wondering how it was possible for a police officer involved in the search to reach his conclusions and for no-one in Portugal to challenge them. 'One of the most devastating effects of the book was that the family were worried it would influence public opinion in Portugal and people they would believe the book. 'Basically if people believed what was written in the book they were concerned people in Portugal would stop looking for her. 'Even now Kate and Gerry believe the most likely chance of finding Madeleine would originate from Portugal and so the publication in their minds meant the finding of their daughter in Portugal would be diminished.' Amaral, 56, is denying defamation and insists everything he published in his book is already contained in police and court case files on Madeleine which have been made public. The case, due to finish hearing evidence in November, continues.

"By . Gerard Couzens . Two British tourists have been arrested in Portugal after allegedly hiring a firm to kidnap them during a 40th birthday party. Police raced into action after receiving a string of 999 calls about an abduction in Lisbon's Restauradores Square. Terrified callers told police they had seen masked men forcing two women into a white van. Several police vehicles were sent to the scene and began to chase the van. However, when they stopped it, the two women turned out to be thrill-seekers who had paid to be kidnapped for their birthday celebrations. Held: Two British tourists have been arrested in Lisbon, Portugal,  after allegedly hiring a firm to kidnap them during a 40th birthday party . The pair were arrested along with four Portuguese nationals - the owner of the unnamed company and three other men involved in the pretend abduction. Police have confiscated the vehicle used in the fake kidnap and a video used to film the experience. Those arrested were due to appear in court in Lisbon yesterday on suspicion of criminal simulation, a crime which carries a maximum one-year prison sentence. None of the six detainees have been named. The bizarre incident occurred around 15.30pm on Sunday at Restauradores Square in Lisbon city centre. The square is dedicated to the restoration of the independence of Portugal in 1640 after 60 years of Spanish domination. Hit: The incident is remarkably similar to the storyline in hit film The Game, starring Michael Douglas . The four men and two Brits police arrested are aged between 27 and 40.The women are thought to have flown to Portugal with a group of nine friends to celebrate their 40th birthdays. A police source said: 'The incident provoked social alarm and terrified several passers-by at the scene.' Extreme kidnapping is the latest thrill for adrenaline junkies. People can pay up to £1,000 to be abducted and tortured. Customers of French firm Ultime Realite - which is completely unconnected to this incident -  can buy a basic abduction package in which they are seized by strangers, bundled into a car bound and gagged, and kept in a dark cellar for hours. Boat chases and helicopter escapes can be added to the tailor-made experience. Customers explain what they want and once the scenario is established, they sign a contract and liability waiver, but have no idea exactly when or where their abductors will strike. The company's website promises: 'You will go through the real sensations of violence, terror and fear of a real kidnapping - a psychological shock that you won't forget in a hurry.' The incident is remarkably similar to the 1997 thriller The Game starring Michael Douglas, in which the protagonist is trapped in a real-life 'game' organised by a shadowy group called Consumer Recreation Services.

"By . Jonathan Petre . and Gerard Couzens . and Amanda Williams . Suspect: Ian John Bennett, who was detained as his father Douglas was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died of head injuries . A British tourist arrested on suspicion of killing his 69-year-old father during a fight at a Spanish holiday camp, may have been rowing with him over a spilt drink. Ian John Bennett, 45, was detained as his . father Douglas was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died of head . injuries. He was released on bail yesterday after appearing in court. Mr Bennett senior . was allegedly attacked in the early hours of Friday morning at the . Castell Montgri campsite near the town of Estartit, on the Costa Brava . north of Barcelona, where he had been staying in a mobile home with his . wife Gloria and his son, all from Chard in Somerset. The Daily Mirror reports that guests had heard shouting and loud arguing. Security officer Robert Wilson, from Sheffield, told the paper that he heard a man shouting that it was 'not his fault' and that a woman had 'split the drink on him'. Another holiday maker - who asked not to be named - said that ‘one single punch had been thrown’, and that the father had fallen and hit his head. It comes after an autopsy revealed that Mr Bennett could have died from a brain injury caused by hitting his head on the ground and not from a blow. Family . and neighbours are stunned and say the father and son had such a loving . relationship they have no idea how any fight could have occurred. Douglas’s . brother Bob, 61, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Doug and Ian were so close . it was unreal. I have no idea what could have sparked this. I’m . absolutely speechless.’ Police . were called by a campsite security guard on Friday morning. At the time . Mr Bennett senior was still alive but unconscious. He was taken to Josep Trueta Hospital in nearby Girona but failed to emerge from a coma and died shortly after being admitted. An . autopsy was due to take place yesterday to investigate suspicions that . he died from a punch to the head or possibly from a head injury . sustained while falling. According to local reports the father and son had a drunken row, which escalated into a fist fight. Douglas’s . brother Bob said the family had had its difficulties and that he and . his brother had not been in contact, but he could not imagine any reason . why Ian would physically fight with his father. He . said: ‘I nursed our mother Hilda until she died in 2011 but Doug never . helped at all. He let her down in the past and we disagreed about that. Though none of that would have had any bearing I can think of on what . has happened. ‘He was still my brother and I’m very sad to hear about his death. ‘I . don’t know whether it might be relevant or not but Ian was very ill . about 20 years ago when he had some sort of mental breakdown.’ The resort L'Estartit, Spain: Mr Bennett senior was allegedly attacked in the early hours of Friday morning at the Castell Montgri campsite near the town of Estartit, on the Costa Brava north of Barcelona .

"By . Gerard Couzens . Proud recipient: Candeleda town hall chiefs said they named a main street after Mr Major because he has put it on the map by holidaying there for nearly 25 years . Former PM John Major has unveiled a street named after him in a small Spanish town - and claimed British tourists who flock to the Costas miss out on the 'real Spain'. The ex-Conservative Party leader returned to his favourite holiday haunt of Candeleda two hours drive west of Madrid on Saturday to unveil Avenida de John Major - John Major Avenue in English. Town hall chiefs announced earlier this month they intended naming a main street after Mr Major because he has put it on the map by holidaying there for nearly 25 years. He stays at a country home near the town which friend and former Conservative Party colleague Tristan Garel-Jones’ Spanish wife inherited from her late father. In a thank you speech ahead of the unveiling ceremony, Mr Major said: 'Up to one million of my fellow British citizens have a house in Spain and somewhere between 13 and 14 million British tourists visit Spain every year, the largest number of tourists from any country by a very long way. 'Most of them come to enjoy your beautiful seaside and island resorts but I’ve learnt differently. 'I would urge them to venture into real Spain. 'They will find not only magnificent cities, part of our common European heritage, but a whole range of stunningly beautiful towns and villages of which Candeleda is to me, is one of the jewels.' The former PM, wearing a shirt and jacket despite the searing heat, was accompanied by wife Norma and ex Tory Cabinet ministers Douglas Hogg and Ian Lang. He admitted his Spanish was limited to ‘gracias’ because like most Brits he was an 'idle, lazy linguist.' Mr Garel-Jones, Minister for Europe under John Major, translated his speech into Spanish so the 300 locals and dignitaries present could understand. Mr Major said: 'In all countries political disagreements can run very deep but it’s important to remember there are some things that stand above the day-to-day political struggles. 'The town of Candeleda not only honours me but reminds us of that important principle. 'Today for me is a very special day. Candeleda is a very special place. 'My wife Norma and I look forward to coming here many times in the future.' Candeleda, a popular weekend destination for tourists from Madrid, boasts one of Spain’s highest mountains, the 8,500 Almanzor peak which Major can see from his holiday home when he stays. Peas - his favourite food in the famous Spitting Image sketch of the former PM - might not be on the menu in most of its restaurants. But it is famous for its goats cheese and roast goat kid as well as its paprika. Olmedo, where Nick Clegg holidays every summer with his Spanish wife and their three kids, is just a two-hour drive drive away in the neighbouring province of Valladolid. A monolith next to an old tobacco fermentation centre has also been named after Mr Major, who is expected to stay in the area all week. Place in the sun: Mr Major stays at a country home near the town which friend and former Conservative Party colleague Tristan Garel-Jones' Spanish wife inherited from her late father . He first visited the town in 1989 when Tristan Garel-Jones invited him to stay at his country home. He used to be flown by helicopter from Madrid’s Barajas Airport when he was holding the reins of power, but now makes the two-hour journey by car. A Spanish couple that look after the house all-year-round cook for him while he is there, making his favourite sangria and gazpacho, a cold tomato soap. His favourite pastimes include reading and trekking in the Tietar Valley south of the Gredos Mountains which draw holidaymakers to the protected area. The avenue named after John Major is an amalgamation of two streets which include the old tobacco fermentation centre and a council-run sports complex and is soon set to become the HQ of the local police. It is also the access road Mr Major uses to come into the town centre. Councillor Rodrigo Munoz, spokesman for the local Popular Party which holds eight of the 13 council seats and proposed the street-naming idea, said: 'We obviously want to promote Candeleda and see this as an excellent way of achieving this objective. 'But it’s also our way of saying thank you to Mr Major for choosing to holiday in our town when he was Prime Minister and repeating year after year. 'He obviously likes it here and we’re delighted to receive him. 'I’ve enjoyed a beer with him in the town hall square the last couple of times he’s been and he seems a very nice down-to-earth man who although he doesn’t speak Spanish can say the odd word.'","John Major has holidayed in Candeleda for nearly 25 years .

Raising a glass of champagne on a luxurious African holiday, this is the London-based banker wanted by the US over a £4billion trading scandal. Javier Martin-Artajo Rueda, 49, had apparently gone ‘missing’ while the FBI sought to question him over alleged offences by his team at banking giant JP Morgan. But while investigators sought to bring him to justice earlier this year, he and British wife Sara Berrow, 50, were apparently enjoying the high life on an extended holiday in dictator Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe. Last night, however, the authorities finally caught up with the £8million-a-year high-flier in his native Madrid. He was arrested after turning himself in at a police station and a Spanish judge will now rule on  extradition to the US, where he could face up to 25 years in jail. Major City figure Martin-Artajo is being named as the key suspect in the ‘London Whale’ trading scandal which severely damaged JP Morgan and was the latest in a series of blows to the banking industry when it emerged last year. Shares in the American lender and British banks fell after it was revealed that JP Morgan trader Bruno Iksil, nicknamed ‘the London Whale’ because of his huge spending power, had made a series of bad bets on the international markets. The Frenchman has been granted immunity from prosecution in return for assisting investigators, who this month announced that  his boss Martin-Artajo was instead suspected of covering up the mammoth loss-making deals over an extended period. The huge trading losses caused a storm in Washington, prompting a Senate investigation. But when the FBI began seeking Martin-Artajo, he was not to be found either at his £2.5million country mansion in Church Westcote near David Cameron’s home in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, or at his house in Chelsea, London. Photographs have now emerged showing the . banker and his wife in March at the five star Bumi Hills safari hotel . beside Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe. Break: The photos of Martin-Artajo's extended holiday were taken in March 2013, around the time the warrant for his arrest was issued in the U.S. Enjoying himself with boating trips and posing happily for pictures, he appeared to show little concern about the case being mounted against him in America. Along with trader Julien Grout, a Frenchman also based in London,  he faces four charges of conspiracy, wire fraud and making false filings to US regulators. Miss Berrow – who married the banker in Chelsea 12 years ago and has a nine-year-old son by him – refused to comment last night.","Javier Martin-Artajo Rueda is suspected of covering up loss-making deals .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Former soldier and teacher Jason McDermott, 45, has been given a life-time classroom ban for a history of 'recurring violence' against his pupils . A soldier-turned-teacher has been given a life-time classroom ban for punching, jabbing and pulling the hair of his pupils in a history of 'recurring violence'. Jason McDermott, 45, struck pupils . in the stomach or chest on four separate occasions - one of which left a pupil off school sick for two days. He also grabbed the hair of a student in another incident. The 45-year-old, who worked at CTC Kingshurst Academy in Solihull, West Midlands, defended his behaviour as 'boisterous play'. In his self-written profile on the school's website, it also boasts that he has 'the mentality of “What doesn’t kill you will only make you stronger” - well we live in hope!!' But after the ban was imposed, students jumped to the teacher's defence, with some saying he was 'the best teacher they'd ever had'. Ex-pupil Paige . Griffiths set up a Facebook page called 'Support for Jason . McDermott', to show her backing to the teacher. It received more than 800 'likes' in just two hours. Mr McDermott was given the ban after admitting carrying out 'inappropriate physical contact' with his pupils over a two-year period. Mr McDermott, who served with the British Army for 14 years, admitted unacceptable professional conduct when his case appeared in front of the National Council of Teaching and Leadership disciplinary panel. The hearing heard Mr McDermott, who . was first employed by the school in 1999, taught a BTEC course for . Uniformed Services at the school. It involved preparing students for potential jobs with the public services, including the fire brigade and the army. The panel heard the violent incidents happened between January 2011 and March 2013. Shortly afterwards, Mr McDermott was . suspended by the school and subsequently resigned. The first allegation came to light after he pulled the hair of a pupil in January 2011. The pupil's mother complained and her concerns were passed on to the local authority. But Mr McDermott went on to punch or jab students on 'a number of occasions', including . the four highlighted by the panel, the hearing was told. These incidents were reported to the Vice Principal of the school by another member of staff. The panel concluded there had been a 'pattern . of him engaging in inappropriate physical contact with pupils'. It said he was also guilty of bringing the profession into disrepute and had a 'deep-seated attitude that leads to harmful behaviour'. But the description of his behaviour was criticised by former students. On her Facebook campaign, Miss Griffiths . wrote: 'Everyone who knows Jason knows he's the best teacher ever to . have been at CTC. We love you Jason!' The 18-year-old said the ex-soldier . would sometimes prod students, 'jokingly punch them', and make them do . army style push up drills if they misbehaved. She . said: 'We used to do banter. It was sort of like play fighting, it was . joking around. It may have looked violent, but it wasn't like that. 'Everyone who has liked the Facebook page is in support of him. The decision to ban him is unfair.' Mr McDermott, who taught at CTC Kingshurst Academy in Solihull, West Midlands, described his behaviour as 'boisterous play' but a disciplinary panel said he was guilty of a 'pattern' of 'inappropriate physical contact' The teenager hopes her group might help Mr McDermott if he decided to appeal the ban in the future. She added: 'If he does appeal it, then all of us showing our support could help him out.' Former . pupils Keir Herbet said: 'I didn't always see eye to eye with him, but . he was a very, very good teacher. He would never hurt anyone on purpose. It was never malicious, it was always banter. 'It's been taken out of context. He could be physical but in a joking manner. He was very respectful. He is a good man.' McDermott, . who was not present or represented at the hearing, said in a statement . that physicality between staff and students had always been a part of . the relationship on the course. He said this had included ‘boisterous play between students and himself’, which involved him being 'on the end of many dead leg/arms or at the . bottom of a pile on'. But in a decision taken on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, Mr McDermott will now be banned from teaching in schools, sixth form colleges, relevant youth accommodation or children’s homes for life. He has a right of appeal to the High Court within 28 days. 'We used to do banter. It was sort of . like play fighting, it was joking around. It may have looked violent, . but it wasn't like that' Student Paige Griffiths . NCTL official Paul Heathcote concluded: 'Mr . McDermott has engaged in a pattern of inappropriate physical contact . with pupils over a period of two years. 'The . panel have decided that the public interest considerations outweigh the . interests of Mr McDermott, particularly as his behaviour involved . recurring violence against students of a potentially criminal nature. 'Mr McDermott accepts that what he did was wrong and that he regrets his actions.' According to his profile on the school's website, Mr McDermott served with the army all over the world 'in many different theatres of operation commanding, training and developing soldiers in the Infantry'. For the last nine years of service, he worked in the gym as a Physical and Adventurous Training Instructor, training new recruits at the Army Training Regiments. Mr McDermott describes how he also had the opportunity to work with the Metropolitan Police in Hendon developing its programmes of unarmed defensive training. He also worked with the Home Office to design and implement a new 'prisoner restraining methodology', as well as fitness training and assessment programmes for the London Fire Brigade. The hearing heard Mr McDermott was considered to be a person of good character with no criminal or disciplinary sanctions before the first of the allegations.","Jason McDermott, 45, had a history of 'recurring violence' against pupils .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Vandals ironically daubed graffiti on a £650,000 Banksy mural - just hours before a wealthy philanthropist paid to stop the iconic artwork being removed. The elusive artist, whose identity is a jealously-guarded secret, painted three 1950s-style spies on the side of a £300,000 semi-detached house in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, in April this year. But this week, vandals scratched a name into one of the spies' sunglasses, before messily scribbling it out. Vandals attacked one of Banksy's pieces of street art in Cheltenham by scribbling on one of the character's sunglasses - just hours before a millionaire stepped in to stop it being removed from the wall . The artwork featuring three spies, which is inspired by the town's GCHQ, . was painted on the side of a semi-detached house by the elusive artist . in April this year- and soon became the subject of an ownership war . Banksy made his name as an artist through his graffiti art, which he creates in secret, usually in public places. The vandalism came just hours before a millionaire stepped in to ensure the artwork stayed in place for the community. After the piece was created, the GCHQ-inspired artwork became the centre of an ownership war. Both the community and an art collector wanted to buy the piece from the homeowner. An art . collector offered to buy it from the homeowner and have it scraped off . the wall but the community wanted the painting to stay put . To abate the row, Cheltenham Borough Council issued a temporary notice to stop anyone undertaking any work to the listed property, which would include removing the painting. But . just hours before the notice ran out, Hekmat Kaveh stepped . in and offered the homeowner an undisclosed fee to leave the artwork in . place for the community. Mr . Kaveh said: 'Having spoken to many people over the last few weeks, and . reading many comments on social media, I have concluded that there is a . very strong feeling about this work. 'It . seems that Cheltenham generally is in support of, not only retaining . the Banksy in the town, but in its current location, where it was . clearly intended to be.' Hekmat Kaveh offered the homeowner an undisclosed sum to keep the painting in place just hours before a temporary notice put in place by Cheltenham Borough Council - which stopped anyone . doing any work to the listed building - expired . The move has been welcomed by the Save the Banksy Group, who had raised £115,000 towards buying the work. Group leader Angela de Souza said: 'I am sure the whole town extend their gratitude to Mr Kaveh for stepping in like this to prevent the loss of this artwork.' The move is still subject to receiving agreement from council planners, listed building authorities, the Highways Agency and Cheltenham Borough Council - but most have already expressed support. Speaking about the vandalism, Cheltenham’s . own street artist Dice67 - who previously put a layer of protective paint over the . work to stop the piece being defaced - said: 'It’s never nice to see someone defacing street art. 'But . at the end of the day, when you go out and paint on the street, that is . what happens sometimes. That is the nature of the game.'","The elusive artist painted a mural on side of a house in Cheltenham in April .

"By . Gerard Couzens . The Spanish mayor of a popular expat town has come under fire for posting pictures of a pretend military invasion of Gibraltar on his Facebook page. Fransisco Perez Trigueros was branded a 'fool' after using a mocked-up image of Spanish Army soldiers marching over Gibraltar's runway while fighter jets fly overhead. The image also shows a Spanish flag flying over the British territory and an Osborne bull - Spain's unofficial national symbol - halfway up the Rock. Controversy: Fransisco Perez Trigueros was branded a 'fool' after using a mocked-up image of Spanish Army soldiers marching over Gibraltar's runway while fighter jets fly overhead . Critics last night attacked the nationalist mayor of Callosa de Segura near Alicante. Gibraltarian Jonathan Manasco said: 'It is fools like this that encourage others to violence and hatred.' Ernest Romero told Trigueros to 'go to hell' on the website of a Gib-based activist group which flagged up his use of the picture. And Robert Menez, urging the right-wing mayor to stop using Gibraltar as a smokescreen to deflect attention from Spain's 4.7 million unemployed, added ironically: 'He could be taken seriously by some. 'After all, if he rounds up all the unemployed he could probably invade China.' Dispute: Simmering tension over the Rock escalated at the start of the month after Gibraltar dumped 70 concrete blocks in the sea to create an artificial reef and stop Spanish fishermen entering its waters . Trigueros, a member of the governing . Popular Party which is at loggerheads with Britain over Gibraltar, got . himself into hot water last month over an attack on nationalists living . in Spain's Catalan region. After the booing of Spain's . national anthem at the opening of the Barcelona swimming world . championships, he went on Facebook to rant: 'Lets give these s**** their . bloody independence now so they leave us be. 'But build a 30-foot-high wall so we don't have to see them again.' He later withdrew his comments and insisted he was only attacking the sort of Catalans who burnt the Spanish flag. Political rivals accused him of behaving like a fascist and called on him to resign. Anger: Spain responded by trying to choke Gibraltar with six-hour-long border queues and threatening to charge motorists £43 a time to cross the frontier . Callosa . de Segura, home to around 18,000 inhabitants, is a 30-minute drive . inland from the Costa Blanca resort of Torrevieja, nicknamed 'the Costa . del Yorkshire' by some holidaymakers. Its . stunning setting at the foot of the Callosa de Segura mountains draws . thousands of tourists to the town every summer and has attracted . hundreds of expats fleeing the more-built up Costa resorts. The town hall website can be read in eight languages including English, Romanian and Russian. Simmering . tension over the Rock escalated at the start of the month after . Gibraltar dumped 70 concrete blocks in the sea to create an artificial . reef and stop Spanish fishermen entering its waters. Spain has never recognised the three nautical miles of sea around the British territory as Gibraltar's. Spain . responded by trying to choke Gibraltar with six-hour-long border queues . and threatening to charge motorists £43 a time to cross the frontier. Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo responded by accusing Spain of acting like international pariah North Korea. An emergency phone call between Prime Minister David Cameron and his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy failed to defuse the situation. Britain is now threatening legal action against Spain. Mr Picardo was due to fly to London today for meetings with Mr Cameron and Foreign Secretary William Hague in the face of continued pressure from Spain at the border with Gibraltar. Sporadic Guardia Civil checks caused tailbacks into and out of Gibraltar at peak times over the Bank Holiday weekend.","Fransisco Perez Trigueros branded a 'fool' for putting picture on Facebook .

"By . Steph Cockroft . An ice cream van driver who lost attention 'for a few seconds' killed a motorcyclist after failing to spot him during rush-hour traffic. Mohammed Zabeur Khan, 49, was making a right turn in his Ford Transit van in Bolton in April this year when he crashed into Andrew Wood, who was travelling in the opposite direction. The court heard that Mr Wood, from Bolton, was overtaking . stationary traffic on his own side of the road when Khan pulled out . across the traffic. Mohammed Zabeur Khan, 49, pictured left, was making a right turn in his ice cream van when he crashed into motorcyclist Andrew Wood, 23, pictured right, who was travelling in the opposite direction . Khan - who was said to be 'utterly devastated' about what had happened - did not spot Mr Wood’s motorcycle approaching. The 23-year-old, who worked at an animal . sanctuary where he cared for sick and abandoned creatures, died in . hospital from his injuries. In a statement released by police, Mr . Wood's family said he had been a 'hard-working, honest and friendly . person' and they were 'completely overcome' by his death. During the hearing at Bolton Crown Court, Khan pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving. The court heard that Khan - who needed an interpreter in the proceedings - had momentarily lost attention. Mr Wood had been . travelling in the opposite direction in his own lane and on the outside . of queuing traffic, the court was told. Mohammed Nawaz, representing Khan, said the collision had been 'no more than a few seconds of momentarily in-attention'. He said: 'He was on a main road in Bolton, in rush hour traffic. He was wanting to execute a right turn, he positioned himself in the centre of the road and indicated to turn right. The crash, which took place in Bolton, pictured above, during rush-hour traffic, took place after Khan momentarily lost attention. Mr Wood died later in hospital from his injuries . 'He waited for a gap in the traffic. Once a gap appeared he began his right turn.' He added that the defendant accepted that carelessness had led to the crash, but that he had been left shattered by the outcome. He said: 'He (Khan) is a man almost in . his 50s, he drives for a living. He was driving an ice cream van at the . time. He has a clean record and no previous convictions. 'He is a family . man with children. He is utterly devastated by the consequences of the . collision.' Prosecutor Peter Cadwallder said: 'Clearly in-attention was only for a . few seconds but in light of tragic circumstances I would put it in . category two although not at the top of that.' Khan pleaded guilty at Bolton Crown Court, pictured above, to causing death by careless driving and was told it was unlikely he would be sent to prison for the crime . Judge Timothy Clayson said the defendant would be unlikely to go to jail for the killing. He said: 'Momentarily in-attention means exactly what it says. The case doesn’t easily fit in. It seems to me that it is placed at the bottom end of the second category. 'This case, if the defendant pleads guilty will not attract a prison sentence.' The case was adjourned for pre-sentence reports. Khan will be sentenced in September at the court. He was issued with an interim driving ban ahead of sentencing. In a statement released by police, Mr Wood’s family said: 'Andrew was a dedicated son, brother and uncle and will be sorely missed by his close circle of friends. 'He was a hard-working, honest and friendly person who enjoyed walking with his dog and riding his motorcycle. 'He worked with sick, injured and abandoned animals at a local animal rescue centre. He had a lovely girlfriend and they had plans to move into their first home together in the near future. 'We are all completely overcome by his loss and our lives will feel empty without him.'","Mohammed Zabeur Khan, 49, was making a right turn in Ford Transit van .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A gang of masked robbers burst into a family's home and carried out a series of brutal attacks with a knife and a crowbar after mistaking their house for a drug dealer's. The weapon-wielding attackers broke into the Welsh Valleys home, before launching the terrifying midnight raid, which was described by the judge as 'everyone's nightmare'. In the attack - said to be like 'a scene from a horror film' - the mother was stabbed with a knife, while her daughter was hit with a crowbar and punched repeatedly in the face. The teenage son, who was stabbed twice in the leg while pleading for the attackers to leave his family alone, still cannot walk properly following the assault, the court was told. Scroll down for video . Christopher Edwards, 38, pictured left, and Mark Anthony Peacock, 39, right, were two of the masked robbers who broke into a family's home and carried out a brutal midnight raid after mistaking it for a drug dealer's . Shakira Jane Hellings, 29, pictured left, and Stanley Melville Carey Butler, 40, were another two members of the gang who carried out the attacks at the family's home in the Welsh Valleys . Now the four-strong gang, from Rhondda - who have a long list of previous convictions, including for assaults and burglaries - have been jailed for a total of nearly 40 years. Mark Anthony Peacock, 39, Shakira Jane Hellings, 29, Christopher Edwards, 38, and Stanley Melville Carey Butler, 40, all admitted aggravated burglary and four counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm when they appeared at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court. Jailing the gang, Judge Richard Twomlow said it had been an 'utterly appalling and frightening incident' which had had a devastating effect on the family. He said: 'It is hard to imagine a case which could be very much worse than this. 'This . was an utterly appalling and frightening incident involving serious . violence on a wholly innocent family in their own home. 'It has been . suggested that it is everyone’s nightmare. It is clearly true.' The court heard how the attack took place on June 5, as the family members - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were asleep at home. Rachel Knight, prosecuting, said the eldest daughter was woken up when she heard a man demanding money. When she heard the commotion on the landing, . she went out to find her brother being assaulted. Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Christopher Edwards, 38, from Treorchy, has appeared in court on eight previous occasions for 16 offences, including assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Mark Anthony Peacock, . 39, from Tylorstown, had appeared in court on 36 occasions and has been convicted of 136 offences. This includes 20 convictions for dwelling burglaries or attempted burglaries and violence. Shakira Jane Hellings, 29, from Tyn y Bryn, who had been a law student at Bath University before turning to drugs, has been convicted of 15 offences from nine court appearances. Stanley Melville Carey Butler, from Tylorstown, has 37 previous convictions from 20 court appearances, including for affray, possessing offensive weapons, burglary and violence. The girl managed to grab one of the attackers but was pushed back and hit with a crowbar. She was then repeatedly punched in the face, the court was told. That attack woke up the children's mother, who got up from her bed to try and stop the assault. But, as she tried to reach her children, she was pushed backwards into a wardrobe and stabbed with a knife. Her attacker then made a demand for money before hitting her husband over the head with a crowbar. Ms Knight said the mother managed to strike the attacker with a hammer that had been brought to the scene. But when she went onto the landing, she saw her son being assaulted on the stairs by two of the defendants, one of whom was armed with a knife. The court heard her son was seen pleading with the attackers to leave the family alone. His mother then managed to kick the armed man down the stairs and the four robbers fled the scene. The court heard the burglary and assaults were witnessed . by the family’s youngest child who, although unhurt, was . seen screaming from the bedroom window for help. The robbers were caught less than one hour later after a neighbour saw the van used by the gang and heard the family's call for help. Ms Knight said: 'He said when he went inside it was a scene from a horror film. Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court, where the four robbers were jailed for a collective . 40 years, heard the family had been left traumatised by the incident, . which the judge described as 'everyone's nightmare' 'It was clear that they were targeting this property because they thought he was a drug dealer. That was wrong. They got the wrong house. It was as simple as that.' After the attack, the teenage son had to undergo general surgery and still does not know whether he will recover full movement. He also had to pull out of his college course, the court was told. Ms Knight also said the incident had left the family feeling unsafe in their own home. They were said to be anxious and nervous, as well as  paranoid to the point where they have considered moving. 'It is hard to imagine a case which could be very much worse than this' Judge Richard Twomlow . She said: 'The father said that he had always felt safe in his own home but this had shattered that belief.' The court was told each of the four defendants had criminal records and were remorseful. Defending Edwards, a father-of-two, Ieuan Bennett said the carpenter had got his life on track before spiralling into drink and drugs when his relationship broke down. It was his works van that was used during the burglary, the court was told. Defennding Hellings, Jeremy Jenkins said she had been a law student at Bath University before dropping out because of an abusive relationship and getting hooked on drugs. He said: 'She has had a spectacular fall from grace. Drugs and drink have absolutely ruined her life.' Edwards was jailed for nine years, Butler . was jailed for 10 years and Hellings and Peacock were each jailed for . nine-and-a-half years. Each will have to pay a £120 victim surcharge.","Attackers burst into Welsh Valleys home in June this year while family slept .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A pensioner confined to a wheelchair was crushed to death after a runaway car with no handbrake on rolled down the hill in a hospital car park and trapped him underneath. Double amputee Frederick Morton, 79, was hit by the unmanned car on Monday as he moved across St Marks Hospital car park in Maidenhead, Berkshire, in his electric wheelchair. The 1.5-tonne silver Vauxhall Zafir had crept forward after it appears its female driver got out of the vehicle without the handbrake being properly positioned. Frederick . Morton, 79, was crushed to death by an unmanned car in the car park of St Marks Hospital in Maidenhead, Berkshire, pictured above, which rolled down the . hill after it appears its handbrake was not properly set . She came out of the hospital to find firefighters lifting her car off Mr Morton, who had been knocked from his chair and was trapped underneath the vehicle. Paramedics and doctors tried to revive the pensioner but he was pronounced dead at the scene. It was understood Mr Morton, from Bracknell, Berkshire, had just left a medical appointment at the hospital and was returning to his car when the accident unfolded. The driver, who has not been named by police, recorded a negative drink-drive breath test and passed a roadside fitness test. Mr Morton, a double amputee who relied on a wheelchair, was returning to his car after an appointment when he was killed . She was questioned by police but was not arrested. The vehicle was lifted off Mr Morton by crews from the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service and was later impounded by police for forensic testing. Mr Morton, who was said by neighbours to live an independent life despite his disability, lived in a 1960s-built ground floor maisonette. A neighbour in Ploughlands said: 'It’s absolutely tragic. I just can’t believe it was him who died. 'I would often see him around - he had his own specially adapted car and he seemed to be quite determined and independent.' Thames Valley Police has now appealed for any witnesses to the fatal collision to get in touch. A police spokesman said a file was being prepared for the Berkshire coroner, Peter Bedford, who was awaiting formal identification to take place. A post-mortem examination was due to be conducted at Wexham Park Hospital, Slough. A spokesman for St. Mark’s Hospital . declined to comment on the accident, saying the hospital could not add . anything during a police investigation. Mr Morton lived here in Bracknell, Berkshire, and was said to live an independent lifestyle. A post-mortem is due to be carried out at Wexham Park Hospital, Slough . A police spokesman said: 'Officers were called shortly after 9.30am Monday following a report of an unattended vehicle, a silver Vauxhall Zafira, having collided with a pedestrian in the car park of St Marks Hospital in St Marks Road, Maidenhead. 'The victim, a 79-year-old man from Bracknell, was trapped by the car a d died at the scene.' Police Constable Melanie Todd, who is leading the investigation for the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: 'I would like to speak to any witnesses who saw the collision or anyone with any information which could assist in the investigation.'","Frederick Morton had been at appointment at St Marks Hospital, Maidenhead .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A businessman who three years ago was estimated to be worth nearly £40 million has been given a suspended jail sentence after a judge concluded that he had failed to obey a High Court order to pay maintenance to his ex-wife. Michael Prest’s ex-wife Yasmin had complained that he was in contempt of court and had asked a judge to commit him to prison. Mr Justice Moylan, who on Monday heard evidence at a High Court hearing in London during the latest stage of a long-running divorce cash fight which has been analysed by the Supreme Court, today imposed a four week suspended jail term. Yasmin Prest, 51, pictured left, has told the High Court Family Division in London that her ex-husband Michael, pictured right, has failed to pay her the £17.5m lump sum which she won in their high profile divorce battle . Jeremy Posnansky QC yesterday told High Court Family Division judge Mr Justice Moylan that Ms Prest did not want to send her husband to prison - but that she had no alternative in view of what he had done. Mr Posnansky said Mr Prest had falsely claimed . he was 'impoverished' in order to avoid paying the money. But he said the multi-millionaire had in fact been enjoying lavish holidays to the Caribbean, New York . and France. He had also spent around £12,000 on VIP tickets to a concert . by pop star Justin Bieber for his children and their friends. The court also heard that Mr Prest, who had just returned from Ibiza, was not in court because he was on a three-week holiday in New York with the children. Mr Posnansky said that, although Mr Prest had paid the children’s school fees and . staff costs at Ms Prest’s London home, he had not handed money to his . ex-wife as ordered. He said Mr Prest's 'false claims of . impoverishment' and 'tale of woe' were 'untrue' and that there had been 'widespread and persistent' attempts to mislead the court. In 2011, at an earlier stage of the divorce battle, Mr Justice Moylan ruled that Mr Prest's net assets were worth £37.5m. The couple, who divorced in 2011 after an 18-year marriage, spent most of their time in London, where they shared this property in Maida Vale, but also had properties in Nigeria and the Caribbean . He ordered Mr Prest to make a lump sum . payment of £17.5m, as well as annual payments of £300,000, to his . wife and their four children. The decision was later overturned at the Court of Appeal but was successfully appealed by Ms Prest at the Supreme Court - the highest court in the UK - in June last year. Mr Prest, who is said to be in his 50s, was not at the hearing but was represented by his lawyer, Sarah Dines. Ms Dines told the judge that a doctor had assessed Mr Prest as being unable to attend the hearing, 'both emotionally and physically' due to ill health. But the judge rejected his bid to adjourn the case for one year on the grounds of ill health, saying he was clearly not too ill to fly to New York. Mr Justice Moylan, sitting at the High Court Family Division in London, . today give his ruling and . Ms Dines said Mr Prest had described his oil trading days as being 'over' and that his accounts had been closed and staff made redundant. She also read a letter from Mr Prest to the court, in which he said he had 'never run away from anything'. He added that he had 'engaged in the process', had not 'shirked responsibilities' and had taken care of his children. The letter read said: 'I have not killed anyone, nor have I committed any crime. I have simply slipped on the accident of life. 'I have taken care of my children and will always do so. Any suggestion that I am running away is unfortunate.' The couple - who married in 1993 and divorced in 2011 - spent most of their married life in London but also had properties in Nigeria and the Caribbean, the court heard. Both Mr and Ms Prest have dual British and . Nigerian citizenship and lived to a 'very high standard', the court was told. 'I have not killed anyone, nor have I committed any crime. I have simply slipped on the accident of life' Michael Prest . Ms Prest still lives in the £5m . family home in Maida Vale, west London, which she . kept under the divorce settlement. Three years ago, at the first stage of the couple's divorce battle, Mr Justice Moylan concluded that Mr Prest had made 'various attempts' to conceal the extent of assets. The judge then made a wealth assessment 'doing the best he could' on the material available. Properties which were held in the name of companies controlled by Mr Prest were a central issue in the court case. Mr Justice Moylan initially ordered Mr Prest to transfer properties held in the names of companies he controlled to his ex-wife. But the Court of Appeal disagreed and said Mr Prest did not have to hand property to Ms Prest. In June 2013, the Supreme Court overturned the decision and ruled in Ms Prest’s favour. That court ruled that houses owned . by Petrodel Resources Ltd and other Isle of Man-registered companies . controlled by her husband in London and the West Indies can be sold to . settle her award of £17.5m. The . seven judges unanimously overturned an Appeal Court ruling that . companies owned by the oil trader were not family assets and . could not be taken into account when calculating a divorce payout. The judge will give his ruling on the latest court hearing later today.

"By . Press Association . A 'supermoon' lit up the sky tonight as stargazers enjoyed the Perseid meteor shower - one of the year's most dramatic lunar events. The moon appeared 14% bigger and 30% brighter than normal as it reached the point in its orbit closest to the Earth, known as 'perigee'. Many enthusiasts grabbed their mobile phones to take a snapshot of the spectacle - which comes  two days before the meteor shower reaches its peak. A 'supermoon' appears behind the Angel of Peace sculpture in London (AP) It's Moonumental: The supermoon is seen as it rises through the clouds behind the bronze Statue of Freedom by Thomas Crawford atop the U.S. Capitol . Lunar celebration: Fireworks streak past in front of the supermoon outside the town of Mosta, celebrating the feast of its patron saint, in central Malta . Super bright: A supermoon rises above the U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial  in Arlington Virginia . Given a dark, clear sky in a normal year, it is common to see more than 100 of the meteors an hour during the second week in August. Dr Bill Cooke from the American space agency Nasa's Meteoroid Environment Office, said the luminous 'supermoon' risked drowning out the meteor shower. He said: 'Lunar glare wipes out the black-velvety backdrop required to see faint meteors, and sharply reduces counts.' Dr Cooke added that the Perseids were also ""rich in fireballs as bright as Jupiter or Venus"" that would remain visible despite the moon's glare.

Bird's eye veiw: A bird flies as a perigee full moon, also known as 'supermoon', rises over Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic . Lunar time: A supermoon rises over the Peace Tower on Ottawa's Parliament Hill as seen from Gatineau, Quebec . A study conducted by his team since 2008 has shown the Perseids to be the undisputed ""fireball champion"" of meteor showers. 'We see more fireballs from Swift-Tuttle than any other parent comet,' said Dr Cooke. Every 133 years, comet Swift-Tuttle swings through the inner Solar System leaving behind a trail of dust. When the Earth passes through, the dust cloud particles hit the atmosphere at 140,000 mph and burn up in streaking flashes of light, creating the spectacle known as the Perseids. The meteors will be visible until Wednesday, with activity peaking on Tuesday. An unusually bright full 'supermoon' was also seen on July 12, and another is due to appear on September 9. Supermoons occur relatively often, every 13 months and 18 days, but are not always noticed because of clouds or poor weather.

"By . Lucy Waterlow . A mother-of-three has revealed how she created the illusion of having a perfect family life when she and her husband were in fact addicted to heroin. The former drug user, who only wanted to be identified as Marie, shared her story on today's This Morning. Her experience echoes that of Peaches Geldof, whose death from an overdose recently shocked the nation. The star, 25, gave the impression of being the perfect wife and mother-of-two via her social media posts and public appearances. But her recent inquest revealed she was secretly taking heroin. Heroin-addicted mother: Marie shared her story on today's This Morning . Shock overdose: Like the late Peaches Geldof, Marie appeared to be the perfect mother but took drugs behind closed doors . Like Peaches, Marie told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford how she kept her addiction secret while successfully fulfilling her roles as a doting mother and reliable employee. Her children, neighbours and other mothers she met on the school run had no idea about her life behind closed doors. She said: I was like a chameleon, I would blend in wherever I was...  it was like two totally different worlds.' Marie confessed that during the day, she was the perfect mother and was a complete professional in her job as a therapist. But after the children had gone to school or bed, she and her husband, Francis, would take heroin. 'Nobody knew. We over compensated on how we looked,' she explained of their public image. They soon both became addicts and as their wages weren't enough to cover the cost of their habit, Marie started shop lifting. Likening herself to a modern-day Robin Hood, Marie said she said she felt like it was her 'purpose' to shop lift from stores including Tesco and Marks and Spencers and give many of the goods away. She admits shop lifting also became an addiction and as the amounts she stole eventually exceeded what she needed to buy heroin, she would then shower her ill-gotten goods on friends and family. They thought she was a successful and generous career woman sharing her wealth and had no idea their gifts had actually been stolen. Another addiction: The mother-of-three told Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford how she started shoplifting to fund her drug habit . Recalling how her drug use began, Marie - also like Peaches - had a childhood marred by tragedy. When she was seven, her younger sister died in a terrible accident. Marie said that the loss of her sibling was 'without a doubt' the trigger for her drug use. 'Nothing made sense after that and I really struggled at school,' she explained. She first started taking drugs at the age of 13 and by the age of 17, she was admitted to rehab. Unable to break her habit, she began her prolific shop lifting to fund it - which eventually led to her being imprisoned and then being put on another rehabilitation programme. 'I was like a chameleon': Marie said friends and neighbours had no idea she took heroin . Kicked the habit: Martie realised she had to stop taking drugs for the sake of her children . It was there that she met her husband and the couple embarked on a clean life together, getting married and having three children. But when their lives were touched by tragedy again, they turned back to drugs to cope. 'Francis's mum passed away and my mum passed way and there were a few other bereavements in family,' Marie said. 'I don't want to glorify heroin but it gives you a ""Ready Break"" feeling - a warm glow, it took the pain away.' She added: 'We thought it would be a one-off but were quickly both addicted again.' Marie admits that her facade as a perfect mother eventually began to crack and she 'lost the plot and started self harming'. As Francis returned to rehab, she realised she had to support him and change her own life for the sake of her family. 'I thought I have these three amazing children - why do I I keep doing the same behaviours?' she said. She gave up the drugs and 'weaned' herself off shop lifting and has now been clean for seven years.","Marie shared her story on today's This Morning .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Getting married is cherished as the biggest and best day of your life - so would you let strangers decide how it will unfold? That's exactly what Cara Day, 29, and David Giles, 32, from Dorset, are doing after winning a competition run by Pearl Drops. The couple have passed the entire decision-making for their white wedding over to the public who will choose everything from where the reception will take place to what the bride will wear. Scroll down for video . Dress A: Bride-to-be Cara in the Essense of Australia gown which has layers of beautiful tulle and a detachable decorated sash . Dress B: A Martina Liana design with a sweetheart neckline and embroidered Alencon lace with a long train . Dress C: Enzoani's 'Dakota' gown in ivory with a sweetheart neckline, fitted bodice, and a flared mermaid skirt . A public vote has already decided that their venue will be the picturesque Larmer Tree Gardens in Salisbury, Wiltshire. And voting is now underway to decide which dress mother-of-three Cara will walk down the aisle in. Lucky for the bride-to-be, she looks stunning in each of the three choices - which are all strapless with a sweetheart neckline. Dress A, by Essense of Australia, has layers of beautiful tulle, a figure-flattering bodice and a detachable decorated sash. Dress B is a Martina Liana design with a sweetheart neckline and embroidered Alencon lace with a train with scalloped lace edging. The final choice, dress C, is Enzoani's 'Dakota' gown in ivory with a sweetheart neckline, fitted bodice, and a flared mermaid skirt. Soon to be Mr and Mrs: David and Cara will have been together for five years when they tie the knot in October . Despite giving up all control over her white wedding, Cara said she and David are 'extremely excited about the whole process'. The up side of them sacrificing decision-making is that their £25,000 nuptials will all be paid for. The couple won the prize after entering Pearl Drops competition when it opened in May. They won the judges over with their 30 second video which showed them larking around and revealed how much their three children - Maya, aged nine, Giana, three, and Arabella, 14 months, wanted their parents to tie the knot. They held up signs stating they would love to be bridesmaids and share the same surname. Now their dream has come true as their mother and father will become Mr and Mrs at a ceremony in October. When they tie the knot, Cara and David will have been together for five years, although they have known each other since they were teenagers. Cara explains: 'We first dated when we were around 17 years old, but it only lasted a month or so and we went our seperate ways and bizarrely never saw each other again, even though we have lived in a five mile radius of each other. 'It wasn't until eight years later, I had a random dream about David one night, which resulted in me thinking about him and wondering how he was and what he was up to. I ended up searching for him on Facebook. Dream come true: The couple have three daughters who can't wait to be bridesmaids after their parents won the prize of a £25,000 wedding . Blushing bride: Cara, pictured in the Martina Liana dress, says she can't wait to get married - even though she has no control over the day . 'I contacted him and found that he was severely ill in hospital and was in the process of being diagnosed with Crohns disease, the same thing I was diagnosed with shortly after we had split up when I was 18 years old. 'I offered to come into hospital to see him and talk to him about my experience with having Crohns disease and maybe offer some advice. When we met again even though we hadn't seen each other in years there was no awkwardness at all and we didn't stop talking until I was kicked out at the end of visiting hours!' She added: 'When I left the hospital all I could think about was seeing him again and thankfully the feeling was mutual as we constantly talked for the next week until he was discharged.' Their relationship went from strength to strength and David soon moved in with Cara and her daughter, Maya, from a previous relationship, who was four at the time. However, plans for a big white wedding were far from their minds due to David's ill-health. He had to return to hospital for an operation and the couple experienced some financial difficulties. Cara said: 'The start of our relationship wasn't all ""hearts and flowers"" but we never seemed to struggle, we just got on with fixing all the things that went wrong and putting the pieces back together. One of the reasons I think we're so strong as a couple is because we are constantly laughing together, until this day David is still the funniest person I have ever met!' The couple then decided to try for a baby and Giana was born on 3rd May 2011. Cara then sadly had a miscarriage in 2012 but she was delighted when they then welcomed Arabella who was born on 10th May 2013. David proposed on Christmas Day 2013 and now Cara said she can't wait till the day they officially become man and wife. She said: 'We have three beautiful girls and David and I are still inseparable, I don't know who is more excited when Dave comes home from work, our daughters or me! 'I cannot wait for the day that I can finally call him my husband.' To cast your vote for Cara's dress and other aspects of their big day in the coming weeks, visit Pearl Drops Facebook page .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . When it was unveiled earlier this month, Scotland's uniform for the Commonwealth Games was widely ridiculed. There was even a petition set up which gained hundreds of signatures calling for it to be replaced. But this evening, Scottish athletes wore the lurid bright blue tartan with pride as they walked round Celtic Park stadium in Glasgow during the championship's opening ceremony. The athletes paraded in front of the stadium crowd, which included the Queen, in their Jilli Blackwood designed outfits which have been described as 'embarrassing', 'shocking' and 'humiliating' by people on social media. Scroll down for video . Who's laughing now: The Scots were happy to show off their much ridiculed uniforms at the opening ceremony . Host nation: The Scots outfits certainly meant they stood out in Celtic Park stadium . Unpopular: The Scotland kit was ridiculed when it was unveiled earlier this month . The designer said she wanted to give traditional tartan a contemporary twist by teaming it with bright blue shirts and dresses. But those who signed a petition, started by Glaswegian Brian Scott on Change.org calling for it to be ditched, said it made a mockery of the host nation. But Scotland weren't the only country whose kit has been lambasted in the run up to the games. The Australian outfits designed by Adele Walters, from Australian Defence Apparel, also left a lot to be desired. Without sparing their peer's feelings, another fashion designer, Charlie Brown, said the Aussie jackets have a 'Captain Kirk from Star Trek' look to them and that the jumpers look 'homemade.' Proud: Despite being mocked in the build up to the games, the Australians wore their Star Trek style jackets with pride at the opening ceremony .

Wrapped up for a British summer (don't tell them we've had a heat wave): Australia's Commonwealth Games athletes model the team's outfit in the run up to the games . The Australia team were also equipped . with woolly scarves to help them keep warm during the British summer. Walters told the MailOnline earlier this month that she wasn't bothered about the criticism. 'I don't want to dwell on the . negatives,' she said. 'I've heard it, and you expect it from some . people, I'd rather talk about the positives.' Walters was the lead . designer on the project in a team of five, who constructed the uniforms . based on its functionality, comfort and style. She said the uniform's 'brief' had been stuck too and that the athletes . approved. They certainly looked proud as they modelled the yellow and green kit this evening. Perhaps . they felt they didn't look so silly after all after seeing the uniforms . of some of their fellow competitors from other countries. Tropical: The team from the Cook Islands wore flowers in their hair with their floral print frocks . Feminine: The British Virgin Island team wore colourful frilled dresses . Drab trousers: The England team were full of enthusiasm if not style . The Scots weren't the only ones in . tartan as the team from St Lucia also wore the pattern and the Canadians . wore tartan trousers. While some countries like St Helena . stuck to track suits in their nation's colours, others were more . adventurous with their outfits. The Malaysian uniform was certainly . eye-catching. Their bright orange garb was accessorised with tiger print . - but poignantly, they also wore black arm bands in remembrance of the . victims of the recent Malaysian airline disasters. The Maldives were also prepared to shine as night fell on the stadium as they wore high-vis style neon jackets. The Cook Islands, Norfolk Island and . Papua New Guinea all paid homage to their tropical climates with bright . Hawaiian style shirts. The Cook Island female athletes topped off their looks . with colourful flower garlands on their heads. Sticking with tradition: The team from Tonga wore their formal attire of woven mats - but this athlete also embraced the host nation by donning a Celtic shirt . Surf's up: Norfolk Island's squad wore bright shirts . More tartan: This time in the St Lucia team outfits . Neon: The athletes from The Maldives were brightly dressed . Ready to board: Singapore's team looked a little like air hostesses with their red blazers and silk scarves . All Blacks: The New Zealand kit also kept with tradition . On trend: The Welsh women look good in flattering red dresses . Team Wales: The cardigans gave the outfits a more relaxed look . Like the Scots in their kilts, the . team from Tonga chose to reflect their country's signature style by . wearing their traditional formal attire which consists of woven mats. Meanwhile, the team from Barbados looked like a an American High School team in their baseball style jackets while the team from Singapore were reminiscent of air hostesses in their red jackets and silk scarves. One team who didn't stand out from . the crowd was England, who played it safe in black blazers, red . shirts and drab beige trousers. The New Zealand athletes also stuck to what they know - wearing black rugby-style shirts. The red dress has quickly started to overtake the LBD and so the Welsh team took the prize for the most on trend style with their flattering red dresses.

"By . Lucy Waterlow . When Sara Price-Parker's mother made the heartbreaking decision to have her adopted, she hoped she would be giving her daughter a childhood free from pain and suffering. But Denise Sanderson - who was 23 and single when she became pregnant - could not have known that her daughter's beloved adoptive mother, Brenda, would be struck down by cancer while Sara was still a child. Aged just nine, the little girl had to watch as Brenda's health deteriorated, and she died when Sara was only 16. Reunited after 44 years: Sara Price-Parker and her mother, Denise Sanderson, who had her adopted as a baby in the hope it would give her a  better life . Now 44, Sara, from South Wirral, said it was terrible seeing her mother in pain. 'I couldn't . cope with it at all,' she said. 'She got so sick I would avoid coming home. I . couldn't handle seeing someone I loved so much so ill. 'When she died the backbone of the family was gone - the laughter and . the spark. I felt cheated. Cheated that I didn't have a mum anymore.' Sara always knew she had been adopted by Brenda and her husband, David. They said she made their family complete as she became a sibling for their son, John. Heartbroken at losing Brenda, two years later she decided to seek out her biological parent, Denise. She recalls: 'Although . I felt the betrayal towards my adoptive mum, the questions I wanted . answering wouldn't go away. I wanted to know what her life was like, . what happened to her?' Through her research, Sara discovered that Denise had also had a sad childhood, losing her own mother when she was just seven. Holding her baby again: Denise said giving her daughter away was the hardest thing she's ever had to do . Sara explained: 'She lost a parent at an early age and I . did. The paperwork said she wanted me to grow up in a normal family with . two parents which she never had, it must have been a horrendous . and heartbreaking decision to make.' Via the adoption paperwork, Sara was able to find out the address where Denise had lived when she was 23 but she had long moved on. Sara wrote to the neighbours and they recollected her living at the home but believed she had emigrated to Jamaica. This brought Sara's search to a dead end. She went on to marry her husband, Mike, and they have a son, Joel, 12. Sara said being a mother made her realise how much she missed her own mum. She said: 'I adore being a mum. It's this little person walking around who's a piece of . you. But I haven't had a mum for so long, I can't remember what it must . be like to have a mum.' Decades on from when she first started searching and still desperate to see if she could find her biological mother, she enlisted the help of ITV show Long Lost Family. She said on the show: 'I feel cheated, I've lost two mums. there's a huge gap in my life. I need to find her.' The programme researchers discovered Denise had married a man called Alfred Sanderson (nicknamed Sandy) in Blackpool a few months after Sara was born and they had eventually settled in Oregon. The show's presenter Nicky Campbell flew across the Atlantic to hear Denise's story and find out if she would be willing to be reunited with her long lost daughter. Retired Denise, now 67, said knowing Sara was searching for her was a dream come true. She explained how giving her daughter up had been the worst day of her life. She told of how Sara was conceived and how she thought giving her away would mean she would have a better life. Happy ending: Long Lost Family presenters Davina McCall and Nicky Campbell helped mother and daughter find one another again after Denise had emigrated to the U.S . 'When I was 17 I came to live in Blackpool with my sister, that's where I met Sara's father. We went out for three years and got engaged but it was a stormy relationship. When I found out I was pregnant I realised it wouldn't be good and finished with him,' she explained. 'I thought the best thing for Sarah was for her to be adopted. She was put into a foster home for six weeks and I went to see her every weekend with Sandy, who I had met when I was seven months pregnant.' Denise sad she didn't consider keeping Sara and raising her with Sandy as they 'had only been going out for a couple of months so I didn't know what was going to happen.' She hoped by giving Sara away, she could guarantee she would have a happy childhood. But she said saying goodbye to her baby was the hardest thing she'd ever had to do. She recalled through tears: 'When you go to the adoption agency, straight away the baby is taken off you. You go to another room to do the paperwork and that's it, you never see your a baby again. That was really hard.' She added: 'I just wanted her to have the best as I had a messy childhood, I didn't want there to be any chance of her having a bad childhood.' Denise took comfort from a letter Brenda and David sent her after they adopted Sara in which they wrote of their love for the baby and gratitude to Denise. They said they would tell her of Denise when she was old enough to understand. Brenda and David were loving parents and they were able to give Sara the idyllic and stable childhood Denise had desired for her. But she was devastated to hear that Sara's happiness was cut short when Brenda was diagnosed with cancer. Success: The presenters made it possible for Denise and Sara to meet again in Blackpool in tear-jerking scenes in Monday's show . Sara said despite the trauma, she has no regrets about her upbringing and is glad she was able to be raised by Brenda and David. She told the show's other presenter, Davina McCall, of Denise's decision to give her away: 'She did the right thing, I have had such a nice life. She couldn't foresee what would happen. I wouldn't change anything.' Sara said she was delighted she had a 'second chance' at being a daughter again after Denise had been tracked down and agreed to come back to England to meet her. 'Wouldn't it be lovely to have someone to confide in and to phone up, to have a grandmother for Joel,' she said wistfully. On hearing this, Denise said: 'I'm honoured she thinks I can fill the gap in her life left by her adoptive mother.'

"By . Lucy Waterlow . A teenager has admitted he deeply regrets sexually abusing a girl who was younger than him and below the age of consent. Louis (not his real name), 17, from Devon, has said he made 'the biggest mistake' of his life when he started a sexual relationship with the daughter of his father's girlfriend. The college student said the relationship began innocently when he moved in with his father and his new family after his single mother decided he would be better off living with them. Innocence lost: Now 17, Louis regrets a sexual relationship he had with a younger girl which took place when he was 14 (posed by model) He said it was a difficult time but becoming an older brother figure to the girl made him feel loved. He explains: 'My life turned upside down when my mum . moved away from the area, leaving me to live with my dad who I hadn't . seen for many years. 'When my mum left me, it felt like I had a piece . missing for a while and I was left wondering what would happen next; it was a very upsetting time. I was so lonely, upset and confused. 'It was strange getting to know my dad, his partner and her . children. Dad and his . partner thought it was good that I could talk to the youngest girl and . when we went out together as a family we would hold hands like brother . and sister.' He added that spending more time with the girl as a sibling led to something more sinister. He said: 'Our relationship turned into a really close friendship and . we would spend time together, going out to the park, watching movies - . it was good until our close friendship turned into a sexual . relationship.' Louis was 14 at the time and the girl was younger than him. He said he didn't realise then that what he was doing was wrong and that she wasn't old enough to consent to his advances. 'I thought she was enjoying what we were doing and this led me in the wrong direction,' he now admits. The abuse was eventually discovered by their parents but Louis said at this stage he still didn't fully comprehend the gravity of the situation or that what he was doing was wrong. His father trying to prevent him from being with the girl only made him want her more. He said: 'Neither of us told anyone what was . happening but then I was caught performing indecent behaviour with her. Dad and his girlfriend went mad when they caught us and they tried to . stop me being with her. 'Dad's telling off made me feel like no one cared . about me other than the girl so things did not change, instead they got . worse.' He added: 'When my dad and his partner realised they . could not stop me getting close to her they called Children's Services . and the police became involved. Boundaries were put in place to make . sure the girl and I did not spend time together. But the boundaries . didn't stop me. I managed to get away with most of what I had done by . looking for the ""golden opportunity"" when we were not supervised . properly, until I was caught again.' Louis has shared his story as new figures released by the NSPCC have revealed that more than 8,000 under-18s in Britain were . accused of sexual offences against other children in the last two years. According to NSPCC figures, most under age victims of sexual abuse knew their alleged abuser and some of the most common crimes were teenage boys attacking female acquaintances . Like Louis's victim, most knew their alleged abuser and some of the most common crimes were teenage boys attacking female acquaintances. The charity state that whilst these crimes are shocking, this . behaviour can be turned around if caught early. They offer a 'Turn the Page' programme to help young offenders change their behaviour and stop . them committing more sexual crimes as they get older. It was thanks to this intervention from the NSPCC that Louis was able to turn his life around and his victim was also given the full support she needed. Louis was moved into a foster home to keep him away from the victim and had counselling to help him understand why his behaviour was wrong. 'The NSPCC helped me to see that I was not taking responsibility for what was happening,' he explained. 'I had tricked myself into thinking it was a relationship. NSPCC taught me things like consent and the legal age you can agree to have a sexual relationship and this helped me to realise it was my fault.' He added that the children's charity helped him get to the root of his own problems and that turning to the girl was not the answer. Now three years on, he feels full of remorse for what happened and is determined to put the experience behind him and never commit such a crime again. He said: 'The support I received from the NSPCC has . helped me recognise that people around me, even people I did not know, . do care about me. This has made me feel happy and determined to change . my life. 'I now feel I have the confidence, knowledge and skills to take full responsibility of my life. I only want to move in one direction toward a successful career, a respectful relationship and happy life.' Louis is an example of how the NSPCC can offer support in horrific circumstances and prevent further abuse. Peter Wanless, CEO of the NSPCC, said: 'It's deeply concerning that thousands of children are committing sexual offences including serious assaults and rape. For young children in particular we have to question the environment in which they are growing up that has led to them behaving in this way. 'Prevention has to be the key and that is recognising warning signs early and taking swift action. It could be that they have seen sexual activity that they are just too young to understand and are copying what they've seen. 'We also know that pornography for many older children is now part of life. Easy access to hard core, degrading and often violent videos on the internet is warping views of what is normal or acceptable behaviour. It is also feeding into ""sexting"" where teenagers are creating and distributing their own videos and images that are illegal and have led to prison sentences. 'But these children are not beyond help. If we act quickly and children receive therapy such as that provided by the NSPCC's ""Turn the Page"" service we can stop them becoming adult sex offenders. 'And, most importantly, their victims need support to overcome what has happened to them. Sexual offences, whether committed by another child or an adult, can have lifelong consequences.' The charity advise parents to help keep their children safe by teaching them the 'Underwear Rule' which is a simple, effective and age appropriate way of telling children what is and isn't acceptable behaviour. Parents simply tell their children that the area covered by their underwear should never be touched by anyone else. Any adult worried about a child or in need of help and advice can contact the NSPCC's helpline on 0808 800 5000. Children and young people can contact ChildLine on 0800 1111.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A young British couple were part of a global internet banking scam which could have netted a phenomenal £19million after hacking the accounts of nearly 2,500 people. Aderoju Bammeke, 22, and his girlfriend Jessica Ogunyemi, 20, both of Manchester, were the UK 'platform' for a Nigerian 'phishing' scam that made £41,000 in just two months. The plot, masterminded by a gang in the West African country, involved sending fake emails to customers of banks including Barclays and Halifax. Scam: Aderoju Bammeke, left, 22, and his girlfriend Jessica Ogunyemi, right, 20, both of Manchester, were the UK 'platform' for a Nigerian 'phishing' scam that made £41,000 in just two months . The emails told recipients that their accounts had been hacked and asked them to complete a form with their log-in details. But when victims obliged, Bammeke stepped in and helped the gang log in to steal money. Fashion marketing student Ogunyemi, his girlfriend at the time, helped him launder the proceeds by putting funds in accounts, hiding cash and allowing him to buy her a £2,400 Vauxhall Corsa. Bammeke has now been jailed for three-and-a-half years at Manchester Crown Court after admitting conspiracy to commit fraud and unauthorised computer use. Ogunyemi admitted five counts of money laundering and was given a suspended prison sentence. Investigators found evidence of the scam on seven devices at Bammeke's home, which had accessed 181 accounts from his address. But Barclays found 2,439 customers had been affected and investigators say the true scale of the fraud will never be known. Bammeke admitted he had been involved in the scam for more than a year. He played a 'key role' as England's 'platform' for the scam, the court heard. He said if the gang had tried to log into accounts from Nigeria it would have triggered the banks' alarm systems. Simon Nichol, defending Bammeke, said he felt regret and remorse for his actions. He said his involvement - which began in an effort to tackle student debt - was 'sporadic' and although the scam was large scale with international dimensions, Bammeke's part was not. He added: 'They needed a platform in this jurisdiction and they needed someone to provide that platform. He allowed them to use his computer remotely. He expresses further regret that he got his girlfriend involved in this.' 'Naive': Fashion marketing student Ogunyemi, Bammeke's girlfriend at the time, helped him launder the proceeds by putting funds in accounts, hiding cash and allowing him to buy her a £2,400 Vauxhall Corsa . Michael Lavery, defending Ogunyemi, said she had brought shame on her family, including her train driver father and mother who works for Manchester council. He said she had been 'naive', was predicted to get a first in her degree and was no longer in a relationship with Bammeke. Bammeke had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to conspiracy to commit fraud and unauthorised computer use while Ogunyemi admitted five counts of money laundering. Sentencing Bammeke, Judge Recorder Gibson said: 'This in my opinion was a sophisticated fraud, a clever fraud and a fraud which could very easily have resulted in very much more substantial money being stolen.' He jailed Ogunyemi for a year, suspended for two years, and ordered her to complete 180 hours' unpaid work. After the hearing, Detective Superintendent Janet Hudson of TITAN, the North-West Regional Crime Unit, said: 'The actions of Bammeke and Ogunyemi caused a great deal of stress and uncertainty to many affected bank customers who had their accounts accessed. 'As a result of the investigation, no customers were left out of pocket and the offenders were arrested and ultimately sentenced. Internet banking is considered a safe and secure method of banking. 'However, bank customers need to remain vigilant and aware of the danger posed by fraudsters. Customers should only ever navigate directly to an online bank website and should never click on any link sent to them through an email. 'Additionally when accessing bank accounts online customers should always be aware of the exact address in order to ensure that they are actually on a legitimate banking website.'","Aderoju Bammeke helped Nigerian fraudsters evade bank safety mechanisms .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . The banks of the river Thames in Oxfordshire became awash with colour today as the Henley Royal Regatta got underway. And for once it wasn't the women's fashions brightening up the scene but the men's. Male rowers and spectators wore bright blazers in a rainbow of shades. Here come the boys in blazers: Club members show off their natty numbers . Bright: These orange trimmed blazers are certainly eye-catching . Badge of honour: Rowers wear blazers in different colours to show which club or country they compete for . Dressed to impress: Of course it's not just the men who wear stylish blazers . Dress code: Men in the Steward's Enclosure must wear lounge suits, jackets or blazers with flannels and a tie or cravat . In the pink: This spectator has a cap and blazer matching their boat . The preppy jackets come in stripes and checks with an array of different colours. But while they may make the wearer look dapper, on closer inspection some can be somewhat stained and threadbare. This is because, according to the oarsmen, they refuse to get them dry cleaned in order to follow the age old tradition of wearing the coffee and beer stains of the past as a 'badge of honour'. Lengthy issue: Women in the Steward's Enclosure are told that they will not be admitted if their skirts do not have a hemline below the knee . On all week: Men arrive for the first day of the races . What it's all about: The Men's VIII from Hitotsubashi University, Japan lift their boat out of the water after winning their Temple Challenge Cup race . Picnic with a view: Spectators enjoy the races in the sunshine . This also explains why some appear to not quite fit, as they have been passed down a family through the generations regardless of if they are the same size. The stains, missing buttons and patches are all part of what makes the blazers a part of the regatta's 175-year history. Rowers wear blazers in different colours to show which club or country they compete for. In some cases they are also a clue to the wearer's success on the water due to the insignia, such as stripes on the cuffs. The men will be showing off their style for the rest of the week as the regatta continues until Sunday. During this time, thousands of people will attend to watch more than 200 races. Still in style: The event is proud of its 175-year-old traditions . Leisurely afternoon for some: Spectators lounge along the riverbank as the rowers by go . Job done: Rowers carry their oars back from the water, left, while this dog wants to join in the fun, right . Competition: There will be more than 200 races over the course of the regatta . Quintessentially British: The event is a key part of the summer sporting calendar . Last bastion of class: Those headed to the Steward's Enclosure must stick to the rules on dress and use of mobiles . Snapped snapping: A viewer takes a picture of the scene . The regatta has been held ever year since 1839 - except during the two World Wars. The event is often described as the last bastion of class in the British summer season as it has stuck to its quintessential English traditions. A dress code is strictly enforced while more recently, rules have been adopted on the use of mobile phones. The guidelines for the Steward's Enclosure stipulate that men must wear lounge suits, jackets or blazers with flannels and a tie or cravat. Meanwhile women are told that they should wear dresses or suits and will not be admitted if their skirts do not have a hemline below the knee. Hats are 'customary' but not mandatory. The dress codes states that no-one wearing shorts or jeans will be admitted. The Henley Royal Regatta website adds: 'Members . are particularly asked to bring the dress code to the attention of . their Guests, to ensure that the standards are maintained and to avoid . the possibility of embarrassment of a Guest being refused admission.' Set for a fun day: When it comes to women's wear, hats are welcomed but are not  mandatory . Ready to row: Rowers carry their boat from the storage tents . Historic sight: The event has been held in Henley for more than a century . They explain that use of mobile phones is also strictly prohibited 'to . minimise the inconvenience and annoyance caused to others'. They write: 'Those seen making or receiving . calls on their mobile phones will be reminded of this ban by Security . Guards and Regatta Officials, asked to stop and a note taken of their . Badge number.  This will allow identification of the responsible Member. If . the request to stop is ignored, or if the same person is caught a . second time, then the person will be escorted out of the Enclosure and . their badge forfeited.' While they couldn't take selfies or update their Facebook statuses, today's guests did have the British weather on their side so they could enjoy picnics on the river banks as the rowers raced by.","175th Henley Royal Regatta began today on River Thames .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . After decades of male dominance, women are finally making in-roads as racing car drivers. This July, Susie Wolff will be the first woman to take part in a Formula 1 Grand Prix for 22 years as she will test drive cars in her role as a development driver for Williams Martini Racing. And now another female driver is making history as it has been announced that British born Katherine Legge has been selected as a driver for Amlin's Formula E motor racing team. Driving force: Katherine Legge has been selected as a driver for Amlin's Formula E motor racing team . Fast female: The 33-year-old said she's looking forward to speeding through the streets . Katherine, 33, from Surrey, is the first female driver in the Formula E Championship, a new initiative from the FIA which was established in 2012. She said: 'For me this is a really exciting opportunity. The car is fantastic, it looks amazing and it will be very quick. 'Racing through the streets of the world's leading cities will be an incredible experience and I think it's a great chance to bring racing to the people. We will be driving in their cities on their streets.' The Formula E cars look similar to their Formula 1 cousins but the engine, power train and power supply are unique. Driven: Katherine is an experienced IndyCar racer . New series: The Formula E cars look similar to their Formula 1 cousins but are electric . Formula E cars accelerate from 0-100km/h in under three seconds and will reach speeds of up to 225km/h. The fundamental difference is that these cars are powered by a battery and represent the cutting edge of electric vehicle technology. The research and development supporting the Championship has the potential to radically change transport systems around the world, particularly in urban areas, where air pollution caused by fossil fuels is a serious concern. Serious about winning: Katherine has raced in several developmental open-wheel series in Britain, including Formula Three, Formula Renault and Formula Ford . Cutting edge technology: Formula E cars accelerate from 0-100km/h in under three seconds and will reach speeds of up to 225km/h . Amlin's team, based in Donnington, are led by team principal Mark Preston and are currently preparing for their first race in this new Championship, which will begin in Beijing on 13th September. 'Formula E will be a very exciting and demanding Championship and I think it brings an interesting new dimension to the sport. This is as much about strategy as it is about driving fast - it's playing Chess at 220 km/h, said Mark. CEO of Amlin, Charles Philipps, said he was 'very excited' about the championship and said Katherine has been selected to drive as a a serious podium contender. He said: 'We are serious about racing and serious about winning.' Katherine has been race car driving for years and is a seasoned competitor in the IndyCar series in the U.S. She has raced in several developmental open-wheel series in Britain, including Formula Three, Formula Renault and Formula Ford. In . 2005 she was given RACER Magazine's 'Most Promising Road Racer of The . Year' award - previous winners include Kimi Räikkönen, Jenson Button and . Cristiano da Matta. So could Katharine's career in Formula E lead to become a champion of Formula 1? She has already been behind the wheel of an F1 car having test driven for the Minardi team at Vallelunga near Rome in 2005. Another Brit making history: Susie Wolff is a development driver for the Williams F1 team and will take part in July's Silverstone Grand Prix . One of the team: Susie with her teammates Valtteri Bottas, Felipe Massa and Felipe Nasr . But as Susie Wolff has discovered, breaking into F1 driving isn't easy. Many doubt whether women are physically capable of dealing with the G-forces encountered when F1 driving while former British racing driver Sir Stirling Moss told the BBC in April that he doesn't think women have the 'mental aptitude to race hard, wheel-to-wheel.' Women like Susie and Katherine inevitably have to deal with sexism in the male dominated sport. 'I've lost count of the amount of times I've been asked, ""Do you have a lipstick holder in your car?"",' Susie told the Daily Express last week. She added: 'It's got easier to deal with over time. There will always be comments no matter what you do. You'll always have those that are for you and those that are against you... It's hard for their (men's) egos to cope with a girl beating them.' But with more women taking to the track, men might have to start getting used to it.","Katherine, 33, from Surrey, will drive for Amlin's Formula E team .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . BB creams have been a hot topic in the beauty industry over the last few years because of their promises to roll back the years. First there were products containing wrinkle-busting ingredients for your skin, then anti-ageing unguents for your hair - and now there's even one for your nails. American brand ORLY has launched what they say is an industry first with their BB creme for nails. New concern: Now we have to worry about the ageing appearance of our nails but ORLY's creme promises to roll back the years . BB stands for blemish base and the facial creams are said to make your skin look younger, smoother and brighter. They double up as both a moisturiser and primer. Some even have sun protection. ORLY has taken the multi-functional concept and applied it to nails with its new product - it will hit shelves in August at £15 a bottle. It says the ingredients in its BB creme for nails - which include Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C - will prime, brighten and smooth nails. It recommend applying two coats to bare nails to keep them hydrated and protected from UV rays. This should delay the process of nails becoming brittle as they age. It is not intended to be used as a basecoat or topcoat with nail polish - but presumably regular use would encourage a smooth base for when varnish is applied. Banish brittle nails: The new product promises to make nails look smoother and brighter . If you decide to keep your nails unpainted, the creme will give them a 'natural glow'. But when we've already got facial wrinkles and greying, thinning hair to fret about, do we really need to worry about the effect of ageing on the appearance of our nails too? Yes, says beauty blogger Really Ree who has welcomed the arrival of the product. She writes: 'Personally, I get very excited by the way that skincare approaches are being applied to much more than just our skin. We can now have the same care for hair and nails too. 'I am thinking that a BB Cream for teeth is either on its way, or already exists. I have always wanted to look after my hair like I look after my skin, and it makes sense to do the same with nails too.' She added: 'I have accepted that my hair ages just like my skin does, and I think I have always known that nails age, too. I just never really thought about trying to stop them.' Shreya Patel, an expert at vanityvan.co.uk says that condition of our nails can say a lot about the rest of our body and we should be concerned about them ageing. 'Just as the body ages, nails do too. Changes are apparent in the skin, nails (fingers and toes) and hair. Just think of why doctors always examine your nails, or when you go into surgery.. They give away a lot.' Shreya says that spotting signs of aging in your nails can be easier than it sounds and there are a few obvious things to look out for. 'Nails becoming brittle and change colour, the clarity on the nail is affected, while vertical ridges can form, and they become thinner and break more easily. They look drier and take longer to recover from any injury like bruising.' Shreya believes that the ORLY BB Crème is a real innovation and could dramatically help change the health of our nails. 'There is nothing of this intensity on the market and why shouldn't there be? There are BB creams for the face - nails are also susceptible and people take them for granted. 'This is a  genius product for plumping the nail structure, whitening so to avoid the discolouration that comes with ageing, brightening so they look great with no nail varnish - even though it has a pearlescent sheen so can be worn alone. 'It also has smoothing and anti chip properties which, in the long run, will help people whose nails have been damaged by cheap nail enhancing, ageing and illness. Did I forget to mention it protects your nails from UV rays.'

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Forget the races, for many Royal Ascot is all about the fashion. That's why Channel 4 have hired style guru Gok Wan to be their fashion correspondent as the glamorous event begins today. Clothes expert Gok will be on hand every day to comment on 'who's who' while appraising racegoers' outfits. Gok's fashion picks: He recommends, clockwise from left, colour-blocking with this vivid yellow number, eccentric prints, modern but still demure and chic lace and a dress and jacket combination for those who want to keep covered up . Attendees must adhere to traditional style rules including wearing skirts and dresses of a 'modest length', dress straps of one inch or greater (no strapless dresses allowed) and hats instead of fascinators. Gok said fashionistas can stick to the guidelines while still keeping their look on-trend. He said: 'My career is based on challenging . tradition, but it's all about taking classic stuff and twisting that. When you see women on Gold Cup Day and they're all parading along with . their avant-garde hats and the latest trends, it's all full of . tradition. 'The hemlines are to the knee, the arms are covered, there are . all these rules and regulations. At the same time, there are little . moments of new trends.' Style watch: Gok will be the fashion correspondent for Channel 4 at Ascot . This year, his pick of the trends are florals, monochrome and lace. He said: 'Modern florals ooze femininity. If you're . an hourglass, look for a dress that has a deep v-neck and synched-in . waist to make the most of those gorgeous, Marilyn Monroe curves.' He added: 'For an effortlessly glamorous, classic My . Fair Lady look, pick monochrome. If you're slim, a figure-hugging dress . which finishes on or just below the knee will knock 'em dead.' Jackets and pashminas are allowed in the Royal enclosure and Gok says they are a good option 'if you're worried about putting too much on show – or the British weather.' Ascot's official style guide stipulates no strapless dresses or fascinators for women and morning suits for men in the royal enclosure. Gok said you can stick to the rules whilst adding a personal twist . He also believes lace will continue to be a big trend at this year's event. He said: 'If the thought of lace makes you . think of your gran's net curtains, think again. There are loads of . gorgeous, modern laces out there which look effortlessly chic. And a . mesh or sheer material on the sleeves gives a beautiful hint of flesh . whilst also giving you some coverage.' When it comes to footwear, he said nude heels, like those favoured by the Duchess of Cambridge, are always a winner. Be bold: Gok recommends clashing patterns and bold prints like these seen in the official Ascot style guide . On trend: Gok said floral prints like this will be another winner . 'A heel will make your legs look gorgeous . and a pointy toe will make your pins look even longer. Every woman . should own a pair of black or nude heels – they'll go with everything,' he recommends. But Gok's style tips aren't just for women. While he said men are more restricted in the Royal Enclosure on how adventurous they can be with their outfit, there are ways to make a morning suit reflect personal taste. Ahead of the trends: At last year's Ascot, the Queen showcased two of the looks Gok recommends will be big this year - colour-blocking, left, and floral print, right . Never out of fashion: Gok said nude heels, like those seen on the Duchess of Cambridge when she went to Derby Day at Epsom with Princes William and Harry in 2011, are a wise choice . He said: The only things you can use to express . yourself are your shirt-and-tie combination, and then your cufflinks. And then it's more hidden moments - the lining of your waistcoat or your . jacket – it's all about hidden personality.' The TV presenter said wearing a morning suit to front the Ascot fashion coverage will be an unusual experience for him. Take a chance: Of course you can get it wrong, but with clashing patterns, bright colours and bold prints a-plenty, chances are you will probably nail it. So be daring and give it a go, you mightjust surprise yourself! Get your underwear right: Get your foundations right and everything else should fall into place. Get the support you need in all the right places because that's the last thing you want to worry about on the day! Size matters: The fit of your clothing has to be right. If you are literally tied up like a turkey ready for basting, you're going to be uncomfortable. Be on trend: There's going to be a lot of monochrome and quite a lot of colour clash. Floral prints are a huge trend throughout the whole of the summer as well. It's going to feel very beautiful English garden. Of course, there will be the big-brimmed hats as well and this season we've gone very clean and neat with our tailoring, and we've put that on to prints as well. So expect to seeloads and loads of sharp lines. Royal Ascot is live on Channel 4 from June 17 – 21 and includes seven QIPCO British Champions Series races .","Style guru is Channel 4's fashion correspondent at this year's Ascot .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Forget Tiger Mothers, the pushiest parents in the world are those who want their children to be the best in the cutthroat world of modern dance in the U.S. British viewers will get the chance to see just how competitive the pastime is when the new series of Dance Moms airs on Lifetime next week. The reality TV show goes behind the scenes at Pittsburgh's renowned Abby Lee Dance Company, owned and operated by the formidable Abby Lee Miller. Checking up: The 'dance moms' watch as their children rehearse . Looking for the best: Dance teacher Abby Lee Miller, right, watches the girls perform . No sugar-coating: Miller isn't afraid to tell the children what she really thinks of their dancing . Competitive: The girls (and their mothers) are desperate to be the best . Best behaviour: How the mothers act can influence whether Miller gives their daughter a starring role . Miller is so determined to find the best dancers, she pushes children to be the best they can be - and doesn't spare their feelings if she thinks they are not up to scratch. Her appraisals of auditions make Simon Cowell look soft. She uses phrases such as 'only number one is good enough!' and 'quit that crying cr**!' when the children perform. Miller says: 'I'm not looking for somebody to be second place. I want a member who stretches every night before they go to bed, I want kids who can learn a routine in one day and compete the next. I want it all.' She adds: 'I want kids that want it, that want to be the best they can be.' At war: The dance moms compete with one another to help their daughters get ahead . Looking older than their years: The girls wear make-up and have perfectly groomed hair for their performances . Practise makes perfect: The boys and girls perfect their moves . Children can learn to dance at the Company from the age of two but Dance Moms follows a troupe aged eight and above who are competing to win coveted awards in solo and group categories. Their routines must be flawless with an appearance to match. Sequined outfits, tonnes of make-up and perfectly groomed hair are all de rigueur. And as the title of the show suggests, behind every girl vying to be number one, is a mother pushing them all the way. This leads to bickering, back-stabbing and tantrums - all from the mothers. 'It's not fair! You get special treatment for your daughter!' says one of the mothers in the opening episode as they fall out over who Miller has selected to do the latest dance solos. Pick me! The dancers compete for places in solo and group routines . In or out: Miller's decision is final when it comes to picking dancers for important performances . High standards: The dancer instructor is looking for girls who stretch every night and want to be the best . The girls are told: 'Second place isn't good enough' Support: The mothers are there for every rehearsal and show . It seems the mothers have to fight one another to get their child ahead - as if they pick their battles with Miller, it's their child who will be punished. One mother learns this at her daughter's cost at an open audition in Florida in the opening episode. When she tells Miller her daughter didn't dance well because she didn't hear the initial instruction to start on her left foot, the child is immediately dropped. 'Who is your daughter? You just humiliated her stage in front of all these people, she's out,' Miller shouts dismissing the heartbroken young girl from the competition. One of the experienced 'dance moms' then tells the outspoken mother: 'A word of advice, don't speak out against Abby, she hates it when you stand up for your kid.' As the mothers can't win against Miller, they wage war on one another instead. In the first episode of series four, which airs on Monday on Lifetime, they accuse one another of trying to sabotage one another's daughter's routines or trying to win Miller's favour by buying her gifts. Expect high kicks and even higher drama as the girls dance ever closer to the National Dance titles in spite of their mothers' backstage breakdowns on Dance Moms, Lifetime, from Monday 16th June at 9pm .","Reality TV show goes behind the scenes at U.S. Abby Lee Dance Company .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Actress Gwyneth Paltrow is famed for her clean living and healthy eating. From kale to quinoa, the mother-of-two is all for foods that are nutritious and natural. Now, along with her team at Goop, she wants to help other people convert to her low-fat living. In the latest edition of her digital publication, the lifestyle guru has challenged people to send in their favourite recipe to see if she can make it super healthy. Healthy eater: Gwyneth Paltrow has written a book sharing her nutritious recipes . Gwyneth in the kitchen: The star wants to make meals more healthy . The Goop newsletter states: 'We love to . make food healthy - without sacrificing any of the taste. If you have a . favourite recipe that might just go a bit too heavy on the cheese, . cream, or butter, send it over: We'd love to take a crack at lightening . it up a bit.' The website already offers a number of low-fat meal ideas using healthy ingredients and promises to share their new meal makeovers based on readers' suggestions online. The need to find healthy alternatives to favourite dishes comes as Gwyneth, 41, revealed she has had to rethink her own diet recently. She wrote in the newsletter: 'A recent and very in-depth food sensitivity test revealed – surprise, surprise – that I'm sensitive to dairy, gluten, wheat, corn and oats, making breakfast all the more challenging.' Clean living advocate: The actress said she has noticed a difference in her health and appearance since she ditched sugar and dairy . The actress asked physician Dr. Frank Lipman to give her some meal ideas and he shared recipes for a 'green mojito smoothie' (which is alcohol free of course), a veggie omelette and a chai seed pudding. As well as encouraging people to ditch fat, Gwyneth is an advocate of sugar-free diets. In the introduction of her recipe book It's All Good, published in 2012, she revealed how a doctor advised her to avoid sugar, dairy and processed foods because they were making her stressed out and ill. She said she noticed a transformation in her mood and energy levels after detoxing and switching to her superfood-rich diet. Having weaned herself off sugar, the latest Goop she reveals how to replace the ingredient in your diet with alternatives such as honey and stevia. Swap: On Goop, Gwyneth recommends simple replacements for sugar like honey . But while the Oscar-winning actress's advise on cutting back on sugar will resonate with many, other comments she has made recently have meant she's been held up as someone to ridicule rather than respect. First there was the way she announced her split from husband Chris Martin as a 'conscious uncoupling'. Then she compared her life in the limelight to being in a war because it is so 'dehumanising'. And most recently, she suggested water has feelings, writing, again on Goop: 'I am fascinated by the growing science behind the energy of consciousness and its effects on matter. 'I have long had Dr. Emoto's coffee table book on how negativity changes the structure of water, how the molecules behave differently depending on the words or music being expressed around it.'","Challenge made via Goop newsletter .

Footage uploaded to YouTube shows the leopard lying on its back in a cage while a keeper strokes its head. The animal - called Voodoo - sounds like it is in kitty heaven as it purrs loudly. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Not many people would be brave enough to give a leopard a head massage but this big cat loves it . Footage uploaded to YouTube shows the leopard lying on its back while a zoo keeper strokes its head . The leopard places its big paw on the zoo keeper's hand while he gives the animal a massage . Voodoo could pounce at any time but the zoo keeper is completely at ease as he gives the animal its morning massage. It is believed the leopard was being kept at Cedar Cove Feline Conservation Park in Louisburg, Kansas which provides refuge for big cats which have been abandoned, neglected or whose owners are unable to care for them. The video has been viewed nearly one million times on the video sharing website. Leopards are graceful and powerful big cats closely related to lions, tigers, and jaguars. They live in sub-Saharan Africa, northeast Africa, Central Asia, India, and China. However, many of their populations are endangered, especially outside of Africa. The leopard is so strong and comfortable in trees that it often hauls its kills into the branches. By dragging the bodies of large animals aloft it hopes to keep them safe from scavengers such as hyenas. Leopards . can also hunt from trees, where their spotted coats allow them to blend . with the leaves until they spring with a deadly pounce. Leopards are graceful and powerful big cats closely related to lions, tigers, and jaguars . Tickled: The leopard looks delighted to be given a massage by the zoo keeper . Leopards are normally found living in sub-Saharan Africa, northeast Africa, Central Asia, India, and China . These nocturnal predators also stalk antelope, deer, and pigs by stealthy movements in the tall grass. When human settlements are present, leopards often attack dogs and, occasionally, people. Leopards are strong swimmers and very much at home in the water, where they sometimes eat fish or crabs. Female leopards can give birth at any time of the year. Many leopard populations are endangered, especially outside of Africa . They usually have two grayish cubs with barely visible spots. The mother hides her cubs and moves them from one safe location to the next until they are old enough to begin playing and learning to hunt. Cubs live with their mothers for about two years—otherwise, leopards are solitary animals. Most leopards are light colored with distinctive dark spots that are called rosettes, because they resemble the shape of a rose. Black leopards, which appear to be almost solid in color because their spots are hard to distinguish, are commonly called black panthers.","Footage uploaded to YouTube shows the leopard lying in a cage .

"By . Tara Brady . The wife of Cameroon's vice prime minister has been kidnapped and at least three people were killed in an attack by the Islamic militant group Boko Haram. The kidnapping took place early yesterday morning in the town of Kolofata, in the far north region of Cameroon, according to the communications minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary. He said heavily armed fighters targeted the home of vice prime minister Amadou Ali as well as a local spiritual leader called Seini Boukar Lamine, who is also the town's mayor. Scroll down for video . Armed fighters targeted the home of vice prime minister Amadou Ali (pictured) kidnapping his wife . Boko Haram, the Nigerian Islamist . militant group, has stepped up cross-border attacks into Cameroon in . recent weeks because the country has deployed troops to the region, . joining international efforts to combat the militants. Some people were killed during the attack but it is not yet known exactly how many. However, the minister confirmed Mr Ali's wife was among those kidnapped. Cameroon's . government has become increasingly involved in regional efforts to . combat Boko Haram, despite warnings from the armed group to stay out of . its fight with the Nigerian military or risk further attacks. Yesterday's assault is the third Boko Haram attack into Cameroon since Friday. Members of Boko Haram, the Nigerian Islamist militant group, which has kidnapped the wife of Cameroon's vice prime minister . Meanwhile, some 22 suspected Boko . Haram militants, who have been held in Maroua since March, were on . Friday sentenced to prison sentences ranging from 10 to 20 years. Boko Haram have killed hundreds of people this year, mostly in northeastern Nigeria. The Nigerian Association of Witches and Wizards have now also declared war against the terror group. Cameroon has become involved in regional efforts to combat Boko Haram led by Abubakar Shekau (pictured) Spokesman for the group said it has held an emergency meeting to discuss a way forward. 'Witches and Wizards in Nigeria are deeply worried by what is going on in the country especially Boko Haram insurgency. 'As stakeholders in the Nigerian project, we can no longer afford to fold our hands while the nation burns. Enough is enough.' Dr Okhue Iboi said at the meeting. He made is clear that the days of the terrorist group were numbered and told parents of the missing school girls will be rescued. Earlier this month kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls who managed to escape from their Islamic extremist captors were reunited with the country's president. Still missing: About 250 schoolgirls were kidnapped in April by members of the militant group Boko Haram . President Goodluck Jonathan heard tales from some of the 57 who escaped after their abduction on April 15 before assuring them of his determination that those still in captivity ‘are brought out alive’. Around 57 students managed to flee shortly after they were captured, but a committee investigating their disappearance said 219 of the girls are still missing. According to a mediator working with Boko Haram two of the girls have died of snake bites while around 20 have fallen ill. The kidnapping took place early yesterday morning in the town of Kolofata, north Cameroon . Boko Haram is demanding a swap for detained fighters in exchange for the girls. Most of the schoolgirls are still believed to be held in the Sambisa Forest — a wildlife reserve that includes a mixture of thick jungle and open savannah. The forest borders on sand dunes marking the edge of the Sahara Desert. Sightings of the girls and their captors have been reported in neighboring Cameroon and Chad. Chibok and nearby villages are targets because they are enclaves of staunch Christians in predominantly Muslim north Nigeria.","The kidnapping took place early yesterday morning in the town of Kolofata .

"By . Tara Brady . This is the moment a group of lemurs scrambled down a tree and burst into a fantastic dance display which wouldn't have looked out of place in Saturday Night Fever. The primates had been eating berries from the top of the tall bark when they decided to cross a dirt road to a cluster of other trees. As they landed on the ground each one burst into an array of impressive dance moves, including twirls, jumps, spins and stretches . Staying alive: This lemur would give Tony Manero a run for his money on the dance floor . Boogie nights: One lemur looked like he was pulling the same moves as John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever . They boogied their way across the track without stopping and even performed a few acrobatic stunts. The elaborate routine only stopped when they reached another trunk and scrambled up to the top. The whole dance routine was captured on camera by Allison Buttigieg, who was watching the lemurs' antics with her boyfriend, Olli Teirila. The couple were enjoying a holiday on the island of Madagascar in the hope of photographing the dancing, made famous by the animated DreamWorks film. Throwing shapes: The lemurs boogied their way across the road and even performed a few acrobatic stunts . The lemurs scrambled down a tree before bursting into a fantastic dance display . Allison, 34, from Helsinki in Finland, said: 'Part of the reason I wanted to go to Madagascar is because they have lemurs there that look like they are dancing. 'We went to a spot where there were a group of them up in the trees and waited for many hours for them to move. 'Normally they jump from tree to tree but they had to cross a dirt road, so we were waiting for them to do that.

Moves like Jagger: Eventually the lemurs came down from the trees and started doing their little dance . Lemurs love to dance but they do not know how to crawl because they spend most of their day in the trees . Lemurs are an old group of primates which evolved after Madagascar split away from the African mainland . Smooth mover: Allison, 34, from Helsinki in Finland, took the photos of the dancing lemurs . 'Eventually they came down from the trees and started doing their little dance. ""They are adapted to the trees and they can't crawl so this is why they do it. ""I had seen them doing it on documentaries before and I had always said I wanted to go and see them for myself and take photos. 'It was very amusing and looked so funny, taking pictures was hard because I couldn't help but stop and just look at them as they did it. As there was no competition from monkeys on Madagascar, lemurs soon came to dominate its rainforests . Allison waited for hours for the lemurs to come down for trees so she could catch them dancing . 'I was ecstatic to get the photos as that was one of the main things I wanted to do, I was really happy.' Lemurs are an old group of primates which evolved in near isolation after Madagascar split away from the African mainland. They filled the ecological niches occupied by monkeys, the dominant primates, on mainland Africa. As there was no competition from monkeys on Madagascar, lemurs soon came to dominate its rainforests, until boats started to arrive around 2,000 years ago and human hunters arrived. Lemur size ranges from the world's smallest primate to - until fairly recently - some of its largest, the sloth lemurs, which rivalled gorillas in size. Ancient: Lemurs are named after the lemures (ghosts or spirits) of Roman mythology . Lemurs use their hands and feet to move nimbly through the trees, but cannot grip with their tails .","The whole dance routine was captured on camera by Allison Buttigieg .

With an army of celebrity fans, from Sienna Miller to Kate Winslet, plus an array of supermodels keen to hang one from their slender arm, Mulberry has long been the handbag of choice for the A-listers. And while the prices were always rather sky high,recently the high end fashion brand pushed up the cost of owning a Mulberry tote towards nearly £5,000 in a bid to tap into an even more exclusive luxury market. But the ploy for the big bucks simply hasn't worked and Mulberry have now revealed plans for an about turn and will launch a more affordable range in a bid to win back loyal customers. The news comes following a warning that its underlying annual profit would fall below expectations for the fourth time in two years. Change of tack: Mulberry, whose collaborators include model Cara Delevingne, has pledged to make its products more affordable. The luxury . goods firm said that profit before tax for the year ended 31 March 2014 . was now expected to be around £14million, while analysts had been . expecting around £19million. The . group, which is still looking for a new chief executive after last . month's departure of Bruno Guillon, said it will look to refocus its . sales efforts on offering products at more affordable prices. The new strategy was unveiled by former head Godfrey Davis, who oversaw the rapid growth of the Mulberry brand between 2002 and 2012. He has returned to the helm on a temporary basis until a permanent boss is found. The British luxury label enlisted Cara Delevigne to be their model of the moment. She designed and helped model a mini collection of bags including this signature camouflage backpack . Under former boss, Mr Guillon's leadership, Mulberry pushed up prices in an attempt to become even more exclusive, with products such as the Bayswater and Alexa handbags selling for up to £4,500. However, the increase in prices alienated the company's core customer base, triggering a slew of profit warnings. Creative director Emma Hill also resigned from the group last year amid speculation over disagreements with Mr Guillon. Mulberry model and designer Cara Delevigne showcased two of her mini collection at London's Claridge's . Following her appointment in 2008, Ms Hill was credited with transforming the company into an international fashion powerhouse with a number of celebrity fans, including Kate Winslet and Sienna Miller.

Mulberry shares fell 4 per cent after today's latest profits warning and have more than halved in value since the start of 2013. In January, the group issued a profit warning after heavy discounting over Christmas in Britain and weak demand in South Korea dampened sales. In implementing a new strategy, Mr Davis warned that there will be a short-term 'material' negative impact on profits but it was necessary to ensure the future strength of the Mulberry brand. UK success: Emma Hill with her CBE . Disappointing sales: Mulberry has seen a drop in profit over the last 12 months. Davis said the firm will slow the rate of store openings from eight for 2013/14 to five for the 2014/15 financial year, in order to control costs and enable existing stores to gain traction. He added that Mulberry's new factory in Somerset, which opened in June, was now fully operational with more than 300 workers. The Bridgwater-based facilities were created thanks to £2.5million worth of investment from the Government's Regional Growth Fund with the hope of doubling Mulberry's UK capacity. Mr Davis said: 'Following the recent change in management, we are focusing on achieving sales growth through the reinforcement of our product offering at more affordable prices to meet the expectations of our loyal customers. 'This will have short term financial consequences but is necessary to ensure the future strength of the Mulberry brand,' he added. Owning a Mulberry handbag used to be the dream for professional young women. Smart . and stylish and just out of reach for most style-conscious . twenty-somethings, they would quietly covet the beautiful leather day . bags while saving for a wallet or purse from the brand. Then, in 2009, the game-changing Alexa arrived and suddenly Mulberry became the must-have label to be hanging from arms. Not for profit: Alexa Chung holding the bag Mulberry named after her, which is no longer a fashion must-have . This . was the height of the 'it' bag era and the classic British company used 'it' girl Alexa Chung to revamp and rebrand sending their sales figures . soaring. With prices . starting at £525 the bags were expensive but not completely . unaffordable, and a generation of young women skipped a rent payment or . two to get their hands on one of the range. Bosses . at the Somerset firm were of course, delighted, and celebrity-endorsed . product became a strategy to keep the cool, young, things coming back . for more. Celebrity favourites: Mulberry handbags, including . the Alexa (left), named after British fashionista Alexa Chung, and the .

The introduction . of the Del Ray, inspired by singer Lana Del Ray at London Fashion Week in February 2012 raised a few eyebrows as the then 19-year-old was relatively new on the . scene, but the fashion press lapped it up and sales continued to rise, . as did the confidence of the brand. So confident were they in fact, that they decided to start inflating prices to keep up with the high-end designer labels like Gucci, Tom Ford and Saint Laurent. The brand was now charging upwards of £1,000 for fast fashion items designed to appeal to a young market so it was no surprise when profit warnings began circulating. Stars including Downton Abbey's Joanne Froggatt (second left) and Elizabeth McGovern (centre), and socialite Olivia Palermo on the front row at the Mulberry show at London Fashion Week . The . penultimate nail in the coffin for . Mulberry's current sky-high pricing strategy was the departure of . creative guru Emma Hill. The city took a dim dim view of Hill's . departure. The response of Luca Solca, managing director of luxury at . investment company Exane BNP Paribas, was typical: 'Mulberry is trying . to reposition itself to the high end . . . Mulberry in my view should be . cheaper than Burberry and Gucci. 'There . is little choice for handbags between £250 and £600. Market results . indicate that Mulberry's upmarket ambitions are facing hurdles.' In . other words, Mulberry's price inflation was greed rather than good . sense. No one ever thought of it thinks of it in the Prada or Hermes . league, its appeal was something else. The final nail came in the . shape of model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne who designed the label's . latest collection after already being a face of the brand. Cara . is one of the world's leading models, but her fan base is young and . cool... and definitely doesn't have £1,500 to spend on a handbag. The . problem is that the women who do have £1,500 to spend on a handbag . don't want to wear a rucksack endorsed by a 21-year-old famous for her eyebrows and expanding tattoo collection.","Firm warns profits will disappoint for fourth time in two years, hitting shares 4% .

His £4m move from Southampton to Liverpool has been one of the stories of the summer, given it provided an unexpected opportunity for him to return to where it all began; the romance of a journey that began with heartbreak 17 years earlier coming full circle was there for all to see. Lambert is beaming as he sits in a meeting room in the plush Four Seasons Hotel, Liverpool’s base here in Boston, talking about how he is settling in when, in a flash, his tone changes and he takes a pin to the nostalgia and sentiment that has surrounded him. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Liverpool training ahead of Roma friendly . Here for a reason: Rickie Lambert says Brendan Rodgers signed him to score goals - not for sentiment . Old to new: Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish (left) speaks to Lambert during training at Harvard University . On the pitch: Lambert says his performances  for Southampton in recent seasons prove he is a worthy buy . ‘I know a lot of Liverpool fans like the idea of signing a Scouser and a Liverpudlian but the move had no sentiment about it,’ said Lambert, who has been entrusted with iconic No 9 shirt. ‘Football has no place for sentimental things. It’s about what I do on the pitch, it’s as simple as that. ‘It’s a good story and I’m happy talking about it but the time has gone past that now. The first game of the season is coming and believe me when I say it that is all I am focusing on. I want to get myself in the best shape possible. I know when I am fully fit, that is when you will see the best of me. ‘There are more signings to come, which is great for the club, but there is already a great squad here. You see the depth and quality and with a couple more signings, we are only going to be stronger.’ His words are as timely as they are wise. While it is clear the emotion surrounding this transfer is far removed from the vast majority of other deals, Lambert is smart to point out Brendan Rodgers did not sign him to be an on-field cheerleader - he was brought in to make a difference. Laughter: Lambert (left) is enjoying being back at the club who released him when he was 15 years old . Pride: Lambert says it will be an honour to wear any strip with a Liverpool FC badge on it . Competitive: Lambert challenges for the ball with Jordan Ibe during Liverpool training in the USA . This, after all, will be a hectic season for Liverpool, one that sees them return to the Champions League for the first time since 2009, and expectation will abound after they came within two points of winning the Barclays Premier League and Rodgers simply cannot afford to carry passengers. Determined characters like Lambert are what he needs. Those traits have been present ever since he was released by then Academy Director Steve Heighway in 1997, enabling him to climb the football pyramid, from the days when he was working in a beetroot factory to subside his fledgling career. ‘I’ll be honest - my career has been so long and been down so many different roads, I would be lying if I said that I had it in the back of my mind that I would ever return,’ said Lambert, who has played for, among others, Blackpool, Macclesfield and Bristol Rovers. 'It wasn’t a shock when I got released. I wasn’t one of the better ones in my group (Steven Warnock and Kevin Nolan were peers). I had only just been kept on six months earlier. I knew I was having to prove my place and keep working, so it didn’t really come as a surprise when they let me go. ‘When I look back, it was probably silly how much it hurt me because I was absolutely devastated. I was 15 and it felt like the end of the world. It was as simple as that. Boss: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers brought in Lambert to score goals for the club . Retired: Steven Gerrard (centre) trains after ending his involvement with the England national team . Sharp: Daniel Sturridge trains with the Liverpool squad at Harvard University in Massachusetts . ‘I’m 32 so the days of just being happy when I’m playing have gone. I’m looking at the bigger picture. It’s whatever is best for the club. Of course I don’t want to be on the bench and not play games but as long as I can see the manager appreciates me and my ability then I’m happy to do whatever. ‘I didn’t ask for any number. I was happy to be given any number. It is a special number and I was made up when they said you’re number 9. That [points to LFC badge] is what means the most to me. Any number with that on, I’ll be happy with it.’ With that, the beaming smile returns. Lambert will take another step towards gaining full fitness when Liverpool face Roma in the early hours of Thursday morning in Fenway Park and there is no doubt the enthusiasm he has for the club will improve his chances of seamlessly fitting in. ‘My first reaction at the time (when my agent rang) was something along the lines of “get lost”,’ said Lambert, referring to the phone call that turned his world upside down in May. ‘I didn't believe him at first. When I got out of bed properly and listened I realised it was genuine. ‘But now I have to get picked, progress with the club and impress the manager. That’s what matters. Obviously when I look back over my career I’ll never forget my time at all my clubs who mean a lot to me, but I’m thinking I have to think about what I do from now.’ Contemplating: Rodgers and Liverpool have a big seasonafter they finished second in the Premier League .

His performances had attracted the interest of Arsenal, who viewed Coleman as a potential replacement for Bacary Sagna, but Roberto Martinez first indicated on January 10 that the 25-year-old would be given improved terms.

Roy Hodgson is hatching a plan for a must-win clash with Montenegro and a flying young winger is central to his plans. Tottenham’s Andros Townsend is about to be thrust into the big time. On the same night in Serravale, the capital of San Marino, Raheem  Sterling is playing for England’s Under 21s in a Euro 2015 qualifier. He toils during a routine 4-0 win, exchanges words with team-mate Harry Kane over who should take a penalty and is eventually substituted after 65 minutes. What a difference six months makes: Raheem Sterling argues with Kane in an Under 21 match against San Marino . Meanwhile: Andros Townsend makes a name for himself in the senior match against Montenegro at Wembley . Job done: Roy Hodgson was delighted with his new star winger . Star man: But on Saturday night, Sterling lit up the World Cup with a fine match against Italy . When Sterling returns to England, he receives a call from Hodgson to join the senior squad for the final Group H fixture with Poland but it is purely for educational purposes. Townsend sparkled against  Montenegro, kept his place in the starting line-up and looked certain to go to Brazil. Not even Sterling’s biggest fan would have suggested back then that their respective roles would be reversed. The then 18-year-old was not playing for Liverpool, not thriving for the Under 21s and had been told by his club manager Brendan Rodgers to ‘stabilise his life’. Given Sterling, who grew up in the shadows of Wembley Stadium, had faced two separate court appearances in May and August last year (he was never prosecuted), his talent would go unfulfilled if he continued down a path littered with distractions. Liverpool had held Sterling in the highest esteem for an age. They paid an initial £600,000 to sign him from Queens Park Rangers in February 2010 when he was just 15 but as the nation started thinking about a trip to Brazil, all was not how it should have been. The evidence was clear. Between October 19 and December 1, Sterling played just seven minutes for Liverpool in the Barclays Premier League. The only trip he looked like making at that juncture was on loan somewhere, as thoughts of the World Cup seemed fanciful. Youngster: Sterling impressed at Liverpool after making the big switch from QPR as a teenager . Meant to be? Sterling went to Copland School, Wembley, within touching distance of the stadium . Confidence: Italy couldn't deal with the young star in the Group D game in Manaus . Now look at him. His performance against Italy in Manaus on Saturday evening was the latest, compelling proof that Sterling’s talent is  burgeoning and he could become a mainstay of this England team for the next three, maybe even four, World Cup campaigns. Blessed with scintillating pace, a sure touch and outstanding technique, his body strength should not be underestimated. His team-mates at Liverpool often talk of how robust he is in training and Italy midfielder Marco Veratti certainly received a jolt when they collided in Manaus. ‘He’s the toughest in our squad,’ says Liverpool and England  captain Steven Gerrard. ‘I don’t go near him in training because if I do, there is only one winner. He just needs to keep learning.’ That quality, more than any other, has been critical to his development these last seven months. Sterling, who has moved out of Liverpool city centre to a more conservative, tranquil area, has been pulled aside by his colleagues and told what he can achieve with concentration and dedication. It should also not be forgotten the role Rodgers has played in his development. Liverpool’s manager has been tough with him — one particular dressing down was broadcast in the TV documentary Being: Liverpool in 2012 — but he has also filled him with confidence and given Sterling a platform to thrive. Quality: Sterling has fought through the tough times at Liverpool to become a key performer . ‘I thought when Raheem (first) started he was outstanding,’ said Rodgers. ‘Then he had a real dip in his performances for a number of reasons. But I am always fair with players. I always try to act in the best interests of them, if they are performing in training and showing a real focus.’ That focus was evident in the  sweltering atmosphere of the Arena Amazonia on Saturday night. He served notice of what was in store with a thumping third-minute shot into the side-netting and played  a key role in the move that led to  Daniel Sturridge’s equaliser. And that performance brings this tale full circle. Another must-win World Cup game looms for Hodgson and the plan he will be hatching for Uruguay at the plush Royal Tulip hotel in Rio de Janeiro will again revolve around a flying young winger. Townsend’s time was in October but the present is about Sterling and there is little doubt he has the talent, tenacity and temperament to cope with whatever Uruguay throw at him and help maintain England’s interest in this tournament.","Six months ago Sterling was substituted in Under 21s game against San Marino .

Rickie Lambert's dream week will continue on Wednesday when he leads England’s attack in their penultimate World Cup warm-up in Miami as a Liverpool player. Lambert’s Anfield move will be confirmed on Sunday after he passed a two-part medical, which began at Spire Hospital in Mossley Hill at 9am on Saturday, then completed at the club’s Melwood training ground. A £4million fee with Southampton and terms for a two-year contract had already been agreed. Big chance: Rickie Lambert will start for England in their World Cup warm-up game against Ecuador . Waiting: Lambert was an unused substitute in England's 3-0 win against Peru on Friday . It was another whirlwind day for Lambert, 32, who travelled up to Merseyside after England’s 3-0 win over Peru on Friday night, then flew back to see his family on the south coast after the medical. Released by Liverpool at 15, he forged his career in the lower leagues. Lambert said: ‘The medical went well, but I can’t really say anything else. It has been a crazy couple of years.’ England step up their preparations for Brazil against Ecuador and boss Roy Hodgson is eager to give game time to those not heavily involved against Peru, which means Lambert will win his fifth cap. Hodgson handed Lambert his England debut last August, when the striker scored a header in a 3-2 win over Scotland, and hopes the move to Anfield further invigorates a career that has taken off at Southampton. Dream move: By that time Lambert will have completed a move to his boyhood club Liverpool . Dedication: Lambert is part of the 23-man England squad travelling to the World Cup in Brazil . Hodgson said: ‘I’m sure that when he plays against Ecuador you’ll see a fella’ running around with all the joy that his heart can muster. He’s very happy to be here with England and that the move has gone through to Liverpool. I congratulate him and I congratulate Liverpool on signing a good player.’ Liverpool already had five players in Hodgson’s 23-man squad but the deal for Lambert, and the pursuit of Adam Lallana, could take that figure to seven. Lallana would be allowed to undergo a medical in Miami this week if the Saints relent and accept Liverpool’s £25m offer. Lallana has his heart set on following Lambert to Anfield and wanted his switch to be completed before England’s World Cup campaign starts, but Southampton are digging their heels in. They rejected Liverpool’s £20m offer, made at the end of the season, then received a take-it-or-leave-it £25m bid on Friday night. Southampton will owe 25 per cent of whatever fee they receive to Lallana’s first club Bournemouth. Bayern Munich’s Xherdan Shaqiri has been lined up by Liverpool if the move for Lallana falters. Hodgson has sympathy for the Saints but added: ‘Good players are always going to gravitate to big clubs, that’s where the money is and that’s where the Champions League football is.’ Third in line: Lambert will be expected to provide competition for Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez at Liverpool . Highly-rated: Liverpool are also interested in Lambert's Southampton and Liverpool team-mate Adam Lallana .","Rickie Lambert to seal move to Liverpool on Sunday after passing medical .

The subject of coloured footwear has cropped up and has inadvertently led to him revealing his less than flattering nickname. ‘They call me “the referee” because I’m the only one who wears black boots these days,’ the Manchester United defender explains. ‘But I can’t be wearing those bright yellow ones, can I? It’s my job to kick the players wearing bright yellow boots, isn’t it?’ Cue fits of laughter. This is the first time Keane, who is with England’s Under-20s squad at the Toulon Tournament, has given an in-depth interview but the topic of what he puts on his feet gives an insight into his character. VIDEO Scroll down to watch 'Rio Ferdinand factfile: His clubs and trophies' Fill yer boots: England Under 20 defender Michael Keane hopes he can replace his idol Rio Ferdinand at United . Commanding: Michael Keane (L) helped England Under 20s secure a third-place play-off spot in Toulon . Keane has an old-fashioned approach, a player who enjoys hard work and puts the team first, never searching for compliments; those are values that will serve him well as he strives to put himself in the spotlight at Old Trafford. This is going to be a big season for the 21-year-old, who grew up idolising Sir Alex Ferguson’s all-conquering sides, particularly as there could be an opening under Louis van Gaal to advertise his talents. Should Van Gaal listen to advice from his new right-hand man, he will discover that Keane was in contention to make his first appearance in the Barclays Premier League the night Ryan Giggs, in his role as caretaker manager, gave youth its head against Hull City. ‘I was on the bench,’ said Keane, who had loan spells last season at Derby and Blackburn and made one of his two United starts in the League Cup against Aldershot. ‘I thought there was a chance that I was going to play but I was just happy to be involved. I’d have liked to have got on as I think I would have done well. End of an era: Rio Ferdinand (L) is considering his options after not being offered a new deal to stay . Dutch of class: Incoming United boss Louis van Gaal (R) is renowned for giving young players a chance . ‘I’ve heard the new manager likes to bring young players through and that’s always been the way at United. With Giggsy staying on, that can only benefit the young players. He’s an idol for every player that comes through. You see how professional he is and his enthusiasm for training every day no matter the fact he has played for 20 to 25 years at the top level. 'He comes in every day wanting to give his best. Hopefully, we’ll have a good pre-season and prove ourselves. If we do that, we’ll have a chance to play.’ There is quiet confidence in the way Keane — whose twin, Will, is also at United and in Toulon — speaks. Trying to fill the boots of Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand will not be easy task for whoever Van Gaal selects but Keane’s belief comes from advice the departing Ferdinand has given to him. Role model: Ryan Giggs is an inspiration to young players at United and almost gave Keane his debut . Hero worship! Michael Keane admits having Rio Ferdinand's name on his shirt as a youngster . ‘When I was young I always had Rio’s name on the back of my shirt,’ says Keane, one of four brothers who were brought up in Stockport. ‘Rio was my idol when he first joined United and he still is. Luckily, I’ve managed to train with him for a few years. He talks to everyone. England: Butland: Browning, M Keane, Moore, Garbutt; Chalobah, Ward-Prowse; Redmond, Foster-0Caskey, Obita; WoodrowWHERE: Parc de Sport, Avignon, 3.0pm Live on BT Sport 1 . ‘It’s sad to see him go. He was a great person to have around and he was great with the young lads. He speaks to everyone and always gives you advice. He talks to me about positional things. 'If I make a mistake in a game, he will ring me and tell me what I should do better. He wants to give you feedback. It was a surprise at first but now I just see him as a friend. I know I can go to him whenever I want. ‘Rio’s a really nice guy. Sometimes footballers get those type of reputations but he’s not like that at all. Behind the scenes there’s no one better to have around.’ Can he take his shirt, then? ‘I hope so,’ comes the reply. ‘That’s the dream. I still think I’ve got a chance of making it at United. While I still think I’ve got that chance I will stay and try to prove myself.’ On the spot: Michael's twin brother Will Keane (L) is also on the books at Old Trafford . Big things: England Under 20 coach Gareth Southgate insists that the Keane twins have a bright future . Before that, there is the pressing matter of helping England wrap up their first tournament in Toulon by grabbing third place. They play  Portugal this afternoon and Keane will be given the chance by Under-20 head coach Gareth Southgate to lead by example once again. ‘For Michael and Will, they would benefit from working with a coach like Van Gaal who will open their minds to different ideas,’ said  Southgate. ‘Michael is a player who can use the ball and is very comfortable at stepping out with the ball. He’ll be better for the experience here.’","Michael Keane hopes to replace idol Rio Ferdinand at Manchester United .

Jack Butland insists he is over his World Cup disappointment and believes the experience will help him realise his long-term ambition of becoming England No1. The Stoke goalkeeper called up to Roy Hodgson’s squad for Euro 2012 after John Ruddy suffered a late injury and he made no secret that he wanted to force his way into the England head coach’s plans for this summer’s trip to Brazil. At the European Championships in Israel 12 months ago, for instance, Butland had said that “Rio was on everybody’s minds” and repeated his aim last November. Experience: Jack Butland says he is enjoying his time in Toulon, and is over the World Cup disappointment . Always learning: The youngster has been called up to the national team but was snubbed for the World Cup . Butland, however, only played four . times for Stoke last season and was sent out on loan to Barnsley and . Leeds, with his international commitments limited to eight appearances . for the Under-21s in their Euro 2015 qualification campaign. As . a result, Butland, who will tonight captain the Under-20s against South . Korea in their latest assignment at the Toulon Tournament, accepts he . never gave Hodgson a serious decision to make about who would be . England’s third keeper in Brazil. ‘Going . to the World Cup would have been a fantastic experience,’ said Butland, . who will go loan again next season if Asmir Begovic remains at Stoke. ‘Not being a part of the World Cup has only given me more motivation and . drive to push on and be a part of the next European Championships. ‘I . can’t make a statement to myself if I’m not competing at the same level . as the guys who have gone. Deep down I’m gutted not to be going to the . World Cup as you always want to be part of major tournaments. ‘I . can’t sit here, be frustrated or hold a grudge. If I was playing well . in the Premier League then I could say “yeah, I can make a statement” but that hasn’t been the case. It’s a target (to progress) for next . season. ‘But coming here . has been beneficial. Facing top opposition will test us and help us if . we want to win the Euros next summer. Playing against these sides here . is massively important for our development. The players want to be . accustomed to playing against the top sides.’ Representing: Butland was No 1 for Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics in London . Losing . to Brazil in Saint-Raphael on Monday means England must beat South . Korea to stand a chance of qualifying for third-fourth place play-off . and the 21-year-old is praying for a better result than the last time he . faced the same opposition. That . was at the Olympic Games in 2012 and he was powerless to prevent South . Korea winning a tense penalty shootout at the Millennium Stadium 5-4; . the memory of failing to get near a single spot-kick still lingers. ‘The . standard of the penalties they took was superb,’ Butland recalled. ‘I . was devastated because it was a one-off competition. But you can’t dwell . on disappointments for too long. We have got to make sure we clinch . third-place here now. ‘It . would be massive to come in the top four of this tournament.

"By . Dominic King . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . Ask Ronald de Boer for his most vivid memories of Louis van Gaal and he is whisked back to De Meer, Ajax’s fabled old training base. This was Van Gaal’s domain, the setting where Manchester United’s new manager worked his magic; filling his players with confidence, plotting their path to glory and drilling passages of play that would become second nature on match days. It was also the place where Van Gaal would be fearsome and intimidating. The Dutch coach takes defeat as a personal affront and De Boer witnessed — as well as received — some of his most ferocious criticisms. Detail: Louis van Gaal drills his teams to know the opposition inside out, Ronald de Boer has said . Dominant Dutch: De Boer and Van Gaal, circled, won three Eredivisie titles together in the early 1990s . Few coaches in football have the ability to be as pugnacious as Van Gaal but De Boer, who played for him at Ajax and Barcelona, says he can make his players run through walls for him. In short, United have a man primed to deliver success. ‘Yes, he can be scary,’ said De Boer. ‘But that is because he is so passionate. He is 100 per cent all the time and he wants the same in return. You could see it on the sidelines but he could be even more intense on a Monday morning, especially if we’d lost. ‘If he knew that you hadn’t played well, he would be straight on top of you. He is a big guy, he wants to win and that is where he can be intimidating and intense. But even if he shouts at you, he will listen to what you have to say. ‘He gives players chances to prove themselves. If you play badly in one game he won’t drop you straight away. He will give you the trust to repay him with a better performance next time. He puts trust in players but he expects it back from them. He doesn’t want to be let down.’ Success story: Ronald de Boer won the Champions League under Van Gaal at Ajax . Title winners: De Boer also won La Liga under Van Gaal's tutelage at Barcelona . Clearly, you do not win titles in Holland, Spain and Germany if your only attribute is being able to shout and De Boer — key to the Ajax side which Van Gaal steered to Champions League success in 1995 — has given an insight into his old manager’s forensic attention to detail. ‘He would say sometimes to Marc Overmars, “The guy you are playing against drifts across to be close to the central defender. Stay where you are and you will get in behind him,” — and he’d be right,’ said De Boer. ‘It was the same with Jari Litmanen. “Jari, the defender who is marking you sometimes thinks he is a holding midfielder also. Don’t move when he does. Let him go five yards.” Jari would do that, the chance would come and he’d score. It was like he was seeing things before anyone else. ‘He is so well prepared that you would be doing drills in training and you would know what the opposition were going to do before they did. You knew exactly what you were up against.’ So how will he inspire, for example, Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney after last season when they so often misfired alongside each other? ‘He has got some great players there,’ observed De Boer, who was capped 67 times by Holland. ‘He wants them to be excellent in everything they do. If you do it the way he wants he will be your best mate.’ Serial winner: De Boer claimed Van Gaal's desire to come out on top was intense and intimidating .

"By . Dominic King . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . They call it 'the place where stars are born' and a glance at the cast of notable graduates confirms that is no idle boast. The Toulon Tournament is maybe unique, given it is not affiliated to UEFA or FIFA, entry is by invitation only and games are 80 minutes long. But its propensity for being a breeding ground for world-class players, like Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry and Cristiano Ronaldo is beyond dispute. It is a competition that was also once part of England’s fabric. They were victorious four times between 1990 and 1994 — Sportsmail’s Jamie Redknapp captained one successful squad, while Alan Shearer and David Beckham also played — and on Thursday night, after a nine-year absence, a team of Young Lions will set out to prove they can be the names of tomorrow. Challenge: Nathan Redmond and his England Under-21 colleagues will take part in the prestigious Toulon Tournament . Looking ahead: Gareth Southgate wants his players to develop into stars of the 2022 World Cup . Nice one: Redmond is congratulated after scoring the first goal in England's 3-1 win against Wales . In some respects, it is fitting England’s opponents are Qatar as it will be in the Middle East, in 2022, that many of the youngsters in Gareth Southgate’s 20-man squad will be at their peak when the ambition, mapped out by FA chairman Greg Dyke, is to conquer the world. That, of course, is a dream but the reality of the next two weeks is that this is a crucial part of their development, one that will provide a number of different tests. After Qatar, England face holders Brazil, South Korea and last year’s finalists Colombia. Put simply, England could do everything that Southgate asks of them but it still might not be enough to get out of Group B. ‘The chairman has gone on record saying he wants us to be a force at the World Cup in 2022,’ said Southgate. ‘We will be looking at the lads here to form the nucleus of that squad.Our players will get to experience all the things that come with playing tournament football against teams from all over the world. ‘Of course, we want to go and win but, if we don’t, the learning side of things is invaluable.’ Southgate stresses that point and it is . little wonder. England’s Under-21s have sauntered through their Euro . 2015 qualifying group, winning seven of their eight games with little . fuss, but each one has been the same: England attack, opponents sit deep . and hope to hold out for as long as possible. Talent: Thomas Ince (left), who is close to joining Inter Milan, gets away from Wales' Tom O'Sullivan . Convincing: England eased to a comfortable 3-1 in a European Championship qualifier against Wales on Monday . Many will expect Qatar to do the same but a glance at their squad suggests England will be in for a shock if they are complacent. Abdullah Ali, for instance, is on Real Madrid’s books; Tameem Al Muhaza is with Atletico Madrid, Sultan Al Blake plays for Monaco, while four Qataris are at Villarreal. ‘It will be really interesting to play them,’ said Southgate. ‘They are quite free in how they play but if we take liberties we will get punished. Qatar have investment and they are building a side for 2022.’ As are England. The journey starts now.","England's Under-21 side will compete in the Toulon Tournament in France .

Should he do that, Everton will inevitably find clubs being attracted to the 20-year-old but they have plans of their own to renew his contract this summer and, according to Martinez, no offer would persuade them to do an about-turn. ‘It would be wrong for him (to leave this summer),’ said Martinez. ‘I always feel as manager you develop a relationship with players and you’re always honest with that. Ross is a phenomenal talent, probably the best English talent I have ever seen, but he is not the finished article yet. ‘It’s our duty to protect him and I know Everton is the perfect place for him for the next 12 months.

On target: Barkley scored six Premier League goals for Everton in his first season in the team . One of Barkley’s biggest attributes is his ability of not allowing big occasions to affect him and Martinez expects his reputation to be dramatically enhanced if things turn out the way Everton’s manager envisages. ‘He’s playing at a World Cup and he could be in a position to impress millions never mind just the people in England,’ said Martinez. ‘That’s the type of tournament we are talking of. But Ross will never look at it in that way, he will look at it and try to be as good as he can to help England. ‘Ross will come back the same person I can guarantee you that.

"By . Kit Holden . Per Mertesacker was irritated after the victory over Algeria. His post-match rant at a TV reporter has since gone viral. At one point, the Arsenal defender told his victim: 'I don’t know what you want from me'. The comment summed up Germany’s World Cup. Before this tournament, all the talk was of results, and results alone. It was all very well playing lovely, revolutionary football, people said, but where were the trophies? Where was the German efficiency of yesteryear? Now, Low’s team have rediscovered that efficiency, people are asking where the beautiful football has gone. No wonder Mertesacker was confused when he asked: 'would you rather we played nicely and got knocked out?' VIDEO Scroll down for highlights from Germany's qualifying . Hitting out: Mertesacker (right) did not respond well to criticism from one journalist . Steady as she goes: Low's side have not blown anyone away since their opening 4-0 win against Portugal . VIDEO Brazil will raise their game - Loew . Germany have certainly failed to make viewers gasp in Brazil as they did in South Africa. Gone are the breathtaking counter attacks and the endless goals; replaced by a more possession based game which Low has honed over the last few years. With the exception of Portugal, Germany are no longer destroying teams like they did four years ago. Over the last few weeks, there has been many a wistful newspaper column, longing for the 'Hurrah football' of 2010. Many blame Low’s tactics, saying he is too obsessed with innovation, too rigid in his quest for modern football. There are other reasons though. In 2010, teams still believed they could outplay Germany. They were punished for that belief. Now, opponents defend. Germany are forced to scrap, to be ruthless and efficient. Spain suffered the same issue in 2010, winning many games 1-0, but ultimately claiming the title. Having a ball: Mats Hummels (centre) shares a joke with his team-mates in training on Monday . Nonetheless, the trend is to blame Low. Most say he has no Plan B, while also complaining that he is constantly coming up with new ideas. Whether he plays Philipp Lahm at right back or in midfield, he is criticised for it. If his team plays nice football, people want efficiency. If they play efficiently, people want nice football. He is stuck. But if he wins the World Cup, all will be forgiven. The trophy itself is all that matters this summer. Wolfgang Niersbach, head of the German FA, told the Tagesspiegel on Tuesday that Germany’s place in the FIFA rankings was proof enough of their success in recent years. He is the only one who believes that now. Low has now had three shots at winning a major tournament, all of them unsuccessful. This is probably his last chance. At every round of this tournament, fans and media alike have been speculating that he might leave - an inconvenience he always used to be spared. Captain fantastic: Philipp is equally adept deployed in midfield or at full back . VIDEO All Star XI: Philipp Lahm highlights . The German FA may declare their full faith in Low, but if Germany do fail this time, having played as they have, it will be fatal for his reputation. This time, he will have failed to win, and failed to entertain. As for the next hurdle on the way to glory, Germany know that Brazil is the biggest challenge yet. They are not letting Neymar’s injury allow them to be complacent. 'We know we will come up against a strong Brazilian team. They are hard, they play differently these days,' warned Bastian Schweinsteiger this week. They also know that they have more quality than Brazil, but it is not the players Germany fears. It is the manager. Just as the country has no faith in their own coach, they are fearful of his Brazilian counterpart. In the only other World Cup game between these two countries, the final of 2002, it was Scolari who led the Brazilians to victory. Schweinsteiger described him as ""our biggest opponent"" before Tuesday’s game. Revenge mission: Germany lost the 2002 World Cup final 2-0 to Brazil . Back home, the game is approached with more caution than expectation. Since 2006, both the German team and the German fans have seen the World Cup as a party. They have relaxed, done their own thing, and enjoyed the show. This year, the joy has been dampened slightly. Where before, Germany games were greeted with excitement and euphoria, now they are greeted tentatively. For both the fans and the team, the freedom and the excitement is gone. It has been replaced only by grim determination to finally win the World Cup again. Going for glory: Germany know they are just two wins away from lifting the World Cup .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A new range of milk that claims to prevent digestive problems such as bloating and nausea is being launched in the UK. Up to 20 per cent of Britons say they can’t tolerate dairy products because of the side-effects they cause. The best-known form of milk intolerance in the UK is lactose intolerance, but research published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggests less than a third of cases can be attributed to this. Up to 20 per cent of Britons say they can't tolerate dairy products because of the side-effects such as bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea and/or constipation . In the study of 406 randomly recruited men and women, 20 per cent reported abdominal discomfort after eating dairy foods, but only six per cent had lactose intolerance diagnosed by a doctor. Instead, many people who struggle to digest milk may be intolerant to a protein called A1 found in regular cows’ milk. a2 Milk, an Australian brand which has just launched in the UK, claims to come from specially-selected cows whose milk is free from the A1 protein. By avoiding this particular protein, the manufacturer says it may be possible for many of those who suffer side-effects such as bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea and/or constipation to consume milk. a2 Milk claims to come from specially-selected cows whose milk is free from the A1 protein that may cause the symptoms . It’s thought that the A1 protein in milk – which has been linked with a range of symptoms associated with digestive function – digests differently to the A2 protein. ‘Many people assume if they suffer from . bloating, abdominal pain or nausea after drinking milk they have lactose . intolerance,’ said Melanie Bibby, a registered nutritionist and . nutrition manager for a2 Milk UK. ‘But in many cases, this may in fact be a reaction to a protein in milk called A1.' She added that the symptoms cause many people to cut milk out of their diets completely. ‘Not only is this an added hassle to everyday life but it means that thousands are missing out on the high levels of calcium and other beneficial nutrients found in cows’ milk.’ Although an Australian brand, a2 milk comes from British cows. Those that naturally produce milk rich in the A2 type of beta-casein protein are identified using a non-invasive DNA test which analyses a sample hair from the tail of each dairy cow. These cows are then separated to form A2 herds. ‘While a2 Milk isn’t suitable for people who have been diagnosed with milk allergies or lactose intolerance, it’s a great option for those who suffer from an A1 milk protein intolerance,’ said Ms Bibby. A two-litre bottle of whole or semi-skimmed a2 Milk costs £1.99. It is available in selected Budgens and Morrisons and large Tesco stores as of next week.","A fifth of Britons say milk causes symptoms such as bloating, stomach cramps and nausea .

"By . Amanda Williams . Tory councillor Barbara Driver has sparked outrage by saying 'when rape is inevitable, lie back and enjoy it' during a council meeting . A Tory councillor has sparked outrage by saying 'when rape is inevitable, lie back and enjoy it' during a council meeting. Barbara Driver had used the phrase in an attempt to describe how powerless planners are to control a housing development. She said: 'There is a saying and I am going to say it: When rape is inevitable, lie back and enjoy it.' She is now stepping down from Cheltenham Borough Council after her comments were branded 'repulsive'. The 77-year-old - who last year lead a report looking at sexual exploitation - has apologised. Speaking from her home she said: 'Unfortunately it was wrong what I said. By no way do I condone rape - it is atrocious. 'I was trying to put across - badly I will say - the fact of developers having not put much social and affordable housing in and the council saying we can’t do anything about it. 'But I used a term that I had heard years ago without thinking. It was totally dreadful. it was done without thinking about the rape bit. I know that sounds silly.' Liberal Democrat councillor Peter Jeffries, lead member for safeguarding, said: 'I think she let herself down and she let the council down. 'It was an atrocious thing to say in the middle of a meeting about housing.' Fellow Lib Dem councillor Rowena Hay said she was shocked - especially since Driver lead a report looking at sexual exploitation in Cheltenham just last year. She said: 'It is not something I would expect to hear from an experienced councillor in a public meeting that was extremely well attended, particularly from Barbara Driver who championed and lead the sexual exploitation working group. 'I think the most shocking thing for me is that it trivialises those people who have been through rape and the crisis that causes in those people’s lives. 'Barbara is an extremely hard working councillor and I would never take that away from her. 'Trying to get victims of domestic violence and rape taken seriously has taken years. To have somebody diminish that is just beyond belief.' She made the comments during a debate on plans to build 30,000 homes in Tewkesbury, Cheltenham and Gloucester on Wednesday and it is understood the councillor was comparing rape to a developer’s ability to tell a council how many affordable homes it is willing to build on a specific site. Karen Clarke, from the Gloucestershire Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre, criticised the remarks.She said: 'Making these comments, that have nothing to do with what she was talking about, is quite shocking. 'Rape has a devastating impact and there’s no possibility that anyone could ever lie back and enjoy it. 'When people in positions of power make throw away and flippant comments like this it perpetuates the myths around rape. She is now stepping down from Cheltenham Borough Council after her comments were branded 'repulsive' 'Someone in a position of authority should know better. Apologies are not enough.' Three official complaints have been made prompting the referral of the matter to the council’s monitoring officer who will consult with two independent advisors. A Cheltenham Borough Council spokeswoman added: 'The council has taken the matter seriously, as has Councillor Driver, and a full and sincerely apology has been issued to the mayor and copied to all councillors'. Councillor Driver has also apologised in an open letter to the council in which she said her remark was 'completely inappropriate and thoughtless and should not have been said'. She added yesterday: 'I was thinking more about the control - the developers having control over what goes on and the council trying to take back control. 'I didn’t mean to hurt anyone.' When asked to respond to those who have called for her resignation she said: 'That is there right, to say that if that’s what they think. 'But I’ve had also quite a few people saying yes you shouldn’t have said it but please don’t go anywhere.'","Barbara Driver used phrase to explain how powerless planners are .

"By . Paul Hirst . Luiz Felipe Scolari is convinced Brazil can beat Germany and make it through to a dream World Cup final despite Neymar’s absence. Brazil will take on Germany at the Estadio Mineirao on Tuesday without their best player and leading scorer, who was ruled out of the World Cup after fracturing a verterbrae in last week’s win over Colombia. An incredible wave of sadness followed the news that Neymar had been ruled out. Scroll down for videos... Motivation: Luiz Felipe Scolari has called for Brazil to win the World Cup for injured Neymar . The players shed tears and many of the 200 million football-mad Brazilians feared how their team would cope without their talisman. But Scolari has moved on from the incident and he has challenged the rest of his squad to reach the Maracana final for their injured star. 'He has done his share. Now it’s up to us to do our share,' the Brazil coach told a press conference on the eve of the match. The end? Neymar broke a vertebra in his back after a challenge by Colombia's Juan Zuniga . 'This match we’ll be playing not just for ourselves but for our country, for everything we’ve ever dreamed of, but also for Neymar and everything he’s done for us. 'Within our group, we’ve accepted that. We’ve left our sad phase behind and we’re focusing on other things.' Scolari had asked Neymar to come to Belo Horizonte for the semi-final, but a spokesman for the Brazil football confederation said the forward would not attend the match and would instead continue his recuperation in Sao Paulo. Despair: Brazil's hopes of winning the World Cup have been severely dented by Neymar's loss . Scolari used several different replacements for Neymar and he also changed his formation during training, presumably to keep the gathered media and the Germans guessing about how his team would line up in Belo Horizonte. Willian and Bernard are the two leading contenders to fill Neymar's position, but Hernanes and Jo are two others who could be drafted in. Scolari rejected out of hand two opportunities to name his starting XI in his pre-match press conference. Mascot: Neymar was asked to attend the semi-final against Germany but has been flown home for treatment . Whoever he does pick, Scolari is sure they will be up to the task. 'Neymar is one of our references and one of the best players in the world, but we have another 22 players who have been hand-picked and capped because we know they are special,"" the former Chelsea manager added. 'Those guys who come in are special. They can make a big difference. 'This is what we are conveying to our players. We will miss Neymar, but we have a team who can overcome the difficulties and go on into the next round. 'That's the goal the group has had since the beginning: to qualify for the final.' Hair raising! Willian is one possibility to replace Neymar for Brazil's semi-final showdown . Scolari admitted he could deploy three defensive midfielders against the Germans to counter the threat of players like Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thomas Muller and Mario Gotze. Operating with three deep midfielders would go against Brazil's tradition of all-out attack, but Scolari has told the nation to trust him in what he is doing. 'Playing with three defensive midfielders is an option,' he said. 'If I have two players in there, the full-backs will have less freedom but I might be able to add something that imposes a bit more damage on Germany too.' Park the bus? Brazil may use three defensive players to combat Bastian Schweinsteiger and Germany's midfield . Brazil topped their group, but they were inconsistent in their first three matches. They then almost exited the tournament in the following round but won a nail-biting penalty shootout against Chile. However, Brazil finally lived up to their billing in Fortaleza last week during a thrilling first-half display in which Colombia were blown away. Neymar's absence, and the step up in opposition, mean Scolari should feel under more pressure than ever. But if the engaging Brazil coach is nervous in any way, he was not letting it show on the night before the game. 'I sleep very well,' the jovial coach said with a grin. Grin and bear it! Luiz Felipe Scolari was in a relaxed mood at the press conference . 'The easiest thing for me is to put my head down and sleep. 'I have a fantastic group of players and we have been watching Germany's games too. 'We've had scouts at their last two matches and our scouts have instructed us how we can beat them. 'When you have a team working with you, a team of assistants, you feel more at ease making choices. 'I know the starting line-up. Tomorrow, when they walk on to the field, you will see why I made those choices. 'I want to tell the Brazilian people: we're doing our best, and doing what we think is necessary. 'Sometimes not in a very beautiful way, but we're moving forward. One step at a time towards the final.' Same again? The Brazil coach doesn't want to taste disappointment after bringing home the World Cup in 2002 . The last time Brazil won the World Cup was 12 years ago, when Scolari led the Selecao to victory over Germany. Scolari has since tasted defeat against the three-time world champions with Portugal, so he wants to get back to winning ways in the semi-final. 'We won in 2002 with Brazil but I lost in 2008 with Portugal. And then I lost the third/fourth place play-off in 2006, also with Portugal, so I have two defeats and one victory, he said. 'In order to tie this up I have to win tomorrow, so I hope Brazil play well, win and the memories are very good.'","Luiz Felipe Scolari has called for Brazil to win the World Cup for Neymar .

'Looking back at other tournaments, it was the case of trying to progress and go through. This time around, it has been a clear approach of: let's try to be ourselves, let's try to find solutions and learn from the experience for the future; if we progress in this tournament, great, if not we'll get the benefits. 'There is a real legacy growing in this new England set-up. 'I love the eye-to-eye mentality and having a really brave outlook about their performances. 'The defeat against Uruguay was marginal.

And the 27-year-old has revealed that he scored twice against England last week while suffering from exhaustion and cramps.

VIDEO All Star XI: Luis Suarez . Injured: Suarez revealed he was only 50 per cent fit during Uruguay's victory over England . 'I was not really 100 per cent fit and sometimes this happens,' he said. 'I was the other day really at the limits of my physical capacity, as I was for the last match with Liverpool last season. 'Last week I was full of cramps and I was tired but of course you have a certain experience and you can build yourself up and come to the next assignment and this is what I am doing. 'I am building myself up again for the game against Italy.' Suarez had knee surgery at the end of the Barclays Premier League season and didn't feature in Uruguay's first game here, a defeat to surprise package Costa Rica in Fortaleza. But he returned to feature against England and scored twice - the winner coming in the 85th minute - to effectively dump Roy Hodgson and his players out of the competition. After that game Suarez re-ignited his feud with the English media, who he feels have not portrayed him fairly during his various flirtations with controversy over the last three seasons. Asked about this by an English journalist during Uruguay's press conference on Monday, he said: 'You work in England, and that was in the papers. 'You should know what happened and I think it was nothing more than just in the papers. 'Everybody knows that in December 2013, I was elected the best player of the year. 'I guess this is very obvious and even the people in the Premier League voted for me and then if the papers vote for me as well that is sensational. 'I did not want to attack anybody, only some media started making fun of me and you are in the media. 'You are in the media, you should know what happened and why they did that to me.' It is clear that Suarez continues to feel that he is persecuted in the media in England and that will perhaps be a worry for his club Liverpool as they try to keep their star asset out of the clutches of clubs such as Barcelona and Real Madrid. Suarez signed a new contract at Anfield last season and Liverpool will be determined not to lose him. But it would appear that Suarez is far from happy with life in England. Halfway there: Suarez says the job is far from over for Uruguay and they must beat Italy to progress . ITALY (4-3-3): Buffon; Abate, Barzagli, Chiellini, Darmian; Cassano,, Pirlo, De Rossi; Insigne, Balotelli, Marchisio.URUGUAY (4-4-2) Muslera; Caceres, Giminez, Godin, A Pereira; Gonzal, Arevalo, Rodrigu, Lodeiro; Suarez, Cavani . On Tuesday in Natal, he will certainly play as Uruguay try to leave another major European nation feeling embarrassed. With England, Spain and, in all likelihood, Portugal going home after phase one, Italy will certainly be in danger if they don't lift their levels after the dismal defeat to Costa Rica last Thursday. Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez made no attempt yesterday to mask Suarez's importance. 'Luis is mature now, he has matured nicely and I have told him that,' said Tabarez. 'He is going to go out on to the pitch and he is going to fight. 'I trust him and he knows what to do in the last 20 metres in front of goal. 'You can't lose that, just because you have a meniscus operation. This is something you have from experience on the pitch. 'He put everything he could into overcoming this impediment. 'Having Luis alone does not make us favourites, but we have no doubt Luis's presence will be very important for us against Italy, 'Playing Italy is a gift sent from heaven above. That's the way we see it. 'If we win, it won' t be like winning just another match. It will be a victory against one of the best teams in the world.

Companies have poured  millions into advertising with England and their players only to see Roy Hodgson’s side exit within eight days. It has left some with the embarrassment of having  positive adverts still running on television, completely at odds with the national mood. VIDEO: Scroll down to see some of England's World Cup adverts . Costly advert: Mars paid big money to get Steven Gerrard, Danny Welbeck and Daniel Sturridge for their campaign . Just a dream: Gerrard scores a volley after a clever free-kick in the ad - something he couldn't repeat in Brazil . Not so fresh: Adverts which were popular before the World Cup may now be attracting negative attention . Steve Martin, chief executive of advertising and PR agency M&C Saatchi Sport & Entertainment, said: ‘What is quite startling is those brands still running ads and not reacting to what’s happened on the pitch. 'That can be detrimental to the brand. It’s a bit like people still driving around with England flags on their car as if they’re still in the tournament. ‘You want people having positive conversations about your brand, not people saying, “Why is that ad still running?” ‘It’s hard to put a value on how much England going out has cost them. The advertisers would have paid for the space and creating the advert. That could potentially be devalued. ‘England going out so early will cut in half potential advertising time.

The humiliated England squad leave Brazil tonight after their woeful World Cup with no bonus payments for their abject failure.

Vauxhall — who have featured captain Steven  Gerrard, Wayne Rooney and Joe Hart — pay £5million per year and Mars — with Gerrard, Danny Welbeck and Daniel Sturridge — £4m per year to be official sponsors. Neither is extending World Cup advertising beyond the group stage. Vauxhall’s even ended after England’s defeat to Uruguay on Thursday when they chose not to continue.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Humans have been decorating graves with flowers for almost 14,000 years, say archeologists. The first evidence the tradition of floral tributes has been dug up in Israel where sage, mint and other plants were used in ceremonial burials. In modern times the tradition is used as a sign of respect or remembrance, but it is believed to have started thousands of years ago to disguise the stench of the rotting corpse. It was also hoped the scent of the plants would stop animals being attracted to the grave to dig up the body. The earliest evidence of humans burying their dead with flowers, 13,700 years ago, was discovered in the same location at Mount Carmel last summer. Researchers found sage, mint (pictured) and other plants buried with the skeletons. The latest findings suggest this ritual may have been more complex than first thought . The ancient Romans often laid out the ground of the tomb as a garden so the spirit could enjoy itself as it wandered. The latest discovery was unearthed at the bottom of 13,700 to 11,700 year-old graves at a scenic prehistoric burial spot known as Raqefet Cave overlooking the Mediterranean coast. Professor Dani Nadel and his team used radiocarbon dating on the lining of tombs containing 29 skeletons, of children and adults, with four containing large plant impressions identified as the stems of sage, mint and figwort. Professor Nadel, an archaelogist at Haifa University in Israel, said: 'Flowering plants possess mechanisms that stimulate positive emotional and social responses in humans. 'It's difficult to establish when people started to use flowers in public and ceremonial events because of the scarcity of relevant evidence in the archaeological record. 'We report on uniquely preserved 13,700-11,700-year-old grave linings made of flowers suggesting such use began much earlier than previously thought.' Part of plants cells called phytoliths from grasses, leaves, reeds and sedges were identified all over the cave and on its terrace. The discovery was unearthed at the bottom of 13,700 to 11,700 year-old graves (pictured) at a scenic prehistoric burial spot known as Raqefet Cave overlooking the Mediterranean coast. Prof Nadel believes that grave preparation was a sophisticated planned process, embedded with social and spiritual meanings reflecting a complex pre-agricultural society . The burial pits also had crafted and . natural stone objects - perhaps as markers or symbols - as well as a . prevalence of flints and butchered animal bones suggesting celebratory . feasts. Prof Nadel said: 'Some of the plant species attest to spring burials with a strong emphasis on colourful and aromatic flowers. 'Cave floor chiseling to accommodate the desired grave location and depth is also evident at the site. 'Thus, . grave preparation was a sophisticated planned process, embedded with . social and spiritual meanings reflecting a complex pre-agricultural . society undergoing profound changes at the end ofthe Pleistocene.' The only earlier evidence of flower burials comes from pollen grains in a neanderthal's grave in Iraq but these could have been left by a rodent with a habit of storing seeds and flower heads. The largest number of preserved plant impressions was in the double burial of a 12 to 15 year-old adolescent and an individual over 30. The two were lying on their backs parallel to each other with their elbows juxtaposed, according to the research published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The ancient burial pit dating to nearly 14,000 years ago contained impressions from stems and flowers of aromatic plants such as sage (left) and mint (right) Prof Nadel said: 'The finds from Raqefet Cave indicate 13,700 to 11,700 years ago the Natufians lined graves with a soft mud veneer and then placed a thick cover of fresh flowering plants -thereby providing colour and aromatic fragrance. 'Experimental studies have demonstrated flowers' significant role as external sources of emotional stimuli with measurable positive impacts on human social function. 'Flowers can be used to express sympathy, pride and joy. They also are used to express religious feelings; in some religions flowers are considered the direct route for spiritual communication. 'These relationships may benefit fitness in both humans and flowers and have been linked to the domestication of certain species of flowering plants more than 5,000 years ago.' The use of flowers much earlier in social events such as funerals could have served to enhance group identity and solidarity. Prof Nadel said: 'The development of group-specific burials and related practices likely reduced social tensions and improved group cohesion in a period of fluctuating environmental conditions, increasing population density and growing social conflicts. 'The emergence of cemeteries such as those at Raqefet Cave and Hilazon Tachtit Cave also may represent new and complex social organisations which could have included the establishment or strengthening of special interest groups, inheritance of corporate property, territorial ownerships and aspects of social organisation.'","The first evidence of floral tributes on graves has been found in graves almost 14,000 years old at a scenic prehistoric burial site in Israel .

Hodgson, who is preparing his team for the final, meaningless group game with Costa Rica on Tuesday, said: ‘I’ve realised that, at this top level in a World Cup, it is unbelievably unforgiving. ‘A moment of misfortune can throw everyone into a realm of despair that you didn’t know was possible. I’ve learned how painful it is to build up your hopes and to see a lot of good preparations be of no avail because it didn’t get us to where we wanted. Scroll down for video... Staying on: Roy Hodgson has two years to get in England in shape for Euro 2016 in France . Failure: England were eliminated from the World Cup after losing their two opening games to Italy and Uruguay . ‘This game will tell me a lot about the players. It’s been a very tough few days and it’s hard to pick yourselves up for a game that, even if you do well in, serves no purpose. ‘The 100-cap players will find that hard. We’ll learn a lot about the others. I’ve liked what I’ve seen around the hotel and in training. I’m now giving them the opportunity, not because I can, but because this is a good team and they can go and win the game. I hope they prove me right. ‘We just hope the next two, four to six years will bring some dividends. We are no longer capable of going through, but we’re trying to build the confidence and use the potential of some quite talented players who have emerged on the scene. ‘All we can do is hope that, when these players are reaching their best years at the age of 28 or 29, the work shows some dividends.’ England face Costa Rica at the scene of the 1950 World Cup defeat against the USA and Hodgson has made a raft of changes to the team that was beaten 2-1 by both Italy and Uruguay. He named it yesterday before the team started their final training session inside the stadium. Second string: Hodgson has made nine changes to his team to face Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte . Next generation: Players like Raheem Sterling represent England's future . Frank Lampard will captain the side and will move level with Sir Bobby Charlton on 106 caps when he leads England out here. Lampard spoke passionately about the future of the national team before the Italy clash last week and told the players to prove they are men when they face Costa Rica in the Mineirao Stadium this afternoon. Lampard, who will make a decision on his international future over the summer, said: ‘We have to show we are men. It’s a good test of character and it’s been a tough few days. We came here to do better than what’s turned out. ‘Wayne, Steven, and Joe have all said we’re disappointed, but as grown men we have to move on. This is about showing the pride of wearing an England shirt, whether it’s a friendly or a game like this. ‘It would be easy to roll over and say it hasn’t been our tournament, and go home with three defeats. If we can take anything from this tournament it’s been the progression behind the scenes and, hopefully, a win.’ Final farewell? Frank Lampard will captain England to move level with Bobby Charlton on 106 caps . Man up! Frank Lampard has sent a rally call to England's players to not leave the tournament without a win . Lampard insisted that the management and coaching staff did everything within their power to make sure the team was successful in Brazil. He added: ‘There’s great ability, the most successful league in the world. The young players who have come into this squad were the ones we were  crying out for in the aftermath of the South Africa World Cup. ‘We have to make the most out of our attributes, all the English attributes, and if we can bring it to the table then it might be the magic dust. We have to try to learn. Talent will win you competitions. We’ve prepared very well for this tournament — they’ve not missed a trick, so there are no excuses for us players. ‘But it’s about performing on the pitch. We can hope that talent blossoms and there’s more beneath.’ Lampard also responded to Harry Redknapp’s claim that a number of Tottenham players had begged him to find an excuse to withdraw them from international duty during his spell at White Hart Lane. Next big thing: Ross Barkley will be handed a start for England's final World Cup game . Got the nod: Jack Wilshere and Luke Shaw (L) will also be given an opportunity to show what they can do . The former Chelsea midfielder said: ‘I don’t know of any present players, but if there are individuals like that then I’m sure their England careers are nothing to write home about. It should be the pinnacle. If you want to be at home or on holiday with your mates then it wouldn’t be the right attitude.’ Hodgson has changed his entire defence for tonight’s game, giving a competitive debut to Luke Shaw, and has also brought in Ross Barkley and Jack Wilshere to start alongside  Lampard in midfield. Although Liverpool forward Rickie Lambert is completely fit, he has been overlooked in favour of a third successive start for Daniel Sturridge. Three is the magic number: Daniel Sturridge will be one of only two players to start every game . Surprise package: Bryan Ruiz's Costa Rica have gone from underdogs to possible group winners . Hodgson added: ‘We have a different team and I want everyone to go home having taken part and played in this game. We are conscious of the fact that the fans are devastated. We came into the hotel and received a lot of sympathy. ‘We want to take some encouragement from that and recognise that this is a top-class international on the biggest stage. ‘Costa Rica have taken he football world by surprise and this is a chance to show that we can compete, a chance to show we have a lot of pride in our performance. ‘This is a great opportunity for the team to go out there on this fantastic stage and show that they have a lot of potential and are already good enough to wear the England shirt. ‘And I believe they will not let us down.’","Roy Hodgson says it could take six years for England players to blossom .

"By . Neil Ashton . Follow @@neilashton_ . At the end of last year, following the World Cup draw,  FA chairman Greg Dyke attempted to clarify his infamous cut-throat gesture. ‘If you can get out of the group, you’re four games from winning it,’ he said. ‘And let’s not kid ourselves — we have a chance.’ In the end, after a depressing defeat against Uruguay in Sao Paulo on Thursday, we realised we never had a chance at all. On Friday night we received confirmation. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Neil Ashton and Charles Sale deliver their verdict . Down and out: Phil Jagielka, Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney look dejected after defeat to Uruguay . Close to tears: Keeper Joe Hart sobs as he leaves the field against Uruguay . Agony: Steven Gerrard's mistake led to Luis Suarez's winner . Under fire: but Greg Dyke has backed Roy Hodgson despite England's dismal showing in Brazil . Best manager experienced? Fabio Capello. Not easy to get along with, but a serial winner at the highest level. Favourite England moment? 1986 World Cup when Gary Lineker thinks he has levelled against Argentina. You realise then what it’d mean to win it. Best player in your lifetime? Ashley Cole. The one full-back to get the better of Cristiano Ronaldo for club and country. The sooner the FA and everybody associated with England realise that every country in the world loves putting one over on us the better. When you bounce into South America with your bling and boot deals, your oxygen tents and 80 staff (including the players), you will attract some attention. Thursday evening was another brutal mugging. When Luis Suarez pulls on the colours of Los Charruas and belts out Orientales, la Patria o la Tumba, he is singing it for the 3.3million lining the streets of Montevideo. Suarez, who scored twice, would rather die for his country than lose to England. Ask him and he will tell you. There are scores of other players at this World Cup — playing for Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico or Colombia — who feel the same. National pride: Luis Suarez would die for his country rather than lose to England . Name one England player of whom you could say the same. Go on, name one. When Hodgson claimed Suarez would have to do it at a World Cup to be bracketed in the world-class category last weekend, he simply added to his motivation. Suarez, Van Persie, Muller, Robben, Sanchez, Neymar and Messi are elite players. All of them have  delivered here. These boys grow in the tunnel when they slip on the national team’s jersey. Many of Uruguay’s players are street kids, antagonised by the money England’s players earn. At 19, Raheem Sterling was the lowest-paid England player in Thursday’s starting XI. He earns £2.5m a year before endorsements. Huge wage: Raheem Sterling is the lowest paid player in the England squad at £2.5m per year . Rickie Lambert, who came on as a substitute, was raking in £55,000 a week at Southampton. He is likely to have received a pay rise at Liverpool. Good luck, because we would all do the same given half a chance, but big dosh is a big issue in international football. After Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo blew for the final whistle in Sao Paulo, England’s players couldn’t swap shirts quick enough with the opposition. Yes, it’s an accepted ritual, but at least have the decency to let the scale of what has happened sink in before hunting for souvenirs. We are weary of golden caps in big, glass presentation boxes and arguing about whether Ashley Cole should have been at this tournament (he should have, by the way). When you crow as much as the FA does about the best-laid plans — a week’s warm-weather training in Portugal, a flag-waving send-off at Wembley and a week in Miami —you’re asking for trouble. Seven days into England’s World Cup, they are out. Early exit: Danny Welbeck, Rooney and Daniel Sturridge trudge off . England’s coaching staff can put out all the white cones they like for the warm-up and it is just a tick in the box. It is no substitute for steel and strength. In Manaus, England’s players were put through a complicated pre-match procedure involving all manner of exercises. In the other half of the pitch, the Italy players were casually firing shots into  Salvatore Sirigu. It was their way of shedding tension after weeks of preparation and it worked. If we are told one more time about the ‘positives’ of losing our opening two group games, we may as well accept we are done and dusted at the highest level. Gary Neville, who has the best interests of the country at heart, claimed the Italy game was the best England performance in years. Can't bear it: Jack Wilshere watches helplessly from the sidelines as England's fate was all but sealed . If playing fast and loose is the way forward, we will need to start scoring four goals a game with a defence as poorly organised as this. We have been told many times that this tournament was designed with the development of young players in mind. Can you imagine the Chile, Argentina or Brazil coach trying that on? They would be  marmalised and replaced. When the players and FA start trotting out the line that there is no expectation on this squad, it is an excuse for failure. England’s players didn’t know what they were fighting for. Was it to get out of the group? To win the damn thing? Heroic failure? Gutted: England fans who paid thousands to see the three Lions were badly let down . The FA are so paranoid that they wouldn’t even confirm a minor injury to Danny Welbeck. Apparently, confirmation could damage the team’s chances. Get real. When Gianluigi Buffon, a World Cup winner and genuine great, turned his ankle in training, Cesare Prandelli released a short statement. Little things, for sure, but one of many little things that paint a picture of disarray. After more than a decade covering the England team, this once-in-a-lifetime World Cup experience is over already. It’s sickening.","Once-in-a-lifetime party in Brazil can't inspire Three Lions .

When Arsenal and Manchester City step out at Wembley to launch the new season on Sunday it will be 40 years since champions Leeds and FA Cup winners Liverpool contested the same fixture, then known as the Charity Shield. It was the first time the match was contested at Wembley, the first time it had been televised live in full, the first time it would go to penalties and the first time in years that champions faced FA Cup winners. Sweet charity: Kevin Keegan (right) takes a swing at Billy Bremner . It was also Bill Shankly’s last match as Liverpool manager before handing over to Bob Paisley and Brian Clough’s first serious game in his 44 days as Leeds boss. The image of Clough leading out his players was used as the cover for David Peace’s book The Damned United. Kevin Keegan and Billy Bremner were the first Brits to be dismissed at Wembley, tearing off their shirts as they trudged from the pitch. Legend: The Charity Shield was Bill Shankly’s last match as Liverpool manager . The match finished 1-1, Phil Boersma putting Liverpool ahead and Trevor Cherry replying, but Liverpool won on penalties after Leeds keeper David Harvey missed his side’s sixth spot-kick. ‘It was probably a surprise to see such a competitive spirit,’ says Harvey, ‘but the players preferred that rather than for it to be like a testimonial.’ Debut: The match between Leeds and Liverpool was the first Charity Shield match to be held at Wembley . Liverpool’s Keegan was certainly provoked. Punched by Johnny Giles he grappled with Bremner early in the second half. Both were later banned for 11 games and fined £500 apiece. ‘I loved those games against Leeds,’ says Phil Thompson, the Liverpool defender, ‘but this was the beginning of the end for that team.’ Liverpool would win 10 league titles before Leeds won it again in 1992.

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @@CraigHope01 . We are down to the . final two and this most enthralling of World Cups will climax with either . Germany or Argentina crowned champion. They are both . worthy victors, Germany having coupled fortitude with flair on their march to the . final while Argentina have proved resilient and resourceful during their . passage. But who will come . out on top? Here, Sportsmail examines the likely starting XIs and determines . who has the pick of the players on display… . VIDEO Scroll down for 'Beckham: Argentina will beat Germany 3-1, with Messi a winner' GOALKEEPER . Manuel Neuer . The Bayern Wall is a solid foundation upon which to build a team and he has been an impassable presence in Brazil. The world’s number one No1 has proved his standing as thus at the finals and – like Dino Zoff, Gianluigi Buffon and Iker Casillas – is deserving of a World Cup winner’s medal. Not getting past: Manuel Neuer has been one of the outstanding goalkeepers of the competition . Sergio Romero . To . his credit, Romero has ignored – and subsequently silenced - the . naysayers who deemed him the weak link after a season of inactivity at . Monaco. He was the star in the penalty-shootout victory over Holland and . will have to produce similar heroics if Argentina are to triumph. VERDICT: . Neuer is the best there is when it comes to the goalkeeping trade and . Romero, despite impressing, doesn’t come close to the German. Between the sticks: Romero's penalty heroics helped Argentina through to the final . RIGHT BACK . Philipp Lahm . Even from full-back he is able to influence affairs with his intelligence and ability to keep the ball and is rarely shown up on a defensive front either. Switching up: Philipp Lahm was moved from midfield back to full-back by manager Joachim Low . Pablo Zabaleta . Combative . and energetic, Zabaleta is very much the modern full-back with a . healthy dose of old-school cynicism thrown in. He is dependable and a . leader. VERDICT: Perhaps the toughest call on the park but Zabaleta shades it on his energy and aggression. Trusted: Man City defender Zabaleta has had a fantastic tournament at right-back for Argentina . CENTRE BACK . Mats Hummels . He’s on the shortlist for FIFA’s Golden Ball prize and that serves to highlight his assured and classy presence at the heart of the German backline. Scored the winner in the quarter-final defeat of France. Handy: Hummels scored the only goal against France in the quarters and was in fine form against Brazil . Ezequiel Garay . The . Benfica stopper marries grit and grizzle to his ability to play and few . forwards at these finals have enjoyed coming up against him. VERDICT: . Another one which could go either way but Hummels is one cool customer . and boasts latter-stage Champions League experience with Dortmund. Other end: Ezequiel Garay scores a penalty for Argentina in the semi-final win over Holland . CENTRE-BACK . Jerome Boateng . He has grown into the tournament and, given his ease in possession, fits well into the German model. Versatile: Boateng fends off a challenge from Olivier Giroud in the quarter-final victory . Martin Demichelis . Argentina . have looked better for his presence and, although a gaffe is never too . far away, the veteran has been solid and reliable. VERDICT: . Manchester City past and present, but its former defender Boateng who . gets the nod given his athleticism and ability to recover a situation. For once Demichelis makes a mistake it is invariably punished. Sliding in: City defender Demichelis did a good job marshaling Arjen Robben on Wednesday evening . LEFT BACK . Benedikt Howedes . He is seldom exposed despite being more accustomed to a central role and is used to being charged with shackling the likes of Messi and Higuain. Dependable: Benedikt Howedes has been solid throughout Germany's World Cup campaign . Marcos Rojo . There were doubts about the Sporting defender given his preference for a more central posting but he has excelled at left-back. VERDICT: . Both players would prefer to be playing at centre-back but have adapted . admirably to their duty in Brazil but it is the experience and know-how . of Howedes which wins him the nod. Passion: Argentina's Marcos Rojo celebrates after the shootout win over the Dutch . DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDER . Bastian Schweinsteiger . He keeps it simple but keeps the ball with it and is the heartbeat of this side. He has the personality for the biggest stage and will be desperate to add a World Cup to his enviable haul of trophies. Experience: Schweinsteiger is playing in his sixth major tournament with Germany . Javier Mascherano . Note . to Barcelona: play him in midfield and Mascherano is the best in the . business. He breaks play, builds play and whips others into shape with . the standard he sets. His tackle to deny Arjen Robben at the death in . the semi-final captured everything about his contribution; courageous, . athletic and game-changing. VERDICT: . The Argentina man is an all-action hero whose side could not function . without his influence, and for that he is deserving of his place ahead . of Schweinsteiger. [caption . DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDER . Sami Khedira . He turned in one of the performances of the finals against Brazil, combining graft and craft and chipping in with a goal. He gallops around the park but brings a classy, calming influence to the team at the same time. Class act: Khedira controlled the game in Belo Horizonte as Germany beat Brazil 7-1 . Lucas Biglia . The . Lazio man is understated but don’t underestimate his ability and he . compliments well the snarl of Mascherano in the middle of the pitch. VERDICT: . Khedira is a class act and brings the recent – and invaluable - . experience of his Champions League victory with Real Madrid to the . party. Chance: Lazio midfielder Biglia has only started two of Argentina's six World Cup games this tournament . ATTACKING MIDFIELDER . Toni Kroos . Much has been made of the scramble for his signature and now we know why. Be it five yards or fifty, left boot or right, Kroos locates his team-mates with unerring accuracy and – as his double against Brazil proved – he can be clinical in front of goal. On his watch: Toni Kroos is one German midfielder who can control the pace of the game in Rio . Enzo Perez . He did well against Holland and is bright and energetic. He is, however, no match for the injured Angel Di Maria. VERDICT: ‘Kroos Control’ is the ultimate midfield player and will again seek to dictate affairs in the final. Pace: Enzo Perez races away from Dirk Kuyt and Wesley Sneijder during the semi-final in Sao Paulo . ATTACKING MIDFIELDER . Thomas Muller . He . can’t tackle, isn’t a great passer, doesn’t really have a turn of foot . and can’t dribble – sound familiar? Each of the above has been said of . Muller yet he has been the player of the tournament and his unyielding . hunger for goals has been rewarded on five occasions. On the chase: Muller has a chance of being named Golden Boot winner for a second straight World Cup . Ezequiel Lavezzi . The PSG forward works hard, yes, but where are the goals and assists? Much more is needed if Argentina are to upset the odds. VERDICT: Muller is a star, Lavezzi is something of a myth. Getaway: PSG star Lavezzi escapes Georginio Wijnaldum during the nervy semi-final . ATTACKING MIDFIELDER . Mesut Ozil . He has come in for criticism back in Germany and rightly so. He is the lazy link in this fantastic German side and has been a passenger during their journey to the final. Roar: Ozil has the chance to answer his critics after a quiet World Cup for Germany . Lionel Messi . Is . he saving one last explosion of magic for the final? We hope so. Outstanding in the group stage but subdued in the knockout rounds, Messi . is nonetheless the best player on the park and without him Argentina . would not stand a chance. VERDICT: Even if Ozil had impressed – which he hasn’t – Messi would still win this one hands down. Superstar: Lionel Messi finally has the chance to make himself a hero on the biggest stage of all . STRIKER . Miroslav Klose . It’s a simple science: goals win games and, to that end, Mirsolav Klose is a match-winner. His 16 are now a World Cup record and, although he does little else around the pitch, who cares? Down in history: Miroslav Klose is now the all-time leading goalscorer in World Cup history . Gonzalo Higuain . Like . Klose, Higuain is a man who trades in goals. However, it hasn’t . happened for him in Brazil and he has, in truth, been a disappointment. VERDICT: . Higuain’s profligacy has almost cost his side but Klose has proved . predatory in the big moments and is chosen ahead of the Argentine.

A week shy of his 21st birthday and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has emerged with his spirits unscathed after a season when injuries conspired to rule him out of the World Cup and Arsenal’s first trophy win in nine years. ‘Things I’ve learned?’ the Ox wondered aloud, as he reflected on the past 12 months. ‘Don’t get injured. It’s not nice.’ More opportunities are sure to follow, starting with Sunday’s FA Community Shield against Manchester City, which heralds a fresh start for the England midfielder. He's back: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is fighting for ahead of the new Premier League season . Bitter blow: Oxlade-Chamberlain (pictured) missed the World Cup with a knee injury . ‘I’ve learned to cope with disappointing times,’ he added. ‘It’s the first time I’ve had a situation like that. It’s horrible to see everyone playing and getting the rewards from winning games when you can’t do that. But if you look at it with a positive attitude, you do come out of the other side really well. ‘You work on things you don’t know about until you’re injured. Everyone goes to the gym for the bicep bells and bench-press, but when you’re injured you work on your core, your pelvic floor, groins, glutes, stuff like yoga that makes you stronger all-round in terms of injury prevention. I’ve learned to look after my body more than I used to.’ Oxlade-Chamberlain damaged cruciate knee ligaments on the opening day of last season but returned in good form in January, only to be troubled by a groin problem at the end of the campaign. He missed the FA Cup final but was ruled fit for the World Cup, only to suffer a minor knee injury in a warm-up friendly against Ecuador in Miami. Ouch: The winger was injured during a tackle from Carlos Greuzo during a World Cup warm-up match . Roy Hodgson kept him in the squad but a setback ahead of England’s final game, against Costa Rica, dashed all hope of featuring in the tournament. ‘It was a great experience to be at a World Cup,’ he said. ‘I took a lot from being around the camp. I definitely wouldn’t have wanted to be sat at home. I was handing out water bottles and trying to get the boys through the games when they were cramping. That’s the feeling you get in a team.’ His mood is echoed at the Emirates Stadium, where Arsenal are relishing the chance to prove the FA Cup triumph will spark a new era of success. All smiles: Oxlade-Chamberlain has emerged with his spirits unscathed after a season on the sidelines . ‘We all believed it would happen soon,’ said Oxlade-Chamberlain. ‘It was a reward for the hard work and togetherness we’ve had to show. It does start a winning momentum. 'Once you know you can win a competition like that, it gives you confidence. It’s really exciting to see someone like Alexis Sanchez come in and our World Cup winners will come back and give us another lift. These are exciting times. ‘It makes you want to strive for more.

Players and managers in the Barclays Premier League will be told the doctor’s decision must be final as part of a new directive designed to protect players from head injuries. New rules are being introduced this season after high-profile concussions involving Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris and Everton striker Romelu Lukaku and a series of incidents at the World Cup. Clear guidelines will be brought in for the Premier League campaign starting on Saturday week which will state that the doctor’s decision is paramount when it comes to deciding whether or not a player can continue. New rule: The Premier League will introduce a tunnel doctor to oversee any head collisions . Right decision? Hugo Lloris clashed with Romelu Lukaku last season but finished the match against Everton . Dangerous: The Spurs medical staff came under criticism for allowing Lloris to continue . Under new guidelines to deal with head injuries, even if there is no loss of consciousness then an assessment should take place on the pitch or the touchline to judge whether there is a risk of concussion. It follows a number of incidents last season, including at the World Cup, where players continued despite appearing to have been concussed. The new guidelines state: 'If there has been a confirmed or suspected period of loss of consciousness, the player must be removed from the field of play, and not be allowed to return. Speaking out: The Mail On Sunday have campaigned for change to the rules across sports . The Mail on Sunday has led the way in urging the governing bodies of all sports, but especially football and rugby, to properly concussion. Since launching the campaign last September support has grown with everyone from politicians to stars across the pond agreeing the issue needs to be addressed. Our efforts have seen calls for a cross-party parliamentary inquiry in to the issue. In November the Rugby Football Union announced that they will consider mandatory concussion training for all players and will review the controversial Pitch-side Concussion Assessment protocol. And now football, too, has taken steps to properly protect players from what is a dangerous occurrence in sport. One that, if not addressed properly, can lead to serious long-term problems. For more information on our campaign visit: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/concussion/index.html . 'If there is any doubt as to the course of events, elucidation may be sought from officials or other players. In the event that there is video replay available pitch-side or in the players' tunnel, this could be used to clarify the course of events. 'Where no loss of consciousness is apparent an on-field or touchline assessment will take place.' There must also be an additional 'tunnel doctor' present at all Premier League games, who can study video replays and help the club doctors assess potential concussion injuries with information which may have been missed by the medical team on the touchline. A concussion recognition tool-kit will be supplied warning of the symptoms to look for and how to respond. This will be supplied to all clubs and carried by all medical practitioners, and will advise that players must come off, even if concussion is only 'suspected'. Players will also be submitted to baseline cognitive assessment in pre-season to help doctors manage their recovery after a head injury. The Premier League will also remind all clubs to comply with the FIFA-approved guidelines issued by the Concussion in Sports Group (CISG) in Zurich in 2012, stating that athletes in all sports should not return to action for a minimum of six to seven days. It is in conjunction with a poster campaign to raise awareness of concussion in football, which will be promoted through the Football League and into the grassroots of the game by the Football Association. Injury: Germany's Christoph Kramer (centre) gets hit in the face by Ezequiel Garay during the World Cup final . Off: The German youngster played on after the collision but was eventually substituted . England players Steven Gerrard, Rickie Lambert, Phil Jones and Luke Shaw appear in a video to publicise the key messages, such as 'don’t be a hero', 'listen to the medics' and 'get off the pitch'. Leading brain injury charity Headway has welcomed the changes. 'The measures are a significant step forward in the protection of footballers at all levels and therefore are warmly welcomed,' said chief executive Peter McCabe. 'The more we know about head and brain injury, the better we understand the risks of continuing to play competitive sport following a concussion. The guidelines at all levels, from FIFA to the FA and Premier League, have to date been insufficient and ineffective, as demonstrated by numerous high-profile examples. 'It is vital that decisions regarding a player’s suitability to return to the field of play are made by independent doctors, with measures put in place to protect them against pressure from club staff or the players themselves.' These are the changes brought in to help football’s medics after the findings from a working group established during last season after the Lloris and Lukaku incidents, and chaired by England doctor Ian Beasley. Spurs keeper Lloris was knocked unconscious in a clash with Lukaku in November but ignored medical advice and insisted on returning to the pitch to continue. Groggy: Romelu Lukaku was knocked out in the action of scoring for Everton against West Ham last season . Keep going: The Belgian forward briefly received treatment before playing on in the Premier League clash . Manager Andre Villas-Boas backed his player rather than his doctor - which he will not be able to do under the new rules – but subsequent tests ruled Lloris out of the next two Tottenham games. The goalkeeper did not play again for 12 days. 'There are worldwide guidelines but people in football are unaware,' said Arsenal doctor Gary O’Driscoll, the chair of the Premier League doctors’ group. 'It is a relatively uncommon injury in football and the science of concussion is very poorly understood. 'We must stop this feeling that it’s a brave or heroic decision to stay on and that’s it’s an injury you can run off. The doctor’s decision must be final.' Tottenham doctor Shabaaz Mughal was part of the working group, as were experts like Simon Kemp, head of sports medicine at the RFU, Michael Turner, horseracing’s chief medical officer, and neurosurgeon Peter Hamlyn. Collision: Georginio Wijnaldum kicks the ball as Javier Mascherano tries a header during the World Cup . Down: The Argentina star stumbled to the ground after the sickening collision . Earlier in the season, Lukaku had been knocked out while scoring for Everton at West Ham and confessed he could not remember anything about the goal. Still, he was allowed to play on, as was Stoke’s Robert Huth in a game against Manchester City. The exposure of these incidents convinced those in football that something had to be done and their instinct seemed to be confirmed when Uruguay’s Alvaro Perreira and Argentina’s Javier Mascherano both continued to play after being knocked briefly unconscious during World Cup games. Some changes were made to Premier League protocol after Petr Cech fractured his skull playing for Chelsea against Reading in 2006, making it compulsory to have a doctor on the bench and making sure an ambulance was on stand-by at the ground for players. These changes were credited with helping to keep Fabrice Muamba alive after his heart attack playing for Bolton at Tottenham in 2012. Worrying scenes: Uruguay players gather around Alvaro Pereira after he is knocked out . Saying no: Pereira refuses to leave the field after coming round following his collision .","Premier League players and managers will be told the doctor's decision is final if a head injury occurs .

Harry Redknapp’s remedy for England’s World Cup hangover is to stop trying to mimic their more successful European rivals and focus on producing football branded with their own national identity. After signing former England captain Rio Ferdinand, the Queens Park Rangers manager claimed there are plenty of quality players and wants to see Roy Hodgson forge them into a team based on attacking flair with the confidence to play out of defence.

Harry Redknapp will not order Rio Ferdinand to end his media commitments but is convinced the centre-half will focus squarely on Queens Park Rangers for the next 12 months. Redknapp believes 35-year-old Ferdinand, who won six Barclays Premier League titles, is motivated by a desire to prove he can still perform at the top after losing his place at Manchester United. 'What we’re paying him here isn’t going to change his life,' said the QPR boss. 'He can walk away, do anything he wants. He’s on the A-Team at the BBC, up there with Alan Hansen and Alan Shearer at the World Cup final, the day they had to go bosh and pick the top three pundits.

Warm welcome: The former West ham defender greets young fans before signing his contract . 'He’s got a great future if he wants in television. I wouldn’t want to him on TV at 5.30 on a Saturday night, after coming off 10 minutes from the end. 'There was a player a few years ago who kept turning up on the radio on “606” and I thought: ""How on earth has he got there?""' Ferdinand rejected moves to Tottenham and West Ham and mind-bogglingly lucrative offers to play abroad. He started life at QPR with a double training session on Friday. He impressed as a World Cup pundit at the BBC and will continue to work as an ambassador for BT Sport but Redknapp insisted: 'Rio is going to concentrate on his football. 'He’s a focused boy. He’s genuine. He’s got other business interests but he won’t come here unless he’s sure. Why mug yourself off when you’ve been a top player? Why put yourself under that pressure for a few quid? 'He’s not stupid. He’s doing it because he believes he can still play at the top level. He wants to come here and play football. Otherwise he would have walked away to be an ambassador in Indonesia or earn a fortune in Qatar. He said: ""No, I want to play football."" He’s here to play.' Redknapp has earned a reputation in his career for squeezing a few more years from high-calibre footballers, including Paul Merson, Teddy Sheringham and Sol Campbell. 'You will always get doubters and people who say he’s finished,' said the QPR boss. 'I back my own judgement and opinion. Everybody said Sol was finished when I took him and he was as good as any centre-half in the Premier League. 'Rio didn’t need convincing. He wanted to come to QPR. He spoke to two top London clubs, but he wanted to come here and to play. He could have gone elsewhere and maybe not played at times.' New chapter: Ferdinand posted an image on his Twitter account after signing . Farewell: Ferdinand left Manchester United after 12 years of success at Old Trafford . BORN: London, Nov 7 1978 (age 35) 1996-2000: West Ham (127 apps, 2 gls) 1996-1997: Bournemouth (loan) (10, 0) 2000-2002: Leeds United (54, 2) 2002-2014: Manchester United (312, 7) 2014-NOW: QPR . There was also a glowing reference from Ryan Giggs, who confirmed Ferdinand was in good physical shape, despite only started 21 games for Manchester United last season, and theories that he was not able to play twice in a week. Redknapp said: 'I spoke to Ryan, not that I had doubts, just to ask how much training Rio did and Ryan said if he had still had been his manager this year then he would have been his No.1 centre-half. When he took over last year the first thing he did was put Rio back in the team. 'He was fit all year, but David (Moyes) came in and wanted to change the team around. He didn’t pick him. We got his records from Man United and he was the fourth or fifth highest player, in terms of being available for training and playing.' Ferdinand will not have to wait long to go back to Old Trafford. QPR are due there on September 14. Redknapp was manager at West Ham when he first saw Ferdinand and pipped Millwall to sign the schoolboy. Old: Ferdinand started his senior career at West Ham in 1996 before going to Leeds United in 2000 . 'He came and played in our youth team . and from Day One I knew,' said the QPR boss. 'When he was 16, I said he . would be the best defender in Europe one day and he was. I wasn’t a bad . judge really. 'I was away . with the first-team at Newcastle one day when the youth team had Chelsea . and my Dad went to watch and said he’d seen the best kid he’d seen in . years. 'I went through about . seven of our kids and he kept saying no. Then he said Ferdinand. I said . ""nah, he couldn’t have played Dad, he is still a schoolboy."" It was a . Southern Junior Floodlight Cup final. 'I . was at the first game, when we lost - we got beat something like 4-2 - . and then we won the second leg at Stamford Bridge and we won the cup on . aggregate. 'When . I spoke to our youth team manager Tony Carr and asked if Rio Ferdinand . had played he said he’d never seen anything like it. He played in . midfield. Fantastic.' Redknapp . expects Ferdinand to bring a positive influence to Loftus Road on and . off the pitch, and the first of those may be to convince Steven Caulker . to sign.

Remy wants to leave for Champions League football, Adel Taarabt is keen . to return to AC Milan where he spent last season on loan, and the QPR . boss would like to recruit more players but he is wary not to repeat the . same mistakes the club made when they were last promoted to the top . flight and loaded the squad with players of questionable quality on . bloated contracts.

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . Lucas Piazon is ready to hit the road again. Not only on Chelsea’s pre-season training camp in Austria but also for another season away from London as he continues his quest to impress Jose Mourinho. After six months with Malaga in Spain and a prolific season at Vitesse Arnhem in Holland, Piazon is preparing for another loan move, possibly to Germany because Mourinho is keen to see him tested in a tougher competition, like the Bundesliga. The Chelsea boss will watch with interest. As will an audience in Brazil. Piazon possesses the poise and elegance missing from Luiz Felipe Scolari’s team at the World Cup and many hope this is the season when he makes a stride towards realising his huge potential. Out to impress: Chelsea's Lucas Piazon, 20, will go out on loan again this season, likely to the Bundesliga . Proving himself: Piazon (left) has played three times for Chelsea, with time spent time in Spain and Holland . Several talented young footballers will exit Stamford Bridge on loan before the end of August to a temporary new home in a new environment, all of them after the same result. 'I will try to keep improving myself and have a good season,' said Piazon, still only 20 and under contract until 2017. 'It is time for me to grow up and do something that will keep me in the plans for Chelsea. 'It’s where I want to play. It’s a club I really like and where the people treat me well from the day I first arrived. If not, I must show another club what I can do but I came from Brazil when I was 17 to play for Chelsea and that is still the target for my career. 'I know it is difficult, they have the best players in the world. That’s why we are all going on loan, to improve ourselves and try to be back one day. The young players always talk about it. We say: ""It’s time to go on loan again, meet new people and find a new coach"". Sometimes it’s hard but it’s necessary if you want to reach where you really want to be. Ups and downs: Piazon had a stellar start to the season with Vitesse scoring 11 in 16 games, but fell away . Proving himself: Although he's been sent away from England, Piazon believes he made the right move . 'You get the wrong loan and you lose one year from your career. Every single loan, every single season is important for a footballer. Or you find the right loan and you get minutes, confidence and experience; you get the rhythm of the game. It is good to be playing every week. When you ‘re not playing you’re not happy.' Piazon had a sweet and sour time at Vitesse, the Dutch club with a special relationship with Chelsea. He started in sublime touch, scoring 11 in his first 16 games as Vitesse raced away to the top of the league. They were daring to dream in Arnhem of their first ever title and the Champions League when the season collapsed. Weight of a nation: Piazon could be part of the new breed of Brazilians to turn the national team's fortunes around . They won only four of 19 after the mid-winter break and finished in sixth, missing out on Europe, and Piazon did not score another goal. He was dropped in the New Year and unhappy that he seemed to be singled out as a scapegoat for the team’s loss of impetus by manager Peter Bosz. 'Everybody was going crazy, saying: What’s happening?' said Piazon. 'The coach was like this, too. We had difficult games. Nobody was playing well. And he changed just one player, as if I was the only problem. I don’t think I should have been the one to blame but that was his choice. 'In the end, I think everyone could see I wasn’t the problem. He chose to take me out and after this we won only three games. We finished sixth and lost at home in the play-offs. If he wanted change, he had to change more people than just myself. 'I decided I had to wait for the season to finish and then find a new beginning. But now when I look back, I’m pleased with my time at Vitesse. It’s a nice club. I arrived and started a game three days later, I scored some goals and played some minutes. We were top after 20 games.' After this experience, there was no question of him returning, but his goals in Holland made an impact in Brazil and Piazon received his first international call-up since the U17 World Cup in Mexico in 2011, the same year he left Sao Paulo for Chelsea. He was called into the U20 squad for the Toulon tournament, made three appearances, scored once and flew home with a winners’ medal to enjoy the World Cup. Finding success: Lucas Piazon kneels with Marquinhos after Brazil won the Toulon Tournament final in June . 'After almost three years outside the Brazilian squad, it was good to play with a few of the guys I knew from before,' said Piazon, who had played youth football at Sao Paulo with Rodrigo Caio, voted the best player at Toulon, and midfield playmaker Ademilson. Both have broken into Sao Paulo’s senior squad but Piazon has no regrets about his decision to move to Europe at 17. Were he still at his former club, he would be competing for a place in the attacking unit with the formidable trio of Kaka, Luis Fabiano and Alexandre Pato. Here, he may be about to leave on loan again but there are signs of progress and encouragement which Chelsea hope will mature and flourish this season. 'The move to Europe has been good for me,' Piazon said. 'I’m OK with my career. I played in Spain. I played in Holland and three games at Chelsea. I didn’t make a mistake. It was the right choice. I was 17 in Sao Paulo and I was training with the U17s, so I think it was the best thing for me at that moment. I hope I’m right.'","Piazon has spent loan stints with Malaga and Vitesse since joining Chelsea .

Mike Ingham, the voice of football for a generation of radio listeners, will step down after the World Cup final, marking the end of an era for BBC sport. Ingham has been chief football correspondent for more than 20 years, bringing his unique blend of effortless eloquence and good sense to the Beeb’s football coverage. In a time when others shout, scream and deliberately  provoke in the quest for attention, his delivery has remained steadfastly calm, clear-headed and intelligent, adding to his natural authority and earning him the respect of managers and players. Stepping down: Mike Ingham (right), the voice of BBC radio commentaries for over 30 years, is set to hang up his microphone after this Sunday's World Cup final between Germany and Argentina at the Maracana . Honour: Ingham was made an MBE by the Queen at Buckingham Palace back in November 2010 . His final live game will not be a storybook ending featuring England in the Maracana, but Argentina and Germany provide a fitting end with a repeat of the final from his first World Cup in 1986. ‘The world has gone full circle,’ said Ingham. ‘I’ve no idea how many games I’ve commentated on but over 30 years it’s probably around 2,000. I don’t know how I’ll cope with the last one. ‘You get in a bubble when you’re working. It will probably hit me the day after, or when the Champions League music plays next season. Certainly when England play Switzerland. That’s when I will realise my life has changed.’ It all started on BBC Radio Derby, where Ingham worked for six years from 1973, often working on the coverage of Derby County, the team he supported as a boy. A famous 3-0 win against Benfica at the Baseball Ground in the European Cup is one of his fondest memories of days on the terraces and, years later, he would be light-heartedly unveiled as a Rams fan, live on air during a Derby game, by co-commentator Bruce Rioch. Early days: Ingham working for BBC Radio Derby interviewing Tommy Docherty and Charlie George . Commentary duo: 5 Live men Alan Green and Ingham pose for publicity pictures ahead of the 2006 World Cup in Germany . Ingham moved to Broadcasting House in London, presenting key programmes such as Sport on Two and took over from Bryon Butler as football correspondent in 1991, with the game on the threshold of a revolution. ‘The onset of the Premier League and the volume of games broadcast live on radio has been the biggest change,’ said Ingham, who was in the commentary box when Brian Deane scored the first Premier League goal. He maintained his ability to find the crucial elements of any story amid the chaos and crystallise it for the listener, as he did brilliantly on the night England’s players threatened to strike over Rio Ferdinand’s ban for a missed drugs test. Describing the action: Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown (centre) with Ingham (right) and Green (left) at a match between Aston Villa and Tottenham last season . Ingham has always been a huge music fan, often seen searching for second-hand record shops while on trips abroad. And he enjoys fine wine, as Terry Butcher, his co-commentator on many occasions, can testify. Retirement will allow him more time to devote to these hobbies and to his family, wife Lorna and children George, 13 tomorrow, and Marshall, 20. ‘They have been my rocks,’ he said. Ingham will still be an occasional voice on Radio 5 Live, working on some of the channel’s documentaries. John Murray will take over as BBC football correspondent.

No Neymar means no trophy and no trophy means no escaping the nightmare which has haunted Brazil for 64 years — ever since the last time they failed to win the World Cup on home soil. That appeared to be the consensus as celebrations that followed a 2-1 win against Colombia in a pulsating quarter-final were tinged with  sadness. Neymar’s injury had swiftly been confirmed as a broken vertebra, an X-ray was broadcast on television to prove the point and president Dilma Rousseff took to social media to offer her best wishes for a speedy recovery. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch videos of Neymar after his World Cup ending injury . Emotional: David Luiz hugs Neymar as he waits to board an ambulance after Friday's win over Colombia . Cynical: With the ball nowhere near Juan Zuniga smashes his knee into the lower part of Neymar's back . Agony: Neymar clutches his back after going down injured during Brazil's win over Colombia on Friday . Carried away: Neymar was stretchered off the pitch and taken to hospital after Brazil's quarter-final win . ‘Forca Neymar,’ she tweeted, as did others such as model Gisele Bundchen, Miami Heat basketball star LeBron James and German footballers including Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski, who must have been secretly delighted to learn Brazil’s best player cannot face them in Tuesday’s semi-final. Hundreds of bright yellow replica No 10 shirts on market stalls and hawked by street sellers seemed to sag in disappointment, crested hairstyles drooped around Brazil and bookmakers, for the first time, decided the hosts could no longer be considered favourites to win. Neymar will not play again in this tournament. The initial diagnosis predicted an absence of about six weeks from football and, while parallels can be drawn with Pele — the original  No 10 who also hailed from the  Santos club and was fouled out of a World Cup, ending Brazilian hopes in 1966 — others tried to lift the gloom. Leading the campaign was David Luiz, climbing the popularity polls with a statesmanlike air. Get well soon: Thiago Silva hugs Neymar as the Brazil team wish their star man well after his injury . Precaution: Neymar is wheeled into hospital and appears to be on a drip as doctors attend to the injured star . Not only is he scoring precious goals, like the brilliant free-kick against Colombia, but the centre-half has a canny knack for connecting with the masses. ‘To play in a semi-final of the World Cup is a dream,’ said Luiz. ‘When I was young, I dreamed of days like this but I am sad because Neymar is out of the competition. 'He is like my brother. He is a great guy, a great person and a great player who brings the good things to football: happiness and magic. ‘Brazil will suffer a lot from this loss but Neymar will help us with his happiness. We have made a pact to support him. He will grow taller from this moment. It would be great if we could win it and celebrate with him.’ Moving: Neymar was flown to Sao Paulo by helicopter to begin his recovery . Devastated: Neymar is transported from an ambulance to a military helicopter to be airlifted home . Thanks: Neymar managed a wave as he left for Sao Paulo . Inside the squad, Neymar is so much more than an icon of youth culture. You can see that the warmth and affection colleagues reserve for him is genuine when you watch them training, where he laughs if one of his tricks fails and he is teased like anyone else. True, he is their most gifted creative force, capable of lifting Brazil out of the ordinary, but he also grafts and offers more humility than you might expect for a diamond-studded 22-year-old whose image appears at every turn and who is adored by millions. ‘Neymar is a boy who fights a lot,’ said Luiz. ‘He dreamed about playing in a World Cup and now he is out because of a foul the defender probably should have avoided.’ Colombia’s Juan Zuniga is Brazil’s new public enemy, the man who rammed his knee into the base of Neymar’s spine as they contested the ball near the end of the quarter-final. Support: Brazilian model Gisele Budnchen said she was praying for a fast recovery for her compatriot . Team spirit: Leo Messi also took to social media to wish his Barcelona teammate a speedy recovery . Manager Luiz Felipe Scolari claimed his star man had been ‘hunted’ by opponents after his terrific start to the tournament. Neymar suffered a knee injury against Chile when he was cut down in full flight. The Brazil manager, however, swerved the fact that his own side had employed strong-arm tactics on Friday in a bid to silence James Rodriguez, of Colombia. Luiz added: ‘I never crucify players. You do things when you are emotional and don’t think. 'I will just say if he did it with bad intentions because he wanted to  injure him, then I think he will feel sad. If he just tried to stop the game that’s natural, that’s football.’ Brazil captain Thiago Silva offered support for Zuniga. ‘I know him from Serie A and he does not have any nastiness in him,’ said PSG defender Silva, who was formerly at AC Milan. ‘What he did was rash but I know it can be difficult to get the ball from Neymar.’ The challenge is to prove there is life after Neymar for a team that have come to rely rather too heavily on his invention and goal threat. Without him, they will fret about how much they can create from open play. National icon: The Barcelona forward is by far the most popular player in Luiz Felipe Scolari's squad . Against Chile and Colombia, the goals came from centre-halves Luiz, who scored twice, and Silva, all from set-pieces. Who wins most of these free-kicks and corners? Neymar, by dribbling at defenders. In his absence, there will be a greater onus on others. Oscar is expected to return to a central role, which he will relish, and his Chelsea team-mate Willian is among the candidates to come in against Germany in Belo Horizonte. Almost as bad for Scolari is the loss of Silva. The captain is suspended after picking up a yellow card for interfering with a kick by Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina. Broken: The x-ray showing Neymar's injured back, highlighting the broken bone . Silva was magnificent in the  quarter-final on Friday. He is the team’s strongest and most reliable defender, providing the stability which allows Luiz to step forward and contribute on the counter-attack. The loss will be eased by the return of defensive midfielder Luiz Gustavo after a one-match ban but will still be keenly felt. ‘This is the moment to show the strength of the squad,’ said Silva. ‘This moment could mark the start of a revolution for us. 'We have proposed to win the World Cup for Neymar. This could unite us. It could give us more determination to win.’","Neymar out of the tournament after injury late in the quarter-final .

His performances in Brazil — culminating in a save to thwart Greece’s Theofanis Gekas in a penalty shoot-out and clinch Costa Rica’s quarter-final date with Holland — make this seem like a bargain price. ‘It has taken him to centre stage,’ said Borges. ‘We knew it from the start. The secret was out. He deserves the attention. He’s a great person and he has given us so much. With his saves, we get second chances.’ As he was drenched in praise, Navas reacted with a modest shrug. He thanked God and dedicated the win to his family, before adding: ‘It was the dream of an entire country. We are so proud. I work in a humble way to do things for my team.’ There is, of course, more to Costa Rica than an exceptional goalkeeper, whose contract expires in 2015. There is Pinto’s attention to detail, the inspiration of Wanchope and Colombian sociologist Jamie Perozzo Garcia, who provides ‘emotional advice’ as psychiatrist Steve Peters did for England, with  different results.

Pinto claimed it was important many had been . educated at university so they can better absorb his strategies. ‘They . learn faster,’ said the boss. Pinto knew he had goal-power in attack, . with Bryan Ruiz, Joel Campbell and Christian Bolanos, and devoted his . time to organising a solid defence, with three central defenders, wing . backs and tireless midfielders Borges and Yeltsin Tejeda. Time . devoted to practising penalties was rewarded in Recife with five crisp . spot-kicks. ‘It’s all about having no hesitation,’ said Borges, who . scored the first. ‘We’ve been practising so much I knew where I was . going to shoot.

He thought his friend was dead. ‘He had no pulse, he looked so pale,’ said Platini. When the teams meet in the World Cup, as they do on Friday in Rio de Janeiro, those images are rekindled, still capable of provoking horror: the lifeless figure carried from the field with his right arm dangling limp over the side of the stretcher. Platini takes Battiston’s hand and holds it as he walks beside the medics, kisses it and lays it gently across his team-mate’s chest before returning to complete the game. Thankfully, the story has a happy ending. Battiston is today the Academy director at Bordeaux and fully aware of his place in World Cup folklore: the innocent victim to Schumacher’s evil aggressor whenever these European rivals clash. Sickening: West Germany keeper Harald Schumacher collides with France's Patrick Battiston . ‘Entrenched in our memories is this charge by Schumacher who flattened the little Frenchman,’ said 57-year-old Battiston. ‘That’s how things are. People talk to me about 1982 often. But it wasn’t only about me.’ He broke two teeth, cracked three ribs and damaged a vertebra but holds no grudge, describing Schumacher as ‘someone who wanted to win at all costs’ and ‘went way over the top’. Battiston had only just come on as a substitute and recalled how he had noticed from his seat on the bench how the German goalkeeper had seemed ‘hyped up’. Thirty-two years on, there will be no cry for revenge as the teams meet again in the Maracana  Stadium. ‘I have forgiven,’ said Battiston. ‘We will never know if it was deliberate or not. Over time I have come to realise people have forever marked him with this.’ Back home in Germany after  losing in the final to Italy, Schumacher began to understand the impact his challenge had made — not only on the health of Battiston, who was recovering in hospital — but on the public. Sickening: France defender Battiston is knocked out and goes down . Concern: France defender Battiston required emergency treatment including oxygen . The Cologne goalkeeper made an apology. ‘Maybe he did feel guilty,’ said Battiston. Schumacher would later claim he had been unaware how serious the injury was. Also that French players surrounding Battiston kept him at a distance with threatening glances. Dutch referee Charles Corver had not even awarded a foul, let alone flashed a yellow card. Houllier, who is at the World Cup as part of FIFA’s technical study group, agreed there is no way the goalkeeper would have stayed on the pitch in the modern game. Had it occurred this year in  Brazil, Schumacher would have been instantly dismissed for a reckless challenge endangering an opponent and the incident would have been investigated by the same disciplinary chiefs who have banned Luis Suarez from all football for four months for biting. All hell would break loose if Manuel Neuer performed a similar assault tomorrow. Even in 1982, it was extreme and a television audience was stunned, concerned and aghast at the arrogance of the  German. A goal-kick was awarded and he seemed impatient to take it. He kept putting the ball down, flicking it up, passing it with team-mates, sticking it under his arm as if bored by the delay as the medics attended to Battiston. Later in his book, Schumacher said: ‘Feeling very awkward, I stood in goal messing around with the ball. It was cowardice. Perhaps it was the first moment in my life when I was a real coward.’Corver claimed he had missed the impact because he followed the ball. Battiston’s effort had bounced narrowly wide. Pace man: France's Paul Pogba (centre) sprints during a training session on Wednesday . VIDEO Team Profile: France . If anything, it was Schumacher’s flippant post-match remarks offering to pay for the dental work which annoyed him the most. ‘It was pretty gauche,’ said Battiston. ‘To this day I have a cracked vertebra and broken teeth.’ He recently stumbled across footage of the game on television and was intrigued by the drama that unfolded as he slipped into a coma . The match went into extra time where there was an explosion of four goals in little over quarter of an hour. A volley by Marius Tresor and a strike from the edge of the box by Alain Giresse put France 3-1 up. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, unable to start because of injury, came off the bench to pull one back and Klaus Fischer equalised. It was exactly the style of end-to-end game which has typified this World Cup in Brazil. West Germany’s Uli Stielike was the first to miss from the spot, denied by Jean-Luc Ettori, but Schumacher responded with saves from Didier Six and Maxime Bossis.

Shortly after the World Cup, a French newspaper poll rated Schumacher as the nation’s most hated German, just ahead of Hitler. He was dubbed ‘The Butcher of Seville’.

Somewhere amid what seems like a never-ending cascade of empty promises and psychobabble about ‘positive signs’ and a brighter future for English football, there was this frank assessment of the World Cup by Jack Wilshere. ‘It’s easy for me to stand here and say we’re young and we can go forward,’ said the Arsenal midfielder. ‘But if you look at a team like Germany, they’ve got young players who are delivering now. ‘Time is running out for us to say we’re young. I’ll be 23 in January and that’s a good age for a footballer. Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling are good young players. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wilshere, Sturridge, Sterling and the Ox in Miami . Back home: Jack Wilshere walks across the tarmac at Luton Airport as England returned home from the World Cup in Brazil on Wednesday afternoon . Falling short: Jack Wilshere was frank in his assessment of England's shortcomings at the World Cup, saying that youth is not an excuse for failure . Good age: Wilshere urged Raheem Sterling to continue his development as he moves from his teenage years into his twenties . 'Luke Shaw looked like he had played over a hundred games for his country. He was just natural. They showed in this tournament what they can do. But in the next tournament, we really have to deliver. ‘It’s a nice group of young players and hopefully we can stick together, learn from this, take all this disappointment and bottle it up. This is the worst feeling.’ Roy Hodgson’s squad returned home on Wednesday having not won in five games since they left for a training camp in Florida. They failed to live up to expectations that were at an all-time low and a summer of soul-searching begins. Like Wilshere, Phil Jones is 22 and another who can no longer hide in the ‘emerging’ category. Of Manchester United’s outfield players, only Patrice Evra and Wayne Rooney started more Barclays Premier League games last season. Natural: Wilshere praised Luke Shaw, saying his performance against Costa Rica made it seem like he had 100 caps for his country . Out of the frying pan: Manager Roy Hodgson faces a long summer of soul-searching after England's abject performance since leaving for Brazil . There are feelings at Old Trafford that a player of terrific potential has not progressed as they hoped. Not helped by the fact that Jones is prone to accidents and unsure of his best position. ‘I’d like to go back to the club and cement a regular place,’ he said. ‘I’ve said in the past few years that sometimes it doesn’t really affect me but it is nice to cement a regular place. Hopefully I can do that. ‘It’s for the manager to decide the position I play. You’ve seen me play centre back, right back and the holding role in midfield. Obviously, I think I’m an out-and-out defender. ‘I’m happy to play anywhere for Manchester United. That’s for the manager to decide.’ It is a big season for Jones under new United boss Louis van Gaal and important for England that his manager restores some direction. Chris Smalling, 24, and Danny Welbeck, 23, fall into the same bracket. VIDEO England has bright future - Juninho . Solid, if unspectacular: Phil Jones hopes his versatility can impress new Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal . Time to deliver: Chris Smalling, who played for England against Costa Rica, must perform more consistently for Manchester United next season . Neymar, Mario Gotze, James Rodriguez and Thibaut Courtois have supported Wilshere’s point that players can deliver influential performances at 22. PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor spoke on Wednesday of the need for firmer ‘home-grown’ quotas. The Premier League argue that investment must be made by the FA at grassroots level to produce more skilful young players to compete with those from abroad and that if they are good enough they will break into the first teams. It is the ideological clash at the heart of the English game. Sir Trevor Brooking steps down after more than a decade in charge of development and coaching education, during which time the Premier League has become stronger and the FA has been bullied in the club-versus-country struggles at all age levels. Golden Boy: Brazilian sensation Neymar, 22, has already scored four goals at the finals . Influential: Colombia's James Rodriguez, 22, has scored three times at the finals so far . Meanwhile England’s tournament results have bombed and the senior team appear unaware what it takes to win a competitive game. Brooking’s duties will be absorbed into the realm of Dan Ashworth, the FA’s director of elite development. Will that reverse the tide? Who knows? England, who started the World Cup somewhat generously ranked 10th, can expect to be overtaken by a pack including Holland, Chile, Belgium, Greece, France, Mexico and possibly even Costa Rica. Rankings will matter next year when they affect the 2018 World Cup qualifying draw. If England wallow outside Europe’s top 10 they are likely to be thrown into a group with a team such as Germany, Holland or Spain. So Hodgson needs his young stars to develop. His instinct is to shield them but the hype intensifies when a country produces such a small number of players at the required standard. When a dozen per year emerge, demanding international recognition, then the hype will be diluted. Stepping down: Sir Trevor Brooking (left) is leaving his post as Director of Football Development after 10 years at the helm . Slipping down: England, who entered the World Cup 10th in the FIFA rankings, will be overtaken by a number of teams after the tournament . England need Shaw, Barkley, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, John Stones and Sterling to mature and improve, coping with the sort of set-backs which have hit Wilshere and Jones since their days as teenage sensations. More than that, Hodgson must hope these players are not anomalies but represent the start of a new cycle; that more high-grade young footballers with an appetite to reach the top are produced by club academies. Evidence for this is not overwhelming. He also needs those such as Wilshere and Jones back on track. At least they are showing the right attitude. Soldiering on: Wilshere knows he has a very important season ahead for Arsenal and England . The Arsenal man plans a short holiday before reporting back to his club, in an effort to keep fit. ‘I’ll go back early,’ said Wilshere. ‘I’m not sure I’ll go away with the team (to the USA) but my fitness is on the way up and I don’t want to lose that. It’s a big season for me, a big season for Arsenal.’ It’s a big season for England, too.","As England return from Brazil, Arsenal star admits World Cup negatives .

'I've learned how painful it is to build up your hopes, to see a lot of good preparation proved to be to no avail because it didn't get us where we wanted,' he said. 'I've realised that, at this top level in a World Cup, it's unforgiving. A moment really of sheer misfortune can throw everyone into a realm of despair that you didn't know was possible.

Roy Hodgson and his doomed squad limp on to Belo Horizonte on Monday, a city which has become synonymous with World Cup embarrassment and humiliation in the lexicon of English football. Sixty-four years ago it was a bunch of amateurs from the United States who stunned the world and jolted England from its lofty status as a global power based on the fact it had invented the game. This time it is Costa Rica  limbering up to bring England down a further peg or two.

Paulo Wanchope, the former Derby, West Ham and Manchester City striker who is the assistant manager of Los Ticos, warned that his players are inspired to beat England despite the fact they have already qualified for the last 16.

He has one year left on his contract at Craven Cottage but it is hard to see him  returning to Fulham following the club’s relegation to the Championship. Having started to fulfil his huge potential on loan at Olympiacos, Arsenal’s Joel Campbell has another chance to prove to Arsene Wenger that he might worth a chance at the Emirates Stadium. Costa Rica will not be lacking confidence or motivation when they line up against England in the iconic Mineirao Stadium, home to Cruzeiro, the reigning champions of Brazil. It was not the same venue where Walter Winterbottom’s team were beaten 1-0 by the USA in 1950 — that was at Atletico Mineiro’s Independencia Stadium — but it is the same city and the parallels will haunt Hodgson and his team if they do not get out of Belo Horizonte without a point, at the very least. England have never left a World Cup finals without a point. VIDEO City Guide: Belo Horizonte .","Costa Rican players want to earn a place in the Premier League .

Steven Gerrard blamed the crushing defeat against Uruguay on England’s gung-ho quest for a glorious winner in Sao Paulo and admitted it was time to pray for help from Italy.

We can’t give chances to Luis Suarez because he buries them from that position. It’s a really tough moment for everyone in the dressing room but we need to be professional, keep fighting and pray for that score-line to go for us. 'It is frustrating. Looking at the two games and how we performed, we sort of deserved something out of either one of them if not both of them. I don’t think I’m standing here saying we were poor in both games and our game-plan was wrong. 'I just thought when we got the equaliser today we just needed to be a bit more clever, a bit more cute and a bit more difficult to beat. Maybe we should accept that going for a point might have been the best option. But they were weak at the back and they were there for the taking. Once we got the equaliser we tried to use the initiative to get the second.' Suarez struck first with a header from a wonderful cross by Edinson Cavani in the 39th minute.

When he was about to win his 100th cap, he was asked to rate his own international career and gave himself a six before, after a pause, upping it to a seven. All at sixes and sevens; it sums up 21st Century England, Gerrard’s generation, and they were much the same on Thursday night. They fared no better in the winter chill of Sao Paulo than in the jungle sweat-box of Manaus. There was in fact less to admire in terms of flair and attacking promise than against Italy.

After . surviving the early Uruguayan assault, England were beaten by a simple . long ball down the middle and a very good finish from a very good . finisher, who somehow escaped the attentions of everyone.

Manchester United starlet Reece James is under consideration for a call-up to the England Under-21 side after impressing on the club’s pre-season tour of the United States. Sportsmail understands that James, 20, is being monitored closely by FA scouts and could be part of Gareth Southgate’s squad to face Lithuania and Moldova in September if he maintains his remarkable progress. James, who grew up in Bacup in Lancashire, is yet to represent his country at youth level and a call-up by Southgate next month would cap a remarkable rise for the young left back. England ambitions: Reece James is in line for a call up to the England Under-21s squad . Showing promise: James looked good on United's tour of the States which has boosted his international hopes . Only two years ago, James’ career in English football looked to be under threat when he was released by Preston North End as an 18-year-old but the player was handed a lifeline by United’s reserve team manager Warren Joyce. The Reds had been aware of James for some time as his brother Matty James - who now plays for Leicester - was previously on their books. Over the last two seasons, the player’s development has encouraged United coaches. James made more appearances for the United second-string than any other player last season and he was nominated by Joyce for the club’s Denzil Haroun Reserves’ Player of the Year trophy. Big boys: James poses with Shinji Kagawa and Ashley Young in Denver as part of the club's US tour . Following the departures of Patrice Evra and Alex Buttner this summer, James was invited by Louis van Gaal to be part of the United squad in the USA and he has emerged as a viable understudy for Luke Shaw in the left-wing back position in the Dutchman’s favoured 3-5-2 system. The pair will also face competition from Ashley Young but James stated his case loud and clear in America, scoring twice against LA Galaxy and also impressing in the victory over Roma. England scouts are thought to have been impressed by how quickly James has adapted to life under Van Gaal at Old Trafford and his rapid progress could now result in the ultimate honour of representing his country.

Scholes outlined his potential as a broadcaster in a surprise punditry appearance on Sky Sports when Manchester United sank to a 3-0 defeat against Manchester City at Old Trafford in March.

Last Tuesday, at the dingy Merseyrail Community Stadium, the home of Conference side Southport, the curtain came down on Bebe’s peculiar career at Manchester United. Having underwhelmed once more for the reserve team, he was substituted after 45 minutes but emerged early from Warren Joyce’s half-time dressing down and took his place on the substitute’s bench. It was there that supporters asked the Portuguese winger if he would be leaving this summer and with a big grin, Bebe brazenly replied: ‘I go, I go, I go’. VIDEO Scroll down to watch a selection of Bebe's amazing goals on loan last season . New boy: Bebe gives a thumbs up after completing his move from Manchester United to Benfica . Down and out: Bebe plays against Southport in his last ever game for Manchester United . Fast-forward 72 hours and he was gone. Incredibly, for a player that did not start a Premier League match in four years at Old Trafford, United received £2.3million from Benfica and they are entitled to 50 per cent of any future fee that the Portuguese side receive. In truth, it is a handsome return for a player who, sadly, never really belonged at Old Trafford, written off within six months by Sir Alex Ferguson and shunned immediately by David Moyes and Louis van Gaal. Certain things, however, should be made clear. First, that Bebe, aged just 20 when he joined, does not deserve this notoriety. His story is, to an extent, an inspiring tale of a young boy who lived rough on the streets of Lisbon and came to play for one of the world’s most famous football clubs. It is the stuff of Hollywood films, as Bebe was plucked from the wilderness and handed a place at Casa do Gaiato, a charity-funded orphanage in Loures. Invisible: Bebe never started a single Premier League match despite signing for £7.5m in 2010 . Here was a player without even a Wikipedia profile, earning just £12,000 a year with Portuguese third division club Estrela, who had performed at the Homeless World Cup and now, here he was, playing for Manchester United. If we take away the gross misjudgement by United for a moment and assess this on a purely humane level, for Bebe to be wearing the jersey of Manchester United was something quite remarkable, even if there was to be no fairy-tale ending in a red shirt. Bebe’s contribution to United is encapsulated in a three minute YouTube clip called ‘The Bebe Crossing Show’, where a an appearance against Wolves descended into ridicule as attempted cross after attempted cross flew straight into the stands. On that day, Bebe, on as a substitute was himself substituted. Distracted: Sources at the club suggested Bebe lost his focus due to attention from fans and media . Transfer: Benfica paid £2.3m for Bebe, and Manchester United will also get 50 per cent of any future fee . 2010/11: Signs for £7.5m after being recommended by Carlos Quieroz. Plays 74 minutes of football. 2011/12: Loaned to Besiktas, plays less than an hour of competitive football all season. 2012/13: Loaned to Rio Ave, makes 17 appearances ad scores one goal. 2013/14: Loaned to Pacos de Ferreira, plays 27 times and scores 13 times. 2014/15: Sold to Benfica for £2.3m . Sources at Old Trafford noted that the fame disorientated Bebe a touch and he was taken in by the bright lights of Manchester. His application in training, he later admitted himself, was not up to scratch although United coaches would also point out that his technical deficiencies meant he may already have been a lost cause. Clearly, though, United saw something at some stage to convince them to pay the £7.4m buyout clause to release Bebe from a 5-year contract at Guimaraes in the summer of 2010. United scouts had spotted him scoring goals in pre-season for his new side but it later emerged that Bebe was available for just £125,000 five weeks earlier at his previous club Estrela. There has been much chin-wagging and conspiracy theories over the role of super-agent Jorge Mendes in the deal but it was another Portuguese man, Carlos Quieroz, that convinced Sir Alex Ferguson and David Gill to commit to the purchase, despite the United manager having never seen Bebe play, either live or on the television. Quieroz, the highly valued assistant of Ferguson for several years, provided a glowing recommendation. New boy: Bebe playing in the Eusebio Cup for new team Benfica against Ajax on the weekend . As it transpired, it was a reckless gamble by United but Bebe has gone some way to repairing his reputation in Portugal. Last season, he scored 13 goals for Pacos Ferreira in the Portuguese top-flight, an impressive return for a side that finished second from bottom. In Portugal, the narrative of their post World Cup post-mortem involved much consternation at the decision to overlook Bebe in their squad for Brazil. In his homeland, at least, Bebe is now taken seriously. It is a far cry from the days when United supporters at reserve games would sing, only half-in-jest: ‘If Bebe scores, we’re on the pitch.’ Bebe may afford himself a wry smile when he realises that he will be playing Champions League football this season while United are not. Benfica, the biggest club in Portugal and regular challengers in Europe, are no small-fry outfit and for them to hand Bebe a four-year contract, they clearly sense some of the potential that Quieroz identified now coming to fruition.","Bebe played his last game for Manchester United against Southport .

In the dominant victory in Louis van Gaal’s first match in charge of the club in Los Angeles, Herrera earned the man-of-the-match award after a performance of poise and creativity in the United midfield, linking up almost telepathically with his compatriot Juan Mata.

This was as many as any United midfielder managed in the Premier League throughout the whole of last season, with the exception of Juan Mata, who created four after signing for the club from Chelsea in the January transfer window. Herrera’s three assists equalled the tallies of Antonio Valencia, Adnan Januzaj and Shinji Kagawa from the duration of United’s traumatic Premier League season, with the club slumping to 7th position. Herrera, in one match, also dwarfed the single assists registered by under-performers such as Marouane Fellaini and Ashley Young while players including Nani, Darren Fletcher, Anderson, Ryan Giggs and Michael Carrick all failed to create a goal for a team-mate in the 2013/14 campaign. United will hope that the £28.4m Herrera will go some way to correcting the creativity deficit that has seemed to be behind so much of United’s toil in recent times.

In the next few weeks, almost half of the Barclays Premier League’s clubs will make the journey across the Atlantic, planting their flag into American soil and reaping the financial rewards of their money-spinning adventures. It is, of course, consummate timing. The World Cup proved to be a moment in time for American soccer, an inflection point, when Jurgen Klinsmann’s endearing side received the blessing of the White House and attracted hundreds of thousands to stage public screenings. As Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham, Aston Villa, Stoke City, Swansea City and Crystal Palace feel the buzz in the coming weeks, the marketing gurus will claim a moment of masterly foresight but surely few could have predicted World Cup would have such a transformative impact on the standing of soccer in the States this summer. Across the pond: Man Utd are one of many Premier League clubs currently on tour in the USA . Living in Beverley Hills: Wayne Rooney out and about in California . Fresh off the plane: Ander Herrera and Juan Mata on their arrival in the US . The signposts of potential have, however, been emerging in recent times. Viewing figures on NBC, the American channel broadcasting Premier League football last year, have struck a cord with club executives, with a record 31.5m Americans tuning in to watch the coverage last season, more than doubling the audience from the previous campaign. Research has illustrated that soccer is now the second most popular sport to watch among the kids of the USA. Swansea, for example, were taken aback to discover that their 3-0 victory over Cardiff was the most watched game on American TV last season. Crystal Palace featured in two of the top ten matches, including their 3-1 victory over Sunderland, indicating that it is not only the big-hitters who are drawing attention. The idea that a group of excitable American youngsters are ditching their baseball and basketball for a peek at Tony Pulis and Gary Monk is peculiar, to say the least, but on this evidence, it is little wonder that both Swansea and Palace have dipped their toes into American waters this summer. For the leading clubs, the attraction is more straightforward. Home away from home: Liverpool played Roma in a friendly at Fenway Park . In training: Daniel Sturridge and Jordan Henderson in action at Harvard University . Chilled out: Steven Gerrard opts for the flip flop look as he strolls across the pitch during half time at Fenway Park . The US market is evolving and they refuse to miss out. The US ownership of Manchester United, with the Glazer family and Liverpool, with the Fenway group, clearly has an influence but there is now no disguising the potential across the pond. Even Arsene Wenger, for so long averse to these long-haul trips, has had to relent, with Arsenal making their first visit to the USA for 25 years. When they last visited, less than 10,000 turned out for a match in Miami. It will be a very different story when they line up against Thierry Henry and the New York Red Bulls on Saturday evening. Manchester United’s executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has long believed that the US market has been neglected and they, as a club, have begun to prioritise it as the number one region for growth. Clearly, limitations remain. Manchester United’s evisceration of LA Galaxy, a team that won the MLS only a few years ago, suggests that the accelerated development of the US game may have left the football itself trailing in its wake. Minnows: Even smaller clubs like Swansea have journeyed across to cash in, playing Minnesota United . Acceptance: Even Arsene Wenger has relented in journeying to the new market, here with Steve Bould at the Red Bull Arena in New Jersey . Baller: Aaron Ramsey at a fans party at the Izod Centre in New Jersey . Selfie time: Mathieu Flamini, Jack Wilshere and Tomas Rosicky enjoy the view of the city . Louis van Gaal has already revealed his anxieties, suggesting that such travelling is not conducive to preparation for a gruelling campaign in English football. This much is common sense and it is the way that many Premier League managers have always felt. One, Jose Mourinho, has placed his foot on the brakes this year, convincing the hierarchy that a trip to Austria and matches in Holland, Slovenia and Hungary will suffice as his players recover from the strain and intensity of a World Cup in the energy-sapping heat of Brazil. If Chelsea are leading the chasing pack by a canter come the turn of the year, we may see a number of Premier League managers knocking on the doors of their employers and asking to follow Mourinho’s example. Money, however, is the most powerful voice in football, as Van Gaal and co may discover. For others, it is a game of catch-up. Manchester City are still emerging as a global force but the outlook is overwhelmingly positive. It will be a sad day when football is judged by the spreadsheet but in the corridors of power, they are were encouraged by the latest financial report that showed the club’s YouTube channel received more than double the hits than Barcelona and Real Madrid last year and that almost half of the club’s website views came from abroad. Now, they are spreading their wings. The New York City venture, with Frank Lampard and David Villa in tow, will attract capacity attendances and similar projects are underway in Australia and Japan. New venture: Frank Lampard has joined new side New York City FC . First man: Alongside David Villa, who was the first player to sign for the new club . The Asian market remains vital and we should remember that United, Arsenal, City and Liverpool all jetted to the Far East or South East Asia last summer. City, in particular, were left reeling by the state of the pitch and facilities when they played in a tournament with Sunderland and Tottenham. On that day, Matija Nastasic picked up a serious-looking injury and in truth, the bog-bath resembled a flashback to Match of the Day in the 1970’s, with players were slipping and sliding through pools of standing water. One of the attractions of the USA is the abundance of flawless recreational complexes, with leading universities, such as Harvard, offering accommodation and pristine training pitches. This, for the sceptical managers, should offer some comfort but it will only be when management and boardrooms come together in January to organise next year’s tours when we fully discover where priorities lie.","Almost half of the Premier League will journey to the USA this summer .

"By . Adam Crafton . Follow @@AdamCrafton_ . At the beginning of his Friday morning pre-match press conferences, Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini habitually ticks off his injury list. Last season, it often went something like this. ‘Micah Richards, Matija Nastastic, Jack Rodwell, Sergio Aguero.’ A voice would then pop up from the assembled press: ‘And Stevan Jovetic?’ ‘Yes, Stevan, I’m not sure, maybe a couple of weeks.’ Hit and miss: Manchester City's Stevan Jovetic is looking to impress after struggling last season . This, sadly, was the narrative of Stevan Jovetic’s first season in England, the £22.4million signing from Fiorentina seeing his campaign punctuated by a series of muscle of injuries with a return date often hazy. It all began with a hamstring problem suffered in pre-season and then came subsequent problems of a similar kind, along with calf strains and groin problems, limiting Jovetic to just two Premier League starts. In public, Pellegrini pleaded for tolerance but behind the scenes, City could have been forgiven for wondering whether it was a psychological battle as well as a physical one for Jovetic. Certainly, the Montenegrin was unlucky. On one scheduled return date in a Capital One Cup match at Leicester, he . was struck down by a bout of food poisoning. Frustrated figure: Jovetic just made five starts last season in all competitions due to injuries and illness . Welcome sight: Jovetic's (left) struggles were to the chagrin of City manager Manuel Pellegrini (right) Nonetheless, when Sergio Aguero suffered a series of set-backs in the second half of the season, and Alvaro Negredo dramatically lost his gloascoring touch, it was Edin Dzeko that emerged from the shadows, with Jovetic worthy only of seven substitute appearances between the end of February and May. Evidently, the Montenegrin has a way to go to regain the trust of Pellegrini. The manager’s apparent reservations are understandable. To strip Jovetic’s career at City down to the bare numbers, it makes for uncomfortable reading. So far, Jovetic has played just 579 minutes in the light blue of Manchester City. That works out at £38,687 per minute. He is yet to play more than 65 minutes in a single Premier League game. The only 90 minutes he did complete came in a 5-0 victory over Wigan in the Capital One Cup. Jovetic started just five games in all competitions last season. For the record, that works out at £4.48m per game. Unreliable? Jovetic (centre) made seven substitute appearances for City between February and May . In one match against Stoke, he came on in the 56th minute and limped off after 69 minutes. In another at Newcastle, he managed just 10 minutes before succumbing to injury. In Italy, they nicknamed him Jo-Jo and times last season, some City fans may have feared that his time at the Etihad Stadium would end up as inauspicious as that of the Brazilian Jo, the former club record signing that scored just six goals for the club. Yet when several Italian clubs came calling for Jovetic this summer, principally Inter Milan, City rejected the approaches without a second’s hesitation. Still got it: Jovetic (left) scored twice for City in their 5-1 pre-season friendly win against AC Milan on Sunday . VIDEO Pellegrini delighted at rampant City . And on Sunday evening in the United States, Jovetic reminded everybody just why sporting director Txiki Begiristain and Pellegrini were so keen to retain him. Albeit only pre-season and against an AC Milan team who appeared to be taking their inspiration for defending from Brazil’s World Cup side, Jovetic dazzled, scoring twice and it would have been three if not for the linesman’s offside flag. Speaking before the game, Pellegrini said: ‘Stevan is working well with us. He is a very important player for our team. Maybe there are a lot of rumours about his future but Stevan will stay with us.’ Still only 24, City believe they have one of the world’s most talented forwards on their books and they hope that their perseverance will be rewarded with the kind of performances that saw Jovetic compared to Roberto Baggio and Gianfranco Zola in Italy and named as Partizan Belgrade’s youngest ever captain, aged 18, just a few years ago. If, and it remains a significant if, Jovetic is able to stay fit, City’s patience could yet be repaid in spectacular fashion.

Here, Sportsmail's Adam Crafton runs the rule over the youngster. Why are we interested in this young man? Iheanacho played almost the full game as Manchester City began their tour of the USA with a 4-1 victory over Sporting Kansas City. He scored a late goal with an accomplished finish and produced an eye-catching performance. On the scoresheet: Iheanacho (right) celebrates his goal against Sporting Kansas City on Thursday . So, how old is he and where did City find him? Iheanacho is just 17-years-old and he is a product of the Right to Dream Academy in Ghana. It is a registered charity that has been providing underprivileged African footballers with the opportunity for elite training programmes and international education. City have a positive relationship with the set-up and another forward, Godsway Donyoh, signed for City from there in January. It seems, then, that City have great hopes for the young playmaker? They certainly do. He joined the squad on the trip to Scotland for games against Dundee and Hearts and was then invited into Manuel Pellegrini's 23-man squad for the tour of the United States. Another Nigerian Chidiebere Nwakali, also went to Scotland. Bag of tricks: Iheanacho slaloms past a couple of Kansas City challenges . High hopes: The Nigerian attacking midfielder has been tipped for big things in the future . Iheanacho sounds like quite a player, then? At the Under 17 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates last year, he scored six goals in seven matches, winning the Silver Boot as the second highest goalscorer and the Golden Ball as the best player. After scoring for Manchester City on Thursday, Manuel Pellegrini said: ‘Kelechi is just 17 years old and he’s a very important player for us in the future. He demonstrated today what he can do in the future. It depends on the way he takes this profession, but I think he’s a good talent. He’s a very important player for the future for the club.' Can we expect to see him in the first-team soon? Possibly not. City are looking into whether they can secure a work permit for Iheanacho but they may have to loan him out to a club overseas until he is eligible to play in England. Knocking on the door: But Iheanacho may find himself sent out on loan next season .

City believe that Seko Fofana, a young Frenchman, was racially abused by an opponent during a pre-season warm-up match against HNK Rijeka on Tuesday evening. For his troubles, the teenager was sent off, having kicked out after receiving a verbal volley of abuse from his Croatian opponent moments before half-time. As of Wednesday morning, City were still to ascertain how much the referee had seen or heard of the incident. Elite Development Squad manager Patrick Vieira, once alerted to Fofana's complaint, immediately entered the pitch and after holding discussions with the referee and the City officials present, the former Arsenal captain ordered his players to leave the field and asserted that the game would not continue. It is the most high-profile statement that an English football club has made against racism in recent times and while City were keen to stress that this was a club decision, rather than Vieira's alone, they will know that this decision will reverberate around Europe. Vieira, a mild-mannered and deeply intelligent man who is aware of his status as one of football's leading statesmen, will not have taken this decision lightly. Sadly, the incident appears to have been brushed aside by the Croatian club. Move along, nothing to see here appears to be the depressing message. Youngster: Fofana in action during an Under-21 match against Chelsea last season at the Etihad . On their . club website, Rijeka suggested that City, trailing 1-0 at the time of . the incident, simply could not handle the embarrassment of falling . behind against a relatively unknown side. The . bizarre defence continued with the assertion that the red card was . 'entirely justified' and on Vieira's actions, Rijeka said: 'To the . amazement of a well-filled stadium he took his team off the pitch. What . are the reasons? They are known only to him.' There is no mention of the alleged incident of racism and no suggestion that the Croatian side will launch an internal investigation. Sportsmail understands that City are in talks with the match organisers and the Croatian FA to take matters further. Back at the hotel in Croatia on Tuesday night, City officials were understood to be incensed by the development and hugely frustrated by this latest case of racism. The EDS side and under-18 side have enjoyed two very happy years at their Croatian training camp and only last Friday, the academy head Mark Allen was telling local journalists and the complex manager that he would consider a return to the base for a third summer next year. He may now be tempted to place a black marker through Croatia's name when deciding future destinations. As for Fofana, the talented midfielder was understood to be deeply distressed on Tuesday night. If, as City unequivocally maintain, he was racially abused, you can understand why a young teenager may respond angrily, even if it is not the ideal reaction to lash out. Hurt: Devante Cole, son of former England striker Andrew, was allegedly racially abused by players and fans . Match winner: Cole scored the winning goal as City advanced into the last eight of the UEFA competition . Claim: Gael Clichy tweeted saying bananas were thrown on to the pitch in a friendly for Man City .

On their . club website, Rijeka suggested that City, trailing 1-0 at the time of . the incident, simply could not handle the embarrassment of falling . behind against a relatively unknown side. The defence continued with the assertion that the red card was . 'entirely justified' and on Vieira's actions, Rijeka said: 'To the . amazement of a well-filled stadium he took his team off the pitch. What . are the reasons? They are known only to him.' Certainly, . it is out of character for a charming individual who makes for good . company. Vieira rates him among the club's most promising talents. He . will comfort the young man and take him under his wing as the group fly . back to Manchester on Wednesday afternoon but there is no disguising the . anger that has engulfed the players and staff at Manchester City. Just . a few months ago, Devante Cole, the son of Andrew, was the victim of . perhaps the most revolting torrent of racial abuse encountered by an . English footballer in recent times. During a UEFA Youth League match at . Atletico Madrid, monkey chants came streaming down from the stands and . he also received abuse from opposing players. Even a tannoy announcement pleading for a ceasefire could not deter the stream of bile being directed his way. As he exited the field at full-time, shielded by academy head Mark Allen, Cole was then spat at. He was 18-years-old at the time. 'You cannot believe what it was like. Just disgusting. He was really upset by it. He was 18 - how can it be allowed?' a City source told Sportsmail. UEFA saw it worthy only of a fine of £8,270 for Atletico and a partial stadium ban for a future youth game. In October last year, monkey chants were directed towards Yaya Toure in last season's Champions League clash in Russia and the same kind of alleged derogatory noises aimed at Mario Balotelli during a Europa League match against Porto in 2012. Making his feelings clear: Yaya Toure tells referee Ovidiu Hategan about the abuse from CSKA Moscow fans . What's going on? Toure gestures towards the fans after the midfielder felt he was being racially abused . Time to act: Toure called on UEFA to take action against fans who racially abuse players . Target: Toure was the victim of monkey chants from sections of the Moscow crowd during the game . Porto were fined only £16,700 for the behaviour of their supporters - less than the £24,000 City were fined for returning to the field a minute late after half time, while CSKA were punished with only a partial closure of their stadium. This will not be a case for UEFA but the meek punishments set a poor precedent. Who can forget Michel Platini's response to the suggestion that Mario Balotelli should walk off the pitch if he were to receive racial abuse at Euro 2012: ‘If a player left the field on his own, he would get a yellow card. It’s not Mr Balotelli who’s in charge of refereeing,' was the UEFA President's pithy reply. You get the drift. Nobody here is expecting the Croatian governing body to come down like a ton of bricks on one of their own. Yet when the authorities continue to turn a blind eye, when UEFA's punishments remain tame and when FIFA award World Cups to countries such as Russia, where prejudice remains rife, racism will remain unchallenged on the continent. Angry: Mario Balotelli punches the ground during an Italy game where he was allegedly racially abused as well . Bad day: Balotelli was supposedly subject to monkey noises during the international game as well .","Manchester City's Elite Development Squad manager Patrick Vieira abandoned pre-season friendly against HNK Rijeka after incident .

Patrick Vieira walked his Manchester City players off the pitch in the middle of a game after Under-21 midfielder Seko Fofana was allegedly the victim of racial abuse during a pre-season match in Croatia on Tuesday. Vieira's Elite Development Side are currently on a 10-day pre-season training camp in Novigrad and they demanded that the match against HNK Rijeka was postponed after an opposing player allegedly racially insulted Fofana, a 19-year-old Frenchman. Vieira entered the field to talk to the referee before taking his players off the pitch. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manuel Pellegrini fully supports Patrick Vieira and Seko Fofana .

The incident took place . just before the half-time break. The decision to postpone the match was a unilateral one taken by the management staff present and Vieira is understood to be unequivocal in his backing of the young player, who is said to have been left deeply distressed by the incident. A club statement on Tuesday evening read: 'Manchester City's EDS U21 game with HNK Rijeka has today been cancelled due to an alleged incident of racial abuse toward the Club's young midfielder, Seko Fofana by a member of the opposing team. 'Following an alleged incident in the latter stages of the first half of the game, being played in Novigrad, Croatia, a decision was taken by the management staff to withdraw the City team from the field of play and cancel the game. 'Club representatives in Croatia and in Manchester are liaising with officials, the match organisers and the Croatian Football Association to pursue this matter further.' HNK Rijeka, however, appear to have distanced themselves from speculation that one of their players made racist comments towards Fofana. A statement on their website read: 'Manchester City coach Patrick Vieira entered the field, something was discussed with the referee, and then to the amazement of a well-filled stadium he took his team off the pitch. What are the reasons? They are known only to him.' City are incensed after this became the fourth case of alleged racist abuse directed towards one of their players in the last two years and privately they are furious that more is not being done to tackle backwards atttitudes on the continent.

Stepping in: After the incident, Man City coach Patrick Vieira stepped in to have the game cancelled . Only in March, fellow EDS player Devante Cole, the son of former Manchester United player Andrew, was the victim of racial abuse during a UEFA Youth League match at Atletico Madrid. The player was targeted by players and supporters, and is understood to have even be spat at as he left the field. Even a tannoy announcement made during the game did not stem the tide of bile aimed at Cole. UEFA's response was a fine of just €10,000 euros and a partial closure of their youth stadium for a future game. It also follows the alleged monkey chants by CSKA Moscow supporters directed towards Yaya Toure in last season's Champions League clash in Russia and the same kind of alleged derogatory noises aimed at Mario Balotelli during a Europa League match against Porto in 2012. Porto were fined only £16,700 for the behaviour of their supporters while CSKA were punished with only a partial closure of their stadium.

He then returned from the dressing-room before the majority of the other United players, where he posed for photographs with supporters and signed autographs. An eye-witness told Sportsmail that when Bebe was asked by fans whether he would be staying at the club, he clearly stated: 'I go, I go.' Bebe, who signed for United in an explicable £7million deal in 2010, is not part of Louis van Gaal's plans at Old Trafford. He has not started a single Premier League match in his four years with the club and Sir Alex Ferguson even went on record to admit that he had not seen the player play when he rubber-stamped the deal. Bebe was not invited to join the pre-season tour of the USA and United are looking for a buyer for the forward and Benfica are understood to be the favourites to secure his signature with a deal believed to have been agreed in principle between the Portuguese club and the player. Meanwhile, Tom Lawrence, one of the youngsters handed a debut by Ryan Giggs towards the end of last season is understood to have agreed a new long-term contract with the club. His previous deal expired this summer but United have convinced the 20-year-old to remain Old Trafford despite interest from a host of Premier League and Championship clubs, including Southampton and Newcastle.

Southampton intend to pursue their policy of signing young English talent with a double swoop for move for Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster and Norwich winger Nathan Redmond. The south coast side are attempting to reconstruct their squad following the departures of Luke Shaw to Manchester United and Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and soon, Dejan Lovren, to Liverpool. Manager Ronald Koeman is happy to remain true to the club's philosophy of mostly signing ambitious English youngsters to play alongside academy products. Wanted: Southampton are set to move for Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster . Targeted: They have also been linked with a move for Nathan Redmond of Norwich . Southampton are understood to have already been rebuffed in initial attempts to secure both Forster and Redmond but they have resolved to return for the pair. Staff at Southampton are unsure over Artur Boruc after several erratic moments last season and new goalkeeping coach Dave Watson has recommended Forster, who could cost up to £9million, as an alternative. England goalkeeping coach Watson has worked with Forster with the national team, for whom the 26-year-old is Roy Hodgson's third choice stopper. Uncertain: They remain unconvinced by current first choice Artur Boruc . Linked: They are also considering a move for Burnley forward Danny Ings . Meanwhile, Southampton have already seen a £3.5m approach for Redmond turned down but they believe that relegated Norwich will be tempted to part with the England under-21 international for a fee approaching £6.5m. Stoke, Everton and Swansea are also monitoring Redmond's situation at Carrow Road. Burnley forward Danny Ings also remains on the Saints' radar. He has only one left on his contract. The Lancashire club are determined to keep hold of the forward, who himself is not angling for a move, but the financial incentive of serious offer could prove too good to turn down.","Southampton targeting Celtic's Forster and Norwich's Redmond .

As Manchester United prepare to present Louis van Gaal to the media for the first time at Old Trafford on Thursday afternoon, the flashing cameras and assembled press will eagerly await the first sound bites from the famously confrontational Dutchman. Van Gaal is expected to reveal his blueprint for United’s present and future and Sportsmail can reveal a fascinating glimpse into the core principles that have guided him in a prestigious career that has boasted stints with Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. A fortnight before the World Cup, Van Gaal took to the stage in his native Holland, addressing an audience of business experts at ‘De Week van de ondernermer’ – The Week of the Businessman – where he outlined his coaching vision.

I do training, analysis and evaluation. That is what I believe in.' Visionary: Van Gaal refuted claims that he is arrogant but did concede that he has a clear idea of what he wants . Be prepared: The new Manchester United manager is big on everyone knowing their roles . 'I can’t do it on my own. Because I don’t know everything, do I? I know you start laughing, because I am portrayed continuously that I do know everything. I listen to specialists? Do you listen to your employees? They produce your stuff. 'Look here: The coaches, these are my staff. If I go back to what I believe in: Preparation, training, analysis, evaluation, than it all comes down to the use of my organisation! I have 12 members of staff who are working for me, who are preparing, training, analysing and evaluating for me. But I am the one who has to guide them, steer them in the right direction. 'We have two assistant coaches and a goalkeeper coach. So, including me as head coach, that is a group of four staff members who are just focusing on skills and tactics. And I have a total of 12, including all the others, physiologists, video analysts, etc. This is how important it is to work in my organisation so I can get the best product possible on the pitch. All together, there are 37 people in my staff. The leader: Despite listening to his staff and delegating, ultimately Van Gaal is still the boss . 'When I became national coach, the whole world thought I was going to pick the players who had to get us to the World Cup. No! First the staff! I always first pick my staff! I have to surround myself with good staff. We have to surround the players with quality staff. Why? It does not matter whether is a product, a tool, a machine, or knowledge you want to pass on to a big public, I always make sure that I have specialists in every department who advise me.'

In May, Seluk claimed Toure was ‘very upset’ that the club did not present him with a cake for his 31st birthday and also alleged that on a trip to Abu Dhabi, the club’s owners did not shake Toure’s hand. Seluk then asserted that it was ‘50-50’ whether the midfielder would remain at City next season, even though his contract runs until 2017. Toure, meanwhile, fluttered his eyelashes at Paris Saint-Germain and admitted a yearning to finish his playing days back at Barcelona. Following Ivory Coast’s exit from the World Cup, Toure — who had, in fact, been presented with two birthday cakes by City — made some rather more damaging allegations, suggesting the club did not allow him compassionate leave to spend time with his terminally ill brother Ibrahim, who died last month.

It is understood that City, who have always adopted a sensitive and paternal approach to players’ personal issues, offered Toure their full support, even helping with the funeral arrangements and overseeing the paperwork for the Toure family, after previously welcoming Ibrahim as a special guest at Carrington. City, for their part, have remained relaxed throughout. They recognise that Toure has been through a traumatic period following the death of his brother and they insist there have been no rows between the player and the club. Privately, they maintained that they would not countenance the departure of a player who earns in the region of £250,000 a week and last season scored 24 goals as City reclaimed the Barclays  Premier League crown. City head to the United States for their pre-season tour early next week but Toure, along with the other players knocked out in the group stages of the World Cup, will have an extra few days off. Meanwhile, Patrick Vieira, the coach for City’s elite development squad, suggested that ‘a lack of pure talent’ was the primary reason for England’s worst World Cup performance in 56 years. ‘For all the people who love England and love English football like I do, it was very disappointing,’ said the French World Cup winner. ‘The problem is more in the grassroots than in the club teams. I think it’s a lack of pure talent.’ Staying: Toure, and the other players knocked out in the group stages of the World Cup, have extra days off .","Yaya Toure will stay at Manchester City as midfielder says: 'I want to stay'

The rupture of relations between Manchester United and Nike will extend beyond a kit deal as the sportswear firm have decided to cut all ties with the club. Nike confirmed on Tuesday afternoon that they have withdrawn from negotiations with United to extend their 13-year association with the club after becoming frustrated by United’s financial demands. A Nike statement read: ‘Any partnership with a club or federation has to be mutually beneficial and the terms that were on offer for a renewed contract did not represent good value for Nike’s shareholders.’ Final showing: Nike's ties with Manchester United will end after the 2014/15 season . No rewarding value: Nike will not renew their 13-year deal with United, and it comes following a season where the Red Devils dropped out of Europe for the first time since 1990 . Where it all began: Nike's relationship with United began in 2002, as David Beckham celebrates scoring a Premier League goal against Charlton . The sponsorship began in 2002 and will end at the end of this season, meaning that United will continue to offer Nike merchandise and wear Nike manufactured kit and leisure-wear until 2015. Sportsmail has learned on Wednesday that the breaking off of relations also stretches to the Manchester United Soccer Schools, which were devised and jointly operated by the club and Nike . It also includes the sponsorship of the Manchester United Premier Cup, an Under 15 competition featuring over 8,000 teams, when one million of the world’s finest young talents come together every year. Sportsmail also understands that the majority of coaches in the soccer schools are recruited and contracted by Nike, casting doubt over their future prospects. A well-placed Nike source confirmed: . ‘The relationship continues until the end of the season and then Nike . will no longer be involved with United.’ Nike’s . refusal to cede to United’s demands clears the way for German firm . adidas to move in, with a 10-year deal worth in the region of . £750million understood to be under discussion.

As Louis van Gaal arrives at Manchester United's Carrington training ground on Wednesday morning, he will do so in the knowledge that he has just 31 days to repair the damage done by the David Moyes era before Swansea City arrive at Old Trafford to kick off the Premier League season. The Dutchman has already spoken of his desire to restore unity and togetherness into United's DNA. His Holland side at the World Cup was characterised as much by its defiant team spirit as it was by the flair of Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie. 'I hope the group in Manchester will become like this one,' Van Gaal said last weekend. VIDEO Scroll down to watch David Beckham: Van Gaal and Giggs is a special line-up . All together now: Van Gaal with his Holland squad after they won their third-place play-off against Brazil . New beginnings: The experienced Dutchman starts work at Manchester United this week . It would be unfair, however, to expect . an overnight transformation. Holland's determined World Cup campaign . was two years in the making. History suggests that Van Gaal's methods . are ultimately successful but they can take time to come into fruition. United supporters expecting a blockbuster beginning may be initially . underwhelmed. A Sportsmail study . into Van Gaal's last 17 years in club management offers a revealing . insight. More often than not, his teams start slowly. The Dutchman took . over at Bayern Munich in the summer of 2009. After 13 matches, Van Gaal . had won just five and his team were seventh towards the end of November. They failed to win their first three Champions League group stage . matches. By May, however, Bayern had discovered their form, winning the . Bundesliga and reaching the Champions League final, where Van Gaal was defeated by Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan. Timid starts are a surprising feature on . Van Gaal's CV, a similarity United fans may note between their new . manager and his illustrious predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson. Stepping in: Assistant manager Ryan Giggs has been leading United's double sessions this week . VIDEO Van Gaal can't wait to get started . At Dutch side AZ Alkmaar, Van Gaal achieved the . improbable by seeing off the usual contenders in Ajax and PSV to win the . Eredivisie in 2009. That triumph, however, followed consecutive defeats . at the beginning of the season by NAC Breda and Ado Den Haag. After 11 . matches, AZ were fourth. Even though his period in charge of . Ajax (1991-97) produced one of the most celebrated sides in the history . of the European game, it should be remembered that Van Gaal required . three seasons to win his first Eridivisie title with the Dutch club. His . first season in Catalonia was a success on the spreadsheet, winning the . league after an impressive start, with Barcelona second after 14 . games, but his style was greeted with dismay by the locals. Short stay: Van Gaal lasted less than two years at Bayern Munich despite winning the Bundesliga . Against the odds: Van Gaal issues instructions while at AZ, where he won the Eredivisie in 2009 . Writing in his book, Barca: A People's Passion, author Jimmy Burns recorded the feelings of supporters towards the end of his first season: 'The jury is out on Van Gaal, a Dutchman lacking the humanity of Bobby Robson and the popularity of Johan Cruyff, both of whose heads have rolled in the space of less than two years. 'Barca may be at the top of the league, but the fans are unconvinced. They have watched the team pathetically founder in Europe, while continuing to play lacklustre football in the League, winning seemingly by default rather than design.' Divisive: Van Gaal was not always popular at Barcelona despite delivering two titles . Protests: Barca fans show their feelings towards Van Gaal at the Nou Camp in 2000 . The La Liga title was sealed in 1998 and 1999, but once again teething problems caused near jaw-ache among the supporters. In December, Van Gaal's side were 10th after 14 games, having won only five. They would go on to win 19 of their next 24, winning the title once more. It is a familiar narrative with the man they call the Iron Tulip for his robust exterior and extraordinary levels of self-confidence. It is this self-belief that allows Van Gaal to persist when all around the club will criticise. His style does not appeal to everywhere, once triggering Bayern president Uli Hoeness to dismissively note: 'Louis van Gaal's problem is not that he is God but he's God's very own father. Louis was already there before the world even existed.' My way or the highway: The Dutchman is expected to lay down the law at Manchester United . At United, senior officials are excited by Van Gaal's bravado. Following the crisis of conviction suffered by Moyes, they believe that the Dutchman will bring a welcome change in attitude and results. United may be correct on both counts, but if history proves an accurate barometer, then a little bit of patience may be required before the silverware arrives.

"By . Derek Lawrenson . He showed up and played 18 holes, but there the good news endeth concerning Tiger Woods. If only there was an instant cure for his game to go with the one for his latest back problem. Instead, there was just more evidence of his alarming decline, vividly illustrated by the coarse shriek at his 11th hole as another drive sailed off line. ‘For ****’s sake, Tiger!’ he raged. It got worse — the golf that is, not the swearing. The swearing is always bad. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Woods making no excuses for poor day . One to forget: Tiger Woods finished the day three-over-par after a round of 74 at Valhalla . Uphill task: The American is planning to add the PGA Championship to his list of major titles . VIDEO Woods making no excuses for poor day . He hit a drive so far right on his 16th hole it was still rising when it cleared the gallery. It was so far off line it would have taken Usain Bolt seven or eight seconds to reach it from the middle of the fairway. ‘Is that OB?’ he asked playing partner Phil Mickelson, as in Out of Bounds. Woods ended with a 74 to be comfortably outside the top 100. There are times when he tries kidology and says things are progressing when plainly they are not. This was so bad he didn’t even try to pretend. ‘It wasn’t very good at all,’ he said. ‘I hit a lot of bad shots and couldn’t get my putts to the hole and that’s not a good combo.’ In the past he would have headed to the range to sort things out but that wasn’t possible. ‘I’m going to get treatment and make sure this thing is nice and loose tomorrow,’ he said. Actually, in the past, if Woods was this out of shape, he wouldn’t have showed up at all. Which begs the question: why is he here?

Off course: Woods is forced away from the fairway on the seventh hole . ‘If I get under par for two rounds, that will be right in the ball game,’ he said. Woods will not qualify for the four-tournament FedEx Cup series that follows and so has no more golf scheduled this side of the Ryder Cup. Not exactly a convincing argument for a wild card, is it? Woods was part of a three ball featuring Mickelson and Padraig Harrington; three men with no fewer than 22 major championships between them. A decade or so ago you’d have bet the mortgage that you were watching the eventual winner. Here, there was no evidence of that, even though Mickelson, by virtue of his prowess around the greens, somehow delivered a two-under 69. Harrington laboured to a 73. When it was over, Mickelson went to the media interview area and was asked about Woods (left). He smiled and thought for a second about what he could say. ‘I thought he showed a lot of heart,’ he remarked, eventually. That was about the sum of it.

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Amidst a sea of tense faces fretting over Ryder Cup places and loss of form, Rory McIlroy was a veritable beacon of tranquility at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone on Thursday. Earning a Claret Jug will do that for a man, as the 25-year-old threatened for most of his opening round to carry on from where he left off at Hoylake. As it turned out, an ugly double bogey from nowhere on his penultimate hole, the eighth on the card, turned an opening 67 that would have fairly reflected his play into a 69 that still left him decently placed, as he seeks the victory he needs to climb over Adam Scott and become world No 1 again. Open winner: Rory McIlroy was back in action at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and played some good golf . The leader at the end of the first day was another Aussie, Marc Leishman, who followed up his top five finish at The Open by shooting a 64. It gave him a one shot lead over American Ryan Moore and Charl Schwartzel from South Africa. Leading European was Scottish Open Champion Justin Rose, who shot 65. An indication of how relaxed McIlroy was came at the 17th, where the ringtone of a mobile playing a garish country song went off loudly just yards from where he happened to be ready to strike his tee shot. Imagine the reaction of most players? McIlroy never backed off, never blinked in fact. He just stuck to his routine and launched another howitzer on this uphill par four that came to earth fully 50 yards past the drive of his playing partner, Matt Kuchar. ‘I think I am driving the ball better than I ever have right now,’ said the 25 year old, and gave another prodigious demonstration at the 18th, where his tee shot on this 464-yard par four finished just 85 yards from the hole. Relaxed character: McIlroy waves to the crowd on a day where his round was ruined by a double bogey . Leader: Justin Rose is top of the leaderboard on day one after a round of 64 at Firestone . Tied third with two to play, the last thing expected was for McIlroy to thin a bunker shot and make a hash of his next blow as well, after his ball had finished against a collar of rough. ‘I said beforehand that I wanted to ride the momentum of my Open win and I thought I did that apart from the 8th,’ said McIlroy. ‘Other than that hole, I played pretty well.’ This is one of only two big events left to decide the automatic Ryder Cup places on both sides of the Atlantic and boy, can you tell. Welshman Jamie Donaldson, one of those sweating on a spot, summed it up nicely when he said: ’You want to forget about it but all the time you’ve got this voice at the back of your mind nagging away and reminding you what’s at stake.’ Lining it up: Victory would see the Northern Irishman become world No 1, climbing above Adam Scott . It would be desperately harsh if the 38 year old Welshman missed out on a Gleneagles debut now after being in the frame for virtually all the qualifying period but it could still happen, and particularly after missing the halfway cut at the Scottish Open and The Open. To that end, a two under par 68 that left him handily placed in the top ten was a gusty effort. One shot nearer the lead held by American Ryan Moore and South African Charl Schwartzel following rounds of 65 was in-form Italian Frankie Molinari, currently 13th in the standings but who could leap into the automatic spots with a top two finish. Luke Donald is presently clinging to the last automatic slot and left the door firmly ajar with his disappointing opening round of 73. Scot Stephen Gallacher, presently 10th in the standings, couldn’t take advantage, posting a 74. Lee Westwood, another who needs a big week, shot 72.

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Cold logic suggests he has got no chance. Conventional golfing wisdom points towards him using the 143rd Open Championship at Royal Liverpool as a chance to get some competitive rounds under his belt before a serious tilt at the season’s final major, the US PGA Championship in three weeks. So what happened when the big question came, and what would be an acceptable performance this week? Tiger Woods settled for a one-word answer: ‘First.’ Pressed if that meant that second would be unacceptable, he smiled and replied: ‘Yeah, same as always.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch the stunning Hoylake course preview . Win or die: Tiger Woods is targeting victory at The Open . On target: He is aiming for his first victory at The Open since 2006 . It is not often that packed media interview rooms are held spellbound by Woods, reflecting his willingness on far too many occasions to fall back on non- committal answers. But here a room containing some 200 people were genuinely held captive. Asked why rust would not be a factor given he has played just two competitive rounds in four months following back surgery, Woods rewound the clock to the 2008 US Open. ‘It was the same back then,’ he said. ‘Between the Masters and the US Open I played nine holes and didn’t break 50 but I still won in a play-off, with a broken leg and a ruptured cruciate. I’ve proven I can do it.’ Woods even allowed a glimpse behind the public mask, and what it meant to return here to the place where he won in 2006, his first major victory following the death of his father Earl that April. ‘I was going through a pretty tough time in my life and so it meant a lot to win,’ he said. ‘I’d pressed pretty hard at the Masters because I knew that would be the last major my dad would see me play. And then I didn’t play well at the US Open and missed the cut there miserably. Then I came here and just felt at peace. When it got to Sunday I was just so calm inside it was surreal.’ Has Woods come back to the sport a changed man? Uncharacteristically, he talked openly about his fears and relief both before and after his surgery. Triple crown: He has lifted the Claret Jug on three previous occasions . Familiar territory: And won his third and most recent title at Hoylake in 2006 . 2006 At Hoylake, Woods won his third Open by two shots. 2007 Tied 12th, five shots off winner Padraig Harrington. 2008 Did not play after knee surgery. 2009 Missed the cut after two bad rounds. 2010 Shot an opening 67 but finished tied for 23rd. 2011 Missed the tournament with injury. 2012 Tied for third, four behind winner Ernie Els. 2013 Tied for sixth, five shots adrift of Phil Mickelson. ‘For a while I couldn’t get out of bed, couldn’t do anything, and it certainly made me appreciate just how fortunate I had been to play the game for the  better part of 17 years at a pretty high level. ‘Previous surgeries, when my knee and leg were trashed, I could still swing the club. I couldn’t do it with this injury. Just the daily things of moving around, I couldn’t actually enjoy my life. ‘If you ask anyone who goes through this surgery, they will tell you it changes your whole life. It takes away all the pain. 'Yes I was sore from the incision but I remember sitting in the recovery room and the overwhelming feeling was one of relief because I knew it was only a matter of time then before I could get strong and play at the elite level again.’ Woods missed the cut comfortably in his comeback event two weeks ago but for the first time in his life after such a result was still smiling. ‘It was such a big moment for me because I’d gone at the ball pretty hard and suffered no  setbacks,’ he said. ‘I could play out of the rough, I could hit full shots and I was able to recover each day. That just wasn’t the case before.’ The 38-year-old is feeling so  good right now he is even talking about playing in the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles. ‘I’ve been on teams with the likes of Phil Mickelson and Jim Furyk for the whole of my professional life and we’ve gone from being rookies to veterans and it has been fantastic,’ he said. ‘Hopefully we will do it again.’ First, The Open. Woods has not won one since that momentous triumph here but it remains a cherished priority. Asked about the different reactions when he is holding the Claret Jug or wearing the Green Jacket, he replied: ‘More people want to drink out of the Jug. With the Jacket, a few wanted to take pictures but everyone wanted to slam back a couple out of the Jug.’ Swing of things: Woods has only recently returned from injury . Putting in the hours: Woods during practice on the 11th green . VIDEO Stunning Hoylake course preview . So to the return to Hoylake. Padraig Harrington might have been overstating it when he said Woods’s  victory here in 2006 was the finest of all his 14 major triumphs but it is clear that it is high up there on the list for Tiger as well, for emotional and professional reasons. ‘It’s just great to be back here and rekindle some of the memories of that fabulous week,’ said Woods. ‘The people were fantastic. They knew what I was going through and were just so supportive. 'It’s been the same this week, and so great to see so many people walking and following us in practice with the crowds getting bigger all the time. ‘Obviously a lot has changed in eight years. The course is different, I’ve got a completely different golf swing and as a  person I’ve been through a lot. From the loss of a parent to having two kids, life is very  different now.’ Asked if he would play into his 50s to catch Jack Nicklaus’s total of 18 majors, Woods was unequivocal: ‘Hopefully I will have it done by then.’ Not that he is underestimating the scale of the challenge of  winning as many majors from now on as Mickelson has won in his entire career in order to overtake Nicklaus. ‘I think it gets harder every year,’ he said. ‘We’ve just had a run where there were 16 or 17 first-time  winners in a row. So the fields are getting deeper and the guys are hitting it further and further. But I am getting stronger as well and I am only going to get stronger and faster, which is great.’ Thirty minutes in the company of Woods can often feel like your life ebbing away. This particular half an hour went by in a flash.","Tiger Woods opens up to reveal he's happy, pain free and focused on more Hoylake heroics .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Twelve months ago he played what he described as ‘brain dead’ golf at The Open at Muirfield and flew out of Scotland in a suitable daze. ‘That was the first time I had missed out on playing at the weekend at an Open. It really did hurt,’ said Rory McIlroy. This time he returns, not only as one of the favourites but with a links game to back up his status. Always assuming he doesn’t suffer one of those freaky Fridays, of course. VIDEO Scroll down for Tiger Woods and Rory Mcilroy prepare for The Open .

Shocker: The Northern Irishman endured a nightmare round this time last year . ‘Ah, the elephant in the room,’ he . said when the delicate question of what the heck happens to him  during . second rounds crops up. So far this year, McIlroy is a combined 51 under . par for first rounds — and a startling nine over for the  following . day. ‘It’s almost at the . point where I am hoping for an average first day so I can go out . thinking I can improve on it,’ said the 25-year-old. ‘Friday . on my mind...’ goes the old song by the Easybeats and McIlroy was . honest enough to admit that’s the problem in his case. ‘I definitely . think it’s got into my head and I have made it a much bigger thing than . it is,’ he said. ‘Maybe I’ve been putting a bit too much pressure on . myself going out on Fridays and trying to back up a good score on day . one. ‘If I have no problem shooting a low one on Thursday then there shouldn’t be any problem doing so the following day. ‘This . week I’ve just got to go out and get a solid start to my second round . under my belt. Hopefully, this is the week when I start to turn this . Friday thing around.’ McIlroy’s . sole victory so far this year also came in England at the European . Tour’s flagship event at Wentworth in May. But for a series of poor . scores on Fridays a good year to this point would surely be seen in a . brighter light already. McIlroy has shot three 63s and one 64 in opening . rounds — and did not go on to win any of those events. Improvement: Rory McIlroy admitted he is concerned by his poor second-round scores .

He is out early in the . first round and late on Friday, and the weather was supposed to turn . horrid on the second afternoon. Now the predictions are more benign. What . happened a year ago will surely act as a spur. In the midst of a . well-publicised slump, McIlroy shot poor rounds of 79 and 75 and came . into the media area looking and sounding like a man who feared he would . never play well again. ‘Chalk and cheese,’ is how he describes now and then. ‘I . feel like I am going into this championship well prepared. I’m playing . well and I got four rounds on a good links course under my belt last . week.’ McIlroy, who had . rounds of 64, 67 and 68 at Royal Aberdeen alongside his Friday blip of . 78, will surely like the fact that Hoylake is unlikely to play like a . typical Open venue.

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Rory McIlroy and Sergio Garcia put a smile back on the face of the game on Friday as the pair turned in a glorious exhibition at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. Open Champion McIlroy shot a fabulous 64 but still couldn’t keep pace with the man he beat at Hoylake, as Spanish renaissance artist Garcia created something of a masterpiece with an amazing course record-equalling 61, including seven birdies in a row to finish. Garcia also birdied the 10th to come home in a remarkable 27 strokes. ‘I have been fortunate enough to have some low rounds in my career but none as low as this,’ said the 34 year old. ‘This was the best one of all.’ Delighted: Sergio Garcia leads the way after a course record-equalling 61 . Indefinite: Johnson will miss the season's final major and Ryder Cup after admitting he needs professional help . In form: Rose is seeking his third win in just four starts after another impressive display . The second round had begun amidst the . murky clamour created by the spectacular downfall of Dustin Johnson, . who announced on Thursday he was taking an indefinite leave of absence . from the game to tackle some ‘personal challenges.’ All . that disappeared to the back of the mind thanks largely to McIlroy and . Garcia but also to two more wonderful ball strikers – Justin Rose and . Rickie Fowler. What a . third round we have in prospect on Saturday, with Rose joining McIlroy . and Garcia in the final threeball after following up his opening 65 with . a 67. Garcia leads by three from Rose with McIlroy four off the pace . and Fowler five behind. McIlroy . was playing in the group behind Garcia and admitted he had gained . motivation watching the latter hole putt after putt. ‘I was playing . really well but thinking to myself if I didn’t make a few birdies I was . going to be too far behind him going into the weekend,’ said the 25 year . old. ‘Fortunately I was able to do that and it was great to finish with . two in a row.’ As for . Rose, he is in prime position to notch his third win in his last four . starts. ‘You scored well but didn’t play well,’ was the verdict of . Rose’s coach Sean Foley after the first round. This time, it was the . other way round as Rose struck the ball so well even a three under par . effort felt scant reward. ‘I guess it all evens itself out in the end,’ he said. Tiger Woods is seven off the pace and just outside the top 20 . after a nondescript 71. In contention: McIlroy lies in joint third after a impressive display so far . Back on track: Woods is slowly but steadily getting his game back on track after back surgery . All of which did much to erase the shock created by Johnson with his stunning announcement on Thursday. On . the practice ground and outside the ropes at Firestone, on websites and . all over social media, they’re certain they know what caused the sad . demise of Johnson. Players . get a three month suspension for a violation of the tour’s anti-doping . policy concerning recreational drug use. With Johnson declaring himself . ineligible even at this stage for the Ryder Cup at the end of September, . people have drawn their own conclusions. There . remains no hard facts, however. The PGA Tour name players guilty of . taking performance-enhancing drugs but not recreational, while Johnson’s . statement simply fuelled the speculation. Whatever . the truth, there will no doubt be many who feel the need to condemn a . man whose party lifestyle appears to have caught up with him. The . prevailing mood here, however, remains an obvious sadness at the fall . of someone who appeared to have everything; someone so gilded that even . fellow members of the elite speak in awed tones about his gifts. No . golfer aged 30 or under has won more times on the PGA Tour than Johnson. ‘When . Dustin is on his game and firing on all cylinders, there really isn’t . an awful lot that most of the rest of us can do to stop him,’ said . Graeme McDowell, following a vain pursuit at the HSBC Champions . tournament in China last November. Zach . Johnson – no relation - couldn’t stop shaking his head in sympathy when . asked about his namesake. ‘It stinks,’ he said, repeatedly. The . other Johnson’s name has been discreetly removed already from the Ryder . Cup qualification list, with brash American Patrick Reed now moving . into the last available slot. He is in good shape to move up still . further following rounds of 67 and 68. Thomas . Bjorn and Jamie Donaldson are both in the top 20 as they seek to cement . their Ryder Cup place but struggling English trio Lee Westwood, Luke .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . In a World of Golf special, Sportsmail's golf correspondent DEREK LAWRENSON picks out what he is looking forward to most when the best players on the planet descend on Hoylake this week for the 2014 Open Championship. 1) THE RETURN OF TIGER. OK, it’s certainly not the Tiger Woods of 2006 vintage and he might only be around for two days. But we’ve seen enough in practice to suggest he might just surprise one or two people. It will certainly add to the event watching him try. He's back: Legendary three-time Open champion Tiger Woods has returned from injury . Star attraction: Crowds gather to watch Woods tee off at the 5th on a practice round . VIDEO Don't give up on Tiger - Watson . 2) ATMOSPHERE. At Muirfield last year the golf was good, the weather even better but the event was as flat as a pancake. With an extra 80,000 spectators expected through the gates and boosting the overall attendance to around 200,000, things should be a lot different this week. 3) GOOD FRIDAY FOR RORY. Yes, it’s all very fascinating watching Rory McIlroy shoot 63 or 64 in first rounds of tournaments and then allow an imposter to take his place the following day. But this is the Open. So can the real Rory please show up for all four days here and not just three? 4) A STOUT DEFENCE FROM PHIL. Mickelson has been watching a video of his fabled final round last year which is just as well given his results sheet over the past 12 months. Let’s hope the good memories rub off on the popular American. There’s not a lot to beat watching Phil when he thrills. Making a point: Experienced American Mickelson won his first Open at Muirfield last year . VIDEO 'New feeling' for defending champion Mickelson . Consistency issues: Rory McIlroy needs to turn up on all four days at Hoylake if he is to win . 5) THE FACTORY MAN. Good to see that the Royal & Ancient have given Hoylake factory worker John Singleton a nice draw alongside American Peter Uihlein and Scot Marc Warren. No unearthly starting time either. The local man tees off in the first round at 10.32am. 6) VIDEO SCOREBOARDS. It’s only right they’ve kept the iconic yellow scoreboard at the 18th but it’s also good they’ve been replaced elsewhere with all-singing, all-dancing scoreboards telling people an awful lot more than simply a player’s hole-by-hole scores. 7) WATCHING TV WHILE WALKING AROUND THE COURSE. How brilliant to be able to follow your favourite player while still catching up with all the action on the BBC. That’s the smartphone promise anyway if you download the Open app, thanks to the internet ‘mesh’ installed. Fingers crossed it works. Local lad: John Singleton has been handed a favourable draw by the R&A . 8) A HOME CHALLENGE. All corners of the UK have men who are fully capable of contending. True, the Open doesn’t depend on one or two of them making a genuine tilt at winning the Claret Jug, but it tends to be a better championship when they do. 9) SPENDING AN HOUR BESIDE THE PAR-THREE 13TH. With the sun out, there’s no better place to watch than clambering up the bank on the right side and viewing the action on this gorgeous short hole beside the Dee estuary, with Hilbre Island shimmering in the distance. 10) THE PACKED GRANDSTAND AT THE 18TH. The massive grandstands have been a feature of every Open but this year organisers have excelled themselves with the first wraparound stand in history around the final hole. Should be spine-tingling come Sunday.","Open Championship begins at Hoylake on Thursday .

If you want to know what it means to have Tiger Woods back and playing at the 143rd Open Championship, then the first tee at Royal Liverpool on Sunday was a pretty good place to start.

Practically everyone else in the field will not have 3,000 people walking around with them next Sunday, never mind this one.

But . off many of the tees it will all start this week like it did back then, . with a two iron ‘stinger’ to take the fairway bunkers out of play. The . first hole was playing into a decent breeze on Sunday, fortifying it . with sufficient length to lure practically everyone into striking some . kind of metal wood. Not Woods. He reached straight for the club he might . well have worn out by the end of the tournament. How . did the swing look, in only Tiger’s second tournament back after four . months out following back surgery? Really good, actually. He was . swinging about three-quarter pace and looked all the better for it. Woods . said he was glad to be back and sounded it. Believe it or not,  he . couldn’t keep a smile off his  face. ‘Taking baby steps over the past . four months has paid off and now I am at that point where I can do what I . want,’ he beamed. Alongside . him was world No 5 Matt Kuchar. The American was candid enough to admit . he thought Tiger ‘crazy’ to make his comeback two weeks ago when he . missed the halfway cut comfortably in his own tournament and was clearly . half-fit. ‘Tiger said he . wanted to test it. Now he’s in the recovery phase  and he said he’s . getting up the next day after playing and feeling good,’ said Kuchar. The . pair had a match going and the personable Kuchar thought it was . advantage to him with Woods 160 yards away in two on the par five 18th. ‘Then he stuffed it in close there, so that was a bit of a bummer, but . more like the Tiger we’re used to seeing,’ he said, smiling. Club selection: Tiger Woods is likely to rely on his two iron once the tournament gets underway . Sand trap: The US golfer is hoping to take bunkers out of play by steering clear of his woods . Going green: Tiger Woods practices his putting as he steps up his recovery from back injury . Packed to the rafters: More crowds gather as Tiger Woods tees off at the 3rd . The pits: Woods' practice partner Matt Kucher insists the US golfer is a contender for The Open . Can . Tiger contend? ‘Absolutely I think he could,’ said Kuchar. ‘The British . Open, the knowledge he has, the skill set he has… yeah,  definitely he . could contend. He was impressive.’ Woods . joked around on a number of occasions with the third member of his . group, big-hitting American Gary Woodland. Not such a big hitter on . this occasion, mind, since the only clubs he was carrying were a sand . wedge and a putter. The other 12? ‘Stuck in some airport,’ he said. ‘The airline lost my clubs and my luggage.’ It happens to them too, then. Woods . arrived on Saturday afternoon and is such a creature of habit that he . teed off within 10 minutes or so of the time he started his preparations . in 2006. hat's entertainment! Whatever the outcome, Toger Woods' return is good for golf . There doesn’t . seem to be any  realistic hope he will end the week with a similar . result but it is surely time the analysts laid off with their negative . carping. A typical wail is: . Why didn’t he get competitive reps in at the Scottish Open last week? When you think most people didn’t believe we would see him again until . late in the year, isn’t it acceptable to ease his way back into the heat . of competition? Hoylake . looks a lot different to the parched beauty we saw in 2006 but this is . down to improved agronomy techniques rather than the weather. In fact, . R&A chief executive Peter Dawson is hopeful it will play almost as . fast-running as it did back then come Thursday, while being green . instead of brown. Good news for Tiger, then, and his stinger.

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Justin Rose has given himself a great chance of making it two wins in a row heading into the Open Championship at Royal Liverpool this week. The popular Englishman posted a wonderful 66 to be tied for  the lead with home hope  Marc Warren going into the final round of the Aberdeen Asset Scottish Open. Rose arrived at Royal Aberdeen full of confidence following a gutsy victory in his last outing in America’s capital at the Quicken Loans National event, where he prevailed on the first hole of a sudden-death play-off. On top: Justin Rose celebrates his birdie on the 16th hole during the third round on Saturday . On the tee: Rose hits off the 17th tee as the Englishman takes a share of the lead into the final day . That has shown over the first three rounds as the 33-year-old closes in on another success. The only worry for Rose if he wins, of course, would be whether it meant he has peaked too early when it comes to the Claret Jug, for how many players win three events in a row? Against that, Rose is such a classy and tough competitor these days he might be one of the few who could handle  the expectation. He showed just how good he has become over the supposedly more difficult back nine, as he mustered no fewer than five birdies to make his statement  of intent. ‘That was as good as I have played all year,’ enthused Rose. ‘I am on a nice little run right now and so the goal now is to keep it going and pull off my first pro win in Scotland.’ Warren however, has every incentive to win himself on what promises to be an intriguing final day as he seeks an afternoon of redemption and make up for the worst day of his professional life in this event two years ago. Back then, Warren led by three shots with just five holes to go, only to lose to Jeev Milkha Singh from India. ‘At the end of the day I can’t change what happened  but I can dream about making amends and winning it this year,’ said the Scot. Rose and Warren will begin one shot ahead of little-known Swede Kristoffer Broberg, who does have four Challenge Tour wins to his name. Rory McIlroy recovered from his latest Friday horror show to shoot 68 and stand seven shots back, with defending champion Phil Mickelson a further shot adrift.

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Rory McIlroy declared himself happy with his preparations for this week’s Open Championship at Hoylake after bouncing back from a familiar Friday failure in the Scottish Open. McIlroy continued a trend of following a superb opening round with a terrible second one, shooting a  seven-over-par 78 at Royal Aberdeen just a day after setting a course record of 64. The 25-year-old responded with a solid 68 on Saturday — with four birdies after dropping a shot at the first — to finish three under par, seven adrift of leaders Justin Rose and Marc Warren. Despondent: McIlroy followed a course record 64 on day one with six bogeys and a double a day later . Turning it round: Despite his horror day two, McIlroy was upbeat during his third round in Aberdeen . Good response: McIlroy hit a third-round 68 at the Scottish Open to cheer his morale ahead of The Open . Upturn in form: McIlroy plays his second shot on the first hole during his third round at Royal Aberdeen . ‘I’ve shot 64 and 68 on this course, which are two really good scores,’ said the former world No 1. ‘Friday was just one of those days when nothing went right. I couldn’t get any momentum. ‘It would be nice to shoot another good one tomorrow, but I feel good with my game and I saw enough positives in there to give me confidence going into The Open. I played solid golf and didn’t put myself in much trouble. I feel much more prepared going into next week. ‘Coming in here I was hitting shots into the wind on the range perfectly, but today I hit a couple that weren’t so good. ‘Hitting . them in practice and hitting them under the gun are two completely . different things and being able to do that over the past three days and . tomorrow as well can only help going into next week. ‘It’s . just about getting rid of these bad stretches of holes or these bad . second rounds or whatever it is. If I can get rid of that, then there’s . no reason why I can’t go there next week and really contend.’ Scotsman . Warren will carry home hopes into the final day as the 33-year-old goes . in search of his first tour win for seven years. But . he will have to erase memories of a horror show at this event two years . ago when he was leading with four holes to go but blew it. Warren . said: ‘I’m in a great position, a very exciting position. For us . Scottish guys it doesn’t get much better than this. It’s our fifth . major. ‘Winning’s never easy but I’ve been in this situation before, so once the gun goes I’ll be ready to do my job.’ Tied at the top: Marc Warren leads the Scottish Open with Justin Rose going into the final round .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Perhaps it is only fitting that the farewell to the greatest links golfer of all time is proving something of a long goodbye. Tom Watson was first waved off at St Andrews in 2010, only for the Royal and Ancient Golf Club to recognise his stunning achievement in coming within a shot of victory in 2009 at the age of 59, and grant him five more years. This interview was arranged to recognise the closing of that window and Watson taking his leave at Royal Liverpool this week. Now the R&A have moved the goalposts once more and it will be back to the Old Course where the final, final hurrah will take place next year. Still going: Watson, pictured in action in May, has pushed his retirement date back another year . And who has any complaints about the great man taking more curtain calls than Sinatra? Let Michael Watson speak for all of us. When his dad phoned him with the news, he settled for a one word answer: ‘Awesome.’ This is a particularly apt moment to converse, of course, since this is when Watson’s worlds collide. Before playing Hoylake for the first time on Saturday, he has been at Gleneagles in his role as America’s Ryder Cup captain, spending time with a few of his prospective team members on a reconnaissance mission before the match in September. And so the conversation zips back and forth, between The Open and the Ryder Cup. My favourite moment . At the opening ceremony at Lytham in 1977, listening to the speeches and watching the American flag go up. I had never played in an international team event before and that was a big moment in my life. My favourite match . Winning the Ryder Cup at The Belfry in 1993 as captain was very satisfying. The Europeans were on a roll, they had a great team, but we just did nearly everything right that week to come out on top. My biggest disappointment . It might be Medinah last time, just watching it on TV. I suffered through that. When I lost The Open in 2009 I had a pit in my stomach for 24 hours. After Medinah, it lasted several days. When we talk about The Open, we get the graciousness that has been the hallmark of his time in the event, right back to his first appearance at Carnoustie in 1975. He has missed only three Opens in the four decades since. And when we talk about the Ryder Cup, we see the hardened inner core of a man strong enough to win it on five occasions (only the Englishman Harry Vardon won it more). Watson thinks Jim Furyk, sixth in the standings, has done enough to finish in the top nine who qualify automatically — the cut-off point is the US PGA Championship next month — and so it was only natural to ask the captain, who has a  psychology degree from Stanford University, whether he will need a quiet word with the player who was one of the fall guys on that dramatic final day at Medinah in 2012. ‘No,’ said Watson. What, no concerns for him at all? ‘No,’ he repeated, in a tone that emphasised this was going to be his one and only word on the subject. Neither were there any revealing answers regarding Ian Poulter, the fist-pumping inspiration for Europe’s record comeback. Do you think, Tom, he will have a target on his back after last time? ‘He’s got a tremendous Cup record, but whoever plays for Europe will have a target on their back given that if we beat them, we gain a point,’ he said. So beating Poulter would not mean anything more — he is just one of a team of 12. Is that what you’re  saying? ‘Those are your words, not mine,’ commented Watson. After the steely eye it was time for rheumy reminiscence. Victory: The USA team pose with the Ryder Cup after beating Europe at the Belfry in 1993 . Leader: Watson holds the Ryder Cup trophy in 1993 after captaining USA to victory . Back to the Claret Jug, then. Did you know the man whom the R&A are desperate to keep at The Open was not allowed anywhere near the first tee on his first day in 1975? ‘I was with John Mahaffey and Hubert Green and Keith McKenzie (then secretary of the R&A)  welcomed us, but he said we weren’t allowed to play Carnoustie. He said it was reserved for qualifiers, that exempt players weren’t allowed to play it. One thing led to another and we ended up at Monifieth.’ Watson had the last laugh. His first visit to The Open, and he ended all such mutterings about him being a choker by winning his first Jug after a play-off against Australian Jack Newton. My favourite moment . I'd . have to choose 1977 at Turnberry and the Duel in the Sun against Jack . Nicklaus. How often do you get to play 36 holes against the greatest . player of all time and come out on top? My favourite round . It . was my first round at Muirfield in 1980. The wind was blowing 30mph, it . was about 50 degrees and raining sideways. And me and Lee Trevino shot . 68. That was great. My biggest disappointment . I . had chances to win several more Opens but I'd have to say 1994 at . Turnberry hurt the most. I was playing so well that week and just . couldn't putt. That one hurt for quite a while. So it began, the Watson era, and while there were glorious victories at Muirfield (1980), Troon (1982) and Birkdale (1983) it would be his time at Turnberry that would prove definitive. ‘Three of the most memorable highlights were at Turnberry. One was a victory and two were disappointments,’ he said. ‘Duelling down the stretch with Jack Nicklaus in 1977 would have to be my finest moment but 1994 was the most  disappointed I’ve ever felt leaving a golf course. ‘Some might talk about losing to Seve at St Andrews in 1984 and yes, it would have been wonderful to win The Open at the Home of Golf. But in 1994 I was playing so well and yet I couldn’t do a thing with the putter. I put it round the hole for four days but I couldn’t make it count. ‘Then in 2009, that was such a marvellous experience up until the final moments. I had a pit in my stomach for a day afterwards but the disappointment was buffered  by the fact it was a bonus to be in  contention at that stage of my life, and the fact I had won five Opens. ‘But do you know the one thing that never grows old? It’s that lovely feeling of anxiety and nervousness on the first tee. I still get it now.’ Talking to Watson about The Open recalls that wonderful Bobby Jones line: ‘I could take out of my life  everything except my experiences at St Andrews, and I would still have had a rich, full life.’ Does he feel the same way? ‘Bob put it beautifully and eloquently, didn’t he?’ said Watson. ‘Yes I do. That’s why it means so much to me to be able to finish at St Andrews. ‘When you think of the great courses of the world you think of two in particular — Pebble Beach and St Andrews. I was lucky enough to finish at the US Open at Pebble Beach with my son on the bag and did all right (he finished in the top 30 in 2010). Now we get the chance to do the same at St Andrews.’ Duel in the Sun: Watson shakes hands with Nicklaus after winning The Open at Turnberry in 1977 . And so the long goodbye continues at Royal Liverpool, where Watson will have one eye on his own play and one on those who can make his team. There are basically only three more chances for Americans to force their way into the US side through automatic qualifying and this week is one of them. ‘What am I looking for during these last few events? Someone to reach out and demand a place with their play,’ said Watson. ‘It’s like in football, you get to the last seconds and there’s a player who says:  “Give me the ball, coach. I’ll get you the score you need.” I want players who can make that putt and win a tournament.’ What about the man he has spent most of his time answering  questions about — Tiger Woods? ‘First, it’s great to see him back and I assume he’s healthy if he’s playing at Hoylake,’ he said. ‘I’ve said all along I’ll pick him if he’s healthy and playing well. Back on the prowl: Tiger Woods will play at Hoylake after returning from injury . ‘My only concern is the FedEx Cup play-offs. If he doesn’t make those, that would mean he’s missing a month of competitive golf before the Ryder Cup — having missed such a big chunk already. If that happened, I’d have a decision to make.’ As for his own game, do not be surprised if Watson makes it through to the weekend. He did it at a PGA Tour event two weeks ago where, remarkably at the age of 64, he broke 70 in three of his four rounds. The swing might not be quite as full and the putting stroke remains shaky, as it has for the past 20 years. But he can still play. Regardless, of course, the spectators in the first wraparound stand in Open history at Hoylake’s 18th hole will rise to recognise his contribution to the game’s showpiece. It is, quite simply, beyond compare.","Veteran golfer's final, final goodbye will take place at St Andrews next year .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . One of the . joys of this golfing season has been the Thursday masterclass from Rory . McIlroy and the one delivered at Royal Aberdeen in the opening round of . the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open was surely the best yet. This . one, delivered over one of Britain’s finest links courses, was so good . it surely laid to rest any idea he still possesses shortcomings when it . comes to this venerable form of the game. And . so alongside the 63s delivered at the Emirates course in Dubai and PGA . National in Florida in February, and Muirfield Village in Ohio in May, . comes a new course record 64 and a consummate demonstration of all he . has learned since he vented his frustration over links golf after being . blown away at Royal St George’s in 2011. Reward: Rory McIlroy poses with the European Tour Golfer of the Month award for May in Aberdeen . Now watch this drive: McIlroy hits off the tee during day one of the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open . What a view: McIlroy, Jamie Donaldson and Thongchai Jaidee approach the 17th green during the first round . ‘It’s obviously not my natural style of golf but I am determined to make it my favourite for two weeks every year,’ was the wry verdict of the 25 year old. The highlight was undoubtedly the wind-assisted drive at the par four 13th, struck so hard and true it trickled on to the green fully 436 yards away. Ian Poulter was putting at the time.  ‘I only hit a three wood as well,’ said McIlroy to Poults jokingly, after the sheepish apology. Yet it was the shots played into the wind that were really the most impressive. We all know how far Rory can hit it when he opens his shoulders. But here as well were the cut-down shots that you need to win Scottish Open and Open titles. A gorgeous four iron at the par three seventh, for example, that only flew 160 yards – fully 70 yards less than McIlroy normally carries the ball through the air with that club. At the fifth he hit an eight iron that only travelled 120 yards, as against the more normal 170 yards. It might not be his favoured form of golf but McIlroy is so good he still has a prized collection of low scores on links courses. A scarcely-credible 61 at Royal Portrush, for example, and a 63 at St Andrews. ‘Given how hard the front nine was playing, I’d definitely rate it right up there,’ said McIlroy. ‘I can’t remember shooting this low before on a links when the wind was this strong.’ Still, nobody will be thinking of handing him the trophy just yet. The other thing that binds those masterclasses together is they have invariably been followed by Friday horror shows, most notably with a 78 at Muirfield Village. That one was so bad it drew a raised eyebrow from tournament host Jack Nicklaus. When the pair met for lunch a week later, it was still on the great man’s mind. ‘How do you go from a 63 to a 78?’ the Golden Bear good-naturedly enquired. Personal best: The Northern Irishman ranks the round as one of the best he's played on a links course . VIDEO Fun to learn new course - McIlroy . In fact, it was part of a curious run on Fridays that saw McIlroy shoot 40 or more for nine holes for four straight events on the PGA tour and five out of six tournaments. ‘I think it’s more mental than anything, just focusing too much on where I am on the leaderboard rather than going out and trying to play another solid round of golf,’ said McIlroy. ‘So that’s what I will be trying to do here in the second round.’ McIIroy, who leads by a shot from Swedish early bird Kristoffer Broberg – he was first man out at 6-30am – wasn’t the only big name to show up on the leaderboard. Not going so well? Ian Poulter puts his head in his hands during the first round in Aberdeen . Luke-ing good: Englishman Donald drives off the fourth tee on his way to an opening round of 67 . Defending champion Phil Mickelson . might have three-putted the 18th but a 68 still represented a solid . start to his big fortnight, while his playing partner Luke Donald edged . him with a 67. Mickelson was . typically good value, with an eagle three at the sixth and then an . outrageous birdie at the 13th, after his drive finished on a paved path. A free drop was on offer but doing that would be boring, wouldn’t it? So Phil played a sand wedge approach off the path to 8ft and rolled in . the birdie putt. The . American’s woes this year have been mainly to do with poor putting, and . he was encouraged with his work in that department. ‘I was pleased with . the way I putted,’ he said. ‘Even though I three putted the last, it was . much better. It was a good round.’ Rough spot: Ricardo Gonzalez finds himself in trouble on the 13th as his ball ends up in the long grass . Reigning champion: Phil Mickelson tees off at the third hole as he looks to retain his title . This event is the start of a busy run . for the stars, with most playing eight out of the next ten events before . a week off and then the Ryder Cup. ‘What I’m looking for from these . events is to build up some momentum,’ said Donald. ‘It’s . been what I would call a choppy season to this point, with some good . weeks but some poor ones. I need to shoot some low scores, so I can . build up a head of steam.’ A . four under par bogey-free round certainly represented a start in the . right direction for the runaway winner of this event in 2011. The . players out in the morning had the best of the conditions, as the . greens dried out and the wind changed direction. Justin Rose shot a fine . 69 but Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood both laboured, as they carded . scores of 73 and 72 respectively. American Rickie Fowler shot 71 while . Sir Nick Faldo, making a rare tournament appearance a week shy of his . 57th birthday, shot a creditable 73.

"By . Derek Lawrenson . A five-day trip with six mates to Ibiza, followed by a night out with a glamorous model in Dublin. Is Rory McIlroy turning into one of those 24-hour party people? Such is the uncommon fascination with the Northern Irishman’s social life, perhaps we better start by dealing with what he’s been up to since he played in the Irish Open two weeks ago. VIDEO Scroll down to watch a fan sent flying into a cactus as McIlroy skews a shot . In the public eye: McIlroy's Ibiza holiday and his night out with model Nadia Forde have hit the headlines . After all, a week in Ibiza with the boys conjures up all sorts of images, doesn’t it? ‘We did a few of the things lads do when they go to Ibiza, but it wasn’t one of those lads’ holidays,’ he said, laughing. ‘We had a nice boat and we stayed on that and went out to sea every day, so it wasn’t your typical lads trip.’ And the night out in the fair city when he got home, sparking the usual frenzy in the gossip columns and beyond? ‘I’m clearly not playing well enough if people don’t want to talk about my golf,’ he said, without a trace of rancour. ‘Let’s just say I’m very single and very happy at the minute.’ Speaking freely: McIlroy was open during a press conference ahead of the Scottish Open . Signing autographs: McIlroy in action during the Pro Am prior to the start of the Scottish Open . VIDEO Fun to learn new course - McIlroy . There’s more than one way to experience ecstasy, of course, and McIlroy is hoping to follow in Novak Djokovic’s footsteps and find it after leaving Ibiza. ‘I know Novak spent some time there after the French Open, so let’s see if I can follow his example at Wimbledon and win The Open,’ he said. Before all that, there is McIlroy’s decision to follow Phil Mickelson’s example and end his five-year exile from the AAM Scottish Open at Royal Aberdeen today. ‘I played with Phil for the first two rounds at the Open at Muirfield last year and you could see he was ready to play, that his game was really sharp,’ said the 25-year-old, about the American who opened so many eyes with his Scottish Open and Open double last year. 'You could tell he had played competitive golf the week before and even then I was thinking I might play the Scottish next year. There’s a few of us that Phil really influenced in that regard.’ Green fingers: McIlroy takes a putt during the Pro-Am in Aberdeen on Wednesday . There might be a few who will wish they hadn’t been swayed come Sunday, for this glorious links is far removed from the rather benign test presented by Castle Stuart last year. In 1996 the Scottish Open was staged at a similar beast in Carnoustie and Colin Montgomerie was among those who raged as he walked off the 72nd green, claiming his swing had been ‘destroyed’ and his chances at the Open in tatters. ‘There’s certainly a case for saying this will be a harder test than next week’s,’ said McIlroy, who played at Hoylake at the weekend. ‘I think we all know this is going to be quite a challenge, and particularly with the weather forecast of wind and rain for a couple of days. 'But I am trying to adopt the mindset of relishing that challenge. If the conditions get really bad then yes, it is going to be a tough week and a long slog. 'But I don’t see how it should affect anyone’s chances next week. You can take Monday off and then get back at it, so I don’t have any concerns on that front.’ In the spotlight: McIlroy has been in the tabloids for his trip to Ibiza and night out with an Irish model . High-profile split: The former world No 1 ended his relationship with Caroline Wozniacki earlier this year . Three years ago, McIlroy had so many concerns about links golf he had a little moan after playing in the wind at Royal St George’s. A top ten finish in the Irish Open in frightful conditions at Royal Portrush the following year was the start of a change of heart. ‘I played pretty well but what was more pleasing was the fact I was playing the shots that you need to play on a links, which was more important than my scores,’ he said. McIlroy was asked the inevitable question about Tiger Woods’s return next week and admitted his surprise he was playing in the Open so soon after his return from back surgery. Glory days: Tiger Woods won The Open the last time it was held at Hoylake in 2006 . ‘I don’t think I would want to start back at a major under that amount of pressure but he’s done it for so many years and knows how to deal with it well,’ said McIlroy. ‘He’s missed a chunk of the season and I am sure he wants to get into the FedEx Cup play-off events in August at least and maybe push for a Ryder Cup place. 'So I wouldn’t write him off completely next week. I still think he can do things that we don’t see from any other golfer, so we will see what happens.’ Must do better: McIlroy, pictured at Curragh racecourse, is hoping to find his form at the Scottish Open . As he walked off the 18th green following his pro-am round yesterday, McIlroy went straight to a television interview. Sam Torrance was nearby. ‘It’s behind you!’ said Sam. When McIlroy duly turned round, he saw the sparkling Claret Jug. McIlroy’s answer, however, would surely gladden the heart of the sponsors. ‘I said to him: “I will focus on that next week,”’ said McIlroy. ‘You know, we shouldn’t forget this is one of the big titles in Europe. 'Believe me, if I’m in contention come Sunday afternoon, I won’t be thinking about anything else but trying to win the Scottish Open. 'When I won the PGA at Wentworth in May it might not have been quite in front of a home crowd but it was in front of fans who were really supportive. And I think it would be the same here.’ VIDEO US Stars prepare for Open challenge .","McIlroy has been in the public eye in recent days after spending time in Ibiza with pals .

But there's a lot more to Hull's game than that, beginning with a . ferocious work ethic that frequently sees her dropped off by her dad at . Woburn first thing in the morning and picked up late at night. Presumably he will be glad when she can take herself, although it . doesn't appear her skills in that particular driving department will be . catching up to those on the driving range any time soon. 'It wasn't a . good start to get told off on my first lesson!' she giggled. 'I was . looking at the dials and thinking, ""That's OK, I'm going about 30mph"", . but it turned out I was looking at the rev counter. In reality I was . doing about 60!' As for the golf, she's moved effortlessly into the . fast lane. The current leader of the European Ladies Order of Merit, . she's ranked in the world's top 35 already and revelled in a duel with . Michelle Wie and Jessica Korda in a recent LPGA tournament. She didn't . win, but was appreciative of Korda's comments afterwards. Picture this: Michelle Wie practices her putting on the 18th in front of (left to right) Laura Davies, Paula Creamer, Lydia Ko, Charley Hull and Rikako Morita . 'She said . to me she hoped I got my card to play in America because I fully . deserved it,' said Hull. 'It was lovely to hear. I thought I showed I . could play among the best at the Kraft Nabisco in April (the first . women's major of each season) but Jess's comments told me I had been . accepted, and were a huge boost to my confidence. 'I'm just living my . dream right now. I never wanted to go to college in America because to . me that was taking me away from my perfect job for four years.' That's . the approach she will adopt as the leading home hope when the Ricoh . Women's British Open gets under way at Royal Birkdale. Sometimes . when she's in the rough, Hull will wonder what her hero, Seve . Ballesteros, would do. The Spaniard announced himself to the world at .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . On his first return to these shores since his amazing double of Scottish Open and Open Championship titles last July, Phil Mickelson would be fully entitled to look in his rear-view mirror with a  self-indulgent smile. There, this veritable golfing pied piper would see not only  Rory McIlroy but Justin Rose, Ian  Poulter and Lee Westwood. From his own country he would spot Rickie Fowler plus 2014 PGA Tour winners Matt Every and Kevin Streelman. There’s Jimmy Walker, No 2 in the standings for America’s Ryder Cup team. What’s going on? When you think of the sparse quality on view at last year’s Scottish Open, when none of these illustrious names showed up, it’s positively miraculous that so many would compete in this year’s edition, which starts at Royal Aberdeen on Wednesday — and it’s all down to Big Phil. Scroll down for video . Claret jug: Phil Mickelson claims he became a 'complete player' after winning The Open in 2013 . The double: Phil Mickelson won both the Scottish Open and main event last year . ‘What he . achieved last year  certainly got my attention and looking at my own . Open record, I thought: ""Why not try what Phil did?"",’ said Rose. ‘Phil . set the standard and put ideas in all of our heads,’ agreed Fowler. Dressed in navy shorts and a crisp white shirt, the man in question bounces into a room set aside at a recent PGA Tour event to talk links golf, and particularly  his own evolution from out-of-his-depth malcontent to arch-exponent of this venerable form of the game. But first, his outstanding role in the transformation of the Scottish Open from the worst field in its  history to the best. That must give him enormous pleasure? ‘It always seemed a common sense thing to me to come over a few days early and get acclimatised, and particularly if you live in the States,’ said Mickelson, who first played in the Scottish Open in 1992 and has only missed two editions since 2003. ‘It made even more sense when they moved it from Loch Lomond to links courses. My short game was so sharp during the Open at  Muirfield last year and a lot of that was due to the fact we had spent a week playing at Castle Stuart. ‘It gave me a lot of time to work on the different shots you need in firm conditions.’ VIDEO US Stars prepare for Open challenge . Trail blazer: The Open champion's decision to play is Scotland last year has been followed by others . Young pretenders: Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose will be honing their skills at the Scottish Open . Mickelson’s first experiences of links golf were actually quite encouraging. In 1991 he made the cut as an amateur on his Open debut at Birkdale before scoring three points out of four for America at the Walker Cup at Portmarnock. ‘That year I had Johnny Miller’s old caddie, Ted Halsall, on the bag at Birkdale and he said to me there was no doubt I would win an Open Championship one day,’ recalled Mickelson. ‘But as the years passed, I wasn’t so sure he was right. It was a  much longer process than I ever  imagined to get my game to accommodate links golf and there were times when I wondered whether I would ever manage it. ‘Because I had been brought up to fly the ball through the air I just got more upset with the crazy bounces and the cross winds. Crazy bounces and crosswinds: Phil Mickelson sometimes wondered if he would ever be able to master links golf . THE GOODThe winner of the Scottish Open had never gone on to win the Open, but last year Mickelson did the double. He claimed his first European Tour event after a play-off at Castle Stuart and won by three strokes at Muirfield. THE BADMickelson started the last round of the 2011 Open on level par. He charged to six under at Royal St. George’s and shared the lead but finished second after four bogeys in six holes on the back nine.THE UGLYA month after coming second at the US Open in 1999, Mickelson was world No 10 and hotly tipped to do well at the Open. But rounds of 79 and 76 at Carnoustie meant he missed the cut. Andrew Magee . ‘Once I realised the idea was to get the ball on the ground and let it affect the ball more than the  air and the wind it became more  manageable. But there’s no  question it took me quite a while to really appreciate the greatness of the challenge.’ A breakthrough of sorts came at Royal Troon in 2004, when he started working with short-game guru Dave Pelz. ‘That was a real turning point for me, where we worked on shots to keep the ball down, and I ended up finishing third there, and missing out on the play-off by one shot,’ he said. Nevertheless, it would be another seven years before he would get in contention again. In the wind and rain at Royal St George’s, Mickelson put together a front-nine charge in the final round, before running out of steam as the trophy went to Darren Clarke. So to last year, and Castle Stuart. After Mickelson finished runner-up for the sixth time at the US Open the previous month we had a final day on the coast where he wouldn’t have had a prayer at one time, as the gusts reached 30mph. Breakthrough: Phil Mickelson finally got to grips with The Open after coming third at Royal Troon in 2004 . Mickelson made it exciting by taking four on the last hole when a three would have won him his first title in Europe. But an exquisite chip decided the subsequent play-off against South African Branden Grace. ‘No-one likes a predictable movie now, do they?’ he told an adoring Scottish audience. A win the week before a major is usually a kiss of death for a player’s chances at the big one, but Mickelson is no ordinary golfer. He once won the week before the Masters and then the green jacket itself, so had no fears he had peaked too early. Just the opposite, in fact. The Scottish Open trophy was all the evidence he needed he could play links golf at the highest level. ‘The win gave me so much momentum heading into the Open,’ recalled the 44-year-old. ‘I felt like I had all the tools at my disposal to do well at Muirfield. I had shown to myself I could play links golf in a decent wind and score well. That win gave me an awful lot of satisfaction.’ Comeback: Phil Mickelson came from behind to beat Lee Westwood to the title at Muirfield last season . Sealed with a kiss: The US golfer celebrates realising his Open dream with his family in East Lothian . Not as much, however, as the one a week later. Trailing Westwood by five, Mickelson not only caught him but beat him by four strokes with a final round that sits alongside the finest in the tournament’s long and illustrious history. No wonder he looks back on that fortnight as among the most satisfying of his career, and the Claret Jug has been with him everywhere on his travels. Back home in  California when friends come over for dinner he takes it out of the trophy cabinet and allows his companions to enjoy a tipple. ‘The coolest trophy in golf,’ he says. As he prepares to leave the room, he has one final thing to say about that special July in Scotland and how proud he feels to be Open champion. ‘Do you know why winning the Claret Jug was so meaningful to me?’ he says. ‘It validated to me that I have become a complete player. I accomplished the goal of learning a form of golf that was completely different to the one I grew up playing.’","Phil Mickelson returns to defend The Open title he won in 2013 .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . They are the new big three of American golf — and no, they don’t go by names like Tiger, Phil or Rickie. Meet Michelle, Stacy and Lexi, the trio who have breathed fresh life into the struggling women’s game. At a time when the men’s variety is crying out for an old-fashioned rivalry, these three are regularly battling each other down the stretch. Each presently holds a major. Now they are bringing their compelling act to these shores, where they will start as three of the favourites for the Ricoh British Open at Royal Birkdale this week. Star: Michelle Wie is an icon in women's golf and her rivalry with Lewis and Thompson is good for the game . Not just a pretty face: Wie shows off her US Open trophy in New York but she has earned her glory . Of course, it does not hurt that they are photogenic. Dressed in a dazzling aqua blue dress for a whirlwind day of publicity after winning the US Open last month, Michelle Wie showed she could hold her own in the fashion and beauty stakes alongside anyone on the tennis circuit. What is great for women’s golf, though, is that there is much more to them than the fact they look good. This trio can really play and each has an intriguing story to tell of their rise to the top. Lexi Thompson was playing in the US Open at the age of just 12. Now, still only 19, she has become the fully fledged article, with a major already to her name after winning the Kraft Nabisco Championship impressively in California in April. Wie, of course, was the one who was always tipped for the top. At 14 she missed the cut in a men’s PGA Tour event in her native Hawaii by a single stroke, coming in with a better 36-hole score off the same tees than players as good as Adam Scott. Young star: Lexi Thompson is still only 19 but made her US Open debut seven years ago . Thereafter, her struggles have been well-chronicled but she never gave in. Now, a decade later and with a degree from Stanford University also to her name, she is fulfilling all her promise. The one they are both trying catch, however, is current world No1 and this week’s defending champion, Stacy Lewis. At 29, what a triumph for guts and determination her rise to the top represents. Consider that for all her high school years Lewis had to wear a brace for 18 hours each day to correct a curvature of the spine. She sat out playing golf during her first year at college because she was recovering from surgery, yet still went on to become one of the most decorated players in the amateur game. No wonder her website is: stacysback.com. Right now she is playing the best golf of her life and holds a Tiger-like lead at the top of the rankings. On top: World number one stacy Lewis stormed back to beat Wie in Arkansas last week . She has won three of her past seven events and showed her mental strength last Sunday. The task was to catch Wie in the final round, after she had beaten her into second place in the US Open the previous week. In front of an adoring crowd in Arkansas, where she went to college, she pulled it off. So after the first major of the season was won by Thompson over Wie and the second by Wie over Lewis, it would be no surprise if the trend continued at Birkdale, particularly if the event is blessed with sunshine. Let’s not forget either the two precocious teenagers: Lydia Ko from New Zealand, just 17 and already the world No2; and our own Charley Hull, only 18 and yet a star of the last Solheim Cup. The first of two successive Opens on England’s gilded North West coast promises to be every bit as fascinating as the men’s version at Royal Liverpool next week.","Three stars provide a rivalry missing in the men's game .

Doctors believed it would be at least six months before Filipe Luis kicked a ball again following his horror leg break in January 2010. It was one of those sickening moments, his right foot dangled limply as he held his leg by the calf. Chelsea's latest recruit, in a match against Athletic Bilbao while at Deportivo, had made a penetrating run down the left flank, passed the ball and continued into the box. Blues brother: Felipe Luis is on the verge of completing a £20million move from Atletico Madrid to Chelsea . Horror: Doctors thought the defender would be out for six months after breaking his leg against Athletic Bilbao . VIDEO Chelsea agree fee for Filipe Luis . When it was headed back across goal Luis leapt to divert the ball under the goalkeeper and into the net, but Bilbao's Gorka Iraizoz landed heavily on top of him and the leg snapped. His team-mates stood with heads in hands. Deportivo manager Miguel Ángel Lotina held his eyes closed in anguish. The left-back had played every single minute of the campaign up until that moment. He shouldn't have played another. Remarkably, he was back before four months had passed. When Henrik Larsson broke his leg playing for Celtic against Lyon in October 1999, under a similarly innocuous challenge from Serge Blanc, it took him nine months to recover. Former Arsenal forward Eduardo was out for a week shy of one year following his nightmare leg break from Martin Taylor's challenge in February 2008. It is the sort of injury than can shatter not just a players' bones but their confidence, but Luis has continued to grow as a full-back since. Agony: Former Celtic striker Henrik Larsson took nine months to recover from a similar injury in 1999 . Ouchy! Ex Arsenal forward Eduardo suffered an horrific leg break against Birmingham in 2008 . As a youngster he was highly-rated but failed to get a break. He was playing in the first-team of Brazilian side Figueirense aged 18 and the following season went on loan to Ajax. He could not make it out of the reserve team and they decided not to make their interest permanent. Luis moved to Uruguayan side Rentistas but Real Madrid immediately took him on loan. Again, he was stuck in their B team and they did not take up an option to buy him. Then Deportivo came in for the player and it was there he began to make his name as one of the best full-backs in La Liga. Whereas the likes of Dani Alves, at Barcelona, and Marcelo, at Real Madrid, are praised for their ability to maraud forward but are considered suspect at the back, Luis is different. He is equally adept at defending as he is going forward. Standing 6ft he is tall for a full-back and strong in the air as well as with the ball at his feet. Cream: The Brazilian full-back made a name for himself as One of La Liga's best left-backs at Deportivo la Coruna . Forward thinking: Barcelona's Dani Alves (L) and Marcelo of Real Madrid can ignore defensive responsibilities . The summer after his leg break, following four years at Deportivo, he signed for Atletico Madrid in an £11.3million deal. Still he continued to blossom. Last season he was part of an Atletico Madrid back line which conceded just 26 goals in 38 league games, beat off the financial clout of Barcelona and Real Madrid to win the Spanish title and came within 90 seconds of winning the Champions League. In that campaign he made two assists, had an 80 per cent passing accuracy and won 107 tackles. Luis, 28, has not always gone down the conventional route. He turned down the opportunity to move to Barcelona to increase his own chances of progression. 'If I had gone to Barcelona, I would have won a couple of Champions League titles, but I wouldn’t be as happy as I am here at Atlético,' Luis said. At Atletico he developed a strong relationship with manager Diego Simeone, claiming that 'I think he's changing our lives' and 'each year that goes by, I’ ve improved working with him.' That appears soured after Simeone forced him to train with the reserves ahead of his move to Stamford Bridge.

"By . Sam Cunningham . Follow @@samcunningham . He is known as Mr Clean, has been compared to France legend Laurent Blanc and Jose Mourinho believes he is the best young defender on the planet. Rio Ferdinand also suggests he is the man who should replace him at Manchester United. Real Madrid centre-back Raphael Varane, 21, has the world at his feet and, still in Brazil with France, has the World Cup in his sights. Chelsea manager Mourinho adores him. The Portuguese left no stone unturned to make sure he became a Real Madrid player when he was in charge at the Spanish club. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Varane falling victim to Ronaldo's skill in Real Madrid training . World at his feet: Raphael Varane is one of the best young defenders in the world . Battler: Varane challenges for the ball with Emmanuel Emenike during their  last-16 World cup game against Nigeria . Varane was a Lens academy player from age nine, having already spent two years at France’s prestigious Football Training Centre in Liévin, and by the time he was 17 captained the first team. But Mourinho was already in pursuit. Who better to convince a French teenager to join your club than Zinedine Zidane? Mourinho set the retired midfield genius, an advisor to Madrid president Florentino Perez, on the scent and the pair met on numerous occasions. ‘I played an active role in the transfer,’ Zidane said. ‘He is a quality player and has an incredible future ahead of him.’ Varane was flown over to Spain and invited to visit Madrid’s facilities. Mourinho also met with the player, to further enforce their desire to bring him to the club. ‘The fact that he saw Jose Mourinho was very important,’ Zidane added. ‘This is the most important part because he is the coach who will lead the team. They met and essentially that’s it. ‘He is a very promising player and was an obvious target for a club such as Real Madrid seeking talent. ‘Varane has a great future. The fact many top clubs wanted him is an indication he has talent. ‘He is a player I like very much and in many ways resembles Laurent Blanc. I haven’t seen many players like that. I have watched plenty of Varane and he is like Blanc; fast, intelligent and he is a big player.’ Honour: He has been compared in many ways with French defensive legend Laurent Blanc . Duo: Jose Mourinho and Zinedine Zidane worked hard to bring the youngster to the club . So highly-rated is Varane that, in April 2013, he was voted by a Marca fan poll into Real Madrid's best ever foreign XI - alongside the likes of Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo and Roberto Carlos - at the age of 19. Zidane would know, he lifted the World Cup alongside his countryman in 1998. After Varane’s first full season in Lens’ senior squad, where he made 23 appearances but could not stop them getting relegated from Ligue 1, Mourinho finally pounced. In June 2011, Varane, still only 18, passed a medical at the Sanitas Hospital La Moral and signed a six-year deal, moving for a fee understood to be in the region of £8million. The French club were disappointed to lose their star youngster but President Gervais Martel admitted they could not stand in the way of such a move. Varane and Mourinho hit it off straight away. In his first season they won the La Liga title together. He scored his first goal against Rayo Vallecano in only his second game; an audacious, sublime back-heel volley from a Mesut Ozil corner making him the youngest foreign player, at 18 years and 152 days, to score a goal in a competitive match for Real. The following season, when he scored in the Copa del Rey semi-final against Barcelona he ran to the touchline and leapt into Mourinho’s arms. Embrace: Varane and Mourinho had an incredibly close relationship at Real Madrid . Tangle: Varane gets involved in a Champions League Final scuffle between Diego Simeone and Marcelo . Their bond transcends the boundaries of football. ‘Jose Mourinho is like a second father to me,’ Varane said while Mourinho was still at Madrid. ‘In football terms, he has significant input. He shows his support and his faith in me. He finds the right words to give you the peace of mind to be able to improve, which is important. We often talk. He’s really close to his players.’ Last season, under Carlo Ancelloti, Varane added the Champions League and Copa del Rey to his trophy cabinet. His height and leap make him formidable in the air, but he is known for his composure on the ball and his adept reading of the game, similar to Ferdinand in his pomp. It is that approach to football – rather than an aggressive, tough tackler – where his alternative title is derived. ‘I really like my nickname: Mr Clean,’ Varane added. ‘That’s my style.’ VIDEO Varane reveals Deschamps secret .","Varane is best young defender on the planet, according to Jose Mourinho .

The teams meet on June 19 in their second match of the tournament in what could be a make-or-break game for Roy Hodgson’s side. But Sunderland boss and former Uruguayan international Poyet says the South Americans will do anything to beat England - even repeating the Luis Suarez handball that knocked Ghana out of the 2010 World Cup quarter-final. Cheat to victory? Gus Poyet claims Uruguay will do anything to beat England at the World Cup . Handball referee! Uruguay frontman Luis Suarez was sent off for stopping a Ghana effort on goal with his hands during the quarter-finals of the 2010 World Cup . According to Poyet this unscrupulous streak – drummed into them from birth – is inherent in the national culture. Just ask Ghana – that’s how they went out of the last World Cup in 2010. Their quarter-final in South Africa was tied at 1-1 and into extra time but Dominic Adiyah’s header in the dying minutes beat Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera and was going in. Until Luis Suarez flung his hand at the ball and pushed it out. It was an instinctive reflex, bred through generations. The Liverpool striker was sent off, but then Asamoah Gyan missed the resulting penalty and Uruguay went through in the shootout. Poyet, who won 26 caps for Uruguay said: ‘What I’m going to say is something very, very normal for me and I hope you take it well,’ he says. 'I know that for you a handball on the goal line is cheating. But not for us. It’s part of the game. ‘Like if I’m the last man and you’re running and I pull your shirt and you go down and I get sent off – is that cheating? No it’s not cheating. ‘You guys take it as a last man red card, fine. We take the same reaction [for what Suarez did]. ‘I know it was massive in England, I know. But England’s reaction came as a surprise for us. ‘We thought, “Why?” Suarez had saved it. He was sent off. It was a penalty. It’s true. It’s worse for us when you do something that no-one sees, like punching someone. But a handball on the goal-line is a handball on the goal-line.’ Onto the next round: Suarez and his Uruguay team-mates celebrate despite the striker's sending off . Should Suarez have told the referee, “It’s a handball so send me off?” Poyet dismisses the idea as unthinkable. ‘No we don’t do that,’ he adds. ‘We try to hide, but everyone saw it.’ It can all be explained by ‘garra charrua,’ which runs through the very heart and soul of Uruguay. In the literal translation ‘garra’ means ‘claw’ and ‘charrua’ is the term for native Indians in the country. The most natural translation is a fighting spirit. All South American nations say they have ‘garra,’ but in Uruguay they consider ‘garra charrua’ as their national trademark. Poyet adds: ‘We won’t accept that you are better than us, I won’t accept that you are better than me. ‘If you appear better than me, I will find a way, with my players around, to stop you. ‘If I accept you’re better than me, then I lose. So I won’t accept it. How can I? ‘We tell each other when we’re playing: are you helping me here? Are you covering me? Are you stopping them playing? ‘We’re . sticking the opposition a little bit, grabbing them, being stronger . than them. Whatever it is, to stop you, to win the game. Yeah we do . that, and we are proud of that. International: Poyet, pictured challenging England's Andrew Cole, won 26 caps for his country . ‘I think that’s a way you win more than you lose. If you just go to the game and you play the game and if you are worse you lose – that means you didn’t want to win as much as I did. ‘Do you want to win the game of football more than me? You’ve got no chance. Because I will do more than you to win.’ Poyet played with Paolo Montero for the national side in the 1990s, perhaps the epitome of that ‘win-at-all-costs’ concept. The defender was ruthless on the field. A horror for opposition players to face. Poyet considers that they took ‘garra charrua’ too far back then, incessantly urged to batter opponents. ‘I hated it when I was playing with the national team and when we were playing they were expecting a horrible team, kicking everyone,’ he recalls. ‘But it was a pleasure to have Montero in my team. Just as long as he wasn’t against me.’ It is instilled in children as young as six in Uruguay, this insatiable lust for victory overpowering any sense of morality or justice. Football is a way of life over there and they care little for other sports. Tough guy: Paolo Montero was ruthless on the field and Poyet says it was a pleasure to play alongside him . The clash of cultures is stark. In England youngsters are taught to play for fun. In Uruguay youngsters are ordered to win. ‘You know the discussion going on all over the world that you cannot make kids of seven or eight play to win because they need to enjoy the game? In Uruguay you need to win at six,’ Poyet says bluntly, not that he necessarily agrees with this. ‘It is a way of living and learning,’ he insists, speaking at the launch of ITV’s coverage of the World Cup in Brazil this summer. ‘Players have to win games at a very early age. ‘I tried to change that. I went to Uruguay for two years and was the chairman of a big organisation of children from five to 13 and I tried to convince them to slow down and not be so crazy about winning. It did nothing. It is not in our culture.’ Are England too nice? There is not a moment’s hesitation to Poyet’s reply: ‘Yes. No doubt.’ Is the Uruguayan mentality cheating? Is it wrong? If Suarez is sent off for stopping England scoring with a handball on the line that expels us from this summer’s tournament, he’ll soon find out.","Poyet warns England that Uruguay are prepared to cheat their way to victory .

"By . Sam Cunningham . Follow @@samcunningham . Criticism: Patrick Vieira has claimed France officials have let players down . Patrick Vieira has criticised France officials for running their national team badly and claims they have 'let down' their international players. The midfielder was at the heart of a period of French domination in the late 1990s and early 2000s when they won the 1998 World Cup on home soil and then the Euros two years later. But he believes the structure in place back then was allowed to crumble by those running football in the country. 'In France you are talking about Samir Nasri and some of the other players having personal issues,' Vieira said. 'But Samir never had a problem with Manchester City. They talk about Karim Benzema, but he never had a problem with Real Madrid. Franck Ribery never had a problem at Bayern Munich. 'So I think it is the structure that creates that kind of problem. The French national team has to look at itself, how the structure is done. That is not as strong as City, Bayern or Real Madrid. 'The problem is that you need people above who dictate the rules. It is like parents. When you have a kid, who are shown the rules, the kids know where to stand and what to do and what not to do. 'If there are no rules, people do what they want. The structure in the French national team in the last few years wasn’t at the best.' Shock: Nasri was left out of France's provisional World Cup squad, supposedly for disciplinary reasons . Vieira, however, feels the tide is finally turning following recent turbulent years. They crashed out of the 2008 European Championships and 2010 World Cup in the group stage, one of their worst results in either competition. 'When I was playing it was a different structure,' Vieira added, speaking at the launch of ITV's coverage of the World Cup in Brazil this summer. 'Every player knew where they were, what they had to do and how they had to behave. 'When I was there, the majority of the players had big experience. I think the average age was around 30. This one is younger. In the last few years the French team had been a bit younger. 'When you are young you need more people around to support you, and I think the players have been let down by the structure around them. 'It has changed because they have a new president now, who has been working and been changing the manager and people around him. 'Now I think the French team is more solid and when you look at what they’ve been doing in the last few games it’s because the structure around is more clear.'

We’re looking out over Orient’s small Brisbane Road stadium, with room for only 9,271 fans but that number added to by the blocks of new-build flats which punctuate the four corners and overlook the smaller stands.

He breaks out into an enormous chuckle when he says: ‘I’ve got one of them, why do you think I’m working so hard?’ Property gag: Slade stands in Brisbane Road and he joked that the flats behind him will boost in value if Orient can secure promotion . Promotion in sight: Romain Vincelot celebrates with Orient fans after the play-off semi-final win over Peterborough . It is another joke, he actually rents one from his chairman Barry Hearn. ‘I’m doing him another favour,’ he adds, still laughing. ‘I think it’s great for the community, I really do. ‘There was a pop-up pub during the 2012 Olympics, it’s called the Leyton Technical Pub now, it’s come to life a little bit in the years I’ve been here. ‘The Olympics was great for it and if the football club get into the Championship that’ll be great for it and the rest of the community too.’ Perhaps Slade’s down-to-Earth persona, his appreciation of how his work really impacts on others, comes from his unorthodox route in to football. Man at the top: Orient chairman Barry Hearn will hope his side can secure promotion to the Championship . As a player he was a defender, not tall enough at 16 but when he shot up at 18 he had the chance to play for Notts County.

When he finished there he went to Nottingham where he got his first job at Frank Wheldon school, but six months in he was already taking time off to coach and play reserve matches for Notts County. ‘I took the under 15s for six months, then I was taking the under 16s, and that second year I was still teaching I was playing in the reserves,’ he explains.","Leyton Orient face Rotherham in Sunday's League One play-off final .

The Lancashire spinner had been with Alastair Cook's men at Trent Bridge before being sent to get some county overs under his belt as they began a County Championship game against Nottinghamshire in Liverpool. Kerrigan got the chance to turn his arm over briefly at Aigburth and will link up with the international side imminently, with the Red Rose allowed to bring in a replacement. Back: Simon Kerrigan has been named in the England's second Test squad to face India to start this week . Bore at Trent Bridge: Alastair Cook's side drew the first Test on a flat pitch in Nottingham . Nobody has been dropped from the squad, with the spinner coming in as the 14th member of the Test party. That sees Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes, not selected for the opening game of the series, included too. Selecting Kerrigan signifies an about-turn by England following the appointment of Peter Moores as coach earlier in the year. It had looked as if the 25-year-old was set for an international exile after a difficult debut against Australia at the Oval last year. He was carted around the park during eight difficult overs that eventually went for 53, but has rediscovered some form so far this season, taking 28 Championship wickets, and Moores knows all about him given the pair's previous relationship at Old Trafford. England selector Mick Newell, who is also Nottinghamshire coach, said at Aigburth on Sunday: 'Simon Kerrigan is the key man, he is very much the future for England.' Experience: Kerrigan suffered after being selected for England against Australia at the Oval last summer . The player himself appears buoyant after finding his form again, saying recently: 'Since the last innings of the Warwickshire game at Edgbaston, I've felt really good about my bowling. 'This game has been a little bit of a step back, but I'll keep plugging away and doing what I'm doing, and hopefully I'll get back to my best. 'Over the last three weeks, it's been getting to where I wanted it to get to. There's still progress to be made, which is the same with any bowler I guess. 'But I work hard at my skills, as hard as anyone, and hopefully I'll get to where I want to get to.'

The striker played 548 minutes through the tournament and Van Gaal feels he requires an extended rest in order to be fully fit and firing before the start of the new Premier League season. 'I need that,' Van Persie said. 'It was a tough tournament. Every match I gave it my all. That was just it, more wasn't possible.'

VIDEO Disbelief in Belo Horizonte after devastating Germany win . What . is it about Belo Horizonte and humiliation? Sixty-four years before . Brazil suffered in the city, England were humbled in the biggest upset the World Cup has seen. The United States had lost seven matches in a . row with an aggregate goal difference of minus 43; England arrived as . the ‘Kings of Football’ and huge favourites. ‘We have no chance,’ said . US coach Bill Jeffrey. But the Americans – an assorted bunch of teachers . and postmen – soaked up pressure and scored in the first-half through . Joe Gaetjens, and then held on for the unlikeliest of wins. Legend has it . some newspapers were so confused by the scoreline coming from South . America they thought it a typo and reported England had won 10-1. Shock loss: Alf Ramsey watches as England goalkeeper Bert Williams is beaten by Joe Gaetjens' shot . The . Brazil players from this match at the Maracana might at least get some . respite now. For decades they have symbolised dramatic failure in the . country which cradles the game like no other, wearing the result like . an albatross around their necks. They had been expected to easily dismiss . Uruguay, a nation of 3 million, in the final match – a draw would have . been enough to lift the trophy – and 200,000 fans crammed into the . famous stadium in anticipation. Friaca gave the hosts the lead but Juan . Alberto Schiaffino equalised before Alcides Ghiggia hit the winner goal . with 11 minutes left. The term Maracanazo, roughly translated as ‘The . Maracana Blow’, was born. Hosts horror: The last time Brazil staged a World Cup they  unexpectedly lost the final match to Uruguay . This . was the match that shattered English hubris and swept aside malaise. Billed as the ‘Match of the Century’, bringing the originators of the . game versus the No 1 team in the world, England were supremely . confident. They had never lost at Wembley and players such as Ferenc Puskas . were unknown on these shores. But the Hungarians’ innovative 2-3-3-2 . formation and fluid lines showed England’s WM system to be outdated, . while fitness and coaching methods were also exposed. Nandor Hidegkuti . scored a hat-trick, Puskas got two and Jozsef Bozsik one as England were . trounced. For the first time, English managers started to look to the . continent for tactical and training advances. Revolution: England's 6-3 defeat against Hungary at Wembley sparked a major rethink in the English tactics . Liverpool . had won their 17th First Division title by nine points, losing only two . matches, and had collected four European Cups in the previous 11 years. Wimbledon were a rag-tag group of players more famous for their ‘Crazy . Gang’ moniker than trophies, never before lifting a major piece of . silverware - indeed, they had only just completed their second ever season in the top flight. But on a sunny afternoon at Wembley Bobby Gould’s team . pulled off a stunning victory. Shortly before half-time, Lawrie . Sanchez’s header from a Dennis Wise free kick looped over Bruce . Grobbelaar and into the net. Dave Beasant then became the first . goalkeeper to save an FA Cup final penalty to deny John Aldridge and Wimbledon held on. History: Lawrie Sanchez celebrates after heading Wimbledon in front against Liverpool in the FA Cup final . Crazy Gang: Wimbledon went on to beat Liverpool and lift the 1988 FA Cup against the odds . Barcelona . were the team of Romario, Hristo Stoichkov, Ronald Koeman, Pep . Guardiola and Miguel Angel Nadal. They were not short of talent, confidence or know-how, having won the European Cup two years . earlier at Wembley. Johan Cruyff was their manager. They had only . conceded three goals in seven previous matches in the Champions League in 1993-94. But . at the Olympic Stadium in Athens, Fabio Capello’s Milan produced a . performance from the gods to lift the trophy in breathtaking style. Daniele Massaro got two, Dejan Savicevic scored a beautiful lob, and . Marcel Desailly added the exclamation mark to complete one of the . greatest displays in the competition’s history. Silverware: Paolo Maldini holds the European Cup aloft following Milan's 4-0 win against Barcelona in Athens . The Italian job: Daniele Massaro scores the first of his two goals for AC Milan against Barcelona . Remember . the time Emile Heskey produced his DJ celebration in Munich to add a . surreal gloss to England’s most celebrated victory on foreign soil? It . seems such a different time. Victory for Germany, after a 1-0 win at . Wembley earlier in the campaign, would have sealed their place at the . 2002 World Cup. But Sven Goran Eriksson masterminded a remarkable . performance that allowed his team to get to the Far East first. Carsten . Jancker opened the scoring early to give the game a familiar feel but . then Michael Owen grabbed a hat-trick, Steven Gerrard scored a screamer, . and Heskey added the coup de grace. Huge satisfaction against old . rivals and a shock scoreline. Triumphant: England's 5-1 win against Germany in Munich is still remembered as one of the iconic results . Treble top: Michael Owen hit a hat-trick for Sven Goran Eriksson's side on that night in Munich . Hosts . bombing at crucial moments is not the sole preserve of Brazilians. Portugal could have won the European Championship on home soil, . claiming their first trophy in the process, only for Greece to arrive . like a Trojan horse and crash the party. The two sides had met in the . opening game of the tournament with the same result but Portugal had . grown and looked set to avenge the defeat. A young Cristiano Ronaldo and . an ageing Luis Figo could do nothing to stop the Greek game-plan of stifling . and set-pieces as Angelos Charisteas headed in the only goal from a . corner.

"By . Kit Holden . It has been a summer of bank breaking transfers. At almost all of Europe's major clubs, there has been a changing of the guard, and an expensive one too. Barcelona have shelled out £75million for Luis Suarez, Real Madrid over £80million for James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos, and Manchester United and Liverpool have spent millions plundering Southampton. In all the commotion, only Bayern Munich have remained quiet. And yet, In Robert Lewandowski, they appear to have pulled off the coup of the year. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewandowski score two for Bayern Munich against Wolfsburg . Quality: Lewandowski has settled in well to life at new club Bayern Munich . Hot property: Luis Suarez is one of the best strikers in the world . Golden boy: James Rodriguez was outstanding at the World Cup . After a disappointing campaign for Barcelona last term it has been no surprise to see them therefore splash the cash, with the £75million purchase of Suarez the stand-out deal of the summer so far. The former Liverpool striker brings his baggage but at the same time undisputed quality, and with Alexis Sanchez departing the Nou Camp for Arsenal, he'll provide timely assists and goals when he returns in November from his four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini. However, it was most certainly a surprise to see their arch-rivals spend £63million on Rodriguez. Granted, he had a superb World Cup with Colombia and was one of, if not the player of the tournament. But with the plethora of attacking options at Carlo Ancelotti's disposal including the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema, there is no guarantee the former Monaco striker will be guaranteed of much first-team football at the Bernabeu. Pedigree: The 25-year-old was outstanding for Borussia Dortmund during a four-year spell . Bearing in mind Madrid won the Champions League and Copa del Rey last season, it could be seen that the signing of Rodriguez is more a signal of intent to sent out to their rivals, rather than one that was a necessity. So with that all mind Bayern could have come out of this with the top trump - that in being Robert Lewandowski on a free transfer. The 25-year-old had four prolific years at Borussia Dortmund and after rejecting their offer of a new contract in January, Bayern finally had their man after a four-year hunt. After a league and cup double in Pep Guardiola's first season at the club Bayern could have been forgiven for letting their foot off the gas and sticking put with what they already have, but their capture of Lewandowski signals a real statement of intent and at a bargain price. Prolific: Lewandowski has been a success on the international stage as well as domestically . Guardiola was clearly enchanted with Lewandowski. He said: 'He is a top, top player. He's just got everything. Congratulations to Bayern for signing him!' £75m - Luis Suarez (Liverpool to Barcelona) £60m - James Rodriguez (Monaco to Real Madrid) £50m - David Luiz (Chelsea to PSG) £32m - Diego Costa (Atletico Madrid to Chelsea) £30m - Luke Shaw (Southampton to Manchester United) £30m - Alexis Sanchez (Barcelona to Arsenal) Free - Robert Lewandowski (Borussia Dortmund to Bayern Munich) Congratulations are indeed in order. Bayern had spent the best part of three years trying to prise Lewandowski away from Borussia Dortmund, and in the end they played their hand expertly. It could prove to be one of the greatest bargains in Bayern's history. At 25, Lewandowski arrives in Munich with his prime years right in front of him. More importantly, though, Lewandowski is Guardiola's man. The Catalan's attitude to the striker is in stark contrast to his relationship with the Lewandowski's predecessor, Mario Mandzukic. As many players have found to their chagrin over the years, a clash of egos with Guardiola can see anyone frozen out of a team. United: Lewandowski and his teammates celebrate his goal against Wolfsburg on Sunday . Mandzukic fell out of favour last season, with the player not even travelling to Berlin to celebrate Bayern winning the Double. The Croatian's style of play was also less suited to Guardiola's philosophy. A surprising amount of Bayern's goals last season came from crosses, set pieces and headers. At times, they looked muted when trying to pass through the gaps of their opposition. Lewandowski will add a dynamism to that forward play which Mandzukic lacked. Lewandowski, it would seem, is one of the last, crucial pieces in the Guardiola's jigsaw.","The new Bayern Munich striker appears to be a very shrewd acquisition .

Varane made just 12 starts in La Liga last season after suffering a knee injury, but he did play the entirety of Real's extra-time win against rivals Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final.

As United will not have European football this season, they will often be playing just one match a week, thus limiting the first-team opportunities available to Evra.
