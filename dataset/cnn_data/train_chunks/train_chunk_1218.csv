"Google should be broken up if it won't stick to European Union competition rules, members of the European Parliament said today. European Union lawmakers overwhelmingly backed a motion urging antitrust regulators to get tough on Google and other Internet search engines over allegations of biased search results. The resolution was passed with 384 votes for versus 174 against and is the strongest public signal of Europe's concern with the growing power of U.S. tech giants. The Google headquarters in Mountain View, California: European Union parliamentarians say the online search and advertising company should be broken up if it won't apply EU competition rules . 'Clear adoption by EP of digital single market motion, including unbundling for search engine if needed,' Spanish liberal lawmaker and co-sponsor of the bill, Ramon Tremosa said on Twitter. Google is the target of a four-year investigation by the European Commission, triggered by complaints from Microsoft, Expedia, European publishers and others that it promotes its services at their expense. The resolution did not mention Google or any specific search engine, though Google is by far the dominant provider of such services in Europe with an estimated 90 percent market share. The lawmakers called on the Commission, in charge of enforcing fair competition in the European Union, to consider proposals with the aim of unbundling search engines from other commercial services. The European Parliament in Brussels: The resolution was passed with 384 votes for versus 174 against and is the strongest public signal of Europe's concern with the growing power of U.S. tech giants . While the legislature has no power in the matter, the call to the Commission is intended to increase pressure on new antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager to act quickly. Technology lobbying group Computer & Communications Industry Association, whose members include Google, eBay Facebook, Microsoft and Samsung, said unbundling was an 'extreme and unworkable' solution. 'While clearly targeting Google, the parliament is in fact suggesting all search companies, or online companies with a search facility, may need to be separated. This is of great concern as we try to create a digital single market,' it said.","Google is accused of biasing its search results in favour of own services .

"Former far-right leader Tommy Robinson controversially appeared at Oxford Union last night - and told students fears over racism led to child abuse in Rotherham. Mr Robinson was the leader of the English Defence League - a group that been accused of inciting racial hatred and 'Islamophobia' - but he stood down last year. His invitation to speak at the famous university had been criticised by his opponents and 200 people signed a petition calling for the event to be cancelled. Former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson spoke to students at Oxford University last night . His appearance has been criticised by opponents, who claimed the Union was 'encouraging fascism' A group of protesters - holding anti-fascist and trade union banners - stood outside the prestigious union last night and reportedly shouted abuse at Mr Robinson as he arrived. Mr Robinson, who was jailed for mortgage fraud earlier this year but is out on licence, claimed he was given a list of things he 'couldn't say' by probation officers. The 32-year-old - real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - told MailOnline: 'Even though I wouldn't have been breaking any laws, I was told I would be taken back to prison if I spoke about the police.' He insisted the atmosphere inside the union was 'civilised' and he was not heckled during his one-hour, twenty-minute speech. Mr Robinson told students about the roots of the EDL and claimed it was a response to the 'religious intolerance' of some Muslims in his home town of Luton, Bedfordshire. Talking about recent  child abuse revelations in Rotherham, he said: 'Fear paralysed Rotherham’s police force, the media and the politicians. The police facilitated the rape of children for 20 years because they were afraid of being called racist.' He claimed Woodhill Prison, where he was sent after being jailed in January, is an 'ISIS training camp' where 'the radicals are running the wings'. Mr Robinson insisted that, despite protests outside, the atmosphere inside among students was 'civilised' Mr Robinson is the latest controversial guest of the union, which previously invited Nick Griffin to talk . The union, which has previously hosted BNP leader Nick Griffin, had been strongly criticised for allowing Mr Robinson to appear. A letter by Oxford Unite Against Facisim stated: 'By inviting Tommy Robinson the Oxford Union is contributing to a climate of Islamophobia which only encourages fascists onto the streets of Oxford. 'The Oxford Union should not be giving racists and Islamophobes the prestige of speaking at their institution and we demand Robinson's invitation is withdrawn.' But students at the university have taken to Twitter to defend the decision, insisting the talk was in the interests of free speech. Some students on the social network this morning stated that they did not agree with Mr Robinson's views on Islam, but were pleased to they had heard him speak.","Union sparked anger by inviting the controversial figure to speak .

"A turkey running on a treadmill isn’t something you see every day - or at all. But, a researcher has been putting the animals through their paces to try and find out the science behind running. And he claims the results will not only reveal more about how the birds' muscles work, his research could also apply to humans. Scroll down for video . A scientist from Brown University in Rhode Island has been studying turkeys (stock image shown). Specifically, Dr Roberts has been researching how they run on treadmills. In a video, one turkey is seen running in slow motion - all in the name of science . The turkey on a treadmill experiment is being run by Dr Thomas Roberts from Brown University in Rhode Island. He told MailOnline the purpose of the experiment was to understand how muscles function to move the body around. Forget robots designed to look like humans, in the future machines are more likely to resemble ostriches or dinosaurs. Scientists believe the efficient way flightless birds - and their ancestors - move around on two legs could usefully be employed in robot design. A study last month demonstrated how an ostrich's speed, energy conservation and ability to stay upright is unmatched in other animals, including humans. 'Birds appear to be the best of bipedal terrestrial runners, with a speed and agility that may trace back 230 million years to their dinosaur ancestors,' said lead researcher Dr Jonathan Hurst, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State University. ‘Even seemingly simple activities that we take for granted, like walking, involve dozens of muscles performing complex mechanical actions, and incredibly coordinated pattern of neural control, and some involved physics as well,’ he said. His goal is to understand how the whole process works, and he claims turkeys are an excellent model to understand how muscles power movement. In addition, they can be very tame and are easy to keep, while the wild strain of turkeys are good runners. Certain breeds are able to run a mile in about six minutes, and sometimes even faster. He admits he’s ‘not particularly interested in turkeys,’ but rather how their movements can be applicable to humans. ‘Understanding how turkeys move can help us understand how people move, because the physical challenges are much the same - we all have to support our body against gravity, for example - and our muscles work in the same way,’ he said. Dr Roberts told MailOnline the purpose of the experiment was to understand how muscles function in turkeys (stock image shown) when they run. His goal is to understand how the whole process works, and he claims turkeys are an excellent model to understand how muscles power movement . Dr Roberts' research could apparently help us understand how muscles make bodies move. And it is not just applicable for turkeys, but for humans as well (stock image shown). 'Our discovery of the energy-saving role of springs in turkeys has since been observed in humans muscles,' he said . ‘For example, our work on turkeys has shown that the springy behavior of tendons allows the animals to essentially “bounce” along the ground when they run, just as someone would bounce on a pogo stick. 'This reduces the work muscle must do and may protect the muscles from the kind of damage that causes muscle soreness. 'Our discovery of the energy-saving role of springs in turkeys has since been observed in humans muscles. 'Springs are now an essential part of the design of the most sophisticated limb prosthetics, and this design was inspired in part by animal studies that show the usefulness of springs in movement. 'And the study of animal models includes some seemingly odd behavior, such as researchers training turkeys to run on treadmills.'","Scientist from Brown University in Rhode Island has been studying turkeys .

"An alleged Queensland Rebels gang member has been charged with encouraging a child to take the drug ice. A two-year-boy was taken to a Brisbane hospital in June after an intervention by police that resulted in the child being removed from the home. Now, a 27-year-old alleged member of the Rebels who has been charged with supplying drugs to the toddler. The shocking news comes as Queensland police Taskforce Maxima have pulled off dozens of raids in a bid to thwart a drug trafficking network with bikie links. Police entering an outlaw motorcycle gang's clubhouse in Coffs Harbour. Queensland police Taskforce Maxima have pulled off dozens of similar raids on Thursday in a bid to thwart a drug trafficking network . An alleged Queensland Rebels gang member has been charged with encouraging a child to take the drug ice . The Rebels-the oldest and largest bikie club in Australia-have been subject to extensive nationwide raids across the country . Superintendent Michael Niland revealed the details of the case on Thursday after the arrests of more than 80 people allegedly involved in an extensive Queensland drugs syndicate run by the Rebels motorcycle gang. The Rebels are the oldest and largest bikie club in Australia, having some 70 chapters and over 2000 members across the country. Among those arrested by Taskforce Maxima was a 27-year-old alleged member of the Rebels who has been charged with supplying drugs to the toddler. 'We will be alleging that he encouraged the child to consume methamphetamine,' Supt Niland told reporters. Also arrested was a 28-year-old alleged gang member who has become the first person in Queensland to be charged with recruiting under anti-bikie gang laws introduced last year. Police seized $5 million worth of drugs, including 3kg of MDMA, 2kg of cocaine, 4kg of ice, 85kg of cannabis and 60 vials of steroids. Eight members of the Rebels bikie gang, including the alleged sergeant-at-arms of the Tweed Heads chapter, have been charged with drug offences under Queensland's anti-bikie legislation . After the raids, Supt Niland told reporters 'We will be alleging that he encouraged the child to consume methamphetamine' Police seized $5 million worth of drugs in the raids on Thursday, including 3kg of MDMA, 2kg of cocaine, 4kg of ice, 85kg of cannabis and 60 vials of steroids . About $500,000 in cash was also seized. The raids follow a 14-month investigation into the alleged Rebels ring. More than 200 police from specialist teams in Queensland, NSW and the AFP were involved in the raids. Dozens of search warrants were executed over the past 24 hours across Brisbane, Pine Rivers, the Gold Coast, Dalby, Gympie and Jimboomba. Eight members of the Rebels bikie gang, including the alleged sergeant-at-arms of the Tweed Heads chapter, have been charged with drug offences under Queensland's anti-bikie legislation. In October last year, the Queensland government passed the Vicious Lawless Association Disestablishment Act, a series of laws intending to dismantle outlaw motorcycle gangs. The laws require anyone committed of a serious offence while a participating in outlaw bikie gangs to be declared a 'vicious lawless associate,' in turn having mandatory 15-year jail terms added to their sentence. The act also give powers to prosecute anyone for the 'crime' of meeting in public. This month, the Queensland High Court rejected a challenge to overturn the laws that came from The United Motorcycle Council.

"Let Toys Be Toys are celebrating today after retail giant Marks and Spencer announced that it will ensure all toys stocked in store are gender neutral by the spring. The parent-led group campaigns against gender stereotyping in toy shops, and started putting pressure on Marks and Spencer at the beginning of the year. Mystery shoppers for the campaign found toy marketing at the store to be one of the most gendered on the high street with Marks and Spencer selling a wide range of science and tech-themed toys branded as 'boy stuff', and craft toys marketed only to girls, branded 'Lil' Miss Arty'. Marks and Spencer announced on Twitter that from Spring onwards all their toys will be gender neutral . Everyday Sexism argues that Marks and Spencer aim toys, like the 'Lil' Miss Arty' craft range enforce gender stereotypes . Mystery shoppers for the campaign found toy marketing at M&S to be one of the most gendered on the high street . Kerry Brennan from Let Toys Be Toys said, 'We're really pleased that Marks and Spencer have publicly committed to leave behind these outdated stereotypes. Girls can enjoy tech and science, and boys love arts and crafts too - why turn them away? It's especially good that Marks and Spencer are tackling their packaging too, as the problem of sexism in the toyshop goes far beyond just the retailers’ signs. 'In many stores, pink-and-blue colour coding, gender-specific packaging and promotion of toys continue to send the message that some interests are only for boys, and others only for girls.' Marks and Spencer’s announcement is part of a wider trend on the high street. Twelve toys retailers have agreed to take down gendered signs after contact with Let Toys Be Toys, and the group's recent survey of the high street across the UK and Ireland showed a 60 per cent reduction in shops using ‘Boys’ and ‘Girls’ signs in their toy departments since the campaign was formed a year ago. Marks and Spencer's announcement is part of a wider trend on the high street, which has seen twelve toys retailers agreeing to take down gendered signs . Kerry Brennan from Let Toys Be Toys said, 'We're really pleased that Marks and Spencer have publicly committed to leave behind these outdated stereotypes' Laura Bates, founder of Everyday Sexism says: 'I understand that for some people this may sound like a minor issue, but it isn't until you have heard the hundreds of stories we've received about little girls genuinely believing they 'aren't allowed' to be doctors because science is a 'boy thing', or asking if they can be turned into a boy so they can go into space, that you realise the true impact gendered toy marketing really does have on young children. 'Why cordon off science, adventure, technology and engineering as 'boys' toys' from such a young age when only one in ten UK engineers is female and we're struggling to recruit enough women into STEM careers? 'Why send the message to boys at a young age that dolls, or cooking are only 'for girls'? Don't we want them to grow up to be great parents and partners too? It's the sort of issue that some people will scoff at, but when you stop and really think about it, removing gendered toy division really is an important step forward.' Marks and Spencer say on the issue: We offer a wide range of fun and educational toys which are designed to appeal to children regardless of gender. 'We always listen carefully to feedback from our customers and based on this a decision was made earlier this year that by spring next year all our toys will be gender neutral.'","Parent-led group Let Toys Be Toys campaigns against gender stereotyping in toy shops .

"A paedophile doctor went on a church mission to an African orphanage ten days before he abused two young cancer patients. Myles Bradbury, 41, was part of a 15-strong group that went to Swaziland to help orphaned children in 2012. He travelled with the KingsGate Christian Evangelical Church from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, to help children whose parents had died from Aids. Paedophile doctor Myles Bradbury went on a church mission to an African orphanage days before he abused young boys in the UK, it has emerged . A photo from the trip - during which Bradbury was left alone with children - shows him with other members of the church group . The trip came at the same time that Bradbury was abusing vulnerable boys at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. He was arrested in December last year and is to be sentenced after he admitted abusing 18 boys in his care between 2009 and 2013. Police said they had no evidence to suggest Bradbury offended on the trip to Bulembu but others on the team confirmed he was left alone with the orphans. Each volunteer was allowed to be alone with up to six children in the afternoons for two to three hours, they said. A spokesman for the KingsGate Church said: 'We are shocked and deeply saddened at the actions of Dr Myles Bradbury and at the devastating impact that these have had on the lives of many. 'As soon as the charges against him were revealed in early July 2014 we promptly contacted Bulembu. 'Bulembu then instituted a detailed investigation to make sure that he had not had any one-to-one contact with children during that time. 'They found no evidence that he had any unsupervised involvement with children and was always accompanied by community development project staff.' Police have said there is no evidence that Bradbury (pictured, right) used the trip to abuse children . The church says they contacted officials in Bulembu (pictured) as soon as Bradbury was arrested . Bradbury used tiny video cameras hidden in pens to film himself abusing young cancer patients, it emerged earlier this month. Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge suspended him after a child's parents complained about an 'intimate examination'. Police traced Bradbury's rubbish and unearthed a laptop but the memory inside had been removed, and with it potential evidence of further offences. However a disc containing 16,000 images of child abuse and two specially adapted spy pens were found in a garden annexe. Each had a small camera above the clip. Footage was downloaded by plugging it into a computer. A two-day sentencing hearing of Bradbury, from Herringswell, Suffolk, will begin tomorrow and is due to conclude on Monday. Mistakes by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) meant Bradbury was left free for 16 months to wage his campaign of abuse. The doctor bought a DVD in 2005 from Azov Films in Canada. The company advertised on its website ‘just legal’ and ‘naturist’ films but many were clearly illegal - and were bought by paedophiles in over 50 countries around the world. The site was finally closed down by Toronto police in the summer of 2012 and concerned officers in Canada soon dispatched the names of its customers to authorities in other countries in an operation called Project Spade. CEOP was handed a list of 2,235 suspected British paedophiles in July 2012 by Canadian police - but did nothing for months. Canadian police told British authorities about suspected paedophiles including Bradbury as part of a worldwide operation called Project Spade . It was only when the centre was absorbed by the National Crime Agency last November that Bradbury's name was passed to Suffolk police and his home was raided. In the intervening time he had continued his abuse and made his trip to the African orphanage. Among the other suspects named on the list handed over by Canadian authorities was that of teacher Martin Goldberg, who was found dead a day after police first contacted him. Following the 46-year-old's death, a search of his house in Shoeburyness, Essex was conducted and 7,257 indecent images of children that he had downloaded from the internet were found. Three police forces in Britain - Essex, North Yorkshire and North Wales - are under investigation for allegedly failing to act on the child porn intelligence, it emerged earlier this month.","Predator is awaiting sentence for abusing 18 boys in his care at hospital .

"The first ambulance crew to arrive at Sydney Cricket Ground to treat Phillip Hughes came from almost 10km away from the city's busy inner west, paramedics have claimed. The Australian Paramedics Association says the vehicle from Summer Hill, in Sydney's inner west, was the closest vehicle to the ground when the first emergency call was made at 2.29pm on Tuesday afternoon. Questions have been asked as to why an ambulance took 23 minutes to arrive at the SCG when the normal response time is under 10 minutes. The delay prompted Health Minister Jillian Skinner to demand the head of Ambulance NSW offer an explanation. The first ambulance crew to arrive at Sydney Cricket Ground to treat Phillip Hughes came from Summer Hill, almost 10km away from the stadium . The first triple-0 call from the SCG was made on Tuesday at 2:29pm, almost six minutes after Phillip Hughes was struck in the head by a ball during a match. That ambulance did not arrive until 23 minutes after the call, apparently due to a lack of vehicles in the area, paramedics say . The ambulance which responded to the first emergency call did not arrive at the SCG until 23 minutes after the call, apparently due to a lack of vehicles in the area. According to Sydney Morning Herald, Gary Wilson, the secretary of the Australian Paramedics Association of NSW, claimed that there was a backlog of patients at Sydney hospitals at the time of the accident, meaning paramedics could not respond to new emergencies. 'Standard practice is that, if there's no ambulances available in the immediate vicinity, they will send the closest available resource. Our understanding is that, in the Hughes incident, that crew was from Summer Hill,' he said. The ambulance service has been criticised in recent days for taking so long to respond to the first emergency call made from the SCG . When the first ambulance failed to appear at the SCG, officials at the SCG made a second triple-0 call. The second triple-0 call was made at 2:37pm and an ambulance was sent to the SCG from the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick, arriving seven minutes later at 2:44pm and before the first ambulance. According to Mr Wilson, it is likely an ambulance had been freed up between the first and second triple-0 calls, possibly by offloading a patient or another emergency call being cancelled. A lone bat was placed out the front of the Sydney Cricket Ground member's entrance where Phillip Hughes was hit in the head by a ball during a cricket game . Mr Wilson also said that trolley-block was a major source of frustration for paramedics. Trolley-block happens when the hospitals are overcapacity and therefore there are delays in responses to emergency calls. In a statement, NSW Ambulance clarified that all measures were taken to ensure the closest ambulance was dispatched to the SCG. 'The NSW Ambulance Helicopter, with a specialist doctor and paramedic on board, as well as another road ambulance were tasked to respond while the first two ambulances were en-rout,' the statement read. Phillip Hughes, pictured left as a boy growing up in Macksville and right as a professional cricketer, is being mourned across Australia . 'St Vincent’s was identified as the closest hospital. A road ambulance transport was determined by the medical team to be the fastest and safest route to hospital care,' 'NSW Ambulance always tasks the closest available paramedic crew to all Triple Zero (000) emergency calls regardless of the station at which their shift originates,' Mr Hughes was taken to St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney with significant head injuries. The 25-year-old died due to severe head injuries sustained by a bouncer at the Sydney Cricket Ground . He underwent major surgery but died on Thursday afternoon. 25-year-old Phillip Hughes was due to turn 26 on Sunday. The Australian Paramedics Association of NSW have blamed budget cuts on the delays in ambulance responses and highlighted the daily issues faced by paramedics. 'Consideration was given to seeking a meeting with the Minister for Health however based on the continued position of the Ministry of Health that no funds are available or will be made available to fund additional positions this was not seen as a productive option,' they said. 'The continued line that an additional 5% is added to the NSWA budget each year is not satisfactory as it is being swallowed up by other costs.' The APA continue in light of the tragedy, claiming that they are forced to deal with limited resources and their pleas for additional funds and facilities are falling on deaf ears. 'As tragic as this recent event is in the public eye, paramedics see this type of tragedy on a regular basis. Is it any wonder why profession has a high incidence of suicides and post traumatic stress disorder?' the statement said. NSW Ambulance told Daily Mail Australia that they will not be making any further comment on the incident,pending an inquiry into their practices.","An emergency call was was made at 2:29pm, almost 6 minutes after Phillip Hughes was struck in the head by a ball at the Sydney Cricket Ground .

"It's a world away from Berlusconi and his bunga bunga parties, but at least Tony Blair can always rely on an Italian Prime Minister to seat him next to some pretty girls. Blair dined with his acolyte, Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi, and MPs during a private visit to Rome and looked thrilled to be seated between two of Europe’s youngest and most glamorous cabinet ministers. Maria Elena Boschi, 33, Minister for Reform, regularly graces the cover of magazines such as Vanity Fair while Marianna Madia, 35, Minister for Public Administration, has drawn comparisons to Rossetti paintings.

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi (left) chatting with former British prime minister Tony Blair before a dinner  at Chigi's Palace in Rome, Italy . Mr Renzi, who took office after making a ruthless power grab earlier this year, styles himself as Italy’s Tony Blair. He has long held the former British PM as a role model, but last week the writer of the House of Cards series, Margaret Thatcher’s former chief-of-staff Lord Dobbs, counselled the Italian leader not to model himself too far on Blair. He said: 'A good politician should be respected not loved…I suggest that Renzi put on some iron boots like those Thatcher wore and gets to work.’ Blair, wearing a grey suit and red tie, enjoyed a low key pizza night at Palazzo Chigi, the Prime Minister’s official residence. MPs and ministers shared pizzas and drank water or coke. Ruthless: Mr Renzi has long held the former British PM as a role model . Blair, wearing a grey suit and red tie, enjoyed a low key pizza night at Palazzo Chigi, the Prime Minister’s official residence. MPs and ministers shared pizzas and drank water or coke . When the former politician paid visits to flamboyant ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi he was treated to serenades and a spectacular fireworks display with the words Viva Tony written in the sky. Cherie later described it as ‘the best night of her life.’ It is Blair’s second visit to Italy in recent months. Over the summer he enjoyed a family holiday with Cherie and two of his four children on the picture perfect island of Lipari popular with private yacht owners. He has slid in popularity recently in Italy as he is currently advising on a highly controversial pipeline project to bring gas from Azerbaijin via one of Italy’s most pristine beaches. The project is currently stalled after fierce local opposition as campaigners say it threatens marine wildlife including the endangered monk seal. This week Blair was also embroiled in a furore, but over a charity award. The boss of Save the Children yesterday admitted the decision to honour the divisive former Prime Minister had created ‘global repercussions’ for its reputation. File picture . Save the Children faced a growing wave of protest as donors, volunteers and a celebrity ambassador for the charity condemned its decision to give him a high-profile anti-poverty award. Angry former supporters took to social media to say they would be cancelling regular donations, and more than 100,000 people signed a petition demanding the charity withdraw the ‘global legacy award’. The charity’s boss yesterday admitted the decision to honour the divisive former Prime Minister had created ‘global repercussions’ for its reputation. Save the Children International chief executive Jasmine Whitbread sent a humiliating email apologising to staff for not consulting them about the award, saying they had been ‘blind sighted’. But she also issued a lengthy defence of the decision to grant it. On Twitter comedian Dom Joly wrote that he was ‘pretty embarrassed’ to be an ambassador for the charity ‘when they hand out awards to Tony Blair for his “anti-poverty” work’, adding: ‘I can only assume they meant his own, personal poverty?’","Former British PM was sat with Maria Boschi and Marianna Madia .

"The new host of Newsnight Evan Davis has revealed he tears up at the sight of thousands of migrants who have set up camp in Calais in the hope of gaining entry to the UK. Mr Davis, who has a holiday home in Normandy, said driving past the desperate crowds of foreigners, most of whom have travelled to France from north Africa, makes him emotional. The journalist's comments come as he prepares to host the BBC Two current affairs programme for the first time on Monday. Scroll down for video . The former BBC Radio 4 host said he often cries and that travelling to and from his second home in Normandy past the migrants in Calais made him emotional . Speaking about his tendency to cry, the 52-year-old said he 'couldn't bear' to think about getting emotional while on air, but broke down during an interview when asked about migrants in Calais. Thousands have set up camp in the French coastal town in desperate bids to gain entry to the UK by storming ferries preparing to cross the Channel. Mr Davis said seeing their makeshift tents and pleading signs begging for human rights makes him cry whenever he takes the Channel crossing to visit his second home in Normandy. The journalist said the sight of migrants who have set up camp in Calais in a desperate bid to gain entry to the UK made him cry . Thousands have descended upon the coastal town and set up make-shift tents to try and force their way into the country. Sleeping bags and dirty blankets line a concrete courtyard in one camp (pictured) Security measures have been considered to control the swelling crowds of migrants who have jumped on to lorries and hidden themselves in cars to make the crossing between France and England . Mr Davis, who has never presented live television before, added he wanted to introduce a softer tone to the late-night programme. 'As a political value, I have a deep-rooted belief about the world that I don't want alpha males making all the decisions,' he told the Sunday Times Magazine. 'I would like more thoughtful people to have a bit more of a say over things,' he said.","Evan Davis said sight of migrants in Calais 'sets him off every time'

"The victim of a random street attack has shared images of the moment she chased her violent attacker down for a photo that led to his arrest. Erica Moloney, from Toorak in Melbourne's south-east, was on her way to the train station after a gym class in the CBD when a passing man suddenly punched her in the face. 'I didn't even see it coming because I was on my phone, he knocked the glasses off my face,' Ms Moloney told Daily Mail Australia of the attack, which occurred on Wednesday night. 'I just slumped down, I was so shocked.' Scroll down for video . Erica Moloney, from Toorak in Melbourne's south-east, was on her way to the train station after a gym class in the CBD, when a passing man suddenly punched her in the face . Furious and confused, the 32-year-old chased down her assailant to snap a photo of him (pictured). After demanding to know why he had hit her, the man said to her: 'do you want another one, you stupid b****?' The 32-year-old, who was comforted by a nearby hotel-owner, then did what most people wouldn't. Furious and confused, she went in search of her assailant. 'I was so confused and didn't know why anyone would do this. My instinct just kicked in and I wanted to see who did it and I wanted to get a snap of him, because that's how you can potentially get the guy,' Ms Moloney said. 'I think adrenalin had kicked in. They say people have either a fight or flight response, but I guess I have third option which is ""photo"".' The brave woman then took to social media to share images of both her bleeding face and her attacker, warning others to stay away from the man . Ms Moloney praised police and paramedics for their quick response. The man was arrested within an hour of punching her . When she finally found her attacker, just up the street, Ms Moloney yelled out to him from 10 metres away, demanding to know why he had hit her. 'He responded by saying: ""do you want another one, you stupid b****?"" That riled me up a little bit,' she said. The brave woman then took to social media to share images of both her bleeding face and her attacker, warning others to stay away from the man. But within less than an hour, after paramedics had cleaned up her face, the man walked by as she was giving her statement to police. One day after the attack: 'The bruising will fade, but everyone's love and kindness in the face of senseless violence will stay with me forever - thank you!' Ms Moloney posted to her Instagram account . 'I spotted him and recognised him from the photo and said 'that's him'. The policeman taking my statement just stepped outside, called for back-up and they were on the scene pretty quickly and apprehended him,' Ms Moloney said. A 33-year-old man has since been charged with a series of alleged crimes committed on Flinders Lane, including two counts of recklessly causing serious injury, The Age has reported. Still shaken by the incident, Ms Moloney hopes to share her story in an effort to help others get through their own violent encounters.

While she says she has received 'an overwhelming amount of support' since the incident, she admits a few people have warned her about being in 'the rough end of town'. 'It was 7:30 at night. I should be able to walk from a gym class to a train station,' she said. 'I think the thing to take away is that random things can happen and they can be horrible, but don't let it bring you down and don't let it run your life .

"At 11.11am on Monday, 27 November 1944, a mushroom cloud, 50 yards wide, rose high above the village of Hanbury, Staffordshire. Mounds of earth, weighing up to a ton each, fell to the ground after being lifted skywards. A nearby reservoir that had contained six million gallons of water was burst open. And a massive crater - 100 feet deep and 250 yards wide - was blasted into the unspoiled landscape. This lasting scar, the Hanbury Crater, is a reminder of when the 4,000 tonnes of bombs and ammunition kept in the underground storerooms of RAF Fauld, Staffordshire, detonated in a single, deadly moment. The accident, Britain's biggest ever explosion, claimed the lives of at least 70 people and tore down homes in the nearby village of Hanbury. Untamed: While the area of the crater, seen above in 2005, is home to birds and wildlife - humans are not allowed to walk across it . Lasting mark: The 1944 explosion blasted a massive crater - 100 feet deep and 250 yards wide (seen from above) - into the landscape . Scarred: The 12-acre patch of countryside (circled) - which is now filled with trees and shrubs - is cordoned off because of unexploded bombs . Today, a poignant memorial was unveiled, marking the 70th anniversary of the explosion - one of the biggest non-nuclear blasts ever recorded. More than 100 people attended the service, with family and friends of the 70 people who were killed gathering at the Cock Inn in Hanbury - which was seriously damaged in the explosion - to mark the anniversary. A memorial service was also held at St Werburgh's Church in the Staffordshire village. The explosion was thought to have released about one-fifth of the force felt when the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. It was heard in Birmingham - 32 miles away - and seismologists in Switzerland thought they had detected an earthquake. The historic explosions occurred in 180,000 sq ft of underground corridors - 12ft high and 20ft wide - which were used to store RAF munitions during the Second World War. In these concrete passages, bombs and ammunition were tightly packed. During the wartime rush - when officers faced a shortage of quality manpower, and a higher demand on resources - corners were cut in the way the unit was run. Mark Rowe, who has been researching the explosion for 30 years, said an RAF inquiry into the explosion, which was only published in 1974, found it was an avoidable accident. Aftermath: The force of the blast, which killed at least 70 people, destroyed homes and shops in the nearby village of Hanbury, Staffordshire . Blast: Workers survey what remains in one part of the underground munitions storage unit at RAF Fauld after the devastating explosion . Wreckage: An RAF inquiry into the explosion found it was an avoidable accident. Above, a building brought to the ground by the blast . Crushed: Part of the tunnel is seen collapsed on top of one of the rows of bombs that were stacked underground during the Second World War . He added: 'The most likely explanation, according to the report, was that someone tried to remove an exploder pocket with a brass chisel. That caused a spark which set off the reaction.' The report concluded: 'An airman was permitted to perform a dangerous operation in the mine. This indicates negligence on the part of the supervising staff present in the mine due either to lack of knowledge, lack of a proper sense of responsibility, or lack of proper direction from senior authority.' A solid underground wall meant that much of the underground storeroom did not go up on the blast - and a number of the men working made it to the surface on time. Most of the deaths, roughly 31 in total, came at a nearby plasterboard factory, when the blast broke a reservoir that sent a volcano-like sea of mud down a valley and engulfed everything in the way. Damage: One worker ventures underground to assess the extent of the destruction caused by the bombs, which detonated simultaneously . Devastating: This photograph shows just one of the nearby homes that were struck by the force of the blast . Fatal: Most of the deaths, roughly 31 in total, came at a nearby plasterboard factory. Above, the collapsed tunnel photographed after the blast . The rescue work took three months and was hindered by pockets of gas, 6 million gallons of water from the reservoir and 10,000 tons of rubble. Tragically, 18 of the 70 people killed were never found. The giant crater left behind by the blast is still visible 70 years on but is now filled with trees and shrubs and is home to birds and wildlife. There are also signs warning ramblers or passers-by not to go into the area - which covers a 12-acre patch of countryside - because of unexploded bombs. Near the edge of the crater is the first memorial for the tragedy, where the names of those who lost their lives are carved. A service used to be held at the site every year until a decade ago when numbers dwindled and it was dropped after the 60th anniversary. Parish council chairman Trevor Iball said: 'There was much more interest in that than a service by the crater and the parish council are supporting it. What remained: Despite the force of the blast, parts of the underground storage facility survived. Fauld only ceased holding explosives in 1958 . Tribute: A sign near the edge of the crater remembers those who lost their lives. Sadly, 18 bodies were never recovered in the search operation . Tranquil: A service to remember those who died in the explosion is held every year at Hanbury Crater, pictured above . 'There has been a big response. We believe the RAF at Stafford and the Ministry of Defence will be among the people attending. I think it will be a fitting way to mark the anniversary. 'The outdoor services began when the memorial was erected 30 years ago but ten years ago there was only three of us, including the vicar. There was one lady who lost her brother but she admitted that it was getting beyond her.' Reverend Les Rees, who conducted the service, said: 'We want to mark the anniversary for the village. People are still affected by it, it left its mark. 'At British Gypsum we will be unveiling the new memorial plaque and there will a short act of worship. There were people from different parts of the church killed, the Italian PoWs would have been Catholic. 'It's not just a Church of England event but for the whole community.'","The underground munitions storage depot at RAF Fauld, near Hanbury, Staffordshire, exploded in November 1944 .

"Parents of an infant pleaded guilty to placing heroin on their infant son’s gums in 2008 because he was teething. The child, identified only as ‘Baby JM,’ died a short time later from heroin intoxication. Denise Manco, 35, and 37-year-old Rondell Moore of Toms River, New Jersey, entered guilty pleas earlier this week to one count of second-degree manslaughter, Ocean County prosecutors said today. Just how the 11-month-old boy ingested the heroin had remained a mystery until investigators in Ocean County got new information in the Seaside Heights case in October. Confessions: Denise Manco, 35, left, and Rondell Moore, 37, pleaded guilty to rubbing heroin on their infant son's teeth in 2008 . Tragic: Baby JM's parents admitted to rubbing heroin on his gums while he was teething, resulting in his death . On September 12, 2008, Baby JM was found unresponsive at their home in Seaside Heights by local police. Despite being rushed to the Community Medical Center in nearby Toms River, the boy was declared dead. In October of 2012, new, credible information came to light that the toddler did not ingest the drug by accident, though the prosecutor’s office would not reveal what the specific new information was. Seaside Heights’ police chief Thomas Boyd told the New Jersey Star-Ledger that the parents’ actions were ‘unfathomable.’ He added: ‘You just sit back and you ask is the world going crazy, or am I?’ Authorities say both defendants admitted placing heroin in the baby's mouth and rubbing it on his gums because he was teething. According to the Asbury Park Press, both people could face a sentence of up to 10 years if convicted. Their sentencing is scheduled for next month.","Denise Manco, 35, and Rondell Moore, 37, pleaded guilty to placing heroin on infant son's gums when he was teething .

"Set on the edge of the Chiltern Hills within easy reach of London, Beaconsfield has attracted politicians and celebrities as a place to live for decades. But the picturesque location comes at a cost. Research shows its residents now pay £500,000 more to live there than elsewhere in Buckinghamshire. The trend is repeated across the country, albeit to a lesser extent, with an average premium of £25,000 on homes in market towns, according to Lloyds bank. Research shows Beaconsfield residents pay £500,000 more to live there than elsewhere in Buckinghamshire . Homes in such locations have risen in value by an average of £500 a month over the past ten years – and two-thirds of market towns in England have an average house price that is above average for their county. Wetherby has the second highest premium with prices £157,000 above the West Yorkshire average, followed by Bakewell in the Derbyshire Peak District, where homes cost £147,000 more. One in eight market towns in the survey have an average house price at least £100,000 higher than the rest of their county. Beaconsfield not only comes with the highest premium but is also the most expensive market town in the country, with the average home now costing £823,000. Petersfield, in Hampshire, where homes cost £402,000, and Cranbrook, Kent, where they cost £394,000 are the next most expensive. Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, which is in David Cameron's constituency and is home to television presenter Jeremy Clarkson, also made the top ten with an average price of £352,000. Outside southern England, Bakewell is the most expensive market town with an average property value of £315,000, far in excess of the UK's average of £274,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. But if buyers are intent on living in a market town, the North East may be the place to look.

"Gwyneth Paltrow has had her Hollywood home targeted with a series of anti-Obama posters ahead of a fundraiser that the actress is holding for the president on Thursday evening. The signs, including one featuring an image of Paltrow with the phrase 'Obama drone' on it, are the work of an artist called Sabo who creates street art with a clear Republican slant under the name Unsavoryagents. The 42-year old actress got full view of the posters as she arrived home on Wednesday. They’ve been plastered to electricity boxes and hung over the road for everyone to see around her upscale neighborhood of Mandeville Canyon, Brentwood. Scroll down for video . Gwyneth Paltrow has had her Hollywood home targeted with a series of anti-Obama posters ahead of a fundraiser that the actress is holding for the president on Thursday evening . Happy to be home? The actress didn't look best pleased to discover that her L.A. home has been surrounded by highly critical posters of her and President Obama . Another poster depicts an image of the President that has been ripped down the middle to separate him from the American flag and features Gwyneth's infamous phrase 'conscious uncoupling' on it. The @unsavoryagents Twitter account tweeted a picture of the Paltrow poster earlier this month along with the text: 'Party at Paltrow's place!!! God I wish we would do somethign to shut this thing down.' On Tuesday Sabo also tweeted that he was seeking ‘a face painter who’s willing to work for free ASAP for the Paltrow project.’ A section of Sunset Boulevard will be closed for Thursday's high-profile event, which is slated to attract some of the entertainment industry’s most prominent names. Close to home: The parody posters have been put up around Gwyneth's home and one lampoons her infamous  'conscious uncoupling' phrase . President Obama boards Air Force One prior to departing from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to  travel on a three-day trip to California for economic events and to attend fundraisers such as that being held by Paltrow . The President was pictured leaving the White House earlier on Thursday to fly to California. He is scheduled to spend the next three days in the state attending economic events and Democratic National Committee fundraisers. Ticket prices for the event at Paltrow's home range from $1,000 to over $32,000. Sabo’s art is reminiscent of acclaimed street artist Banksy and Shepard Fairey, who designed the 2008 Obama Hope poster, although Unsavoryagents’ artwork has a very clear Republican message. For the last 15 years, the L.A-based artist says he has been creating works in an effort to be 'the other voice.' 'The left is constantly telling people that anyone (who is not left) is bigoted or misogynist,' he told Fox News. 'All of the voices (at art school) are leftist… The Republicans have a great story with no one to tell it.' Statement: The posters have been put up to coincide with a Democratic fundraiser happening at Paltrow's place on Thursday . According to the Unsavory Agents Facebook page, the company’s mission is not only to 'let the art world know that the left-wing will no longer hold art hostage' but to 'get more non-leftists interested and to participate in the arts.' 'Our art is politically minded, right-wing centric, brutal, street level, and hard edge,' the page reads. 'Our means are achieved by any creative means necessary.' Previous targets have included Jon Stewart, Samuel L. Jackson and Alec Baldwin. Paltrow is a long-standing Democrat supporter and was even an active member of Democrats Abroad when she lived in London with ex-husband Chris Martin. She previously hosted a re-election fundraiser for Obama in 2012. Is this Sabo?

"More than 100,000 Romanians have applied for the right to work in Britain since the autumn of 2013. The count of Romanians who asked for National Insurance numbers – necessary for anyone who wants to work legally in Britain – has risen nearly fivefold in a year. The explosion in numbers of Romanians came alongside a sharp rise in applications from Bulgarians for National Insurance documents. Queue: Romanians living in Portsmouth line up to cast their vote in elections in their home country earlier this month . There were 31,500 Bulgarians who applied for and received their numbers in the year up to September – more than double the total in the previous 12 months. Yesterday’s official figures point to a large-scale movement into Britain of citizens of the two Eastern European countries which joined the EU in 2007 and whose citizens were given the right to work freely in Britain from January. They tally with predictions from the Migration Watch think tank which projected that the economic draw of jobs and benefits in Britain would bring in 50,000 people a year from two of the poorest countries in the EU. They suggest that some analysts, including those from the BBC, who declared earlier this year that there had been no new influx from the two countries, were badly off target. National Insurance applications, counted by the Department for Work and Pensions, show the number of people who applied for the documents they need to work rather than numbers newly arriving in the country. Presence in Britain: Romanians gather outside their embassy in London two weeks ago to protest that they were unable to vote in the election . They appear to include a large number of people who were already in Britain before Romanians and Bulgarians were given the right to work in January. Sarah Crofts, of the Office for National Statistics, said that half of those applying for National Insurance numbers were ‘people who had been in the UK for a year or longer’. The ONS analysis raises the possibility that many of the Romanians and Bulgarians may have been working illegally in Britain in the black economy. ONS immigration figures said immigrants in the year to June 2012 included 32,000 people from Romania and Bulgaria. Of these arrivals, 24,000 are estimated to have come to Britain to work. The 103,900 National Insurance numbers issued to Romanian citizens in the year to September represented a 468 per cent rise on the 18,300 applications recorded in the previous 12 months. The 31,500 National Insurance numbers issued to Bulgarians was a rise of 205 per cent on the 10,300 in the previous 12 months. In the run-up to the European elections in May, the BBC claimed that there were 4,000 fewer Romanian and Bulgarian workers in Britain in March than in January. Its political editor scoffed: ‘So much for those predictions of a flood of immigrants coming from Romania and Bulgaria once the door to the UK was opened.’ However the BBC and other analysts who came to the same conclusion were using figures from the Labour Force Survey, an ONS research survey that has too small a sample to provide an accurate count of small groups within the population. National Insurance number applications, on the other hand, provide a fully accurate count of actual people who want to work legally in this country.","31,500 Bulgarians applied for and received NI numbers in year to Sep .

Parents have agreed to spend more time in the bedroom in a bid to create more children to save the closure threatened schools in a Danish town (file picture) So as part of a deal, local authority Thisted Council has agreed to keep the institutions open for the next four years if parents promise to create new children to fill their places. It came after parents pleaded with the authority to keep the schools open. Council spokeswoman Ulla Vestergaard told broadcaster DR: 'When it comes to partnership deals, it’s all about cooperating with many local actors to build up a synergy. 'It’s a cooperation, and not just with the parents. We need to get the falling birth rates turned around.' The Danish town of Thy where the council has agreed to keep schools open if parents create more children to fill the empty places at them . She added that politicians would actively try to stop people from moving away from the area if the parents kept up their end of the deal. Estate agents and banks in the area also promised to convince people to stay in the town. The deal comes after it was revealed that birth rates across Denmark are continuing to drop as women put off having children until they are older. This has prompted the Danish Family Planning Association to teach youngsters the importance of not leaving it too late to have children as part of sex education in schools. The average age of a first time parent in Denmark is 29, which is five years older than it was in 1970.","Schools in the Danish town of Thy had been threatened with closure .

"Stephanie Gilmore has a lot to be grateful for this Thanksgiving Day. The Aussie pro surfer says winning the 2014 women's world surfing title in Hawaii on Thursday came at a very 'appropriate time'. Needless to say the 26-year-old is on cloud nine having won her sixth ASP World Champion title, the Target Maui Pro, the event Gilmore won her first world crown at in 2007 as a rookie. The six-time world champion, of Murwillumbah in far north-eastern NSW, spoke to Daily Mail Australia just a couple of hours after the competition as she struggled to come to terms with her big win. Stephanie Gilmore with the ASP World Title trophy after clinching her sixth ASP World Title at the Target Maui Pro at Maui, Hawaii on Thursday . The Aussie pro surfer won her first world title at the same even back in 2007 when she was a 19-year-old rookie . Gilmore entered the event as the defending champion, having claimed consecutive victories at this world-class break in 2007, 2008 and 2009, the last time a world tour event was held at Honolua Bay . 'It's pretty hard to sum up how I feel at the moment and everything feels so surreal,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I feel incredibly happy and emotionally drained as it's been quite a wild day. 'But I think it's all happened at a very appropriate time seeing it's Thanksgiving Day here.' Gilmore won her sixth world title after making the quarterfinals as teammate Sally Fitzgibbons, ranked number 2 in the world, was eliminated from the contest by South Africa's Bianca Buitendag in their quarterfinals heat. World number 3 and Aussie Tyler Wright was eliminated by Hawaii's Carissa Moore in the contest final. Winning this particular competition has been momentous for Gilmore, who won her first world title at the same event during her rookie year at the age of 19. 'I won my first world title here and am speechless that today I've won my sixth world title at Honolua Bay, a break I dreamed about surfing as a kid,' she said. 'This is a very special place for me as I fell in love with this place back then and now I've fallen in love with it even more.' The world champion, from Murwillumbah in far north-eastern NSW, first began surfing at the age of 10 . Gilmore says she has her dad to thank for introducing her to the world of surfing. She began competing at the age of 12 . Looking back, Gilmore can't fathom how far she's come. She says she's grateful that her dad, who's also an avid surfer, took her out years ago to catch her first wave. 'I began surfing at the age of 10 with dad and loved it so much that I started competing when I was 12,' she said. 'I really didn't expect to come this far.' But despite her celebrating win, Gilmore's thoughts were with the grieving family and friends of Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes who died yesterday after being struck by a ball on Tuesday afternoon. 'I didn't know him but I was just as shocked and heartbroken when I heard the news,' Gilmore said. 'It was clear that he was seen as a true champ to not only the cricketing world but also to the Australian sports people. 'I know it's been a tough few days back in Australia so this really puts things into perspective for me.' Gilmore says winning her sixth world title feels 'surreal' and 'emotionally draining' Gilmore's world champion titles include 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2014 . In December 2010, the young champion's whole life came to stand still after a random attack left her in emotional turmoil with head and wrist injuries to boot. She had been making her way back to her apartment in Coolangatta, New South Wales, when she noticed a random man from a car park she'd walked through, run at her with a metal bar in one hand. The then 22-year-old was left with head and wrist injuries and told she couldn't surf for the six weeks leading up to her next competition. This year Gilmore spoke out about how she overcame her trauma to rise back to the top of the surfing league in the feature film, Stephanie In The Water. Gilmore's world champion titles include 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2014.","Pro surfer Stephanie Gilmore has won the 2014 women's world surfing title, the Target Maui Pro, in Hawaii .

"When it comes to taking the best photographs, there's nothing better than torrential rain. New research from Nikon reveals that images of weather beat family, food and weddings as the most impressive pictures online. Travellers aged 25-34 year olds are most likely to take 'wethies' (weather photos) with  half  taking one at least once a week and one in ten every day. Scroll down for video . Dramatic: A purple and pink skyline makes a beautiful backdrop for a fishing boat on shingle bank at sunset at Dungeness, Kent . Close to the action:  Professional storm chasers monitor an approaching tornado in western Kansas on May 8, 2008 . The poll found two in five Brits say they are more impressed by friends' pictures of the weather, versus photos of their family (13 per cent), weddings (6 per cent) or food (5 per cent). More than a third  admit a good weather photo is one of their favourite things to see online and 40 per cent say they are more impressive because of the high level of skill necessary to  take. However, despite sunsets (52 per cent), snow (39 per cent) and rainbows (31 per cent) topping the list of most photographed weather, three in five feel that their pictures don't do the natural phenomenon justice. When asked which weather condition would be hardest to photograph, over half of respondents agreed on lightning. All the colours in the rainbow: A multicoloured streak across the sky frames a barn in Elmley Marshes National Nature Reserve, Kent . Sometimes the calmest weather shots can be the most spellbinding. Here is Corfe castle and village in Dorset in morning mist . A stab in the dark: This incredible image shows cloud-to-ground lightning bolts striking a field in eastern Wyoming . Across the country, Londoners were found to be the most likely to shoot the weather, with 41 per cent taking pictures up to seven times a week; this drops to just 24 per cent in Scotland and 26 per cent in the East Midlands. One in ten Brits now say they only take weather photographs when they're on holiday. Nikon weather photography expert, Jim Reed says: 'I've been photographing weather for over 30 years and it never ceases to amaze me. It is an ever-changing subject and has the ability to take your breath away with its beauty and power. 'It's great to see people investing in their pictures and more and more people using DSLRs to capture the weather in all its glory - especially as we are seeing more extreme weather phenomena around the world.' Light and dark: Multiple tornadoes are captured illuminated by lightning in a memorable shot by weather photographer Jim Reed . Perfectly simple: Cattle grazing below the perigee moon or supermoon, in the North Kent Marshes . Nikon analysis of Twitter conversations confirms that weather is a growing topic for discussion amongst Brits. Conversation peaked in early August and early October, most likely due to the unusually warm spells, with mentions of 'cold' and 'weather' increasing by more than 800 per cent in one week between September 27th and October 6th. Out of Twitter weather mentions,  research shows that sunsets were more than twice the amount talked about than sunrises. If all this talk of weather inspires you to want to get out there with your camera, weather photographers, Robert Canis and Ross Hoddinott provide their top tips forgetting the perfect shot: . Misty seascape: This was taken in March this year at sunset at Trebarwith Strand with an incoming tide . Stormy seas: Waves explode over a seawall and into Galveston, Texas as Hurricane Ike approaches on September 12, 2008 . 1. Weather (41 per cent) 2. Family (13 per cent) 3. Weddings (6 per cent) 4. Night out (5 per cent) 5. Food (5 per cent) 6. Sports events (3 per cent) 7. Babies (3 per cent) Sunsets: Keep a mental note of locations and subjects close to home or your work place that would look good at sunset. Head out when there is medium cloud cover and don't fill the frame with just the sky, look for silhouettes that allow light to pass through its details allowing the subject to be recognisable such as a leafless tree or pier. Mist: To capture mist, an early start is essential. Longer focal lengths will help compress perspective and allow you to highlight subjects and shapes shrouded in the mist. Sunrise: Often the best dawn colour is a good 15-30 minutes before the sun actually appears. In this type of low light, exposure time will be slow, so always use the stability of a tripod to ensure your images are shake free. Rainbows: Try attaching a polarising filter - using one can help saturate the rainbow's colours and make it standout out even more. Use the filter with care, though; as they can also have the reserve effect and make them disappear if rotated incorrectly! Storms: Keep a close eye on the forecast for strong winds, sunshine and showers and remember to pack something to cover your camera in case of a deluge. Be safe. In the case of lightning avoid open areas as metal objects such as tripods and camera don't mix! Fog: Fog acts as a giant diffuser and simplifies the scene so look for narrow streets and alleyways or an avenue of trees in the local park. Shoot into the sun and if you are lucky try to get the rising sun burning through the fog .","New research by Nikon found that nearly half of 25-34 year olds take at least one weather snap a week .

"Is he or isn't he? New research could end the misery of trying to read the signs of someone's sexual orientation. Scientists say a person's pupil will shoot open when they become aroused, helping those on the prowl know whether or not they will get lucky. Eye-le! The secrets of a person's sexuality is hidden in their eyes, a new study reveals . Pupil dilation has long been known to track the level of someone's excitement. Pupils open slightly when a person sees a puppy dog or a friendly face. But now researchers say reading optical reflexes could solve the conundrum of guessing which team a person is playing for. The sex study, conducted by Dr Ritch Savin-Williams and  Gerulf Rieger of Cornell University, monitored 165 men and 160 women, including gay, straight and bisexual participants. The subjects' pupils were studied as . they screened one-minute videos of a man masturbating, a woman . masturbating and neutral landscape scenes. Optical disclosure: New research from Cornell University suggests pupil dilation is an accurate indicator of sexual orientation . Straight men reacted to sexual images of women, gay men responded to sexual images of men and bisexuals respond to both men and women, the results showed. But women, in traditional fashion, were far more complex. Gay females had pupil dilation after seeing sexual images of other women but straight women dilated similarly in response to erotic images of both sexes. This doesn't mean that all straight women are secretly bisexual, Dr Savin-Williams warned, just that their subjective arousal doesn't necessarily match their body's arousal. Sex researchers can't explain why this would be but some theorize the response is a survival mechanism given the risk of female rape. A woman's body could respond to a sexual stimulus, regardless of its appeal, for her own protection. The next phase of the study would be monitoring pupil measurements and genital measurements simultaneously, though researchers admitted some subjects get a little squeamish having their genitals under scrutiny.",Cornell University research shows pupil dilation may indicate sexual inclinations .
"An elderly swimmer has been banned from using her local pool on her own because of health and safety regulations. Maureen Blake, 76, has spent the past 11 months using the indoor swimming pool at the Holiday Inn  as she bids to improve her fitness ahead of a knee operation. However, bosses at the hotel in Hertfordshire have now told Ms Blake that she will no longer be able to use the facility unless she has a carer with her because of fears over her safety. Maureen Blake, 76, has spent the past 11 months using the swimming pool at the Holiday Inn hotel in Elstree . Ms Blake claims she had visited the pool each morning accompanied by a group of friends, and that her daily trips are an important part of her social life. She said that many of the people who swim at the hotel in Elstree are older than herself. However, staff say that it is against the hotel’s policy to allow anyone who requires assistance getting in and out of the pool to swim unaccompanied as the facility is unmanned. Ms Blake was asked by the hotel's management to get a form signed by her GP that stated she would be able to swim unaided, which the doctor decided not to do. But Maureen has insisted she is capable of visiting the pool alone, telling the Borehamwood Times: ‘I’m broken-hearted. I used to get up at quarter to six every morning to go there as it was only about a mile. Pensioner Ms Blake lives in Borehamwood in Hertfordshire and has used the pool at her local Holiday Inn for the past 11 months as she bids to improve her health ahead of a knee operation . ‘My life was so different but now sometimes I don’t get dressed until three or four in the afternoon. ‘It was lovely there – I’d made friends with so many lovely people, most of them older than myself, but it seems to be just me that can no longer go.’ Holiday Inn has now refunded one month’s membership, but insisted that Mrs Blake will also need to have a form signed by her doctor to be able to use the pool in the future. Angela Fairgrieve, general manager of the hotel, said: ‘The safety of our guests and our employees is our primary concern. ‘The pool at our hotel is unmanned and therefore we ask all guests who require assistance whilst entering and exiting the pool not to swim unaccompanied in case of an emergency. 'Ms Blake is welcome to swim in the pool provided her doctor gives her the all clear to swim unaccompanied. Her safety in an unmanned pool is our primary concern.'","Maureen Blake was a regular visitor to Holiday Inn in Elstree, Hertforshire .

"Attorney General Eric Holder went on the . defensive on Tuesday explaining why the Justice Department secretly . obtained two months worth of reporters' telephone records in an . 'unprecedented' search for a confidential source. 'This was a very serious leak and a very, very serious leak,' Holder said at a press conference explaining the department's actions which have been criticized for going against the constitutional right to a free press. Holder said that he recused himself from the making the controversial decision to subpoena the phone records of Associated Press journalists, saying that it was made by Deputy Attorney General James Cole. WATCH THE VIDEO BELOW . Politicians versus press: Attorney General Eric Holder held a press conference on Tuesday to address the story that the Justice Department secretly obtained two months worth of journalists phone records . He said that he was 'confident that . the people involved in this … followed all applicable Department of . Justice regulations' even though he claimed not to actually know the . details of the decision-making process as a result of his recusal. President Obama was forced to follow . Holder's press conference with the release of a statement saying that . the incident does not shake his faith in his close friend and the . country's top legal adviser. 'The president has confidence in the attorney general,' press secretary Jay Carney said. The controversy came when the Associated Press reported that two months worth of reporters' telephone records without their knowledge, obtaining a wide breadth of records that had nothing to do with the leak of information that they were concerned about. The Justice Department has spoken in the past about how they were upset over the leak of information about a foiled al Qaeda plot where the terrorist group planned to detonate a bomb on a plane bound for the United States. 'I've been a prosecutor since 1976 and I have to say that this is among, if not the most serious, it is within the top two or three most serious leaks I've ever seen,' Holder said. Government-backed: Holder said that the records they obtained were pertaining to the search for a security leak that led to the creation of an Associated Press story about a foiled terror plot . Questionable: Holder reportedly recused himself from the decision and allowed his deputy to make the call . 'It put the American people at risk. That's not hyperbole. It put the American people at risk.' That isn't enough to satisfy critics, as top Republicans are already calling for Holder's resignation over the incident. 'Because Attorney General Holder has so egregiously violated the public trust, the president should ask for his immediate resignation,' Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said. 'If President Obama does not, the message will be unmistakable: The President of the United States believes his administration is above the Constitution and does not respect the role of a free press.' The records listed journalists' incoming and outgoing calls, as well as the duration of each call, for the work and personal phone numbers of individual reporters, general AP office numbers in New York, Washington and Hartford, Connecticut, and the main number for AP reporters in the House of Representatives press gallery, according to attorneys for the AP. In all, the government seized records for more than 20 separate telephone lines assigned to AP and its journalists in April and May of 2012. Supporter: Press Secretary Jay Carney was forced to issue a statement from the President supporting Holder . News of the probe into one of the . largest news organizations in the world immediately sparked outrage . among Republicans on Capitol Hill. 'The First Amendment is first for a reason,' Michael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, told MailOnline. 'If the Obama Administration is going after reporters’ phone records, they better have a damned good explanation.' Outraged: AP President and Chief Executive Officer Gary Pruitt, pictured, said the government sought and obtained information far beyond anything that could be justified by any specific investigation . A spokesman for Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said the move is representative of a broader 'pattern of intimidation.' 'Whether it is secretly targeting . patriotic Americans participating in the electoral progress or reporters . exercising their First Amendment rights, these new revelations suggest a . pattern of intimidation by the Obama Administration,' Doug Heye said. The American Civil Liberties Union was equally critical. 'Obtaining a broad range of telephone records in order to ferret out a government leaker is an unacceptable abuse of power,' said Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. 'Freedom of the press is a pillar of our democracy, and that freedom often depends on confidential communications between reporters and their sources.' AP President and Chief Executive Officer Gary Pruitt said the government obtained information far beyond anything that could be justified by any . specific investigation. He demanded the return of the phone records and . destruction of all copies. 'There can be no possible . justification for such an overbroad collection of the telephone . communications of The Associated Press and its reporters,' Pruitt wrote in a letter of protest to  Holder. 'These . records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources . across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a . two-month period, provide a road map to AP's newsgathering operations, . and disclose information about AP's activities and operations that the . government has no conceivable right to know.' The exact number of journalists who . used the phone lines during that period is unknown but more than 100 . journalists work in the offices whose phone records were targeted on a . wide array of stories about government and other matters. Records: In all, the government seized records for more than 20 separate telephone lines assigned to AP and its journalists in April and May of 2012. The government would not say why it sought the records (stock photo) U.S. officials have previously said in public testimony that the U.S. attorney in Washington is conducting a criminal investigation into who may have leaked information contained in a May 7, 2012, AP story about a foiled terror plot. The story disclosed details of a CIA . operation in Yemen that stopped an al Qaeda plot in the spring of 2012 . to detonate a bomb on an airplane bound for the United States. In testimony in February, CIA Director John Brennan noted that the FBI had questioned him about whether he was AP's source, which he denied. He called the release of the information to the media about the terror plot an 'unauthorized and dangerous disclosure of classified information.' Prosecutors have sought phone records from reporters before, but the seizure of records from such a wide array of AP offices, including general AP switchboards numbers and an office-wide shared fax line, is unusual and largely unprecedented. In the letter notifying the AP received Friday, the Justice Department offered no explanation for the seizure, according to Pruitt's letter and attorneys for the AP. The records were presumably obtained from phone companies earlier this year although the government letter did not explain that. None of the information provided by the government to the AP suggested the actual phone conversations were monitored.","Justice Department obtained records listing incoming and outgoing calls and duration of calls for more than 20 telephone lines used by journalists .

"Dug deep into a mountain which took 26 laborious years to construct at an astronomical cost of more than £3billion, this bunker is an abandoned relic of the former republic of Yugoslavia. The extensive 920 foot-deep U-shaped complex is dug into a mountain outside Konjic, 25 miles south of Sarajevo in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. Communist Yugoslavia's leader Josip Tito ordered the building of the bunker in 1953 to safeguard the country's ruling classes in case of a nuclear attack. The complex, spanning 6,500 square metres, was designed to allow 350 people to live and work for six months without ever coming up for air. It had its own generators, water supply and air-conditioning system. The existence of this atomic shelter that could withstand a nuclear attack strength of 20 kilotons - far more powerful than ones that were dropped on Hiroshima - was known only to Tito, his closest confidantes and and the handful of soldiers guarding it.

While Tito was viewed in some quarters as authoritarian, he was widely praised for developing a unique brand of socialism in his beloved Yugoslavia. He modelled his country on the Soviet Union, but after falling out with Stalin, chartered an independent course for the country. Yugoslavia became far more open than its communist neighbours, such as allowing visitors free travel to the west, and was seen by many as a paradise on earth. Tito also managed to maintain the peaceful co-existence of the nations of the six republics of Yugoslavia due to his internal policies. Although there was substance to Tito's Yugoslavia, much was illusion too. The economy was propped up by loans from the west and stirrings of discontent in Croatia and Kosovo were swiftly put down. Following his death in 1980, the state began to fall apart as the republics began to seek greater powers for themselves and the former federation disintegrated amid bloody fighting.","Bunker was dug into a mountain outside Konjic, 25 miles south of Sarajevo in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina .

"Sony, Samsung and Sega were among the winners at this year’s Pocket-lint awards. But it was Apple that scooped Gadget of the Year for its iPhone 6 - the first time any iPhone has been awarded the coveted accolade, despite its widespread popularity. The iPhone 6 also beat the HTC One (M8) handset to pick up the award for Best Phone. Apple scooped Gadget of the Year for its iPhone 6 at this year's Pocket-lint awards. It is the first time any iPhone has won the title during the awards’ 11-year history. The handset also beat the HTC One (M8) to pick up the accolade for the Best Phone . But its larger version - the iPhone 6 Plus - lost out on the Best Phablet accolade, which was awarded to Samsung’s Galaxy Note 4. Stuart Miles, founder and chief executive of  Pocket-lint told MailOnline: ‘It's the first time in the 11-year history that the iPhone has won at the awards, and it's clear that this is down to Apple's move to a bigger screen. ‘Apple has, according to the judging panel, industry, and the public, not only created a phone people want, but one that is worthy of winning an award too.’ Apple's iPad Air 2 scooped the Best Tablet title, while Tesco's affordable £129 Hudl 2 was close behind. The winners were decided by an panel of judges, the tech industry and the general public. The vote breakdown was 50 per cent from the panel, 40 per cent from the tech industry and 10 per cent from the public. Alien: Isolation (pictured left) was voted the most popular game, beating blockbusters such as Destiny and Far Cry 4. The judges liked the title because it is different from classic first-person shooters - and the alien itself can't be killed. Mario Kart 8 (right) was crowned the runner up . Sony’s PlayStation 4 (pictured) beat Microsoft's Xbox One to scoop the Best Home Entertainment Device award. The winners were decided by an elite panel of judges, the tech industry and the general public . Sega's Alien: Isolation was voted the most popular game, beating blockbusters such as Destiny and Far Cry 4. ‘There’s no question about it, games are getting more intelligent,' continued Mr Miles. 'You’re not just running down tunnels killing everyone you can. The Alien game is like the film, you can’t kill the alien so the best way to survive is by hiding.’ He said that the judges liked the game because it was different and a ‘slow burner’. ‘It’s a refreshing change. One of the judges said that they haven’t played it yet because they’re too scared. Games should evoke excitement,’ he added. Mario Kart 8 was the second most popular game, and this could be seen as a further move away from the traditional first-person shooter genre. Apple's iPad Air 2 scooped the Best Tablet title, with Tesco's affordable £129 Hudl 2 (pictured) close behind . All eyes were also on the wearables category, which was won by LG’s G Watch R (pictured), which unlike a lot of its competitors, has a circular screen. The more traditional Pebble Steel model was the runner up . Mr Miles continued: ‘If you look at what people are buying, games have to be clever and offer something different.’ One of the most divisive categories of the night was the award for the most impressive games console. But Sony’s PlayStation 4 pipped Microsoft’s Xbox One to scoop the 'Best home entertainment device' award. And all eyes were also on the wearables category, which was won by LG’s G Watch R, which unlike a lot of its competitors, has a circular screen. ‘It’s a forward thinking device and its design is breaking boundaries - not just any band will do,’ Mr Miles said.

"This kitten has been nicknamed 'Squitten' after being born with a deformity in her front paws that means she sits and walks on her hind legs like a squirrel. Petal, a five-month-old, suffers from a rare condition that means she has no bones after the elbow joint in her front legs so they are permanently bent inwards. She is unable to run like other felines and has no choice but to either waddle on her rear legs or slouch forward onto her crooked limbs. Scroll down for videos . 'Squitten': Petal, aged five months, is forced to sit up on her back legs because she has no bones after the elbow joint in her front legs . When she is not moving, the moggy often sits upright and looks a bit like a squirrel. Petal's condition - Radial hypoplasia - is believed to be the result of inbreeding among a group of unneutered cats kept in a house together. Her mother, Poppet, was taken to a cat rescue centre and gave birth to a litter of three kittens, but only Petal survived. Staff at the Yorkshire Cat Rescue in Keighley, West Yorkshire, took her to the vets who advised them to gently massage her twisted legs until she was old enough for an X-ray. Petal: Her condition - Radial hypoplasia - is believed to be the result of inbreeding among a group of unneutered cats kept in a house together . Squitten: Petal, the grey kitten, has been compared with a squirrel . When she was nine-weeks-old a scan revealed that she had the deformity, and although it is not life threatening, it could mean she has medical problems in the future. Pictures of Petal were posted on the rescue's Facebook page, and as a result she was adopted by Kerry Bowler, 35, who has another cat, Honey, with a similar condition. Sara Atkinson, founder of Yorkshire Cat Rescue, said: 'Petal's mum, Poppet, was brought in to us when she was pregnant. 'The owner didn't get the cats neutured and didn't let them outside, so the babies were inbred. She had three kittens, one was still born, another sadly died, but little Petal survived. 'We could see from a very early age that there was a problem, she would try and run around and when she stopped she would sit up like a squirrel. 'We nicknamed her ""Squitten"" because she looks like a squirrel as it sits back on it's hind legs and eats a nut. 'We took her to the vets and they said to massage her legs until she was old enough for an X-ray but there was no improvement. 'When she was about eight or nine weeks old we took her for a scan where we found out she had Radial hypoplasia. 'Some people think cats who have deformities need to be put down but this isn't the case, we wanted her have a comfortable and happy life and she now does.' Both Kerry's cats walk on their back legs like humans or lean forward onto their elbows and when they are not moving they sit up in a way that has been compared to a squirrel or meerkat. Rare condition: Petal's owners discovered she had the condition when she went for a scan aged nine weeks. She is being held here by Abbey Morris . Kerry, who is a support services officer in a mental health unit, from Perth, Perthshire, said: 'I was working in a veterinary practice when Honey was brought in and left in a box. 'She was just three-weeks-old and as soon as I saw her I knew I wanted to look after her, so I began enquiring about her front legs and seeing if she needed an operation. 'She had a heart murmur so any operation ran a risk, I sought advice from my vet, and also heard about a cat who had lived a normal life with the condition. Friends: Petal (front left) and Kerry Bowler's other cat Honey (back, and right) who has a similar deformity . 'I also set up a Facebook page to seek advice and in the end I decided not to go ahead with the operation. 'A friend sent me a link to little Petal and I messaged the rescue centre and said I would be more than happy to adopt her too. 'She is getting on really well and both her and Honey have become firm friends and have regular check ups to monitor them and make sure there are no health complications.' Brave kitten: Petal's mother, Poppet, was taken to a cat rescue centre and gave birth to a litter of three kittens, but only Petal (pictured) survived .","Petal, aged five months, has no bones after the elbow in her front legs .

"A former caretaker for Benjamin Netanyahu is suing the Israeli Prime Minister over allegations that he was mistreated and verbally abused by the leader’s wife, it was revealed last night. Meni Naftali - who is seeking around £110,000 in damages - claims he was repeatedly subjected to abusive language, including an ethnic slur, by Sara Netanyahu during his 20 months on the job. In one instance, Mr Naftali said that Mrs Netanyahu called him at 3am to complain that he had bought milk in a plastic storage bag instead of a carton, according to the lawsuit. Couple: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu listens to his wife Sara during a meeting last December . In another, Mr Naftali claimed that . she chastised him because some flowers in a vase were a day old, . comparing the residence to the French presidential palace. ‘She . flung [the flowers] to the floor, as she yelled at Mr Naftali - calling . him “a bad housekeeper”, and that something like that would never occur . in the “Elysee Palace”,’ the lawsuit says. Mr . Naftali also claimed that Mrs Netanyahu derided his ethnicity when he . ordered food for them in a hotel, implying that his Middle Eastern . background was somehow uncouth. She . allegedly told him: ‘We are Europeans. We are refined, we don't eat as . much as you Moroccans... You are fattening us and then when we are . photographed abroad, we look fat.’ Lawsuit: The former caretaker claimed that Mrs Netanyahu (right, with her husband) derided his ethnicity when he ordered food for them in a hotel, implying that his Middle Eastern background was somehow uncouth . Mr . Naftali also claimed that Mrs Netanyahu berated him for bringing his . children to the residence on Israeli Independence Day, a national . holiday. 'We are Europeans. We are refined, we don't eat as much as you Moroccans... You are fattening us and then when we are photographed abroad, we look fat' What Sara Netanyahu allegedly said . ‘While it was . clear that during the meal he could leave with them to his house, Mrs . Netanyahu did not like this and asked that the children leave the house . immediately,’ the lawsuit says. It . is the latest in a string of cases to taint Israel's first family, who . have been accused of enjoying an extravagant lifestyle while ignoring . the plight of the struggling middle class. Mr . Naftali, who is in his mid-30s, said he served in an elite military . unit before joining the staff as a bodyguard to Mr Netanyahu's two sons. Elysee Palace: Mr Naftali claimed that she chastised him because some flowers in a vase were a day old, comparing the residence in Israel to the French presidential palace (pictured) He . transferred to the housekeeping staff in February 2011 and remained . there until leaving in November 2012. Mr Netanyahu's office rejected the . claims in the lawsuit as ‘outrageous.’ Mrs . Netanyahu has been a lightning rod for criticism going back to her . husband's first term in the 1990s, when she was criticised for allegedly . squabbling with her staff and meddling in state affairs. Among . other things, she was accused of firing a nanny for burning a pot of . soup and of throwing a pair of shoes at an assistant. In . December, the prime minister came under fire after a watchdog group . obtained expense reports showing heavy spending on scented candles and . floral arrangements at his official residence. In a statement, Mr Netanyahu's office noted that Mr Naftali . filed the lawsuit after his request to receive a permanent position on the . staff was rejected. ‘If it was so bad for him at the prime minister's residence, . why did he ask to work there permanently?’ it said. The lawsuit was filed to the the Jerusalem district labour court in Israel.","Meni Naftali claims he was repeatedly subjected to abusive language .

"Mobile phones have overtaken purses and wallets as the top target for muggers, new crime figures have revealed. The Crime Survey for England and Wales said cash and wallets had ‘consistently been targets for thieves’ but the soaring cost of mobile phones had made them the number one target. New analysis of the figures, released by the Office for National Statistics this morning, found gadgets like iPhones are stolen in more than half of all muggings. Mobile phones like the Samsung Galaxy Round are being targeted by thieves because they are worth more than wallets, the Office for National statistics has suggested . The crime survey said the increasing cost of smartphones was making them ‘appealing targets for thieves’. Today’s report states: ‘As more people carry valuable electronic gadgets, these too have become desirable targets. ‘About half of theft from the person incidents involved the theft of a mobile phone, where previously cash and wallets/purses were most commonly stolen in this type of crime.’ Sat Navs meanwhile have replaced radios and CDs as the top target in car crime, according to this morning’s official figures. The report said: ‘Theft of electrical equipment such as satellite navigation systems occurs in about one fifth of incidents of theft from vehicles – a much higher proportion than ten years ago when more common targets for thieves were car radios and CDs.’ Computers and jewellery are the most commonly-stolen items in domestic burglaries. CCTV showing the dramatic moments a Hampstead Resident was attacked by scooter gangs wielding hammers earlier this year . Laptops, tablets and other home computers were stolen in nearly two fifths of domestic burglaries. It said: ‘The targeting of high value items was clear in domestic burglary in a dwelling where, after purses, wallets or money, the most commonly stolen items were computers and jewellery.’ According to the 2013/14 CSEW items such as CDs and DVDs were stolen in just one in twenty domestic burglary incidents compared with around one in five a decade ago. Overall, younger people were more likely to be victims of burglaries and muggings. The unemployed, meanwhile, were more than twice as likely to be burgled as people in work.","Crime Survey  said cash and wallets were no longer number one target .

"A devoted animal lover hopes to raise £3,000 for an operation to help her dog  who suffered horrific abuse by his previous owners. Tracey Toft and her partner Jonathan Smith, from Whitwood, West Yorkshire, rescued Harvey the Jack Russell and Patterdale cross breed last year. The two year-old dog had been  tied up and burned by his former owners, leaving him with severe scalds to his face and a broken leg. He also has a serious ear infection which urgently requires a £3,000 operation to remove his ear canal. Tracey Toft, pictured with her dog Harvey, is hoping to raise money for a much-needed operation to remove his ear canal . Harvey had been abused and neglected by his former owners, leaving him with severe scalds to his face, a broken leg and a serious ear infection . Tracey, 29, said: 'Jonathan agreed to having a dog if I found one that was free. I saw Harvey advertised as free to a good home. 'His previous owners said he suffered burns on a radiator but when we took him to the vets they said it was clear he'd been abused.' The couple's campaign has already raised £600 towards the surgery and they are planning on holding a dog show on Saturday to help with the drive. Now with new owners Tracey Toft and her partner Jonathan Smith, the two year-old Jack Russell and Patterdale cross breed is doing well and is on the road to recovery . Harvey has even qualified for the final of Scruffs Family Crossbreed Dog of the Year at the Crufts contest in March . 'It's so heartwarming that everybody is coming together for a dog they have never even met,"" added Tracey. 'I think it's because people are passionate about animals and Harvey had no defence to the abuse he suffered. 'The operation is not a life-saving one but his ear causes him a lot of trouble and he cries if you touch it.' Harvey has also qualified for the final of Scruffs Family Crossbreed Dog of the Year at the Crufts contest in March.

"United States Secret Service is investigating a photograph blasted out on Twitter which seems to show someone holding up a smartphone, displaying a picture of the ISIS flag, in front of the White House. The photo appears to have been taken at night on the pedestrian mall occupying what used to be part of Pennsylvania Avenue. The White House's north portico can be seen in the background. It was first tweeted on August 9 by an account that was later deleted. '[W]e are here #America near our #target :) sooooooooooooon,' read the message that accompanied it. Scroll down for video . ISIS taunted the U.S. with a photo taken in front of the White House, showing a smartphone displaying the terror group's flag . Hubris: In a gripping interview captured last month, an ISIS soldier in Syria boasts that his organization will capture America's seat of power . Later that day another pro-ISIS Twitter user whose account is named 'Conquer the tyrants'  reposted the photo with a separate warning. 'We are in your state,' it read. ''We are in your cities. We are in your streets. You are our goals anywhere [sic].' Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan told ABC News that his agency has 'an intelligence division whose mission is to assess information that we receive every day for dangerousness or potential threat level.' 'We are aware of the image and will take the necessary and appropriate follow up steps,' he said. The taunting message follows a separate photo first seen online on June 30, which appeared to show a hand-written note, in Arabic, dated June 20 and held up in front of the Old Republic Building in Chicago. 'Soldiers of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria will pass from here soon,' the note reads, according to an ABC News translation. A verse from the Quran follows, reading, '... and Allah is perfecting His light even though the disbelievers hate [that].' On June 20 another ISIS supporter captured this image in front of the Old Republic BUilding in Chicago -- tweeting it more than a week later along with a threat that 'Soldiers of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria will pass from here soon' 'Near our target': The White House photo was first tweeted by an account that was subsequently shut down . ISIS, the terror group that claims it has established an Islamic caliphate in parts of Syria and Iraq, has used social media as a propaganda tool, and ramped up those efforts after President Barack Obama announced on August 8 that he would approve airstrikes against the group in northern Iraq if they were necessary. A half-day later, the U.S. struck in what the White House said was an effort to guarantee the safety of American personnel in Iraqi Kurdistan, and to protect tens of thousands of Yadizis, a religious minority group. An American operations outpost in the Kurdish capital of Erbil, White House officials said then, was close enough to ISIS forces to justify limited military intervention. The Yazidis had escaped to a mountainside and were languishing without food or water. Obama took a victory lap on Thursday after Special Forces flyovers established that days of U.S. airdrops of supplies had been sufficient to sustain them long enough to escape. Pushback: Americans are giving as good as they get, with tweeted replies aimed at intimidating the Islamist group . 'We are in your cities,' the ISIS tweeter claimed, but this man, apparently a U.S. military veteran, had the perfect retort . ISIS fighters have boasted a fearlessness common in a culture that regards martyrdom as a kind of success and sees America as an enemy almost as fundamental as Israel. In one interview filmed in Syria by the cameras of VICE News, an unnamed ISIS soldier warns: 'I say to America that the Islamic Caliphate has been established. And we will not stop.' 'Don't be cowards and attack us with drones,' he says. 'Instead send your soldiers, the ones we humiliated in Iraq.' 'We will humiliate them everywhere, God willing, and we will raise the flag of Allah in the White House.'","Pic first tweeted on August 9 by an account that was later deleted .

"Wall Street banks have issued directives to ease up the workload and overbearing schedules of summer interns for fear that they are losing the best and the brightest to jobs in Silicon Valley. Many former interns said that their average workdays lasted for 13 to 14 hours, and it was not unusual to stay in the office until the early hours of the morning at least one or two days per week. In the Hong Kong office of Barclays their schedules were so demanding that many began taking naps in the toilets in order to sustain themselves. Extreme: A number of interns at Barclays Hong Kong office reported that they resorted to taking naps in the toilet stalls, putting in their earphones and setting alarms for a short while later (stock photo) Daunting: Barclays had no comment about the specific allegations of 'toilet naps' in their Hong Kong office (pictured) The so-called 'toilet naps' were reported to The Wall Street Journal with . multiple former interns telling the paper how they would go into the . toilet stalls, plug their headphones into their cell phones and set an . alarm to wake them up a short while later. Barclays wouldn't comment on those specific allegations, which stem from members of the 2011 summer intern class, but did say that they- like many top banks- are looking for ways to improve their employees' quality of life while on the job. 'We are constantly evaluating our analyst program to ensure that it is a challenging and rewarding yet balanced experience,' a spokeswoman told The Wall Street Journal. The self-reflection process started in earnest this fall after the summer death of 21-year-old Bank of America-Merrill Lynch intern Moritz Erhardt died from an epileptic fit following three-straight 'all nighters'. In turn, that bank launched a review . of their practices and has since decided that summer interns should be . granted at least four weekend days per month. JP . Morgan Chase is trying out a pilot program that grants younger bankers . one 'protected weekend' per month where they will not be called into the . office- let alone expected to respond to incessent calls and emails . during that time. Goldman . Sachs started the search this fall and the first suggestion that came . out of a task force to address the issue was the decision to lessen the . amount of weekend work across the board that they demanded of interns. Exhausted: . Moritz Erhardt was a week from completing a coveted placement at Bank . of America Merrill Lynch’s London offices when he was found dead in the . shower at his temporary accomodation . Changes: Bank of America-Merrill Lynch (left) and Goldman Sachs (right) have both announced that they are going to significantly lessen incoming interns weekend workloads . Morgan Stanley has formed a similar committee to look into the issue of how they can improve the 'quality of life' factor for their junior staffers. The Wall Street Journal reports that Morgan Stanley has not announced any blanket statements about weekends off, as the bank's chief executive James Gorman is against the idea. Mr Gorman reportedly said that by implementing such requirements could stop younger bankers from having the chance to work on high-profile assignments .","Interns at Barclays 'took naps in the toilets because they were so overworked' during their summer program .

"George Osborne is expected to abolish tax on pension payments which are passed to spouses when their partner dies, it emerged last night. Widows could receive a huge boost if the Treasury announces changes to annuities in the Autumn Statement next week. At the moment, a surviving partner pays tax on income payments which they receive from a joint life annuity. George Osborne (pictured) is expected to abolish tax on pension payments which are passed to spouses when their partner dies . This can swallow up to half of the original income their partner received before they died. But Mr Osborne is now expected to announce that these payments will be tax-free in the future if a spouse dies under the age of 75. The Chancellor has already cut death taxes for people who do not turn their pension pots into annuities – placing those who did take out an annuity at a tax disadvantage. The latest change would level the playing field for those who want the security of guaranteed income but do not want their partner to be penalised for doing so after their death. Sales of annuities have plummeted since Mr Osborne announced new pension freedoms in the Budget which meant ‘no one will have to buy an annuity’. But when he announced further changes to death duties on pension pots, it made annuities look even less favourable and alternatives more appealing. Critics said it had gone too far and now discouraged annuities, including joint life policies which ensure part of the income is passed on after death. The new changes, if announced next week, would make these kind of annuities attractive once again. Andrew Tully, of MGM Advantage (pictured) said the move would be 'fair' to annuity customers . It is understood there may be no tax to pay on the annuity payment where death occurred before the age of 75, bringing it in line with tax breaks being introduced on income drawdown schemes. For deaths after age 75, a dependant’s pension would be taxed as income, which again would bring it in line with other drawdown options. Drawdown allows customers to leave their pension fund invested while still taking an income from it, and will be available to millions more people over 55 as a result of the new pension reforms. Speaking of the anticipated changes to joint annuities, Andrew Tully, of MGM Advantage, said: ‘This would be a fair move for annuity customers and shows the Government recognises that annuities can still play an important part of a customer’s retirement strategy after April. ‘While people may well want to use the new flexibility offered, many will also want a level of certainty and security provided by an annuity to cover at least their basic needs.’ Pensions expert Tom McPhail, of Hargreaves Lansdown, said last night: ‘It is a logical harmonisation of the tax treatment. ‘A lot of the pensions industry was perplexed why the government had chosen to weight the death benefits tax away from guaranteed incomes in favour of riskier outcomes. ‘It is good that they have listened to the industry.’ Dr Ros Altmann, a pensions expert and economist, said such a change would be ‘relatively inexpensive’ for the taxpayer.","Widows could receive a huge boost if Treasury announces changes .

"With temperatures dropping and daylight hours slipping away, the chances are you have already fantasised about basking on a beach in one of the world’s most exotic locations. If so, then you are certainly not alone. A new survey revealed that during October, Britons spent almost 20 hours a week thinking about and researching their next holiday – a trend dubbed ‘travel porn’. Barbados is said to be the destinations that Britons most dream about visiting during the festive period . Price comparison website Icelolly.com studied the habits of 100 people, with each one asked to report daily on how many hours they had spent thinking about a holiday abroad over the past 24 hours. They were also quizzed on how much time they had spent actually looking up destinations on the Internet. According to the study, those looking for a morale-boosting and a way to escape the stress of the festive period spend an average of 1.7 hours a day considering their next trip. They also spent an additional 1.1 hours surfing the web to check out holiday spots. Florida was the second most popular destination, with 18 percent saying they would like to visit the US state . Dubai was named as the third-most popular winter holiday location that people long to visit during the winter . Mexico was in fourth place on the list, polling 15% of the vote . Icelolly.com also questioned a further 2,000 people over their holiday habits, with the survey also revealing that vacations were the second most popular topic of conversation between work colleagues at this time of year. The most popular conversation piece was said to be people’s plans for Christmas and New Year's Eve, while financial worries came in third place. The results are also said to be fuelled partly by coverage of exotic holidays taken by celebrities at this time of year. Thailand got 11% of the vote, putting it in fifth place in the list of most popular places for a winter break . The results of the poll are said to be partly fuelled by coverage of exotic holidays taken by celebrities such as Rihanna and Simon Cowell at this time of year . 1. Barbados – 23% . 2.

Suniel Makh, Brand Director at Icelolly.com, said: ‘Christmas is obviously a very exciting time and many of us are looking forward to spending some quality time with our family and friends. ‘However, with it also comes a fair amount of stress and it seems British people have found a new way to release the pressure, by sitting in front of their tech device for hours on end to gorge on pictures of sunny beaches. ‘Celebrities also play a big part in inspiring people by regularly inundating the social media sphere with pictures of their exotic trips, a feat Rihanna and Beyonce are often found guilty of.’","New study shows Brits spend 20 hours each week thinking about holidays .

"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a very awkward joke on Wednesday about her inability to turn down 'charismatic, attractive' men. During an on-stage interview at the Economic Club of Chicago, Clinton revealed that she rejected President Barack Obama's offer to join his cabinet  twice before saying yes. Noting that she also refused former president Bill Clinton’s hand in marriage twice before she accepted his proposal, the presumed 2016 presidential candidate said: 'I have a history with charismatic, attractive men. They just wear me out.' TMI: Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told attendees of an event at the Economic Club of Chicago last night that 'charismatic, attractive men' like President Barack Obama and her husband 'wear me out' According to the Washington Post, Clinton confessed her weakness for handsome men while in conversation with venture capitalist J.B. Pritzker, who served as national co-chairman of Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. Clinton was Illinois on Wednesday to participate in the event and campaign for Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn. The former first lady reportedly made an appearance at a private fundraiser for Quinn at a law firm while she was in town. She also accompanied him to a campaign stop at DePaul University before speaking to the Economic Club. Quinn is seeking reelection this November and is in danger of losing to Republican challenger Bruce Rauner. Today Clinton is in Philadelphia where she is scheduled to headline a rally for Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf. Wolf is hoping to oust the state's Republican governor, Tom Corbett, in next month's statewide election. Clinton, right, and Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, left, talk with supporters  as they arrive at a Barnes & Noble bookstore in Chicago on Wednesday. Clinton visited Chicago for two appearances - an interview at the Economic Club and a fundraiser for Quinn . During her dialogue with Prtizker on Wednesday night in Chicago, Clinton shifted gears to federal politics and railed on Republicans for shutting the government down last fall. The move forced her then-boss, President Obama, to cancel a previously planned trip to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Bali, Indonesia, much to her chagrin. 'I don't care what party you are, Democrats never did that to George W. Bush despite our deep differences with President Bush on taxes, on Iraq, on so many other things, Clinton said, according to CNN. 'We never did it,' the former New York Senator told the audience. Clinton went on to speculate whether members of Congress whom she believes are more interested in partisan politics than governing 'really understand the world' and 'understand what it means for the United States to lead and to be perceived as a leader.' 'Or do they just not care?' Clinton asked. 'Do they just have a whole other agenda that enables them to say whatever they want to say and spout whatever rhetoric they want to spout?' The former Democratic lawmaker said members of Congress from both parties are guilty of putting politics before problem solving but placed more of the blame on politicians 'on the other side of the aisle.' Clinton also said she finds it 'deeply distressing' that the refusal to compromise is now worn by federal lawmakers as a badge of honor. 'That is why it is imperative that you have people in business and other positions of responsibility basically say... ""Get out there and do your job. Stay off the talk shows. Get back to the Congress. Legislate and solve America's problems,"" ' she asserted.","During an on-stage interview at the Economic Club of Chicago, Clinton revealed that she rejected President Obama's offer to join his cabinet twice .
Clinton noted that she also refused former president Bill Clinton’s hand in marriage twice before she accepted his proposal .
The presumed 2016 presidential candidate then said: 'I have a history with charismatic, attractive men. They just wear me out'
Clinton also speculated whether lawmakers she disagrees with 'understand what it means for the United States to lead' and asked if they even care ."
"An eastern Pennsylvania man was charged Wednesday with fatally shooting his stepdaughter and burying the 33-year-old woman in his yard. Gregory Graf was arrested after police found Jessica Padgett's body on his property in Northampton County. Padgett, a mother and day care worker, had been missing since Friday. The motive for the slaying appears to be sexual assault, District Attorney John Morganelli said. He didn't elaborate. Police began focusing on the 53-year-old Graf after he gave inconsistent statements following Padgett's disappearance, he said.

"A cruel couple who kept 109 rabbits in squalid conditions at their home told RSPCA inspectors they were 'like alcoholics, but with pets'. Animal welfare officers found 85 hutches in the back garden of Valerie and Michael Bayley’s home in Bristol after concerned neighbours contacted the RSPCA. Two dead rabbits were discovered among the scores of underweight and malnourished animals, who were frantically scraping empty bowls for food. 'Addicted': Valerie (left) and Michael Bayley (right) who kept 109 rabbits in squalid conditions at their home told RSPCA inspectors they were 'like alcoholics, but with pets' Their hutches were covered in droppings and inspectors described the filthy conditions as living 'in squalor'. Mrs Bayley compared her addiction to alcoholism and told inspectors: 'I’m like an alcoholic, but with rabbits'. The 61-year-old and her husband, 69, both admitted five counts of animal cruelty when they appeared at Bristol Magistrates’ Court. Magistrates were told how inspectors first visited their home in the St Anne’s area of the city, in July. The charity were able to rescue the majority of the pets, but when they returned a few weeks later the couple had replaced most of the animals. Guilty pleas: The 61-year-old and her husband, 69, both admitted five counts of animal cruelty when they appeared at Bristol Magistrates’ Court . Lindi Meyer, prosecuting, told the court that on the second visit, improvements had been made to some of the hutches - but not to all of them. 'They could not move around without stepping in droppings -they had clearly not be cleaned for a very long time,' she said. 'The hutches were in sheds, which were very dark and a lack of natural light. They had significantly poor body conditions. 'The hutches were filthy - in squalor conditions.' The court heard after issuing warnings the RSPCA inspected their home again in September, only to find more than 100 rabbits being subjected to the same conditions. They had nowhere to run around and a lack of food and drink, Ms Meyer added. Graham Arnall, defending the couple, said they had been put under a lot of extra strain over the summer due to Mrs Bayley’s mother, who suffers from Alzheimer’s, being taken into hospital. He said: 'The reality is I did go on a site visit on Tuesday, I only gave them an hour’s notice so they would have had trouble cleaning all 75 hatches before I turned up. Things had obviously improved. 'Faced with the possibility of not having any rabbits at all, she decided 20 rabbits is going to be her maximum. 'She will presumably get right down [to 20] before her sentence. 'She has no previous convictions, she has never been in trouble before. She’s been keeping rabbits since she was two and this is the first time she has been in trouble.' Judge David Robinson adjourned the case until next month, so a pre-sentence report can be prepared. He said it was very likely he would disqualify the couple from keeping caged animals.","Valerie and Michael Bayley admitted five counts of animal cruelty .

"Migration Watch UK: 'These figures lay bare the legacy of the Labour government' Number of Poles living in the UK has risen from 75,000 in 2003 to 532,000 at the end of last year . Migration added 239,000 to Britain’s population last year – because immigration remained sky-high while Britons can no longer afford to leave the country to live abroad. The figure is more than a fifth higher than in 2009 and the second biggest annual total ever. The increase came despite Coalition promises to curb immigration. The number of immigrants – 575,000 last year – has run at a similar level for the past seven years. Soaring figures: The number of people migrating to the UK increased by 20 per cent last year . Fewer Britons are emigrating because falling incomes and pensions mean hundreds of thousands have abandoned the dream of retirement or a new life in France, Spain, Australia or the U.S. The recession has also reduced the number of Britons able to take jobs elsewhere in the world. Emigration fell by more than a fifth in two years after the recession began in 2008. The figures also showed that Polish and other Eastern European workers are no longer heading home because of the impact of the recession but are now coming back to Britain in large numbers. Last year 71,000 people from Poland and other Eastern European countries came to Britain, up from 52,000 the year before. Only 31,000 Eastern Europeans emigrated from Britain compared with 47,000 in 2009. The figures released yesterday by the Office for National Statistics reignited the political row over migration. Let down: Home Secretary Theresa May will be disappointed to hear that the net migration figures have jumped . Labour accused ministers of dishonesty over the pledges to reduce the impact of immigration on the population, while the Government said net migration – the numbers added to the population by migration – had begun to level off after the unprecedented mass migration of Labour’s years in power. The new estimates mean the day when the country’s population hits 70million, the symbolic figure which a Labour minister once declared would never be reached, has come even closer. At this rate a 70million population will be reached in 2025 – four years earlier than the officially-projected date of 2029. The Coalition has introduced schemes to cut the number of work permits given to migrants from outside Europe and drawn up a scheme to reduce numbers of foreign students. Immigration minister Damian Green said yesterday: ‘In various sectors, this country has become addicted to immigration, and, like weaning anyone off an addiction, it requires time, it requires patience and perseverance. ‘We need a better balanced immigration system and we need lower immigration. We also need a better-skilled workforce.’ Mr Green said the Government would not lower its targets for slashing immigration levels. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, he said: ‘It’s very important we get immigration at a sustainable level, not just for our economy but for the wider health of society. ‘If people have confidence in the immigration system, then some of the social stresses and strains we have seen in recent years go away.’ The 239,000 figure has been surpassed only once – in 2004, the year Britain’s doors were opened to workers from Poland and Eastern Europe under EU rules, when net migration reached 245,000. Sir Andrew Green, of the MigrationWatch think-tank, said: ‘These figures lay bare the legacy of the Labour government.’ Matt Cavanagh, associate director of . the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) think tank, slammed the figures, . saying: 'Politicians shouldn't promise what they can't deliver, . particularly on immigration. 'Before . the election, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats said immigration was . out of control; afterwards, they said they would cut it dramatically. Neither was true. 'Today's . figures reinforce how stable immigration has been both before and after . the election: the ONS estimate non-British immigration for 2010 at . 455,000, compared to 437,000 in 2009 - and broadly stable since 2006. 'Emigration . has continued to fall, down over 20 per cent since 2008, meaning that . ""net inward migration"", the Conservatives' chosen target, remains high . at 239,000, a 21 per cent increase on 2009.' The number of Polish people living in the UK has risen from 75,000 in 2003 to 532,000 at the end of last year, other ONS figures released today showed. Net migration from the so-called A8 countries which are eight of the ten countries that joined the European Union in 2004, - the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - rose almost eight-fold last year to 39,000 from 5,000 in 2009, the ONS figures showed. Around two in three of all A8 citizens who have migrated to the UK have been Polish, the figures showed. The figures also showed the number of Poles working in the UK between April and June this year reached 449,888, up 15 per cent from January to March. More than four in five Poles aged 16 to 64 were employed, compared with just seven in 10 of the UK population as a whole, during the second quarter of 2011. Other ONS figures showed births to mothers born outside the UK accounted for one in four of all live births in the UK last year. Poland became the most common country of origin for non-UK born mothers, while for fathers it was Pakistan. The figures released today also . showed the number of people granted settlement - known as 'indefinite . leave to remain' and requires a good knowledge of language and life in . the UK - reached a record 241,000 last year. This number included those already living in the country, as well as those applying in the last year. Settlement is decided on a case by . case basis, depending on a variety of factors including the applicant's . employment status, whether they are refugees or if they already have . family living the UK. The high settlement figure was partly attributed to the number . of people being allowed to stay as the backlog of asylum cases was . cleared, other figures published by the Home Office showed. Long-term immigration was 575,000, . similar to the levels seen since 2004, while long-term emigration fell . to 336,000 from 427,000 in 2008, estimates from the Office for National . Statistics (ONS) showed. Study remained the most common reason . for those coming to the UK, with three in four of the 228,000 overseas . students who come to the UK to learn coming from outside the EU. But the number of people heading to the UK's shores for a definite job was at its lowest in more than six years, at 110,000. And . the amount of those leaving the UK for work-related reasons was at its . lowest for three years at 179,000, the ONS estimates showed. Work-related . grants of settlement also reached a record last year of 84,000, . reflecting high numbers admitted for work five years earlier. But figures for the first half of this year showed an 8 per cent fall in the number of people being granted settlement, down to 208,000, with falls in both the work and family categories. A total of 195,000 people were granted British citizenship last year, down from the record high of 204,000 in 2009 but more than double the level of a decade earlier. The number of people applying for asylum also fell in 2010, but has started to rise again this year with 4,800 applications between April and June. This is up 9 per cent from the same quarter in 2010, mainly due to an increase in applications from war-torn Pakistan and Libya, the figures showed. The number of people being removed or leaving the UK voluntarily fell to a record low between April and June this year, the Home Office figures showed. Just 11,388 people were removed or left voluntarily, the lowest quarterly figure since such data became available in 2001. It came as an audit showed the huge costs the last government spent on asylum claims. Labour spent £2million every day on a shambolic asylum system which failed to remove hundreds of thousands of bogus claimants, revealed a study by the MigrationWatch think-tank. The audit showed how officials spent as much as £10billion processing applications as they struggled to cope with a surge in numbers. But only one in four of the 660,000 decisions made on asylum claims between 1997 and 2010 led to the applicant being removed.","Migration Watch UK: 'These figures lay bare the legacy of the Labour government'

"Top female advisers felt left out by a boy's club in the White House where rampant infighting sabotaged the administration's economic decisions, according to a controversial new book. Sidelined and ignored in the West Wing, some women aides reportedly complained to President Obama about their treatment in 2009. In an excerpt obtained by the Washington Post, a female senior aide is quoted as calling the White House a hostile environment for women. A new book alleges the White House can be a hostile environment for women to work in. President Obama, who goes home to a wife, two daughters and a mother-in-law at night, is not personally cited for any mistreatment . Confidence Men: Wall Steet, Washington and the Education of a President, by journalist Ron Suskind, is due out in the shops next Tuesday. Former Communications Director Anita Dunn calls the work environment 'hostile' in the book, which she now denies having said . According to the Post, former White House Communications Director Anita Dunn says in the book: 'This place would be in court for a hostile workplace because it actually fit all of the classic legal requirements for a genuinely hostile workplace to women.' Dunn denied to the Post that she made the remark, adding: 'The president is someone who when he goes home at night he goes home to a house full of very strong women. He values having strong women around him.' But Suskind's book insists many women felt outmaneuvered by male colleagues such as former Chief-of-Staff Rahm Emanuel and, Larry Summers, former chairman of the National Economic Council. 'I felt like a piece of meat,' Christina . Romer, former head of the Council of Economic Advisers, said of one . meeting with Summers. The Post said Dunn raised the issue during the 2008 campaign when a TV ad was prepared without featuring a single woman. In the book Larry Summers and Rahm Emanuel, now Mayor of Chicago, are cited as making women unhappy and feel outmaneuvered . 'I was dumbfounded. It wasn't like they were being deliberately sexist. It's just there was no-one offering a female perspective.' The book also details internal squabbles between Obama's economic team, including Timothy Geithner . 'The president has a real woman problem. The idea of the boy's club being just Larry and Rahm isn't really fair. He (Obama) was just as responsible himself,' an unnamed high-ranking . woman official told the author. The book also reportedly details internal squabbling between Obama's economic team, among them Summers and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. Based on interviews with more than 200 people, the book is being published at a sensitive time for Obama, who is facing the lowest public approval figures of his tenure. However, in an interview today with the Post, Dunn takes issue with Suskind's depiction of the White House. 'It's a place where there is vigorous discussion back and forth. At various times people have issues with their colleagues, but we were united. I've been very clear that this is a president who values a diverse set of voices on every issue,' she said.","Allegations in Confidence Men: Wall Steet, Washington .

"A coroner burst into tears after hearing how a Special Forces officer was shot dead during a botched raid on a Taliban compound. He said that Captain Richard Holloway’s parents should be proud of their son who ‘died with a rifle in his hand doing a job that he loved and protecting freedom’. An inquest into the officer’s death two days before Christmas Day last year heard dramatic details about the night-time ambush of the Taliban stronghold in Afghanistan. The Special Boat Service solider was hit by two Kalashnikov bullets fired by a waiting enemy soldier as the elite team approached the compound. Coroner Andrew Tweddle (left) broke down in tears after hearing how Captain Richard Holloway (right) died just before Christmas last year in a night-time ambush of the Taliban stronghold as he served in Afghanistan . Capt Holloway’s commanding officer rushed to help his colleague as gunmen continued to spray bullets in their direction. He lifted the 29-year-old and carried him down the mountain on his back, but his valiant efforts were in vain as Capt Holloway was already dead. Coroner Andrew Tweddle broke down in tears later in the inquest as he  recalled the death of his own son in a car crash. Addressing Capt Holloway’s parents Neil and Jacquie the coroner said: ‘He died with a rifle in his hand, doing a job he loved and protecting freedom. I have difficulty saying this. ‘My son died some years ago in a car crash. If someone had said to me what that officer had said, I would feel very proud.’ A Belgian Malinois dog called DaGarwal (above) belonging to the force, which was wearing a vest with a camera and torch attached, was also seized by the Taliban in the botched raid after getting lost in the melee . Mr Tweddle concluded that Capt Holloway died from gunshot wounds sustained while on active operational duty in Afghanistan. Capt Holloway’s family, from Hamsterley, Durham, were also reduced to tears at the conclusion of the hearing. The disastrous raid, in which the team was reportedly targeting a Taliban commander, has previously been described as an ‘embarrassing failure’. As well as capturing an array of specialist equipment, including assault rifles, grenades and a night vision camera, the insurgents also injured another soldier. A Belgian Malinois dog belonging to the force, which was wearing a vest with a camera and torch attached, was also seized after getting lost in the melee. 'Embarrassing failure': Troops travelled to the compound, located outside Kabul, on Chinook helicopters but were immediately ambushed by a large group of opposition fighters (file picture) The animal - named DaGarwal, the Pashto for Colonel - became an unlikely prisoner of war when it was paraded as a trophy by bearded gunmen following the attack. The raid was carried out by a Special Forces unit called Task Force 42, which includes members of the SBS and SAS. Troops travelled to the compound, located outside Kabul, on Chinook helicopters but were immediately ambushed by a large group of opposition fighters. As the intense firefight broke out, Capt Holloway was hit in the thigh and pelvis, before the soldiers eventually retreated. His commanding officer, who was referred to during the inquest in Crook, County Durham, as Officer C described carrying him off the mountain. Giving evidence from behind a screen, he said: ‘Rich died with a rifle in his hand, he died doing the job that he absolutely loved and he died protecting the freedoms the Afghan people enjoyed, like the people in the UK.’ Before joining the Special Forces, the soldier was part of the Royal Engineers. Paying tribute after his death, his parents, brother Luke and girlfriend Sandy described him as a ‘perfectionist’ and ‘exceptional young man’. They said: ‘He was a dedicated and totally committed member of the armed forces, relishing the excitement and challenge but always serious and reflective about his duties and responsibilities to those with whom he served. ‘Wherever the action was, he wanted to be part of it - and that is where our beloved son, of whom we are so very proud, lost his life.’ His commanding officer, who was not named, also called him a ‘natural leader’ who was ‘revered by the Afghans whom he mentored tirelessly’ after the incident. During the inquest in Crook, County Durham (pictured), coroner Andrew Tweddle broke down in tears and told Capt Holloway's parents that they should be very proud of their son who died serving in Afghanistan . He added: ‘His tactical ability commanded wide respect; his judgment was un-erring, his enthusiasm was infectious and his standards never dropped. Former Defence Secretary Philip Hammond also said at the time: 'It is clear from the tributes that have been paid to him that he was an officer who set the highest of standards and was liked and respected in equal measure by his colleagues and commanders. 'His great contribution and, indeed, his sacrifice will not be forgotten. 'My thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Captain Holloway’s family, friends and colleagues at this most difficult time.' Hundreds of mourners lined the streets of Durham in silence to pay their respects at Captain Holloway's funeral, which was held at the city's cathedral in January. At the start of the inquest Mr Tweddle said the Ministry of Defence had made an application to him for Officer C’s evidence to be made from behind a screen so he could not be identified, having regard to ‘the operational effectiveness of the UK Special Forces’.","Captain Richard Holloway, 29, died two days before Christmas last year .

"A giant sunspot on the solar surface has erupted for the sixth time in a week. It is the third major flare in the last 48 hours, from the  sunspot which is 14 times larger than Earth and almost as big as Jupiter. Nasa said the activity confirms the areas as the  largest active region seen on the sun in 24 years. Scroll down for video . The bright light in the lower right of the sun shows an X-class solar flare on Oct. 26, 2014, as captured by NASA's SDO. This was the third X-class flare in 48 hours, which erupted from the largest active region seen on the sun in 24 years. Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies. A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced. Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents. 'A giant active region on the sun erupted on Oct. 26, 2014, with its sixth substantial flare since Oct. 19,' Nasa said. 'This flare was classified as an X2-class flare and it peaked at 6:56 a.m. EDT. 'This is the third X-class flare in 48 hours, erupting from the largest active region seen on the sun in 24 years. Previous monster storms on the sun's surface have unleashed a solar flare in the direction of Earth - and there could be more to come. 'It would seem to be just a matter of time before another strong explosion occurs,' said Spaceweather.com's Tony Phillips . Space Weather Prediction Center forecaster Christopher Balch, meanwhile, said the flare affected radio that uses part of the upper atmosphere. That includes some but not all radar and plane systems as well as amateur radio. Mr Balch said the storm briefly was rated as strong for affecting Earth radio systems but then dropped to minor levels. One event event temporarily blacked out a few radio communication systems before weakening. An X-class flare erupted from the sun on Oct. 25, 2014, as seen as a bright flash of light in this image from NASA's SDO. The image shows extreme ultraviolet light in the 131-angstrom wavelength, which highlights the intensely hot material in a flare and which is typically colorized in teal. The event followed months of near-silent activity on the sun before the huge flare erupted from a sunspot 14 times bigger than Earth. A spokesperson for the Met Office Space Weather Operations Centre told MailOnline it may be the biggest sunspot for 25 years. An X1.6 class flare erupted from the lower half of the sun today, as seen in the bright flash of light in this image from Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). This image shows extreme ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 131 Angstroms, which highlights the intense heat of a solar flare . But they said in the UK there had been 'no reports of any disruption at all. There may have been short periods of outage in radio communication but nothing has been repotred as causing problems.' Flares are massive explosions on the Sun associated with sunspots. Magnetic fields in sunspots can store vast amounts of energy, but looping magnetic field lines can get tangled up and snap, releasing their energy as explosions called flares. Sunspot AR12192 is 14 times larger than Earth and almost as big as Jupiter. The Met Office told MailOnline it might be the largest sunspot in 25 years. It is so big that it can be seen in images of the sun from Earth's surface (shown in this image from pilot Brian Whittaker) The light area in the centre of this image is the largest sunspot in this 11-year solar cycle, says the Met Office, and it may also have been the largest sunspot for 25 years . Yesterday's flare was an X1.6, which is a million times the combined yield of every single nuclear weapon on Earth. 'The sun erupted with another significant flare today, peaking at 10:28 a.m. EDT on Oct. 22, 2014,' revealed Nasa. 'Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory captured images of the event, which occurred in the lower half of the sun. 'This flare is classified as an X1.6 class flare. 'X-class flares denote the most extreme flares. 'This is the third substantial flare from the same region of the sun since Oct. 19.' Dr Young of Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center added: ‘It continues to grow in size and complexity.' The sunspot group - Active Region 2192 - has doubled in size to become one of the biggest groups in years, and has been described by astronomy experts as ‘menacing’. Up close: Monster Sunspot AR12192 taken by Karzaman Ahmad on October 21, 2014 from Langkawi Nagtional Observatory, Malaysia . Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Nasa says, ‘Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth’s atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground, but when intense enough - they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.’ An SDO/HMI view of the visible sun showing the largest sunspot of solar cycle 24, AR12192 - which is approaching the size of Earth. According to experts at thesuntoday.org, 'As of Oct. 22, 2014 (11 UT) the region’s trailing spots have an area of 2410 MH or millionths of a visible solar hemisphere. 'The largest up until now had been AR11967 on Feb. 5, 2014, measuring 1580 MH. MH is a standard measure used by astronomers for area. 'Just to provide some scale, the surface area of Earth is 169 MH - this means that AR12192 is 14 times larger than the surface area of Earth.' According to Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) team a single, dynamic active region unleashed over half a dozen solar flares in about 24 hours from 25 to 26 August. The two larger flares were M-class (moderate) flares and the others were smaller flares.

"British Olympic hopeful Zoe Smith said she had been subjected to a barrage of abuse since featuring in a BBC documentary . A teenage weightlifter representing Britain at the Olympics has been targeted by ‘ignorant’ internet trolls who said she looked like a ‘bloke’ and a ‘lesbian’. Zoe Smith said she had been subjected to a barrage of abuse since featuring in a BBC documentary. The 18-year-old athlete – who has a boyfriend – has responded by writing a blog about the ‘close-minded, ignorant chauvinistic twerps’ who criticised her physique. Miss Smith said she and her fellow weightlifters ‘don’t lift weights in order to look hot’ for men and ‘couldn’t give a toss’ if it made them more attractive. She wrote: ‘Most of the people that do think like this seem to be chauvinistic, pig-headed blokes who feel emasculated by the fact that we are stronger than them. Simple as that.’ She added that it was particularly ‘sad’ to see abuse from girls who labelled her ‘weird’ for her muscular physique. ‘You’d think that young women around the same age as us would commend us,’ she added. ‘But apparently we’re “weird” for not constantly eating c**p, binge drinking regularly and wearing the shortest, tightest dresses that the high street has to offer.’ After the programme about the Team GB weightlifters – entitled ‘Girl Power: Going For Gold’ – was aired on BBC3, Miss Smith received a string of abusive comments on Twitter. One wrote of Miss Smith and her fellow weightlifters: ‘You wouldn’t marry any of them they’re probably lesbians anyway.’ When Miss Smith replied that she wouldn’t marry him either, he wrote: ‘I wouldn’t even look at you I’d think you was a bloke and so would 9 out 10 lads,’ before adding; ‘p*** off back to the kitchen and make your boyfriend a sandwich he’s hungry.’ Reporting the exchange on her blog, Miss Smith wrote: ‘To think people still think like this is laughable. We’re in 2012!’ Well wishers: Miss Smith has been deluged with messages of support for standing up to the bullies . Since then Miss Smith has been deluged with messages of support for standing up to the bullies. Her manager, Gab Stone, said he was ‘immensely proud’ of the way she had responded. ‘She is such a level-headed girl that it is sometimes hard to believe she is only 18,’ he said. ‘This sort of abuse is something we take really seriously and I think some other athletes her age would be really affected by it. ‘But I think the way she has responded is absolutely brilliant. ‘Zoe is absolutely not the stereotype weightlifter – as well as being very talented and hardworking she’s a very pretty girl and incredibly intelligent.’ Comeback: Miss Smith said she and her fellow weightlifters 'don't lift . weights in order to look hot' for men and 'couldn't give a toss' if it . made them more attractive . The teenager, from Greenwich in South London, is due to arrive in the athletes’ village tomorrow and is competing in the 58kg weight category on Monday. A British Olympic Authority spokesman said it would not hesitate to call in the police over online threats to athletes. ‘The BOA does not condone abusive behaviour and would not hesitate to involve appropriate law enforcement agencies.’","Zoe Smith, 18, hit back in a blog about 'close-minded, ignorant chauvinistic twerps'"
"She grabbed global headlines worldwide for reporting in her bikini at the G20 and now, she's about to stir another viral storm after her latest video release wrapping up the summit. As world leaders sweltered in their suits during the G20, Susanne Ward, 27, turned up the heat when she interviewed protesters during People's March at Musgrave Park in South Brisbane. The  video, titled 'G20 Hot Exposure', the 27-year-old is seen speaking to a shocked female protester after  the Gold Coast model approached her for online news channel 'Aussie Beach TV'. Scroll down for video . In the latest video, the bikini reporter interviews an offended protester (right) who is shocked at the lack of clothing . Susanne Ward, also known as Janaya, interviewed people at the G20 while she wore a bikini for Aussie Beach TV.  Here she is pictured with another character from Aussie Beach TV, bogan 'Jack Russel' 'That's incredibly misogynistic and sexist and it's an absolute reflection of the G20's patriotic b******t that is destroying the planet,' the woman told Aussie Beach TV. 'And to put this beautiful and intelligent woman in a bikini for ratings is f*** up!' before she stormed off the camera. The video was posted onto YouTube on Tuesday, along with the caption: 'WARNING; Course language. Janaya and the Aussie Beach TV crew travelled to Brisbane recently to attend the G20 People's March and Summit at Musgrave Park, West End. 'We asked the citizens why they were at the march and a few more important questions.' Ms Ward was a model (left) when she was approached to report for Aussie Beach TV during the G20 . Ms Ward's unique reporting style on the streets of Brisbane during the G20 made international headlines . Ms Ward, who goes by the stage name Janaya, told Daily Mail Australia that she had no qualms about flaunting her body to bring attention to politics. ‘I’m a bikini model so I didn’t feel uncomfortable about doing the interview in my bikini. ‘Anyway, I’m happy with what I’ve got going on,’ she says with a laugh. ‘With the forty degree heat, being in a bikini was the best way to do it!’ But Ms Ward, who goes by the stage name Janaya, is serious about telling people’s stories and giving them a voice about important social issues. ‘A lot of people have a lot to say but none of the normal people get heard,’ she said. ‘But they should be heard because the world is our world.’ Aussie Beach TV spoke to people on the streets in the hope they could give everyday Australians a platform so their opinions would be heard . During the G20, Ms Ward spoke to different protesters about issues including globalisation, indigenous rights and the legalisation of marijuana . During the G20, Ms Ward spoke to different protesters about issues including globalisation, indigenous rights and the legalisation of marijuana. However she insists her preparation for the weekened only involved ‘buying another bikini’. She says she learnt so much from interviewing everyday people in the street. ‘I never knew about things like how the government is only saying what they want us to know,’ Ms Ward told Daily Mail Australia. ‘Everyone was really smart, people blew me out of the water.' Aussie Beach TV hires attractive women to report in their bikinis, in the hope that their stunning appearance will make ‘everyday Australians’ pay attention to the issues that matter. ‘Aussie Beach TV is based on getting the girls in bikinis to do interviews with people because it will actually get people interested and watching,’ Ms Ward said. The mastermind behind the idea, Markus Forest, says ‘only five to ten per cent of viewers out there said that Janaya should put some clothes on’ The mastermind behind the idea, Markus Forest, says ‘only five to ten per cent of viewers out there said that Janaya should put some clothes on’. During the G20, the Aussie Beach TV news crew encountered an irate woman who was offended by Ms Ward’s lack of clothing. ‘One person didn’t like what we were doing, she yelled and swore at the camera,’ said Mr Forest. ‘She asking why we were exploiting a beautiful and intelligent young woman by getting her to degrade herself.’ Mr Forest says that the angered woman's passion is exactly what the news site is all about. ‘We stick up for her right to say that; her free speech and freedom of expression,' he said. ‘So we’re going to put her fight to air because it’s a ripper!’ Janaya learnt a lot from interviewing the protesters at the G20, explaining ‘I never knew about things like how the government is only saying what they want us to know' Janaya is serious about telling people’s stories and giving them a voice about important social issues .

Mr Forest also plays a character in the series named ‘Jack Russel’, an eccentric bogan with a fake mullet and an ocker accent. Mr Forest hopes that his unique approach will appeal to ‘the average Aussie’. He believes his bikini reporters will captivate the audience in a unique way, so everyday Australians will learn about alternative views that do not normally receive media coverage. ‘We want to show all the news that you should have noticed but you were probably distracted, or the stories or opinions that you don’t hear on the news.’ ‘We want to make it fun and more popular to talk about the important stuff.’ ‘Big TV news crews came up to us and said “you have the best job”’ Ms Ward was relieved she was in a bikini because it was the only way to survive the heat.

"A perfect day for Manchester City and a perfect way to prepare for the biggest night of their season so far. Chelsea dropped points, Manchester United lost and Manuel Pellegrini’s team scored five in one of the most startlingly one-sided games of the Barclays Premier League season. Newcastle were lamentable. That should not be overlooked. City, though, were terrific and they will now head in to Tuesday’s Champions League game at home to Barcelona imbued with confidence after scoring nine times in their last two league games. Sergio Aguero scored a second-minute penalty to give Manchester City the lead against Newcastle United at the Etihad Stadium . Samir Nasri celebrates with his tongue stuck out after doubling City's lead and effectively ending the game after 12 minutes . Edin Dzeko, starting ahead of new signing Wilfried Bony, made it 3-0 in the first half and here is congratulated by his team-mates . David Silva offers a wave to the crowd after scoring City's fourth before adding a fifth moments later with a brilliant driven effort . Manchester City (4-4-2): Hart 7; Zabaleta 7, Kompany 8, Mangala 6, Kolarov 6; Nasri 8 (Lampard 70 mins, 7), Fernandinho 7, Toure 6, Silva 8 (Navas 59, 7); Dzeko 9, Aguero 8 (Bony 60, 7). Subs not used: Fernando, Demichelis, Clichy, Caballero. Booked: Kompany, Toure, Dzeko. Manager: Manuel Pellegrini . Newcastle United (4-3-3): Krul 6; Janmaat 6 (Taylor 71, 5), Williamson 5, Coloccini 4, Haidara 6; Sissoko 4, Anita 4 (Abeid 46, 6), Colback 5; Gouffran 4 (Obertan 86), Cisse 5, Perez 6. Subs not used: Ameobi, Armstrong,  Riviere, Woodman. Booked: Anita, Colback. Manager: John Carver . Referee: Chris Foy . Man of the match:Edin Dzeko . Attendance: 45,602. David Silva (21) played a key role in Samir Nasri's goal to put City 2-0 up at the Etihad. Click here for more MATCH ZONE . City have been here before, of course. This time last year they prepared for a game against the Catalan club by beating Chelsea. Three days later they got a right old chasing. This felt different to that, though. This game had the feeling of a team moving through the gears ahead of greater challenges to come. As odd as it sounds, the English champions won this game with something in reserve. A penalty in the second minute from Sergio Aguero was certainly the perfect start for City. After that they found a way through what can generously be called the Newcastle defence with ease. Samir Nasri and Edin Dzeko contributed quite exquisite goals before half-time and two David Silva goals early in the second period had Newcastle hanging on for full-time with well over half an hour remaining. A Manchester City sign holds up a sign to welcome January signing  Bony to the club ahead of the game against Newcastle . Aguero calmly placed his spot-kick past Tim Krul who barely moved as the Argentine converted in the second minute . Aguero celebrates after giving Manchester City an early lead at the Etihad Stadium following Anita's foul on Dzeko . Nasri waltzed through the Newcastle penalty area before putting his shot high into Krul's net to make it 2-0 to Manchester City . In the Premier League, Chelsea’s advantage is now five points. In Spain, meanwhile, they will know that Barcelona have just lost for the first time in twelve games at exactly the wrong time. Newcastle actually won here in the Capital One Cup at the end of October but their Premier League record in Manchester – and particular against City – is awful. Having lost their two previous league games at the Etihad Stadium 4-0 and not having win at City since September 2000 this always had the look of a troublesome afternoon for John Carver and his players. It never helps, of course, when you concede a penalty within 27 seconds. Newcastle began the game trying to play the ball rather ambitiously out from the edge of their own penalty area and when Vurnon Anita’s first touch played him into trouble under pressure from Edin Dzeko, his second brought the Bosnian centre forward crashing to earth. Replays showed the contact between the players to be minimal but there was some nevertheless. Aguero stepped forward to side foot the resulting penalty past Tim Krul with a certain amount of ease. Motivated no doubt by news of Chelsea’s late implosion against Burnley and facing such compliant opposition, City looked set fair as soon as Aguero’s penalty found the net. Newcastle briefly threatened to respond as Daryl Janmaat’s long distance shot flew inches wide of Joe Hart’s right-hand post but it turned out to an isolated foray forward during a first half that City decorated with some lovely football. Fabricio Coloccini and Anita watch on as Nasri doubles the lead in the 12th minute at the Etihad Stadium in Saturday's late kick off . Krul was grounded and Nasri simply placed the ball above the Dutch keeper for City's second goal at the Etihad Stadium . Nasri wheels away after making sure this game did not go the same way as Newcastle's 2-0 win at the Etihad in the Capital One Cup . Krul was again beaten, this time by Dzeko for the third goal after he converted from Silva's lofted through ball over the defence . The Bosnian forward was thought to be slipping down the pecking order with Bony's arrival but his goal will have helped his position . In the 13th minute Pellegrini’s team scored again. A goal that pretty much sealed the result, it was a super one to watch, too. Dzeko, pleased no doubt to be selected ahead of new signing Wilfried Bony, crossed low from the left towards Aguero but when the ball was deflected in to Nasri’s path, the French international beat one Newcastle defender with a perfect first touch, another with a drop of the shoulder and then side-footed the ball high to Krul’s right with his left instep. Ultimately, the actual finish proved to be the easy bit. So perfect had been Nasri’s control, composure and clarity of thinking that by the time he came to pick his spot the goal had become an inevitably. So too, now, had become the result. Newcastle looked utterly lost. On the touchline Carver and assistant Steve Stone talked the problem through at length. When you are two down within quarter of an hour at the champions, however, there often isn’t an answer. Captain Vincent Kompany puts and arm around the goalscorer as City run riot in the first half before adding more goals after the break . Newcastle's players endured a torrid first half, as shown by the expressions of Anita, Mike Williamson and Jack Colback (L-R) Aguero breaks away from Moussa Sissoko (right) while Massadio Haidara also tries to keep tabs on the explosive striker . The game didn't exactly go the way that Newcastle's manager until the end of the season, John Carver, would have wanted . A black Manchester City fan holds up a sign in support of the victim of the racist attack by Chelsea fans on the Paris Metro this week . City – facing a goal difference as well as a points deficit behind Chelsea – sensed opportunity. A dummy from Pablo Zabaleta allowed Aguero to screw a shot across goal and wide while Dzeko – full of eager running – fizzed a shot from distance over the bar. Dzeko soon got his goal, though, and once again it was fantastic to watch. Silva’s driven pass from deep dropped over Fabricio Coloccini’s head on to Dzeko’s chest 12 yards out and he waited before striking it home on the half-volley with his left instep. City’s supporters have seen some terrific football since Arab money transformed their club in 2008 but this 45 minutes was up there with the best. There was still time for Dzeko to head wide from a corner before the interval while they could even have had a couple more penalties. Not that any of that really mattered for long. Within eight minutes of the second half starting, City had two more goals. Silva finishes low into the corner to recommence the goalscoring after the half-time break and move City four goals clear in the game . Silva celebrates with Aguero after making it 4-0 at the Etihad Stadium as the goals continued to pile on top of Newcastle keeper Krul . Silva went on to blast in the fifth goal with the pick of the strikes from outside the area on Saturday afternoon at City's Etihad Stadium . Once again the football was great to watch but it was impossible to ignore Newcastle’s compliance. In the run up to Silva’s first goal in the 47th minute, Aguero was allowed to run diagonally from almost inside his own half to the edge of the penalty box without anyone making a tackle. When he laid the ball off to Nasri and the ball then found Silva, there was only going to be one outcome. There was a similar sense of inevitability soon after, too. This time Yaya Toure’s diagonal pass found Aguero and when he controlled it Silva arrived to drive his second goal – his team’s fifth – across Krul from 18 yards. With more than half an hour left, it seemed as though City would score as many as they wished. Bony made his entrance at this stage, too, and he was denied a debut goal in the 76th minute by the legs of the Newcastle goalkeeper. Remarkably, there were to be no more goals. City can only hope they have saved some for Tuesday. Silva celebrates scoring City's fifth while Newcastle's Yoann Gouffran heads back to the half-way line in frustration .

"They took to the pitch to keep football fans' spirits high while Britain's men were off at war. But there was one team that stood tall above the rest. Thousands of female munition factory workers began playing the beautiful game during World War One, but the Blyth Spartans Munitionettes from Northumberland played more beautifully than all the others. Taught to play by naval ratings on a local beach, the Blyth Spartans remained unbeaten throughout their two-year existence. Stars: The Blyth Spartans team of 1918, including Bella Raey who scored a hat-trick in the Munitionettes Cup . Star player: The Blyth Spartans top player was coalminer's daughter, Bella Raey . Their star centre-forward was Bella Raey, the daughter of a local coal miner, who scored 133 goals in one season, and even went on to play for England. The highlight of the female football calendar was a knock-out tournament called the Munitionettes Cup, held in 1918, which attracted 30 teams. The Blyth Spartans were the eventual winners, beating Bolckow-Vaughan of Middlesbrough at Ayresome Park in front of a crowd of 22,000. Bella Reay scored a hat-trick. But despite the women being almost as popular on the pitch as the men had been before the war, when the boys returned home, the munition factories closed and the teams disbanded. Several women tried to continue to play, but in 1921, the FA banned women's football at their grounds - bringing to an end a colourful chapter in women's sport which has long been overlooked. Now the story of the Blyth Spartans Munitionettes has been brought to life in a radio documentary for BBC Newcastle as part of a new series that explores the tales of the British women who kept the UK moving during World War One. The UK-wide project, World War One At Home, will tell more than 1400 powerful, fascinating and moving stories over the coming year across local, regional and national radio, television and online.

"Killed: College student Jamil Palmer, 18, died after he was stabbed in the heart in a London park . Four teenage boys and a girl murdered an 18-year-old student after footage of him knocking one of them out was shared on Snapchat, a court heard. Jamil Palmer died of a stab wound to the heart after an altercation in a park in Feltham, west London, on May 6 this year. Yesterday a court heard he had 'humiliated' a 17-year-old rival by knocking him unconscious just hours before the fatal stabbing - while a friend filmed on a mobile phone. The footage was shared on the mobile app Snapchat, which allows users to 'broadcast' brief video clips to hundreds of friends at once. Following the fight - which happened outside a youth court where both teenagers appeared over a separate incident - Mr Palmer is said to have challenged his rival to a one-on-one follow-up. He invited the 17-year-old to meet him in Crane Park, Hounslow, later that day. But Snaresbrook Crown Court was told the 17-year-old brought along three other boys aged 18, 16 and 15 - along with a 16-year-old girl - who all murdered Mr Palmer. The jury heard CCTV footage showed the four boys and the girl arriving at the park. Minutes later Mr Palmer suffered three stab wounds and was found slumped near the entrance to a cul-de-sac. The Kingston College student from Hampton, Middlesex, was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. The court heard Mr Palmer and his rival were outside Feltham Youth Court when the initial fight took place. They were there because they had been charged with affray following an incident outside the Hounslow Youth Offenders Team office on February 25. The 17-year-old rival has declined to give evidence in his defence, as has 18-year-old Kishon Zelaya, who is the only defendant old enough to be named. But the 15-year-old, of Wembley, north west London, took the stand in his defence yesterday. He told the jury he and the other four teenagers had laughed at the Snapchat video, but the 17-year-old was complaining he had been hit from behind. Showdown: Mr Palmer was said to have invited his rival to a 'one-on-one' in Crane Park, Hounslow (pictured) -- but the 17-year-old brought three boys aged 18, 16 and 15 along with a 16-year-old girl. All deny murder . John McGuiness QC, prosecuting, asked the 15-year-old: ‘Did you understand from that, that Jamil had won the fight? Was [the defendant] saying it wasn’t a fair fight because Jamil had hit him from behind?’ He replied: ‘He said he got hit from behind.’ Mr McGuiness said: ‘Was he angry that it hadn’t been a fair fight?’ Did he tell you why he wanted you to come with him?' The defendant replied: ‘No’. Mr McGuiness asked: ‘Did he feel a bit humiliated? Because this was filmed on a phone this suggests that someone had been standing over him at the time of the fight and taking a video of him - what this shows is that they had had a fight and Jamil had knocked him out. ‘What did you think when you saw the video? Did you think the defendant was going to get the best of Jamil? 'They’d had a fight and Jamil had knocked him out, and now Jamil wanted another fight didn’t he? So how is he going to get the best of Jamil?' But the 15-year-old insisted there had been no mention of knives or weapons. Zelaya, of Reading, and the other four defendants of Hounslow, West London, and Wembley, north London, all deny murder and an alternative charge of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Jamil Palmer 'had knocked out 17-year-old rival in Feltham, west London'

"A fugitive Mafia boss was arrested by Italian police after he was found at the end of a secret tunnel accessed through a fake fridge. Valentino Gionta jnr, was running the Camorra Clan in Naples at the time of his arrest in a dawn raid. According to Italian police, Gionta had been running the Mafia family since his father's arrest in 2012. Italian police arrested suspected Mafia boss Valentino Gionta Jnr, centre, after a dawn raid in Naples, Italy . Put him in the cooler! Police investigate the elaborate secret tunnel dug out underneath the fridge . Gionta Jnr, was hiding out underneath a special fridge which had an electronic trapdoor . The trapdoor allowed access to a tunnel which was designed to keep Gionta Jnr safe during a police raid . Officers uncovered the secret hiding place and found Gionta Jnr hiding at the bottom of a ladder, pictured . Police said Gionta jnr  was arrested in a secret compartment hidden within a flat which was owned by his uncle. An electronic switch operated a trapdoor within the specially adapted fridge which allowed access to the hiding spot. According to official documentation, courts in Naples issued a warrant for his arrest on June 5. He was wanted for questioning over a string of Mafia type offences. The Camorra Clan are believed to be heavily involved in cigarette smuggling as well as controlling city's fishing port, which is used to smuggle heroin, cocaine and cannabis. Police confirmed that Gionta jnr surrendered without a struggle after the hideout was surrounded by heavily armed officers.

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has hit back at Sam Allardyce's claim that his team are a long-ball side - and insists he has the facts to prove it. The United boss turned up for his press conference ahead of Wednesday's match at home to Burnley clutching four sheets of paper that he says rubbish claims Allardyce made after Sunday's draw at West Ham. The whole scene was a slightly bizarre episode that evoked memories of Rafa Benitez's press conference rant, directed at Sir Alex Ferguson, over referees in 2009. Louis van Gaal brandishes part of his dossier as he attempts to prove that United are not a long-ball side . Van Gaal looks unimpressed as he tells a packed press conference about his tactics . Van Gaal was clearly annoyed at Sam Allardyce's comments and he had the pamphlet on his desk waiting when he fielded the first question about the West Ham manager's jibe . The former Barcelona boss insisted his team only started launching balls forward after 6ft 4in Marouane Fellaini came on in the 76th minute of the draw against West Ham . The 63-year-old hands the pages of his dossier to journalists during Tuesday's press conference . The statistics quoted in the A4 pamphlet, which were put together by Van Gaal's analysts, claim West Ham sent a higher percentage of their long passes forward than United during the match. The Hammers attempted 200 passes, according to the figures, and United 343. The pamphlet said 71.1 per cent of West Ham's 'long passes' - of over 25 metres - went forward whereas United's percentage was just 49.9 per cent. Diagrams in the pamphlet claim to show United's passes went sideways or diagonally, rather than forward. This sheet suggests United had a 56 per cent success rate of their 41 'long and forward' passes during the match at West Ham. The blue arrows indicate a successful pass . West Ham made just 11 of their 32 'long and forward' passes during the match, according to boss Van Gaal . Van Gaal claims United made 49.9 per cent of 'long passes forward' in comparison to West Ham's 71 per cent . This page suggests United played 12 long passes after 76 minutes of their 1-1 draw at Upton Park on Sunday. Eight of them were successful. 'When you have 60 per cent ball possession do you think that you can do that with long balls?' Van Gaal asked. 'Yeah, long balls, in the width, to switch the play. You have to look at the data and then you will see that we did play long balls, but long balls wide, rather than to the striker. A ball to the forward striker is mainly caused long-ball play. It is not so difficult also to read that. 'You have to see the data and put the data in the right context I believe.' United's press officer, Karen Shotbolt, reacts as Van Gaal asks her to pass his dossier over to journalists at the press conference . Shotbolt looks less than impressed as the United manager continues to defend his tactics . Cheikhou Kouyate opened the scoring for West Ham in their Premier League match against Man United . Daley Blind scores a late equaliser for Man United at Upton Park to rescue a 1-1 draw for Van Gaal's side . Van Gaal, pictured leaving the Upton Park pitch at half-time, flanked by Ryan Giggs and Albert Stuivenberg . Van Gaal talks regularly about the fact that he wants his teams to play attractive football. He was clearly, therefore, annoyed at Allardyce's comments and he had the pamphlet on his desk waiting when he fielded the first question about the West Ham boss' jibe. 'Because I expected this question, I have made an interpretation of the data for this game and then I have to say that it is not a good interpretation from Big Sam,' said Van Gaal. Speaking after the match, Hammers boss Allardyce said:'’In the end we couldn’t cope with Long-ball United. It's not how you normally see United play, but it got them a goal in the end. 'You might just criticise Louis van Gaal for playing long balls as much as I’m sometimes criticised for being direct. In the end it’s paid off for them so you can’t knock it.’ The Dutchman however, insisted his team only started launching balls forward after 6ft 4in Marouane Fellaini came on in the 76th minute of the draw in east London. 'I am sorry, but we are playing ball possession play and after 70 minutes we did not succeed, in spite of many chances in the second half, then I changed my playing style. Van Gaal poses with Paddy McNair after the defender agreed an extension to his current contract . Van Gaal freely admits that Man United played more long balls when Maroruane Fellaini was introduced . United's change of tack came after 6ft 4in Fellaini was brought on in the second half,  Van Gaal claimed . West Ham manager Allardyce was critical of Van Gaal's tactics following Sunday's encounter . When a colleague of mine is saying this kind of thing then, yeah, you have to see the data and you have to put the data in the right context I believe. I think the media is also coming to the match and you have a lot of opinion about me, or the game, or the players and now you say that you have no opinion. When you have 0 per cent ball possession do you think that you can do that with long balls? Yeah, long balls, in the width, to switch the play. You have to look at the data and then you will see that we did play long balls, but long balls wide, rather than to the striker.  A ball to the forward striker is mainly caused by long-ball play. Because I expected this question, I have made an interpretation of the data for this game and then I have to say that it is not a good interpretation from Big Sam. It is not so difficult also to read that. I am sorry, but we are playing ball possession play and after 70 minutes we did not succeed, in spite of many chances in the second half, then I changed my playing style. Then, of course, with the quality of Fellaini we played more forward balls and we scored from that, so I think it was a very good decision of the manager. But, when you see overall the long ball, and what is the percentage of that, then West Ham have played 71 per cent of the long balls to the forwards and we 49. So, I give you this and you can see that the blue ones are the good ones because long balls are also very difficult, which is why I began with the explanation of ball possession. When you have 60 per cent ball possession you cannot play long balls. So again, they did it 71 and we 49, and I give it you, you can copy it and then maybe you can go to Big Sam and he will get a good interpretation. 'Then, of course, with the quality of Fellaini we played more forward balls and we scored from that, so I think it was a very good decision of the manager. 'But, when you see overall the long ball, and what is the percentage of that, then West Ham have played 71 per cent of the long balls to the forwards and we 49.' After reeling off the statistics, Van Gaal rose from his chair and handed the pamphlet to the reporter who asked the question about Allardyce. The United boss then asked them to analyse the last three pages, which contained diagrams which contained coloured arrows pointing in the direction of both team's passes. 'I give you this and you can see that the blue ones are the good ones because long balls are also very difficult, which is why I began with the explanation of ball possession,' the 63-year-old said. 'When you have 60 per cent ball possession you cannot play long balls. So again, they did it 71 (per cent) and we 49, and I give it to you, you can copy it and then maybe you can go to Big Sam and he will get a good interpretation.' Rafa Benitez infamously lost his cool at Sir Alex Ferguson during a press conference rant back in 2009 . In 2009, Benitez erupted during a press conference and attacked former United boss Ferguson with some similarly pre-planned 'facts'. Here are some of the best bits... Benitez said: 'I was surprised by what has been said, but maybe they [Manchester United] are nervous because we are at the top of the table. 'But I want to talk about facts. I want to be clear, I do not want to play mind games too early, although they seem to want to start. But I have seen some facts. On 1 November, they played Hull and Mr Ferguson had a two-match touchline ban and a £10,000 fine after confronting Mike Dean, the referee, for improper conduct.' 'All managers need to know is that only Mr Ferguson can talk about the fixtures, can talk about referees and nothing happens. 'And about his behaviour with referees. The Southampton manager he knows how Mr Ferguson works and how he works, he was very clear. I am not playing mind games, just facts. 'We need to know that I am talking about facts, not my impression. There are things that everyone can see every single week.' Van Gaal's delivery was calm and he only came to the brink of losing his patience once. 'What do you think?' Van Gaal snapped when first asked about Allardyce's comments, before he regained composure and reeled off his speech on why he thought the former Blackburn manager was wrong. Van Gaal's overall tactics have come in for criticism this season. United may be fourth in the Barclays Premier League, but the team lacks the energy, dynamism and flair of the Sir Alex Ferguson era. 'I think we have played attractive games and less attractive games,' Van Gaal said. 'You can always improve, you can never have a perfect match. 'I am happy with the results, but I also think we can improve which is also the process. We have talked about already from my first day, but we have to improve.'","Louis van Gaal hit back at Sam Allardyce after draw at West Ham .

"One can imagine the funeral. ‘Mad’ Frankie Fraser, who died yesterday a fortnight short of his 91st birthday, will be given the type of reverential gangland send-off that South London and the East End pride themselves upon — plumed horses, ostentatious floral displays and the streets lined with people bidding farewell to a ‘legend’. Yet the word ‘thug’ — or even ‘psychopath’ — does not do complete justice to the brutal nature of this man who was known as an ‘enforcer’, meting out violence on behalf of the Richardson gang in the Sixties. Fraser, pictured left in his police mugshot in the 1960s, and right in 1956 before he was jailed for seven years . Typical of the obsequies paid to him by those who glamorised his murderous career can be found on the website madfrankiefraser.co.uk, where he was described (before his death) as ‘one of the great continuing criminal links with the last century’. Sickeningly, the site elevates him to the status of some sort of precious historical artefact. ‘Frank’ — he was never called ‘Frankie’ by his acolytes because it was deemed insufficiently respectful — was a ‘cell-mate and partner in crime to racecourse swindlers, train robbers and racketeers. He was quaffing beers with old man Charlie Kray while the Twins were still in primary school.’ Summing up his criminal career, it added: ‘Frank has been a contract strong arm, club owner, club minder, company director, Broadmoor inmate, fire-bomber, prison rioter but — first and last — a thief. 26 convictions, 42 years inside.’ The site should have added that Fraser was an astonishingly stupid man — having been caught so often he spent more than half his adult life in prison. Even so, he managed to get married once and have four sons. Only one boy never went to jail. Fraser, left, pictured with the notorious Richardson brothers Eddie and Charlie, during their reign in the 1960s . The Richardson brothers - Charlie and Eddie - who formed the self-named gang, which also became known as the torture gang, in the 1960s. Fraser worked for Charlie Richardson . Outside prison, Fraser was the sort of gangster who, in popular culture, is associated with the Swinging Sixties (though he was fortunate not to end up swinging in a more literal way, at the end of a rope, since capital punishment was abolished in 1965). In a sick comment on our age, he inspired modern films by directors such as Guy Ritchie that revelled in the pornography of London gang violence. Fraser’s one redeeming feature was that he did not attempt to explain away his criminal behaviour. In his autobiography, he stated that there were ‘no excuses’ since both his mother and father were ‘honest, hard-working people’. Born in 1923, he grew up in a South London neighbourhood full of criminals. It was there he acquired the habit of stealing, helped by his sister, who also became a professional thief. ‘You name it, we nicked it,’ he once said. When World War II came, and men of Fraser’s age were eager to serve the country as soon as they could, he feigned illness to avoid being called up to the front line. ‘The war was wonderful, thieving wise, gangster wise, for everything . . . I’ll never forgive Hitler for surrendering’. Fraser was jailed for 10 years in 1967 for his part in the Richardson gang, where he tortured people by pulling out their teeth with pliers if they were disloyal . It was during the war that Fraser was first jailed — as he noted years later: ‘I don’t regret one moment in my life. If I have any regrets at all, it was getting caught.’ In due course, he was called up, deserted, was sent to Borstal for shop-breaking and then, shortly after his release, was convicted and sent to Wandsworth Prison. His propensity for mindless violence — the aspect of his character his admirers seem most to enjoy — manifested itself early on. Though not particularly tall, he was tough, physically fit, and learned early on he could get his way and command ‘respect’ by using violence. He particularly enjoyed assaulting prison staff. In the days before the abolition of judicial corporal punishment, this could have painful consequences. For example, in Borstal, he was birched for such an offence, and in adult prison, later on, was given the cat o’nine tails twice. Fraser boasted that he beat up the public executioner, Albert Pierrepoint, in Wandsworth in 1953 on the day he hanged Derek Bentley — the teenager executed for his part in the murder of a police constable. Fraser said: ‘Sure I was violent, but only to people like myself.’ ‘I suppose I ranked high,’ he bragged about his place in the world of criminality. ‘I’m quite proud of that.’ Serving time in Pentonville for a raid on a jeweller’s shortly after the war, his behaviour became so uncontrollable he was certified insane: his ‘Mad Frankie’ nickname was not the product of exaggeration. Fraser dated Marilyn Wiseby, daughter of the Great Train Robber, Tommy Wiseby, for a number of years . Between serving prison sentences for bank robberies in the early Fifties, he acted as bodyguard to the notorious London gangster Billy Hill, the so-called ‘Boss of the Underworld’ — carrying out razor attacks on victims for £50 a time. Back in prison in 1954, this time in Durham, Fraser was certified insane again and sent to Broadmoor. Surprisingly, he turned into a model inmate and secured a reasonably early release — only to celebrate his freedom by leading a violent attack on a rival gangster, Jack Spot, and his wife, for which he received another seven years. Free again in the early Sixties, Fraser was on the periphery of the Great Train Robbery gang but worked regularly for Charlie Richardson, one of the Krays’ great rivals. Even by Fraser’s standards, the violence became extreme. Having set up a pub fruit machine enterprise as a cover for his crimes, he was accused of the shot-gun murder of another gangster, Billy Hart, in 1966. But a witness changed his evidence at the last minute and charges were dropped. The following year, though, he was convicted at the Old Bailey of torturing men who had been ‘disloyal’ to the Richardsons. Victims had their teeth pulled out with pliers. They were also given electric shocks, whipped and burned. Fraser got ten years in jail.

Mad Frankie Fraser pictured in a publicity shot for gangland movie. His crimes have been glamourised in the decades since his heyday . Horrifying: Fraser at Brick Lane Music Hall in east London in 1995. He was notorious for his torture methods which involved pulling out enemies' teeth with pliers . While in Parkhurst, in 1969, he was one of the leaders of the notorious riots there. With the cat o’nine tails abolished, the usual punishment for his assaults on authority was the loss of remission on his time served — hence his almost permanent absence from the streets of London from the mid-Sixties until the Eighties, by which point he was an old man. Frankie Fraser (pictured in 2012) died yesterday at 90 . After Fraser’s release in the Eighties, he met the daughter of Great Train Robber, Tommy Wisbey — and they were together until 2001. Even after reaching pension-age, Fraser was no stranger to crime. In 1991, he was shot in the head outside a North London club, but refused to name his assailant — though he mischievously dropped hints a policeman was responsible. And only last year, aged 89 and living in sheltered accommodation, he had an Asbo served on him after a violent altercation with a neighbour. But he spent much of his old age in a cynical and manipulative attempt to turn himself into a celebrity — something that was assisted by the parade of writers and TV documentary-makers who beat a path to his door to chronicle the story of his amoral and vicious life. By managing to outlive almost everybody else from the supposed ‘golden age’ of gangland crime, Fraser achieved the fame and adulation he so craved. He was invited to play cameo roles on radio, television and in a number of gangster films. In 1999, he launched a one-man show — An Evening With Mad Frankie Fraser — that toured the country, a highlight of which was when he told his audience how he preferred the cat o’nine tails to the birch because it was ‘more manly’. He touted his memoirs and gave conducted tours of London’s gangland. ‘Honest, hard-working people were safe, women were untouchable,’ he proclaimed. His purpose was to foster the malign notion that there is such a thing as a ‘good, honest criminal’. To anyone with an ounce of morality, such thinking — sadly taken up by so many film-makers and writers — is as repugnant as it is absurd.","Gangland enforcer and torturer Mad Frankie Fraser has died at 90 .

"Social media firms such as Facebook and Twitter should be forced to display 'health warnings' detailing how they use people's personal data, a group of MPs has demanded. The Commons Science and Technology Committee has warned that users need a law degree to understand the terms and conditions used by most companies. Millions of people sign away control of their private information and pictures because they do not understand how they might be used, the committee added. Social media firms such as Facebook and Twitter should be forced to display 'health warnings' detailing how they use people's personal data, a group of MPs has demanded . It calls for social media groups to display much simplified notices on their websites - comparing them to the health warnings on cigarette packets. Andrew Miller MP, the committee's chairman, said the terms and conditions that users agree to are indecipherable. He said nobody really knows how their information is used - because nobody can understand the documents. The problem, he said, is that they are designed for civil cases in US courts, not normal people. 'Let's face it, most people click yes to terms and conditions contracts without reading them, because they are often laughably long and written in the kind of legalese you need a law degree from the USA to understand,' he said. The information we put online can be invaluable to advertisers, enabling them to target their desired market more accurately than ever before. The GPS trackers on our phones track our movements and the videos and photographs we take give a window into our private worlds. Facebook last night said it had recently simplified its terms and conditions. In submissions to the committee in August, Facebook insisted it took data protection seriously . Under data protection laws the companies have to obtain our 'informed consent' before using this information. But MPs fear that we are not truly 'informed' when we click a button to give our consent – because we do not understand the rules. The way technology companies use our data is unclear and the committee wants the government to draw up new laws to bind them to a code of conduct. That would involve telling users exactly how their data might be used - in very simple and concise terms - before they sign up to use a service. The committee highlighted terms for Facebook Messenger's mobile app, used by more than 200,000 million people a month that means it can gain direct access to a mobile or tablet. This means it can take pictures or make videos, at any time without explicit confirmation from the owner. MPs also pointed to criticism of the company earlier this year after it carried out a psychological experiment that recorded users' moods as news feeds on the social network were manipulated. Andrew Miller, who chairs the science and technology committee, said: 'Facebook's experiment with users' emotions highlighted serious concerns about the extent to which, ticking the terms and conditions box, can be said to constitute informed consent when it comes to the varied ways data is now being used by many websites and apps.' The report says: 'Clear communication with the public has been achieved in the past, for example in the use of graphic health warnings on cigarette packets. 'Effective communication with the public can be achieved again.' It adds: 'Millions of individuals from across the globe have signed up to social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, and this phenomena has led to vast collections of personal data. 'We have not been convinced that the users of social media platforms are fully aware of how their data might be used and what redress they may, or may not have if they disagree with how an organisation exploits that data. 'This is exacerbated by our finding that terms and conditions contracts are simply too long and complex for any reasonable person to make any real sense of. Reading such documents has been likened to engaging with 'Shakespeare'. 'Drafted by lawyers, to be used in American court rooms, the contents of terms and conditions have been designed to protect organisations in the event of legal action. 'As a mechanism for showing that users have provided informed consent, so that organisations can process incredibly persona data, terms and conditions contracts are simply not fit for purpose.' The MPs are also critical of the government's own record on data protection. They cite the disastrous NHS plan to harvest patients' medical data to improve services - a programme that has been delayed over privacy fears. The committee demands that the Government gets its own house in order and improves data transparency, before it can turn its attention to pushing through a new set of guidelines for social media firms. Andrew Miller MP, the committee's chairman, said the terms and conditions that users agree to are indecipherable. He said nobody really knows how their information is used - because nobody can understand the documents. Twitter, however, said its privacy policy was just four pages and 2,000 words in length . Mr Miller said: 'Socially responsible companies wouldn't want to bamboozle their users, of course, so we are sure most social media developers will be happy to sign up to the new guidelines on clear communication and informed consent that we are asking the Government to draw up. 'I hope that a voluntary system of guidelines can work, because, if not, legislation might be needed.' Facebook last night said it had recently simplified its terms and conditions. In submissions to the committee in August, Facebook insisted it took data protection seriously. Using social media such as Twitter for behavioural studies is cheap and fast - but fraught with bias, warns a new study. The rise of social media has been used by behavioural scientists to quickly and cheaply gather huge amounts of data about what people are thinking and doing. However, computer scientists warn that such massive datasets may be misleading. The findings, published in the journal Science, contend that scientists need to find ways of correcting for the biases inherent in the information gathered from Twitter and other social media, or to at least acknowledge the shortcomings of that data. Doctor Juergen Pfeffer, an assistant research professor at Carnegie Mellon Univesity's Institute for Software Research, and Doctor Derek Ruths, an assistant professor of computer science at McGill Univesity, note that thousands of research papers every year are now based on data gleaned from social media, a source of data that barely existed just five years ago. Dr Pfeffer said: 'Not everything that can be labelled as 'Big Data' is automatically great.' He noted that many researchers think - or hope - that if they gather a large enough dataset they can overcome any biases or distortion that might lurk there. Following the Boston Marathon bombing last year, for example, Dr Pfeffer collected 25 million related tweets in just two weeks. He said: 'You get the behaviour of millions of people - for free.' But, he said social media sites often have substantial population biases; generating the random samples that give surveys their power to accurately reflect attitudes and behaviour is problematic. Instagram, for instance, has special appeal to adults between the ages of 18 and 29, African-Americans, Latinos, women and urban dwellers, while Pinterest is dominated by women between the ages of 25 and 34. However, Dr Pfeffer said researchers seldom acknowledge, much less correct, these built-in sampling biases. 'We devote the necessary resources to ensure we meet our data protection obligations,' the firm wrote. 'This includes having a dedicated data protection team that brings together expertise from legal, policy, platform, law enforcement, security, engineering and community operations.' Twitter said its privacy policy was just four pages and 2,000 words in length. It added 'Twitter continually strives to ensure the right balance between providing adequate information whilst also ensuring it is approachable and user friendly.' The LinkedIn Corporation said: 'Our members use LinkedIn because they trust it with their professional reputation. 'We recognise that this trust is earned by both respecting our members' privacy and properly protecting their personal information.'","Committee compared it to the health warnings on cigarette packets .

While the subsistence team typically starts planning to ship holiday meal six months in advance, military operations in West Africa only began two months ago. It meant that the turkeys had to be airlifted to the bases in time for them to be served. Two days ago it was revealed that some personnel returning to Joint Base Lewis-McChord from Africa will spend Thanksgiving in isolation while the Army monitors their health for signs of Ebola. The group arriving Tuesday evening includes 15 service members and one Defense Department civilian who built facilities in Liberia to fight the fatal disease, the Army said. They were not exposed to Ebola-infected patients and the risk that they picked up the fatal disease is very minimal, said I Corps Maj. Mary Ricks. Because they have no symptoms, the isolation is called controlled monitoring rather than quarantine, Ricks said Tuesday. They'll have their temperature taken twice a day during their stay, which won't be a full 21 days because they've already spent some time in Germany. Lewis-McChord is not their home base. They come from all over the country and one is stationed overseas, Ricks said. Servicemen queue up patiently alongside piled-up trays and cutlery as they await their well-deserved turkey in Kosovo .

Sol Campbell had the details of his property portfolio read out to him on television by a Labour frontbencher, in the latest row over the mansion tax. The ex-England footballer claimed Ed Miliband’s plan to levy a tax on homes worth more than £2million was ‘unfair’ and intended to ‘punish’ people who had done well. He was filmed walking around his lavish home in London’s Chelsea, making an espresso, explaining that he had paid all his income tax and stamp duty and never used offshore tax havens. Mr Campbell argued that instead of taxing property, Labour should press companies such as Google, Starbucks and Amazon, who were shamed for avoiding tax, to pay their fair share. But he was attacked by Labour’s Owen Smith, who told him: ‘This is nonsense’. He added that people who were struggling ‘will have zero sympathy with millionaires like you pleading poverty’. The shadow Welsh secretary then read out a list of all the footballer’s properties while the pair were guests on BBC2’s Daily Politics, although Mr Campbell disputed some of the details. ‘I looked you up before coming here and I see you’ve got a £25million house in Chelsea that you’ve just put up for sale, you’ve got a big country pile in Northumberland and another flat in Chelsea’, the Labour MP said. ‘And I also saw that the place you’ve got in Cheyne Walk [his home in Chelsea], you were renting out for £75,000 a month’. Mr Campbell, 40, did not dispute the first two properties but said the rental of his home ‘didn’t happen’. Mr Smith added: ‘Well you can tell me whether the others are right but we are talking about £3,000 a year extra that you would pay for a £2million to £3million property.’ The footballer said people who could be hit by the tax include families who bought a home in Hackney in north London for £300,000 some years ago and have seen it soar in value. He added that properties in Northumberland and the suburbs of Manchester were ‘a long way away from London and oligarchs’. In his pre-recorded film, shown before he appeared on the show, he said: ‘An Englishman’s home is his castle but under Labour’s proposal for a mansion tax that castle is under threat. Mr Campbell said he felt politicians should be pursuing companies who avoid paying tax instead . The former England footballer told BBC2 Daily Politics he was being punished for investing in property . ‘Labour’s plans hit those properties valued at over £2million will penalise those individuals who have done well for themselves. Ed Miliband keeps banging on about fairness in society but this tax is anything but fair. And its flawed. 'Over the years I’ve paid millions in income tax and stamp duty but I’m punished for investing in a property portfolio. ‘I don’t rely on offshore tax havens and I don’t want to invest in stocks and shares…I see this as a tax on aspiration. Labour would be better off targeting companies like Google, Amazon, Starbucks, making them pay a fairer level of tax rather than picking on people like me who have already paid their dues ten times over.’ Mr Campbell put his £25m Chelsea property up for sale last month ahead of the clash about the mansion tax . Sol Campbell also owns Hallington Hall in Northumberland with his wife Fiona Barratt-Campbell . Mr Campbell's Chelsea home also has a mews house, connected to the main house by an underground tunnel . Mr Campbell said the proposed mansion tax would penalise people who had done well for themselves while Owen Smith MP (right) said people would have little sympathy with millionaires like him 'pleading poverty' Tory chairman Grant Shapps, who was also on the programme claimed ‘Labour’s instinct is to tax everything’. He said the costs of implementing it meant it would not raise the £1.3billion intended and claimed the £2million threshold may have to drop. Mr Campbell is married to Barratt Homes heiress Fiona Barratt-Campbell. As a defender for Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal, until he retired in 2011, he used to earn £100,000 a week. Their six-bedroom home in Chelsea with views over the Thames went on sale for £25million last month. The Sunday Times Rich List 2013 put his wealth at £33million. He last month suggested he might join the Conservative party and had been in talks about a sports role. Sol Campbell is the latest celebrity to hit out at the mansion tax, after Myleene Klass attacked Ed Miliband about it on television, and wildlife presenter Bill Oddie said he would not be voting Labour next year as he’s a mansion-owner. London mayoral hopefuls Tessa Jowell and David Lammy have also said it would be a tax on London where 90pc of the affected homes are located.","Sol Campbell owns £25m house in London and Northumberland mansion .

"An artist who had her identity stolen by a woman in 2011 has found a unique and interesting way to deal with the horrific experience. Jessamyn Lovell, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, had her wallet stolen from the gallery SF Camerawork in San Francisco by a woman named Erin Hart, leading to months of mysterious bills, parking tickets, and even a summons to appear in court on theft charges. Angry and frustrated, she channeled her rage into a new art project, Dear Erin Hart. Getting her back: Angry and frustrated, Jessamyn Lovell began to photograph Erin Hart (pictured) after she was released from prison on identity theft charges, some of which were related to Lovell . Show: These photographs became the inspiration for her project Dear Erin Hart . After tracking down Hart through a private investigator, she was waiting for the woman as she was released from prison on identity theft charges, some of which were related to Lovell. Then, Lovell began following, and photographing, her wherever she went. There are photos of her on the bus and at a gas station, walking around the city and even shopping for clothes. All over: She would photograph Hart everywhere, from the gas station to the bus to clothes shopping . Not letting up: Now, Lovell wants to confront Hart with a letter she wrote . She held an exhibition of the photos last month at SF Camerawork, the same place she had her identity stolen, and now Lovell is trying to raise money through a crowdfunding campaign to travel to San Francisco and present Hart with a letter she wrote her. Above all else, Lovell wants Hart to be forced to see the victim of her crime. What does she know?: Hart has made no comment about this, though she appears to be aware of the camera in some shots . On her way: The photos from the project have now been put on display . Getting her due: Lovell hopes that Hart will accept her letter . People can donate funds on etsy. Hart has yet to respond, though she does seem to be aware of the photographer in many of the shots.","Artist and photographer Jessamyn Lovell had her identity stolen in 2011 .

"A breath test could spot the early signs of Type 1 diabetes in children long before they start to show symptoms, scientists have discovered. Oxford University researchers are developing a hand-held device which could quickly identify the autoimmune disease, potentially saving many lives. Unlike Type 2 diabetes, Type 1 diabetes is not caused by lifestyle or diet. The condition, which is thought to be genetic, means the body cannot produce its own insulin, stopping proper regulation of blood sugar. Insulin pump: Type 1 diabetes is not caused by lifestyle or diet. The condition, which is thought to be genetic, means the body cannot produce its own insulin, stopping proper regulation of blood sugar (file picture) It affects 400,000 people in Britain, usually first striking in childhood or adolescence. In one in four cases it is only picked up when the patient becomes gravely ill as their blood sugar levels soar. Scientists hope their new discovery will help spot the condition much earlier, and reduce the rate of children falling into a harmful state called diabetic ketoacidosis – which can lead to coma or death. The researchers have discovered a chemical produced by children with diabetes which makes their breath smell faintly of pear drops. Although difficult to pick up by scent alone, they have developed a test which can spot the chemical on the breath of a child, giving an accurate and early indication of future problems. It could allow a GP to identify the problem before a child is rushed into hospital – the traumatic way in which many people find out they have the disease. The breakthrough, published today in the Journal of Breath Research, came about after tests on 113 children and teenagers aged seven to 18 at Oxford Children’s Hospital. They found that children with low levels of insulin produced a chemical called ketone in their breath, giving it a faint smell of pear drops. The chemical is an early sign of diabetic ketoacidosis, the condition associated with half the deaths of young people with diabetes. Study:  Researchers at Oxford University (pictured) are developing a hand-held device which could quickly identify the autoimmune disease, potentially saving many lives . It occurs when a lack of insulin means the body cannot use sugar for energy and starts to break down fat instead. Ketones are the by-product of the breakdown of fat and, if left unchecked, can build up and cause the body to become acidic. One specific form of ketone in the breath, called acetone, was found to be an accurate signal of the extent of the child’s diabetes. The scientists, who hope to use their discovery to produce a handheld breathalyser, would be used in regular check-ups if a child shows early symptoms – which include tiredness, thirst and a lack of energy. A blood test is currently used to the same effect, but they believe doctors would be more likely to use a breath test on a hunch, and children more likely to accept one. Professor Gus Hancock, who co-wrote the study, said: ‘While breath acetone has been measured in relatively large cohorts of healthy individuals, most measurements on people with Type 1 diabetes have been carried out on relatively small cohorts, typically made up of less than 20 people, with relatively few measurements on children. ‘Our results have shown that it is realistically possible to use measurements of breath acetone to estimate blood ketones. ‘We are working on the development of a small hand held device that would allow the possibility of breath measurements for ketone levels and help to identify children with new diabetes before diabetic ketoacidosis supervenes. ‘Currently testing for diabetes requires a blood test which can be traumatic for children.’ He said the test could also be used in already-diagnosed children, to establish when their condition was deteriorating. ‘If the relationship between breath acetone and blood ketone levels is true at higher levels of ketones, a simple breath-test could assist with the management of sick days in children with diabetes, preventing hospital admissions by providing a warning of the possible development of diabetic ketoacidosis.’ The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which raises funds for scientific investigation into Type one diabetes, last night welcomed the breakthrough. Karen Addington, UK chief executive of JDRF, said: ‘Early diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes is crucial if people are to avoid being hospitalised with diabetic ketoacidosis. This is life-threatening and extremely traumatic for the individual’s wider family. ‘Any new knowledge from research that could help doctors to diagnose people more swiftly is to be very warmly welcomed. I hear far too many stories from people who were turned away by their doctors after their first visit.’ She added: ‘The best known symptoms of Type one diabetes are the “four ts” - more visits to the toilet, increased thirst, increased tiredness, and getting thinner. 'But sweet-smelling breath, also known as pear drop breath, is another important clue. Some or all of these symptoms can be present.’","Oxford University researchers are developing hand-held device .

"Yet another video that appears to show the Florida 22-year-old who carried out a suicide bomb attack in Syria has emerged. In this video posted to YouTube on Wednesday, a man believed to be Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha claims he was under FBI surveillance before he fled the United States. The videos are likely the final tales the Florida born man ever told before driving a huge truck bomb into a restaurant and blowing up soldiers of the Syrian government. American jihadist: Yet another video that appears to show the Florida 22-year-old who carried out a suicide bomb attack in Syria has emerged . In the video, the Palestinian-American says that he initially trained in Syria in 2012 before returning to the US. At that point, he says, he was tailed by the FBI. However, he somehow managed to board a plane back to the Middle East, where he became the first American suicide bomber in Syria on May 25. He also says he was comforted by the . teachings of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born jihadist killed by a . drone in Yemen three years ago, as he weighed his decision to go to . Syria and ultimately to blow up himself and a restaurant full of people. 'In . a lecture, Anwar al-Awlaki said...it's like a cliff, jump off the cliff . and you don't know if the water is deep or shallow. Don't know if . there's rocks or if it’s going to be very deep. You just have to jump . and put your faith in Allah that it's going to be deep and you won't be . harmed, that you’re going to be safe after you land in the water.' Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha also describes in the video called 'Part 1: the Hijrah' how he idolized the American-born jihadist Anwar al-Awlaki who was killed by a drone strike in Yemen . The video's opening credits describe the interview as 'Part 1: The Hijrah,' suggesting more will follow. A previous video emerged of the smiling Florida man believed in late July, showing him burning his US passport before delivering a haunting message. The footage of Abu-Salha - a college drop out who blew himself up in May while detonating a truck full of explosives outside a restaurant in Syria - further demonstrates how intent he was to die for his cause. It shows the American jihadi ripping, chewing and then setting fire to his American passport against a haunting soundtrack of Arabic music. 'You think you're safe where you are, in America or Britain or Indonesia or Jordan or China or Russie or Somalia or Africa? Jihardi: Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, 22, is seen here in a newly-released video, where he rips up, chews and burns his American passport . The Florida man blew himself up in May while detonating a truck full of explosives outside a restaurant in Syria where soldiers liked to gather . Haunting: In the accompany video, Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha talks to the camera about how no one is safe . 'You are not safe. I have one word to say ... we are coming for you. Mark my words. 'You think you killed Osama bin Laden? You sent him to paradise.' 'Just know that we are coming.' This is not the first frightening footage of Abu-Salha. In footage released by an al-Qaeda-linked group fighting in Syria recently, he was shown making a bomb and strapping it to his body. 'I want to rest in the afterlife, in heaven,' Abu-Slaha says in that video. 'There is nothing here, my heart is not resting here in this life.' Jihadi good time: Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha (right) is shown joking around with a fellow terrorist in the chilling video . All smiles: Florida college dropout-turned-suicide bomber Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha was filmed smiling and talking about wanting to die . Blast: Abu-Salha is believed to have taken part in a mass suicide bombing that targeted the army in Syria in May . The 22-year-old, who once lived about . 130 miles from Miami, is believed to have been part of a mass suicide . bombing on May 25 which targeted several army positions. The Nusra Front, which released the video, claimed two of the other three suicide attackers in the assault in the government-held northwestern city of Idlib were from foreign countries, including one from the Maldives. 'Glorious is God, and thanks God, his is a grace from him,' Abu-Salha continues. 'When I came to Syria, I had nothing. 'I had no money to buy a gun and ammunition, now God granted me all of that and much more.' The grinning geurilla is then shown making the bomb believed to have been in the truck Abu-Salha  and others drove as they stormed their target. 'Heaven is better,' he said in a previously-released video. 'When people die they either go to heaven or hell. There is happiness beyond explanation.' The video was posted on jihadi websites. It corresponded with the Associated Press reporting about the attack and Abu-Salha. All-American: Abu-Salha grew up in Florida, where he played youth league basketball . Opposition forces previously identified the American who carried out the bombing as Abu Hurayra al-Amriki and said he was a U.S. citizen. The name al-Amriki means 'the American' in Arabic. It is unknown how many people were killed in the bombing. Opposition rebels with the Nusra Front said Abu-Salha's truck was laden with 16 tons of explosives to tear down the al-Fanar restaurant, a gathering site for Syrian troops. The other suicide attackers targeted nearby army positions. Abu-Salha grew up in Florida and attended several colleges before dropping out and moving abroad. He lived in various parts of the Sunshine State, where his parents ran several grocery stores. At one point, he shared an apartment with his brother about 130 miles from Miami. The 22-year-old had appeared to have had a regular American upbringing, playing on a basketball youth league, and enjoying sports. But recent trips to Syria had meant federal officials were already keeping an eye on him, the New York Times reported. Thousands of foreign fighters have come to Syria from around the world to fight against President Bashar Assad's forces after the uprising against his government began three years ago. The war, which began in 2011, has since taken on strong sectarian overtones, pitting a Sunni-led insurgency that includes al-Qaeda-inspired extremist groups against a government dominated by Assad's minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. Roots: Abu-Salha grew up in Florida, where his parents run several grocery stores . New path: After dropping out of college, Abu-Salha moved abroad . Syria's . uprising began with peaceful protests in March 2011 but escalated into . an armed revolt when government forces launched a sweeping crackdown on . dissent. The . conflict has killed at least 170,000 people, nearly a third of them . civilians, according to activists. Nearly 3 million Syrians have fled . the country. On Saturday, a car bomb exploded in a northern Syrian town near the Turkish border, killing and wounding a number of people. The Aleppo Media Center said the car bomb exploded in a vegetable market in the town of Azaz. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the car blew up near a gas station in Azaz. The Observatory said the blast killed at least four people and wounded several others. The AMC said it killed and wounded a number of people, without offering specific figures. The Observatory and an Idlib-based activist who goes by the name of Asad Kanjo said another car blew up in the northern village of Atmeh near the Turkish border. The Observatory said the blast killed two people. Kanjo said the blast occurred near a market and close to a children's hospital, though it was not affected. The Observatory also said the Syrian troops recaptured the Shaer gas field in the central province of Homs a week after fighters from the Islamic State group captured it and killed dozens of soldiers. Syrian state television confirmed that troops recaptured the field, saying that 'large numbers of Islamic State terrorists were wiped out.' The Observatory said a missile shot down the helicopter Friday night over a neighborhood of Aleppo known as Camp Nairab. Camp Nairab is adjacent to the Nairab military airport southeast of the city, where government aircraft take off to carry out attacks in northern Syria. Attack: Abu-Salha, left, is believed to have driven a truck, top right, filled with explosives to a restaurant where troops gather before blowing it, and himself, up . Assad's forces use helicopters to drop barrel bombs - crude explosives that have killed thousands of people and caused widespread destruction, especially in Aleppo. The Observatory and an Aleppo-based activist who goes by the name Abu Saeed Izzedine said the helicopter crash killed four people, including a child. The Observatory said three of the dead were the helicopter's crew members. Aleppo, once Syria's commercial capital, has been the scene of heavy fighting since rebels seized part of the city in 2012. The Observatory also reported Saturday that the number of soldiers killed over the past few days in a northern military base in Raqqa that was overrun by the extremist Islamic State group has risen to 85. It said the fate of 200 others was still unknown. The monitoring group, which relies on a network of activists inside the country, said Islamic State fighters have executed and paraded the bodies of 'tens' of soldiers in Raqqa, the only provincial capital in rebel hands. Amateur videos posted online by activists showed more than a dozen beheaded bodies in a busy square said to be in Raqqa. Some of the heads were placed on a nearby fence, where at least two headless bodies were crucified. The video appeared genuine and corresponded to other AP reporting of the events.","A fourth video of Florida man Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha has emerged in which he claims he was followed by the FBI while in the US .

"With shoppers queueing from the early hours and millions logging onto the internet to snaffle the best bargains, you could be forgiven for thinking the Boxing Day sales have come early. For today retailers across Britain have slashed their prices in ‘Black Friday’ sales, offering everything from televisions to dresses, designer handbags, homewares and toys at huge discounts. And you don't have to brave the High Street — most retailers are offering the same discounts online as in store. Better still, many discounts will be available over the whole weekend. Inside this exclusive guide we will tell you how to get incredible bargains, teach you how shop safely online, and reveal the celebrities' best sale buys. Black Friday sales began as an American tradition, in which shoppers would race to snap up bargains on the first Friday after the Thanksgiving holiday. The name was coined by Philadelphia police in the Sixties after hordes of rampant shoppers caused havoc. Scroll down for video . With the rise of internet shopping, British consumers noticed U.S. stores were offering amazing pre-Christmas deals. And then in 2010 online store Amazon introduced UK Black Friday sales. High Street retailers quickly followed suit, and over the past two years sales have soared. Indeed, credit card company Visa predicts spending in the UK will be up 22 per cent on last year, with £1 million spent on its cards every three minutes today. Shoppers will be thinking about Christmas presents, and there should be plenty to choose from. John Lewis, which opens its flagship Oxford Street store an hour early, has pledged to price-match discounts from competitors, as will Tesco, Mothercare, Currys, Evans Cycles and Halfords. Supermarkets are also offering lots of bargains, but you'll have to be quick to snap up the best ones — Sainsbury's will start its sale at 1am in its 24-hour stores, while many Tesco branches will open at one minute past midnight. Asda, whose sales are due to start at 8am, has 700,000 Black Friday products on offer in 441 stores. There were fights among customers last year when Asda led the adoption of the US tradition and the firm is extending its sale to two days this year. Retailers including John Lewis, Marks & Spencer, House of Fraser and Debenhams are promising deals of up to 70 per cent off. Some 700,000 products are being offered at knock down prices, including a 40-inch TV for £139 and an Archos tablet for just £29. John Lewis is offering a Delonghi coffee machine for half price at £595, while Marks & Spencer is launching a four-day sale with savings of up to 30 per cent. Debenhams is selling women’s designer dresses at half price. While Tesco – which is slashing prices by up to 70 per cent – opened its branches at a minute past midnight to catch early bird shoppers. But even if you miss deals this weekend, don't worry — on Monday retailers launch more online discounts for 'Cyber Monday', traditionally the year's biggest internet shopping day. We've got plenty of ideas in this pull-out for that day, too. For many retailers this weekend signals the start of a sale season which will go on through to January. All you need to do to take advantage of the next few days of deals is dust off your credit card, turn the page and get started. Happy shopping! Bag a Black Friday bargain: Supermarkets . Look what you can buy on Cyber Monday . 1. IS THE SITE GENUINE? It should include the retailer’s name, address and email address. Check for a tiny padlock or unbroken key symbol before the web address, and be sure the address begins with https:// (the ‘s’ is for ‘secure’). Genuine firms won’t feature the names of popular items or cheap prices in their web address. 2. RESEARCH STORES . If you’ve spotted a gift from a relatively unknown company, Google it and see what comes up. Check internet consumer forums. When browsing for goods, don’t be fooled by a site ranked highly in search results. 3. PAY BY CREDIT CARD . For goods costing £100-plus, a credit card gives more protection than a debit card, prepaid card or PayPal. If an order goes astray, the goods break or the firm goes bust, you can claim from the card provider. Never pay by cash transfer. 4. SPEND £50 ON ANTI-VIRUS PROTECTION . From ‘phishing’ emails to spyware, fraudsters are adept at hacking online accounts, so get an up-to-date firewall from the likes of Norton or McAfee for £20 to £50. 5. PASSWORDS SHOULD NOT BE TOO PERSONAL . Avoid obvious names or dates, and try not to use the same password for all sites. To create a complex password, use a mnemonic: for example, pick a song, the year it came out, and stick a £ sign at the end. You can vary it for different websites by adding the first two letters of the site you’re visiting. 6. SWITCH OFF OR LOG OUT . Turn off a PC if you’re not using it, especially after a browsing session (a favourite time for hackers). If a site offers you a choice of storing your payment details or making a one-off purchase, go for the latter. 7. USE A STORE’S APP . If you’re buying gifts and using your smartphone, do it on the retailer’s app rather than using the main website. A dedicated app, if available, offers greater software protection than a web browser, especially if you’re in a public place. 8. IF YOU’RE STILL NERVOUS . Choose websites that allow you to order online but pay only when you pick up the goods in person. High Street names including Waterstones, Argos and PC World now offer this.","Retailers across Britain will slash their prices in 'Black Friday' sales offering everything from televisions to dresses .

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has denied a charge of misconduct from the Football Association. Van Gaal was charged for criticising referee Chris Foy after United's 0-0 draw with Cambridge in the FA Cup on January 23. The FA charged Van Gaal last week, saying his words 'allege and/or imply bias on the part of the match referee and/or bring the game into disrepute.' Louis van Gaal has denied a charge of misconduct following Manchester United's draw with Cambridge . The Dutchman asked the Football Association for more time ahead of making his official appeal . 'We knew in advance everything would be against us - but you have to survive,' the 63-year-old said after his side were forced to a rematch by a stubborn Cambridge performance at Abbey Stadium. 'And then you have seen the referee - its always the same. Everywhere I have coached these games, and I have coached them with other clubs, it's always the same. 'What was wrong with the referee? You can give your own opinion, I can't give mine.' Van Gaal always maintained he would contest the charge last week having requested an extra day from the FA to formalise his response. Van Gaal made comments about referee Chris Foy after his side were forced into a replay against the U's . The Dutchman said ahead of their clash at West Ham on Sunday: ‘I am not angry, I am very disappointed. I am now for nearly 30 years a trainer-coach or manager and I have never been charged. And still, up to now, I don’t think that I said something wrong. ‘I said already in our press conference (before the game) the same phrases, because I know in advance everything is in favour of the underdog. ‘I said it before the game and I said it after the game, only in the meaning of the general feeling of everybody, everybody for the underdog,' added van Gaal. ‘So I cannot imagine the FA has charged me. But, OK, it’s like that. Of course I will contest it. I never said anything wrong. You can confirm, as the media, that I never say anything about the referee, in all the matches.’ The FA confirmed the news on their Twitter page: 'Louis Van Gaal denies FA misconduct charge in relation to media comments and requests a personal hearing, date to be confirmed.'

"A who's who of Australia's top actors, musicians, media personalities, sport legends and business identities have come together to take a stand against refugee children being held in detention. Most of the prominent 37 Aussies are not known for holding a tune but they didn't stop them from singing from the heart when they recorded they song 'We're better than this.' Veteran actor Bryan Brown came up with the idea for a song after speaking with well-known friends who wanted to join the campaign to put a stop to refugee children being locked in detention facilities both on and off Australian shores. Scroll down for video . Actor Bryan Brown asked his well-known mates to join him in a 'We Are The World type video' Actress Rebecca Gibney is one of 37 prominent Australians who jumped on board the 'We're better than this' campaign . 'It's too easy to sit around and talk about things and you sort of have to get off your bum and do stuff. This is appalling how these children are being treated, ' Brown told the ABC. Brown said he received an overwhelming response after sending about 100 emails to well-known identities who were keen to a be a part of Live Aid's 'We Are The World type video'. Some of the big names include actors Claudia Karvan, Rebecca Gibney and Deborah Mailman as well as musicians - John Williamson, Glenn Shorrock and Mahalia Barnes. 'Do we want future citizens of Australia to start their lives like this?' asked Karvan, who has two children fo her own and a step-child, in the video. 'Do we want future citizens of Australia to start their lives like this?' actor Claudia Karvan asks in the video .

'I find it deeply depressing to think that a country that I have a lot of pride in can actually think that this is alright how we look after children, by putting them behind barbed wire where children are self-harming,' he said. The father-of-three said he was appalled that there are currently over 700 children being held on both the mainland and off-shore facilities at the behest of the Australian Government and the average length of time spent by both children and adults is more than 400 days. 'There are many Australians who are appalled by this and that's where the idea to start this real people movement came from,' he said in a statement.

"In a recent opinion piece published in Uganda's New Vision newspaper, president Yower Museveni argued that the country's Tourism Promotion Board does little to market the country properly. According to Museveni, the east African nation is a 'better destination' than Spain for holidaymakers, but because of poor promotion, visitors are simply unaware. The tourism board, he writes, only promotes Uganda as having 'some chimpanzees and so on.' Ugandan president Yower Museveni wrote opinion piece for New Vision newspaper arguing that the Tourism Promotion Board does not market the country properly. Pictured: Sipi Falls in Mount Elgon . 'The biggest problem with tourism is poor promotion,' the president (pictured) wrote in his opinion piece . In his piece, Museveni even goes so far as to say that Uganda's Tourism Board should be renamed the 'tourism suppression board'. 'The biggest problem with tourism is poor promotion,' he wrote. 'In Europe, people go to the Mediterranean coast. 'I visited Spain, it is very hot and humid in the summer. 'I think Uganda would be a better destination than some of those destinations.' According to Museveni, Spain is too hot and humid in the summer - and Uganda would be a much better . He further argued that Uganda was 'a good place on globe where you go and have a nice life'. 'We are right on the Equator but because of the high altitude, we have snow-capped mountains, but even when there is no snow, the climate is very mild - very good for the human beings.' Earlier in November, Museveni made similar remarks while opening the 39th World Congress of the African Travel Association. During the conference, the president called many parts of Africa - such as its tropical forests, lakes, rivers and snow-capped mountains - miracles and, as such, great tourist attractions. He also called upon tourists to take advantage of Africa's beautiful climate. 'The climate is very mild,' he insists. 'Very good for human beings.' Pictured: Kidepo Valley National Park . Though the president also insisted that peace is prevailing in most part of Africa, and that 'pockets' of conflict and strange diseases cannot severely affect the tourism industry, The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to the region of north eastern Uganda with the exception of trips to Kidepo Valley National Park. Visitors are warned about the  high threat from terrorism in the country, however, it seems that the Ebola outbreak has been confined to the other side of the continent. Three specific cases of the outbreak have been contained by the country and Uganda has likewise contained two outbreaks of the Marbug virus, which the president also highlighted in his opinion piece.","Argued for better tourism promotion in New Vision newspaper op-ed .

"The debate over refereeing standards in the Barclays Premier League has taken a new twist after it emerged Phil Dowd has admitted to getting his decision wrong in the Wayne Rooney penalty incident at Preston North End. Officials in the top flight are under more scrutiny than ever as the season approaches a crucial stage with Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho piling on the pressure after the controversial sending-off of Nemanja Matic in the game against Burnley at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. And now Sportsmail can reveal that Dowd – one of the game’s top referees – has admitted privately that he got the week’s other big controversial call wrong when he awarded Rooney a late penalty after he fell under a challenge from Preston goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckmann at Deepdale last Monday. Phil Dowd has admitted his decision to award Wayne Rooney a penalty against Preston North End was wrong . Rooney ran past goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckmann at the edge of the penalty area with the ball . The England forward takes a step over the goalkeeper's outstretched legs to chase the ball late on in the game . Rooney falls to the ground but it later emerged from replays that there was no contact with the striker . Rooney was criticised by many for allegedly diving after he had hurdled Stuckmann’s challenge late in Manchester United’s 3-1 win in the FA Cup. It was argued that the United captain had received no contact from the Preston goalkeeper and should have been booked. Dowd awarded the penalty – that Rooney scored – without hesitation but it is now understood that he has told a colleague that he realised after analysing the post-match video that he had got it wrong. A source told Sportsmail: 'Phil said that he was adamant at the time that he had got the decision right. Stuckmann already begins to plead his innocence as Rooney hits the deck at Deepdale last Monday . The England and Manchester United skipper dusted himself down to smash in the penalty for United . 'But he is a very honest bloke and, like all referees, he looks back on his games on TV. 'With this one, he has realised that he probably shouldn’t have awarded a penalty. It was a mistake.' The incident was so tough to call at the time that it split the game’s pundits with Stan Collymore calling Rooney a cheat but Jamie Carragher and Gary Lineker both suggesting that penalty may have been the right call. Rooney sent Stuckmann the wrong way and made it 3-1 to United, effectively sending them through in the cup .

"Eurosceptics who want Britain to leave the EU have been branded ‘unpatriotic’ by Nick Clegg. The Deputy Prime Minister tore into the Conservatives and the UK Independence Party who want to sever ties with the European Union, claiming it would leave many people ‘poorer’ and the country as a whole ‘weaker’. In a co-ordinated Lib Dem strike, Treasury minister Danny Alexander also claimed 'if you are anti-Europe, you are anti-business, anti-growth' after multimillionaire Paul Sykes vowed to do ‘whatever it takes’ to bankroll Ukip’s campaign machine for next year’s Euro elections. National interest: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was 'unpatriotic' to argue Britain should leave the EU . Europe has become one of the deepest fault lines in the coalition since David Cameron vowed to negotiate a new deal with Brussels before staging an in-out referendum by 2017. Mr Clegg has vowed to campaign to remain in the EU, and claimed it is the ‘patriotic’ thing to do. Ukip is already tipped to win the elections to the European Parliament in May next year. But Eurosceptic businessman Mr Sykes, who used to be a Conservative Party backer, is promising to use part of his £650million fortune to raise the part’s profile still further. He said: ‘We’re merely using our money to engage the British public in a subject that I think’s very important to them and all we’re basically doing is taking opinion polls and finding out that two-thirds of the British people want certain things – it’s not happening. Eurosceptics are 'anti-business and anti-growth', the top Lib Dem at the Treasury claimed last night. In a speech to 200 business leaders, Danny Alexander claimed anti-Europeans were failing to act in the national interest. Speaking . to the City Network this evening, Mr Alexander said: 'The anti-European . tendency is set on forcing Britain out of the European Union. 'The consequence would be to throw away these huge economic advantages. 'There is an anti-Europe alliance that has a loud voice, including a large and growing chunk of the Conservative party. My message is simple: If you are anti-Europe, you are anti-business, anti-growth, acting against the best interests of your country. Imagine if the Conservative party were in government by themselves. 'The anti-Europe faction really would call the tune, and Britain would be irrevocably damaged.' ‘And I intend to help them to make that happen so they, the people, will decide hopefully,’ he told BBC Radio 4. But Mr Clegg used his monthly press conference yesterday to accuse anyone who wants to leave the EU of being unpatriotic. He said: ‘I think the view represented by Ukip, large parts of the Conservative Party and Paul Sykes is a betrayal of the national interest and an unpatriotic approach. 'It would leave many people poorer, it would leave us weaker as a country and it would throw many people out of work, and I can't possibly see why anyone thinks that that is something that in any way represents the long-term national interest.’ Mr Clegg said he was ‘relishing the opportunity of taking on eurosceptics in next year's European elections’ and would campaign to stay in the EU. He added: ‘The Conservative Party seems to me to be flirting with exit altogether, and the Labour Party seems to have lost the courage of its own convictions on Europe. ‘Ukip represents the view that we should yank ourselves out of the European Union, with all the disastrous consequences for millions of people whose jobs and livelihoods depend on membership of that club . ‘I relish the opportunity to stake our claim in this debate on the opposite side of the debate and say “Yes, the EU needs to be reformed, yes, it needs to be modernised, yes, it might take decisions sometimes with which I don't agree and can be frustrating. But overall in a footloose, fancy-free globalised world where we can't deal with crime that crosses borders, environment that crosses borders, huge trade flows that crosses borders other than by doing it with other countries, we are stronger together and weaker apart”. ‘I'm relishing the opportunity to make that patriotic case.’ Although the European elections are a poor indicator of performance in Westminster elections, there is heightened concern among Tories that a strong showing by Ukip next year will give them renewed momentum going into the general election. Attacks: Ukip leader Nigel Farage dismissed Mr Clegg's remarks as proof the pro-EU establishment are worried . While few expect them to take any . seats at Westminster, many Tories fear that they will draw enough votes . to deny the Conservatives any chance of an overall majority. Ukip . leader Nigel Farage said: ‘These ridiculous comments from Mr Clegg . demonstrate just how worried the pro-EU establishment are becoming. ‘The . news that Paul Sykes will be supporting the UKIP European Election . campaign clearly has them worried and already we're seeing pathetic . attacks of this nature.’ If Tory voters in some areas to Ukip it could make it easier for Labour and the Lib Dems to win crunch seats. Donation: Wealthy businessman Paul Sykes is promising to donate millions to Ukip . Mr Sykes was a backer of the Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s but broke with the party in 1991 over John Major’s stance on the Maastricht Treaty. In 2000 he briefly returned to the Tory fold under William Hague only to be expelled the following year over his hardline views on Europe. He said that he hoped success for Ukip in next year’s election would compel the other parties to accede to calls for an early referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU. Tory support in the North has dropped further and the party is set to fare as badly there as in Scotland, a poll reveals. Its support in the region has dropped from 31 per cent to 29 per cent, with Labour strengthening to 35 per cent. The ICM Wisdom Index asks voters to predict how well a party will do, rather than asking how they will vote. Mr Sykes told LBC Radio he had not voted nationally since 1992, adding: ‘What’s the use? The government of Britain doesn’t reside in Britain. 'I’ve voted in the European elections but the rest are meaningless. They are not going to change the way we are governed. Every day life is controlled from Brussels.’","Deputy Prime Minister tears into Ukip and anti-EU Conservatives .

"Ruben Reyes admitted to murdering three other gang members and burying them in shallow graves . A battle-scared mafia boss known as 'Menace' was arrested after admitting to three grisly murders - and he is also suspected of ordering a hit on a cop. Ruben Reyes confessed to the crimes after becoming the target of a gang hit himself where he was shot once at his apartment. He was arrested by FBI agents in San Antonio, Texas, and made an appearance in federal court yesterday where he provided details about the murders of three other high-ranking members of the Texas Mexican Mafia. An FBI criminal complaint identified the victims as Mark Anthony Bernal, Carlos Chapa and Johnny Solis. Reyes, 36, has been charged with using and discharging a firearm in relation to a violent crime but has not been indicted yet. If convicted, faces between 10 years and life in prison. Reyes is also suspected of ordering a hit on a Balcone Heights police officer who was killed in May, according to KSAT 12. Julian Pesina was fatally shot while off-duty outside a tattoo parlour in San Antonio he co-owned. He was reportedly under investigation for drug activity and linked to the notorious gang. He also had tattoos worn by Texas Mafia Members. On November 9, Reyes was targeted by four masked men and shot once in the back but survived the attack. Reyes is also suspected of ordering a hit on Balcones Heights police officer Julian Pesina, pictured . He contacted the police to report the shooting two days later and revealed information about the unsolved murders. He confessed to homicide detectives that he had murdered all three men and buried their bodies in Pearsall with another gang member. According to the affidavit, he was ordered to kill the men after his gang believed they had 'mishandled' around $60,000 and made 'poor decisions' in day-to-day operations. He said met Mr Chapa at Southpark Mall in January this year and later shot him several times inside a pick-up truck. He then dumped his body in a grave that had already been dug. He shot Mr Bernal in the head several times after luring him to a bar and convincing him to drive him to collect a debt, before taking him to the same grave site as Mr Chapa. Police officer Julian Pesina was fatally shot outside a tattoo parlour in Hillcrest Drive, pictured, San Antonio . Reyes said he murdered Mr Solis after convincing him to take part in a home invasion and shot him in the head. Using the information provided by Reyes, officers later recovered the remains of the victims in shallow graves. A bail hearing is set for next week.","Ruben Reyes admitted killing three fellow gang members and burying them in shallow graves .

"The birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s first child, our future monarch, is an occasion for great joy. But in recent days I have found myself thinking how much Diana would have relished the role of grandmother. In her all too brief time on the world stage, we saw how good she was with children: she had the ability to get into a child’s mind; her wicked sense of fun was infectious; and she could put even the most over-awed child instantly at ease. She proved communication is not just about the spoken word — a look and a caress can be more eloquent than words. Scroll down for video . Iconic picture of Diana as a mother: the Princess of Wales greets her sons Prince William(centre) and Prince Harry (right) on the deck of the yacht Britannia an official visit to Canada . But what people won’t be aware of is how much Diana, with her strong maternal instincts, relished the whole process of pregnancy. Indeed, she embraced any woman she saw who happened to be pregnant. Seeing photographs of the Duchess of Cambridge shopping for baby clothes with her mother made me terribly sad that Diana wasn’t around to be part of the ritual and fun of the run-up to the birth. I experienced how much she enjoyed this at first hand when I became pregnant at the relatively late age of 38. I had met Diana only the month before I conceived through our mutual friend, the then Brazilian ambassador’s wife, Lucia Flecha de Lima. The life and soul: a drenched Princess Diana with Princes Harry (centre) and William on the Loggers Leap Ride at Thorpe Park in 1997 . Devoted to her boys: Diana with William (left) and Harry, joined by nanny Olga Powell in the background in Lech, Austria . When I was seven months pregnant, I was invited to Kensington Palace to have lunch with Diana. She had been following my pregnancy closely and had been full of practical advice. But the reason for this lunch invitation became clear as soon as I had sat down. ‘What shopping have you done for the baby?’ she demanded. ‘Nothing yet,’ I replied. ‘I’m busy at work.’ I was working full-time as CEO of Tiffany & Co in London. Diana got up from the table, went to her writing desk and came back with a two-page type-written list of everything I would require — the same list she had used for her own two babies. She still had it, even though William was by then nine and Harry seven. Another baby for Diana: the princess leaving hospital with Prince Harry, 16 September 1984 (pictured left) and posing for a formal family picture with Prince William a month later . She told me firmly that I needed to ‘get organised’. Yes, Ma’am! A few weeks later, Diana rang me at work and said she was going to take me in hand, as she assumed — rightly — that I still hadn’t been anywhere near a baby shop. She gave me a date and told me to bring my list. A few days later she collected me from Tiffany’s headquarters and rushed me off to Mothercare in Kensington (since closed down, unfortunately). Diana was a whirlwind of efficiency, sweeping items off the shelves and into our trolley — things I had never even heard of, let alone understood what they could possibly be for. Charles and Diana with baby Prince William in Auckland, North Island, New Zealand in 1983. Diana insisted William travel with the couple abroad . The shop assistant was flustered at the till as Diana handed over her credit card. Indeed, I think it was one of the first times she had used it, rather than paying in cash, and she was rather excited about it. As we left, struggling to walk under mounds of baby equipment, the shop door alarm went off because, in her confusion, the assistant had forgotten to remove one of the security tags. So, we had to stagger back to the till, causing still more confusion — and stares of amazement from other mothers-to-be. It was hilarious. Full of fun: here Diana is pictured with her sons, Harry in the middle and William on the right, in the garden of Highgrove House in Gloucestershire, 1986. William is wearing a Dallas Cowboys t-shirt . When we finally collapsed into  the  car, Diana consulted her list once more. ‘Don’t worry about a pram,’  she said. ‘You can borrow mine — and I can give you William’s  Moses basket.’ A few days later, a vast Silver Cross pram was delivered to our house, with the Moses basket inside. Diana’s attentions didn’t end there. About three weeks before I was due, she came round to tea. She knew I was edgy and within minutes asked me what was wrong. I promptly burst into tears and admitted I was scared: that I was the sort of woman who could run Tiffany’s, but had no idea how I would cope with having a child, let alone the ghastly (in my eyes) process of giving birth. A protective hand: Diana carries her son, Prince Harry, off a flight at Aberdeen Airport . She calmed me down and then organised a session for me with birthing guru Betty Parsons, who had advised Diana during her pregnancies. This terrifying but wonderful woman, then in her late 70s, arrived at my house a few days later. She taught me breathing techniques and tried to show me how to relax. I can still hear Diana roaring with . laughter when I told her how Betty had bossed around my husband, . Dominic, as soon as he walked through the front door. My . first daughter, Savannah, was born just before Christmas. I was still . in the delivery room when I  was told by a nurse that Diana was on the . phone. The next morning a beautiful china pot arrived full of plants, with a note saying: ‘To Rosa, just the biggest hurrah possible.’ She was round the next day to have a cuddle — with the baby, obviously. After Prince William's birth in 1982 at Buckingham Palace: The Queen (seated left), Diana, The Queen Mother, and Prince Charles and the Duke of Edinburgh (standing) As soon as I arrived, Diana would meet me halfway down the stairs, scoop up Savannah and take over.  When my second daughter, Domenica, was born two-and-a-half years later, Diana again came to  the fore. Domenica was very weak in the first months of her life because she had Down’s syndrome, with added complications. Diana would visit my house in Bayswater, West London, and just sit with her to give me a break. She came with me to hospital appointments and asked questions of the medics when I was incapable of doing so. She had a tenderness that was extraordinary to witness. Today, as I think of William and Catherine’s new baby, I remember how Diana was with my two daughters. How she would appear at bath-time, turn up at birthday parties and invite us all to lunch at Kensington Palace so she could play with them. She encouraged Savannah to do ballet, showed her the basic moves and lay down on the floor with her to do stretches. Diana gave her a pair of ballet shoes signed by the stars of the Kirov ballet, which, 16 years later, still hang on her bedroom wall. We should not forget that Diana’s first job was as a nursery school teacher. It had been clear even then that she was wonderful with children and, indeed, it was the only part of her life in which she had complete confidence. It makes it seem all the more cruel she has been denied the pleasure of being with her grandson. This much-awaited baby will, I am sure, be the cause of national celebration. The birth of their first son will only increase worldwide interest in the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as they move from being a couple to becoming a family. Diana’s legacy, which until now has lain with her sons, will extend to a new generation. Diana was made to be a mother. Her nurturing instinct was the best part of her character. She would have been the most magnificent grandmother and it makes me ineffably sad she will not be a part of the royal baby’s life. But, of course, my feelings are as nothing to those that Prince William will experience. One thing is certain for me, however. No matter how much Carole Middleton involves herself in the birth and early years of her first grandchild, her attentions could not be greater than those Diana would have provided.","In her all too brief time, we saw how good she was with children .

"In the closing stages of this game, we were on familiar territory. Manchester United were close to victory and were exerting pressure. One shot was saved by the Burnley goalkeeper while another was hacked from the line. It could have been 4-1. Half an hour earlier, however, things were very different. Here was the real picture of this dispiriting night for the biggest club in English football. Back then – early in the second half – the United lead was 2-1 and they were firmly on the back foot, where they had been most of the night. Chris Smalling rises above the Burnley defence to score United's second goal on Wednesday night . Wayne Rooney – playing as a defensive midfielder – was being booked for persistent fouling and United were being booed by a small section of the Old Trafford crowd. They were not booing individual players, though some of them may have deserved it. No, they were showing their displeasure at something much worse. They were booing the style – the nature – of their team’s play. It wasn’t everybody in the ground – far from it – and it didn’t last long. But it was unmistakably there. It was there as United broke away and then, with a numerical overload beckoning, started to funnel the ball backwards towards the halfway line. It was there again, minutes later, when Rooney turned and played a free-kick from opposition territory back in to his own half.

CLICK HERE for all the stats, goals - including Chris Smalling's second goal (above) - and heat maps from Old Trafford . Over the years, we have seen just about everything at this great stadium. Most of it good, some of it not so. This, though, was almost unprecedented. United being outpassed, outplayed, outrun and outthought by a team that began the game in 19th place in the Barclays Premier League. Burnley were fantastic. Their midfield was superior all night, Michael Kightly emerging as the star. Particularly in the first half they threatened to take United apart. They dominated possession, created chances and scored a very good goal. Somehow, however, the Lancashire team ended the half a goal down. United managed to bookend the opening 45 minutes with set piece goals for Chris Smalling. In between those goals, however, there was only one team playing any football. Right from the start, Burnley were at it and United weren't. In the very first minute, former United central defender Michael Keane headed wide from a corner when it looked easier to score. We presumed it would be a rare offensive movement but we were wrong. We should have known better. Soon after, Phil Jones went off injured and Smalling came on. Within 21 seconds he scored. Daley Blind was also forced off injured in the first half after a clash of heads and replaced by Herrera . Smalling was caught out as Burnley striker Danny Ings was left unmarked to head the equaliser in the 12th minute . Ings peeled away from Smalling to convert a cross from Kieran Trippier in the 12th minute . A super volley from Patrick McNair was saved but when the corner arrived, a spot of head tennis saw Radamel Falcao nod the ball across for Smalling who gave United the lead with his very first touch. Momentarily that seemed to settle United. They had an early lead and, historically, that has meant only one thing. On this occasion, though, against this United team, Burnley merely steeled themselves and proceeded to dominate the game for the next half an hour. Within the first 15 minutes of the game they created four clear chances. Ings' 12th minute header to equalise was a beauty, the striker peeling subtlely away from Smalling to convert a cross from Kieran Trippier. As well as that, Kightly broke down the left and made David de Gea save, an Ings shot from a corner hit his own player almost on the goal line and a curling effort from Ashley Barnes missed by a foot. For a while it was embarrassing for United. Kightly was running the game, dumping Robin van Persie on his backside to steal possession one moment and nut megging Rooney to dart in to the penalty area the next. At the other end, Falcao and Van Persie were awful. Neither could hold the ball up. Neither found space. Smalling leapt above former United defender Keane to head his team back into the lead . Smalling became the first substitute to score a first-half brace in Premier League history . A Smalling mistake gifted a great chance to Ings just after half-time but he failed to convert from eight yards . Robin van Persie sealed victory from the spot after Angel di Maria had been upended by Scott Arfield . Relief all round after another unconvincing display by Manchester United at Old Trafford .

Ultimately, though, Burnley didn’t score another goal and just as a patient home crowd were beginning to despair, United broke away to edge back in front. Rooney and Angel Di Maria worked a short corner on the right and when the South American crossed to the far post Smalling leapt above Keane to head his team back in to a most unlikely lead. Certainly it was tempting to wonder where the game would go from here. Would United take something from the fact they were ahead and go on to play some football? Or would Burnley continue to forage forwards in search of a reward they knew was there for them? The first few minutes of the second half told its own story. George Boyd eased down the right for Burnley and when he crossed, Smalling and Anders Herrera – on in place of injured Daley Blind – got in each other’s way to present Ings with a straight forward chance. Ings should have buried it. It was in his territory. This time, though, he hesitated and then contributed a poor first touch. That gave De Gea the chance to block at his feet and the rebound then flew over. Maybe that was the decisive moment of the game. Had Burnley scored at that point, United may have fallen apart. The crowd reacted impatiently. They knew what they were watching, they recognised the signs of a team mired in uncertainty, welded fast to a formation they aren’t uncomfortable with. Rooney’s role was remarkable. Pushed backwards by Blind’s exit, England’s captain and most prolific modern goal scorer spent his night so far away from the opposition net it was a wonder he could even see it. Bit by bit, minute by minute, in this rare atmosphere, United somehow edged towards a most unlikely victory. Di Maria appealed for one penalty and then finally won one in the 81st minute. Burnley – clearly tiring – lost possession from their own corner and when Di Maria broke, Scott Arfield took him down and Van Persie converted the penalty. At strange night, a strange result. Van Gaal called it a “lucky win” and on this occasion he didn’t need any pieces of paper to convince us he was right.

"Indian cricket authorities have been forced to back down after a spokesman made an insensitive remark about cancelling a tour game because of felled batsman Phillip Hughes. A practice tour match between India and Australia was set to be held today and Indian officials initially refused to postpone the match after Hughes, 25, collapsed on the pitch on Tuesday. In a disrespectful remark, a spokesman for the Board of Control for Cricket in India had told The Daily Telegraph: 'Postponed because of one player? I don't think so.' But the team backed down on Thursday after learning that Hughes was on death's door, defusing a potentially explosive decision out of respect for the family and friends of the cricketer. Scroll down for video . Phillip Hughes, 25, died in St Vincent's Hospital on Thursday, two days after he copped a sickening blow to the back of his neck . Indian players warm up during a training session in Adelaide earlier this week . Members of local cricket teams gathered in Kolkata to observe a moment of silence for felled cricketer Phillip Hughes, prior to a game on Thursday evening . Here in the city of Karachi in neighbouring Pakistan, cricket fans lit candles to pay tribute to Phillip Hughes in a beautiful vigil to the passed Australian player . Flowers and notes stacked up outside the Grace Gates at the Lord's Cricket Ground overnight . The Australian flag flew at half-mast at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday night. Hughes' copped a sickening blow to the back of his neck on the hallowed Australian pitch on Tuesday evening . In a separate incident, Sydney Morning Herald columnist Ben Pobjie was savaged by newspapers and readers alike when he used the tragedy to stick the boot into Prime Minister Tony Abbott in a misguided tweet. 'Sean Abbott hits Phil Hughes in the head, continuing the tradition of Abbotts f***ing up Australia,' he tweeted. Pobjie later said he tweeted 'before it was known Hughes was seriously injured' and deleted the insensitive message after the situation became clear. The Fairfax columnist came under attack on Twitter after the remarks. He later apologised . Flowers were left at the gates of the Sydney Cricket Ground to commemorate the young cricketer's life . More floral tributes - and an Australian baggy green cap - lay out the front of Lord's Cricket Ground in London . Many placed their cricket bats out the front of their homes in a special tribute to Phillip Hughes. Above, the bats of a father and son sit outside a family home . 'I’m not going to say anything more about it, because right now all anyone should be doing is thinking of Phil and his loved ones,' he said. Cricket Australia chief James Sutherland will hold a press conference at 10:30am AEDT on Friday morning. An update is expected on whether the Test against India will go ahead next week, given the devastated state of so many Australian players. Touching pictures emerged from the sub-continent on Friday morning of two Indian teams gathering in respect of Hughes prior to a match in Kolkata.","Practice tour match that was to be held today has been canned out of respect .

"In the wake of the powerful terror blast that killed over 60 people across the border in Pakistan recently, a comprehensive security mechanism has been put in place by the Border Security Force (BSF) for the flag-lowering ceremony at the Attari-Wagah border. The mechanism includes special anti-sabotage measures. “We have taken a number of measures to enhance security at the Attari-Wagah retreat ceremony venue on our side after the blast that occurred early this month. A comprehensive security zone has been created,” BSF Director General D.K. Pathak said. A comprehensive security mechanism has been put in place for the flag-lowering ceremony . Officials said the BSF has now entrusted the Punjab Police with the security and sanitisation of the venue for about a kilometre, apart from enhancing its security protocols inside and outside the viewers’ gallery. Punjab Police has been asked to conduct special anti-sabotage checks of the area around the gallery. Besides this, in order to plug loopholes along the porous and unfenced borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh, India will soon set up a ‘smart fence’ mechanism as part of an over Rs 4,500-crore modernisation plan being implemented by BSF. The country's largest border guarding force, with over 2.5 lakh personnel under its command, has recently begun the trial of these sophisticated and technical smart fencing systems in a four-km stretch in Jammu and Punjab sectors, where fencing with barbed wire is not possible due to difficult topography or inclement weather. The BSF, in a maiden initiative, is also undertaking an ambitious upgrade of its surveillance equipment, guns and artillery to effectively secure over 7,000- km border on the western and eastern flanks of the country. “We need to upgrade and modernise everything... Right from our weaponry and communication devices, to the infrastructure. We have a modernisation plan and budget of over Rs 4,500 crore which will run for a five-year period,” Pathak said. At present about 15 per cent of the Indo-Pak border and about 35 per cent of the Indo-Bangladesh frontier is unfenced. Officials said the force is procuring a smart 'motion sensor alarm’ which alerts border guards in case there is a movement along the unfenced stretch of the frontier which is located in difficult terrain. A similar laser-guided gadget is being put to test to detect hidden tunnels in border areas and undulating land.",Move follows a suicide bomb attack that killed over 60 on the Pakistani side .
"Disgruntled: Landlord Donald Zucker, 83, took a tree vendor to court for selling trees before December 1 . It seems the Christmas cheer isn't here quite yet. A real estate mogul has taken a Christmas tree vendor to court for selling trees on the sidewalk outside his Manhattan building before December 1. Landlord Donald Zucker, 83, griped that Evergreen Stand started selling trees outside his building on 15th Street and Sixth Avenue on November 24 - hogging parking spots and clogging up foot traffic. But when the Wisconsin-based company did not take down its stand, Zucker took them to court to enforce a city code that prohibits the sale of trees before December 1. 'Unless the Evergreen Stand is immediately stopped, defendants will continue to mount Christmas trees on the stand, making removal of the trees extremely difficult,' he said in the suit, which was reported in the New York Post. Zucker, who lives on Long Island, did not return a request for comment but Zucker's attorney said his client brought the suit after complaints from residents in the building at 77 West 15th Street. He added that the Christmas tree company needs the landlord's permission to sell its wares in front of his building. The suit was withdrawn on Wednesday because the owners of the stand could not be tracked down to defend their business, but the landlord vowed to fight them again next year, the Post reported. Scene: He said that residents at his building on 15th Street and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, pictured, had complained that the vendor was taking up parking spots and blocking the sidewalk . Zucker, who has multiple properties across Long Island and in Midtown according to records, served in advisory positions under New York City Mayors Ed Koch and Rudy Giuliani. The code he referenced states that Christmas trees must only be sold on the streets from December 1. It arose in 1938, when then-mayor Fiorello La Guardia demanded street vendors have a license. Many were immigrants and the paperwork was often impossible to get through. But when members of the public complained that they could not buy Christmas trees on the streets anymore, the City Council passed a law - the 'coniferous tree' exception. The case was eventually thrown out because the vendor of the stand (file pictured) could not be found . It says 'storekeepers and peddlers may sell and display coniferous trees during the month of December' on a city sidewalk without a permit. The only issue for Evergreen Stand is that the code states that vendor must also get the permission of the owners fronting the sidewalk - in this case the landlord - and keep a walkway open for pedestrians.","Donald Zucker, 83, has taken Evergreen Stand to court for blocking up the sidewalk outside his building on 15th Street after his tenants complained .

"Manchester City have identified Southampton's on-loan central defender Toby Alderweireld as a summer transfer target. The 25-year-old Belgian is currently at Southampton on a season-long loan from Atletico Madrid and had made 16 appearances for Ronald Koeman's high-flying team before injuring his hamstring in the win at Manchester United early in January. Southampton have a £6.8million option on Alderweireld but it's understood Atletico may well use a clause in the deal that stipulates they can essentially pay £1.5m to cancel that and then sell the player to the highest bidder. Toby Alderweireld has been in impressive form since joining Southampton on loan from Atletico Madrid . The 25-year-old, in action against Chelsea in December, is a summer transfer target for Manchester City . Alderweireld went off injured against Arsenal last month, subsequently ruling him out of action for a month . City are still looking for defensive reinforcements as coach Manuel Pellegrini has not yet found the perfect partner for captain Vincent Kompany. Both Martin Demichelis and Eliaquim Mangala have been given opportunities but have so far not done enough to convince anybody at the Etihad Stadium that they can help take City to the next level, particularly in Europe. Alderweireld's wages may also be prohibitive for Southampton if they were to get involved in an auction for the player. It now remains to be seen if City follow up their interest or not. Meanwhile, City are preparing for next week's Champions League tie against Barcelona with the Spanish club back on form after their earlier difficulties this season.

'Fortunately, after our poor start to the year everything changed for us. 'We are now in a different dynamic and everything is going in the right direction. 'The team has confidence and there is a different attitude and a lot of determination. 'That is the reason why we are today where we are. We face City just as we did last year and it's a team that has a lot of great players. 'It's going to be a really difficult tie. We expect a level tie and it will be decided by details.

"Passengers could soon see the end of liquid limits at airports thanks to an innovative new scanner. The award-winning technology is currently on trial at Heathrow and Gatwick airports in London and 63 airports in Europe and Australia, where it is playing a vital role in allowing passengers to eventually carry standard containers for drinks, cosmetics and toiletries. With the aim of stopping threats and speeding up queues, the table-top machine uses a laser to analyse the liquid contents of bottles – without opening them – for bomb ingredients at airport security checkpoints. Scroll down for video . Limits: Plane passengers are currently restricted to 100ml limits on liquids in hand luggage . Award-winning technology: The scanner uses a laser to analyse the liquid contents of containers . Cobalt Light System' scanners are currently on trial at 65 airports, including Heathrow and Gatwick in London . The machine has been developed by Oxfordshire-based company Cobalt Light Systems, which is in discussions with the US government about the technology, said CEO Paul Loeffen. Air travellers are currently banned from carrying liquids over 100ml in their hand baggage, and the smaller containers must be placed in clear plastic bags. It leads to extra delays for those who fail to prepare ahead of time and more waste as many travellers are forced to throw out full containers that are too large. The rule was implemented in 2006 after authorities foiled a terror plot to use liquid explosives to blow up several aircraft travelling from Heathrow to the US and Canada. It is the European Commission’s goal to lift the ban and screen all liquids, lotions, powders and gels by January 2016 using technology such as Cobalt’s Insight100. The company’s liquid explosive detection system is able to scan containers up to three litres in size, and its new Insight100M version allows airport screeners to inspect metallic containers. Cobalt says the chemical analysis is rapid and accurate, and its reliability reduces delays and costs associated with missed flights, confiscations and extra security personnel. He told MailOnline Travel: ‘It’s part of the solution towards the legislation that is aiming to lift the restrictions on carrying liquids into cabin baggage over the next few years. Future uses? Cobalt says the scanner could one day be used for non-invasive cancer screening . Passengers are currently banned from carrying liquids over 100ml in their hand baggage . The Insight100 uses a laser to determine the chemical composition of liquids in containers up to three litres in size without opening them. It uses a technique called Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical make-up of a liquid by analysing scattered light and recognising patterns made by different materials. The scanner works by firing a laser into the liquid at different angles. A small proportion of light penetrates the surface of the liquid and bounces back to give the scanner data. It then subtracts data about the container from the overall reading to leave it with a faint signal from the liquid. It cross-checks the remaining information with a library of dangerous liquids. And all this takes just five seconds. The machine is able to separate harmless ingredients from those like hydrogen peroxide that can be used to make bombs. ‘It’s only part of the solution but it enables ultimately passengers to carry liquids in the way they used to do prior to 2006.’ The false alarm rate at the 65 airports is less than one per cent and the average scan time is three seconds or less. Mr Loeffen said the false alarm rate is key because erroneous scans can lead to delays. The £40,000 device has earned Cobalt widespread praise and attention, and led to growth within the firm. Earlier this year, Cobalt received the MacRobert Award from the Royal Academy of Engineering, the UK’s premier engineering prize. And there are plans to use the technology for other purposes. In addition to identifying liquid explosives, Cobalt said the machine could one day be used for non-invasive cancer screening or detecting narcotics, precursors and toxic chemicals, and counterfeit products.","Award-winning technology was created by Cobalt Light Systems .

"Some statistics can be misleading, such as the one that says Manchester United have lost only once in their last 17 matches. To the casual football watcher, it’s a run of results that should hint at progress. So, too, should their position in the Barclays Premier League. United are fourth, only five points behind champions Manchester City. But things are not always as they seem and anybody who has paid any attention to United’s play this season will know that any progress under Louis van Gaal has been hewn from organisation and sheer stubbornness rather than the progressive, fluent football for which the club have always claimed to be known. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney cut a frustrated figure during Sunday's 1-1 draw with West Ham . Man United goalkeeper David de Gea (right) shouting in anger after West Ham took the lead at Upton Park . Louis van Gaal watches on as the Red Devils struggled to a late point against West Ham on Sunday afternoon . CLICK HERE to read the stats that shame Louis van Gaal's stuttering Manchester United . Last Friday — two days before the ill-deserved point taken from a game at West Ham on Sunday - Van Gaal poignantly referenced the spirit of Munich. ‘We look for flair and pace and passion to play the game the United way,’ said Van Gaal, borrowing a line from a poem written to commemorate the 1958 disaster. Suffice to say that after another stilted United performance at Upton Park, that search goes on. Daley Blind rescued Manchester United with a strike deep into injury-time on Sunday . Rooney and defender Phil Jones trudge off the Upton Park field after Van Gaal's side salvaged a late leveller . You have to wonder what former winger Ryan Giggs, now assistant manager, makes of the change at United . One qualified observer described Sunday’s United display as ‘joyless’. It seemed appropriate. More worrying for Van Gaal, though, is the fact that the coterie of ex-players and United legends still close to matters at Old Trafford are beginning to whisper their concerns, too. This is one of the things about United. It is similar to Liverpool in that once you have played there you never quite let go. Once a red, always a red. As such, those with their ear to the ground are worth listening to and the consensus is that Van Gaal’s team simply cannot continue to play like this if they wish to be afforded the patience and understanding the coach has admitted the team still need. ‘They are just so boring to watch,’ said one former player last week. That is a generalisation but occasionally it is hard to disagree. Man United striker Robin van Persie is crowded out as the Dutchman attempts to move forward with the ball . West Ham midfielder Kevin Nolan celebrating on the line after the Hammers took the lead on 49 minutes . West Ham players  congratulating goalscorer Cheikhou Kouyate (centre) after the midfielder found the net . The saving graces for United right now are clear but their hold on them is not. The fact United are in the Champions League places and ahead of Liverpool is important. They are fortunate to be fourth with the points tally that they have but, nevertheless, they do remain on course for achieving the principal objective given Van Gaal when he joined the club in the summer. Whether they continue to play this way and remain in the top four remains to be seen. Comparisons have already been made with Van Gaal’s predecessor David Moyes but the up-to-date numbers are worth revealing - and they do not reflect well on this United team. After 24 league games of a season that was ended by his dismissal last April, Moyes had taken four points fewer than Van Gaal. He had, however, won the same number of games – 12 - and his team had managed more shots on goal, on and off target, and forced more corners. This points to flaws in Van Gaal’s use of his players. Moyes’s team were hardly heralded as one welded fast to United’s best traditions yet it would appear that they spent more time threatening the opposition goal than the team we are watching this time round. On social media on Sunday Van Gaal’s United were being criticised heavily by their own supporters. Chief among the concerns were the manager’s continued belief in a three-man defence - though that seems to be wavering - his use of captain Wayne Rooney in midfield, the refusal to use Ander Herrera at all and the relatively lethargic recent performances of record signing Angel di Maria. United skipper Rooney, playing in a midfield role, is challenged by Nolan as Alex Song watches on close by . United captain Rooney, pictured reacting next to Mark Clattenburg, struggled to ignite his team's play . All of these would appear to be part of the problem. United have no real pace, so do not counter-attack consistently well, something that has always been part of the DNA at Old Trafford. Equally, United do not keep possession for long spells in the right areas, and so fail to build pressure as well as they might. ‘It’s not a question of playing with wingers or without or with three defenders or four defenders, it’s about the playing style,’ said Van Gaal on Friday. ‘Certainly, at the moment we could have done better in terms of ball possession.’ Striker Radamel Falcao (centre) struggled to impress up front for Manchester United against West Ham . Summer signing Angel di Maria (left) also struggled to make an impact in the Manchester United midfield . Criticism of United’s use of Marouane Fellaini as a target man for long passes late on Sunday seems unfair. It worked, and was also a tactic Van Gaal used successfully to turn round Holland’s World Cup last-16 game against Mexico in Fortaleza last summer. Comparisons with his Dutch team are interesting, though. They were a pragmatic bunch, too. After the exhilaration of an opening victory against Spain in Brazil, Holland’s football was short on flair but that squad did not have the attacking talent that this United side possess and it is tempting to wonder what Ryan Giggs makes of it all. Under Moyes, he grew exasperated at what he saw as a refusal to play on the front foot. Moyes’s perceived failure to use wide players well also frustrated the most famous winger Old Trafford has ever seen, yet Giggs is now assistant to a man who in certain areas again views the game differently. One of Giggs’s prime roles is to talk United’s players - and Van Gaal - through the strengths and weaknesses of the next opposition. On Tuesday the opponents are Burnley and during his preparation, Van Gaal’s assistant will have noticed one thing: Burnley are the only Premier League side to have played more long passes than United this season.

"Devoted couple: George Pitman, 77,  pictured with his wife Pat,77, died of a broken heart within hours of his spouse . A devoted husband died of a broken heart just hours after telling his dying wife 'just close your eyes, I'm coming with you.' In a scene that could have come straight out of a Hollywood movie George Pitman peacefully slipped away less than 24 hours after saying goodbye to his beloved wife of 55 years. The doting great grandfather, who was seriously ill himself, kept a week long vigil at the hospital bedside of his wife, Pat, after she was admitted with a shadow on her lung. Nurses were forced to prepare a bed for the retired lorry driver alongside his 77-year-old spouse after he ignored their pleas to go to a different hospital for treatment. Mr Pitman held his wife's hand and whispered 'Close your eyes, I'm coming with you,' as she slipped away. Just 21 hours later, he had died of a broken heart after suffering an aneurysm in his chest. 'They spent their whole lives inseparable, so this is what they would have wanted,' said their eldest daughter Jacqueline Gofton, 55. 'If they had been given a choice, this is the one they would have chosen. Dad died of a broken heart.It is just unbelievable how this has happened.' Mrs Pitman was admitted to the University Hospital of North Tees, Cleveland, on November 13 after medics detected a shadow on her lung. Despite being told he was critically ill, George refused to go to James Cook Hospital, 10 miles away in Middlesbrough. Poignantly, a few hours before he passed away, at around 1pm on November 20, George asked the nurse treating him what her name was. 'She said it was Patricia, but she got called Pat,' said Mrs Gofton. 'Dad said that was a lovely name, and he seemed relaxed after that as though it was a comfort to him. 'It was as if Mam had been sent to nurse him.' United in death: George Pitman whispered to his wife of 55 years 'Close your eyes, I'm coming,' as she slipped away . The husband and wife from Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire,  met on a blind date and married on Valentine's Day 1959 . The inseparable couple met on a blind date and married on Valentine's Day 1959. 'After they met, dad had to go to Hong Kong for his national service,' said their second child,  Angela Gould, 53. 'He was from West Bromwich, but he was based at Catterick and came to Hartlepool with his friend on a blind date. 'When he came back from Hong Kong after two years, he came straight back for her. He'd written to her every week and sent presents. 'They really were inseparable, they were never apart. It seems fitting that they even died together.' The couple had five children, Jacqueline, Angela Gould, 53, Deborah Willis, 51, 50-year-old Paul and Gillian Cormack, 47, along with 14 grandchildren and 10 great grandchildren. The family are now preparing to say goodbye to the couple at a joint funeral. Mrs Gofton said: 'In circumstances like this I always thought you could ask your mam what you should do, or your dad if it was the other way around. 'But we have lost them both. It's as if they knew though. 'When we came back to their house the next day, Dad had put a box on the bed with all of the birth certificates in and all of the legal documents. 'They were young at heart, they adored their grand kids and spent three nights a week down at the bowls club having a couple of drinks and playing bingo.' The couple spent their whole lives together and were described as  'inseparable' by their children .","George Pitman, 77, died less than 24 hours after his wife, Pat, passed away .

"It sounds like something more reminiscent of a James Bond film than real life. When police officers attempted to arrest the man accused of being one of the world's biggest internet pirates at his multi-million pound mansion, things were a bit trickier than they might have expected. Instead of giving himself up easily, Kim Dotcom refused to let the police in, activated a number of locking mechanisms in his sprawling home and then hid in a safe room. James Bond hideaway: Kim Dotcom's sprawling mansion in Coatesville, north west of Auckland, can be seen in this image. Police today revealed the extraordinary details behind the arrest of the multi-millionaire . Secure: Dozens of police officers, backed by helicopters, had to force their way into the mansion after Mr Dotcom refused to let them in. He then activated locking mechanisms and hid in a safe room . The determined police officers had to cut their way through to gain access and then found Mr Dotcom hiding near a gun. Fortunately, thanks to dozens of police officers, backed by helicopters, they managed to detain the 38-year-old without anyone coming to harm. Mr Dotcom, a German national, was one of four men arrested on Friday as part of an investigation of the Megaupload.com . website. The group has been accused of engaging in a . scheme that took more than $500 million away from copyright holders and . generated over $175 million in proceeds from subscriptions and . advertising. The extraordinary details behind the arrest were revealed by police in New Zealand today. Detective Inspector Grant Wormald, from the Organised and Financial Crime Agency, said: 'Despite our staff clearly identifying themselves, Mr Dotcom retreated into the house and activated a number of electronic-locking mechanisms.' Damage: A broken intercom system can be seen in this image after the police raid at Dotcom Mansion . Held: Kim Dotcom, formerly known as Kim Schmitz . and also known as Kim Tim Jim Vestor, was arrested along with three . other executives of Megauploads . Officers were forced to break the locks but soon realised that Mr Dotcom had barricaded himself into the safe room. 'Once they gained entry into this room, they found Mr Dotcom near a firearm which had the appearance of a shortened shotgun,' said Mr Wormald. 'It was definitely not as simple as knocking at the front door.' Two firearms were seized and a 55-year-old New Zealand man has since been charged with illegal possession of a pistol. Computers and documents were also retrieved and more than $8 million was seized from financial institutions. Luxury: The property has a number of locking mechanisms and a safe room . Confiscated: Tow trucks wait to remove vehicles from Kim Dotcom's house . Television footage showed vehicles, including a pink Cadillac and a Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe, being removed from the property. The house where Mr Dotcom - also . known as Kim Schmitz -was arrested was one of the largest and most expensive in the country, worth around NZ$30 million. Located in hills northwest of New Zealand's largest city, the mansion is surrounded - at suitably discreet distances - by other substantial country homes and luxury lifestyle blocks complete with stables, swimming pools and tennis courts. Mr Dotcom leased the property after being blocked from buying it last year by the government after failing to meet a 'good character' test for migrants, although he was granted residency in 2010. He has previous convictions for insider trading and embezzlement from his time in Germany and Thailand, according to immigration authorities, leading some opposition politicians to question why he was allowed to settle in the first place. 'New Zealand is under the radar, away from Interpol and a better lifestyle than Eastern Europe,' said Jeffrey Carr, an Internet security expert. Seized: A number of cars belonging to Kim Dotcom including this pink Cadillac were taken away by authorities . Time to go: Others cars including a collection of Mercedes vehicles were removed from Kim Dotcom's home . 'They obviously weren't aware how closely the FBI has been building its international relationships over the past few years.' The FBI said Mr Dotcom personally made $42 million from Megaupload in 2010 alone. Standing 6ft 7Inches tall, Mr Dotcom appeared to revel in his outlaw reputation.

Lawmakers stopped anti-piracy legislation on Friday, postponing a critical vote in a victory for Internet companies that staged a mass online protest against the fast-moving bills. The movie and music industries want Congress to crack down on Internet piracy and content theft, but major Internet companies like Google and Facebook have complained that current drafts of the legislation would lead to censorship.

U.S. Justice Department officials have said that the estimate of $500 million in economic harm to copyright holders cited in a U.S. indictment was at the low end. The allegations included copyright infringement as well as conspiracy to commit copyright infringement, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to commit racketeering. Two of the offences carry a maximum penalty of 20 years. The companies charged, Megaupload Ltd and Vestor Ltd, were both registered in Hong Kong and owned either in large part or solely by Mr Dotcom. About 100 officers raided four premises in Hong Kong on Friday including luxury hotel rooms, seizing computer equipment and freezing $42.5 million in financial assets, according to Hong Kong Customs. Megaupload has boasted of having more than 150 million registered users and 50 million daily visitors, according to the indictment.

Users could upload material to the company's sites which then would create a link that could be distributed. The sites, which included video, music and pornography, did not provide search capabilities but rather relied on others to publish the links, the U.S. indictment said. Megaupload's U.S. lawyer said the company would 'vigorously defend itself' and was trying to recover its servers and get back online. The Megaupload group used more than 1,500 computer servers in Virginia, Washington D.C., France and the Netherlands to host its sites, according to the FBI.","Kim Dotcom one of four men arrested as part of investigation into  Megaupload website .

"A walk in Goodison Park for Everton and disaster for Liverpool in Turkey. All in all, a good night for Everton in the Europa League. The celebrations in the stands here that greeted news of Liverpool's failure in Istanbul were extraordinary. Didn't these two clubs used to be friends? Nevertheless, as far as Roberto Martinez was concerned, the important stuff was happening on the pitch in front of him and after an early scare his team eased past their opposition from Switzerland as easily as they had in the first leg. Romelu Lukaku celebrates his double in front of the Goodison Park home fans having helped secure a Europa League last 16 berth . Lukaku equalised on the night with this penalty after Steven Naismith was hacked down in the box by Young Boys keeper Marco Wolfli . Kevin Mirallas latched onto a brilliant long ball through ball from Darron Gibson to put Everton 3-1 up by the first-half break . Mirallas celebrates having given Roberto Martinez's side a 3-1 lead in the Europa League last 32 second-leg at Goodison Park on Thursday . EVERTON (4-3-3): Howard 6; Coleman 6, Alcaraz 6, Jagielka 6, Garbutt 7; McCarthy 6 (Besic 61, 6), Gibson 7, Barry 6; Mirallas 6, Lukaku 8 (Kone 48, 6), Naismith 7 (Osman, 80) Subs not used: Robles, Baines, Barkley, Browning .

There was plenty of good news here for the Everton manager. Young Boys started well, took the lead through Sekou Sanogo Junior and then struck the crossbar. Wobbly moments indeed for the home team but once Romelu Lukaku equalised from the penalty spot 10 minutes later everything changed. The Belgian scored again five minutes later - a super goal that one - before his international team-mate Kevin Mirallas raced clear on to a Darron Gibson pass to extend the lead and make sure any hopes of a comeback from Young Boys were finally extinguished. The opposition during this tie has been limited. The Swiss league is a poor one. Nevertheless, Everton do seem to be regaining a little confidence and if Martinez takes anything from Thursday night apart from an expected victory, it will be that. Lukaku was terrific until he was replaced early in the second period after feeling a twinge in his thigh. Mirallas, too, had a good night and could have scored again after half-time while young full-back Luke Garbutt impressed on the left hand side. All Martinez has to do now is make sure his team take some of this form in to the Barclays Premier League. This weekend they face Arsenal. 'I am very pleased,' said Martinez. 'The climate around the club will be good now. The domestic competition is vital to us and we know what we have to put right.' Everton began firmly on the front foot, with Lukaku causing some trouble down the right. However as soon as the Swiss team got a foothold in the game they scored. A corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty area and when Raphael Nuzzolo's shot was headed goal wards by Milan Volotic, Tim Howard did well to save. The Everton goalkeeper - not in the best of form of late - could only push the ball in to Sanogo Junior's path, though, and he prodded the ball in to the goal from six yards.

With such a healthy advantage in the tie, Everton should not have panicked. But they did and when Scott Sutter headed the next corner against the Everton bar the home team looked to be in all kinds of trouble. Another goal at that early stage and who knows what would have happened a team so low on confidence. However, minutes later Everton got the break they needed when they won a penalty. It was the decisive moment of the night. Lukaku's role in the whole affair was crucial as first he played a cute ball through to Steven Naismith and, when the goalkeeper brought the Scot down, the big Belgian beat Marco Wolfli low to his right. In an instant Everton went from looking rather shaky indeed to scoring a second goal that not only extended their aggregate lead but showcased the type of football they can play under Martinez.

A combination between Gibson and Luke Garbutt down the left allowed the 21-year-old to cross and the volley applied by Lukaku from 12 yards was exquisite. By the time news of Liverpool's demise filtered though, Young Boys had all but rolled over. Mirallas could have scored when clear down the right only for the goalkeeper to save his shot down to his right. Soon after, though, he did score, running on to a Gibson through ball to beat the goalkeeper underneath his body. Mirallas was denied again by the keeper early in the second period while, with 15 minutes left, Lukaku's replacement Arouna Kone struck the post from the edge of the penalty area. Late on Everton had a goal disallowed as Leon Osman was penalised for a push. By that time Everton were perhaps more occupied by who they would be playing in the next round. Remarkably, they are the only British club left. Everton's Naismith (far left) and Young Boys midfielder Sanogo (centre right) had to separated after they clashed at Goodison Park .

"It's only February but already Burnley would appear to be suffering from an acute case of relegation anxiety. For the second home game running in the Barclays Premier League, Sean Dyche's team failed to hold on to a two-goal advantage. Unlike their previous home game – that they lost 3-2 to Crystal Palace – Burnley managed to hold on for a point here, a late goal line clearance from Ben Mee ensuring that disappointment didn't once again become calamity. But Burnley have now taken one point when they really should have had six and, with a fixture list featuring both Manchester clubs, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham between now and mid-April, this may yet be the kind of afternoon that ultimately sends them down. Ashley Barnes opens the scoring for Burnley early in the first half at Turf Moor in their clash with West Bromwich Albion .

If that sounds rather negative — Burnley are not actually in the bottom three at the moment — then that’s probably because Dyche’s team do not currently seem to have the wherewithal to survive. They are not short on talent and they are capable of playing attractive, incisive football. Canny they are not, however. They are about as streetwise as a tourist walking down Oxford Street with their handbag hanging open and it is this that threatens them as the season begins to drift towards its defining weeks. For half an hour here yesterday Burnley were terrific. Playing on an uneven surface, Dyche’s players passed the ball neatly and purposefully. They were two goals up before West Brom had really got going and the game looked as though it was almost over after goals from Ashley Barnes and the excellent Danny Ings. However, a header from Chris Brunt just before half-time seemed to signal an almost total change of mood and emphasis. Sure enough, Burnley didn’t have the durability to take the blow on the chin and keep moving forward. As such, it surprised nobody when West Brom substitute Brown Ideye, the club’s £10million record signing, headed in the equaliser in the 67th minute. Ideye was close to a cut-price move to Qatar club Al Gharafa on transfer deadline day. Afterwards Dyche did his utmost to spin the result positively but the Burnley manager put his finger on the problem when he said: ‘The margins are fine in this division. You have to be tuned in every inch of the way. You can’t switch off. You have to see every game through and play hard. ‘But I thought we were excellent on the whole. Particularly in the first half I thought we were great.’ West Brom's record signing celebrates his goal on Sunday afternoon, it was his third for the club in all competitions . Nigerian forward Ideye posted this message on his Twitter account following the draw at Turf Moor . With the score tied at 2-2, Baggies centre back Joleon Lescott clears the ball off the line . Saido Berahino started on the bench against Burnley but was brought on by Tony Pulis after Victor Anichebe got injured .

The 31-year-old Fletcher, who was making his debut for West Brom, replaced Brunt as captain of the side . Ben Mee of Burnley tackles West Brom's January signing Callum McManaman during the first half at Turf Moor . Certainly Burnley didn’t look like a team with relegation issues in the first half. Ings could have put them ahead within a couple of minutes, striking a first time shot just over the bar from 15 yards, before Scott Arfield came even closer soon after. Moving on to a low cross from the right, Arfield’s side-foot shot was perfectly struck and seemed destined for the top corner before Ben Foster reached out a hand and touched the ball onto the crossbar. It was a terrific save from the goalkeeper and for a few minutes at least it ensured that parity remained. In only the 11th minute, though, Burnley scored the goal that already seemed inevitable as Ings won a tussle at the far post and hooked the ball back across the face of goal for Barnes to head in from a matter of yards. At this stage, West Brom really were not in the game. Burnley were proving far too purposeful and they broke to score a second goal just after half an hour. It was a neat and intelligent dummy by Kieran Trippier in the middle of the field that allowed the always dangerous George Boyd to find some space down the right. The former Hull City player still had much to do from tight on the touchline but his cross was well struck and that allowed Ings to meet it 12 yards out and head powerfully down and into the corner to Foster’s left. West Brom manager Tony Pulis commented later that his team had started the game as though they were still in bed. He had a point. Despite the appointment of Darren Fletcher as captain, the visiting team were aimless and rudderless. Brunt’s header from a corner just before the break changed everything, though, and when Ideye did likewise midway through the second half it was anybody’s game. Burnley did come again late on. They probably should have had a penalty when Gareth McAuley handled a cross from Mee but the Burnley full back’s most significant contribution was still to come as he diverted Saido Berahino’s late shot away from goal after a mistake from Jason Shackell. ‘This is gonna be a tough one,’ said Pulis, referring to West Brom’s own relegation issue. ‘There isn’t that much time to do the things that need doing. But this is a good point for us. We were much better in the second half.’ West Brom midfielder Claudio Yacob tracks Burnley goal scorer and star striker Ings during the first half .

"President Barack Obama and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will renew there 'special relationship' next week when the pair meet to give the Jersey Shore a boost with a post-Memorial Day visit to showcase recovery efforts in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. The White House says the president will tour the coastline with Gov. Christie on Tuesday and speak about the need to expand economic opportunities for middle-class families hit by the storm. He also plans to meet with business and home owners who have benefited from the recovery. Obama and Christie were a picture of bipartisanship after Sandy hit in October. Gov. Christie's favorable words and photo opportunities helped give the Obama a useful boost just before last year's presidential election and lost Christie some friends amongst his fellow Republicans. Together again: Obama and Christie were a picture of bipartisanship after Sandy hit in October and will meet again on Tuesday . He kept up his praise of the president last month when he said Obama 'has kept every promise he's made' about helping the state recover from Superstorm Sandy. The . federal government has spent $1.3 billion to assist families directly . victimized by the storm. The government has set aside more than $1 . billion to help rebuilding efforts in states and $5.4 billion to help . longer-term recovery efforts in the affected states. Christie also said he . had no regrets about deciding to reach out to the President for help. 'I think he's done a good job. He . kept his word,' Christie said on April 29 which marked the six-month . anniversary of Hurricane Sandy. Speaking on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' program on the six-month anniversary of the deadly storm, the Republican governor said presidential politics had been the last thing on his mind when he toured storm-devastated areas with Obama last fall. Comforter-in-chief: Christie said Obama's support for the region did not end with the October 31 photo op, but he 'kept every promise' that was made about recovery funding . People walk along the newly rebuilt boardwalk in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, many of the area's famed beaches and boardwalks are ready for summer . Christie's warm embrace of Obama after the storm angered some Republicans, who said it helped tip the presidential election to the Democrat and away from Mitt Romney, who Christie endorsed and for whom he campaigned last fall. Christie says he and Obama have fundamentally different views on governing, but he argues that the two men did what needed to be done for a devastated region. 'I've got a job to do,' he said. 'You wake up and 7 million of your 8.8 million citizens are out of power, you're not thinking about presidential politics.' Christie challenged his critics to put themselves in his shoes while dealing with the massive storm, predicting none of them would have done anything differently. 'I have a 95 per cent level of disagreement with Barack Obama,' Christie said. But that did not come into play while dealing with the storm. 'We saw suffering together,' Christie said. Gov. Christie has already shown Britain's Prince Harry along the new boardwalk in Seaside Heights during a tour of areas of Ocean County that suffered extensive damage during Sandy . Surveying what survived: Christie came under fire from Republicans who criticized the Governor for speaking so highly about the President just days before the election, but Christie brushed off the criticism . 'Everything the president promised me they'd do, they've done. I don't have any complaint this morning on the issue of disaster relief.' Sandy destroyed about 360,000 homes or apartment units in New Jersey, and some areas along the shore are still devastated. Congress approved more than $60billion in Sandy relief funds, most of it for New Jersey and New York, despite opposition from many Congressional Republicans who wanted to spend less. 'We've made a lot of progress in six . months; I know we still have a long way to go,'  Christie said at a . recent town hall meeting. 'By . Memorial Day, every boardwalk that was destroyed at the Jersey shore . will be rebuilt. Businesses are reopening. Rentals are picking up again, . roads are back open.' Christie estimated 39,000 New Jersey families remain displaced, down from 161,000 the day after the storm. What needs to be done: There are still people in New York and New Jersey who are living in hotel rooms because their homes remain damaged .","Obama and Christie were a picture of bipartisanship after Sandy hit in October .
On Tuesday the pair will meet again to check on the recovery effort in the storms aftermath ."

"Bridget Anne Kelly wasn't known as an aggressive political animal who would take delight in snarling up the traffic for schoolchildren and emergency services to score petty political points. She is a mother-of-four after all. One who rose quickly up the political ladder in New Jersey with the words 'pleasant' and 'integrity' attached to her by those who worked and shared the school run with her. But her reputation is today in tatters after Chris Christie fired his $140,000-a-year loyal deputy chief of staff  for 'lying' and 'betraying' him over the 'Bridgegate' plan to close two lanes of traffic on the George Washington Bridge. And for her friends, those who know her the best, this just doesn't fit, she was 'no political pit bull'. They are convinced she's the scapegoat, the fall guy, or at the very least has been set up. Scroll down for video . Loyal: Friends of Bridget Kelly, pictured here with her four children, believe she is being used as a scapegoat . Governor Chris Christie is pictured, second from left, at Bridget Kelly's birthday celebration . 'The young lady did not just wake up one morning, when you see the emails, she didn’t just wake up one morning and decide let’s screw up the traffic in Fort Lee,' former colleague and ex-congressman Bill Pascrell Jr told North Jersey.com. And a childhood friend of Ms Kelly, who asked to remain anonymous, insisted to MailOnline the 41-year-old had been burned after going into politics to help others. 'The noose has been out around her neck to take the fall for this. It's appalling ... They're saying, ""We've got them ... See we're punishing somebody and that's the end of it"",' the source said. They added: 'I think as the dust settles the truth will come out. Somebody has moved quick to stamp the fire out and hold somebody ultimately responsible. 'With time the true story will come out . I believe this story is much more multifaceted than just Bridget Kelly. My friend has been scapegoated. She does not have a vindictive bone in her body.' Friends in the Ramsey, New Jersey . community, where Ms Kelly lives with her two daughters and two sons, aged 17, 14, 10 and seven, came . out in support of their neighbor, who is said to have come from a good family of 'high morals and values'. She sends her children to Catholic schools. In 2005, she wrote a letter to the editor of a local paper about her son, Conor, then 5, who had a heart defect. According to NorthJersey.com, she wrote: 'I want parents to have hope for children with heart disease... it is not automatically a death sentence, and although it is extremely difficult to maintain a positive attitude during such tribulation, it is imperative for the children that parents remain hopeful and optimistic that we have access to the best medical care in the country.' Friends said Kelly, pictured here with Christie in September last year, was 'excited but not starry-eyed' about working for the governor .

One . friend, who asked to remain anonymous, told NJ Patch: 'Bridget is . wonderful. She's a great mother, a wonderful friend. She's being . scapegoated.' And on a Facebook forum supporters closed ranks around Kelly, with one woman, Patty Swanton Synder, saying: 'Bridget is a woman of honor, decorum and integrity. I am appalled that she is being made a scapegoat of all this.' Fired: Bridget Kelly has lost her job as Chris Christie's deputy chief of staff . Outside of her political career, Ms Kelly was involved in her community, where she served on the parent boards of her children's schools. Her now deleted Twitter account further revealed a dedicated mother who took pleasure in her children's accomplishments and enjoyed family events such as Thanksgiving fun runs. Although recently separated from her husband, professional golfer Patrick, the couple still lived close together. Her father Richard Daul, a director of Veteran Services in the county, refused to comment on his daughter's situation, but those close to the family said they had strong values. And what has shocked friends is the claim that she would endanger public safety by snarling up the traffic on the GWB and delaying emergency vehicles - particularly as her brother is an EMT. Ms Kelly had risen quickly through the ranks since graduating from Mount St Mary's University with a political science degree in 1994. Despite her quick climb, co-workers denied she was 'the political pit bull type', further casting doubt on her having a leading role in the bridge scandal. 'I don’t know who the person is that gave the ultimate order,' Mr Pascrell said, adding that he did not believe Ms Kelly would suddenly have decided to set off the chain of events herself. However, a Republican official in Bergen County who did not want to be named, told Philly.com: 'If someone talked to her funny or didn't give her the right amount of respect, she'd make a phone call and put the kibosh on it', referring to how she would block volunteers jostling for political jobs moving up. Former co-workers described Kelly as ambitious but not the 'political pit bull' type . Kelly, who quickly rose through the ranks to become deputy chief of staff, is pictured in September last year . Kelly, pictured with her brother Eamon Daul, and a family friend . Outside of work Kelly was focused on her family and served on school boards . He added: 'It's the banter she would . usually have used. It's something that she would have said. I'm just . surprised she'd be stupid enough to write it down.' Ms . Kelly had joined Christie's staff in 2010, but her career started as a . legislative aide - and later chief of staff - for assemblyman David . Russo. Over the next few years she moved up the . ranks, and was promoted to her well-paid role as deputy chief of staff in . April last year. But a close friend said despite being thrilled by the high-flying role she remained down-to-earth. 'Who wouldn't be excited about working for the governor. Who wouldn't . be. But for her it was an opportunity to give back. She wasn't starry . eyed about working for the governor. She was excited about having a . position that she could be a voice of the people.' The . source said that the bridge scandal was the ugly side of politics' and . added: 'It does not become her whatsoever and it's not who she is.' The promotion moved Ms Kelly into Christie's inner circle, putting her in close contact with officials and lawmakers, including Fort Lee mayor Mark Sokolich, who was the subject of several of the emails. Kelly's father, Richard Daul, has refused to comment about the scandal . The Kelly family home in Ramsey, New Jersey, where fellow residents have described Bridget as a woman of integrity . Friends and supporters of Kelly describe her as a 'woman of honor' Her role brought her so close to Christie that she even tweeted a picture of him at her 40th birthday dinner last year. In . a message tweeted to @GovChristie and several others in September 2012 . she said: 'Thank you for a great night ... and it's rare that I'm at a . loss for words'. As . questions swirl in Trenton about the two Christie aides who got the axe . on Wednesday, MailOnline learned that they were connected by more than . just the jobs they lost. Ms . Kelly, Christie's now-former deputy chief of staff, was apprenticed to . political insider Bill Stepien when they both worked on his 2012 . re-election campaign, and she took orders directly from him, according . to a long-time New Jersey political operative who spoke to MailOnline in . Washington DC. The . insider, who requested anonymity, told MailOnline that Ms Kelly was the . tie between Christie's administration and the state's Republican . political machine. Mr Stepien's job, the source said, 'was to keep the governor's fingerprints off of things,' and Ms Kelly's 'was to put plans into action'. The 'plans' that came to light this week were part of a dirty-tricks campaign meant to use a traffic jam to settle an unspecified political score. He wouldn’t speculate on how much Governor Christie knew about the bridge-traffic plan while it was in motion. But speaking of Ms Kelly, he claimed that 'if she pulled the trigger on all of this, it was on Bill's urging. He really trusted her.' Mr Stepien did not respond to attempts to contact him about his level of knowledge of the plan, which came to light on Wednesday when Democratic legislators released 22 pages of electronic messages showing Ms Kelly and others orchestrating the operation.","Mother-of-four rose quickly through ranks to become deputy chief of staff .

"MPs are demanding full ‘home rule’ for England once new powers over tax and benefits are handed to Scotland in the biggest constitutional shake-up for decades. The Tories and Lib Dems appear determined to force a Commons vote on the issue within months, leaving Labour out in the cold by opposing the move. David Cameron vowed to publish proposals on English votes for English laws before Christmas, saying yesterday the case was now ‘unanswerable’. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, pictured, said he was about to publish proposals for English votes on English laws . However, the move prompted a fierce row over whether to ban Scots from voting on income tax rates. A report by the cross-party Smith Commission, published yesterday, set out a new deal for Scotland following its rejection of independence that will see Holyrood control income tax, VAT revenues, air passenger duty and the power to introduce new benefits. The package will transform Holyrood into one of the world’s most powerful devolved parliaments. Lord Smith of Kelvin chaired the Commission set up in the wake of the independence referendum in September . But within hours, the resurgent Scottish Nationalists suggested it was not good enough and Scotland’s new First Minister Nicola Sturgeon complained of ‘continued Westminster rule’. The settlement also prompted turmoil at Westminster, with Labour split over the implications of English home rule, under which Scots MPs would be prevented from voting on measures that only apply to the rest of the UK. The party could be permanently hobbled if its 40 Scottish MPs are stripped of the right to vote on issues controlled by the Scottish Parliament such as tax, welfare, health and education. And there are doubts over whether an MP in a Scottish seat could ever again be Prime Minister or Chancellor, as they would have only a limited say over proposed legislation. Mr Cameron said he was ‘delighted’ with the Smith Commission report, adding: ‘I think the report today also makes the case for English votes for English laws unanswerable and we will be taking action on that shortly.’ Although the commission included a promise that MPs from across Britain can still vote on a national budget, it became clear yesterday that the Conservatives intend a ban to apply to financial matters that only apply to the rest of the UK. Scots MPs could therefore be excluded from votes on income tax rates – which could make it impossible for Labour to introduce its proposed new 50p top rate of tax even if it wins the general election. Mr Cameron’s spokesman said: ‘There is going to continue to be a UK budget. ‘Of course there are elements where you have seen devolution on financial matters, and in that respect I would say the principle of English votes for English laws applies. In terms of what is for the UK, that will remain UK-wide.’ The new powers will be fought over by Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Jim Murphy, who is a frontrunner in the race to lead Labour in Scotland . Sir George Young said proposals accentuated a 'constitutional imbalance' between England and the UK . Mr Clegg suggested the Lib Dems also want to curb Scots MPs’ say over income tax votes. ‘We need to look at this issue of how you deal with matters which come up from time to time which only affect England and Wales,’ he said. Labour accused the other parties of betraying the promise made in the Smith Commission. Mr Miliband said: ‘I think it’s part of the integrity of the UK that it continues to be the place that Scottish MPs vote on the budget.’ Former Commons leader Sir George Young said the Smith Commission proposals ‘further accentuate the imbalance in the British constitution between England and the rest of the United Kingdom’.And Treasury committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said the English ‘must have a veto on all laws that largely or exclusively affect them’. Former Tory cabinet minister John Redwood added: ‘Once Scotland is determining her own income tax rates and bands in the Scottish Parliament, it would be quite wrong for Scottish members of this Parliament to be trying to fix those bands and rates for the English.’ Labour MP Graeme Allen called for speedy solution to prevent a surge in English nationalism. The debate raged as Alex Salmond yesterday picked up an award – and pretended to wipe away tears of pride with a hanky designed like a St George’s flag. The former Scottish first minister mopped up mock tears in London as he was named Spectator magazine’s Politician of the Year. What new powers mean for Scotland and the rest of us . In the dying days of the referendum campaign, the three main Westminster parties promised Scotland new powers in a bid to prevent a Yes vote. Yesterday, the Smith Commission published its blueprint for implementing the dramatic changes. Here, Home Affairs Editor JAMES SLACK examines what it means. The Barnett formula . Lord Barnett, pictured, developed a system where Scotland receives more than £1,600 per head in public spending than England . The system under which Scotland gets £1,623 more public expenditure per head than England – or 19 per cent more – survives. If revisions are made, Scotland must not lose out. The funding helps to pay for items such as free prescriptions, not offered in England. Income tax and VAT . Holyrood can spend 100 per cent of income tax collected in Scotland, along with the first 10 per cent of VAT. This would give it around £15billion a year for devolved matters. Scotland would be expected to try to balance its books, but it does not have to live within its means overall. Over £65billion was spent north of the border in 2012-13. Only £53billion was raised through taxes. Tax rates and bands . Holyrood cannot alter the threshold at which tax is paid – currently £10,000 – but it could raise or lower both the basic and higher rates or introduce a new tax band. In reality, the SNP is likely to reinstate the 50p tax rate for the better-off, to fund an increase in welfare spending or job creation. It could lead to high-earning Scots domiciling themselves in England. There is also the bureaucratic nightmare of how to treat people who live in Scotland but work in England, or vice versa. Borrowing Powers . Should income tax receipts drop in a recession, Scotland could borrow billions to make up the shortfall – with the permission of the Treasury. Holyrood could also borrow to fund capital investment. Ultimately, Westminster would have to step in if things went wrong. The UK Government would be left to bail out The scots . Arguably, the crucial paragraph in the Smith report. Scots get all the benefits of increased independence but very few of the risks. In another financial crash it would again be left to the UK to bail out Scottish banks. Many taxes reserved to Westminster . Including National Insurance, inheritance and capital gains tax, corporation tax, fuel and excise duty. The SNP says 70 per cent of Scottish taxes will still be set at Westminster. In other words, it is not satisfied. The idea that devolving power would end the clamour for independence and preserve the Union has already been proved a nonsense. MPs From across the UK will decide the UK Budget . With Scots fixing their own income tax levels, there will be demands for Scottish MPs sitting at Westminster not to vote on tax policy in the rest of the UK. This could leave a Labour government that needed Scottish MPs to form a majority unable to pass its own Budget – an untenable position. English votes for English laws . The issue is ignored. But there is no way Tory MPs will not demand constitutional changes to stop Scots voting on devolved matters. The State pension . The UK – not the Scottish taxpayer – remains on the hook for the most expensive welfare spending. This includes basic and additional state pensions, and most of the benefits included in the new Universal Credit. Devolved benefits . Housing benefit, Disability Living Allowance, cold weather payments and winter fuel payments are all devolved, giving Holyrood the power to axe the so-called bedroom tax. The benefit cap could be set at a higher rate for Scots than in the rest of the UK. The Smith Commission is setting out dramatic new powers for Scotland, ordered in the wake of the referendum on independence which saw Scotland vote to stay in the UK . 16 and 17-year-olds could get the vote . For Westminster elections, the age will remain 18. But Labour and the Lib Dems are committed to giving 16-year-olds the vote for UK general elections – so the genie may already be out of the bottle. Air duty devolved. Rail could be nationalised . Holyrood could axe tax on air passengers – so Scottish airports could undercut English rivals. Public sector will be able to bid for rail contracts. Scots help to agree UK’s stance in EU discussion of devolved matters . If the Tories win the election, this may be a headache for Mr Cameron in referendum negotiations with Brussels. He will have to haggle not only with other member states, but also with a pro-EU SNP Government. Consultation to take place on devolving abortion law . Abortion is legal in the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. A rule change in Scotland could see women crossing the border – in either direction – for the procedure. Some now travel here from Northern Ireland, where it is mostly illegal. Licensing of onshore gas and oil devolved . Could mean fracking goes on across rest of the UK while Scotland is largely untouched. Offshore gas and oil receipts still go to Westminster.","English MPs now want their own 'home rule' following Scottish decision .
David Cameron will publish English votes for English law proposals .
Labour is opposed to the English votes for English law plan .
The Conservatives and Lib Dems want a vote on the plan in the New Year ."
"These incredible pictures show the moment a plucky seal managed to twist away from the killer jaws of a great white shark after being thrown into the air. The great white burst from the water only for the seal to bounce off the tip of its nose and be thrown in the air. On the way down the shark snapped with its razor-sharp jaws, missing the airborne seal by the finest of margins. The great white shark burst from the water and snapped at the airborne seal with its killer jaws - missing by a matter of inches . The heart-stopping moment was captured by Sergio Riccardo near Seal Island in South Africa - a prime feeding location for sharks . The predators are attracted to the area when the population of Cape Fur seals is at its highest creating what is known as the 'Ring of Death' The heart-stopping scene was captured by underwater photographer Sergio Riccardo near Cape Town, in South Africa. Due to the dense population of seals on Seal Island - just a few kilometres from Cape Town - the location is a prime feeding location for great whites. Mr Riccardo, 51, from Sorrento, Italy, said: 'The boat began to follow the seals back to Seal Island where there are around 70,000 seals. 'During this process the seals are often the subject of attacks by great white sharks. 'They launch themselves from underneath the seal, knocking it above the surface and snapping the mammal in their mouths. 'The speed with which the sharks attack brings them to jump completely out of the water. I was glad to see the seal escape on this occasion.' Seal Island is a granite rock around 800m long by 50m wide which sits no more than 6m above sea level about three and a half miles off False Bay, near Cape Town. It is home to huge numbers of seals - around 65,000 - which give the rock its name, and is also a popular breeding site for seabirds. The area where the sharks circle the island is known by locals as the 'Ring Of Death'.","Great white shark burst from the water and narrowly avoided the airborne seal with its razor-sharp jaws .

"Commuting is – quite literally – a pain in the neck. A fifth of the British workforce say their journey to and from work is leaving them with neck, back and muscle pain, a new survey has today revealed. Those who commute by car are most affected, with 63 per cent of drivers reporting their commute leaves them uncomfortable. This is compared to 11 per cent on the bus. And for Londoners struggling on the tube and buses each day, almost 60 per cent claim their suffering would be lessened with just a little more space. A fifth of the British workforce says their journey to and from work is leaving them with neck, back and muscle pain. Commuters in London have it worst. Three quarters (73 per cent) feel that their commute contributes to aches and pains and more than half (59 per cent) claim more room would mean they suffer less . Cyclists and runners are among those least likely to feel any back or joint pain, with only six per cent and five per cent respectively saying they do. Taking the train was found to be a good option, with only five per cent of riders reporting pain. A poll, published today, found commuters in London have it worst. Three quarters (73 per cent) feel their commute contributes to aches and pains and more than half (59 per cent) claim more room would mean they suffer less. Meanwhile, 16 per cent of people say their commute has got more crowded over the last two years, with one in eight (12 per cent) saying they believe if they had more space they'd suffer less joint pain. However, of those who suffer from back and joint pain, almost half (48 per cent) don't consider their posture when commuting and only a fifth (21 per cent) make a conscious effort to stretch their back or legs whilst on their journey. And it's not just the commute that's a problem – the poll found the average worker sits or stands in the same position for three and a half hours a day. Driving hurts the most, with 63 per cent reporting their commute leaves them uncomfortable . Katherine Cran, a physiotherapist in London says commuting and then sitting in an office all day can damage the body over time. She said: 'Commuting to and from work every day can have a profound effect on the body. 'Over time and without the right care, this can lead to long term joint and muscle damage. 'I often see people with back and joint pain who sit all day at work and tend to sit or stand throughout their commute too. 'Incorporating physical exercise into your day, checking your posture and doing a few simple exercises can help make a real difference.' In 2013, 31 million working days were lost due to back, neck and muscle pains according to figures from the Office for National Statistics – in fact, more days were lost to musculoskeletal problems than any other cause. The poll was carried out by Bupa. Katherine Cran, a physiotherapist at Bupa's Basinghall clinic offers advice for managing joint and muscle pain while commuting: . Movement is medicine: try to increase the amount of physical activity you do whether its during your commute, or by incorporating it into your day – this could include cycling to work once week or walking around the block at lunchtimes; . Drive comfortably: drivers need to make sure they sit in a comfortable position that's right for them - adjust your seat, back support and steering wheel to avoid leaning too far back or having to stretch to reach the wheel or pedals. You should also avoid placing pressure behind your knees; . Avoid prolonged sitting: whether it's on your commute or in the workplace, try a mixture of standing and sitting: . Hop off earlier: one of the easiest ways to make a significant difference when commuting is to get off one or two stops earlier to increase your physical activity; . Simple exercises: help keep your joints mobile and prevent stiffness by doing some simple exercises and stretches such as gently rotating your ankles, lifting your knees, extending your legs and rolling your shoulders.","A fifth of British workforce say their commute leaves them with pain .

"Marouane Fellaini's long-awaited emergence as a contributing member of the Manchester United squad was confirmed by the Belgian's goal in the FA Cup at Preston on Monday night. Fellaini's increasing importance to United, however, perhaps says as much about the learning curve being experienced by his manager Louis van Gaal in English football than it does about his own improvement. Van Gaal arrived at United last summer intent on playing a certain style of football. Almost immediately he instructed United chief executive Ed Woodward to try to sell Fellaini, saying privately that he was 'not a Manchester United player'. Marouane Fellaini celebrates scoring their second goal for United against Preston . The Belgian midfielder scored from close range after his initial header was saved . Fellaini came off the bench to rescue United as they booked their place in the quarter final . Had a foot injury not got in the way of a subsequent loan move to Napoli last August, Fellaini would no longer be at Old Trafford. Van Gaal, however, has realised in recent weeks just how useful the Belgian can be when he needs to change his team's style of play. At West Ham in the Barclays Premier League recently, Fellaini's introduction as a substitute earned United a goal and a point. On Monday in Lancashire, Fellaini's switch to the focal point of a hastily restructured 4-4-2 formation earned him what was effectively the winning goal. 'I have used Fellaini a lot of times already - more than ever and he scores more than ever,' Van Gaal said. 'He (Fellaini) is a player that when we cannot beat the pressure with quality, we can always beat the pressure [another way]. 'Now I have played him for the first time in his [preferred] position.' Those who remember Fellaini at his best – for Everton and for Belgium – will recall him using his height and physical presence high up the field. He was, during his time under David Moyes at Goodison Park, a talented and effective attacking outlet. Fellaini looked to be on his way out of Old Trafford in the summer when Louis van Gaal came in . A foot injury in the summer prevented Fellaini from moving to Napoli on loan . Moyes once described Fellaini as having the best chest trap in world football. It was a peculiar statement and sounded almost as though the 27–year-old was being damned with faint praise. More interestingly, it was a talent that Moyes seemed to negate after he brought Fellaini to United by trying to turn him in to a holding midfield player. It was a plan that didn't work and it is from positions in the final third of the field that Fellaini is now beginning to exert an influence once again. 'The manager is the boss but of course I like that,' said Fellaini yesterday when asked about a role up front. 'I can score goals from there so I am happy. Radamel Falcao started the game against Preston - but was taken off in the second half . 'We changed the game when the manager switched things and I went forward. It worked well.' Van Gaal certainly didn't envisage finding a place for Fellaini in the forward line when he replaced Moyes last year. The Dutch coach understandably felt that Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Angel di Maria, James Wilson and Radamel Falcao would provide him with enough options in those positions. Van Gaal didn't think there was room in his midfield for Fellaini either but, as time has passed, the United manager has realised that English football – and particularly the Barclays Premier League – asks so many different questions and requires so many different answers that players like Fellaini can become useful. Van Gaal will talk all day about his love of attractive football but he is, above all, a pragmatist and always has been. David Moyes signed Fellaini from Everton and described the player as having the best chest trap in football . This is the man who shunted the great Brazilian striker Rivaldo out to the wing during his years at Barcelona, the man who used Dirk Kuyt is five different positions in one game – including right-back and centre forward – during a World Cup knockout game last summer. Currently the United manager has players like Falcao and Van Persie who are – by their own standards – failing to do their jobs. Falcao was wretched against Preston and, with Van Persie expected to be fit for the game at Swansea this weekend, one wonders when we will see the Colombian in the starting line-up again. It is, therefore, at times like this that players like Fellaini start to become rather useful indeed. For reasons that are not entirely his fault, United's big Belgian will forever be associated with Moyes' troubled tenure at Old Trafford. He will be known as the big money signing who bombed. Footballers are allowed more than one life at a club, though, more than one chance. Fellaini will never be an iconic Manchester United footballer but his contributions are becoming frequent enough to have already proved a few people wrong, including his own manager.","Louis van Gaal was keen to sell Marouane Fellaini in the summer .

"Held: Carl Singleton, 41, from Cumbria, was arrested on suspicion of murdering 22-year-old  Ashley Agumbi, a University of Nairobi student . A British man is behind bars in Kenya accused of murdering the girlfriend he met on Facebook by flushing her diabetic medicine down the toilet. Carl Singleton, 41, from Millom, Cumbria, was on Sunday arrested on suspicion of murdering 22-year-old Peris Ashley Agumbi Mumtah, a student at the University of Nairobi. Miss Agumbi died in hospital of diabetic hypertension and respiratory failure days after making a report to police accusing Singleton of flushing her life-saving medicine down the toilet. Singleton appeared in court on Monday. He was remanded in custody for seven days after police asked for time to file a murder charge. He made no plea. Singleton's mother Elaine Singleton, 63, who lives in Millom, last night said she felt she was living her 'worst nightmare' when her son called her from Gigiri police station in Nairobi on Monday. 'I was absolutely devastated. It's my worst nightmare come true,' she said of the news of his arrest. 'He was really upset, he really was, I could tell by his voice. He just said he was in the police station locked up and that they thought he had killed his girlfriend. He just kept saying he didn't do it. 'It's really difficult because he's so far away. I can't get it out my head. I feel terrible. It's awful, it really is.' Singleton met Miss Agumbi online through Facebook two years ago. Six months ago he flew out to Kenya on a tourist visa to spend time with her in person. 'He fell in love and went out there,' his mother said. Dominic Wabala, crime reporter on Kenyan daily The Star, told MailOnline that Singleton was living with Miss Agumbi and her family in Gachie, a town on the outskirts of Nairobi. Miss Agumbi had reported Singleton to police for allegedly assaulting her on November 19, telling officers he had flushed her diabetes drugs down the toilet. Days later, on November 21, she fell ill and was taken to Nairobi's private Aga Khan University Hospital, but was later transferred to Ladnan hospital where she was diagnosed with diabetic hypertension and respiratory failure. She died while undergoing treatment, Mr Wabala reported. 'He was really upset, he really was, I could tell by his voice': Singleton's mother Elaine, 63,said she felt she was living her 'worst nightmare' when her son called her from Gigiri police station in Nairobi on Monday . Tragic: Miss Agumbi, shown in a Facebook picture, died in hospital of diabetic hypertension and respiratory failure days after making a report to police accusing Singleton of flushing her medicine down the toilet . Miss Agumbi's death and Singleton's arrest came days after he messaged his younger brother Steven, 21, over Facebook to say he had extended his trip by a further six months and would be home in February. 'I thought he must be smitten to be flying out there to meet her. I'm just completely shocked by it all. I'm trying not to think about it,' Steven said. Mrs Singleton described her son, a former Bargain Booze employee, as 'kind-hearted and shy'. 'He's a quiet man. I think the size of him frightens people because he's very tall,' she said. 'To look at him you'd think he was really robust but deep down he's quiet, soft and shy. 'He's quiet and has always kept himself to himself.' Singleton's father Norman, 66, was walking the family dog, Josie, when his wife called him to say what happened. Mr Singleton said: 'She rang me and she was in a mess. I was absolutely speechless.' The family said Singleton was 'bubbly' and happy during a Skype conversation in October. Mr Singleton said: 'He said he was having a great time and we even got Josie up on camera for him to see.' The family said the embassy had been keeping them abreast of the situation but they have not been able to speak to him since Monday. The Foreign Office said: 'We can confirm the arrest of a British national in Kenya on November 23. We are providing consular assistance.'","Carl Singleton flew to Kenya to be with Ashley Agumbi six months ago .

"A secretary who hurled racist abuse at fellow passengers on a Tube train while drunk had brought shame to Britain, a judge said yesterday. Jacqueline Woodhouse, 42, was jailed for 21 weeks for her foul-mouthed tirade.

Today at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in central London, district judge Michael Snow sentenced her to 21 . weeks behind bars - but she will be eligible for release in just over . 10 weeks. Previously the court was told that . Woodhouse had drunk an 'unknown' quantity of champagne at a retirement . party before getting on the Tube at 11pm. Foul-mouthed: Woodhouse was caught on camera making racist remarks as she travelled on the Underground . Woodhouse, of Romford in Essex, admitted causing harassment alarm and distress to Mr Juttla earlier this month. In the video which was played in court . earlier this month, the clip begins with Woodhouse shouting in a thick . Essex accent about 'foreign s*** heads'. She turns to her passengers and asks: 'Where do you come from? Where do you come from? Where do you come from? 'I would like to know if any of you are illegal? I am sure like 30 per cent of you are.' She then turns on the Pakistani man . sitting next to her, who is singing his national anthem, and threatens . to 'punch him in the face.' 'I wouldn’t mind if you loved our country,' she adds. She then turns to Mr Juttla's camera, as he assures her he would rather be listening to his music than to her. Woodhouse ignores the anger of other passengers as she continues her aggressive seven-minute tirade . 'Oh look he’s filming, hello,' she says. 'Hello government.' She goes on: 'Why don’t you tell me where you’re from?' He replies: 'I am British.' She gets her phone out of her black handbag and looks as if she is filming him too. Mr Juttla warns her: 'Watch what you are saying.' She replies: 'I used to live in England and now I live in the United Nations.' As he tells her to keep her mouth . shut, informing her that she has had too much to drink, she becomes . extremely agitated and starts screaming. 'It’s not your country anyway so what’s your problem?' she yells. 'It’s been overtaken by people like you.' The court heard that Mr Juttla decided to film Woodhouse after she started berating an unidentified black female. She then sat down between two men and began another barrage of abuse. Speaking after Woodhouse was jailed, . Mr Juttla from Ilford, Essex said: 'This sends a message to her and . other people like her not to carry on. 'I don't accept that I am not British and I am certainly not unemployed. 'I think the judge made the right decision, although maybe he could have given her a bit longer.' Appalling behaviour: The court was told that Woodhouse had drunk an 'unknown' quantity of champagne at a retirement party before getting on the Tube at 11pm . Mr Juttla, a single father-of-two added: 'I was pretty shocked, and I don't want to go through anything like this again. 'I was born in this country, and I don't accept any of this behaviour.' Rebecca Lee, defending Woodhouse, said . she was 'deeply ashamed' of her behaviour but claimed she was often . anxious on the tube due to terrorist events of 2005. Ms Lee asked that a community order be . considered and stressed her client would be willing to attend a . diversity awareness and prejudice training course. She added: 'She is horrified to see it . (the clip) and offers her very sincere apologies in particular to the . individuals involved but also to all of those on the train that day and . the others who are many who have seen this clip online. 'She is dismayed not only for those . who were present but also because she has friends and family members who . are black and Asian.' Ms Lee also explained her client . recognised her actions were linked to heavy alcohol consumption, adding . she had sought help from her GP and counselling since the incident. In addition the court heard that Woodhouse had lost her job and was now claiming benefits. Ms Lee concluded: 'She is a person who has a great deal more to be said about her than what is reflected on those video clips.' But Judge Snow insisted the offence merited a custodial sentence. 'She threatened violence against more than one person. It took place over a prolonged period. 'Those who were not frightened . admirably challenged her, on occasions trying to deflate her grossly . offensive behaviour with humour. 'Her appalling behaviour went beyond . that which I have described, the language making it clear it was . motivated by hostility to her fellow passengers who were not white . British.' He refused to give Woodhouse any . credit for changing her plea to guilty the day before the trial, . claiming the witnesses had already suffered 'inevitable worry'. He also said he found it hard to accept the sincerity of her shame. Woodhouse, who was said to be in a . 'loving' relationship with her partner of 12 years, was supported in . court by one of her sisters and a niece. Spate of incidents: Police took Emma West into custody in December after a video (pictured) appeared on the internet showing a woman apparently abusing tram passengers . The publicity and attention to her . case was said to have taken a 'considerable toll' on her mental health . and she was prescribed medication for depression. She appeared to show no emotion as she was led from the dock. She attended court today wearing a black and white floral dress and dark sunglasses. As she walked along the pavement, arm-in-arm with a woman dressed in a suit, she held a large black umbrella over her face. The prosecutor also told the court . that Woodhouse had been convicted of an identical rant on a Docklands . Light Railway train in December 2008 for which she was fined. Before officers asked Mr Juttla to take the video down, it had been watched 21,000 times. Since duplicates have been made, it has been watched by hundreds of thousands of people. The video emerged after a spate of . similar clips were uploaded on to the internet. Emma West was charged . with a racially aggravated public order offence in connection with an . incident on a tram in December. Another video called 'Welcome to London' showed a woman holding a pink rose on the London Underground as she abused passengers. Another was of a drunk woman who tried . to punch a black passenger on a London bus, but ended up falling over . herself then being thrown into the street.

"A pensioner who was hit by a car and knocked unconscious was left lying in the road bleeding because an ambulance failed to turn up for 90 minutes. Margaret Freeborn, 69, was walking to a church meeting when she was hit by a car at a pelican crossing in Atherton, Greater Manchester. Police shut the road and an ambulance was called but one did not turn up to help Mrs Freeborn, who was lying on the ground and bleeding from the head, for almost two hours. Mrs Freeborn is still being treated in hospital for her injuries after the accident, which took place more than a week ago. She has been left with torn ligaments and severe bruises. Margaret Freeborn, 69, was left lying in the road waiting for an ambulance for 90 minutes after she was hit by a car while on her way to a church meeting in Atherton, Greater Manchester. She was left with severe bruising . Tania Freeborn-Hulme, Mrs Freeborn's daughter, lives near the site of the crash in Mealhouse Lane in Atherton, and ran out to help her mother. 'No one came, no rapid response, no paramedics - no one,' said Mrs Freeborn-Hulme. 'She was lying on the floor for almost two hours with only witnesses and bystanders to help. 'She was bleeding from her head and unconscious at first. The hospital couldn't believe that she'd not broken anything other than her nose. 'Her ligaments in both legs are torn and she is black and blue all over. 'It was devastating seeing her like that. We are angry that she could be left in the road all that time in pain, the police arrived fairly quickly but couldn't do anything other than stop the traffic. Mrs Freeborn, 69, is still in hospital being treated for her injuries after the accident more than a week ago . Tania Freeborn-Hulme (left) said her mother Margaret, 69, was left lying on the road bleeding after the crash . Mrs Freeborn is still badly bruised more than a week after she was knocked unconscious by the car . The accident happened at about 7.45pm but an ambulance did not turn up until 9.20pm. National targets stipulate that ambulances should respond to 75 per cent of cases deemed as the most urgent, life threatening within seven minutes. Other targets are set locally. North West Ambulance Service also has green categories, where for patients who require an ambulance but are not seen as being in a life threatening condition, paramedics should arrive within 30 minutes. A spokeswoman from the ambulance service said the call was classed as a 'green 2', based on the information given by the caller.Paramedics breached their own target by an hour, as this call requires an ambulance to attend within 30 minutes. Police cordoned off the road but paramedics still did not arrive to help the pensioner for 90 minutes . Mrs Freeborn-Hulme added: 'A witness called an ambulance immediately, yet one did not arrive until around 9.20pm. 'We were told that an ambulance had been allocated at 9.07pm but it still did not arrive until about 9.20pm.' Mrs Freeborn was going to a meeting at Bag Lane Methodist Church in Atherton, when she was hit by a Nissan Juke as she crossed the road on November 19. Her brother Glyn Williams, who also lives nearby but was not able to get through the police road blocks, said: 'There were police everywhere but she was just left there crying in the middle of the road because there was no one else there.' The 69-year-old was taken to Royal Bolton Hospital and then transferred to Salford Royal Hospital where she is still receiving treatment for her injuries. The North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust confirmed that they received the call at 7.47pm but said the crew arrived on scene at 9.07pm. A spokesman said: 'We understand that waiting for an ambulance can be distressing and we are sorry for any upset caused to the patient and their family. 'We take complaints about our service extremely seriously and would urge the patient or family to contact us as soon as possible so we can investigate the reasons behind the delay.' A police spokesman said they were treating it as an accident and they would not be taking any action against the driver.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Apprentice star and businessmen Lord Sugar today accused the French authorities in Calais of encouraging illegal immigrants to smuggle themselves into Britain . Apprentice star and businessman Lord Sugar has accused the French authorities in Calais of encouraging illegal immigrants to smuggle themselves into Britain. The Labour peer said that too often the French take the view that 'it is not our problem' and suggested they wanted to 'get rid' of the thousands of migrants camped out at the port as quickly as possible. Lord Sugar called for more British border police to be based in France, but ministers urged lorry drivers to 'padlock' their vehicles and told holidaymakers to do the same to avoid migrants sneaking on board. Growing numbers of migrants have been trying to enter the UK through Calais in recent months. Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, called for Britain send more support to Calais to deal with the port's 'tremendous problem' with illegal immigration. And the mayor of Calais Natacha Bouchart told MPs last month that Britain was seen as an 'El Dorado' for migrants – and many were prepared to die to make the journey. Blaming the UK for the crisis, Miss Bouchart said lavish benefits and the prospect of illegal work and accommodation were magnets for immigrants determined to get across the English Channel. But in the House of Lords today, peers questioned whether the French were doing enough to tackle the problem on their shores. Lord Sugar, who has had business dealings in France, questioned 'the manner in which the French police and other authorities are carrying out their job'. He asked Home Office minister Lord Bates if he thinks the French 'are really interested in the problem'. Lord Sugar added: 'My experience of dealing with the French in the commercial world, with the greatest respect, is that they think, 'It is not our problem'. 'One wonders whether they want to get rid of these people as quickly as possible. Is there a case for putting some of our people there to invigilate?' Scroll down for video . Under an agreement between London and Paris, UK Border Force staff are based in France to try to catch people before they leave instead of monitoring arrivals in the UK. Lord Bates said: 'We have Border Force people on the ground augmenting the work done by the port-side authorities' 'In addition, we have sniffer dogs on the port side, as well as the fencing which we are introducing. That co-operation is there; we should like it to be extended.' There are up to 2,500 illegal immigrants camped in the French port trying to reach UK, with many clambering into lorries to cross the Channel . Earlier this month MailOnline revealed Britain has just five scanners to detect stowaways trying to enter the country in lorries through our 29 ports. The UK Border Force budget also fell by 20 per cent last year, raising fears about the ability to detect attempts by foreigners to smuggle themselves across the Channel in cars, trucks and trailers. Ministers were forced to admit that despite there being 51 points of entry into the UK at 29 ports for foreign vehicles, there are just five scanners in operation in France checking vehicles before they leave for Britain. Lord Bates said the problem was only likely to get worse and warned both lorry and car drivers to be on their guard. Former commissioner of the Metropolitan police Lord Condon questioned what the 'major impediment' was to coming up with a solution to the problem. Lord Bates told him: 'The very simple tasks of actually securing the vehicle and ensuring that it is padlocked - if that happened the problem would be reduced dramatically from what it is.' Shadow Home Office minister Baroness Smith of Basildon said: 'Desperate migrants will get access to any vehicle in order to try and seek a better life. 'Many travellers to France in their cars for a weekend or to do their shopping are being advised in Calais not to leave their cars empty even to enter a shop or to have lunch.' She asked: 'What advice are you giving to domestic travellers to Calais and do you think we have enough border staff given the cuts that they have taken from the Government?' Lord Bates said the Border Agency had been reformed to provide 'the toughest regime in the world'. 'The reality is that in terms of domestic tourists and other travellers there they should really be aware that this is a major problem - it is only to get worse and they have to take the same level of security to protect their vehicles as well,' he said. Tory former Cabinet minister Lord Tebbit asked: 'Why do these people arrive here? Surely they have been in France? Are they fleeing from persecution in France? 'What's wrong with the French state that it doesn't accept its obligations to look after such people?' Lord Bates said a fall in unemployment and growth in the economy in the UK, which was the 'opposite' to France, was acting as a 'pull factor into this country'.","Apprentice star accused French of trying to 'get rid' of migrants in Calais .

"Two of the BBC’s top executives have claimed salary cuts cannot go much further…despite the fact they are paid a combined £690,000-a-year. Strategy chief James Purnell, who earns £295,000, and finance director Anne Bulford, on £395,000, were accused of ‘scare tactics’ as they threatened to slash the programming budget to save more money. Miss Bulford said ‘tough choices’ would have to be made over which services are cut as further belt-tightening in pay, staff numbers and the property portfolio is impossible. Strategy chief James Purnell (right), who earns £295,000, and finance director Anne Bulford, on £395,000, were accused of ‘scare tactics’ as they threatened to slash the programming budget to save more money . Meanwhile Mr Purnell – who is a former Labour cabinet minister – refused to rule out the closure of another TV channel such as arts station BBC4 to save cash. But Tory MP Philip Davies claimed yesterday there was ‘plenty more fat to be cut from the BBC’s bloated management’ and accused them of trying to frighten viewers into supporting an increase in the licence fee. He said: ‘This is a scare tactic to get public support for the BBC budget. This has Purnell’s fingerprints all over it. It used to be a standard Labour party tactic to cut essential services rather than salaries. ‘Then they complain about how hard the cuts are affecting ordinary people, while holding on to their own pay deals. I just hope the Government and the public don’t fall for it. This reminds me of the dark arts of the Tony Blair spin years.’ Miss Bulford published a report entitled Driving Efficiency At The BBC in which she said the corporation had made £1.1billion in annual savings since 2007, but needs to find an extra £400million a year by 2017. She argued that most of the savings made so far were ‘structural or one-off opportunities’, including a reduction in staff numbers, property sales, and ‘pay restraint’. She insisted that by reducing senior manager numbers and pay, the BBC had saved £20million a year, but argued that ‘the BBC’s ability to deliver efficiencies in the same scale is reducing’. As a result, Miss Bulford said ‘touch choices’ would have to be made, raising fears the BBC will cut more services rather than slim down its management further. Director general Tony Hall – who earns £450,000 a year - has already announced plans to axe youth channel BBC3, but it is thought BBC4 could be the next to go . Thirteen of the BBC’s most senior directors – who control its news, radio and TV channels – are paid a combined £3.6million. Director general Tony Hall – who earns £450,000 a year - has already announced plans to axe youth channel BBC3, but it is thought BBC4 could be the next to go. Interviewed on Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Purnell refused to rule out scrapping the arts station, saying only: ‘We’re not announcing anything about BBC4 today. ‘We don’t want to close BBC4. What we are doing is making efficiency savings…we’re saving as much money as we possibly can.’ In her report, Miss Bulford complained that although the £145.50 licence fee has remained the same since 2010, the BCB has seen its real terms funding had decreased by 26 per cent because of inflation and increased obligations, such as the need to fund broadband rollout. But John O’Connell, Director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘The BBC should be doing what it can to save money and cut frivolous services that don’t adhere to its public service commitment. ‘Asking for more money through the licence fee is simply not an option when families are already paying a pretty penny for a dying model of broadcasting.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC is making significant management savings - executive director pay is discounted by 50 to 80 per cent against the commercial sector saving in excess of £2.5m per year. ‘Since 2009, the BBC has reduced the number and pay bill of senior managers by more than a third, reducing the pay bill by over £20m per year. ‘Overall, pay restraint, combined with headcount reductions, has saved the BBC over £150m per year.’","Strategy chief James Purnell and finance director Anne Bulford criticised .

Lee Westwood, in action at the Malaysian Open, has criticised the R&A's decision to give the Open to SKY . LOUIS VAN GAAL’S ENGLISH .

Carroll is occasionally a striker for West Ham and last week gave a rather sour interview, criticising Brendan Rodgers’ treatment of him at Liverpool. Carroll was not Anfield standard and it was Rodgers’ job to manage him out of the club, which he did. Carroll’s job now is to play football. You may have noticed that he is currently injured. Again. Andy Carroll goes down injured during Liverpool's 2-0 win over West Ham last month . JURGEN KLOPP .

"America has reached a landmark point as, for the first time in its modern history, most of the babies being born there are non-white. White children aged under one are outnumbered by those from ethnic minorities including blacks, Hispanics, Asians and mixed race, US Census Bureau figures show. Of the four million children born in the US in the 12 months to July 2011, 50.4 per cent were from ethnic minorities. That compares with 37 per cent in 1990. The figures also reveal the prolonged impact of a weak economy, which is resulting in fewer Hispanics entering the U.S. Edging up: The percentage of total births in America has included more and more minorities over the past decade . Changing demographic: A chart showing the breakdown of racial and ethnic minority births for the 12-month period ending July 2011 compared to whites . Roderick Harrison, a former chief of racial statistics at the Census Bureau who is now a sociologist at Howard University, said: 'This is an important landmark. This generation is growing up much more accustomed to diversity than its elders.' In recent years, births have been declining for both whites and minorities as many women held off having children due to the economic slump, although the drop has been larger for whites. The report comes as the Supreme Court prepares to rule on the legality of Arizona's strict immigration law, with many states weighing similar get-tough measures. In flux: A bar chart showing the population projections for the U.S. over the next 40 years. Some now believe ethnic minorities will outnumber whites before 2040 . Mr Harrison said: 'We remain in a dangerous period where those appealing to anti-immigration elements are fueling a divisiveness and hostility that might take decades to overcome.' As a whole, the nation's minority population continues to rise, following a higher-than-expected Hispanic count in the 2010 census. Minorities increased 1.9 per cent to 114.1 million, or 36.6 per cent of the total U.S. population, lifted by prior waves of immigration that brought in young families and boosted the number of Hispanic women in their prime childbearing years. But a recent slowdown in the growth of the Hispanic and Asian populations is shifting notions on when the tipping point in U.S. diversity will come - the time when non-Hispanic whites become a minority. 'Dangerous period': Protesters campaign against Arizona's immigration law outside the U.S. Supreme Court, which is reviewing the state's controversial law . After 2010 census results suggested a crossover as early as 2040, demographers now believe the pivotal moment may be pushed back several years when new projections are released in December. The annual growth rates for Hispanics and Asians fell sharply last year to just over two per cent, roughly half the rates in 2000 and the lowest in more than a decade. The black growth rate stayed flat at 1 per cent. The immigrants staying put in the U.S. for now include Narcisa Marcelino, 34, a single mother who lives with her two daughters, ages 10 and 5, in Martinsburg, West Virginia. After crossing into the U.S. from Mexico in 2000, she followed her brother to the eastern part of the state just outside the Baltimore-Washington region. Identities: Census respondents choose their race by selecting either one option (ie- White alone) or more than one option (ie- White in combination). This chart shows the breakdown of those selections . Fewer white cities: This chart shows that only a handful of cities- like New York, San Diego, LA, San Francisco and Seattle- saw an increase in their non-Hispanic white populations over the past decade . The Martinsburg area is known for hiring hundreds of migrants annually to work in fruit orchards. Its Hispanic growth climbed from 14 per cent to 18 per cent between 2000 and 2005 before shrinking last year to 3.3 per cent, still above the national average. Marcelino says she sells food from her home to make ends meet for her family and continues to hope that one day she will get a hearing with immigration officials to stay legally in the U.S. She aspires to open a restaurant and is learning English at a community college so she can help other Spanish-language speakers. If she is eventually deported, 'it wouldn't be that tragic,' Marcelino said. 'But because the children have been born here, this is their country. And there are more opportunities for them here.' According to the latest data, the percentage growth of Hispanics slowed from 4.2 percent in 2001 to 2.5 percent last year. Their population growth would have been even lower if it weren't for their relatively high fertility rates - seven births for every death. The median age of U.S. Hispanics is 27.6 years. Still the majority: Even though the minority birth rate is changing demographically, the majority race of the overall population remains non-Hispanic white . Rallies about race: Immigration rights have been a hot-button issue in the past decade, as seen as this Los Angeles rally in 2010 (left) and one in Mississippi in 2006 (right). Sociologists fear anti-immigration elements are fuelling a divisiveness that could take decades to overcome . Hispanic Population By State: This map shows what percentage of each state's population in 2010 is Hispanic . Births actually have been declining for both whites and minorities as many women postponed having children during the economic slump. But the drop since 2008 has been larger for whites, who have a median age of 42. The number of white births fell by 11.4 per cent, compared with 3.2 percent for minorities, according to Kenneth Johnson, a sociologist at the University of New Hampshire. Blacks, who comprise about 12.3 per cent of the population, have increased at a rate of about 1 percent each year. In all, 348 of the nation's 3,143 counties, or 1 in 9, have minority populations across all age groups that total more than 50 percent. In a sign of future U.S. race and ethnic change, the number of counties reaching the tipping point increases to more than 690, or nearly 1 in 4, when looking only at the under age 5 population. The census report also found that four states — Hawaii, California, New Mexico and Texas — as well as the District of Columbia have minority populations exceeding 50 per cent. The census estimates used local records of births and deaths, tax records of people moving within the U.S., and census statistics on immigrants. The figures for 'white' refer to those whites who are not of Latino ethnicity.","2011 census data shows 50.4 per cent of births were from ethnic minorities .

"Prolific shoplifters are being tracked by road cameras to stop them stealing in the build up to Christmas. Police are using automatic number plate recognition to crack down on thieves at a time of when retailers see an annual boom in shoplifting. The technology was used to keep shoplifters away from busy shopping centres in Durham this week. Scroll down for video . Police are using automatic number plate recognition to track shoplifters in the build up to Christmas . Teams of police carried out the operation in the city's Arnison Shopping Centre, Belmont Retail Park, Dragonville Retail Park and on patrol in the city centre this week. More than 10,000 covert Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras around the UK photograph and record the registration numbers of 14 million motorists in the UK every day. The cameras are usually used to monitor the movements of stolen cars and known criminals, but are now being used in the battle against shop thefts. Durham police Sgt Jim Cowell said: 'The operation has been a success. We had patrol cars in the main shopping areas around the city.' Officers in north east England have been using the technology this week in a bid to deter theives . He added: 'We deterred potential shoplifters from coming into the area and we are planning on carrying out the operation every day from now on.' The technology is just one of the ways police forces are trying to crack down on festive season thieves. In Pontypridd, Wales, officers are sending Christmas cards to offenders reminding them they are banned from the town's centre. Shoplifting and fraud over the Christmas period costs British retailers more than £1billion, as thieves head out to steal presents, food and alcohol. The crime rose by three per cent last year with the latest figures showing more than 320,000 recorded incidents a year. Tomorrow has been dubbed 'Black Friday' by some retailers, a day of pre-Christmas sales started in the US but now moving to Britain.","Retailers report boom in shoplifting in the build up to festive season .

"A Jack Russell has claimed the title of Britain's oldest dog - thanks to her fussy diet of Peppa Pig pasta shapes and gluten free fish fingers. Meg has reached the ripe old age of 25 by shunning regular dog food in favour of human treats. The pampered pet - who is 113 in dog years - is now believed to be the oldest pooch in the UK following the death of the previous title holder, who died in July aged 23. Doting Owner: Jack Russell, Meg, pictured with her owner David Abrahams, has been named Britain's oldest dog after reaching 113 in dog years . Meg was rescued from a puppy farm 23 years ago by doting owner David Abrahams when she was just 18 months old. She developed a taste for soft food, such as canned Peppa Pig pasta shapes in a tomato sauce, after her teeth began to fail. Her other human favourites include, gluten free fish fingers and roast dinners. Mr Abrahams said: 'I think she's lived so long because she's a tough little cookie and she's had the right diet and exercise. 'The fish fingers and the Peppa Pig pasta have helped her along the way. 'As she got older she got extremely fussy. She won't eat the same meal twice in a row. If you make her a roast beef dinner, the next day she won't eat it. 'With age she is picking at food more. She has a roast dinner sometimes twice a week when we have one. The rest of the time it is varied. 'Sometimes it is cat food, senior dog food, or soft pasta based things. Everyday she has something different.' Mr Abrahams rescued Meg in 1999 and has looked after her at his home in Stoke St Michael, Somerset, ever since. The pet is now 18 months older than the previous title holder of Britain's oldest living pet, a Jack Russell called Daisy which died aged 23-and-a-half in July. Pampered pet:  Meg enjoys a diet of of gluten free fish fingers, roast dinners and canned spaghetti shapes in tomato sauce . Meg's diet of gluten free fish fingers and regular roast dinner has been recognised as contributing to her long life . The Jack Russell turned to Peppa Pig pasta shapes in tomato sauce after developing a taste for soft food because her teeth were failing . Mr Abrahams' partner Maria, 62, said Meg has become quite picky with her food in her twilight years. She said: 'We just feed her what she likes whether it's a selection of dog food or human food. 'She has a roast meal with us on a Sunday, which she absolutely adores, and she can't get enough of carrots or greens vegetables.' David added: 'She can't cope with chews any more so the softer stuff really helps. With dog biscuits, we soften them up with warm water before she can eat them. 'Every time we go to the supermarket we try to think of something different to buy her. 'Her vet recommended softer food because her teeth were playing up. They are very old so we tried her on something soft. 'Is she spoilt? Of course. She is the greatest of little dogs and is truly loved by everyone.' Meg nearly died from pancreatitis a few years ago but pulled through and is now living a healthy lifestyle. Owner David Abrahams admits that Meg is spoilt, but describes her as the 'greatest little dog' who is 'loved by everyone' 'She can still run like a whippet when she wants to but tends to sleep a lot now,' said Mr Abrahams, who runs a motorbike dealers. 'Sometimes we have to prod her in the mornings to make sure she's still with us. 'We're dreading the morning that she's not but at the same time hope that she passes peacefully in her sleep in her favourite little sofa bed. 'She has been a brilliant companion.' Meg's vet Sam Fowlie said: 'It is a rare for a dog to reach such an impressive age and is testament to the love and care that she has received from her owners.' A Guinness Book of Records spokesman said: 'We do not currently have a record allocated for the 'oldest dog living' but we would welcome an application from Meg's owners.'","Meg was rescued from a puppy farm 23 years ago by David Abrahams .

"Rapist footballer Ched Evans has been rejected by Tranmere Rovers, the League Two side facing a relegation dog fight. Tranmere chairman Mark Palios claims to have turned down an approach from associates of the 25-year-old about the possibility of the convicted rapist playing for the club, which is currently second from bottom in the league and six points adrift of safety. The former Wales international was jailed for five years after a jury unanimously agreed he raped a drunk woman in a Rhyl hotel while his friends filmed it in 2011. Evans was released after serving half his sentence but is struggling to find a new club because of the furore over his crime and his lack of contrition. Mark Palios and his wife Nicola, who have became the owners of League Two's Tranmere Rovers. Mr Palios says he was contacted by representatives of rapist Ched Evans about playing for the club . Palios said he had twice been contacted by people on behalf of Evans about possible talks but refused to pursue the idea. Evans continues to protest his innocence and has lodged an appeal with the Criminal Case Review Commission. He was initially given permission by former club Sheffield United to return to train with the club at the request of players’ union, the Professional Footballers Association. Following his release last month, pressure mounted on Sheffield United not to resign the player or welcome him back to its grounds. New life: The former professional's fiancee Natasha Massey has said 'all he wanted to do' was return to his career and Vicky Pryce says he had 'served his time' so should be able to start again . Outrage: Jessica Ennis-Hill (left) vowed to have her name removed from one of Sheffield United's stands and Charlie Webster (right) resigned her patronage over the issue . A string of its patrons tendered their resignations over the issue, with Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill vowing to have her name removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane should he be reinstated. Following the backlash - 160,000 people signed a petition against it - the club retracted its offer last week. Palios, former chief executive of the Football Association, and wife Nicola took control at Tranmere in August. He said in a statement released to the Liverpool Echo: ‘Tranmere has not been approached by Ched Evans or his management team to discuss him joining the club. Career: The striker, pictured on Monday, who used to play for Sheffield United, had his invitation to train at the club revoked . ‘However, on two occasions persons with a connection with Ched Evans offered to facilitate a discussion if I wished to pursue that. ‘I strongly believe in the general principle that people have a right to rehabilitation after serving a sentence for a crime. ‘However, I also take the view that whether any particular club would wish to employ someone who has been convicted of a very serious crime is a subjective decision for the club to take after considering all the circumstances, and that there is no simple right or wrong answer. ‘Nicola and I are trying to re-establish the brand of Tranmere as a family-friendly club and bringing Ched Evans in would clearly have alienated a significant number of supporters. ‘It would also have inevitably embroiled the club in much controversy and distraction, at a time when we need to keep a complete focus on rebuilding the club and setting firm foundations for the future. ‘I therefore took the view that it would not be in the best interests of the club to seek a dialogue with Mr Evans, notwithstanding his undoubted footballing talents. ‘Neither I nor the club will be making any further comment on this matter.’ Tranmere allowed Clayton McDonald, who was acquitted of rape when tried alongside Evans, to join the club on non-contract terms earlier in the season, but he was released after just one appearance. Ched Evans' loyal fiancee Natasha Massey has stood by him and is running the campaign to have his conviction overturned. Ms Massey appeared alongside Evans in a recent video he made, in which he insisted he was guilty only of infidelity - not the rape he was jailed for. Two years ago the victim had to start a new life away from her friends and family in north Wales after nine people were convicted of illegally naming her in 2012, but now may have to do the same again. The young woman was named at least 6,000 times on Twitter alone following the conviction of Wales international Evans and was labelled a ‘slag’, ‘tramp’, ‘bitch’ and ‘whore’. Police put her ‘relocation package’ together after her lifelong anonymity — protection afforded to anyone who has made and allegation of a sexual assault — was breached on the internet. Some of the abuse amounted to ‘psychological GBH’, to use the description of one senior detective, which left the girl ‘traumatised’. May 30, 2011: CCTV shows footballer Clayton McDonald meeting victim outside a kebab shop in Rhyl at around 4am, before taking a cab with her to a nearby Premier Inn. On the way he texts friend Ched Evans to say he's 'got a bird'. Mr McDonald and Evans both had intercourse with the girl, and at one point two other men tried to film it though a window. After waking up in the hotel room with no memory of the incident, the victim went to police, and later the same day Evans and Mr McDonald are both arrested. July 26, 2011:  Evans and Mr McDonald are charged with rape, which they both deny. April 11, 2012: Evans and Mr McDonald take the stand for the first time at Caernarfon Crown Court. April 20: Mr McDonald is acquitted of rape, while Evans is found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison. During the trial Evans told the court that he had gone to the hotel after getting a text from Mr McDonald, and let himself into the room where he found the pair having sex. He claimed to have watched them before having sex with the victim himself, while two other men watched through the window and attempted to film it. April 23: The victim is named for the first time online by supporters of Evans, who begin bombarding her with abuse that police will later compare to 'virtual GBH'. Officers subsequently take the unusual step of giving the woman a false identity and moving her away from her home - protection usually reserved for high-profile murderers released from jail. August: Evans has request to appeal his conviction turned down, though this is later overturned by the Court of Appeal in London. November, 2013: Evans continues to deny guilt and recruits new legal team to help clear his name. October 17, 2014: He is released from jail after serving half of his sentence and returns home to Rhyl where a bouncy castle is pictured being delivered to his parents' house, but is later taken away. October 18: Reports surface that Evans has been offered a £500,000 contract to re-sign for Sheffield United, though the club later deny the rumours. November 11: After a request from the Professional Footballers' Association, Sheffield United agree to allow Evans to return to the club to train, but refuse to say whether he will be signed. The same day patron Charlie Webster, who was abused as a child, walks away from the club. November 12: Lindsay Graham, another club patron, cuts her ties with the club along with another unnamed patron as 150,000 sign petition saying Evans should not be allowed to play again. November 13: Jessica Ennis-Hill asks for her name to be removed from one of the club's stands, leading to abuse on Twitter. November 17: Karl Massey, the millionaire father of Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey, says he will offer the former-footballer a job at one of his firms if the club will not have him back . November 20: Sheffield United confirm that they have withdrawn the offer to allow Evans to train at their ground. November 22:  The Ministry of Justice said while it cannot comment on individual prisoners, in general terms the terms of a sex offender's licence would render it near impossible to work abroad, scuppering any hopes that Evans may be signed overseas for the remainder of his sentence.","Chairman claims to have turned down an approach from associates .

"The Royal Air Force Museum is set to open a new permanent exhibition to commemorate the role British airmen and aircraft played during the First World War. The First World War in the Air exhibition, which opens a week today, will tell the incredible stories of men and women who served and protected our nation with the air force. Set in a Grade II listed building which was used as an aircraft factory for First World War planes, the exhibition shows off the RAF Museum's staggering collection of British and German planes, archive film, photographs and wartime paraphernalia to show just how vital the air force was for Britain during the Great War. The RAF Museum in Hendon, north-west London, is set to  a new permanent First World War exhibition next week, with British and German fighter planes on display . The exhibition, which will include replicas of the Albatros D.Va - used by the Germans - commemorate the role of British airmen and aircraft during WWI . The RAF Museum's Vernon Creek tries on leather and fur replica flying uniforms which will be a part of The First World War in the Air exhibition . The Albatros D.Va was first built in 1917, with around 2,500 of the fighters used during the First World War by the Luftstreitkräfte - the German air force . The First World War in the Air exhibition, which opens a week today, will also display British planes such as the Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 . Set in a Grade II listed building which was used as an aircraft factory for First World War planes, the exhibition shows off the RAF Museum's staggering collection of planes . Visitors will be able to marvel at replicas of classic war planes such as the Albatros D.Va and the Sopwith Camel - aircraft which did battle against each other for the Germans and Allies respectively between 1914 and 1918. The exhibition takes place at the RAF Museum in Hendon, north-west London, which has been described as the 'birthplace of aerial power'. The site's long and rich history started in 1862, when British flight enthusiast Henry Coxwell took a short flight in a hot air balloon from a field where the museum now stands. The plot passed through the hands of The London Aerodrome Company before it was sold to aviation pioneer Claude Grahame-White in 1911, who oversaw the site's pivotal role in the development of air power and pilots for both the Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Flying Corps who trained there. In just 10 years, driven by the requirements of the conflict, aviation technology developed from being barely able to cross the English Channel in 1909 to crossing the Atlantic in 1919. The exhibition, designed by Ralph Appelbaum Associates, explores what it was like to be involved in the earliest days of military aviation through the story of Britain's air services, the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service. The exhibition, which marks the centenary of the First World War, also houses a series of portraits of crew, paying tribute to the thousands who gave their lives in the Royal Flying Corps . Planes, film, photographs and wartime paraphernalia on display show how vital the air force was for Britain during WWI . The exhibition takes place at the RAF Museum in Hendon, north-west London, which has been described as the 'birthplace of aerial power' Britain's air power expanded massively during the First World War, from barely 2,000 in the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service in 1914 to 290,000 in the RAF after the war . The site's long and rich history started in 1862, when British flight enthusiast Henry Coxwell took a short flight in a hot air balloon from a field where the museum's exhibition now stands . The site played a pivotal role in the development of air power and pilots for both the Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Flying Corps who trained there before the outbreak of war . In just 10 years, driven by the requirements of the conflict, aviation technology developed from being barely able to cross the English Channel in 1909 to crossing the Atlantic in 1919, flying planes such as those seen here at the new exhibition . These two organisations merged on April 1 1918 to create the Royal Air Force - the first national air service in existence. Fascinating displays incorporate the experiences of pilots, ground crew and factory workers to help tell the story of the beginnings of military flight. Exhibits include iconic aircraft such as the Sopwith Camel, the Fokker D VII and an example of an aircraft that was built in the factory at Colindale, the Avro 504 - the most-produced plane during WWI. The thrilling story of the evolution of flight, from the early days of experimentation to full-force fighting machines, is underpinned by stories of people 'on the ground'. The exhibition also explores the extraordinary expansion of Britain's air services, the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service, from 1,800 men in 1914 to a Royal Air Force of 290,000 men and women at the end of the war in 1918. Historical documents, such as First World War casualty cards, casualty forms and muster rolls, are likely to interest genealogists and people trying to track down relatives' actions during the 1914-1918 war. It can be viewed at www.rafmuseumstoryvault.com. The Rocking Fuselage training system (pictured) was used to ready pilots for the turbulence and G-forces faced by pilots they would face . Fascinating displays draw on the experiences of pilots, ground crew and factory workers to tell the story of the beginnings of military flight . Sneak peek: The exhibition opens to the public a week today, but a lucky few have already poked their noses around inside . Replica motorcycle courier gloves used by the military between 1914 and 1918 are also on show at the First World War in the Air exhibition . Karen Whitting, director of public programmes at the Royal Air Force Museum, said: '100 years on from the outbreak of the First World War, the narrative of our First World War in the Air exhibition resonates locally, nationally and internationally. 'The Museum, therefore, looks forward to sharing this incredible story with both local visitors and audiences from across the globe. It is particularly fitting that we mark this anniversary in the approach to 2018, the centenary of the founding of the Royal Air Force.' Blondel Cluff, Chair of the Heritage Lottery Fund London Committee, said: 'Thanks to lottery players, this new permanent exhibition means that the RAF Museum will be able to play a full part in marking the centenary of the First World War, bringing to the fore an important but currently less well known aspect of the War.' The First World War in the Air exhibition was funded by a £898,558 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.","Royal Air Force Museum opens a new display to commemorate the role of air power during the First World War .

"Leslie Podd has been jailed for throwing £40,000 of drugs into HMP Northumberland . The brother of a prison inmate has been caught on CCTV hurling £40,000 worth of cannabis, cocaine and vodka over a jail fence to help pay off a drug debt racked up by his sibling. Leslie Podd chucked the drugs and alcohol in empty sports drinks bottles, along with syringes and mobile phones, over the wall of HMP Northumberland. The haul included 1.5 kilos of cannabis, worth up to £22,500 in prison, as well as cocaine, diazepam, subutex tablets, temazepam, steroids and seven mobile phones. Podd had been persuaded to carry out the offence to help pay off a drug debt for his brother, a prisoner in HMP Durham, Newcastle Crown Court heard. CCTV filmed at the Northumberland prison shows Podd hurling the contraband on to a patch of grass near the laundry room. Prisoners hid the four bottles inside the jail, but staff found them in a toilet cistern and a laundry box. Now Podd has been jailed after pleading guilty to nine offences of conveying banned items into a prison. Recorder Nigel Sangster QC told him: 'You were the stooge given the job to throw it over the wall but you took part in a serious offence. 'Those sent to prison are not meant to have drugs or mobile phones or alcohol in prison. The fact there is so much of it in prison is because people like you make sure people in prison get these things.' The court heard Podd went to HMP Northumberland in a car driven by someone else last April. They immediately aroused suspicion by turning up after visiting time had started. Staff watched on CCTV as Podd eventually got out of the car and walked past the visitors' entrance and headed round the side of the prison towards the laundry block. Podd was caught in CCTV  lobbing a vast array of narcotics, syringes, mobile phones and vodka into HMP Northumberland, hidden in plastic sports drinks bottles . The haul included 1.5 kilos of cannabis, worth up to £22,500 in prison, as well as cocaine, diazepam, subutex tablets, temaz-epam, steroids and seven mobile phones . Podd was caught in the act on CCTV at the Northumberland prison throwing the bottles crammed with contraband on to a patch of grass near the laundry room . Emma Dowling, prosecuting, said: 'He was seen while walking across the car park to be using a mobile phone and had a carrier bag in the other hand. He is seen to skirt round some bushes and approach the perimeter fencing and throws four bottles over the fence.' Staff monitoring the CCTV raised the alarm and all prisoners were stopped and searched. One bottle was found hidden in a toilet cistern while the rest were found in a laundry box. Miss Dowling said the doors to the laundry room had to be kept open so the prisoners didn't get too hot and they had prised open a piece of gauze in order to get outside and collect the illicit items. Newcastle Crown Court heard Podd had been persuaded to carry out the offence to help pay off a drug debt for his brother, a prisoner in HMP Durham . Inside the bottles was 1.5 kilos of cannabis resin, worth up to £22,500 in prison, 168 subutex tablets, worth £16,000, 105 diazepam worth up to £1,000, 2.82g of cocaine, 2g of skunk cannabis, 48 temazepam, 55 steroids, seven mobile phones, miniature bottles of vodka and some syringes. Podd, of Cairo Street, Sunderland, who has 123 previous convictions, including one from 10 years ago for possessing heroin with intent to supply, was jailed for three years. Nick Lane, defending, said: 'It's clear others were involved. His brother had a drug debt to satisfy and his brother was in custody. Threats were made and he was given the package and agreed to throw it over the wall. 'It's a large quantity of drugs but there is no evidence he could have benefited any further than the threats against his brother not being carried out.'","Leslie Podd chucked the drugs over the wall of HMP Northumberland .

"Louis van Gaal prepared for the Barclays Premier League run-in by admitting that he does not have a reliable centre forward. Manchester United face Sunderland at Old Trafford on Saturday at the start of a 12-game run that will decide whether they make the Champions League places and whether Van Gaal’s first season at the club can be considered a success. With United’s defence one of the tightest in the Premier League, Van Gaal knows that goals at the other end could decide his team’s fate and agreed that his centre-forward trio of Radamel Falcao, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie have not reached the required levels this season. Louis van Gaal claims he does not have a reliable centre forward for his Champions League chasing side . The United manager said: ‘It is true because I cannot deny it, Robin van Persie cannot deny it, Falcao cannot deny it and Rooney is not playing there much any more, but we cannot deny that at this moment we don’t have a striker who scores 20 goals in the season. ‘They could be having an unlucky year and I have to take that into account and I have to decide, with my staff, if it’s these aspects or other aspects that is causing this.’ Despite the injury problems that have caused United so many problems defensively this season, it is the attacking play of Van Gaal’s team that is causing supporters to be concerned. Van Gaal claims his side are short of a 20-goal a season striker as they prepare for their weekend game . Wayne Rooney and Jonny Evans share a joke in training at the Aon Training Complex in Manchester . Currently, they see little of the fluency and excitement traditionally associated with United despite the investment in attacking players made last summer. Falcao is likely to get a chance with Rooney on Saturday, as Van Persie is out for a few weeks with an ankle problem and young James Wilson has a dead leg. Van Gaal also admitted that he needs to see more from record signing Angel di Maria and conceded that the former Real Madrid player is struggling to adapt to what his manager wants. ‘He needs to go through the process and at the end he shall be much better,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I know that he is a very creative player and you can see this from the statistics. Angel di Maria and Rooney are put through their paces as Manchester United training gets underway . Van Gaal has conceded that summer signing Di Maria is struggling to adapt to what his manager wants . ‘He needs that space and I give him that space, but he needs to do things with his brain and that is a learning process, not only with Di Maria but with all the players. 'Every team has its philosophy, which is why some players are better with one club but not another. When you buy players you need to give them time to adapt to the culture of England, to the rhythm of the Premier League, because that is a big difference to somewhere like Spain.’ An under pressure Radamel Falcao is put through his paces as Manchester United train ahead of Sunderland . Asked if trying to change the way a player like Di Maria thinks risks damaging him, Van Gaal was unwavering. ‘You have to ask the player that,’ he said. ‘I give a lot of space to all the players because in an attacking way they create more when they are free. 'But when you want to win as a team you have to defend also and he has to do that. It is not always the fault of the manager when a player is not performing well, I can tell you!’ Luke Shaw and Juan Mata are put through their paces as the Manchester United duo look to Sunderland .","Louis van Gaal claims Manchester United are in need of a reliable striker .

"Police were called after a boy of just ten took a knife into a junior school and produced it in front of other children. The youngster had the Swiss army blade on him at Abbotswood Junior School in Totton, Hants - on the edge of the New Forest, which officers said was visible to fellow pupils. There are claims the knife was also used to threaten another child. Concerned parents have since spoken out in anger at the incident while others have decided to keep their children away from Abbotswood altogether. Police are investigating after the ten year-old carried a Swiss army knife into Abbotswood Junior School (pictured) in Totton, Hants . One mother who did not want to be named, said: 'A pupil threatened another pupil with a knife in the school grounds. 'A few parents are worried and have not sent their children to school today. 'We all think parents should be made aware of this via a letter but they are keeping it quiet. 'What was this child doing with a knife, even taking it to school? Our children need to be made aware of the dangers of weapons.' Hampshire Constabulary are refusing to discuss further claims one of the children was threatened with the blade but parents remain worried for their children's safety. Another 'horrified' mother said the boy had not returned to school since the incident, which occurred before lessons started. Totton town and district councillor Di Brook, a former chairman of governors at the school, said: 'It's horrific that something like this can happen at a junior school. 'You hear about inner city secondary schools being equipped with metal scanners but someone of this age carrying a knife is very worrying.' Officers said the knife was 'visible' to fellow children which has led to parents voicing their anger and dismay (picture posed by models) Totton county councillor David Harrison added: 'This sounds like a very serious and unusual incident. 'It's something that should never happen anywhere, let alone in a school environment.' Head teacher Glenn Moore issued a brief statement but made no mention of the incident. It said: 'The safety of children in our school is of the utmost importance and we take every step possible to ensure they are secure and well cared for. 'While we are not able to discuss individual cases when incidents occur on school premises they are thoroughly investigated and dealt with appropriately. It is illegal to carry a knife over 3 inches long (7.62 cm) in public without good reason . While a Swiss Army knife would not typically exceed 3 inches in length, it is also illegal to use any knife in a threatening way . Certain types of blades, including switch or butterfly knives, disguised knives or samurai swords, are completely banned and should not be carried, bought or sold . It is also an offence to sell a knife of any kind to anyone under 18 . The maximum penalty for an adult carrying a knife is 4 years in prison and a fine of £5,000 . 'With teachers and support staff working to very clear and comprehensive guidance that includes child protection, anti-bullying and positive behaviour policies the school is able to respond quickly and take appropriate action when required.' A police spokesman said that a ten-year-old boy 'had been spoken to' after taking a Swiss army knife to school. Councillor Peter Edgar, Hampshire County Council's executive member for education, said: 'Any incident which potentially compromises the safety of a child is taken extremely seriously. 'Follow-up action is taken immediately to ensure firstly that children are safe, and secondly that if appropriate, any wider ramifications are discussed with the wider school population.' Abbotswood, which has a little over 600 pupils, is a foundation junior school for seven to 11 year olds. The school displays a proud statement from school inspectors Ofsted on its homepage, who write pupils 'enjoy coming to school and behave well'. It reads: 'The outstanding care, guidance and support, along with the exciting opportunities provided by the improved curriculum, are motivating, engaging and having a significant impact on the well-being of all pupils. 'As a result, they enjoy coming to school and behave well.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Police have spoken to the pupil at Abbotswood Junior School in Totton .

"It was as an email to 15 friends from a woman wanting to share the 'most insane experience of my life' and 'probably the best story I will ever get to tell'. But Beejoli Shah has become has become a web sensation after her claims of having her toes sucked by director Quentin Tarantino have gone viral. The young woman has gone into hiding and her social networking pages have been taken down since her email spread to inboxes across the world. Scroll down for video . Viral sensation: Beejoli Shah's email, which included an attached image showing photo booth snaps of her and Quentin Tarantino, has gone viral . But MailOnline can reveal that the 23-year-old is a University of California Berkeley politics graduate working for a television production company in Santa Monica. A copy of Miss Shah's resume, seen by MailOnline, shows that the young woman has had several brushes with fame, including working as an intern at former LA publicist PMK/HBH, which represented stars such as Johnny Depp, Jennifer Aniston, Daniel Craig, and Gwyneth Paltrow. The former Berkeley student was an anchor on her college television station and appeared as a contestant on game show Wheel of Fortune. Miss Shah also worked for former Democratic Party senate candidate Joe Alioto Veronese in his 2008 campaign. In the email, which has gone viral, Miss Shah told how she met Mr Tarantino, 48, at a party in 'The Hills' before they went back to his house where she claims he sucked her toes. Fame hungry? Beejoli Shah appeared as a contestant on television game show Wheel of Fortune . Aspiring presenter: Miss Shah was a sports anchor on her college's student television station CalTV . 'I'm making a drink and realize the pasty tall fellow pouring orange juice into my glass is the man himself, QT,' she wrote. 'Realizing I kind of have to go for at it this point, in all my nerd glory blurt out: ""I'm sure everyone tells you this but I f**king loved Reservoir Dogs.' Director: The email claims that Quentin Tarantino, 48, sucked the 23-year-old's toes while he performed a sex act . She claims that the pair kissed in a kitchen at the party after she told him that she did not like his Kill Bill films. According to the email, Mr Tarantino said: 'Wow...I don't think anyone has said that to my face about my seminal films.' She replied: 'Perhaps it's because you call them your seminal films. Shouldn't you wait for someone else to say that?' Before he said, 'You know, you've got a mouth on you. I like that,' and the Oscar-winning film director put his arm around her and kissed her. 'At some point in our public makeout, Jamie Foxx comes over and without acknowledging me goes, ""Yo QT, ready to roll?"" Quentin looks at me and says ""Want to come to my house?"",' Miss Shah wrote in the email. The couple went back to the director's house where they took pictures of themselves in a photo booth, which Miss Shah attached to the email as 'proof that this story even happened'. Miss Shah said that she 'started panicking' when Mr Tarantino suggested they head to bed because 'the makeouts were really losing their appeal because you can only be sweated on so much'. She then included a graphic description of his private parts and claims that Mr Tarantino asked if he could suck her toes while he masturbated. 'And thus began the weirdest ten . minutes of my life - having my feet made out with by an Oscar winning . filmmaker while he pleasured himself,' she wrote. 'In the morning, I snooped through Quentin's belongings while he was in the bathroom and now know his e-mail address,' she added.

"An elementary school in Massachusetts reversed their controversial decision to cancel their annual trip to see The Nutcracker because parents complained it had 'religious content.' The Butler Elementary School in Belmont has a long standing tradition of going to see the classic ballet but parents complained to the school that there was a Christmas tree on stage and therefore was an inappropriate play. WHDH reports that the cancellation was reversed after a PTA meeting on Tuesday night where several parents pushed for the school to change their mind. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Christmas controversy: Butler Elementary School almost cancelled their annual trip to The Nutcracker for fear the Christmas Tree on stage was inappropriate . Upset parents said that the school cancelled the trip without telling anyone officially but that word eventually spread. 'I went once as a kid as well. I think it's anybody's choice. They should still offer it but you don't have to go if you don't like,' said parent Adam Campana. 'I've had four kids go to the school, my fourth is here, and they've done nothing but enjoy it,' said parent Laurie Manjikian. Co-President Barbara Bulfoni told reporters, 'In the past years there were parent’s complaints as 'The Nutcracker' has a religious content. I think we clarified with the parents.' One PTA board member said she was so miffed by the controversy that she may step down from her position. Those who do not wish for their children to see the ballet are allowed to opt out.

"Most sportsmen will try to put a positive spin on things, no matter how bad they get. Sometimes the truth is unpalatable. For manager Manuel Pellegrini and his Manchester City players, however, the lessons of Tuesday night’s home defeat by Barcelona were clear. Once again they had come up short and they head to Spain for a second leg on March 18 knowing something much, much better is required. So when City’s French defender Gael Clichy was asked the key question, there was no great point trying to sugar-coat anything. Gael Clichy attempt to stop Lionel Messi in his tracks as the Barcelona forward goes on the attack . The Manchester City defender was sent off in the second half as the home side pressed for an equaliser . Luis Suarez had given Barcelona the lead from a tight angle after the ball fell kindly to him in the City box . Have City, Clichy was asked, improved at all since last year’s 2-0 defeat at home by Barca at this stage of the Champions League? ‘It’s hard to say that,’ said Clichy. ‘If you look at this game they had more possession, created chances and we ran after the ball a lot. I don’t know if we have improved since last year. ‘We are privileged to be in a club that wants to improve year after year. And to improve is to go further in the Champions League. Twice in a row we have played Barcelona. They are a big team and know how to play those kind of games. Eventually we will get there. ‘Those clubs have been built for several years — 20, 30, 40 years — and this is only the sixth season for us but that’s no excuse. The owner wants to improve quickly, so we have to improve quickly. Suarez celebrates the crucial first away goal after finishing emphatically past Joe Hart . Suarez slides in ahead of Martin Demichelis to flick Jordi Alba's cross past Hart to double the lead . ‘If we play as we did in the second half, everything is possible. It’s not going to be easy, but we are going to try really hard.’ Given that Clichy had been sent off only an hour earlier, the former Arsenal player’s honesty was welcome. City did improve after half-time but by then they were 2-0 down and all but out of the competition once again. Goalkeeper Joe Hart, whose last-minute penalty save from Lionel Messi prevented another Barcelona goal, admitted City had panicked when their plan to suffocate Barca high up the field failed. City’s owners — and Pellegrini — face a conundrum in that while few really thought they would beat Barcelona, improvement is expected. And currently it is hard for Pellegrini to suggest there has been any. Sergio Aguero fires past Marc Andre ter Stegen to put Manchester City back in the game . Aguero celebrates with James Milner after scoring what could turn out to be a vital goal in the context of the tie with 20 minutes to go . City bought three players last summer. Bacary Sagna has not managed to displace Pablo Zabaleta at full back, Fernando would perhaps not have played on Tuesday had Yaya Toure not been suspended, and £30million-plus French defender Eliaquim Mangala has been the biggest disappointment of all. Football director Txiki Begiristain heads City’s recruitment team and must accept some responsibility. Pellegrini, however, will ultimately feel the greatest pressure. There is no question mark over his future right now but this is a club with a very clear idea of where it wants to get to and when. Some may question Pellegrini’s decision to play 4-4-2 on Tuesday. City looked short in central midfield where Fernando and James Milner had a dreadful evening. More startling was the way City seemed to have learned so little from last year. As Barcelona picked them apart in the first half, it was with the same tactics we witnessed a year ago. Pellegrini will thank no-one for saying it, but it’s hard to imagine a team coached by Jose Mourinho being dismantled like this. Manchester City were beaten 2-0 at the Etihad by Barcelona in last season's last-16 . Manuel Pellegrini's side were reduced to 10 men in that game too after Marin Demichelis . ‘I have played Barcelona many times and even if you played five in the middle you always feel a player short because they know how to move, how to keep the ball,’ added Clichy. ‘The choice of the manager to go from the first minute with two strikers showed we wanted to play offensively and score goals. We didn’t, and we didn’t start well. ‘We have to carry on like this because that is the way we want to play and that is the way we are going to win things.’ City must now forget Barcelona. The return leg is three weeks away and on Sunday they travel to Merseyside for a Barclays Premier League meeting with Liverpool. Last season Liverpool won this fixture 3-2 but they are in Europe tonight and City’s two days of extra rest may give them the edge. The Premier League is safe and familiar territory for City. They understand it. Sooner or later, however, Pellegrini must find a way to expand his team’s horizons. Manchester City’s match statistics were similar in some respects to those from last season’s performance against Barcelona. They had one more shot on target on Tuesday (4) than in last season’s match at the Etihad and the same number of shots off target (4). Their possession was up on last season, though still low — 37.9 per cent compared to 31.6 per cent in 2014. However, they did get 20 crosses into the penalty area as opposed to 11 last season and had eight corners on Tuesday night against one in 2014. PS Barcelona’s passing success rate was down on the same fixture last year — 88.9 per cent of 686 passes compared to 92.4 per cent in 2014. This was largely down to Luis Suarez, who scored two goals but found a team-mate with only 72.7 per cent of his passes. Without his erratic input, Barcelona’s average was 90.3 per cent.","Manchester City beat Barcelona 2-1 at the Etihad on Tuesday night .

"Destroyed: This iPhone charger started giving off smoke and melted soon after James Ward plugged it in at his home in Romford, Essex . An iPhone user has told of his shock after he saw the device's charger melt in his hand. Smoke started billowing from the end of James Ward's phone cable just a few minutes after he plugged it in to the mains. The cable then began to melt, instantly filling his home in Romford, Essex with the smell of burning rubber. The 25-year-old electrician says he . knew instantly that the device had a serious fault, and worried for the . safety of his young daughter. 'I started to panic,' he said. 'I know all about electrics, and stuff like that really shouldn't happen. 'I . normally plug my phone in and go to bed, but I had a couple of emails . to check. If I had gone to sleep, I dread to think what would have . happened. 'I've got an 18-month-old daughter - the consequences of what could have happened don't bear thinking about.' He bought the iPhone 5 and official 'Lightning' charger from an EE store about six months ago. Danger: Mr Ward worries that the malfunction could have seriously harmed his family . 'I don't know what caused it to heat up, I didn't do anything different and the cable hadn't frayed at all,' Mr Ward said. 'I'm never going to leave my phone unattended again - I don't want to put my family at risk and this happening once was once too often for my liking.'

"Disgraced Former Rangers owner Craig Whyte has been arrested in Mexico in a major police raid . Disgraced Former Rangers owner Craig Whyte has been arrested in Mexico in a major police raid, after he failed to attend a London court hearing over a £17million debt. Two international arrest warrants have been issued  for the 43-year-old businessman in connection with the sale of Rangers Football Club in 2011. Whyte, who is understood to have been living in the central American country for several months, failed to turn up at the Royal Courts of Justice on November 20, where he was due to appear in a case brought by London-based ticketing agency Ticketus. The firm gave Whyte almost £27 million to help him buy Rangers when he took control of the club in 2011, with the agreement that Ticketus would be paid back from the revenue from ticket sales. But Rangers went into administration in February the following year, and Ticketus went to court, alleging that Whyte had had deliberately misled them ahead of entering into their agreement. Whyte disputed the agency' claims, but in April 2013 a High Court  ruled against him prior to a trial after Ticketus argued that he had 'no real prospect' of mounting a successful defence. He was ordered to pay £17.6 million. Mr Justice Newey charged Whyte with contempt of court after he failed to appear for the London hearing last week, with a custodial order of 28 days attached to the warrant. The Motherwell-born financier had previously vowed to surrender to police and assist officers investigating the Rangers takeover, saying: ‘I will return to Britain at the beginning of December and hand myself in for questioning.’ Following the hearing a spokeswoman for Ticketus said: ‘Today’s court hearing is part of Ticketus’ continued activity to enforce its judgement of April 2013 for damages of £17.7million plus interest and costs against Craig Whyte as it looks to recover funds for its investors. ‘This reflects the total amount Ticketus invested through the ticket purchase agreement it entered into with Rangers Football Club under Craig Whyte’s ownership. Motherwell-born financier Craig Whyte, who who is understood to have been living in Mexico for several months, has been issued with two arrest warrants in connection with the sale of Rangers  in 2011 . ‘Ticketus confirms that the court today issued a warrant for Craig Whyte’s arrest, having previously issued a suspended committal order on 29 September returnable today after finding Craig Whyte to be guilty of contempt of court.’ A separate second arrest warrant was issued by the Crown Office in Scotland  on charges of fraud in connection with his purchase of the club from Sir David Murray in 2011. Four men appeared in court earlier this month charged with fraudulent activity linked to the sale of the club three years ago. Gary Withey, 50, David Whitehouse, 49, Paul Clark, 50, and David Grier, 53, were granted bail following a hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court.

"Just over 8,000 years ago a huge landslide occurred off the coast of Norway, known as the Storegga Slide. The event created a catastrophic tsunami, with waves almost half as high as the Statue of Liberty, that battered Britain and other land masses. And now the most accurate computer model ever made of the tsunami suggests that it wiped out the remaining inhabitants of a set of low-lying landmass known as Doggerland off the coast of the UK. Scroll down for animation of the tsunami . A new model by researchers at Imperial College London has revealed the devastating effects of a tsunami caused by a landslide off the Norwegian coast over 8,000 years ago. It's believed the event would have devastated an area of low-lying land known as Doggerland that once connected Britain to mainland Europe . The new study from researchers at Imperial College London is being presented at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly in Vienna this week. Using advanced computer modelling and paleobathymetry - the study of underwater depths through history - they describe how deadly the tsunami would have been. And they conclude it would have spelled disaster for the remaining inhabitants of Doggerland. ‘The research we’ve done is using advanced computer modelling to look at the Storegga slide,’ Dr Jon Hill, one of the authors on the study, tells MailOnline. Doggerland is a former landmass that once connected Britain to mainland Europe. It is believed to have disappeared after being flooded by rising sea levels in about 6,500 BC. It was likely home to Mesolithic tribes (10,000 to 5,000 BC). Since 1931, a number of discoveries have been made in the North Sea that suggest clues as to what the landmass would have been like. The remains of mammoths, lions and other animals, in addition to prehistoric tools and weapons, provides evidence for settlement by humans and animals. ‘We’re the first to discover dissymmetry at the time, which no model has done before. ‘So we’re able to quantify what the tsunami looked like at Doggerland – no other study has predicted what the wave would have looked like.’ The huge wave that was created in the Storegga Slide occurred when a large chunk of coastal shelf 180 miles (290 km) long fell into the sea. The slide was a single event 8,200 years ago, creating a wave that travelled across the Norwegian Sea in a few hours. Fifteen hours later, the wave would have reached Belgium and Holland. Dr Hill said it would have been equivalent to the 2011 Japanese tsunami in its scale. The landmass once connected Britain with Europe, and is believed to have been inhabited by Mesolithic tribes. Artificats recovered from the North Sea provide evidence as to the land's habitation. The tsunami is thought to have wiped out the last people to occupy the area, who were by then restricted to an island . Waves at Doggerland would have been five metres high, as opposed to 10 metres in the Japanese tsunami, as the land was so low-lying just a few metres above sea level. ‘It would have been completely inundated by a 5-metre wave,’ Dr Hill explains. ‘If you put a 5-metre wave towards Doggerland it would have been devastated.’ Archaeological evidence for this area is relatively sparse at the moment. So far, we are relying mostly on finds made by fisherman. But the evidence heavily suggests it was inhabited and, according to Dr Vince Gaffney of the . University of Birmingham who authored the book Europe’s Lost World: The Rediscovery of Doggerland, they would have ‘suffered dramatically.’ ‘If we look at what the study tells us they’re talking about waves that are, in Scotland, as much as 40 metres high,’ he says. ‘The inhabitants of any low-lying areas like Doggerland would have suffered dramatically if hit by something of that size.’ Divers from St Andrews University, searching for Doggerland, the underwater country dubbed 'Britain's Atlantis', in 2012. The underwater area is hard to explore as it is a busy sea lane with murky waters . St Andrews University's artists' impression of life in Doggerland. Further research will be need in order to discern just how many people were living on Doggerland, but it's unlikely many or any survived the deadly tsunami caused by the Storegga Slide . Dr Gaffney continues, however, that is hard to know exactly the extent of habitation on Doggerland because it is very inaccessible. Described as ‘Britain’s Atlantis’ it is now located under busy sea lanes in murky water. Thus, according to Dr Gaffney, ‘we know little about the people who inhabited these areas.’ Dr Hill says that modelling tsunamis of this type are important for understanding our history. But they can also provide us with data on what we can expect from similar events in future. Although he stresses no such event is likely to occur any time soon, the UK is susceptible to such dangers. ‘Part of the research is to find out what would happen as the oceans warm,’ he says. ‘Rising sea levels are an indicator but there’s no correlation between rising sea levels and tsunamis.’ The chances of another event on the scale of the Storegga Slide happening soon is, he says, ‘not likely to happen at all.’ Dr Gaffney adds, though, that these events are known to have occurred throughout history. ‘We sometimes think we’re a safe place to live in the UK,’ he says. ‘But sometimes there are risks even in Britain and that’s worth noting.’","Research has modelled in detail a historic and deadly tsunami .

"No matter how poorly they play, Louis van Gaal's Manchester United team are proving devilishly hard to beat. Here at a bouncing Deepdale, United were for long periods as feeble, as poor, as we have seen in recent times. A goal down as the hour mark came and went, United were in very real danger of being tossed out of the FA Cup by a team from League One. Without so much as a shot on goal to their name at half-time, there was no real reason to think United would survive the one from Preston left back Scott Laird that flew past David de Gea in the 47th minute. Wayne Rooney converts a penalty late on to seal a 3-1 victory - his first goal for Manchester United in 952 minutes .

Wayne Rooney was back up front but to no avail. United had been awful. Again. Radamel Falcao had been invisible. Again. The Colombian wasn't even on the field as United mounted their comeback. There is something about Van Gaal's team, though, that is preventing current difficulties reaching crisis level. The United manager called it 'team spirit'. It was 'incredible', he said. That may be overstating things a little. His players are paid to win football matches. If they don't have team spirit then what do they have? Nevertheless, here again United found a way to get through as first Ander Herrera and then Marouane Fellaini scored goals that turned looming defeat in to victory and secured a quarter final tie at home to Arsenal. There was even a late shot on target – and a goal for Rooney – from the penalty spot. It was the United captain's first shot on goal of the calendar year and he will be glad that one of the season's most peculiar statistics is no more. United definitely will have to be better than this when Arsene Wenger and his players turn up at Old Trafford next month but that won't worry Van Gaal now. The night's crucial goals – the first two - also came from two players he didn't even particularly rate when he took the United job last summer. That won't worry him either. Somehow Van Gaal and his United team continue to carry their heads above water and, despite the manner of their football, there is something to be said for that. Certainly after 50 minutes here, they looked to be in real trouble. Neither team managed to create anything in the first half but Preston surged from the blocks at the start of the second period to put the frighteners on United. Centre forward Joe Garner had carried a physical threat throughout but it was his run from deep that found United stretched in the 47th minute and enabled Preston to score. As Garner moved forwards, Laird appeared at speed to his left and although the defender's cross shot looked as though it may be heading wide of the far post, Antonio Valencia stretched out a foot and deflected the ball beneath De Gea and in to the goal.

As Simon Grayson's players celebrated wildly, United's players took their positions for the restart looking a little stunned. It's hard to say why. These type of episodes have, after all, become rather too familiar over recent months. Briefly, Van Gaal was staring at his own Olympiacos moment. It was defeat in Greece almost a year ago that signalled the beginning of the end for Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes. There would have been no such threat to the current United manager had they lost here but this was a performance that was shaping up to be every bit as lame as that one in Athens. As it was, United did find something from somewhere. Van Gaal certainly helped, taking Falcao off and sending on Ashley Young. A change of shape released Fellaini further forwards and that, in the end, proved to be effective.

Wed 1 – Blackburn (A) 3-4 . Sat 4 – Fulham (H) 4-2 . Sat 11 – Portsmouth (A) 3-1 . Sat 18 – Liverpool (A) 0-1 . For a while, not much changed. Preston seemed buoyed by their goal and seemed intent on scoring a second. Sometimes, though, you need something to go your way and United got a small break on the way to their equaliser in the 65th minute. Preston seemed secure enough as Daley Blind and Young funnelled the ball through the middle but when Herrera sought to beat a Preston defender to the ball he had the determination and presence to force it in to the corner past goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckmann from ten yards. It was a peculiar goal but, for United, it was hugely important. Equally important, and impressive, was the manner in which they managed to find another gear from that point on. Preston didn't disappear from the game completely. Garner, for instance, brought a plunging save from De Gea with a decent header. United, though, managed to establish themselves as the genuinely dominant force and for the first time they brought a cutting edge too. Fellaini's influence was growing and United had the intelligence to play to that strength. The Belgian is becoming increasingly effective as a 'Plan B' and when his header from an Antonio Valencia cross was saved by Stuckmann in the 72nd minute he lashed the loose ball across goal and high in to the corner with a certain amount of glee. With that, the game seemed over and Preston's race run. They had enjoyed a sight of glory but good teams can ruin things like that pretty quickly and United, for all their issues, remain clinical when it matters. There was still time for Rooney to score, his penalty coming after Stuckmann dashed from goal to floor him rather recklessly. There were subsequent suggestions of a dive but that was something of a side issue. United's weird season rolls on. It may yet end at Wembley.

"Joni Edelman knows that 'thin equals happy' is a fantasy - and wants more people to understand it, too. The mother-of-five from California has written an incredibly personal essay about how her quest to retain her picture-perfect size 4 body was not only making her unhealthy but miserable. A full-time nurse, Edelman was 35-years-old with three kids and weighed just 123 pounds because of her obsession with counting calories and working out. It was a condition she came to refer to as 'exercise bulimia'. Before and after: Joni Edelman says she put herself through hell to maintain her size 4 figure. So she decided to stop, and said she has never been happier . Flashback: Edelman, seen here on vacation with her husband, made a decision to stop torturing herself with diets and exercise and enjoy herself . Happier: The mother-of-five has not revealed what she weighs now, but was 123 pounds at her smallest . 'If I ate a cookie I needed to run 3 miles,' she told The Chicago Tribune. 'I was thin. 'And when I looked in the mirror, I still saw flaws; ''My stomach is saggy because I've had kids. My breasts have lost their volume.'' 'There was no satisfaction in the thinness.' Edelman's essay first appeared on Ravishly. In it she explains how she kept her diet to a measly 1,000 calories a day. '(I maintained being a size 4) by running 35 miles a week, by sleeping an average of three hours a day, by counting every bit of food I ate, down to a single cherry tomato, by writing and tracking my weight every day for a year, by running the stairs of the hospital during my 12-hour shifts, by losing my period,' Edelman wrote. Obsessive: Edelman (left) says she was living off a measly 1,000 calories and running 35 miles each week to retain her stunning figure . Better off: The mother-of-five says there is a 'stillness, joy and peace' to her life now that she's never had . 'Exercise bulimia': Joni Edelman would even work out during shifts at the hospital, running up stairs . 'Being a size 4 made me a lot of things. 'It did not make me happy. It made me obsessed with my workouts, with how much time I could fit in at the gym between taking care of three small kids and working 12-hour overnight shifts.' Edelman goes on to say she felt compelled to write about her situation in order to make people aware of what she calls a dangerous stereotype. 'This isn't to say that thin people aren't happy (duh), but this is to say that being thin is not: A. A cure for sadness or B. A guarantee of happiness,' Edelman wrote. 'It is to say this: Happiness does not require thinness. Fatness does not presume sadness.' Edelman, who has bipolar disorder, said the effects of her new approach have been dramatic, particularly mentally. Family first: Edelman's change of perspective has given her more time with her  husband and five children . All-smiles: Edelman  felt compelled to write about her situation to call out a dangerous stereotyple that 'thin equals happy' 'There is a stillness, a joy, and a peace I've never had. 'It's worth 10 pounds. 'Ten pounds are insignificant when compared to my willingness to let some things go, to sit with my kids, to sleep. 'I'm happy. 'I'm fat and I'm happy.' Happy: Joni Edelman has written an insightful personal essay about how she is 'fat and happy'","Joni Edelman was 35 and had three children, but weighed only 123 pounds .

"Four years ago, Wayne Rooney scored one of the best goals of his career, an overhead kick against Manchester City. For some time afterwards, City captain Vincent Kompany admitted the image of Rooney mid-air was burned on to his retina. United won the Barclays Premier League that season. Rooney’s return of 16 club goals was modest for him but many of them were important. He scored against Liverpool, Chelsea (twice), Arsenal and in a Champions League semi-final and final against Schalke and Barcelona respectively. Now, Rooney – the captain of his club and his country – is having to adjust to drastically changed circumstances at Old Trafford and one wonders just how long England’s most celebrated modern centre forward will allow it to last. Wayne Rooney scores the memorable overhead kick against Manchester City on February 12, 2011 . The Manchester United captain stands in celebration of his wonder strike at Old Trafford . Rooney scored 16 goals during the 2010-11 season to help United win the Premier League title . 13 - The 29-year-old has just 13 shots on target in 21 league appearances this season. Last season he registered 43 shots on target in 29 appearances. 84.38 - His pass accuracy has increased this season playing in a deeper role. 4 - But only four of his 1,210 passes have set up team-mates for league goals. He has created 30 chances in 21 games, compared to 56 in 29 last season. The statistics of Rooney’s season are remarkable. He is in the middle of his worst scoring run since 2006 – having scored in just one of his last 11 United games – and has not managed to have a single shot on goal since the turn of the calendar year. That last statistic is so startling, Rooney himself was stunned to learn of it. But when he looks back at his latest 90 minutes, against Burnley on Wednesday, he will certainly begin to understand it. Rooney has not always played as a traditional number nine at United. Far from it. He has played left and right and he has played in the fashionable ten position. He has always been a selfless and versatile footballer. In Louis van Gaal’s team, however, Rooney has been asked to perform a conventional midfield role. On Wednesday – after an injury to Daley Blind – he spent an hour playing in front of his own back four. After an injury to Daley Blind, the United skipper was deployed in front of the back four against Burnley . Rooney's heat map against Burnley shows that he spent the majority of the game behind the halfway line . The 29-year-old joins Chris Smalling in celebration of the defender's second goal of the night . It was a staggering and unedifying sight as United’s most potent forward player scuffled about in the cheap seats simply because Van Gaal – by his own subsequent admission – had no one else in his squad he could trust to do it. In the second half he was booked. Those of us who have watched Rooney over the years recognised the pattern. As his frustration built, he began to niggle at opponents, snipe at the officials. He was eventually cautioned for persistent offending. Classic Rooney. As always, he did his utmost to drag his team through the game. Up ahead of him, though, the glamour pairing of Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao lumbered through the night like a couple on a rather uncomfortable first date. They were wooden and inhibited and Van Gaal eventually called time early by hauling Falcao from the field. Louis van Gaal has been asking Rooney to play in a conventional midfield role . United loanee Radamel Falcao (right) has struggled to make an impact when playing up front . The former Everton youngster gets stuck into a challenge during United's 2-0 victory in January . Publicly, Rooney has said nothing about his current role. He admires Van Gaal, is impressed by his CV and his thoroughness and clarity. Be under no illusion, though, this will be irritating the hell out him. Eventually we can expect the dam to burst and if that happens Van Gaal will have a problem to deal with. Still only 29, Rooney remains ambitious and, more importantly, he still sees himself as a centre forward. He is by all accounts proving to be a much better captain than some at Old Trafford expected, especially away from the field. Publicly, Rooney has said nothing about his current role and admires United boss Van Gaal . Rooney is in the middle of his worst scoring run since 2006 – having scored in just one of his last 11 games . Nevertheless, Rooney still has a desperate hunger for goals and glory, both collective and individual. The longer he remains stuck 25 goals behind Sir Bobby Charlton’s club record of 249 and the longer United remain muddled and detached from genuine league title contention, the greater the risk of disenfranchising the player Van Gaal’s team really should be built around. The days of English clubs playing two centre forwards – the Toshack/Keegan days - are all but gone. In some ways, coaches have become too sophisticated for their own good. Rooney understands this but is also self-aware enough to always have one eye on his own future. After all, when he signed his big new contract in February 2014, he did not do so thinking that only a year later he would be spending his time doing a less than convincing impression of Michael Carrick.

"An epileptic driver who killed a passenger in his car after he had a seizure while driving no longer has charges imposed against him. In 2012 Vincent Zanfardino was charged with second-degree murder, criminally negligent homicide, and assault. On Tuesday, Zanfardino was found not guilty by the Bronx Supreme Court  even though he was advised by his doctor not to drive. Not guilty: Vincent Zanfordino , pictured here at the The Bronx Criminal Court on November 13th, was found not guilty for murder on Tuesday  for driving and crashing a car when he had an epileptic seizure . Gothamist reports that Zanfardino's lawyer argued that being epileptic was not Zanfardino's fault and that New York State law allows people with epilepsy to drive. Despite being on is medication, Zanfardino had an epileptic seizure while driving on the New England Thruway in the Bronx on July 11 of 2012. Inside the car was Alfred Reitano, 25, who suffered a head injury and died the next day. Also in the car were Brynn Rohlf and her fiancé, Dylan Gardineer. The New York Times  reports that in the state of New York people typically need to be seizure free for 12 months. Mr. Zanfardino suffered from epilepsy since his 20s and took anti-seizure medication, but had still experienced an increasing number of seizures in the last few years. He had been advised by his doctor on numerous occasions not to drive. 'My world as I know it is over,' Ms. Reitano said as she waited outside the courtroom earlier this month. 'Freddy was my firstborn son and he was the light of my life. Life will never be the same without him.' 'I don’t think he should have been driving if he knew the consequences,' she said of Zanfardino. The New York Times reports that had Zanfardino been convicted he would have faced a penalty of between 5 to 25 years behind bars.

"This is the moment an Indian cattleman grabs a wild lion by the tail and pokes it with a stick - while his friend filmed it. The pair had been driving their cattle through the Jasadhar forest range area of India's Gir wildlife sanctuary - the only home of rare Asiatic lions and a key conservation area in Asia. Kanu Vala, 29, and 31-year-old Shiva Lakhantra found the lioness lying on the ground and unable to walk. Scroll down for video . An Indian cattleman came held this Asiatic lion by the tail while his friend filmed him after the pair had come across the wounded animal in the wild . Kanu Vala poked the animal with a stick to prove to conservationists that it was still alive and in need of help . When they realised that she was wounded, and seemed unable to move, they raised the alarm with forestry officials. Vala said: 'I told him exactly where it was, but about five hours later I got a call saying they couldn't find it and it must have moved on. 'But because we were near the area we had a look on the way back, and saw that the lion was still there in exactly the same spot. 'It was clearly not well, and so we shot a video of me holding the lion's tail and poking it with my stick to show them that it was clearly alive and in need of help. 'We then sent them the video, to prove we were telling the truth.' When the men realised the lion was wounded, and seemed unable to move, they raised the alarm with forestry officials . Officials have confirmed that the animal, which could not walk properly, was recovered as a result of a report by the two men and is now being treated . The man in charge of conservation in the area, Rayal Meena, said: 'As a result of being informed about the injured animal, we recovered it and took it to the Jasadhar Animal Care centre late in the evening.' The video, which was initially misunderstood as showing the men taunting the animal by local media, quickly went viral. But officials have confirmed that the animal, which could not walk properly, was recovered as a result of a report by the two men and is now being treated.

"A woman who drowned her two daughters while in the middle of a bitter custody battle with her ex-husband is trying to get her murder conviction overturned. Elaine Campione of Toronto, Canada, told her daughters to 'blow bubbles in the bathtub' and then held their heads underwater until they died. Now, she is trying to convince a judge she is not criminally responsible for the 2006 murders due to a mental disorder. Monster: Elaine Campione (left) told her daughters to 'blow bubbles in the bathtub' and then held their heads underwater until they died to get revenge on her ex-husband Leo (right) Gone to soon: After she drowned her daughters, Serena, 3, and Sophia, 19 months, Elaine put them in princess dresses and curled their hair . According to the Toronto Sun, it was determined by both sides during Campione's trial that she was mentally ill, but she was also aware that what she was doing was mentally wrong. The mother even filmed as she drowned the girls and then put them in white dresses and curled their hair, then put their hands together and laid them both on her bed. At this point she looked at the video camera and said to her husband, 'Here, are you happy now?' She then added, 'The children are gone. How does that make you feel?' She would then wait an entire 33 hours before notifying authorities, telling them that she killed Serena, 3, and Sophia, 19 months, because 'my babies don’t belong to him, they belong to me.' Horror: Elaine videotaped the killing and aftermath, waiting 33 hours to call police . Second chance: Now Elaine wants her murder convictions overturned as she claims she was not aware that what she was doing was morally wrong . Now, her legal team is trying to argue that she truly believed she was saving her two daughters from her ex-husband, Leo, by murdering them. 'She believed they were unsafe on earth and that by sending them to heaven, she was providing them with a safe haven where they could have a happy life together,' said he appeal lawyers Joseph Di Luca and Erin Dann. A jury in 2010 believed that Campione knew what she was doing was wrong, and convicted her of two counts of first-degree murder. Even she seemed completely aware, describing herself as a 'monster' to police officers after committing the murders. Should she win on appeal, who could be released and simply serve a short period committed to a psychiatric hospital.","Elaine Campione of Toronto, Canada, told her daughters to 'blow bubbles in the bathtub' and then held their heads underwater until they died in 2006 .

"A heroic 12 year old girl has saved the lives of other motorists and her own, after she was forced to take the wheel of her father's car, and steer it clear from ongoing traffic, after he blacked out. The 51 year old Kotara man, who died after it's believed he went into cardiac arrest, crashed his Mazda MX5 into a tree on Canley avenue at Kotara, in Newcastle at around 8:40pm Wednesday night. An off-duty police officer, who saw the accident unfold, went to the aid of the girl, before rendering the vehicle safe and commencing CPR on the man. He was taken to John Hunter hospital but could not be revived and died.

Police say she was able to steer it away from ongoing traffic, in a 70 kilometre an hour zone, before it mounted a kerb and eventually stopped, striking a tree. Newcastle police Inspector Gerard Lawson says the young girl was heroic in her actions and avoided another crash and potential fatalities. 'Not every 12 year old could do that, with something happening to her father and still be able to control the vehicle,' he said. The incident happened in Kotara, in Newcastle (pictured) Police say a 12 year old girl was heroic to avoid oncoming traffic after she took the wheel from her father who suffered possible cardiac arrest . 'She has had no formal training and she was able to manipulate the car to avoid other vehicles.' 'Had there been another impact, it scares me to think what could have happened. She saved her life and other motorists.' Inspector Lawson said it was remarkable that the young girl was able to avoid other vehicles on the road because she couldn't use the brake or the accelerator. He confirmed the girl did not have any physical injuries but admitted the incident took its toll. 'She was distressed (after the accident) and her mum came to the scene and they went to the hospital.'

"Toyota Motor Corp has recalled a further 57,000 cars to replace potentially deadly air bags. They are among 16 million vehicles recalled worldwide since 2008 over the faulty inflators made by Takata Corp. And the number will almost certainly rocket up as US safety regulators have urged Takata to issue a nationwide recall of driver-side air bags, rather than targeting humid areas where the inflators are thought to be more dangerous. It comes after Honda Motor Co issued a similar recall two weeks ago following a fifth death related to Takata's inflator. Mass recall: More than 50,000 Toyota cars have been recalled after a fifth death caused by an air bag . The fault is caused by a water leak in the air conditioning unit which could cause water to seep into other parts of the car causing circuits to short and unexpected malfunctions to occur. Toyota said that the airbag control module is one area which could be affected with the safety device becoming 'disabled or could inadvertently deploy'. In a few cases the power steering function could be disabled, they said. In October 2013, more than 850,000 vehicles including Camrys, the Camry Hybrid, Avalon, Avalon Hybrid, and Venza which were made in 2012 and 2013 were recalled. The majority of the original recall involved cars in North America. On Thursday, Toyota revealed the Vitz, or Yaris, model made between 2002 and 2004 would be recalled in a number of markets. Fears: US safety regulators have urged the inflator manufacturer Takata to recall more American cars . About 40,000 are in Japan, 6,000 in Europe and the rest in other markets outside North America. Toyota said it was not aware of any injury or death related to the recall. Separately, Toyota's small-car subsidiary Daihatsu Motor Co also issued a recall, in Japan, of 27,571 Mira minivehicles produced between December 2002 and May 2003 for the same reason - its first recall involving Takata inflators. About 2.6 million vehicles have been recalled in Japan so far for Takata's air bag inflators, a transport ministry official said. Takata has so far resisted expanding the recall, saying that could divert replacement parts away from the high-humidity regions that need them most.","57,000 cars recalled worldwide on Thursday following death in Malaysia .

Firefighters received an emergency call and three crews were dispatched to the Santiago hotel . Officials are still trying to determine what went wrong and will investigate whether the platform had been secured properly. A similar incident occurred in New York earlier this month when two window washers were left dangling outside the 69th floor of One World Trade Center when their scaffold broke. The two men were trapped for 90 minutes before members of the Fire Department of New York managed to rescue them by breaking through a panel of glass on the 68th floor and pull them in to safety. Both washers escaped the terrifying ordeal unharmed, but they were taken to a nearby medical clinic as a standard procedure .

"Australian women are increasingly choosing to save money by buying affordable cosmetics at supermarkets rather than paying a premium for designer brands from department and specialty stores. And Daily Mail Australian can reveal Australia's two top-selling brands are Maybelline and Covergirl, which aren't offered at department stores such as Myer and David Jones, and can cost almost five times less than prestigious brands. ,For example, mascaras made by top cosmetic line such as Chanel, M.A.C, Benefit and Napoleon Perdis cost at least $35 each, while mascaras for Covergirl and Maybelline sell in supermarkets from as low as $7.62. Scroll down for video . Maybelline, which is sold at supermarkets such as Coles and Woolworths, are one of the top selling cosmetic brands in Australia. Pictured is Aussie model Ruby Rose . Covergirl is also a popular brand among Australian women, which is offered at Woolworths and Coles. Singer Katy Perry, who is touring Australia, is the face of the brand . Recent figures from Roy Morgan Research found that now more than one in four women over the age of 14 are choosing to buy their cosmetics from supermarkets such as Woolworths or Coles. The increase in the number of women shopping for cosmetics in the supermarket over the  last four years comes as sales in traditional stores for makeup, such as chemists, department and specialty stores, has fallen or remained stagnant. It seems supermarkets are becoming not only the place to save money on groceries, but make up. General manager of Roy Morgan Research, Geoffrey Smith, says stores such as Woolworths and Coles stock a wide range of popular cosmetic brands including Covergirl and Rimmel. Coles also offers Aussie brand Nude by Nature while Woolworths stocks ModelCo. Australia's top selling make up brand Maybelline is stocked at both stores, with mascaras such as the Colossal Mascara Black at 9ml which retails for about $21.49 at Woolworth and $21.67 at Coles. Priceline also offered the same product for a lower price at about $19.95, despite research showing the number of women buying their cosmetics at the store also decreased by nearly two per cent. Maybelline is one of Australia's top brands, despite not being offered in department stores such as David Jones and Myer . A spokeswoman for Woolworths provided their top selling products, most of which were Maybelline costmetics. Coles were unable to provide the same information, as they believed it would be 'commercially sensitive'. However a Coles spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia: 'People are turning to supermarkets for cosmetics because of the range, convenience and price. You don't need to break the bank for your beauty needs with some of our top sellers being mascara, eye liner and pressed powder as they offer customers great quality and value.' Lower performing retailers, according to data released by Roy Morgan Research, are Australian department chains Myer and David Jones as staff at both stores told Daily Mail Australia they no longer stock Maybelline and Covergirl. But Myer Group general manager of cosmetics, Liz Webster, told Daily Mail Australia that customers come to their stores 'for a leading range of prestigious cosmetic brands'. One of Woolworth's best selling products is Maybelline's Colossal Mascara Black 9ml (left), which sell for $21.49, while Myer's top seller is Clinique's Dramatically Different Moisturising Lotion (right) which retails for $49 at 125ml . A Myer spokeswoman says their customers come to their stores for prestigious brands such as Chanel . Data from Roy Morgan Research reveals showed 25.6 per cent of women bought their make-up from a supermarket while one in every five - about 20.0 per cent - purchased theirs from a chemist . 'Our cosmetic consultants have incredible product knowledge and we also offer a range of additional services including makeup tutorials, application,' Ms Webster said. 'We also give customers the opportunity to sample and trial cosmetics and skin care to ensure the product is right for them.' Their leading cosmetic brands include Chanel, M.A.C, Benefit and Napoleon Perdis while their top selling product is the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturising Lotion which retails for $49 at 125ml. According to Roy Morgan Research, in the year to June 2014, 25.6 per cent of women bought their make-up from a supermarket which include Coles and Woolworths. The study found one in every five women - 20.0 per cent - bought their cosmetics from a chemist. Make-up shopping at discount stores such as Target, Big W and Kmart has decreased to 12 per cent as well as the number of women buying their cosmetics at Priceline stores - 13.6 per cent. The proportion of women who buy their make up at Myer is at 11.8 per cent David Jones, is just under the 5 per cent mark. Mascaras from these brands retail from about $35 while mascaras for Covergirl and Maybelline retail from about $7.62 at Woolworths and $16.50 at Coles. Mr Smith says the increasing shopping trend at supermarkets comes down to convenience and costs. 'Although it might at first glance seem odd, supermarkets have been the leading channel for purchasing cosmetics for more than a decade,' he said. 'For women with busy lifestyles and multiple commitments, buying their make up at the same place as their groceries cuts out the need for a separate visit to another shop and saves them precious time. 'Bearing in mind that value for money is the factor most women consider important when buying make-up, retailers that offer cosmetics at a reasonable price have the advantage in this crowded and competitive market.' The research - conducted over a six month period to June 2014 on 4,791,000 Australian women - further shows supermarkets have had the largest increase since 2010 compared to other retailers, jumping from 20.9 per cent to 25.9 per cent. It also reveals one in every five Australian women - about 20.0 per cent - purchased their make up from a chemist. Shopping at discount stores such as Target, Big W and Kmart declined from 14.1 per cent to 12.0 per cent. Recent figures from Roy Moran Research found one in four women above the age of 14 are choosing to buy their cosmetics at stores such as Coles . Australian women are also choosing to buy their make up at Woolworths as it saves time and money .","Australian women above the age of 14 are buying their cosmetics from Coles and Woolworths .

"Madam Speaker Bronwyn Bishop proved she was not to be messed with yesterday afternoon after she suspended a record-breaking 18 MPs from Question Time in Canberra. The penultimate sitting of the Parliament's Question Time seemed to bring out the raucous side of the MPs - all of whom represented the Labor Party - who were speaking out of turn and hurling comments down from the benches. All of the 18 MPs were given their marching orders in the space of one hour, as Ms Bishop cut them off one at a time, naming and shaming them in front of their peers. Madam Speaker Bronwyn Bishop proved she was not to be messed with yesterday afternoon after she suspended a record-breaking 18 MPs from Question Time . Furious Opposition MPs blasted the Labor members, claiming they were deliberately trying to evade Question Time for their own benefit. Madam Bishop noted that her list of suspended MPs could have ulterior motives including many MPs who had planes to catch and others who were eager to get back on the campaign trail. Most of the MPs ejected from Parliament were possibly looking to return to their electorates for a three-day break before Parliament resumes for its final sitting next week. Labor MP Graham Perrett leaves the chamber of the House of Representatives after being suspended by the Speaker during question time at Parliament House in Canberra . Cutting remarks from Opposition Leader Bill Shorten about Madam Bishop's actions did not go down well. Mr Shorten said he believed the Speaker had picked on the Labor Party, however Ms Bishop shot back and put him in his place and said she gave them their marching orders due to their unacceptable behaviour. 'Simply to stand there and try and say that you all behaved like little angels and were picked on is pathetic,' she said to Mr Shorten.

'The Australian public should know that the Labor Party have run a deliberate strategy of ejection today from the House. 'They have deliberately attempted to be thrown out,' he said. As the absurd session came to an end,  Tony Burke, manager of Opposition business, commented on the enormity of the suspensions. 'At risk of adding to the total, I should note that 18 people in one Question Time is an all-time record since Federation,' he said. Madam Bishop's Question Time lasted an unprecedented 70 minutes and she broke the previous record of 12 for the amount of suspensions in one Parliament sitting.

"Shoppers are being urged to boycott supermarket chicken after a report showed alarming numbers are contaminated with a potentially lethal bug. Seven out of ten fresh chickens are carrying campylobacter on the skin, according to new study from the Food Standards Agency (FSA). The bug is responsible for an estimated 280,000 cases of food poisoning each year and as many as 100 deaths. Scroll down for video . Asda came out worst in the study. However the food watchdog made it clear that all the supermarkets are putting customers at risk. Consumer groups have condemned the retailers, saying they should ‘hang their heads in shame’ for selling food they know is dangerous. But Tim Lang, the professor of food policy at City University London, went further and advised families to boycott chicken until the industry can guarantee the meat is safe. He compared the public health crisis to mad cow disease and salmonella, saying: ‘I would suggest that we refuse to buy poultry until this is sorted out. This is a public health scandal easily on a par to that of the 1980s-90s.’ The number of fresh shop-bought chickens contaminated with the lethal campylobacter food poisoning bug has risen to 70 per cent . Professor Lang went on to suggest that the public should withhold its money until confidence in the safety of chicken is restored. ‘This may not be part of the public health methods but it’s definitely what history shows works when things are dire,’ he said. The FSA found that 70 per cent of chickens on sale over the six months between February and the end of July were contaminated – worse than the 65 per cent reported in a similar study in 2009. During the May to July period, the figure was eight in ten birds, and could have been as much as nine in ten for some retailers. Almost one in five – 18 per cent – of the fresh roasting chickens were contaminated with the highest levels of the bug. More than one in 20, or 6 per cent, carried the bug on the outside of packs, meaning that people simply picking them from the shelf to check a price could fall ill. The study also revealed that Asda was the worst performer, with a contamination rate of 78 per cent. More than one in ten of its packs – 12 per cent – carried the potentially lethal bug on the outside. The second highest contamination rate was for a group of smaller retailers including independent butchers and budget chains like Lidl, Aldi, Iceland and Budgens with a contamination rate of 76 per cent. The Co-op came next followed by Morrisons, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose, Marks & Spencer and Tesco. Producers have struggled to identify how the bug is introduced to flocks. While it is found in the  countryside, most of the 800million chickens raised for food in the UK each year spend their entire lives inside . Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘These results are a damning indictment of supermarkets and consumers will be rightly shocked at the failure of trusted household brands to stem the tide of increasingly high levels of campylobacter. Supermarket bosses should hang their heads in shame.’ Earlier this year, retailers mounted a fierce lobbying campaign against the FSA survey. Specifically, they wanted to block the naming and shaming of stores because of the risk to sales and profits. Initially, they were successful after winning over ministers and officials in the Department of Health, DEFRA and even the Prime Minister’s office. Asda had the highest percentage of contaminated fresh chickens at 78 per cent . However the FSA decided to publicly shame the stores following pressure from consumer groups, academics and the public. Critics have argued that the FSA and the Government have failed to ensure supermarkets sell safe food – with the commercial interests of stores, processors and farmers given greater priority than consumers’ health. Significantly, the FSA has no powers to force supermarkets to take so-called ‘dirty chickens’ off their shelves or to impose any sort of sanction or fine to ensure they make improvements. It is hoping that the industry abides by a promise to reduce the number of the highly contaminated birds to 10 per cent by the end of 2015. The illness associated with the bug has enormous economic costs in terms of lost days at work and NHS treatment. Some estimates put this bill at £900million a year. An Asda spokesman said: ‘We take campylobacter seriously and it goes without saying that we’re disappointed with these findings.’ The British Retail Consortium, which represents the supermarkets, claimed the industry is doing its best to tackle the bug. Campylobacter is killed by thorough cooking and can be limited by careful hygiene but it is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK, affecting an estimated 280,000 people a year. Symptoms usually develop two to five days after eating contaminated food. Most people recover after a few days but in some cases, campylobacter infection can cause irritable bowel syndrome, reactive arthritis or miscarriage. It can be fatal in young children, the elderly and people with a weakened immune system, including cancer patients. Around 100 of the victims die from vomiting and stomach upsets. Poultry is the source of the majority of these cases. Research by the Institute of Food Research showed that the persistence of campylobacter - a group of bacteria that commonly cause food poisoning - is boosted by 'chicken juice'. Organic matter exuding from chicken carcasses provides the bacteria with the perfect environment to flourish in the food chain. The findings, the researchers said, highlight the importance of cleaning surfaces during food preparation. But Professor Brendan Wren, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: ‘Frankly it is scandalous that two out of three chickens bought into our households are contaminated with such a serious pathogen, I can’t think of any other situation where this would be allowed. Our poultry flocks need to be vaccinated against campylobacter, even if this slightly increases the cost of poultry products.’","Results show every major retailer failed to meet  targets to reduce bug .

"A 17-year-old girl who faces several serious charges after allegedly tying an elderly man up to a table and stealing his credit cards to go shopping, is blaming the date-gone-wrong on her twin sister. The defense attorney representing New York teen Shalaine Foster, says it was her twin sister Shaina who met victim Paul Aronson, and led the plan to bind the 85-year-old up and steal his credit cards to go on a shooting spree while he lay helpless for 20 hours. 'There’s always that story of the good twin and the bad twin, who goes right and who goes wrong,' defense lawyer Brian Kennedy said Wednesday, as both sisters pleaded not guilty to a handful of charges related to the October incident. 'My client Sh​alaine was always going right but it seems she got caught up in something that was not of her making.' Shalaine Foster (left) is accused of tying up 85-year-old Paul Aronson (right) and leaving the elderly man for 20 hours while she and her twin sister Shaina went on a shopping spree . When she was first arrested last month, Shaina took full responsibility for the incident in an interview with police. 'He asked me to do things that I wasn’t going to do,' Shaina said at the time. 'He’s ugly, old and disgusting. I tied him up. I took his money and left. He was starting to creep me out. I brought the zip ties in case of a situation where I needed them. Don’t get my sister in trouble. I brought her there.' Both sisters pleaded not guilty to charges of kidnapping, burglary, robbery, assault, and grand larceny on Wednesday and were remanded in jail. They face a minimum of 15 years in prison if convicted of kidnapping. It was Shaina who allegedly met Aronson, a retired lawyer, on the website SeekingArrangement.com, which pairs older, wealthier men, with young women looking for 'sugar daddies'. 17-year-old Shalaine pleaded not guilty to charges related to the incident on Wednesday, blaming her twin who met Aronson on  'sugar daddy' dating website SeekingArrangement.com and invited her along for the dinner date . When Aronson invited Shaina to dinner, she asked her sister to come along and after the meal the threesome went back to the older man's luxury townhouse on East 38th Street in Manhattan. Aronson then offered the underage sisters more alcohol before the night took a sour turn and he found himself on the floor, bound to his coffee table. 'Defendant Shaina Foster zip tied informant’s leg to a coffee table while defendant Shalaine Foster zip tied informant’s hands behind his back,' according to court files. 'The informant fell onto the floor and could not get up and laid on the ground for approximately 20 hours.' Meanwhile, the girls stole Aronson's credit cards and $470 in cash before going shopping for make-up, it was claimed. Aronson was eventually found by a friend who freed him and called police. The girls, who both have criminal records, were held without bail in a Manhattan Criminal Court after their arrest. Previously, they lived in two separate foster homes. The New York Daily News spoke to the girls' brother outside the courtroom when they were first arraigned last month and he said: 'The story sounds f****ed up'. The sisters stole Aronson's credit cards and $470 in cash before leaving him tied to a coffee table at his luxury townhouse on Manhattan's East 38th Street. Aronson lay helplessly on the floor for 20 hours until he was discovered by a friend . 'But it’s also an 85-year-old wealthy man who basically has these young girls like they’re in a candy store,' he said. 'We know he bought them liquor and intoxicated them and took him back to the house.' Reporters also spoke the twins' mother who is denying all accusations against her daughters. 'These are 17-year-old girls ... college-bound, upstanding citizens,' said their overwhelmed mother. 'They’re not sleazy girls at all, whatsoever. It’s going to ruin their lives forever.' 'I don’t know what to say other than this is horrible,' she said. Shaina has one felony arrest for possession of a sealed instrument (alcoholic beverage) plus one sealed arrest. Shalaine was arrested last April for introduction of prison contraband in addition to two sealed arrests. While the age of consent in 17 in New York, the website Seekingarrangement.com states that all members must be over the age of 18. The site defines a sugar daddy as, 'Successful men and women who know what they want. They’re driven, and enjoy attractive company by their side. Money isn’t an issue, thus they are generous when it comes to supporting a Sugar Baby.' A sugar baby is described as, ‘Attractive people looking for the finer things in life. They appreciate exotic trips and gifts. Sugar Babies get to experience a luxurious lifestyle, and meet wealthy people on a regular basis.’ Last month, MailOnline contacted Seeking Arrangement to inquire about how they regulate the safety of their members and ensure they are of legal age. In an emailed statement Seeking Arrangement speedily replied, 'We require individuals to be 18 years or older in order to use our site. We rely on self-reporting which is the same age verification process all other dating websites and social media platforms use. 'Unfortunately, there are some people who lie about their age. If we have any reason to suspect that a member is underage, we take immediate action and ask for proof of identity before that member will be allowed to continue using our site. If they cannot provide proof then they are suspended and removed from the site.' In regard to background checks and ensuring the safety of their members they said: 'SeekingArrangement.com goes to great lengths to protect the integrity of our site, and our members. Not only do we vet every member before a profile is approved, we also are one of the only online dating sites that offer background verification. While this is not a requirement, we encourage all members to only date those who have been background verified.' That being said, members on any dating site or online should proceed with caution before meeting in person.","Shalaine Foster, 17, says her twin sister Shaina met victim Paul Aronson on the sugar daddy dating website Seeking Arrangement .

"Distraught bowler Sean Abbott - who delivered the ball that felled Phillip Hughes - was seen leaving St Vincent's Hospital in tears after the death of the batsman. The 21-year-old, who plays for New South Wales, was bowling when Hughes collapsed at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday and was the first player to rush to his side. Abbott tenderly embraced Hughes as medical officers rushed onto the field and an ambulance was called. In the days after the tragic accident, Abbott has reportedly been having a tough time coping and has received counselling and support from players since Tuesday's incident. Scroll down for video . Sean Abbott leaves hospital surrounded by friends on Thursday, consoled by former Test opener Simon Katich (left) and a friend (right) Abbott delivered the ball that felled Hughes on Tuesday afternoon . Abbott was warmly embraced by teammates and cricketers at St Vincent's hospital on Thursday afternoon . Abbott, 22, was comforted at the hospital by players including Nathan Lyon . On Wednesday, Abbott returned to the SCG for a team counselling session and was supported by teammates and team officials who have been concerned. At the hospital on Thursday, he was met warmly by his own teammates, friends of Hughes and cricketing greats such as Steve Waugh. Looking pale and exhausted, Abbott arrived at St Vincent's wearing a navy baseball hat at 2.30pm. He excited the hospital after learning of Hughes' death wiping away tears with his head bowed and face hidden underneath his cap. In the hospital's coffee shop, where some of the cricketers had congregated, Abbott was given some words of advice from Waugh, while spin bowler Nathan Lyons draped a comforting arm around his shoulders. He then sat down and had a coffee with his teammates who were obviously rallying behind the young fast bowler. Sean Abbott was seen walking into Sydney Cricket Ground, where the horrific incident happened . The young cricketer was seen on Wednesday wearing a pair of sunglasses and was flanked by teammates . All NSW and South Australian players are receiving counselling and psychological support in the wake of the delivery. The Australian Cricketers' Association said it was monitoring Abbott, who delivered the ball, closely. It was reported Abbott was struggling as a host of former Australian pace greats jumped to his support.

'It says a lot about Sean doesn't it?' Sutherland said. 'Sean will have all the support he needs around him. 'I'm sure his teammates and everyone doesn't feel in any way ill of him for what happened. It's a freak, freak incident.' Former Australian bowler Stuart Clark told Fox Sports he understood Abbott was 'struggling a bit' and said the incident was not his fault. 'He's out there to get Phil Hughes out. It's a competitive sport. It's professional sport and I really feel for Sean Abbott at the moment,' he said. 'I hope he's got support... You just worry that this could jeopardise Sean Abbott and his cricket career and we don't want that.' There is a long history between Abbott and Hughes who came up through the junior ranks of the NSW cricketing system and are close friends. Former Test bowler Brett Lee said Abbott did not deserve any of the blame for the incident. 'You know you're always on edge bowling fast or being out there batting,' Lee told Channel 9. 'When you see something as shocking as this you really feel for Phil. 'I know first-hand that no one goes out there to try and maim a batsman, no one tries to hurt a batsman.' Lee's sentiments were echoed on social media by other sportsmen. Cricket legend Glenn McGrath tweeted a message of support out to Sean Abbott. 'Our thoughts are also with Sean Abbott,' he tweeted immediately after his message to Hughes.","Sean Abbott was one of the first players to help Phillip Hughes .

"Elvis Presley’s premature death may not have been caused by his lifestyle alone, but brought on by an undiagnosed genetic condition, a new documentary claims. After tracking down a sample of Elvis’ hair and analysing its DNA, scientists found evidence that the singer was genetically prone to migranes, obesity and heart disease. The Channel 4 documentary series, which also investigates relics said to hail from famous and infamous names such as Marilyn Monroe, Charles III and Adolf Hitler, sheds new light on the death of the King. New evidence: An analysis of the a sample of what is claimed to be Elvis' hair, scientists have found that he was genetically prone to heart muscle disease as well as obesity, glaucoma and migranes . In his later years, Elvis Presley became addicted to junk-food and prescription drugs, which resulted in the former sex symbol becoming hugely overweight, and he died of cardiac arrhythmia at his home Graceland, in Memphis on August 16, 1977, aged 42. He was also known to have suffered from headaches and bad eyesight, however all of these things may have been in his genes. In the first episode of Dead Famous DNA, presenter Mark Evans tracks down a sample of Elvis’ hair from a friend of his barber. Tom B Morgan Jnr claims barber Homer Gilleland captured hair falling from Elvis’ head in a towel placed on his shoulders during his regular trims, and has since stored the hair in a bank vault. After analysing Elvis’s DNA, scientists found a gene mutation known to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy – a heart muscle disease that usually occurs in men between the ages of 20 and 40, causing which causes the thickening of the heart and weakening of the heart muscle. Death of a King: Elvis Presley, pictured in 1977, performing in one of his last concerts, was addicted to junkfood and prescription drugs in the latter years of his life and died of a heart attack in his home Graceland . Professor Stefan Shuester who extracted Elvis’ DNA from the hair said it was the best genome he has done. ‘This genome of a dead person who has died a long time ago is the best genome we have ever done,’ the Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pennyslvania State University said. ‘In fact we can actually decipher nearly 90 per cent of his genome… This is the blueprint of genetic information of what makes a person.’ After extracting the genome, the DNA sample was sent to medical geneticists in Kansas who found several mutations in Elvis’ DNA. Mutations, known as ‘variants’ can both benefit and harm, and in Elvis’ case the combination of his ‘variants’ may have been fatal. ‘Elvis and his doctor have both been blamed over the years for his premature death, and it was thought his overeating or overdosing on drugs had killed him’, presenter Mark Evans says. ‘Whilst those addictions would not have helped, this new evidence suggests Elvis may have had a flaw in his DNA and his early death was his genetic destiny.’ Heartbreak Hotel: Elvis, pictured in his prime in 1958, carried a gene mutation known to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a heart muscle disease, which may have remained undiagnosed . The analysis, carried out by Dr Stephen Kingsmore, Director of the Centre for Paediatric Genomic Medicine at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City found four major chromosome mutations. As well as mutations known to cause migranes and glaucoma, two issues which were known to have blighted the junkfood-addicted Elvis’ life in his later years, they also found evidence that he was genetically prone to obesity. Presley, a junk food addict who relied heavily on prescription drugs, was known to have suffered from headaches, bad eyesight and ballooned in weight towards the end of his life. Most importantly however was a mutation on Chromosome 11 which is known to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Elvis displayed many of the symptoms of this disease towards the end of his life including – irregular heartbeat, fatigue, fainting, high blood pressure. Dr Kingsmore said: ‘We know that Elvis had a strong family history of heart failure, and we know that he died suddenly, and at autopsy his heart was indeed thickened, which is another word for cardiomyopathy of a particular type. So this was a very good fit with Elvis’ clinical picture. ‘There had been so much speculation about cause of death, and so much ill spoken of his lifestyle, and we had this intriguing finding that possibly Elvis actually had a medical illness, and all of the stuff about how he killed himself with his lifestyle might have been very unfair. ‘ .","Elvis Presley died of a heart attack in August 1977, aged 42 .

"A couple who swindled £1million from the NHS to fund their luxury lifestyle of globetrotting and flashy cars have been jailed for a total of five-and-a-half years. John Leigh, 54, and Deborah Hancox, 45, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, were involved in a seven-year conspiracy supplying equipment and services to the NHS at inflated prices. It is thought the value of the fraud was more than £1million, with the couple pocketing about £300,000 which they used to buy holiday homes in Cyprus, Dubai and the Lake District. John Leigh, 54, (left) and Deborah Hancox, 45, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, were involved in a seven-year conspiracy supplying equipment and services to the NHS at inflated prices . They also bought a brand new Jaguar convertible and a Mercedes from the profits of the scam. At Manchester Crown Court today the pair were jailed after pleading guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to conceal criminal property at an earlier hearing. Leigh was sentenced to 44 months and Hancox was given 24 months in prison. They sparked a five-year manhunt after being interviewed by police about the fraud in 2008, before fleeing to the Turkish part of Cyprus. It was only when they moved to the south part of the island, the Republic of Cyprus, that the couple were brought back to England last year to face justice. The couple also bought a brand new Jaguar convertible and a Mercedes from the profits of the scam . Leigh worked for the NHS in purchasing and was responsible for buying mostly computers and other office equipment for various NHS departments. His partner Hancox also worked for the NHS. For more than seven years, Leigh used a company called Action Direct Technology Ltd - of which his partner Hancox was the owner, sole shareholder and company director - to buy overpriced goods and defraud his employer the NHS. The pair also used Bibi's IT Solutions Ltd and Wiscom Technology Ltd as a front to disguise their ongoing fraud between January 2001 and October 2008. Sgt Laura Walters, of GMP, said: 'This couple were involved in an well-orchestrated and meticulously planned conspiracy to defraud the NHS out of hundreds of thousands of pounds. 'This was not a get-rich-quick scheme - this was a sustained criminal enterprise stretching over seven years. Seven years is a long time to see the error of your ways but these individuals showed no remorse for their actions. 'In fact, we believe the very reason they switched companies later on was to cover up what they had done should there ever be an investigation. We also seized hundreds of email exchanges which showed they went to great lengths to cover their tracks by cooking the books to give them an air of authenticity. 'It is also clear they used the proceeds of their criminal activity to live a lavish lifestyle - the couple had a holiday home in the Lake District and they also invested in property in the United Arab Emirates and Cyprus. 'I also want to stress this is by no means a victimless crime. It is the NHS they scammed out of thousands of pounds - money which the NHS badly needs for the treatment of people with genuine illness. Every penny they plundered is money that was diverted away from someone in desperate need of medical treatment. 'I am delighted this case has finally been concluded and these con artists have been exposed and brought to justice.' Sue Frith, managing director of NHS Protect, said: 'This was a serious fraud against the NHS, cynically carried out by two individuals abusing their positions of trust and authority. 'Their determined attempts to evade justice compound the crimes. All suspicions of fraud reported to NHS Protect will be followed up, and investigated wherever appropriate. 'We press for prosecution of offenders and seek the strongest possible sanctions, so public money is not diverted from patient care.'","John Leigh and Deborah Hancox jailed for a total of five-and-a-half years .

"Militants in Iraq have seized nuclear materials used for scientific research at a university, the United Nations has been warned. Iraq warned of the seizure in a letter on Wednesday to the U.N. in which it appealed for help to 'stave off the threat of their use by terrorists in Iraq or abroad.' In the letter, which has been obtained by Reuters, Iraq's U.N. ambassador Mohamed Ali Alhakim said nearly 40kg of uranium compounds were kept at Mosul University. The city of Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, was captured last month in a seizure led by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). Militants in Iraq have seized nuclear materials used for scientific research at a university in Mosul. Pictured is an Isis supporter waving a flag in Raqqa, Syria, last month . The U.N. atomic agency has today said it believed the nuclear material was 'low grade' and did not pose a significant security risk. 'Terrorist groups have seized control of nuclear material at the sites that came out of the control of the state,' Alhakim told U.N Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, adding that such materials 'can be used in manufacturing weapons of mass destruction.' 'These nuclear materials, despite the limited amounts mentioned, can enable terrorist groups, with the availability of the required expertise, to use it separate or in combination with other materials in its terrorist acts,' said Alhakim. He warned that they could also be smuggled out of Iraq. The International Atomic Energy Agency . (IAEA) 'is aware of the notification from Iraq and is in contact to seek . further details', IAEA spokeswoman Gill Tudor said. Isis took over swathes of Syria and Iraq before renaming itself the Islamic State on June 29 and declaring its leader caliph - a title held by successors of the Prophet Mohammad. 'On the basis of the initial information we believe the material involved is low grade and would not present a significant safety, security or nuclear proliferation risk,' she said. 'Nevertheless, any loss of regulatory control over nuclear and other radioactive materials is a cause for concern.' A U.S. government source said the . materials were not believed to be enriched uranium and therefore would . be difficult to use to manufacture into a nuclear weapon. Earlier this week, video footage was published of ISIS militants taking sledgehammers to centuries-old graves in Mosul. Olli . Heinonen, a former IAEA chief inspector, said that if the material came . from a university it could be laboratory chemicals or radiation . shielding, consisting of natural or depleted uranium. 'You cannot make a nuclear explosive from this amount, but all uranium compounds are poisonous,' Heinonen told Reuters. 'This material is also not ""good"" enough for a dirty bomb.' In a so-called 'dirty bomb', conventional explosives are used to disperse radiation from any radioactive source, such as from hospitals and factories which are less well protected. 'These nuclear materials, despite the . limited amounts mentioned, can enable terrorist groups, with the . availability of the required expertise, to use it separate or in . combination with other materials in its terrorist acts' - Iraq's U.N. ambassador Mohamed Ali Alhakim . Citing U.N. investigations dating back . ten years or more, Heinonen said there should be no enriched uranium in . Mosul. The Vienna-based IAEA helped dismantle Iraq's clandestine nuclear . programme in the 1990s - during Heinonen's three decades there. Any loss or theft of highly enriched uranium, plutonium or other types of radioactive material is potentially serious as militants could try to use them to make a crude nuclear device or a 'dirty bomb', experts say. Because radioactive material is less hard to find and the device easier to make, experts say a 'dirty bomb' - which could cause panic and have serious economic and environmental consequences - is a more likely threat than an actual atom bomb. Earlier this week, video footage was published of ISIS militants taking sledgehammers to centuries-old graves in Mosul. Meanwhile, Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called on the Islamic State to release 49 people seized from the Turkish consulate in Mosul, before the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Erdogan appealed to the group during a Ramadan fast-breaking dinner late on Wednesday. Ramadan ends on July 27 in Turkey. The state-run Anadolu Agency quoted Erdogan as saying: 'If they are true believers they need to release our brothers. That's what we expect.' The Turks were seized from the consulate on June 11, when the group overran Mosul. They include diplomats, children and special forces police. Thirty-two Turkish truck drivers also seized in Mosul were released last week.","Iraq warned U.N. of seizure in letter which appealed for help to 'stave off the threat of their use by terrorists in Iraq or abroad'

"Neighbours have described the moment they heard a 75-year-old great grandmother gunned down through her own door screen. The body of Helen Dawson Key was found just inside her home at Toongabbie, in western Sydney, about 10am last Thursday (November 20). Authorities have confirmed that Mrs Dawson Key was shot in the head; the bullet having passed through the front screen door before striking her. Police are baffled by the killing. Ms Dawson Key's next-door neighbour of 14 years, Zhu Kayw, says she called the police after hearing the shot. 'We just heard the shot, bang that's it, just one that's all,' she said. Scroll down for video . Great Grandmother Helen Dawson Key, 75, was shot in the head at the front door of her home in Sydney's western suburbs. Police are baffled by her killing a week after it happened and want public help in tracking down the killer . 'There was no trouble before that - very quiet, even the dog was not barking,' he said. 'She lived alone, her partner passed away a few years ago. 'We would just meet and say hello when we collect the rubbish bins and bills - we would say ""hello, how are you? She was very friendly, yes.' Homicide Squad Commander, Detective Superintendent Michael Willing, said police were still trying to determine why Mrs Dawson Key was targeted. 'Mrs Dawson Key had no known links with crime, no known enemies, and by all accounts was a well-liked and highly-regarded member of the local community,' Det Supt Willing said. 'She had lived at this address for more than 30 years and had strong links with her neighbours and a local bowling club. 'We are, frankly, at a loss as to why someone would want to target her.' Ms Dawson Key, a member of the Toongabbie Sports and Bowling Club, formed 'many strong friendships within the club', according to a statement. 'Helen Dawson was a valued and respected part of the Toongabbie community having been involved with the clubs Lady Bowlers for some 20years. She was a committed member volunteering her time to co-ordinate the ladies activities and formed many strong friendships within the club,' the statement read. 'The club confirms that Helen was found by a concerned friend and club member who noted her absence at a recent event, which is reflective of the friendships Helen had formed at the club, and the tight knit friendships within the community. 'The club's community is shocked and dismayed at the circumstances surrounding Helen’s death and cannot understand how a respected senior citizen and friend could come to harm in her own home.' Det Supt Willing said Strike Force Elermore had been established to investigate Mrs Dawson Key’s death and needed the community’s help. 'We believe Mrs Dawson Key was shot just prior to 6pm the previous day (Wednesday 19 November),' Det Supt Willing added. 'Mrs Dawson Key’s front door was open, but her screen door was shut, so we think she might have answered a knock at the door. 'What we’re asking is for anyone who was in the area around the time of Mrs Dawson Key’s death, or has information about her movements that day, to come forward.'","Helen Dawson Key was well-liked and had no links to crime or enemies .

"This is the moment a tiny French bulldog  raises its paw in a fascist salute when its owner says 'Hail Spain!' and then plays dead when it hears the name of a left-wing politician. The 13-second video uploaded on YouTube shows a French bulldog, named Benito, raising one of his paws when his owner says 'Arriba España' (Hail Spain!) - a slogan which was used among supporters of fascist General Francisco Franco's Nationalist side in Spain's  Civil War. The clip then shows the tiny dog rolling over and playing dead when his owner mentions Pablo Iglesias, the leader of Spain's up-and-coming left-wing Podemos party. French bulldog Benito has been trained to raise his paw in a fascist salute when its owner says 'Hail Spain!' Benito has now become something of an online celebrity with the video garnering more than 51,000 hits since it was uploaded yesterday. While some  saw the funny side, others were not so impressed, with one YouTube member writing 'An intelligent dog for a fool master'. Mr Iglesias has apparently not taken offence and has since expressed his amusement at Benito's antics, tweeting that he laughed aloud when he saw the video. 'They've named him after Mussolini and his owner must be a right fascist, but this dog is great,' said a tweet on the left-wing leader's account, which is followed by 688,000 people. 'I laughed a lot.' In the video, the dog lifts one of its front legs in a fascist salute and then when he hears 'the pony-tailed one is coming' - a reference to Iglesias's long hair - Benito rolls over and plays dead. While the Podemos leader has taken the Benito video with a dose of good humour, the rapid rise of the party has coincided with a number of threatening comments posted about the party.

Benito has been taught to play dead when his owner mentions Pablo Iglesias, the leader of a left-wing party . Benito sports a Spanish flag necktie throughout the performance.

"An eight-year-old Palestinian girl is opposing the Israeli occupation of her West Bank village - with a mobile telephone. Jana Tamimi makes news reports about the regular conflicts with Israeli soldiers in Nabi Saleh, filming video on a camera phone and posting it online. She films her reports about her village at a time when demonstrations against Israeli settlements are taking place on a weekly basis after Friday prayers. Eight year old Palestinian girl, Jana Tamimi, is possibly the world's youngest citizen journalist . Tamimi said she wants to deliver the voice of her people to the world so they can gain more international support. 'When we started to go out for marches there weren't a lot of photographers with us so I had an idea to document and deliver our message. 'The message of all Palestinians and Palestinian children to the world so they come to support us and to free Palestine and live under freedom and get our rights.' Jana has been recording footage and uploading weekly news reports online - all from her smartphone . Her village of Nabi Saleh has long experienced Israeli occupation and have weekly demonstrations to protest . Residents of Nabi Saleh, which has a population of around 600, say 60 per cent of the village's territory has been seized by settlers, including a local spring, which they demand access to. Protests are held weekly by local Palestinians and international peace activists to express their disapproval about land lost to Israel settlements and have been for the past five years. 'The occupation is depriving us even from the most important right, which is the right to live, the right of swimming in the sea,' Tamimi added. 'When we go to school we always get delayed at barriers, which make us late for lessons at school. 'We want to live in freedom so when we walk in the street no settler will run us over. We want to feel that our land is secure and that we can walk in the street or on the hills anywhere without having Zionists shooting us or settlers running us over.' Jana hopes that by filming the soldiers and her village, she can bring the voice of her people to the world . Jana's Mother, Nawal Tamimi, told Reuters TV that her daughter's activism is a result of growing up surrounded by conflict. 'The demonstrations started in Nabi Saleh when she was three-years-old. 'Because our home is at the entrance of the village we are in the centre of the events where the clashes take place and where the firing of tear gas and other grenades take place as well, so she grew up with fear and pain.' 'The occupation is depriving us even from the most important right, which is the right to live,' Jana says . About 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem among 2.4 million Palestinians. The World Court has deemed Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem illegal.

"Speculators are offering 'no-win, no-fee' deals as they try to exploit a planning loophole to win permission to build houses on open fields. In a damning indictment of the Government's relaxed planning laws, one successful land agent is now so confident it can bulldoze past local objections that it does not charge farmers an upfront fee for its services. A Daily Mail investigation has revealed that Gladman Developments, a 'strategic land promoter', offers them the chance to increase the value of their land by a multiple of 50 or 60 by transforming agricultural land into development sites. Scroll down for video . Gladman Developments is seeking planning permission for this 15-acre farm near the Peak District . Gladman – one of the most successful of these 'predatory developers' – is pursuing 102 planning applications for huge housing developments all over England, most of them on greenfield land on the edge of rural towns and villages. The revelation comes days after two of the most respected rural institutions – the National Trust and Country Life magazine – issued warnings that some of Britain's most picturesque countryside is being desecrated as a result of the Government's reforms. They said rural communities are alarmed at the ease with which businesses are able to win planning permission for housing in the face of local opposition. Country Life said in an article last week that villages have been 'stripped of their natural defences' by the Government's reforms, which have opened the floodgates to greenfield planning applications. Its editor-at-large, Clive Aslet, wrote that while farmland was once protected, the balance had changed with the introduction of the new guidelines. Councils must now show they have enough land to meet housing targets for the next five years – or lose key powers to ward off planning applications. Sir Simon Jenkins, the outgoing chairman of the National Trust, said rolling farmland is being replaced by warehouses and bleak housing estates . 'Those who can't are naked in the face of predatory developers', Mr Aslet wrote. 'Communities that don't have local plans in place are similarly meat for the wolves.' The Government's policies were also denounced by Sir Simon Jenkins, the outgoing chairman of the National Trust, in an article for the Daily Mail. He wrote: 'Rolling farmland is replaced by warehouses, bleak housing estates, wind turbines and advertising hoardings in fields.' The Government is desperate to build more than 200,000 homes each year to meet booming demand. Under its National Planning Policy Framework, pushed into law two years ago, councils which have not earmarked suitable land to meet housing demand over the next five years must adopt a 'presumption' in favour of planning permission. Gladman Developments, which has a turnover of £200million a year, targets councils that cannot demonstrate a five-year housing supply. It offers to pay all the costs of obtaining planning permission – including the fees for lawyers and experts in the event of any appeal – which can exceed £300,000. If the attempt to win permission is unsuccessful, the farmer does not have to pay anything. The firm recently took out adverts in the farming press calling for sites of up to 50 acres on the edge of a towns or villages. Its adverts boast: 'We aim to never lose and have won 90 per cent of our housing planning applications. 'You pay nothing, win or lose. We only get our percentage after you have sold your land to the highest bidding housebuilder.' The firm has an astonishing success rate, having secured planning permission for rural sites in 41 out of its last 43 cases, despite substantial local opposition. Its latest projects include a site for 112 homes in the idyllic Slad Valley in Gloucestershire, immortalised in Laurie Lee's memoir Cider with Rosie; an estate of 107 homes within view of the summit of the Peak District's Kinder Scout; and a 970-house project in Lincolnshire which would expand the town of Louth by 12 per cent. Among its other projects are plans for 1,500 homes near Stratford-upon-Avon, and 70 homes in Witney, Oxfordshire, in David Cameron's constituency. David Gladman, director of Gladman Developments, insisted his company focused on 'sensible, sustainable locations'. He said: 'We are professional at what we do, and proud to help deliver homes and associated prosperity to these towns and villages. 'Everyone needs reminding that we all live in a home which was built on what was once a green field.' Planning Minister Brandon Lewis said: 'There remains strong protection of the countryside and Green Belt. The best way for councils to send speculative vultures packing is to have an up to date local plan.' Farmer Robert Bennett owns a share of the proposed development at Whaley Bridge which has been targeted by planning firm Gladman . Nestled in a valley on the edge of the Peak District, an easy drive from Manchester and Sheffield, Whaley Bridge is an idyllic but bustling rural town. But its convenient location coupled with glorious views has drawn attention from planning consultants Gladman Developments, which has submitted plans for 107 houses. As agricultural land, the 15-acre plot is worth less than £200,000. But with planning permission, the owners could sell it for about £13million – 65 times as much – with the developer taking a cut. And the developer could expect to sell the homes for about £235,000 each – a total of £25million. Local people are furious about the proposal, which will be visible 11 miles away from the Peaks' highest point, Kinder Scout. Andy Brown, 47, whose home of 23 years overlooks the fields, said: 'It is vandalism. It is completely eradicating the countryside, its history and its wildlife.' Mr Brown is a founder member of Whaley Bridge Matters, a group of more than 400 residents campaigning against the plan. The family of farmers who own the fields were offered a 'no-win, no-fee' deal by Gladman. Farmer Robert Bennett, 61, claims the land was 'no good' for farming. He said: 'Gladman approached us. They are always rooting about trying to find bits of land. We said if you can get the planning permission, then do it. It is a no-win, no-fee deal. They take a big cut if it goes through. They seem confident about getting it. 'People keep saying we need houses, but then they would rather look out on a field.' His cousin James Slack, known as Peter, farms 250 acres in the area, including the land earmarked for development. He said: 'There's been quite a bit of objection. I can see why.'","Speculators are  trying to exploit a loophole to  build houses on open fields .

"Helge Lund is in line to receive a massive £25million pay package as the new boss of BG Group . Pressure is mounting on the board of one of Britain’s biggest energy firms to scale back a controversial £25million pay package for its new boss. BG Group plans to lavish Norwegian executive Helge Lund with a £12million ‘golden hello’ on top of his annual £13million package. The deal was approved by the company’s board, which includes disgraced Iraq war diplomat Sir David Manning and former private equity boss Baroness Hogg. But it has been condemned as ‘excessive and inflammatory’ by business groups. Now it has emerged that the company’s pay committee – which is made up of five directors including BG chairman Andrew Gould – were themselves paid £1.2million last year. Mr Gould earns £727,000 a year. The committee, which is responsible for deciding the firm’s pay policies, recommended the £12million package to the rest of the board – which approved it unanimously. The chairman of the pay committee, John Hood, is the former vice chancellor of Oxford University. He will be paid £153,000 this year in total. The other members are paid between £98,000 and £115,000 – although the firm admits it also relies on ‘expert’ external pay consultants. Former UK chairman at investment banking giant Credit Suisse, Mark Seligman, is part of the committee along with chemical industry veteran Patrick Thomas and Vivienne Cox, who also sits on the ministerial advice board of the Department for International Development. Yesterday, Professor Hugh Willmott from Cass Business School attacked the ‘self-regulating elite’ of boardroom directors who set each other’s salaries. Directors have failed to ‘exercise executive restraint’ in waving through the eye-watering package, he said. He added: ‘Like a ring of traders, the market for executives is effectively rigged by the small number of players within it.’ A vote is being held on December 12 to approve the £12million package for the new head of BG Group, which is British Gas’s former oil and gas division. But two of BG’s largest shareholders have already criticised the pay plans. Corporate governance group ShareAction has started a scheme where the public can contact their pension fund and find out how they will vote next month. ShareAction boss Catherine Howard said: ‘BG Group directors very likely met privately with major investors to ask them if they would stomach this pay package, and came away thinking they’d get away with it.’ Simon Walker, of the Institute of Directors, has described the arrangement as ‘excessive, inflammatory and contrary to the principles of good governance’. BG Group has defended its offer to Mr Lund, who currently earns £2.5million a year for leading much larger rival Norwegian state-backed oil giant Statoil. A spokesman said: ‘His proposed remuneration is competitive in the international oil and gas industry.’ John Hood, the former vice-chancellor of Oxford, is among the board members of BG Group .

"An obese chip shop worker lost a huge 9st after missing out on seeing his grandfather before he died, because he was too ashamed of his size. Tolga Gunduz had been obese since the age of nine but ballooned to a top weight of 22st 8lb after becoming addicted to takeaways. At his heaviest, the now 24-year-old would eat three chip shop dinners and a family-sized cheesecake every day. Chip shop worker Tolga dropped from 22st 8lb (left) to 13st 8lb (right) by ditching his diet of junk food . He was so ashamed of his body that he refused to visit his family in Turkey for five years, meaning he didn't get to see his grandfather, Sevket Sert, before he passed away. Realising his weight meant he was missing out on quality time with his relations, Tolga, now living in Bristol, lost a massive 9st and has been named Cambridge Weight Plan's Man of the Year 2014. A trim Tolga says: 'I was scared to go back to Turkey because they're such blunt people. 'I'd get there and family members would say 'you've put on weight' and 'you'll never get married being that big'. His astonishing success, which involved stopping using food as an emotional comfort, has resulted in Tolga being named Cambridge Weight Plan's Man of the Year 2014 . 'I remember so many occasions when I was told I would die because I was so big. 'As a result I didn't go back for five years and didn't get to see my granddad before he died. 'When I realised I'd missed that final opportunity I knew it had gone too far - I had to make a change.' As a nine-year-old boy he was told he needed to lose weight by a stranger in the street . Tolga had always been big, even being told as a nine-year-old boy that he needed to lose weight by a stranger in the street. Despite being a keen footballer, he would sneak ice cream and sweets into his room to hide from his parents. Throughout his school years in London, he continued to fill the unhappiness with his body by eating more and more junk. As a teen he made constant excuses to not go to house parties because he was so ashamed of his clothes and appearance. Tolga said: 'No matter what the weather I would wear 44 waist jeans, a 3XL t-shirt and cardigan - all in 'slimming' black. 'I was in this vicious circle where I wouldn't go out because I was embarrassed my clothes didn't fit. 'To cover that up I ate, which obviously didn't help. 'I'd always tell friends I had family occasions so they didn't see me in the same clothes over and over again.' At 18-years-old and weighing 19st, Tolga went to university and moved out of his parents' home. Due to his unhealthy student lifestyle, his weight shot up by a further two stone before he failed his first year. Having reached his peak weight of almost 23st (left) and missing out on almost all of his teenage years, Tolga decided enough was enough and radically overhauled his diet . To cover up his disappointment at having to re-sit exams, he continued to eat, even when the family relocated to Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, to open a chip shop. Tolga didn't get to see his granddad, Sevket Sert, before he passed away . Despite passing his re-sits, Tolga rejected an offer to return to university and focused on the family business. He said: 'A whole life of being told I was fat really knocked my confidence. 'I didn't think I could chase the uni dream so I carried on working in the chip shop. 'It was my first job and in a strange place I was nervous and confused, so just kept on eating junk and drinking. 'At this point I was eating three to four takeaway meals per day and downing at least a bottle of rose. 'I was so ashamed that, not only did I not go to Turkey for five years, I didn't go back to London to see friends for two years.' Having reached his peak weight of almost 23st and missing out on almost all of his teenage years, Tolga decided enough was enough. He joined the Cambridge Weight Plan and, with the help of his consultant, Mitch Jones, confronted his problems instead of stuffing them with junk food. Within the first week, he shed more than a stone, followed by a further 7lb in the second week. Tolga said: 'I felt incredible - it was the lightest I'd been in almost four years. 'Whenever family came round, instead of hiding in my room, I'd welcome them at the door. 'In the second month I had the confidence to go back to London and see my friends. 'They were amazed with my progress and so I decided to go over to Turkey. Breakfast: Two Gregg's chicken baguettes, two chicken pasties, four doughnuts, two cans of Monster energy drink . Snack: Battered sausage sandwich from own chip shop . Lunch: Chip roll and a battered sausage . Dinner: A takeaway followed by a whole New York cheesecake washed down with at least one bottle of rose wine . Breakfast: Porridge . Snack: Banana or handful of fruit and nuts . Lunch: Low carb meal e.g. chicken breast and brown rice . Dinner: Fish or meat with either salad or vegetables . Snack (if hungry): A smoothie, piece of fruit or green tea . 'In the space of that fortnight I did two of the things I couldn't face for two years. 'In total I've lost nine stone, all while working in a fish and chip shop - I feel invincible.' After being named the Cambridge Weight Plan Man of the Year 2014, Tolga has decided to help people in a similar situation. He has decided to become a Cambridge consultant and has relocated to Bristol to pursue that dream. He said: 'Ever since I started the plan, life has been unbelievable. 'I've rediscovered my lust for life and found the real me. 'I can't thank Mitch enough - he's been like my big brother. 'Now I want to repay them - I feel like helping someone else will do that.'","Fast food worker Tolga used food as a comfort in his teenage years .

"On Christmas Day 1974, police officer Daryl Manzie emerged from what was left of his Darwin house and thought: 'We must be the only ones left alive.' The city's 45,000 inhabitants had spent a harrowing night lashed by winds so fierce they broke the recording equipment at the Bureau of Meteorology. At least 66 people were killed in the storm. Cyclone Tracy lashed down on Darwin on Christmas Eve 1974 . Manzie likened the noise of the wind to a speeding train bearing down on his home. 'It hit the house like a bloody giant sledgehammer and the house is heaving and moving, and the manhole cover disappears, and I get the torch and shine it up and the next minute the roof disappears,' he says. Although Darwin did have a history of being periodically destroyed - by cyclones in the late 1800s and 1937, and suffering extensive damage caused by Japanese bombs in 1942 - the relentless fury of Cyclone Tracy would change the city forever. It levelled and altered its essential character. At least 66 people were killed in the storm . Winds were so fierce that they broke the recording equipment at the Bureau of Meteorology . As Manzie puts it: 'Those that went through it were different people to those that didn't.' Darwin before Tracy was still a frontier town of opportunity and promise. 'It's always been a place to come if you're running away from something or looking for your next big chance,' Lord Mayor Katrina Fong Lim tells AAP. Jill McKerchar Kinang, who finished high school in 1974, remembers her childhood as an outdoor idyll, hours spent playing along beaches and in the bush in a small town where everyone knew everyone else. One survivor likened the sound of the wind to that of a speeding train . 'It was a dream, it was absolutely wonderful,' she says. 'But that freedom and sense of knowing everyone disappeared after the evacuation.' Before Tracy, there weren't many sophisticated buildings in Darwin. But once it was decided in 1975 that the city would be rebuilt - which wasn't initially a certainty - things progressed rapidly. Designs intended for homes in southern cities such as Perth or Melbourne were appropriated for Darwin so houses could quickly be constructed for the returning population. Survivors remember how the night changed the town forever, turning it from a town where everyone knew each other's name to a sophisticated modern city . Darwin inhabitants say houses and building were built in identical-looking blocks in the ravaged northern suburbs . Fong Lim says this resulted in identical-looking blocks in the ravaged northern suburbs. The Royal Darwin Hospital's design was intended for Canberra, and continues to be an example of some of the 'really stupid' planning decisions, she says. The newly introduced cyclone construction code didn't preclude good design, 'but where there was a need to build fast and just get them up, then you do get things that are a bit square-blocky', Fong Lim said. Recently, planners considering the city's master plan felt that modern Darwin is ugly, she says. The Royal Darwin Hospital's design was intended for Canberra, and continues to be an example of some of the 'really stupid' planning decisions . 'The city was reborn in the 1980s and that's what you've got, ugly architecture; it's a symptom of the time.' Author Sophie Cunningham, in her book Warning: The Story of Cyclone Tracy, quoted resident Vicki Harris: 'It was like a forgotten backwater, really, back in the early seventies. But in 1980 it was almost as if the cyclone had done it a favour by blowing it off the map ... it had really blown the cobwebs out of the place.' Manzie, who spent 18 years in the NT Parliament from 1983 and has seen four decades of change, says Tracy revitalised the city. 'You see what Darwin is today,' he says. 'I don't think it would have grown nearly as quickly. 'It was an exciting time; it brought new people into the city, new opportunities, new businesses.' It was a time of optimism. As southern Australia struggled with high unemployment, Darwin boomed, with the Top End slowly shaking off the grip of heavy-handed southern leadership that dominated the first few months after Tracy, .","Darwin was lashed with historic wind and rain on Christmas Eve 1974 .

"A distraught Michael Clarke showed incredible strength reading a statement on behalf of the Hughes family, following Phillip Hughes' tragic death on Thursday afternoon. With his voice breaking and his head down, he read a tribute from the 25-year-old's parents, Virginia and Greg, his brother Jason and his sister Megan. Clarke was with the Hughes family at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney for 48 hours following his devastating accident on Tuesday afternoon. Clarke thanked the hospital, his team mates and the general public for their support and wishes. Scroll down for video . Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke read a statement on behalf of Phillip Hughes' family after the shattering death of the 25-year-old cricket player . 'We're devastated at the loss of our much loved son and brother, Phillip,' a composed Clarke read bravely, not looking up from the family's statement in front of him. 'It's been a very difficult few days and we appreciate the support we have received from family, friends, players, Cricket Australia and the general public. 'Cricket was Phillip's life, and we as a family shared that love of the game. 'We would like to thank all the medical and nursing staff at St Vincent's Hospital and Cricket NSW medical staff for their great efforts with Phillip. - we love you.' 'It's been a very difficult few days, we appreciate all the support we have received from family, friends, players, Cricket Australia and the general public. 'Cricket was Phillip's life and we as a family shared that love of the game with him,' Clarke continued. 'We would like to thank all the nursing and medical staff at St Vincent's Hospital and Cricket NSW medical staff for their great efforts with Phillip.' Michael Clarke finished the statement with the simple yet powerful words, 'we love you.' Immediately Clarke rose and left the media conference to rejoin Hughes' friends, family and team mates. The Australian cricket captain had a bond with Phillip Hughes that went far beyond team mates. James Sutherland from Cricket Australia described the 33-year-old as 'like a big brother' to Phillip Hughes . Michael Clarke finished the statement with the simple yet powerful words, 'we love you' Clarke was the first player at Hughes' bedside after his catastrophic accident and barely left his 'little brother's' bedside . Choking back tears, Brukner made a special tribute to Clarke in Thursday's hugely emotional press conference, remarking that 'Phillip's family was obviously going through a difficult time, but I'm not sure they could have coped without Michael's assistance' Clarke was the first player at Hughes' bedside after his catastrophic accident, suffered while the batsman played in round four of the Sheffield Shield match between South Australia and New South Wales in Sydney. Clarke arrived at the hospital at 3.50pm on Tuesday afternoon, just 20 minutes after Hughes was taken into St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney in a critical condition, travelling by ambulance from the Sydney Cricket Ground. The Australian captain has barely left the hospital, leaving after midnight on Tuesday and Wednesday nights and returning first thing in the morning on both days. On Wednesday night, Clarke left the hospital with his arms around his wife Kyly Clarke and former team mate Justin Langer in a warm embrace. They leant their heads in towards each other silently following another day without improvement from their beloved mate. Michael Clarke leaves St Vincent's Hospital on Wednesday after visiting Phillip Hughes . Hughes and Clarke were close friends, with the cricket captain's wife Kyly calling Hughes their 'little brother' On Tuesday evening, Kyly Clarke described Phillip Hughes as her 'little brother'. 'It will be hard to smile tonight for @dancingau as my thoughts, my hearts and prayers are with my little brother Phillip Hughes and his family. Pls pls all say a prayer for him,' she said. It was only fitting that Australia captain Michael Clarke was the first cricketer to see Phillip Hughes on his last day on earth. Clarke was the first cricketer to arrive at St Vincent's at 6.20am on Thursday. He had been like Hughes' older brother - someone to rely on. Clarke was there for him again at the end. A fact Australia's team doctor, Peter Brukner, knew all too well. Choking back tears, Brukner made a special tribute to Clarke in Thursday's hugely emotional press conference. 'There is one person I would like to pay particular tribute to and that is Australia captain Michael Clarke. Phillip's always been like a little brother to Michael,' Dr Brukner said. 'Phillip's family was obviously going through a difficult time, but I'm not sure they could have coped without Michael's assistance. 'I was just enormously impressed at the work that he did and the genuine care and love he gave to the Hughes family.' Phillip Hughes was expected to take injured Michael Clarke's position in the Australian international side for the upcoming test against India, set to commence on December 4.","Michael Clarke read a statement on behalf of Phillip Hughes' family .

"A smoker is paying a heavy price for his habit after he was seen dropping his roll-up butt. Mariusz Jamrozek, 46, was handed a £75 on-the-spot fine after he was caught by two council enforcement officers in Burton, Staffordshire. When he failed to pay, he was summonsed to Stafford Magistrates Court, where he was fined £420, along with £180 in court costs and a £20 victim surcharge, totalling £620. Jamrozek, who describes himself on his Facebook page as a manager at Hilton Hotel at St George's Park, Burton-on-Trent, said: 'I didn't even know it was a crime to drop a cigarette on the floor - it's a tiny piece of paper. Mariusz Jamrozek, 46, was handed a £75 on-the-spot fine after he was caught littering by two council enforcement officers in Burton town centre . 'I will struggle to pay this fine; I only get paid around £1,000 each month and I have to pay for rent and my car with that money so I don't have much left. 'If they had told me it was a crime I would have just picked it up, put it in the bin and that would have been it. I won't be dropping another one from now on.' Jamrozek, of Branston Road, Burton, was walking through Burton town centre when he was spotted smoking on High Street by two council enforcement officers. Jamrozek was seen smoking in High Street in Burton (pictured), before officers observed him drop the cigarette butt outside Lloyds Bank . At Stafford Magistrates Court, (pictured) Jamrozek was ordered to pay £420, along with £180 in court costs and a £20 victim surcharge, totalling £620 . The officers watched him drop the cigarette butt outside Lloyds Bank and immediately stepped in to take action. Jamrozek, originally from Poland, told the court: 'When I came out of the bank there were two men waiting for me. They shouting at me and were telling me to show them my ID. It was very confusing for me. On-the-spot fines or Fixed Penalty Notices allow police and other officials to immediately punish people for with low-level, anti-social and nuisance offending. Fines were first introduced for littering in 1990 and have since been expanded for a range of environmental crimes as a result of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, and the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005. The majority of these are given out for leaving litter, dog fouling and fly posting. Penalties range from £20 for unnecessary idling of a stationary vehicle engine and £75 for littering, to £500 for failing to comply with a noise warning notice in licenced premises. Notices are mostly issued by local authority officers, but police and Environment Agency officers are also authorised to hand them out. 'I didn't know what I had done wrong at first as I don't speak English very well.' He was given a £75 on-the-spot fine, which he did not pay. Jamrozek was then taken to court where he was fined £420, along with £180 in court costs and a £20 victim surcharge. Councillor Sonia Andjelkovic for East Staffordshire Borough Council said: 'Council officers do a great deal to encourage people to behave responsibly but unfortunately a small minority continue to drop litter. 'It is only right and proper that we bring such individuals before the courts. 'Anybody found dropping litter will receive a fixed penalty notice of £75 or face the prospect of a court appearance.' Chief Inspector Steve Maskrey, from Burton's police team, warned that people littering could and would be prosecuted: 'I know that local enforcement officers at the borough council spend a lot of money trying to keep our streets clean, and people who carelessly drop litter do not help. 'I fully support officers handing out the fixed penalty tickets. Offenders need to learn that littering is a crime and it will not be tolerated. 'If they are seen by a local enforcement officer then action will definitely be taken against them.'","Mariusz Jamrozek was caught  by council enforcement officers in Burton .

"The NHS will continue to sell patients’ medical records despite its woeful history of blunders over the illegal use of private data. The Mail revealed in June that files had been sold to insurance firms and other companies without proper checks and balances. The data – including highly personal details of patient diagnoses, dates of birth and postcodes – was used to help calculate insurance premiums. The NHS will continue to sell patients’ medical records including highly personal details of patient diagnoses, dates of birth and postcodes. In June it was revealed the files had been sold to insurance firms (file picture) But the deputy chairman of the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), the body in charge of such records, said last night that the NHS would continue the controversial practice. Justifying the decision in a newspaper article, Sir Nick Partridge said: ‘We must make sure there are no surprises for the public about how their information is being used, that they have a choice in this and that we are honest about the balance of risk. 'Every single one of us has a part to play in making sure we get this right.’ The move is likely to anger campaigners, especially as a report published today after an eight-month inquiry will confirm that tens of thousands of records were wrongly passed to third parties. Sir Nick told the Daily Telegraph that proper checks were now in place to prevent misuse of records. Sir Nick Partridge, deputy chairman of the Health and Social Care Information Centre, justified the decision and said: ‘We must make sure there are no surprises for the public about how their information is being used' He said firms wanting to use NHS records would now have ‘to be clear about the purpose they wish to use the information for, and the ability of their own company or organisation to uphold fair and secure processes’. He added: ‘Until then we cannot supply health and care data.’ The NHS will not renew a controversial bonus scheme awarding GPs £55 every time they diagnose a new patient with dementia. The scheme was introduced last month to tackle poor rates of diagnosis in the elderly. But it was branded unethical by some GPs and campaigners, who claimed it could undermine patients’ trust. An open letter signed by more than 50 doctors argued that false diagnosis as a result of the sum would have ‘tragic consequences’. NHS England chief Simon Stevens confirmed yesterday the scheme would not be renewed when it ends in March. He told Pulse magazine the bonus was a ‘one-time’ chance to boost diagnoses. When asked if he had regrets over the scheme, he said it was too early for hindsight. An NHS England spokesman said the scheme was never intended to run past March. Officials admitted earlier this year that the details of up to 1.3million patients had effectively gone missing on at least two occasions as no record was kept of which businesses they were passed on to. After the scandal broke, changes were introduced under the Care Act in a bid to make sure third parties can only get their hands on medical data if they can prove it will be used to improve the nation’s health. An earlier investigation by the HSCIC found that patient data was handed to 178 firms a total of 588 times between 2005 and 2012. The companies handed data included management consultants and the private healthcare company Bupa. The insurers involved used the data to help set premiums by looking at who got certain illnesses, at what age and in which areas. The NHS charged administration costs and did not make a profit. Sir Nick, who led the HSCIC investigation, said in June there had been ‘significant lapses’ where officials had not properly checked how the third parties were planning to use the records. And he said the public would ‘simply not tolerate vagueness about medical records that may be intensely private to them’. The expert also said public health officials needed to earn the public’s trust by showing great care in the way their records were handled.","NHS will continue to sell patients' medical records to insurance firms .

"Nicky Morgan has delivered her strongest criticism yet of the culture at the Department for Education under Michael Gove. The Education Secretary last night said she wanted a partnership with teachers rather than a war of ideas. She said she intended to ‘tone down the rhetoric’ and was no ‘ideological warrior’ out to impose her world view on schools. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said last night she wants a partnership with teachers rather than a war of ideas . Her speech marks the clearest breach yet with her predecessor, who was widely seen to have lost the trust of teachers. ‘My request is that we tone down the rhetoric and let’s have a reasoned debate based on what works,’ she said. ‘For those looking for an ideological sparring partner to do battle with, quite simply I’m not your woman.’ Mrs Morgan insisted that she remained committed to Mr Gove’s reforms, which have paved the way for a new generation of free schools and a dramatic expansion of the academy programme introduced by Tony Blair. But she has been accused of a number of U-turns over his reforms, including scrapping Mr Gove’s policy of allowing misbehaving children to be punished by making them run around a playing field. Her speech marks the clearest breach yet with her predecessor Michael gove (pictured) who was widely seen to have lost the trust of teachers . Mrs Morgan indicated in her speech at Birmingham University that she felt uncomfortable with Mr Gove’s battle with the education establishment, which his allies dubbed ‘the blob’. She said: ‘Somewhere along the way, what got lost in the heated debates and the drive for change, was who these changes were for and why we were making them. ‘So let me be clear here and now. 'As Education Secretary I’m committed to implementing these reforms, not because I’m an ideological warrior, determined to impose my world view on schools and young people. 'The reason I support these reforms is for one simple reason. Because they work.’ Mrs Morgan replaced Mr Gove in the summer reshuffle, with a brief of mending fences with teachers. He was moved to the post of Chief Whip. Underlining her new approach, she said: ‘Too often education policy is portrayed as a war between rival camps of true believers, when the reality couldn’t be further from the truth. 'The best example of that? The thousands of teachers across the country who have quietly put our changes to the education system into action.’ Mrs Morgan also said parents should be encouraged to take more responsibility for their children’s education by helping with reading and learning times tables. They should also back heads who discipline their children rather than standing in their way, she added. And families should refrain from taking term-time holidays except in exceptional circumstances to stop children ‘missing out’.","Nicky Morgan said she wants a partnership with teachers not war of ideas .

"Depression should be re-defined as an infectious disease rather than an emotional disorder, argues one scientist. The condition could result from a parasitic, bacterial or viral infection and future research into the condition should search for these micro-organisms, argues Dr. Turhan Canli, of Stony Brook University, U.S. If his theory is true, he hopes a vaccination to protect against depression could be developed in future. Writing in the journal Biology of Mood and Anxiety Disorders, Dr Canli said: 'It is time for an entirely different approach. Depression should be re-conceptualised as an infectious disease caused by parasites, bacteria or viruses, argues Dr Turhan Canli, a professor at Stony Brook University, U.S. 'Instead of conceptualising major depression as an emotional disorder, I suggest to re-conceptualise it as some form of an infectious disease. 'I propose that future research should conduct a concerted search for parasites, bacteria, or viruses that may play a causal role in the etiology of major depression.' He divides his theory into three arguments. He said patients with depression exhibit sickness-like behaviours. They lose their energy, have difficulty getting out of bed and lose interest in the world around them, displaying the same symptoms as people who have an infectious disease. Studies of the patients with depression also show the presence of inflammatory markers in their brains, he said. These inflammatory markers might indicate the immune system has been activated in response to some kind of pathogen, which could be a parasite, bacterium or virus - this being what is causing the symptoms of depression, he argued. Women in positions of power at work are at risk of poorer mental health than women further down the career ladder, a study has found. Researchers found that while men tend to feel better the more authority they have, the reverse is often true for women. ‘Women with job authority – the ability to hire, fire and influence pay – have significantly more symptoms of depression than women without this power,’ said Tetyana Pudrovska, of the University of Texas, who carried out the study.2 . ‘In contrast, men with job authority have fewer symptoms of depression than men without such power. ‘What’s striking is that women with job authority in our study are advantaged in terms of most characteristics that are strong predictors of positive mental health,’ she added. ‘These women have more education, higher incomes, more prestigious occupations, and higher levels of job satisfaction and autonomy than women without job authority. ‘Yet they have worse mental health than lower-status women.’ His second argument is that there are examples of parasites, bacteria or viruses affecting emotional behaviour throughout nature. The best known example is Toxomaplasma gondii (T.gondii), a parasite which lives in the intestinal tract of a cat. There, it lays eggs which are dispersed into the environment when the cat excretes. When a rat comes in contact with these eggs and becomes infected, it becomes attracted to the scent of cat urine. The rat’s behaviour is through parasitic cysts being deposited across its brain, activating the same pathways involved in sexual arousal. He says one third of the world’s population is thought to be infected with T.gondii. The infection is associated with markers of inflammation, as observed in depressed patients. Of patients with a diagnosed major depression or bipolar disorder, those with a history of attempting suicide had higher levels of antibodies created to fight T.gondii bacteria. ‘Yet, large-scale studies of major depression and T. gondii or systematic searches to discover other potential parasitic infections have not yet been conducted,’ Dr Canli argued in his paper. Similarly, he cites a number of studies in which rodents’ emotional behaviour changes when they are exposed to bacteria. Large studies looking at associations between viruses and depressions exist already too, he said. He cites an analysis of 28 studies, which found a link between viruses and depression. These included the Borna disease virus (BDV), the herpes virus responsible for cold sores, varicella zoster virus, which causes chicken pox and and Epstein-Barr virus, which causes glandular fever. One study found BVD virus was 3.25 more likely to be found in depressed people than in non-depressed people, he said. Another found BVD in the brain’s of two out of 30 depressed patients. His final argument is that re-conceptualising depression as an infectious disease is useful when thinking about the genetics of the disease. If his theory is true, he hopes a a vaccination to protect against depression could be developed in future . The search for specific genes linked to depression has come up empty, he said, adding: ‘Perhaps, we have been looking at the wrong organism.’ While studies have looked for internal changes in human genes, which might explain depression, 8 per cent of the human genome is based on external changes, such as from viruses. Bacteria, viruses and parasistes could transfer genes into our cells, leading to changes in our genetic structure. They could also be passed during birth or through contact between parents and their children, he said. He concluded that large scale studies involving patients with depression and people without the condition should be carried out to see if parasites, viruses or bacteria could be the cause. He added: ‘Such efforts, if successful, would represent the ‘end of the beginning’ , as any such discovery would represent the first step toward developing a vaccination for major depression.’","Dr. Turhan Canli is a professor from Stony Brook University, in the U.S.

"The baby girl, who was sold by its own parents in China after they realised how much money they could make from child trafficking . A married couple who trafficked children including their own baby have been arrested in China. Gong Tan, 43, and his wife Li Ming Juan were detained at a hotel after staff overheard them discussing the prices of babies in Haiyan County in eastern China's Zhjiang Province. Police swooped on the hotel and picked up the pair just after they had finished meeting a contact. When arrested they told officers they had got into baby trafficking when 40-year-old Li gave birth to the couple's fourth child. They claim the were unable to avoid having another child and were desperate to avoid trouble due to the Chinese policy of couples only being allowed to have three children. They then contacted traffickers who offered them £1,860 for their newborn daughter. Gong said: 'This woman then went on to sell our baby for £4,140. 'We realised there was big money to be made from this so when she approached us again and offered us a full-time job in baby trafficking we agreed.' Police believe that Gong and his wife then went on a kidnapping spree and plucked babies from their unsuspecting mothers before selling them on. Spokesman Zhou Lieufei explained: 'We managed to track down four babies, one of which we believe is theirs. 'We are now running a DNA test on them to try and identify their real parents. 'We also arrested the woman behind this gang and she is currently being questioned. Another two of the babies that the couple are accused of selling. Police believe the pair went on a kidnapping spree and plucked children from their unsuspecting mothers before selling them on . 'We urge all families that if they have a child they cannot afford or do not want, to put them into an adoption programme. 'Do not sell them on to traffickers.' Child trafficking is a taboo subject in China, although they do acknowledge that the problem exists. However, there are no statistics about the number of children kidnapped or the number of children sold into adoption.","Gong Tan and Li Ming Juan arrested at a hotel in China's Zhjiang province .

"The fossil of a 247-million-year-old giant sea dragon discovered in China could be evidence that more species survived during the world's greatest mass extinction. The Nothosaurus zhangi, named after the researcher who discovered the fossil 2008, is described in Nature Scientific Reports as being 22-feet-long. Its unearthing suggests that other marine creatures recovered more broadly following the event known as the Permian–Triassic - or 'The Great Dying'. The Nothosaurus zhangi, named after the researcher who discovered the fossil 2008, is described in Nature Scientific Reports as being 22-feet-long. It could be evidence more species after 'The Great Dying' The fang-teethed creature would look similar to this and would have roamed the seas around China as many as 250million years ago . It occurred around 250 million years ago and was the worst extinction event of all time killing off 96 per cent of species. Today, all life on Earth is descended from the remaining four per cent of species that survived. It is unknown what triggered the wipe-out - but some scientists have blamed it on a volcanic eruption. The creature is part of the Sauropterygia, a group of aquatic reptiles in the Triassic period (era lasting from 250million to 0.25million years ago) that evolved from ancestors living in the Permian period - which began 299 million years ago . The disocvery was one of 22,000 found during a research project in China into how life recovered following the world's largest mass extinction . Among the findings were a number of marine species - including shellfish - that were alive during the Triassic period which began 250million years ago . A large number of the species in the Permian era died out, with some only recovering in certain areas. But scientists believe the finding suggests recovery is 'globally synchronous'. Jun Liu, one of the paper's authors, told CBS: 'The huge size is definitely the most apparent feature of this predator. 'They would eat anything they could catch, including large fishes and other marine reptiles at the time.' The associated professor at Hefei University of Technology added: 'This predator is in the top of the prehistoric food web. Modern leopard seals from Antarctic might be an appropriate analogue for this giant predator from the ecological perspective.' The fossil was one of 20,000 found on a mountain in China - including shellfish and pre-historic creatures - that revealed how life recovered after the worldwide extinction. This beaked creature was also found during the project. Around 94 per cent of the species in the Permian era (which began 290million years ago died out) during 'The Great Dying' Research revealed in October suggested there is evidence of a major marine extinction in the Arctic just eight million years before the Great Dying. An extinction event around this time has been the subject of previous studies, but this is the first to document the event in high latitudes. 'One of the pre-requisites for a “mass extinction” is that it has to be a global event,' Professor David Bond from the University of Hull told MailOnline. According to the history books, five mass extinctions have devastated the planet since it formed 4.6 billion years ago. Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago . This was the third largest extinction in Earth's history, and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years. Around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82-88 per cent of all species. Late Devonian mass extinction - 375-359 million years ago . Three quarters of all species on Earth died out in the Late Devonian mass extinction, though it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years. Around 22 per cent of all marine families, and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79-87 per cent of all species. Many of the archaeological digs took place on this mountain . Permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago . The Permian mass extinction has been nicknamed The Great Dying, since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out. All life on Earth today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived. Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction - 201 million years ago . There were two or three phases of extinction that made up the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction event. 22 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76-84 per cent of all species. Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago . The Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs. However, many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71-81 per cent of all species.","Fossil named Nothosaurus zhangi was found in China in 2008 .

"Theresa May has been accused by a senior official of delaying reports into immigration that are critical of the Government . Theresa May has been accused by a senior official of delaying reports into immigration that are critical of the Government. The head of Britain’s immigration watchdog, John Vine, accused the Home Secretary of failing to publish his inspections for up to five months after completion. In a letter to a committee of MPs, Mr Vine, the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, said Mrs May’s decision to control the timing meant ‘the independence of my role is compromised’. Mr Vine, who is standing down early from his role next month, wrote to the Commons Public Accounts Committee that he had worked with home secretaries since 2009 and had published dozens of reports independently of government. He said Mrs May wrote to him in December 2013 saying he would subsequently have to publish his reports through her department because of a legal requirement. Mr Vine said he took advice from Treasury lawyers, who questioned the Home Office’s interpretation of the law. ‘I feared at the time that a consequence of her decision might be that reports would not be published promptly, reducing the impact of their findings. My concerns have proven correct’, he wrote, in a letter seen by The Guardian. ‘The majority of my reports since January 2014 have been subject to significant delays between submission to the Home Secretary and being laid in Parliament.’ He said delaying the reports ‘risks reducing the effectiveness of independent inspection’ and told MPs ‘it is contributing to a sense that the independence of my role is being compromised’. Migrants run behind a truck to try to board it in the northeastern French port of Calais. File picture . Margaret Hodge, who chairs the committee, described the delays as unacceptable. One of Mr Vine’s reports not yet released involves Operation Nexus, a plan to deport more than 100 foreign offenders each week, which was submitted in June. A Home Office spokesman denied reports were sat on. He said: ‘Reports are laid as soon as they are ready for publication. However, some reports require significant consideration and this can cause delays.’","Immigration official says home secretary waited months to publish reports .

"A college freshman left in a month-long coma and permanently brain damaged after getting caught up in a fraternity party brawl has made a 'miracle' turnaround and returned home  for Thanksgiving. Jackie Lithgow, 19, was attending the Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania when he was assaulted by a student from a neighboring school almost nine months ago. Since the near-fatal incident, the teenager has had at least six skull operations and gone through hours of rehabilitation with meningitis and MRSA hindering progress. Wheelchair-bound: Jackie Lithgow, 19, was attending the Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania when he was assaulted by a student from a neighboring school almost nine months ago . Flashback: Since the incident, the teenager has had at least six skull operations and gone through hours of rehabilitation with meningitis and MRSA hindering progress . However, on Tuesday, the Boiling Springs native was discharged from the Magee Rehabilitation Hospital in Philadelphia with doctors giving him the all clear. Although he has made a remarkable recovery, the teen remains wheelchair-bound and has limited speech. Lithgow suffered a major head injury after an assault on February 23 at a fraternity brother’s off-campus house party. He  attempted to break up a fight involving four Kutztown University football players in the early hours of the morning when one of the men struck him. Smiley and outgoing: Lithgow (pictured before the attack) suffered a major head injury after an assault on February 23 at a fraternity brother’s off-campus house party . The punch resulted in Lithgow hitting his head on the curb of a pavement. A police report states that he was 'bleeding excessively from the back of his head and did not regain consciousness.' Days after the incident Kutztown University football player Angel Cruz, 21, turned himself in. He has been in custody since and faces jail time after pleading guilty to assault earlier this month. A second defendant, Justin Wieder, 21, of Quakertown, is also awaiting trial on assault charges, although he was not the one to deal the  blow. Commenting on the case, Columbia County district attorney Thomas Leipold told philly.com: 'Here's a young man (Lithgow) with a future full of promise, and was acting as a peacemaker, and he was struck with a single blow that has completely changed his life. 'And on the other side of the coin, for the defendant, he struck a single blow, and I'm certain did not foresee or anticipate how bad the result of that could be. 'And unfortunately, that just goes to show what the intersection of alcohol and ego and attitude can do, it can just produce absolutely tragic results for everyone involved.' Lithgow, who has no recollection of the chain of events, has spent the past nine months in hospital. His mother and father, Lisa and Jim, have stayed by his side throughout. His sister, 25-year-old Lindsay, has also been making near-daily visits. The family, who have no idea where they stand with medical bills, have been detailing Lithgow's progress via a blog, prayforjackie.com. They have also used the site as a sounding board for their emotions. On October 24, near the eight-month anniversary of Lithgow's assault, they described it as a 'senseless act of violence.' 'It is unthinkable and devastating,' the family  posted. Culprit: Days after the incident Kutztown University football player Angel Cruz, 21, turned himself in - He has been in custody since and faces jail time after pleading guilty to assault earlier this month . They continued: 'If any of us would have been told that eight months later Jackie would still be in the hospital, we wouldn’t have believed them. 'What he has experienced is more than anyone should have to endure.' The family also noted that Lithgow had been steadily improving but there was still a long journey ahead. 'During the process, we realized how far Jackie has come,' the post read. 'His body, so frail at times, made it through countless surgeries and infectious setbacks and had so many foreign tubes, drains and IVs we stopped counting.' Therapists Paula Bonsall and Erin Trudell, who worked with Lithgow from the beginning, say his brain is young and they're hopeful he will be able to walk unassisted within the next five years. Lithgow returned home on Tuesday and will be spending Thanksgiving at his grandparents' house in Hershey where he simply wants to 'pig out.'","Jackie Lithgow, 19, was attending the Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania when he was assaulted almost nine months ago .

"Many drivers often become the victims of road myths - from putting make-up on at the traffic lights to wearing a seat belt below your shoulder; these are among some of the most common myths that are often mistaken for on the road. With Christmas fast approaching and families planning road trips, Allianz Global Assistance is urging Australians to take caution on the road ahead of the festive season. Allianz Global Assistance spokesman Simon Wilson told Daily Mail Australia that Christmas is the most busiest time of the year and it's important to know all the basic principal of driving. Scroll down for video . With Christmas fast approaching, drivers are encouraged to take caution while travelling on the road . ‘From time to time, we hear these excuses coming from our customers and we don’t know where they’ve originated from,' Mr Wilson told Daily Mail Australia. 'First of all, plan your journey, especially if it's a long one. Plan all your stops so you're not suffering from fatigue. 'Second thing I recommend is to have patience on the road. I know it's a busy time of the year and we're all trying to see our loved ones and friends but road safety is essential. ‘The third is to  know the safely around yourself and others but the number one priority - regarding how urgent you have to get wherever - it’s more preferable to be late than being in an accident.’ Based on the company's 30 years experience with customers and road side assistance, Allianz Global Assistance have revealed the top five myths to ensure drivers don't commit the same mistakes again. One of the common road myths: 'winding down the window and turning on loud music helps with driving fatigue' The car insurance company found one of the biggest myths is 'men are better drivers than women' Winding down the window and turning on loud music helps with driving fatigue . ‘I think the message is there’s no substitute for stopping and resting. Loud music hinders and may actually add to the distraction when you’re driving,’ Mr Wilson told Daily Mail Australia. 'Everyone is always in a hurry but what we encourage is to plan ahead and allow more travel time and have a tactic in mind.' You can only be fined for speeding if you’re going more than five kilometres over the speed limit . ‘We’re not sure where it originated from but with today’s technology, I won’t take that chance myself. Even if you’re only going over by one kilometre – you’re still breaking the law and you will get a fine for speeding.’ The company suggests setting your alarm back a bit earlier so you're not multi-tasking while driving . Plan your journey: 'Especially if it's a long one. Plan all your stops so you're not suffering from fatigue' It’s okay to wear a seat belt below your shoulder if it feels comfortable, as long as you buckle up . ‘This is an interesting one - the leading causes of deaths on the roads are under the age of 35. 'Studies show that seat belts prevent these accidents from becoming critical. Even though it’s uncomfortable – it reduces minimal accidents and injuries. Wear them the way they’re design to wear because it’ll prevent some serious injuries. You won’t be distracted whilst putting make-up on in the car, while stopping at a red traffic light . ‘I know people are always rushing out the door but trying to multi-task while driving is not ideal. Set your alarm clock 15 minutes earlier so you have enough time to get ready and not be distracted when you’re getting ready inside your vehicle.' Men are better drivers than women . 'One of the biggest myths the company has heard are male drivers are better than women. It’s an interesting myth because we actually have more men making claims than women but it’s definitely one that leads a mystery,’ Mr Wilson said.

"Dramatic CCTV footage has emerged of the moment a man dressed as a samurai warrior and wielding a sword ran from police before he was fatally shot. Darrien Hunt was shot dead by officers after he was spotted with the sword at a bustling shopping mall in Saratago Springs, Utah. Now footage has been released that appears to show the 22-year-old ‘cosplayer’ sprinting away from officers in the moments before his death on September 10. Dramatic CCTV footage has emerged of the moment Darrien Hunt (top centre) ran from police (right) before he was fatally shot . In footage taken ahead of the chase, the 22-year-old can be seen walking past a convenience store carrying what appears to be the sword . Shot dead: Utah prosecutors announced that officers were justified in fatally shooting 22-year-old Darrien Hunt on September 10 . CCTV shows him running past a restaurant – quickly followed by police. In separate footage taken ahead of the chase, he can be seen walking past a convenience store carrying what appears to be the sword. The shooting prompted accusations from Hunt's family that he was treated differently because of his race and that his actions did not warrant deadly force. Hunt was black and the two officers are white. Earlier this month Utah prosecutors announced that officers were justified in fatally shooting Hunt, who was wielding the sword as part of a Japanese anime costume. Utah County Attorney Jeff Buhman said the two officers involved feared for their lives and the safety of others in the shopping area where the encounter occurred. Exhibit A: Utah County Attorney Bureau of Investigations Bureau Chief Jeff Robinson holds the sword carried by Darrien Hunt as Utah County Attorney Jeffrey Buhman addresses the media . The Hunt family plan to file a civil rights and wrongful death lawsuit, said attorney Bob Sykes, who has said that a jury would disagree with the finding that the shooting was justified. The fatal encounter was triggered by somebody calling in a report of a suspicious person walking with a sword in Saratoga Springs, a city south of Salt Lake City. Police Cpl. Matthew Schauerhamer and Officer Nicholas Judson spotted Hunt and began having a normal conversation with him, Buhman said. Hunt said he wanted a ride to a nearby city but when they asked him to give up his sword, he refused and his demeanor changed. That is when he swung the 3ft metal sword at them, Buhman claimed. 'This happened so quickly, violently and without provocation the officers had to use what was most immediately available to them, which was their firearms,' Buhman said. He said the investigation uncovered no trace that race or ethnicity played a role in the incident. Officers stand at the scene of the September 10 shooting in Saratoga Springs. Police deny Hunt's race had anything to do with the shooting . Heartbroken: Susan Hunt, pictured here holding a family portrait depicting her son Darrien (second right), plans to file a civil rights and wrongful death lawsuit. She said Darrien would not have been shot were he white like her . The findings of the investigation were based on interviews with the officers involved and three witnesses, he said. Buhman said after Hunt was initially hit by gunfire, he fled and disobeyed orders to drop the sword. 'It would have been a matter of seconds before he could have reached someone else,' he said. Sykes disputed that account, saying it was unlikely that Hunt was aggressive. 'I think it's a whitewash. I think it's an exaggeration. I think they ignored good hard evidence to the contrary,' he said. The Hunt family hope a lawsuit would bring changes in police training, he said. He said the sword Hunt used was decorative, but Buhman argued it could have hurt someone. At a news conference in Provo, officials showed the narrow, metal, 3ft long sword. 'The tip is sharp and the blade, maybe it's not sharpened to Ginsu or chef standards, but it's sharp enough to cut,' Buhman said. 'It is not dulled.' Armed: Officials argued that Hunt's narrow, metal, 3-foot long sword was sharp enough to hurt someone . Unanswered questions: Utah County Attorney Jeff Buhman said Investigators don't know why Hunt had the sword or swung it at officers . Investigators are unclear about why Hunt had the sword or swung it at officers, Buhman said. A search warrant showed that Hunt had been fired from his job after he did not attend work, and his mother had told him he needed to get a job or leave the house by the end of the week. His brother told investigators Hunt had been making and using a hallucinogenic drug and was 'obsessed' with a girl on Facebook who wasn't interested in him, according to the warrant filed in state court. The morning of his death, a friend said he posted a message on Facebook saying, 'I have a sword and I'm going to get shot,' investigators wrote. An autopsy shows Hunt did not have drugs in his system when he died of multiple gunshot wounds, including several to the back of his body. Saratoga Springs Police Chief Andrew Burton said in a statement he's pleased with the findings, while recognizing that the ruling may not bring closure to the Hunt family. 'It is our hope that the community can now move forward in the healing process,' Burton said.","Darrien Hunt was fatally shot by two police officers on September 10 .

"A man who got so fat he couldn't fit on the London Underground has shed an incredible 16st in just 10 months. At the beginning of 2014 Andy Butler, 33, weighed 28st and was so worried his enormous frame would get him stuck in a rush hour crush he'd get up to travel to work three hours early - to make sure he could fit on the London underground. Having conquered bulimia in his twenties, the pharmaceutical worker would starve himself of treats before gorging on them - and watched his weight balloon to dangerous levels. Scroll down for video . Andy Butler lost an 16st in weight this year, dropping from 28st (left) to a healthy 12st (right) in 10 months . But after he contemplated ordering a taxi to take him on a 100 metre journey last Christmas, he realised things had gone too far - and on January 1, He bought £150 worth of healthy food, started walking every day and ten months later has lost a whopping 16st. Newly trim Andy, who now lives in Liverpool, said: 'At my heaviest I'd go to work at 6am instead of 9am so nobody saw me on the tube. 'I was so self-conscious of people staring at me out of breath or sweating - or worse, me not being able to fit in the carriages. 'When I moved to London in 2012, I broke up from a long-term relationship and piled on ten stone in a year. 'I'd hole myself up in my room and gorge on about 10,000 calories a day. 'I was in a vicious cycle where I wouldn't go out because I was ashamed of my size so I'd spend my time eating.' Andy had had an unhealthy relationship with food since he was 15, when a throwaway insult left him devastated. Andy, pictured left half way through his amazing weight loss, lost 5st 10lb on his  regime of healthy eating and daily walks, before deciding to pay privately for a sleeve gastrectomy to lose the remaining weight . He became very aware of his figure and as soon as he ate something, would rush upstairs to vomit. Despite overcoming bulimia in his twenties, he would starve himself for days at a time, convinced that would maintain a healthy weight. Eventually, he would cave and eat one small thing before the floodgates opened and he would devour anything he could. Andy said: 'There was no set pattern to my eating routine. 'Takeaways were the norm for me, because they didn't need cooking so there was no time to talk myself out of them. 'I would swallow the food as quickly as possible in a desperate attempt to finish it all before I was full. Andy suffered with bulimia in his adolescence but has managed to finally overcome them and is now happy with his body . 'To compensate, the next day I would skip meals but then the pattern would start again. 'I would see people eat whatever they wanted, but pretend I was full. 'Then, when I got home, I would eat five times as much if I had eaten earlier on.' At his heaviest, Andy tipped the scales at  30st, but when he moved home he decided to seek counselling. Andy says: 'My surgeon was exceptional and played a massive part in changing my life. One evening he tried to walk around his block, but after getting halfway he considered calling a taxi. He powered through, and feeling ridiculously proud managed to walk two streets the following day. On his new regime of healthy eating and daily walks, he lost 5st 10lb by March and explored the possibility of surgery. He plumped for the stomach reduction surgery, rather than the cheaper gastric band, paying £9,000 to have it done privately . The operation, a sleeve gastrectomy, reduces the size of the stomach by 75 per cent and removes the part that produces the hormone that makes you hungry. Andy explains: 'I rejected the idea of having it on the NHS as I didn't want people judging me as another fat person getting a free operation. 'I was in the right frame of mind to have the surgery and went for it. 'Because of the exercise I was reasonably toned and wasn't left with a huge excess of skin. 'The surgeon, Mr Li, was exceptional and they played a massive part in changing my life. 'I've lost a further 10st and I'm no longer buying my clothes from plus-size stores. 'I can get both of my legs into just one of old trouser legs!' Alan Li, Consultant Bariatric Surgeon at the Spire Murrayfield Hospital in Wirral, Cheshire, said: 'Andy is a model patient, one who has been more motivated than most to lose weight. 'It is a very successful procedure and while it is expensive at about £9,000, in the long term it can save you money. 'One of our patients put what she used to spend on food in a glass jar and found that over four years she had saved £20,000. 'Weight loss surgery is not a vanity issue or a cosmetic issue, it is a health issue. 'It reduces your risk of Type Two diabetes by 90 per cent and of high blood pressure by 70 per cent and that has a huge impact on your need for healthcare and on your quality of life.'

"A woman teacher who spent the night in a pupil’s bed  wearing only her jeans and bra has narrowly avoided a prison sentence. Bernadette Smith was said to be infatuated with Gary Ralston, who was 16 at the time. That obsession cost the married 35-year-old her job and reputation, a court heard. Abuse of trust: Sheriff Wyllie Robertson told Smith (left), 35, . who kissed Gary, then 16, (right) and lay beside him wearing only jeans and a . bra, that she had committed a serious abuse of trust. She was spared jail . Waived anonymity: Gary, now 17, in his bedroom where one of the incidents took place. He said his relationship with Smith, who was his teacher during third, fourth and fifth year, began during secret meetings  at school . Gary, who waived his anonymity to speak of their relationship, said Smith had been his favourite teacher before she targeted him for particular attention. He said: ‘I was thinking I was quite lucky. A lot of the boys fancied her. I couldn’t believe she was with me. It was the last thing I expected. She said she thought she was going crazy but couldn’t help the way she  was feeling.’ Placing the mother of three under a supervision order yesterday, Sheriff Wyllie Robertson told her she had committed a serious abuse of trust. He said it was only the fact that she had not gone further with the boy that had saved her from a jail sentence. Gary revealed how his relationship with Smith, who was his teacher during third, fourth and fifth year, began during secret meetings  at school. ‘When I started year six, Bernadette was no longer my teacher, but we’d pass each other in the corridor, say hello and smile,’ he said. He said that Smith later summoned him to her classroom. ‘I walked in and as soon as I sat down she said, “Ever since we’ve been back at school and I’ve seen you around, I’ve been realising I have feelings for you”,’ he said. Sexual misconduct: Bernadette Smith, left and right leaving court, drove the boy to a park and kissed him . Describing himself as ‘curious’ and ‘excited’, Gary agreed to meet the history and English teacher on September 13 last year. The pair drove to a park in Falkirk, Scotland, and went for a walk but when they got back to the car, Smith kissed him passionately. Gary said he worried for Smith’s job, husband and family but said she ‘didn’t seem too bothered’. He confided in his father, who warned him to be careful but his grandmother called Bannockburn High School to complain. Smith was suspended immediately. Despite their relationship being made public, they stayed together the next night at Gary’s home in Cowie. The affair started in Smith's classroom at Bannockburn High School, Stirling, where she confessed her feelings to the boy, before the pair went to a park and had their first kiss . Gary said: ‘We got ready for bed and I felt nervous. I got into bed with my boxers on. She took off her top, but kept her bra and jeans on, and slid in beside me. ‘We cuddled and talked – nothing else happened.’ His father Richard Ralston, 42, said: ‘I wasn’t pleased about what happened, but you’re an adult at 16 in Scotland so I didn’t want to interfere too much. ‘I want Gary to make decisions and learn from any mistakes.’ Prosecutor Ann Orr told Stirling Sheriff Court that when interviewed, Smith said ‘she loved the boy and they both wanted to be together’. She admitted kissing Gary and staying the night in  his bedroom. There was no suggestion that Gary had suffered any long-term harm, the court was told. Smith, of Denny, Stirlingshire, pleaded guilty to engaging in sexual activity with a pupil while in a position of trust, between September 13 and 20 last year. Gary, now 17, revealed how his relationship with Smith, who was his teacher during his third, fourth and fifth years, blossomed during secret meetings at Bannockburn high school . She was placed under supervision for two years and will remain on the sex offenders’ register for the same period. Her solicitor, Andrew Gibb, said she was suspended by the General Teaching Council for Scotland and would be struck off at a hearing in a few weeks’ time. She has also separated from her husband. Sheriff Robertson told the court Smith’s conduct was towards the lesser end of the offending scale, adding: ‘It is serious enough of course when a teacher admits this kind of conduct towards a pupil. 'We expect teachers to ensure children under their care are safe from abuse and that has not happened.’ He told Smith that it may have been that ‘difficulties within your marriage contributed to this aberration’, but he said many other teachers coped without resorting to such ‘bizarre’ behaviour. He said it was to her ‘credit’ that she had not blamed her victim and she was assessed as at low risk of re-offending.  He ordered her to return to court on November 12 for a supervision order review.","Teacher Bernadette Smith said to be infatuated with student Gary Ralston .

"The ex-Commons clerk who clashed with John Bercow today took a thinly-veiled swipe at the Speaker. Lord Rogers, who was allegedly told to 'f*** off' by Mr Bercow before retiring early this year, was named Parliamentarian of the Year at a glitzy Westminster awards lunch. Collecting his award from Home Secretary Theresa May, Lord Rogers appeared to hint at Mr Bercow's eventual departure from his role, hoping 'common sense and good governance will prevail before very long'. Lord Rogers was named Parliamentarian of the Year, where he used his speech to make a thinly-veiled gibe at John Bercow's expense . Home Secretary Theresa May hosted the awards and presented Lord Rodgers with his prize . Speaker John Bercow, who is said to have clashed with Lord Rogers, was in the Commons this morning . Politicians and journalists gathered at the Savoy Hotel this afternoon for the 271 Parliamentarian of the Year Awards. Winners included minister of the year Steve Webb, politician of the year Alex Salmond and William Hague, who was given a lifetime achievement award. But eyebrows were raised by Lord Rogers gibe at Mr Bercow, who had been invited to the awards but was otherwise engaged. He stood down as Clerk of the Commons – the most powerful official in Parliament – after relations became strained with Mr Bercow. Today Lord Rogers, who now sits in the House of Lords, told the audience at the awards bash that Parliament had been through a difficult period. In an apparent suggestion that Mr Bercow's days in his job might be numbered, he added: 'I've every confidence common sense and good governance will prevail before very long.' The room of MPs, peers and reporters cheered. But Mr Bercow's place setting at the lunch remained empty throughout. Politicians and journalists gathered at the Savoy Hotel in London for the 27th Parliamentarian of the Year Awards . Mrs May hosted the awards, but struggled at times with technology as the projector used during her speech failed her . During her speech Mrs May used a series of photographs to poke fun at Islington, the constituency of Labour MP Emily Thornberry who landed herself in hot water last week for appearing to sneer at working class voters . Organisers say he had been expected to attend, after he had chaired questions in the Commons this morning. But a spokesman for the Speaker said the invitation had been declined 'several weeks ago because of a prior engagement'. Awarding the prize to Lord Rogers, Spectator editor Fraser Nelson said: 'Our winner knows more about the Commons and its history than any other living soul – he has, quite literally, written the book on parliament. 'After the expenses scandal and the demise of Speaker Martin, it was our winner who plotted the restoration of parliamentary grittiness which has been wonderfully evident in the past few years. 'He did so with impeccable impartiality. He did so with humour, scholarship, charm, a flinty adherence to democracy and the most splendid mutton chop whiskers in Westminster.' Other prize winners included politician of the year Alex Salmond (left) and William Hague, who was given a lifetime achievement award . Douglas Carswell, who this year became Ukip's first elected MP after defecting from the Tories, was named 'insurgent' of the year . During his acceptance speech, Mr Salmond produced a handkerchief from his pocket bearing a St George's Cross . Mr Salmond said he was 'honoured' to receive the award for a second time, having previously been recognised in 2011 after the SNP's landslide win in the Scottish elections . Mr Bercow sparked a major row with MPs earlier this year when it emerged he hoped to replace Lord Rogers with Australian Carol Mills the £200,000 post. In the Commons, Tory MP Michael Fabricant claimed Mr Bercow had sworn at Lord Rogers. In a debate in July, he said: 'Now, we do not know why he has chosen to retire early, though his working environment, behind closed doors, has not always been easy, as those in the know have already alluded to. 'In that respect, despite Sir Robert having studied Anglo Saxon at Oxford, being told at least once in front of others to f*** off by you, Mr Speaker, would not have encouraged him to stay.' At the ceremony Mr Salmond said he was 'honoured' to receive the award for a second time, having previously been recognised in 2011 after the SNP's landslide win in the Scottish elections. The former SNP leader said: 'This has been a momentous year for Scotland and, while the Yes campaign may not have won in the referendum, there is no doubt that Scotland has been changed utterly. 'With the SNP now the third biggest party in the UK with more than twice as many members as the Lib Dems, and support for the party surging in the polls, there is a determination in Scotland to ensure that real progress is delivered.'","Lord Rogers named Parliamentarian of the Year at Spectator Awards .

"A worker who claims she was the victim of a race-hate campaign by fundamentalist Muslims because of her Christian beliefs has launched a  landmark case against her former employers. Nouhad Halawi, a saleswoman at Heathrow Airport's World Duty Free shop, said she and other Christian staff were systematically harassed by Muslims. She alleged the intimidation included: . Sacked: Christian Nouhad Halawi who claims she was harassed by 'extremist' Muslims . Mrs Halawi lost her job at the perfume counter in Terminal 3 in July after 13 years when she spoke out about bullying by a small group of 'extremist' Muslims at the airport. The mother-of-two had been the subject of a . complaint by an Islamic colleague but when she . raised her own concerns as a Christian, she said she was the one who was . dismissed. Her case for unfair dismissal is being supported by the . Christian Legal Centre, who believe it raises important legal issues over whether Muslims and Christians are treated . differently by employers. Shopping: One of the World Duty Free stores at Heathrow. Mrs Halawi was a perfume saleswoman for 13 years . Mrs Halawi, 47, who came to Britain from Lebanon in 1977, said:  'I have been sacked on the basis of . unsubstantiated complaints. 'There is now great fear amongst my former . colleagues that the same could happen to them if one of the Muslims . turns on them. 'This is supposed to be a Christian country, but the law seems to be on the side of the Muslims.' She says that she had always got on well with her Muslim colleagues,but  the atmosphere changed with a growing number of employees promoting 'fundamentalist Islam'. Mrs Halawi told the Sunday Telegraph: 'One man brought in the Koran to work and . insisted I read it and another brought in Islamic leaflets and handed . them out to other employees. 'They said that 9/11 served the Americans right and that they hated the West, but that they had come here because they want to convert people to Islam. 'They say that Jesus is s***** and bullied a Christian friend of mine so much for wearing her crosses that she came to me crying.' She claimed she became a targeted for the fundamentalists after she stood up for her friend who wants to be anonymous because she still works at the terminal. In May, five of her Muslim colleagues complained to David Tunnicliffe, the trading manager at World Duty Free, accusing her of being anti-Islamic following a heated conversation in the store. According to the Telegraph, her description of a Muslim colleague as an allawhi - 'man of God' in Arabic -  sparked a row when another worker overheard the remark and thought she said Alawi, which was his branch of Islam. Heathrow: Complaint of religious discrimination by a sacked worker in Terminal 3 . Following the complaints she was suspended but was not told on what  grounds until she met Mr Tunnicliffe in July. Two days after the meeting she received a letter withdrawing her Heathrow security pass - needed to work at World Duty Free - because her comments were deemed 'extremely inappropriate.' Mrs Halawi, paid at World Duty Free on a freelance basis by cosmetic staff agency Caroline South Associates, was told that she would not be unable to continue working without her pass. A petition signed by 28 colleagues, some of them Muslims, argued that she has been dismissed on the basis of 'malicious lies.' The Christian Legal Centre has instructed Paul Diamond, a leading human rights barrister, to represent Mrs Halawi in taking both Caroline South Associates and Autogrill Retail UK Limited, which trades as World Duty Free, to an employment tribunal. A lawyer acting for CSA told the Sunday Telegraph: 'The case is still pending so the company is not in a position to comment, but as far as the company is concerned she's never been an employee and has never been dismissed.' A World Duty Free spokesman said they were unable to comment because of  'ongoing legal proceedings'. Last week, Jewish businessman Arieh Zucker complained that he has been repeatedly singled out for . full-body scans by Muslim security staff at the airport. The 41-year-old mortgage broker, from .

"A national day of mourning has been declared in Colombia to honour 32 children who were burned alive when the bus they were travelling in caught fire. President Juan Manuel Santos interrupted campaigning ahead of May 25 elections and . travelled to Fundacion, where the blaze happened, to pay his respects to the victims. Speaking to the children's families, he said: 'We are with you, the whole country is with you.' The children, who were being ferried home from Sunday school, died after the bus driver allegedly tried to refuel the vehicle from a jerrycan and the petrol caught fire. Scroll down for video . The president of Colombia has declared a national day of mourning after 32 children were killed in a bus fire (pictured, teachers light candles for the victims outside a school) Most of the victims, aged three to 12, were burned alive after the driver allegedly tried to refuel from a jerrycan and the petrol caught fire . The children were travelling back from Sunday school when the blaze happened. The bus driver had no licence or insurance, and the bus was carrying twice the recommended number of passengers . The infants, who were aged three to 12, died after becoming trapped inside the bus. Around 20 more were taken to hospital in a 'delicate state', according to the mayor of Fundacion, Luz Estella Duran. The driver and the evangelical pastor who chartered the bus face prosecution for 'voluntary homicide so that public prosecutors can request the maximum penalty' of up to 60 years, attorney Mauricio Ramirez said. Driver Jaime Gutierrez, who initially fled the scene, turned himself over to police as families sought to hunt him down after. The 56-year-old had no valid license and was driving the bus illegally. His defense lawyer is challenging the murder charge, asking instead for a charge of involuntary homicide, which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years. 'This was negligent conduct but not intentional. We cannot compare them to criminals who intended to do harm,' another attorney for the suspects, Diego Duque, said. 'He made a mistake but one cannot say it was deliberate,' Duque said, adding that one of the driver's daughters died in the fire. State lawyers are asking for the driver, Jaime Gutierrez, and the pastor who chartered the bus, to be prosecuted for voluntary homicide, which carries a 60 year sentence . Guiterrez's lawyer will argue that the the fire was not deliberate, pointing out that he also lost a daughter . Nelson Tapias, a 54-year-old merchant in the town, said he lost his granddaughter and several nephews. He said: 'I have my heart torn apart in six pieces.' Bus accidents are frequent in Colombia, especially in poorer, rural areas like the one near Fundacion where inspections and transport laws are rarely enforced. Gen. Carlos Mena, the highway police commander overseeing operations in Fundacion, said the driver was operating the bus without a license or insurance. The 1993 Dodge's registration papers were also out of date and the bus was carrying twice the maximum number of passengers allowed. Authorities would not say where the driver was being held, for fear he could be harmed by outraged residents in the rural town of 80,000 people. Gutierrez initially fled the scene but handed himself in after the community launched a witch hunt, while the whereabouts of pastor Roberto Padilla are still unknown . The whereabouts of the pastor, Roberto Padilla, was also unknown. 'Last night they wanted to burn him alive, so for his own safety they removed him from the town,' said Fanny Valseiro, who has been attending services at the church for more than a decade. Padilla, in a radio interview from an undisclosed location, said that the he and the rest of the church leadership were unaware of the bus driver's violations. Prosecutors said late Monday that they also planned to press charges against Manuel Ibarra, a member of the congregation who was responsible for contracting the bus.","Children were travelling home from Sunday school when blaze happened .

"Whether you're standing in an airport security line or waiting at a crowded gate, it would be nice to take the load off your feet while travelling sometimes. Now a company using Kickstarter to fund its new invention hopes people will be able to do just that with a handy seat that's so small it fits in a back pocket. The Sitpack is a compact seat made of a strong type of plastic often used for bullet-proof glass or Lego, which folds out into a seat on a stick. Scroll down for video . Take a seat: The fold-away chair has raised more than £90,000 on Kickstarter and would sell for £30 . Designer Jonas Lind-Bendixen says the idea for the Sitpack (right) came four years ago, when he was waiting for a band to come on stage. It folds into the size of your back pocket (left) The product - which would retail for $50 (£30) - enables people to rest their legs and back by transferring their weight to the seat attached to one long pull out leg. Danish company Mono+Mono recently introduced the Sitpack, and the team behind its design has to date raised more than 812,000 kroner (nearly £90,000) on Kickstarter with three days to go in its campaign. Creator Jonas Lind-Bendixen says the idea for the Sitpack came four years ago, when he was waiting for a band to come on stage and thought about how people are often left standing for long periods of time, leading to an aching back and legs. Rest easy: The young team behind the Sitpack have managed to raise nearly £90,000 with three  days to go . The monopod comes in various different colours to suit all tastes (left) and even the packaging is cool (right) The designer calls the product a 'monopod' and it is so small it literally fits in your pocket when folded up. 'Ive been doing sports most of my life, and through the sports I've accumulated various small injuries in my knees, back and so forth,' Lind-Bendixen said. 'All this waiting that you expect when you go to watch sports, go shopping with your girlfriends or travel. You wait for several hours at a time, which can be quite uncomfortable.' Designed to fit in the back pocket, the Sitpack can travel pretty much everywhere in a pocket or bag . Folded up, the Sitpack is 6.6 inches tall and 2.6 inches in diameter. To extend it, the user pulls out both sides of the horizontal seat and pulls down on the monopod, or extending 'leg'. The Sitpack is height-adjustable and can extend to about 34 inches tall. The seat itself, when extended, is 13 inches in diameter and supports a weight of up to 20 stone. When sitting on the device, the user must keep their feet on the ground just like with a traditional shooting stick. Balancing is therefore required but Lind-Bendixen insists this doesn't take much effort and supports correct posture. So does the Sitpack mean an extension of our sedentary lifestyles? 'It is better to stand up than sit down,' Lind-Bendixen acknowledges. 'But the thing is, how long is it better to stand up? When you stand for a long time, it's inevitable that your lower back will start aching. 'Your body is tired, and gravity does take its toll on everybody, so you need to sit down at some point. This kind of bridges the gap between sitting and standing all the time. 'With the Sitpack, because you're so high, you don't sit with all of your weight on it. You move all the small muscles, and you can keep your energy levels higher [than when sitting on a chair], especially when you wait three hours in the same spot.' The developers plan to have the product on sale by April 2015. What Sitpack says on Kickstarter: 'For the first time ergonomic seating is truly portable, inconspicuous enough to use in public and exceptionally functional. 'Sitpack lets you enjoy all the benefits of portable resting without being a burden to bring along. 'Imagine if you could pop out a foldable seat when your back and knees starts aching, watching your favorite sports or concert. Imagine not having to carry a clumsy chair with you when going hunting, fishing or bird watching. 'Remember standing in 2+ hour passport lines after 8 hours of flight or waiting for delayed transportation. 'NOW, IMAGINE: Having a seat in your pocket that will help you stay focused and active, keeping you in eyeheight with your standing friends, while being inconspicuous enough for nobody to notice!' People who want to contribute to the product's manufacture can visit the Kickstarter website for the next three days only.","Company's Kickstarter campaign has received £90,000 of funding so far .

"Police forces are stuck in a time warp, using out-of-date methods to deal with modern offences in substandard investigations, a report claimed yesterday. Inspectors found that only one in four crimes are being solved by police. A watchdog also said victims are routinely let down, as nearly half of the country’s police aren’t good enough at investigating crime. Yesterday Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) published a 243-page audit giving forces an Ofsted-style rating for the very first time. They were ranked as outstanding, good, requires improvement or inadequate in key performance areas including preventing and investigating crime, providing value for money and operating fairly. Detectives are failing to carry out house-to-house inquiries, take photos of injuries in domestic abuse cases and collect CCTV evidence on violent attacks, today's report revealed . The assessment revealed that police are failing to get to grips with cyber crime, child sexual exploitation and crimes against the vulnerable and elderly. Inspectors were also concerned about the ‘erosion’ of officers’ basic investigative skills in relation to crimes such as burglary and assault. A total of 18 out of 43 forces in England and Wales serving 28million people – nearly half of the UK’s population – need to improve their investigations, the report claimed. These include some of our biggest forces, with officers in London, Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield said to lack vital skills and experience. In the 18 underperforming forces, detectives sometimes failed to properly gather evidence from CCTV footage, take fingerprints, identify suspects and support victims. There were also problems exposed in the way forces deal with domestic abuse and violent crimes, with detectives not carrying out basic house-to-house inquiries or taking photographs of injuries. In other cases, investigation plans had been ‘cut and pasted’ from previous jobs. The shocking findings come just a week after the HMIC criticised forces for ‘indefensible’ failures in crime recording which see almost a million offences a year disappearing from official figures. Tom Winsor, the chief inspector, said ‘sluggish’ police had fallen ‘behind the curve of rapidly changing criminality’ because they were not recruiting the right people. He added: ‘The police in too many respects are policing many crimes of today with the methods of yesterday. ‘In the past the police recruited 18-year-old men to deal with burglaries and with street violence. ‘The kind of police officer needed today is much more tech-savvy and more sympathetic, with a wider range of skills – and yet today we are seeing the police predominantly policing yesterday’s crimes with yesterday’s methods and kit.’ Home Secretary Theresa May (left) is under pressure to improve police investigations following today's report by the Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor (right) Mr Winsor said top officers should take the blame for their forces being ‘insufficiently prepared for the crimes of the future’. And the report went on to warn that as a result of cuts, officer numbers will fall to their lowest for a decade, predicting: ‘The already thin blue line in our communities is narrowing still further.’ Steve White, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: ‘We have been warning there are issues around what the service can provide against cuts to funding and police numbers. ‘Although we are pleased that the majority of forces are performing well, we know that officers are struggling to provide the service they believe the public deserve.’","Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary said victims  being let down .

"A consortium involving Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Trains and transport group Stagecoach has won a £3.3billion contract to run the East Coast main line from next year. The decision  means that the two primary rail routes  between London and Scotland will be operated by the same two companies. Stagecoach and Virgin have controlled the West Coast Main Line  since 1997. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said it represented a 'fantastic deal' for passengers and taxpayers and would mean new trains and better services. The £3.3billion deal will give Branson (pictured) control of both of the main lines from London to Glasgow . The number of seats across the fleet will increase 50 per cent by 2020, ministers said. There are also plans for new direct links to Huddersfield, Sunderland, Middlesbrough. The award of the new franchise marks a return to the private sector for East Coast, which has been run by the Department of Transportation since 2009 following the withdrawal of National Express. The move was condemned by union leaders as a 'national disgrace' and 'utter betrayal'. Labour and transport unions had fought to keep East Coast in the public sector, pointing to the good returns it has made to the Treasury. The Inter City Railways consortium beat rival bids by the French and the UK's First Group. It will start the East Coast franchise in March 2015. But it is likely to raise questions over the prospect of Sir Richard's Virgin group running both of the main lines between London and Scotland and having a stranglehold on North-South rail travel. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, pictured, said it represented a 'fantastic deal' for passengers . Eyebrows may also be raised over the selection of Stagecoach to run the major rail route. The company's South West Trains service was recently lambasted by in Parliament over 'cattle-truck' conditions on its commuter route into the capital. It was also accused of treating passengers as 'cash cows'. Over the next eight years Inter City Railways will pay the government around £3.3billion to operate the new franchise. Mr McLouglin said this was more than offered by the unsuccessful rival bids. Inter City Railways said it will invest £140million to bring extra benefits for passengers. This includes complete refurbishment of the existing train fleet, better WiFi connections and onboard catering on the new Inter City Express train fleet. It also promised to improve ticket offices and introduce 170 new ticket vending machines and more than 500 new car parking spaces. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: 'This is a fantastic deal for passengers and for staff on this vital route. It gives passengers more seats, more services and new trains. 'We are putting passengers at the heart of the service. I believe Stagecoach and Virgin will not only deliver for customers but also for the British taxpayer.' Ministers added that rail journeys between London and Edinburgh will be 'transformed' by more seats, more services and new trains. The new deal will include 23 new services from London to key destinations, with 75 more station calls a day. There are plans for new direct links to Huddersfield, Sunderland, Middlesbrough, Dewsbury and Thornaby and proposals for more trains to London from Bradford, Edinburgh, Harrogate, Leeds, Lincoln, Newcastle, Shipley, Stirling, and York. The Government said there will be 3,100 extra seats for the morning peak time by 2020 and across the entire train fleet there will be 12,200 additional seats – an increase of 50 per cent increase. It said 65 new Intercity Express trains will be brought into passenger service from 2018, totalling 500 new carriages. Journey times from London to Leeds reduced by 14 minutes, and from London to Edinburgh by 13 minutes. Ministers said rail journeys between London and Edinburgh will be 'transformed' by more seats, more services and new trains. The new deal will include 23 new services from London to key destinations . And by 2020 all of the 65 modern high-speed electric trains will be in service and will replace 39 existing trains. Inter City Railways has also given a commitment to addressing the cost of train travel. It said it would look to reduce all long-distance standard anytime fares by 10 per cent - marking a saving of £15 for passengers travelling between London and Edinburgh. Virgin Group senior partner Patrick McCall said: 'We're delighted to have been chosen. Our long-term partnership with Stagecoach has seen a revolution in customer service standards, great product innovation, reduced journey times and improved timetables on the West Coast mainline. 'We plan to deliver similar success on the East Coast.' Martin Griffiths, Chief Executive of Perth-based Stagecoach Group, said: 'We have developed major programmes to help young people, communities and small businesses along what is one of Britain's major rail routes.' The Government said there will be 3,100 extra seats for the morning peak time by 2020 and across the entire train fleet there will be 12,200 additional seats – an increase of 50 per cent increase . But unions condemned the decision to return East Coast to the private sector as 'a national disgrace and an act of utter betrayal'. They pointed to the bumper £1billion windfall for taxpayers that was generated by the state-run East Coast mainline. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, said: 'It is simply ludicrous to even contemplate reprivatisation when not only have there been two previous private sector failures on the East Coast route but when the public sector rescue operation has been such a stunning success.' There had been speculation that a consortium of Eurotunnel and French company Keolis - which is 70 per cent owned by French state railway SNCF - had been chosen as the new East Coast operator. The other shortlisted bidder was FirstGroup - which has recently also lost its First Capital Connect and ScotRail franchises.","Consortium involving Virgin Trains has been awarded £3.3bn franchise .

"Retailers are selling full-colour cardboard masks of shamed entertainer Rolf Harris on eBay and Amazon as well as in special festive Christmas Markets. One retailer has made almost £2,000 selling the masks on eBay for £2.20 each, while a second company on Amazon is charging £5.99. Purchasers buying the mask on eBay through funkybunky.co.uk can even collect Nectar points on their selection. Masks of shamed entertainer Rolf Harris, pictured, were on sale online and at a popular Christmas market . So far, 789 of the controversial masks have been sold on eBay, with more than 10 still available at £2.20 . The same mask on Amazon, complete with eye holes cut out and elastic is on sale for £5.99 . So far, 789 of the controversial masks have been sold on eBay alone. In Edinburgh, the cut-out masks were on sale at a special Christmas market on a festive stall which was only a few yards away from a children's carousel. The paedophile artist was convicted of 12 counts of indecent assault in July and was jailed for almost six years. The Rolf Harris masks were on sale on a stall alongside others featuring cartoon characters, celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and Hollywood A-lister Johnny Depp. Following complaints, organisers of Edinburgh's Christmas said the Rolf Harris masks had not been 'authorised for sale' and were 'removed with immediate effect'. Edinburgh councillor Norman Work said he was 'shocked' when he spotted the masks for sale on the stall before he made an official complaint. Neither the council, nor the market's organisers Underbelly had been aware of the controversial masks before Cllr Work's complaint. He said: 'It’s distasteful. Maybe a few years ago it would have been OK to wear a Rolf Harris Mask but not now. 'I was just going around the Christmas market, browsing the stalls and just happened to see it. I was surprised to see them on sale. 'You shouldn’t be selling anything like that. I wish I had asked the trader why they were selling these masks. That’s my only regret. 'I wondered what they were doing there. It’s a bit inappropriate. We are talking about someone who is in jail. 'It’s not really in the spirit of the Christmas market to be selling these things. You could see the funny side if someone was wearing a mask of the Queen or a politician, but it wouldn’t be funny if someone was wearing a Rolf Harris mask.' One trader at Edinburgh Christmas European Market was selling the controversial mask, left, . Traders are supposed to submit a list of all goods being sold at the market to officials before they can trade. It is understood that the Rolf Harris mask was not included on the list by the trader. Bryan and Claire Laing, from Fife, who were visiting Edinburgh’s Christmas with one-year-old daughter Merryn, branded the masks 'tasteless'. Bryan said: 'I didn’t think anybody could be so stupid.' Another shopper, Tracey Malcolm, 24, from East Lothian, added: 'They shouldn’t be selling them, as far as I’m concerned. 'People could be walking about who have been the victims of abuse. They wouldn’t find this funny.' A spokesman from Victim Support Scotland said: 'We help and provide support to over 200,000 victims and witnesses of crime a year. 'It is not in the best taste. People walking around in Rolf Harris masks will hardly help the recovery of the victims of Rolf Harris. 'It should be in mind that these masks will affect how victims of crime feel and their experiences of the ordeal.' The trader manning the market stall declined to comment. A spokesman for Underbelly stressed that the product was 'not authorised for sale'. He said: 'We have also checked all of the other stalls, to ensure stock being sold is appropriate. 'We apologise for any offence that may have been caused by the entirely inappropriate sale of the masks by the trader.' An eBay spokesman said: 'eBay does not allow the sale of items that cause offence, or that relate to high profile criminals. 'We acted immediately when we heard these masks were being listed and removed them. Sellers that list offensive items may have both their buying and selling privileges restricted.'","One retailer is selling the controversial masks on eBay for £2.20 each .

"A wildlife park in the Netherlands is celebrating the rare birth of polar bear triplets. The three cubs were delivered to mother Freedom at the Ouwehands Dierenpark zoo in Rhenen, Utrecht, on Saturday, and keepers have been keeping a close watch on the new family ever since. The incredible moment was captured on CCTV cameras at the tourist attraction. At a wildlife park in the Netherlands, a mother polar bear has given birth to triplet cubs . In a rare touching moment, the cameras caught the mama and her baby bears having a cuddle. However, keepers have not yet approached the polar bears, so they don't know what gender the triplets are or how much they weigh. A post on the zoo’s Facebook page read, 'The birth of triplets is unique and rearing them is even very rare. The coming weeks so exciting.' The father of the three cubs is called Victor and lives in Yorkshire Wildlife Park in the UK, after leaving Holland last August. In rare CCTV footage, the zoo captured the mum and her babies having a cuddle . At this point, the zoo hasn't approached the cubs, so they do not know the gender or weight of the babies .","A wildlife park in the Netherlands is celebrating the birth of bear triplets .

"The mother of a 19-year-old student who was killed in an accident in 2012 has penned an emotional open letter to her late son's classmates as they prepare to graduate from college. Still mourning the death of her beloved son Luke Voss-Kernan - who died on a cross-country road trip with friends after falling from a structure he had climbed - Massachusetts woman Gisela Voss decided to pen some words to Luke's friends on his behalf. The mom first wrote a note to Luke, tearfully describing how much she continues to miss him, before putting together a moving missive for his peers, posting both of them to her Facebook page, The Boston Globe reported. Scroll down for the letters . Channeling her grief: Gisela Voss (right) as penned an open letter to the graduating classmates of her son, Luke Coss-Kernan (left), who died in a climbing accident in 2012. Luke would have been graduating college this year with his friends . Incredibly-touching tribute: Gisela Voss said she wakes up everyday and relives the realization her son Luke is dead. She has now written a gorgeous letter from his perspective . Voss begins the poignant letter to her son by trying to explain how much she misses him, writing: 'I will be longing for you as long as I live.' Luke, a 2010 graudate from Newton South High School in Newton, Massachusetts, 'was on a dream road trip to California having the time of his life' when he fell from an old fuel tank inside an abandoned gasification plant. He was in a fenced-off area of Gas Works Park in Seattle just after midnight when the accident occurred on May 25, 2012, according to Detective Mark Jamieson of the Seattle Police Department. People would often scale the fences to climb the old gas plant structures still standing in the park, boston.com reported at the time. It has now been two years since's Luke's death. 'I still wake up e-v-e-r-y-s-i-n-g-l-e-m-o-r-n-i-n-g to the newfound realization that you are dead,' his mother wrote in her letter. 'I relive the panic and the disbelief that you could already be gone this long.' However Voss becomes the most impassioned when addressing the classmates and friends that Luke left behind. In her incredibly-touching second letter, she tells them not to take anything for granted, to embrace life and enjoy it, and to never forget that 'tomorrow is not a guarantee'. 'I’m not saying don’t plan for a future that might never come,' the letter says. 'But use the fragile nature of our every day to propel you to always, always, ALWAYS . . . choose dreams over doldrums, adventure over avarice, memories over money, friends over . . . heck, over everything else.' You can read the full letters below. Tragic: Luke Voss-Kernan, a 2010 graduate of Newton South High School, died May 25, 2012, when he fell from an abandoned fuel tank at Gas Works Park in Seattle . Luke would have been graduating from college this year. His mother took it upon herself to pen a letter to Luke's classmates on his behalf . I laugh every time I think I’m never going to talk to you again because it sounds like the stupidest thing in the world. How can I exist in a world that doesn’t include you? I miss the sound of your voice. Your wrecked skater shoes thrown all around. The smell of your incense on your ratty sweat shirt. I will be longing for you as long as I live. This time of year feels so heavy. The two-year mark of your departure (who the **** can call that an “anniversary”) is coming, and the dread had set in before I even turned the calendar page. I still wake up e-v-e-r-y-s-i-n-g-l-e-m-o-r-n-i-n-g to the newfound realization that you are dead. I relive the panic and the disbelief that you could already be gone this long. Gone to where we cannot follow, until I have finished all of my days. And yet life — this life, at least — keeps chugging along. Most of your high school friends are graduating, Luke, and it’s not that I begrudge them their milestones . . . it’s just that on top of missing you, I am missing yours. So ... by way of channeling my grief into something positive, I dare write a letter to your classmates finishing college ... Dear friends, . To all of you becoming teachers, neuroscientists, musicians, doctors, artists, lawyers, lions, tigers, and bears — (oh, my!) — becoming ADULTS . . . How lucky you are to have the venerable privilege of finishing college. Of standing on the cusp of adulthood with the world wide open and ready for your contributions. For the utter gift of your presence here among us. Your presence in the present. Have you any idea, really, how extraordinary just that fact alone is? How the very breath you’re taking without paying any mind to it is a blessing denied to many? Close your eyes for at least one minute each day. Count 60 breaths and marvel at the preponderance of possibilities before you. Then vow when you open your eyes to remember, for a moment, that tomorrow is not a guarantee. Don’t let that thought paralyze you. I’m not saying don’t plan for a future that might never come. But use the fragile nature of our every day to propel you to always, always, ALWAYS . . . choose dreams over doldrums, adventure over avarice, memories over money, friends over . . . heck, over everything else. Speaking of memories and friends. Never pass up the opportunity to make some of each. Both nourish the soul. Especially together. Embrace their gifts and treasures. Memories can bring happiness or sadness, but because they are a part of you they cannot be taken away. Relish all of them. Squander none of them . . . the mistakes you’ll make, the bosses and jobs you’ll hate, the mentors and jobs you’ll love, the wrinkles you’ll grow, the babies you’ll birth, the years you will live — the-years-you-will-live. Give love and receive love. Boldly. Freely. Unapologetically. Love is the only thing KNOWN to survive death. If you feel it, say it. Risk it. Hearts can heal from unrequited love, but not from regret. Look up from your digital gizmos and look into each other’s eyes. Be present with each other — and with the unknown. Ask the big questions. Stand long enough to actually hear the answer to “How are you?” Sit long enough to ponder the answer to “Who are you?” Be happy, pig-in-**** happy, for what you have. Even when you have little. Or when you think you have little. Because just by graduating from college and reading this missive you have so much more than most people on the planet will ever have, or have ever had. Including time. TIME to be happy, fall in love, fall out of love, ride a bike, fall off a bike, get back on, write a song or symphony, paint a painting, pop a wheelie, stand in awe. That’s it really. In three words. Stand in awe. LVK .","Luke Voss-Kernan, 19, was on a cross-country road-trip from Massachusetts to California with friends when he was killed in 2012 .

"The parents of a toddler have hit out after their son was expelled from a nursery following a row over him being bitten by another child. Stacey Morris went to see bosses of Lilliputs Day Nursery in Westhoughton, Lancashire after her 14-month-old son Lewis was bitten three times in six months. After threatening the refer the matter to Ofsted, she was left furious when she was told Lewis could no longer attend the nursery. A letter sent to her by the nursery's owner states that it has a 'zero tolerance approach to threats and intimidation'. Stacy Morris says her 14-month-old son Lewis Nestor was unfairly expelled from his nursery after she complained about him being bitten by another child . Miss Morris and her partner Thomas Nestor said Lewis was very settled at the nursery and liked the staff who looked after him. But she and Lewis's grandmother went to see owner Gill Green after the bite marks appeared for a third time. Miss Morris insists she was not aggresive in the meeting and only said: 'If you don't do anything about this I will get Ofsted involved.' She was left shocked when, later in the week, she received the letter informing her of Lewis's expulsion. Mrs Green stated in the letter: 'This is not a decision that I have taken lightly, but [I] feel that our relationship is irreparable. 'Please do not attempt to attend the nursery at any point, my decision is final.' Miss Morris, who also has a four-year-old daughter, Madison,said: 'He's only been at the nursery since May this year and in that time he's been bitten three times. 'He was bitten twice in six days in August and on the first occasion staff didn't even phone me up to tell me - I only found out when I picked him up.' Miss Morris (pictured, right, with partner Thomas Nestor and daughter Madison) was informed of the nursery's sudden decision by letter, days after she went to see them . The owner of Lilliputs Day Nursery in Westhoughton, Lancashire says it has a 'zero tolerance approach to intimidation', but Miss Morris says she only threatened to refer them to education watchdog Ofsted . She added:'It was shocking really because he would have been so scared - he wasn't even one at the time. The mother-of-two said she had to have time off work while she tried to find Lewis alternative childcare. She told The Bolton News: 'Lewis has never done anything wrong. We have always been co-operative with the nursery and then I get this letter. 'I am hurt that now my innocent son's routine will be in uproar as he was very happy at Lilliputs and settled with the staff in his room. 'I feel I have been unfairly treated because they are unable to control another child's behaviour.' Mrs Green, owner of Lilliputs, told the local newspaper: 'We do not exclude a family for nothing and we welcome parents' feedback to help us improve and deal with things to the best of our ability. 'We don't do this lightly. We go through the correct channels and have worked with Ofsted in this case. 'We have found it necessary to put a zero tolerance approach in place with regard to threats and aggression.'

"Towering 4,478m above the pretty town of Zermatt below, the Matterhorn is a formidable challenge for any mountaineer. So spare a thought for Jamie Andrew, 44, from Edinburgh, who not only scaled the mighty peak but, incredibly, did so 15 years after losing his hands and feet to frostbite during a mountaineering accident. Now Mr Andrew says he hopes his feat will prove an inspiration to others struggling with disabilities - as well as those who fight shy of challenges. Scroll down for video . Long haul: Mr Andrew spent two years training for his attempt on the mighty 4,478m Matterhorn . 'I've wired my brain so when I come across an obstacle, my first instinct is to think how to get round it,' explains the father-of-three. 'When I see a failure, all I can think about is how to overcome it.' Mr Andrew's story began 15 years ago, when he and his friend Jamie Fisher were trapped half way up a mountain by a storm. Mr Fisher and Mr Andrew had climbed the north face of Les Droites in the Mont Blanc massif but found themselves beset by deep snow and winds of up to 90mph. So bad were conditions, the pair were marooned on Les Droites for four days and nights; a length of time that proved too much for Mr Fisher who died of hypothermia on the last night. Formidable: The Matterhorn, seen here from the banks of Lake Riffelsee, has claimed the lives of 500 climbers . Stunning: Despite its beauty, the Matterhorn is one of the hardest peaks to climb anywhere in Europe . Ready to climb: Mr Andrew in a photograph taken ahead of his attempt in August 2013 . Although rescuers eventually managed to come to Mr Andrew's aid, his hands and feet had been so badly affected by frostbite, he was forced to have them amputated. But incredibly, just a few years later, Mr Andrew was back on the mountainside. 'It took a while before I started getting back into the idea of wanting to climb again but it was always such a passion,' he explains. 'I knew that flame hadn't been extinguished. I also knew that if Jamie had survived he'd be doing the same thing. To me, it's always been such an enriching experience.' A visit to the French Alps and to the spot where Mr Fisher lost his life proved cathartic and it wasn't long before Mr Andrew began climbing again - starting with a small Edinburgh hill. 'It was quite poignant going back and seeing our old haunts and the mountains again,' he says of his trip back to the French Alps. 'It was just the same, even though I'd had this huge experience; it was all the same. I knew then, that it wasn't the mountains that were to blame and it helped me to come to terms with what happened. 'I just started to take it one step at a time, I didn't think about mountains to begin with; it was just about climbing up a hill in Edinburgh. 'Even that was hard to begin with but it was about getting stronger, fitter, improving my balance through practice, finding new ways around the difficulty. He adds: 'It was a big learning curve but every step was really rewarding. Every new thing I learned, every peak, however small, was a victory and a rewarding experience.' But while climbing the peaks of Scotland is no easy task, even the lofty heights of the 1,344m Ben Nevis pale beside the Matterhorn - a peak so dangerous that an estimated 500 climbers have died on it since the first attempt in 1865. Tough: Scaling the Matterhorn required hours of training and specially adapted prosthetic limbs . Intimidating: During training for his epic challenge, Mr Andrew hiked up peaks in the Alps and Grampians . 'It's a famous peak, it's iconic,' says Mr Andrew of his decision to attempt the formidable mountain. 'It's that classic chocolate box pyramid and even from a mountaineering perspective its difficult, even today. 'Compared to most mountains in Alps, it's difficult and I'd never climbed it even before my accident, so it was an obvious challenge. But it took a long time for that to be possible.' Making it possible included hours of training and having his prosthetic limbs adapted to cope with the rigours of the climb as well as the Matterhorn's quirks, which include sheer cliff-faces and paths strewn with slippery stones. 'Physically, it's such a big mountain,' adds Mr Andrews. 'The climb is 1400m - that's just exhausting and it's tricky the whole way. 'You have to concentrate the whole way because one stip could be disastrous. Finding new ways of using my prosthetics was key.' Despite the challenge facing him and the agonising muscle pain that he endured on the way up, Mr Andrew says that the experience was a wonderful one. Incredible: Jamie Andrew and his climbing partner Steve Jones during their ascent of the Matterhorn . Next: Mr Andrew hopes to scale El Capitan; a 2,308m escarpment in California's Yosemite National Park . Inspiring: Mr Andrew has trained himself to find ways around every obstacle in his path . 'When you're up there and heading for summit or on the way down, it's hard to appreciate your surroundings because you're focused and your thoughts are about getting job done,' he explains. 'It was only afterwards that I began to look back and appreciate the experience. When you're up there, there's this incredible panoramic view and you've earned it. You've earned every inch that you've gained and that is a terrific feeling.' Although his wife Anna had been worried about his safety, Mr Andrew says she and his friends supported him every step of the way and he hopes that they'll do the same for his next challenge - scaling  El Capitan, a 2,308m sheer rocky outcrop in California's Yosemite National Park. 'For that kind of climbing you use a lot . more equipment,' he explains. 'It's just a case of planning it and getting round the . obstacles, although it's not to be taken lightly.' When Mr Andrew isn't conquering peaks that would strike fear into the hearts of the able-bodied - let alone those missing limbs - he spends his time mentoring people who've lost their hands or feet and are trying to come to terms with their new lives. 'There's not many people who lose their . hands and feet but when they are, I go and visit, . and while I would never tell anyone how to live their lives, I do tell them that whatever . you're trying to achieve in life, if you give it a go, then you really can do it. 'People can do great things if they get their mindset right.'

"Ditched: Mike Stuchbery, 35, has left his job at a Norfolk high school after an 'anti-banter' blog post . A supply teacher who banned the word 'banter' in his classroom because it 'encouraged bullying' has left his job - and says he feels like he was 'forced out'. Mike Stuchbery, 35, stepped down from Lynn Grove High School in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, after claiming his teaching agency phoned him to say his services were 'no longer required'. He was called into a meeting with the head teacher on Monday, where it was agreed he would look for work elsewhere, he said. The teacher had sparked a national debate with his blog about 'banter' just two months after starting a career in Britain, where he emigrated after spending 12 years working in schools in Australia and Germany. Mr Stuchbery, who was on a three-month contract he hoped would be made permanent, described how he was banning the term because he believed teenage pupils used it to evade punishment and trivialise bullying. His blog post was shared online and published by educational supplements, sparking division among readers and - according to Mr Stuchbery - the silent treatment from colleages in the staff room. He announced he had left his job in a follow-up blog post, writing: 'I find myself wondering sometimes whether that job should even be in the classroom. I still can’t work out whether what I said was the right thing to say. 'What I do know is that speaking up as a teacher can have a pretty hefty cost. It is up to each of us separately to decide whether it’s worth it.' Mr Stuchbery said he had agreed to leave with immediate effect after visiting a doctor who signed him off for stress after the episode. 'I received a called from my agency saying that things had broken down and basically my services were no longer required,' he added today. 'I then phoned the headteacher and agreed to speak with her on Monday. I think the worst thing about the whole thing is the way I have been treated.' Critics had slammed the teacher's blog post I'm Banning Banter!, in which he suggested pupils used the word to excuse bad behaviour. Moving on: Mike Stuchbery has left his post at Lynn Grove High School in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk (pictured) after writing a blog post about how he had banned the word 'banter' in class . 'Banter, once a term that was used to signify ""light-hearted joking, a gentle ribbing of a friend"", now seems to be a catch-all term for any sort of off-colour or inappropriate behaviour,' he wrote. 'If I catch somebody nicking someone’s pencilcase, calling another student a derogatory name or thumping them on the back, nine times out of ten I’ll be met with a ""Siiiiir, it’s just bantaaaaaaaah!""'. After being published by the Times Educational Supplement and shared on social media websites, Mr Stuchbery attracted an onslaught of criticism for his view, with some readers labelling him 'pompous and arrogant', while others described him as 'a lefty idiot'. But Mr Stuchbery - who used to be an education blogger for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation - stood by his opinions today, telling MailOnline it was important to have a public debate. Mr Stuchbery said colleagues are restricted and 'terrified of the way schools observe them' 'If you have a private conversation things just aren't going to change,' he said. 'If you throw it open to the marketplace of ideas it's going to have a much bigger impact. 'I think the fallout is a shame and it says something about the way teachers have to work. 'I know colleagues who have trained and worked here who are terrified of the way schools observe them and make them teach to a certain style. 'Everyone has a different style and if we all spent all our time looking at spreadsheets and targets the world would be a much poorer place for it'. He is not leaving Britain, however, where he has gained citizenship due to his family's roots here. 'I love Britain,' he said. 'I'm a British citizen and I want to stick around.' In the aftermath of the row, Mr Stuchbery says staff at the school where he was teaching 'went quiet' and accused him of putting the school at risk of unwanted attention. 'I made a crack about how I’d made the papers while someone else who proposed dropping English as a subject hadn’t had any response,' he wrote. 'I was given the impression that I could have brought down Ofsted on the school (they’d been there the previous week) and that the kids might think I thought they were poorly behaved – that might be why I was getting the reception I was getting.' TV shows such as The Inbetweeners and Bad Education have popularised the use of the word 'banter', spawning catchphrases including 'Bantanamo Bay', 'Archbishop of Banterbury' and 'Bantom of the Opera'. At least one group of people saw the funny side - the pupils. He wrote: 'Everywhere I went I was greeted with shouts of ""BANTER!"". 'I decided to laugh with them, turning around in mock horror when somebody shouted it. The tone changed from a cautious hostility to something a lot warmer. 'A couple of kids came up to me and asked why I’d made my comments. I told them that I wasn’t opposed to banter - just using it as an excuse for giving others a hard time. Once we had the conversation, the kids were fine and the majority agreed with me.' MailOnline contacted Lynne Grove High School, but was told it was providing no comment.

"European Commission boss Jean-Claude Juncker has today survived a no-confidence vote over the 'Luxleaks' tax scandal - despite a protest staged by MEPs inside the European Parliament. In the parliament vote in Strasbourg, just 101 MEPs approved the censure motion filed by eurosceptic parties against the entire European Commission - 461 voted against it and 88 abstained. The motion focused on revelations from a journalistic investigation that showed Luxembourg gave tax deals to dozens of global firms during Juncker's 19 years as prime minister of the tiny duchy. European Commission boss Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured) has today sailed through a European Parliament no confidence vote over the 'Luxleaks' tax scandal . One group of lawmakers held up red banners saying 'No Tax Havens' just seconds before the vote, which needed a two-thirds majority to pass, but were ordered to remove them. The motion was filed by Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party, Italian comedian Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement and backed by French far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Juncker and his team of 27 commissioners, who took office on November 1, had been almost certain to survive the vote as major political groups had already said they opposed the censure motion. Juncker's centre-right European People's Party said the defeat of the motion 'sent a message of no confidence to Farage and Le Pen.' But it still took some of the lustre off Juncker's announcement a day earlier of a giant 315-billion-euro ($380billion) investment plan aimed at jumpstarting the stalling EU economy. It also came just two days after Pope Francis criticised the 'bureaucratic technicalities' strangling the European dream, in a blistering speech to the same parliament. Critics say political veteran Juncker is too much of a Brussels insider to restore the faith of increasingly sceptical European voters who turned to anti-EU parties like Farage's and Grillo's in European Parliament elections in May. The motion was filed by the Ukip Party under Nigel Farage (pictured above) Italian comedian Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement was also involved in filing the motion . The motion said that they have 'no confidence in Mr Juncker as the President of the European Commission'. 'It is intolerable that a person who has been responsible for aggressive tax avoidance policies should serve as President of the European Commission,' it adds. The Commission, the European Union's executive arm, is arguably the most powerful institution in Brussels with influence over laws and policies that affect more than 500 million people across 28 countries in what is the world's largest economy. The Luxleaks investigation revealed thousands of leaked files that showed Luxembourg allowed hundreds of top companies - including Apple, Pepsi, IKEA and Heinz - to enjoy tax breaks during Juncker's time as premier. Juncker has firmly denied any wrongdoing. When Euro MPs debated the motion on Monday, he repeated a vow to tighten measures against tax avoidance and tax fraud. Jean-Claude Juncker has begged lawmakers to 'please stop insulting me' after Marine Le Pen (pictured) compared him to US gangster Al Capone . But he also begged lawmakers to 'please stop insulting me' after Marine Le Pen compared him to US gangster Al Capone. He improved on the result when the European Parliament voted on the Commission's line-up in October, when it was approved by 423 votes with 209 against and 67 abstentions. There have only been eight previous votes on censure motions against the European Commission since 1979, European Parliament officials said. In 1999 the commission led by Jacques Santer resigned over corruption allegations to avoid a no confidence vote while another censure motion against the Santer commission was withdrawn months before that.","Jean-Claude Juncker survives European Parliament no-confidence vote .

"A maths graduate has been found guilty of murdering his father before dismembering him and placing his body parts in storage boxes which he used as a television stand. Nathan Robinson used a Stanley knife, a hacksaw and a saw to cut up the body of his father, 48-year-old William Spiller, at the flat they shared in  Bournemouth, Dorset, in May 2013. The court was told that the following day, Robinson travelled to Glasgow to visit friends and gave one of them a boxset of the Saw horror films. Brutal: Nathan Robinson (left) used a Stanley knife, a hacksaw and a saw to cut up the body of his father, William Spiller (right), at the flat they shared in Bournemouth, Dorset, in May 2013 . A jury at Winchester Crown Court took just one and a half hours to find Robinson guilty of the murder of the 48-year-old taxi driver. Robinson had denied the charge of murder but admitted manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility. He also took almost £8,000 of his father's cash after the murder and tried to clean up the scene with newly-purchased cleaning products. In the following month, he further covered his tracks by using his father's mobile phone, sending text messages to his partner, Glenys Molyneaux, and his friends. When Robinson was arrested on June 18,  a day after Mrs Molyneux reported Mr Spiller missing, he asked police if it was a joke. The trial has heard that Robinson cut up his father's body and placed the parts in storage boxes with a television on top. Victim: William Spiller (right) was killed by his son Nathan Robinson. Mr Spiller is seen with his partner Glenys Molyneaux, who is not Robinson's mother . His head was placed in a box and put in a filing cabinet. Robinson tried to clean resulting mess with a specialist steam cleaner he purchased from Homebase, but a neighbour living in the flat below complained of a 'pink liquid' seeping through the ceiling. Robinson told the court that he had only limited memories of the killing. He claimed that he had been abused as a child by his father and by another man on a separate occasion. He also said his mother, Elaine Robinson, worked as a prostitute and he had found an advertisement which she used to offer her services. The defendant told the court that he had completed a mathematics degree at Aberystwyth University but had failed to complete a masters degree in bio-fuels and managing the environment. He explained that he completed the taught part of the second degree but did not finish the dissertation after he became 'distracted' at finding out about his mother's activities. However, Nigel Lickley QC, prosecuting, said the likely motive for the killing was financial as Robinson owed his father £36,000. He also took almost £8,000 of Mr Spiller's cash, which he used after the killing to go partying with his friends in Scotland and to take his mother to a vegan weekend in Bristol. Robinson, wearing a grey suit, white shirt and tie, showed no emotion or reaction as the verdict was announced. The judge, Mr Justice Griffith Williams, thanked the jury and said: 'There is only one sentence I can pass, which is life imprisonment, but I have to determine the minimum term he will serve before the parole board will consider his release.' Following the verdict, Desmond Duffy, Senior Crown Prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service in Wessex, said: 'Nathan Robinson savagely killed his father, William Spiller and then went to great lengths to hide his crime. Winchester Crown Court, pictured, heard that Nathan Robinson remembered being abused as a child after he saw a flyer featuring his mother offering sexual services in cars in return for payment . 'It was the prosecution case that money may have been a motive for the crime. The 27-year-old, who lived with his father, accepted that his financial position was dire at the start of 2013. 'An I.O.U recovered from the flat which was dated June 2011 said: ""I Nathan Robinson totally accept that I am indebted to my father to the sum of £36,000 (...)"" 'The jury at Winchester Crown Court heard how the 27-year-old and his father had a history of disputes. 'On May 16 2013, they had argument; the argument was so loud that it was heard by their downstairs neighbour, who heard the sounds of a struggle and then Mr Spiller asking his son to get him an ambulance. 'Robinson did not call an ambulance. He admitted stabbing his father to death and cutting his body into pieces and storing the body parts in plastic boxes. He also admitted taking his father's money before leaving the flat. 'It was the prosecution's case that the defendant at the time of the killing did not suffer from any abnormality of mental functioning that would have diminished his responsibility for his actions. 'The jury heard that the way Mr Robinson acted after the killing could only show clarity of mind. 'Not only did he dismember his father's body, he paid the month's rent on the flat, purchased two Vax cleaners to remove blood stains from the floor and pretended his father was still alive by sending texts to one of his father's best friends and to his father's partner, Glenys Molyneaux, who became very worried and alerted the police. 'Robinson carried on his life as normal, supported by his father's money, by going to Scotland, meeting friends and organising a weekend in Bristol. When the police arrested him he asked them if it was a joke. 'Our thoughts go out to Ms Molyneaux and the rest of Mr Spiller's family and friends.' The case was adjourned for sentencing on a date to be fixed and Robinson was remanded in custody.","Nathan Robinson stabbed his 48-year-old father, William Spiller, to death .

"A love-struck former rugby star and his model bride-to-be have become a YouTube hit with a video he created of his surprise proposal on an Italian island. Garth Chamberlain, originally from Zimbabwe but now living in London, spent weeks secretly planning how he would pop the question to his girlfriend of three years, Swedish-born Tess Montgomery. With the help of Tess' modelling agency, MOT Models, he faked a booking for her to do a modelling job at a luxury hotel on the island of Favigana near Sicily. He had secretly flown the 1,000 miles to the same location to surprise her and set up secret cameras to film the whole thing. Scroll down for video . Romantic: Garth popped the question to Tess on an Italian island after planning an elaborate proposal . Plan in action: Garth had arranged for Tess to visit the Cas'almare Hotel in Favigana on what she thought was a modelling job. She's seen here arriving for the 'shoot' Meanwhile... Garth had arrived earlier and, with the help of staff, set up the terrace for a romantic meal with a stunning view (and put cameras in place to capture it all) Surprise! When Tess arrives on the terrace, Garth hides while she's given an iPad with a video he filmed earlier of why she's really there . When Tess, 30, arrived she was handed an iPad by the hotel staff on which Garth, 28, who used to play for London Wasps, had recorded her a video message. The footage included shots of where they first met in Wandsworth, London, and dozens of romantic photos of the couple together on their . adventures around the world. It also revealed how Garth, who now works as a project manager for construction company ISG, had travelled all the way to Sweden for a day to formally ask Tess's father, Holger, for this daughter's hand in marriage. The beginning: The video included a shot of where they first met at a pub in Wandsworth, London . ... and pictures of their adventures together around the world . Traditional: The video also revealed how Garth had travelled all the way to Sweden (without Tess knowing) to ask her father's permission for her hand in marriage . After Tess had watched the video, Garth then surprised her by stepping out on the terrace and going down on one knee. Tess is seen sobbing with delight as she gladly accepts his proposal. Tess wrote on her blog afterwards how it was all a wonderful surprise. She said: 'I can say that it was quite a shock . to be booked on a job and end up in the middle of a marriage proposal . instead. Garth had been planning this since sometime in March and . received help from my good bookers at MOT, so I really could not . imagine. 'I have no idea how they managed to keep everything secret so . long. That he could go to Sweden and back without me even noticing?' She added: 'I was stunned - Garth made the most romantic proposal in the world and I am one very lucky lady.' Proposal: After she's watched the video, Garth then stuns Tess by appearing on the terrace and going down on one knee . She said yes! The couple then celebrate as the sun sets . Garth told the MailOnline that all the hard planning and travelling to make the proposal perfect was worth it. He said: 'I wanted to take Tess away to propose in a romantic location, one of the classics, but since we hadn't been on a holiday in a while I knew she would be suspicious. 'I wanted to ask her Dad, Holger's, permission and didn't quite know how to do that, after many failed plans and attempts, it culminated in me booking a next day flight over to Stockholm, a half hour stopover and then a reverse journey back to London to avoid suspicions of me being out of the country. I'm glad I did that, I know it means a lot to Holger and apart for a crazy journey, totally worth it. 'Then I came up with the idea of booking her on a 'fake' job, with a lot of help from her entire agency at MOT Models, we came up with the perfect disguise, we managed to get her over to Italy after a little stopover flight, so I could get there before her and set everything up. 'Elena and Sonia at Cas'almare (the hotel) helped with everything that side and before I had time to breathe she was arriving and I spent the time in the hotel's basement hiding away in preparation for Tess to come down to meet the crew for her shoot... then she got the iPad...' Delighted: Tess couldn't wait to call her friends and family and tell them the good news . Tying the knot: The couple will wed in December in Zimbabwe . Ruse: Tess's agency MOT Models helped Garth plan the surprise . Tess said she and her friends and family were 'choked' by the lengths Garth went to in order to pop the question. She added: 'My family is of course . over the moon, I have four younger sisters who love it - their . boyfriends, maybe not so much!' As Tess knows Garth loves to film and take pictures - mostly so they can share what they are up to with friends and family around the world - she was not surprised when she discovered he had recorded their proposal. 'I'm so glad he filmed everything, because . now we have something to revisit when we want and that we can show our . children in the future,' she said. The original plan had been to only show the video to their friends and family and play it at their wedding, which will take place on New Year's Eve in Zimbabwe. But they then decided to share it on YouTube - where it was already received more than 13,000 hits - and Tess said they have been 'overwhelmed' by the response from well-wishers.","Garth Chamberlain faked modelling job for his girlfriend in Favigana .

"It's the home of Al Shabab, pirates and a civil war that has ground on for almost three decades but for some intrepid tourists, Somalia, or to be specific, the breakaway region of Somaliland, has become the perfect place for a holiday. And as these incredible images taken by French photographer Eric Lafforgue reveal, there's no shortage of things to do - whether you're in the market for a spot of culture or fancy a day on one of the country's spectacular Indian Ocean beaches. 'To most people, Somalia and Somaliland are one and the same,'  explains Constantine Savvides who travelled to the region with Lafforgue. 'Hardly anyone speaks of its struggle for independence and desire to disassociate itself from the violent turmoil afflicting the rest of the country.' Welcome to Somaliland: An elderly man photographed in the town of Baligubadle in front of a huge mural that depicts the national flag of Somaliland . Keeping the peace: Many of Somaliland's police force are female and boast specially adapted uniforms complete with the Islamic hijab headscarf . Meet the locals: According to Lafforgue and Savvides, most of Somaliland's inhabitants are only all too aware of the image problem created by neighbouring Somalia . Precious: Livestock is a key source of wealth in Somaliland, with camels proving particularly valuable. Here, a herdsman in Lughaya carries a newborn camel. Somaliland has functioned independently of the rest of Somalia since 1991 and was once known as the British Somaliland Protectorate, only joining the rest of Somalia, formerly Italian Somaliland, after gaining independence from the UK in 1960. But by 1988, relations between the inhabitants of Somaliland and the rest of Somalia had disintegrated beyond repair, with a series of massacres ordered by former Somali dictator Mohammed Siad Barre proving the spark that triggered a vicious civil war. When the beleaguered Somali government finally collapsed in 1991, Somaliland declared itself independent, although it is yet to be recognised as such by the rest of the world. Now, despite its proximity to regions controlled by Al Shabaab and to Puntland, another breakaway region and home to Somalia's notorious pirates, Lafforgue and Savvides say travelling in Somaliland is safe. 'Media attention has traditionally focused on the ongoing war between the Transitional Federal Government (TFG), which is backed by the international community, and Al-Shabaab, an Al-Qaeda affiliate,' explains Savvides. 'Most of the unrest is concentrated in an area referred to in Somaliland as the ""South"", which, as the name implies, comprises the bottom portion of the country including the capital, Mogadishu. Scars: . The rusting remains of a Soviet era tank outside the port of Berbera. Somaliland has been at peace since breaking away from Somalia in 1991 . Busy: A man outside his popular patisserie in the town of Boorama (left) and an elderly man selling the popular narcotic khat outside his house in Baligubadle . Non-violent: A young man in a dapper pink shirt poses in front of a sign that proclaims that weapons are banned in Burao, the capital of Somaliland's Togdheer province . Stunning: . A colourfully dressed woman and children emerge from a house that dates . back to the Ottoman Empire in Somaliland's port city of Berbera . Empire: The Ottoman Empire conquered Somaliland in the 1500s and remained until the British took control. Buildings such as this, in Berbera, remain . Beauty: Both of these women are wearing qasil; a popular local beauty treatment made from ground leaves that firms the skin while protecting it from the sun . Colourful: A woman photographed in a traditional pink niqab in the city of Boorama. Like Somalia, most of Somaliland's inhabitants are Muslim . 'Coverage has also focused largely on piracy in the Gulf of Aden where 16,000 to 22,000 ships, roughly eight per cent of the world’s trade, pass through annually. The sea bandits are based in Puntland, the easternmost part of the country and the very tip of the horn of Africa.' By contrast, Somaliland has a democratic government and the streets of its capital, Hargeisa, are peaceful. And despite being unrecognised by much of the world, it has struck up trading relationships with a number of countries, among them the UK, South Africa and Belgium. Now the Somaliland government hopes that the country's stunning, deserted beaches and ancient cultural sites will encourage tourists to overcome their worries and give Somaliland a try. 'The capital Hargeisa is a vivacious place,' reveals Savvides. 'The busy streets are lined with vendors of all kinds and there is a Russian MiG airplane war memorial in the middle of the city. 'The reason for all the Russian matériel is because Somalia initially aligned itself with the USSR during the Cold War. But when the Soviets intervened in the Ogaden War and supported Somalia’s arch-rival, Ethiopia, the Somalis quickly shifted their allegiance to the United States.' Further along the coast is the city of Berbera, a port that began life as the ancient town of Malao in the first century B.C, and is described by Lafforgue and Savvides as having 'a relaxed seaside atmosphere', although the city centre does still bear the marks of war. Unlike its war-torn neighbour, Somalia, Somaliland is a peaceful democracy that boasts trade links with South Africa, Belgium, Ethiopia and the UK among others. But it wasn't always so. For substantial chunks of its history, Somaliland has been ruled by foreign powers and was a part of the Ottoman Empire for almost 400 years before being incorporated into the British Empire as British Somaliland. Then, as now, Somaliland was separate and bordered what was then Italian Somaliland. When independence came on the 26th June 1960, Somaliland became a sovereign state; a state of affairs that lasted just five days before the country became part of Somalia. Peace, however, would prove elusive, and a tumultuous political saga soon began, thanks to the violent totalitarian regime of dictator, Mohammed Siad Barre. When Barre’s dictatorship was overthrown in 1991, Somalia quickly descended into a state of anarchy with warlords battling for power. On May 18th of that same year, Somaliland declared its independence from the rest of the country, attempting to reclaim what it once had. Today, while fighting continues in the rest of Somalia, Somaliland is now stable and hopes to be recognised as a fully independent state by the wider world. Open for business: Somaliland is dotted with signs like this one, which is an advertising hoarding for a garage that repairs cars and sells car parts . Handy: A man transports a traditional agal soomaali hut on the back of his camel in the Zeila province. Camels remain an integral part of life in Somaliland . Nomadic: Somaliland is still home to some nomadic tribes who spend their lives in the country's deserts. Here, a nomadic woman is seen with a bottle of camel milk . Cultural sights: The ancient Laas Gaal cave paintings just outside Berbera (left) and the MiG fighter plane memorial in the centre of Somaliland's capital Hargeisa . Trade: Many of the camels raised in Somaliland are sold overseas, with Berbera's proximity to the Arabian peninsula making it a popular departure point . Within striking distance of Berbera are the ancient Laas Gaal cave paintings, which are thought to date from 9,000 B.C. 'The Neolithic art depicts humans and a range of animals in a variety of positions,' adds Savvides. 'They're amazingly well preserved with vibrant colours and clear outlines, and look a little bit like Picasso's work.' Equally impressive, reveals Savvides, are the locals; most of whom proved incredibly welcoming. 'Many women wear qasil, a natural beauty product that rejuvenates skin and protects from the sun,' he adds. 'It is made from the ground leaves of a tree and it gives their faces a yellow tint - an effect made all the more alluring when coupled with colourful clothing.' Despite their charm, many in Somaliland are all too aware of the image problem created by the ongoing violence across the Somali border and hope more visitors will come to the region so they can see how different things really are. 'The people of Somaliland are very aware of their tarnished public image due to their historical association with Puntland and the South,' explains Savvides. 'In every city I visited, people urged me to show how Somaliland was different from Somalia. They want the world to know that it's peaceful. Though Somaliland may share a common history, language, and blood with the South, the people of Somaliland deserve to be seen differently.' Culture clash: Although Somaliland retains its Islamic identity, teenagers such as this girl, right, have picked up some of the gestures found in Western hip hop videos . Colourful: Women living in Somaliland tend to choose brighter clothes than those living in Egypt and in Yemen and Saudi Arabia on the other side of the Gulf of Aden . Ruins: The remains of a British colonial house outside El Sheikh. Many were destroyed in the fighting, leaving only the chimneys still standing . Modern: A man advertising X-ray services in Hargeisa, where many of the best doctors in the region are found, and the lovely Baathela Beach just outside Berbera . Ruins: A man walks through the remains of what was once the Burao Technology Institute - one of the many buildings destroyed by war in the late 1980s .","Somaliland is a breakaway region of Somalia that declared independence from the rest in 1991 .

"A 13,000-year-old bone fragment with an engraving of a mammoth or mastodon has been found in Florida. Scientists believe the etching is the oldest, and only known, example of Ice Age art to depict a proboscidean - or an animal with a trunk - in the Americas. The bone was found in Vero Beach by amateur fossil hunter James Kennedy, who later discovered the engraving while cleaning it. Researchers claim it is evidence that people living in the Americas during the . last Ice Age created artistic images of the animals they hunted. Evidence: Scientists believe this etching is the oldest, and only known, example of Ice Age art to depict an animal with a trunk in the Americas. It on a bone recently found on a Florida beach . The . engraving is at least 13,000 years old - this is the date of the last . appearance of these animals in eastern North America, and more recent pre-Columbian people would not have seen a mammoth or mastodon to draw. Researcher Dennis Stanford, of the Smithsonian Institute, said: 'This is an incredibly exciting discovery. 'There are hundreds of depictions of proboscideans on cave walls and carved into bones in Europe, but none from America - until now.' The engraving is three-inches long from the top of the head to the tip of the tail, and 1.75inches tall from the top of the head to the bottom of the right foreleg. The fossil bone is a fragment from a long bone of a large mammal - most likely either a mammoth or mastodon, or less likely a giant sloth. A precise identification was not possible because of the bone's fragmented condition and lack of diagnostic features. Lead researcher Barbara Purdy, of the University of Florida, said: 'The results of this investigation are an excellent example of the value of interdisciplinary research and cooperation among scientists. 'There was considerable scepticism expressed about the authenticity of the incising on the bone until it was examined exhaustively by archaeologists, paleontologists, forensic anthropologists, materials science engineers and artists.' The bone was found in Vero Beach by amateur fossil hunter James Kennedy, who later discovered the engraving while cleaning it . One of the main goals for the scientists was to investigate the timing of the engraving - was it ancient or was it recently engraved to mimic an example of prehistoric art? It was originally found near a location, known as the Old Vero site, where human bones were discovered side-by-side with the bones of extinct Ice Age animals in an excavation from 1913 to 1916. The team examined the elemental composition of the engraved bone and others from the Old Vero site. They also used optical and electron microscopy, which showed no discontinuity in colouration between the carved grooves and the surrounding material. This indicated that both surfaces aged simultaneously and that the edges of the carving were worn and showed no signs of being carved recently or that the grooves were made with metal tools. The team's research also further validates the findings of geologist Elias Howard Sellards at the Old Vero Site in the early twentieth century. His claims that people were in North America and hunted animals at Vero Beach during the last Ice Age have been disputed over the past 95 years. A cast of the carved fossil bone is now part of an exhibit of Florida Mammoth and Mastodons at the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville. The team's research is published in the Journal of Archaeological Science.","Bone fragment with engraving is believed to be at least 13,000 years old .

"Britain is free to ban foreign doctors if they cannot speak English or there are concerns about their professional ability, an EU Commissioner said today. Michel Barnier said it was a myth that rules in Brussels require the UK to employ EU doctors without evidence that their language and medical skills are of an acceptable standard. The issue of foreign doctors' language ability became a national issue two years ago when German-trained GP Dr Daniel Ubani killed British pensioner David Gray, 70, by giving him 10 times the normal dose of diamorphine. Michel Barnier said any issues associated with foreign doctors should be dealt with by the NHS . Dr Ubani, who was on his first out of hours shift in the UK, said he was confused about the difference between drugs used here and in Germany. Writing in the Daily Telegraph today, Mr Barnier, commissioner for the internal market, insisted: 'Doctors' suitability for the role they will be performing should be properly scrutinised by those who will be employing them. 'Patients are obviously right to insist that those treating them can communicate properly. German-trained locum Daniel Ubani killed British man David Gray in 2009 after giving him 10 times  the normal dose of diamorphine . 'Language checks are not explicitly imposed by EU law. But neither are they outlawed. The Commission has never understood why the UK imposed a strict ban on language ability checks.' Mr Barnier's comments came after it emerged last week that fewer than one in ten hospitals check whether nurses from Europe can adequately speak English before letting them work on wards. Language problems often only come to light when patients find that their requests for more pain relief or different food are not understood, according to an NHS watchdog. The Department of Health and the Royal College of Nursing have told hospitals it is their responsibility to make adequate checks but the guidance is not always passed on to managers in charge of recruitment. Foreign nurses coming to work in England from outside the EU have to undergo rigorous English exams that last up to five hours before they can join the NMC register. Today David Gray's son Rory described the EU Commissioner's comments . as 'dangerous', as he believes it is not always possible for individual . employers to carry out background checks. Tragedy: David Gray died after being given a massive overdose of painkillers by Dr Ubani . Rory Gray said he believes a single, national medical regulator like the General Medical Council should take charge of background checks on doctors, as they are in a better position to do so than individual hospitals. Mr Gray told MailOnline: 'It is obviously much safer to have the single national medical regulator be allowed to check all EU doctors' competency at the point of registration, exaclty like they do for non-EEA doctors. 'The GMC have the know-how, resources, capability and vast experience of doing this. 'To leave it to each of hundreds of doctors' employers around the country to carry out the checks as they see fit has been a deadly failure. 'Some employers will no doubt perform adequate checks but inevitably others will not.' Foreign nurses coming to work in England from outside the EU have to undergo rigorous English exams that last up to five hours before they can join the NMC register. But fewer than one in ten NHS trusts are bothering to set their own tests or demand to see proof that nurses have reached an appropriate standard of English, according to Freedom of Information requests obtained by the Daily Mail. Professor Norman Williams, president of the Royal College of Surgeons and Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians, say 'urgent action' is needed to combat 'huge variations' in the quality and training of foreign doctors.","Brussels rules requiring UK to employ EU doctors without evidence is a 'myth'

"Environmental groups have won the latest battle in their effort to halt a wolf- and coyote-shooting derby in Idaho, but a pro-hunting group says the contest with cash prizes for whoever kills the most predators will go on as planned early next year. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, facing two federal lawsuits from conservation groups, canceled a permit late Tuesday issued to derby organizer Idaho for Wildlife on Nov. 13. The agency didn't mention the lawsuits in a statement but said modifications to derby rules made by the pro-hunting group after receiving the permit left it unclear if the permit could still apply without another round of analysis. Environmental groups have won the latest battle in their effort to halt a wolf- and coyote-shooting derby in Idaho, but a pro-hunting group says the contest with cash prizes for whoever kills the most predators will go on as planned early next year . 'We were expecting a fight, so it's nice to see the BLM had a change of heart,' said Laura King, an attorney for the Western Environmental Law Center. 'This is some of the wildest land in America. It is a safe haven for an iconic species that is just getting its foothold in the West.' Steve Alder of Idaho for Wildlife said BLM officials caved in to environmental groups. 'Somebody in (Washington), D.C., twisted that I was trying to change the application so they could blame us,' he said. 'They're trying to blame somebody else because they couldn't take the heat.' Alder said the derby still would be held in January on private ranches in the Salmon area and on U.S. Forest Service land, which doesn't require a permit, according to a federal judge's ruling last year. But losing the 3.1 million acres of BLM land cuts the area for the derby in half. The contest includes a $1,000 prize each for whoever kills the most wolves and coyotes. Joe Kraayenbrink, the BLM's district manager in Idaho Falls who signed the decision revoking the permit, didn't return a call from The Associated Press on Wednesday. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, facing two federal lawsuits from conservation groups, canceled a permit late Tuesday issued to derby organizer Idaho for Wildlife on Nov. 13 . The two lawsuits filed by seven environmental groups contended that the agency violated environmental laws. King said the Western Environmental Law Center is not withdrawing its lawsuit because it's not clear if the BLM would conduct the needed environmental analysis should Idaho for Wildlife apply for another permit. The center is representing WildEarth Guardians, Cascadia Wildlands and the Boulder-White Clouds Council in the lawsuit that also seeks to halt the derby on Forest Service land. The groups contend environmental laws require the agency to do an environmental analysis and issue a permit. King said a court date hasn't been set but she expected one before the derby scheduled for Jan. 2-4. Four other environmental groups — Defenders of Wildlife, the Center for Biological Diversity, Western Watersheds Project and Project Coyote — are also suing the BLM, contending the permit opposes the federal government's wolf-reintroduction efforts. The two lawsuits filed by seven environmental groups contended that the agency violated environmental laws . Amy Atwood, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said the lawsuit would continue because of ambiguity in the BLM's statement. ""We think this is a serious, precedent-setting case,"" she said. Alder, the derby organizer, predicted that the permit's loss could drive more hunters to shoot the predators on BLM lands anyway, though any coyotes or wolves killed there wouldn't be eligible for prize money. 'I think you're going to see more hunters out,' he said. 'This isn't going to save one coyote from being shot, I can guarantee that.' The event last year drew 230 people, about 100 of them hunters, who killed 21 coyotes but no wolves.","The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, facing two federal lawsuits from conservation groups, canceled a permit late Tuesday issued to derby organizer Idaho for Wildlife on Nov. 13 .

"Many Christians doubt David Cameron’s sincerity in pledging to protect their freedoms, former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey says today. In an article for the Daily Mail, Lord Carey squarely accuses ministers of ‘aiding and abetting’ discrimination against Christians. He says he believes there is an ‘aggressive secularist and relativist approach’ behind the Government plans to legalise gay marriage and says the Prime Minister has ‘done more than any other recent political leader’ to ‘feed’ Christian anxieties. Questions: Many Christians doubt David Cameron’s sincerity in pledging to protect their freedoms, former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey says today . As a dramatic new poll released on the eve of Easter Sunday revealed that more than two-thirds of Christians feel they are now part of a ‘persecuted minority’, Lord Carey insists the Government must do more to demonstrate its commitment to pledges to stand up for faith. The survey suggests churchgoers increasingly feel religious freedoms are under assault from aggressive secularism. Critics say court rulings against Christians who want to wear crosses at work, and legal action preventing prayers before council meetings, have helped make people feel marginalised. Good Friday: Christian pilgrims carry the Easter Cross to a small Good Friday service at St Andrews Church in Northumberland.  More than two-thirds of Christians feel they are now part of a 'persecuted minority' In the article, Lord Carey expresses particular alarm about apparent Government support for a campaign by Labour MP Chris Bryant to turn the 700-year-old Parliamentary chapel of St Mary Undercroft into a multi-faith prayer room so that gay couples can get married there. But he also turns his fire on the Prime Minister, saying: ‘It was a bit rich to hear that the Prime Minister has told religious leaders that they should “stand up and oppose aggressive secularisation” when it seems that his government is aiding and abetting this aggression every step of the way. ‘At his pre-Easter Downing Street reception for faith leaders, he said that he supported Christians’ right to practise their faith. Yet many Christians doubt his sincerity.’ Unhappy: He expresses alarm about apparent Government support to turn the 700-year-old Parliamentary chapel of St Mary Undercroft into a multi-faith prayer room so that gay couples can get married there . The ComRes poll suggests there is continuing resentment over the Government’s decision to legalise same-sex unions, even though there is special protection for the Church of England in the law. More than half (58 per cent) of Christians who backed the Conservatives in 2010 suggested they will ‘definitely not’ vote for the party in 2015. The ComRes poll of 535 regular . churchgoers, commissioned by the Coalition for Marriage (C4M), reveals . that more than two-thirds (67 per cent) of Christians feel that they are . part of a ‘persecuted minority’. The . march of secularism means that if trends continue, Britain will no . longer be a Christian country by 2030 when the number of non-believers . will have overtaken the number of Christians. In . the past six years the number of Muslims has surged by 37 per cent to . 2.6million, Hindus by 43 per cent and Buddhists by a massive 74 per . cent. Numbers who . choose to call themselves Christians fell by more than 4million in a . decade after 2001, the 2011 census showed. Fewer than six out of ten – . 59.3 per cent – described themselves as Christian. A decade ago nearly three quarters, 72 per cent, did so. Some 33.2million people said they were Christian in 2011. Downing . Street strongly rejected Lord Carey’s attack. A spokesman said: ‘This . government strongly backs faith and Christianity in particular, . including backing the rights of people wanting to wear crosses at work . and hold prayers at council meetings.

"Julian Fellowes is fighting to stop a tiny hamlet which inspired Thomas Hardy's most famous books from being 'obliterated' by a housing estate. Hardy wrote Far From the Madding Crowd in his parents' cottage near Lower Bockhampton, Dorset - which is also where he went to school and saw a milkmaid who inspired Tess of the D'Urbervilles. Now an agricultural college has lodged plans to build 70 new houses in the tiny settlement, which currently has just 28 homes. Maddened crowd: Villagers (pictured) are protesting plans by an agricultural college to more than treble the size of Lower Bockhampton, Dorset, where Thomas Hardy went to school and which inspired his novels . Picturesque: Hardy grew up in this thatched cottage a mile from the threatened Dorset village of Lower Bockhampton, and it was here that he wrote his famous novel Far From the Madding Crowd in 1874 . Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes (left) is leading the fight and said the houses would be like an 'atom bomb'. Right: Christopher Vulliamy, who lives in Hardy's old school, said the proposal is 'bonkers' Downton Abbey creator Lord Fellowes, who is the president of the Hardy Society and lives a mile away in West Stafford, said the rolling hills immortalised in Hardy's books would be ruined. 'The residents of Lower Bockhampton are about to be hit with an atom bomb,' he said. 'This development will obliterate the village. 'This is a hamlet of 28 houses which will almost quadruple in size in one go, having been the same size for hundreds of years. 'Five to ten houses could be absorbed by the village but 70 is a sledgehammer blow. 'People from around the world come to visit to see where Hardy lived and where he wrote and the places that inspired him. One cannot understate how much the local area inspired Hardy.' Pilgrimage: The Victorian novelist walked every day down this lane from his cottage home to Lower Bockhampton, and it inspired the idyllic country atmosphere of the fictionalised county Wessex in his novels . Outrage: Villagers are campaigning against the development, which would more than treble the hamlet's size . Plans: The site of the proposed development and Hardy's cottage, near the town of Dorchester in Dorset . Nestled among history: The planned housing (in red) is a stone's throw from Hardy's old school (purple) Rolling hills: A satellite image of the same site handed to the council. The college is on the far left in yellow . He added: 'We have a real responsibility to protect the environment of one of England's greatest global writers. 'Can you imagine plans to build almost 100 houses at Chawton (Jane Austen's home) or Haworth (the home of the Bronte sisters)?' The housing plans - which have also been slammed by English Heritage and the Open Spaces Society - have been put forward by the Kingston Maurwood agricultural college, which owns the land. The college's bosses say selling the plot for housing is the only way it can raise enough money to expand and redevelop. Outline plans are being considered by West Dorset District Council and have attracted more than 50 objections. Born in nearby Higher Bockhampton in 1840, Thomas Hardy grew up in his parents' thatched cottage a mile from the village currently under threat. Lord Fellowes said: 'The residents of Lower Bockhampton are about to be hit with an atom bomb' Idyll: The plans for the 28-home hamlet prompted anger from English Heritage and the Open Spaces Society . Pretty: Hardy's Wessex was shaped by his years spent in the picturesque Dorset village in the mid-1880s . It was there that he wrote Far From the Madding Crowd, which proved to be his first major literary success when it was published in 1874. The cottage is now run by English Heritage, and is far from the only mark Hardy left on the landscape. The beautiful countryside of Dorset was repeatedly immortalised in his novels as the fictional county of Wessex, whose idyllic rural perfection became the focus of years of literary criticism. He was inspired by regular walks down the tree-lined lane to Lower Bockhampton, where he went to school in a building which still exists as a private home - together with the Victorian school bell. Lower Bockhampton itself became the fictional village of Melstock in Hardy's 1872 novel Under the Greenwood Tree, which depicted romantic tanglings in tight-knit village life. Homespun: The protests began on a small scale, but have extended beyond the tiny village . Published anonymously, it focused on a new schoolmistress named Fancy Day who arrives in 'Melstock' and attracts a number of suitors to the school house where she lives. In 2005 the BBC produced an adaptation of the novel starring Keeley Hawes. It was later in life that Hardy saw an 18-year-old milkmaid in Lower Bockhampton - and she became the inspiration for the central character of his 1892 masterpiece Tess of the D'Urbervilles. Neighbouring Dorchester also became the town of the title in Hardy's 1886 work The Mayor of Casterbridge. Along with Higher Bockampton - Hardy's birthplace - and nearby Stinsford, historians say the three villages act as a 'pilgrimage route' for fans of the writer. Hardy's heart was removed before he was cremated and buried in Stinsford - while the rest of his ashes were interred in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. Kate Ashbrook, the chairman of the Open Spaces Society, said: 'Thomas Hardy would turn in his grave at the prospect of this massive development in his native hamlet. The peace and quiet of this lovely area would be ruined. 'This is of course a popular tourist destination because of its association with Hardy and it would be an outrage if the council were to allow such alien and overpowering development.' Retired paediatrician Dr Christopher Vulliamy has lived in Hardy's former school house - just 30 yards from the proposed houses - since 1962. He said: 'The peaceful and rural setting of the school house, which so many Hardy fans pause to look at from the river path that Hardy used to walk, will be blighted by this. 'Seventy houses is disproportionately large for a hamlet that has only 30 houses. This development would overwhelm Lower Bockhampton.' Clare Davison, the principal of Kingston Maurwood College, said: 'We want to provide additional state of the art agri-tech facilities and expand our Higher Education offer enabling more students to study degree programmes on their doorstep. 'The capital released from the sale of land will enable the college to embark on a programme of redevelopment and will have a positive impact on meeting local housing needs.' The plans are by the Kingston Maurwood agricultural college (above), which is selling the land to raise money . The principal of the college (above) said it was the only way to ensure it could compete in the modern world . Born in 1840, Thomas Hardy is now one of the most celebrated novelists and poets in English history - not least because of his descriptions of rural Dorset life. He immortalised the county where he grew up as 'Wessex', setting all of his major novels in the somewhat idealised, fictionalised world. To him as to many Romantic and Victorian authors, the countryside represented a more pristine life than the grunting machinery which heralded the Industrial Revolution, but also one more closely entwined with mankind's animalistic desires. Celebrated: Thomas Hardy created a pastoral picture of the rural England in which he grew up . Wessex was first used in Far From the Madding Crowd, which told the story of an independent-minded young woman who refuses to marry humble shepherd Gabriel Oak. The girl, Bathsheba Everdene, comes into money and moves away - but is forced to seek Gabriel's help when her sheep begin dying. A long and complex friendship follows, and slowly Bathsheba realises the friendship of her youth - not the temptations of the wider world - is the key to her happiness. Gabriel asks her to marry him a second time and she accepts. Wessex was also used in Hardy's 1892 masterwork Tess of the d'Urbervilles - whose original subtitle was A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented. She is the daughter of a poor family which is corrupted at the beginning of the novel by a rumour that she is descended from nobility. But when she goes to meet the libertine Alec D'Urberville, instead of inheriting his family's estate she starts working on it - before being raped by Alec in a symbolic, and real, loss of innocence. As her life unravels it does so in that same country setting, and after she finally stabs Alec to death it is to Stonehenge that she walks to await her fate. Wessex itself was named after the Medieval English kingdom which took in much of the south west, but its borders were not the same and changed from novel to novel. In reality it was a poor area which changed little in hundreds of years and was blighted by a devastating death rate in sickness and childbirth' Hardy turned away from novels in the 1890s after Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure received mixed reviews, and began writing poetry instead. He died in 1928 and his ashes were interred in Poets' Corner at Westminster Abbey.","Agricultural college lodged plans for 70 new houses in 28-home hamlet .

"One of Australia's most iconic animals sought a change of scenery from it's usual leafy gumtree hideout, taking a casual stroll along the sandy beaches of Queensland's Magnetic Island. One curious koala was spotted by a surprised tourist clambering down from a tree and exploring the shoreline of the island. The footage shows the inquisitive creature as it caught some ocean views, calmly edging it's way to the water before stopping to look at the waves lapping the sand, seemingly transfixed by the motion. Scroll down for video . One curious koala was spotted by a surprised tourist clambering down from a tree and exploring the shoreline of the island . The inquisitive creatures caught some ocean views, calmly edging it's way to the water before stopping to look at the waves lapping the sand, seemingly transfixed by the motion . Magnetic Island is well known for it's koala population, with the species numbers growing in past years to 600 . The koala appeared to be in no hurry to leave, and was not startled by the audience it has gathered who were watching it's antics. Trent Cowan, 30, works at the island's backpacker accommodation and said that reports of koalas wandering down onto the beach, or even through the bar where he serves, is quite commonplace on the island. 'It's pretty normal for them to wander through the hostel,' Mr Cowan said. 'They don't seem to be that bothered, they just continue on their way, doing what they're doing, being lazy and chilled out,' he said. Tourists staying on the island are usually pretty excited when one wanders though, and Mr Cowan said that some will even take selfies with the inquisitive creatures. 'The paparazzi definitely comes out. People get pretty excited, because many haven't seen one in the wild before,' he said. 'They don't want to be touched or picked up, but they do sometimes just wander through reception.' Mr Cowan only recently caught a koala which had an injury to it's eye, after several reports of koala sightings came in over the space of one weekend. 'It looked like it was blind, and it's still in care,' he said. The koala appeared to be in no hurry to leave, and was not startled by the audience it has gathered who were watching it's antics . Professor Krockenberger and his team have been studying the population of koalas on the island and have said that the number is very healthy . Koalas are often spotted among the nearby habitats of eucalypt forest, with the rest of the island comprising of wetlands, mangroves and coastal dunes . James Cook University's Professor Andrew Krockenberger said  that 'It is not normal, we don't see that very often, however it is not so abnormal that I've never heard of this before. Koalas found in islands of the Noosa River are known to even swim between islands,' said . 'Any time that a koala is not in a gumtree eating leaves people think it needs to be rescued, because it is somehow in trouble. They are interested, they see something a little bit different and they go to have a look,' he told The ABC. 'They have come down from trees close to the rocks where people are fishing, had a bit of a look at them and then wandered off up to another tree,' 'So it is clearly within their behavioural repertoire to indulge in this sort of activity every now and then, but every time it does happen people are quite surprised by it,' he said. Magnetic Island is well known for it's koala population, with the species numbers growing in past years to 600. Koalas first appeared on the island during the 20th century, and were not a native species to the island when Europeans first landed in the area. Professor Krockenberger and his team have been studying the population of koalas on the island and have said that the number is very healthy, reported The ABC. 'In around the 1920s and 1930s there was a lot of concern about koalas and there was a bit of an Australia-wide push to conserve koalas,' said Professor Krockenberger. 'People also started to make little sanctuaries for them and bring them to different islands and Magnetic Island was one of those islands,' he said. Female koalas on the island have one baby each year, according to the research done by Prof. Krockenberger and his team. Koalas are often spotted among the nearby habitats of eucalypt forest, with the rest of the island comprising of wetlands, mangroves and coastal dunes.","The inquisitive creature was captured clambering down a tree and calmly crawling over the beach to the shoreline .

"A 13-month old baby girl has died after suffering a suspected cardiac arrest while at nursery in Edinburgh, it has been reported. Staff at Careshare's Port Hamilton nursery in the city found the child had stopped breathing and she was rushed to hospital yesterday morning, and despite efforts medics failed to resuscitate her. The private nursery, in the Tollcross area of the city, was closed today to allow police to carry out a 'thorough investigation' into the tragic circumstances. A 13-month-old baby girl was rushed to hospital yesterday after she suffered a suspected cardiac arrest while at Careshare's Port Hamilton nursery in Edinburgh and later died . It is understood the girl, who was taken to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, had a medical condition there were not thought to be any suspicious circumstances, according to the BBC. The child's devastated family, who have not been identified, are being comforted following her sudden death. The Careshare Day Nursery is part of Busy Bees Nurseries - the UK’s largest childcare nursery provider - with 237 children’s nurseries nationwide. In a statement, the company said: ‘It is with great sadness that we confirm the death of a child attending our Port Hamilton nursery. ‘The 13 month-old-girl was found by one of our staff to have stopped breathing. ‘An ambulance was called immediately and the child was taken to Edinburgh’s Royal Hospital for Sick Children but despite the best efforts of medical staff she could not be revived.’ Marg Randles, managing director at Busy Bees, said: 'Our thoughts and sincere condolences are with the family at this very sad time.

One mother whose son attends the nursery said: ‘It is a tragedy.’ Claire Paget, whose four-and-a-half-year-old daughter Sieanne has been attending the nursery for three years, said staff had called all parents to ask them to collect their children as a child had died. She added: ‘I rushed over as soon as I could. When I got there I was told staff who went to check on the baby found she was not breathing.’ Last night, three police cars were parked near the nursery, which shares its building with Scottish Widows at their city headquarters in Morrison Street.. Busy Bees has 17 nurseries across Scotland - including three in Edinburgh, at Edinburgh Park, Port Hamilton and Newhaven. A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'Police in Edinburgh responded to an address in Morrison Street at around 12.10pm on Wednesday following a report of a 13-month-old female child having taken unwell within. 'The infant was taken to the Sick Kids Hospital where she later passed away. 'Enquiries into the full circumstances surrounding this incident are ongoing and a report has been sent to the Procurator Fiscal.'

"A teenager nicknamed 'Baldy' by bullies was left with unsightly bald patches at the back of her head, the result of a compelling but rare disorder. May Brown, from Great Yarmouth in Norfolk began pulling her own hair out at the age of 11. By the time she was 16 she had several bald patches on the top of her head. For years, the now 17-year-old tried to hide her disorder. She endured cruel taunts and bullying from classmates - who tugged at her hair and called her 'Baldy'. She is now speaking out to raise awareness of the rare condition trichotillomania, which compels her to tear out her hair. May Brown, 17, was left bald at the top of her head due to suffering trichotillomania, which caused her to pull out her own hair compulsively . She began pulling out her hair at age 11. By the age of 16 she had a bald patches on her crown (pictured left and right) and was taunted by bullies that called her 'Baldy' She hid her condition from everyone but her family for years, hiding her bald patches with hairclips, different hairstyles and hats . The rare disorder causes people to pull their hair out from their heads, as well as from their eyebrows and eyelashes. May, a student who documented her struggle in a YouTube video, said: 'I've had enough of keeping my trichotillomania a secret for so many years and felt it was time to come clean. 'At school, I was teased for my bald patches and was an easy target for bullies. I hope speaking out raises more awareness about the condition so that others 'trichers' don't suffer in silence.' May's symptoms first became apparent when she was just 9-years-old and began pulling her eyebrow hair out. She said: 'I was watching TV one day and was constantly pulling my eyebrow hair out, not realizing what the outcome would turn out like. 'When I later looked in the mirror, I had actually pulled so much out that I had no eyebrows left.' May's trichotillomania briefly stopped until she started secondary school, when she began tearing hair from her scalp. She said: 'I somehow stopped pulling up until I was 11-years-old and then began to tear hair from my head. Trichotillomania is a condition where a person feels compelled to pull their hair out. They may pull out the hair on their head or in other places, such as their eyebrows or eyelashes. Trichotillomania is an impulse-control disorder - a psychological condition where you are unable to stop yourself carrying out a particular action. It is not known what causes trichotillomania but there are several theories. Some experts think hair pulling is a type of addiction. The more you pull your hair out, the more you want to keep doing it. Trichotillomania may be a reflection of a mental health problem. Psychological and behavioural theories suggest that hair pulling may be a way of relieving stress or anxiety. In some cases, trichotillomania may be a form of self-harm, where you deliberately injure yourself as a way of seeking temporary relief from emotional distress. The most effective treatment is therapy to change your hair-pulling behaviour, combined with a network of emotional support. Visit your GP if you are pulling your hair out or if you notice that your child is. Source: NHS Choices . 'I used to pull during school lessons - classmates would snigger and make comments. 'Because of this, I somehow stopped myself from pulling my hair in public to not bring attention to myself. 'But I would still pull in private so that within a couple of years, I had no hair left on the top of my head. 'Anything can set my trichotillomania off - from a school essay I'm stressed about it or if I over-think during a sleepless night. A lot of the time I don't even realise I'm pulling.' The state of her hair made her an easy target for school bullies. She said: 'I was called 'Baldy' by classmates. I had many comments from bullies like ""Haircut go wrong?"" or sarcastic remarks such as ""I really like your hair"". 'I remember one point a bully tugged my hair so that they could fully see my bald patch and have the chance to mock me.' May attempted to conceal her bald patches with different hair accessories and styles. She said: 'I would wear hearbands, hair slides and hats to hide my baldness. 'I remember I used to get told off in school for always wearing the same hat. Some of my teachers were fed up with me for wearing it so much.' Until this year, May was too embarrassed to reveal her condition to her friends and family. It was only her sister and parents who were aware of her trichotillomania. But in January, the Youtube blogger - who runs the channel MayBrown21 - decided to upload a video in which she confessed to the world. The inspiring teen said: 'I decided to make a YouTube video explaining that I have trichotillomania as I wanted to tell my secret to everybody I knew. 'It was sort of a New Year's Resolution to not hide in silence anymore. She chronicled her experiences on Youtube. In January, she released a video on Youtube confessing to having the condition. She says she has received messages of support since . 'Since uploading the video, I have had so much support from everyone. I'm always receiving messages from other sufferers around the world asking for advice and telling me their Trich stories,' she said . 'Even though it was literally the hardest thing I had ever done, I thought it would be much easier to upload one video than tell people face-to-face. 'But since uploading the video, I have had so much support from everyone. I'm always receiving messages from other sufferers around the world asking for advice and telling me their trich stories.' A spokesman for Trichotillomania Support, a resource for people with the disorder, said: 'Trichotillomania can often affect shy people who are afraid or nervous to ask for help. 'It is important that sufferers know they are not alone and they should not be ashamed of asking for support. 'Any individual with the condition can call the Trichotillomania Support helpline. 'Athough it is often only in exceptional cases that people are able to stop pulling their hair altogether, there are ways in which you can learn to manage your Trichotillomania.'

"Just hours after Phillip Hughes succumbed to the most freakish of sports injuries, it was revealed he had earned himself his cherished Test recall. The poignant news was revealed by Test selector Mark Waugh, just hours after Hughes died on Thursday afternoon at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney. If a 135kmh bouncer hadn't cannoned into the side of his neck at the SCG on Tuesday, Hughes would be preparing to don the baggy green cap for the 27th time, playing against India at the Gabba in a week's time. Test selector Mark Waugh (pictured) admitted the left-hander was poised to replace injured captain Michael Clarke in the first Test line-up . The poignant news was revealed by Test selector Mark Waugh, just hours after Hughes died on Thursday afternoon of vertebral artery dissection . In a bewildering mix of tragedy and bizarre timing, Test selector Mark Waugh - who watched Hughes make an untroubled 63 before he fatefully mistimed a pull shot two days ago - admitted the left-hander was poised to replace injured captain Michael Clarke in the first Test line-up. 'It makes it an even tougher pill to swallow,' Waugh told Fox Sports. Just 25, Hughes died on Thursday afternoon in St Vincent's Hospital of vertebral artery dissection, an extremely rare medical problem in which the artery to the brain is torn. It's only been reported 100 times, just once before in cricket and St Vincent's had never seen a case. Hughes - Australia's 408th Test player - was one of the most likeable cricketers across the country. Renowned as a fighter since marking his debut Test series with sensational success as a 20-year-old against South Africa in 2009, Hughes had been vying for a fourth recall to the Australian side. Hughes would be preparing to don the baggy green cap for the 27th time, playing against India at the Gabba in a week . Hughes had been vying for a fourth recall to the Australian side, which it is now known he achieved . Australian Cricketers Association chief executive Alistair Nicholson described the gritty batsman in a nutshell. 'Phillip Hughes died playing the sport that he loved amongst those who loved him,' Nicholson said. 'His final shot typified his approach to the game - aggressive, positive and defiant.' Tears flowed as Test and interstate teammates, as well as former captain Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh, gathered at St Vincent's throughout Thursday to say their final farewell - ending a two-day bedside vigil after he was placed in an induced coma. Great mate David Warner was inconsolable, while Clarke - described as a big brother to the batsman - was singled out for his great love and care for his friend, and support to his grief-stricken family. 'The family was obviously going through a difficult time but I'm not sure they would have coped without Michael's assistance,' said Australian team doctor Peter Brukner. Hughes speaks at a press conference at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Sydney. He was one of the most likeable cricketers across the country. Cricketer Dave Warner his partner Candice Falzon and Matthew Wade and his partner leave St. Vincents Hospital in Sydney . Hughes was one of the most likeable cricketers across the country . Early Thursday evening, Hughes' parents and sister were joined by several players, including Warner, Ponting, Peter Siddle, James Pattinson and Aaron Finch, at the SCG. His mother Virginia was inconsolable as she left. Flowers, Australian and Barmy Army flags, as well as a cricket ball and bat have been laid outside the nearby Cricket NSW offices. News of Hughes' death brought tributes from around the world with cricket luminaries like Ian Botham and Sachin Tendulkar joining Prime Minister Tony Abbott offering condolences. Play in the Test match between New Zealand and Pakistan in Sharjah was called off for the day while the flags at Lord's - the home of cricket - flew at half-mast. Cricket Australia chief James Sutherland said tragedy was a word uttered too often in sport, but this was real life tragedy. 'Phil has been taken away from us to soon,' Sutherland said. 'It's an understatement to say we're completely devastated. 'The impact of Phillip's loss is enormous.' With questions now hovering over staging the Gabba Test, Sutherland said it was too early to consider calling the game off.","Phillip Hughes died on Thursday afternoon of vertebral artery dissection .

Taney Dragons' Mo'ne Davis pitches to a Nevada batter during a Little League World Series game at Lamade Stadium on August 20 in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania . They claim two players were tossing the ball when it hit Mr Kumar in the eye, leaving him with long-term physical and emotional damage. The couple say the association should not have allowed players to practice near the stands. The lawsuit states the incident occurred during a 'game of toss and catch' between two boys who who were practising outside the fence and 'negligently close' to the stands. The Philadelphia Daily News first reported the lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the incident left Mr Kumar 'disabled and disordered'. His injuries included a corneal abrasion, a 'deformed pupil,' double vision and 'multiple torn sphincter muscles'.

"Jihadi fighters in the Middle East are claiming benefits in the UK to fund terror, police chiefs have revealed. Scotland Yard counter-terror officer Terri Nicholson revealed terrorists fighting for ISIS in Iraq and Syria were fraudulently claiming taxpayers’ money to fund attacks abroad. She revealed there had been ‘a number of cases’ of terrorists making student loan claims to fund their activities. Mohommod Hassin Nawaz, 31, and Hamza Nawaz, 23,  have been jailed for conspiracy to attend a place used for terrorist training after returning from Syria . The revelation sparked fury among MPs today. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, said the prospect of benefits being used to fund overseas terror was ‘shocking’. Mr Vaz said: ‘It is shocking that this is happening. We need to see assurances from government that the integrity of the student loan and benefits system has not been compromised, with the full cooperation of the banking network.’ It comes as two brothers from east London became the first Britons to be jailed for fighting in Syria, having gone to a training camp in the country. Another jihadist, who skipped bail to fight in Syria, used Twitter to mock the lapse in security that allowed him to flee. Miss Nicholson, a Met Assistant Commander, told the Telegraph that terrorists were using ‘innovative’ techniques to rip off the taxpayer. She said: ‘We are seeing a diverse fraud, including substantial fraud online, abuse of the benefits system, abuse of student loans, in order to fund terrorism.’ Philip Davies, the Tory MP, added: ‘I know the Government has been cracking down on benefit fraud. It seems to me that this shows that if anything, they need to go further.’ He added: ‘It is sickening to think that [UK money is funding terror plots] but whenever there is any money being doled out, it’s obvious that terrorists will be trying to get their hands on as much of it as possible.’ Conservative Home Secretary Theresa May unveiled sweeping new anti-terror powers in Parliament yesterday . Labour chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee Keith Vaz said the revelation that benefits were being used to fund terror were 'shocking' A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ‘No one should doubt our commitment to rooting out benefit fraud.’ Miss Nicholson also revealed that women were being used to smuggle thousands of pounds in cash out of Britain to fund terrorists abroad. Earlier this month, Amal El Wahabi, a British mother-of-two, was jailed for more than two years for trying to arrange to smuggle £16,000 to her jihadist husband fighting in Syria. She misled her friend, Nawal Msaad, into carrying the cash in her underwear.","Scotland Yard counter-terror chief Terri Nicholson reveals 'shocking' fraud .

"Nigel Farage is facing defeat in his bid to enter Parliament next year, a new poll has revealed . Ukip leader Nigel Farage is facing defeat in his bid to become an MP  in next year's general election, a new poll has suggested. The survey, carried out for former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft, found that Mr Farage is trailing the Conservatives by five points in Thanet South - on 29 per cent, to 34 per cent for David Cameron's party and 26 per cent for Labour. A similar survey in July gave him a four-point lead in the Kent constituency. The same poll suggests Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg faces a tough fight to hold onto his Sheffield Hallam seat, with a narrow advantage of just three points over Labour. Just 31 per cent of voters in Mr Clegg's constituency told pollsters they will back Mr Clegg in May. At the 2010 general election the Lib Dem lead held his seat with 53 per cent of the vote. But the poll bolstered Mr Clegg's hopes of hanging onto a sizeable number of MPs in the 2015 election, suggesting that many sitting Liberal Democrats are 'entrenched' in their constituencies and could save their seats by outstripping the party's national performance. Ed Miliband's 26-point general election lead in Doncaster North, meanwhile, has been squeezed to 12 points, and the poll suggested he could be vulnerable to tactical voting. The combined total of Ukip and Tory supporters - making up just over half the electorate in Mr Miliband's constituency - top the 40 per cent who said they will vote Labour. In a further blow for the Labour leader just 35 per cent in his South Yorkshire constituency said they would rather have Mr Miliband than Mr Cameron as PM. But when asked to choose their favourite PM from the four main party leaders, almost a quarter (24 per cent) of Mr Miliband's constituents plumped for him, compared to 23 per cent who picked Mr Cameron. Mr Clegg claimed that Lib Dems will retain most of their 56 MPs in next year's election despite dismal opinion poll ratings, which have put them as low as 6 per cent nationally, and their recent lost deposit in the Rochester by-election, where they finished fifth behind the Greens. 'Ukip have got two MPs, the Greens have got one. We have got 56 and we will retain the vast, vast majority of those,' the Lib Dem leader told LBC radio. 'I really do think when people come to put the cross on the ballot paper they will say 'Who's done stuff for me and my family?'. 'On that, we are going to be very proud and we are going to stick our logo on our leaflets and say 'We did it'.' Nick Clegg could lose his seat to the Labour party in May next year, a poll by the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft has shown . The Ashcroft poll, which focused on marginal Lib Dem seats as well as party leaders' constituencies, appeared to give some backing to Mr Clegg's analysis. Of 11 key marginals where Lib Dems are under challenge from Conservatives, the poll suggested Mr Clegg's party would hold onto nine - including Energy Secretary Ed Davey's Kingston & Surbiton, Brecon & Radnor, Carshalton & Wallington, Cheltenham, Colchester, Hazel Grove, Lewes, Southport and Thornbury & Yate - while losing North Devon and Portsmouth South, where MP Mike Hancock is sitting as an independent. Labour was primed to win back Burnley, but would fail in its attempt to gain Birmingham Yardley from the Lib Dems, the poll suggested.","Mr Farage is trailing the Conservatives by five points in Thanet South .

"Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe was said to be close to death tonight. The 88-year-old, who is believed to be suffering from prostate cancer, flew to Singapore by private jet on Saturday for treatment. His wife, Grace, and close family members are reported to be at his bedside. Vigil: Robert Mugabe's family are with him as the Zimbabwean leader, who is said to be close to death, battles cancer in a Singapore hospital . The tyrant has undergone several bouts of therapy in Asia in recent years. But his condition has now . deteriorated and there were claims tonight that he has agreed to hand . over power to his feared henchman and defence minister, Emmerson . Mnangagwa. Rumours over Mugabe’s health have . been rife in recent weeks because of his frail appearance. There was . heightened speculation today when the Zimbabwe government postponed a . cabinet meeting at the last minute. The Zimbabwe Mail, quoting a senior . official of Mugabe’s ZANU-PF party, said the leader, who has ruled the . country since its independence from Britain in 1980, was undergoing . intensive treatment in Asia. Mugabe was  supposedly in Singapore to oversee his daughter Bona’s enrolment at university. But registration does not start until . September and opponents said it was unlikely he would travel abroad to . deal with such a matter in person. Sources in Iran, which has a warm relationship with Zimbabwe, said Mugabe had agreed on his successor. The Tehran Times said the tyrant had . entered into a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ to hand over power to 65-year-old . Mnangagwa, who helped orchestrate the violent opposition to Britain in . the 1970s. Aging: The dictator celebrates his 88th birthday in February this year . The former Zimbabwe intelligence . chief was also widely blamed for the brutality following the 2008 . presidential election after Mugabe’s rival, Morgan Tsvangirai, took an . early lead in the voting. He is also thought to have played a . major role in the crackdown of the opposition Zapu party in the 1980s . that left thousands of civilians dead. There was no comment on Mugabe’s . health tonight from either his family or from the Zimbabwe . government.Mugabe’s aides have denied there is a medical emergency, . claiming he is enjoying an Easter break in Asia with his family. But Zimbabwe’s vice president, Joice . Mujuru, has reportedly cut short her trip to Asia to return home and . prepare for the possibility of Mugabe’s death. The tyrant is understood to have . travelled to Singapore eight times last year for medical treatment. A . diplomatic cable released last year by Wikileaks said Mugabe was . diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2008 and given five years to live . because it had spread. He is said to have defied pleas from his own doctors to step down. Taking over? It's been reported that Mugabe entered into a 'gentleman's agreement' to hand over power to Emmerson Mnangagwa . His ailing health has been cited as . the main reason that a hard line faction of his ZANU-PF party has pushed . to rush through new elections. The Zimbabwe Mail quoted a . British-based Zimbabwe analyst, who wished to remain anonymous, as . saying: ‘Mugabe’s health impacts entirely on Zimbabwe’s political . landscape. Everything revolves around his health and his age.’ In February, Mugabe declared himself . ‘fit as a fiddle’. Last month he celebrated his 88th birthday with a . lavish party in the capital, Harare, reputed to have cost £650,000. The leader was said to have feasted on a cake in the shape of a crocodile. Mugabe was hailed as a hero by many . Africans when he came to power 32 years ago with Zimbabwe looked on as a . model for a successful transition from white rule. But the nation’s fortunes have plunged together with Mugabe’s reputation. He is now regarded as one of the . world’s worst human rights abusers. He has been accused of murdering . thousands of his own citizens and brutally crushing all opposition to . his rule. His policies have also been blamed for driving Zimbabwe into bankruptcy. Mugabe’s land reforms in particular, leading to violent seizures from . white farmers, have been harshly criticised by the British and American . governments.","Zimbabwean tyrant 'close to death'

"The overjoyed parents of twin girls in India who survived a complex operation to separate them after they were born joined at the liver are now desperate to take their healthy daughters home. The two-month-old girls, Saboora and Safoora, beat incredible odds of one-in-50million of surviving such a procedure. They were joined at the abdomen and had shared a liver since birth, called Omphalopagus. But a team of 40, from Medanta – The Medicity Hospital, in Haryana, northern India, performed the rare feat over six hours, on November 15, which involved separating the liver. Conjoined twins Saboora and Safoora were joined at the abdomen and shared a common liver since birth .

Zabeeda, who already has a three-year-old boy, said: 'I am overjoyed the surgery has gone well. It was my only wish to have my two beautiful daughters healthy and my wish has been granted.' Zabeeda knew she was pregnant with twins but they had not been diagnosed as conjoined until they were born. She said: 'If the doctors had informed us earlier we would have made arrangements to separate the girls at birth but we had no idea. 'It was very difficult for us to take proper care of them when they were born. A doctor shows the abdominal stitches of baby Safoora at Medanta Medicity hospital today .

Dr Neelam Mohan, Director of the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Liver Transplantation, at Medanta – The Medicity Hospital, said: 'The surgery has been a success. We had a team of 30 staff and eight were at the operating table working on the girls. 'The biggest challenge was separating the livers where the blood vessels were joined which increased the risk of severe bleeding. 'There was also a danger the livers wouldn't function again in the future.

Dr Mohan added: 'Conjoined twins, in most cases, have failed to survive so the entire team was anxious but we have succeeded. 'There should be no complications for these babies now. They should go on to live a healthy life.'

"The billionaire founder of Foxtons is suing a London garage after his rare £1million Lamborghini blew up while his son was driving it. Property tycoon Jon Hunt claims that the wrong type of spark plugs was fitted when his Lamborghini Miura SV was serviced by the garage last year. His son had driven less than a mile from the Lamborghini London garage when he noticed white smoke coming from the engine. Just minutes later, the 1971 car burst into flames. Scroll down for video . On fire: The Lamborghini Miura SV burst into flames less than a mile from the luxury car garage in Acton. Mr Hunt claims that the wrong type of spark plug was fitted when the 1971 supercar was serviced last April . Fireball: The dramatic moment was captured on camera and posted to YouTube. Mr Hunt's son was not injured in the incident but the vehicle was reducted to a charred shell on the A40 in Acton . Mr Hunt's son, who is not named in the claim, was not injured, but the vehicle, considered the world's first supercar, was reduced to a charred shell on the A40 in Acton. The dramatic moment was captured on camera by car enthusiasts who uploaded the video to YouTube. Now Mr Hunt, 61, whose wealth was valued at more than £1billion by the Times Rich List this year, is suing luxury car specialists, H.R. Owen Dealerships Ltd, who handled the work. He is claiming £700,000 in compensation for the destroyed supercar, plus damages for storage and 'loss of enjoyment' of the vehicle. The garage is well-known car dealer to the rich and famous. When Lamborghini's flagship car was launched in 1966, the Miura generated much publicity as the world's fastest road car. Only 764 have ever been built. It is formed part of Mr Hunt's extensive collection of supercars - which also includes vintage Ferraris. In a claim lodged at London's High Court, Daniel Scarrott, for Mr Hunt, said that H.R Owen, 'held itself out as having particular expertise in the repair and servicing of Lamborghini motor vehicles.' Wreckage: Mr Hunt, whose wealth was valued at more than £1billion by the Times Rich List this year, is claiming £700,000 in compensation, plus damages for storage and 'loss of enjoyment' of the vehicle . 'The defendant agreed to inspect, assess and service the vehicle' the claim states, adding that H.R Owen owed Mr Hunt 'a duty of care to exercise the reasonable care and skill of an expert Lamborghini repairer and service.' Mr Scarrott continues: 'On December 19th 2012 Mr Hunt delivered the vehicle to the defendant's garage on School Road, North Acton. 'The defendant thereafter purported to perform the services and in particular carried out a service of the vehicle and replaced the engine oil, filter and spark plugs. Car enthusiast: Mr Hunt, who founded estate agents Foxtons, built a garage under his Kensington home where he stores his collection of vintage Ferraris . 'The defendant notified Mr Hunt that the services had been completed and the vehicle was ready for collection. 'On 5th April 2013 Mr Hunt, by his son, attended the garage to collect the vehicle. 'Mr Hunt's son was then provided with the keys to the vehicle... he then proceeded to drive into London along the A40. 'As the vehicle proceeded along the A40, the vehicle did not appear to be running smoothly... within less than one mile of the garage, the vehicle's engine gave off a puff of white smoke'. Mr Scarrott says that, at this stage, Mr Hunt's son pulled over and was advised by a garage employee who was nearby in another vehicle to drive the car back to the garage. 'Mr Hunt's son then proceeded to drive off with a view to returning to the garage. As he did so he noticed a smell of an old car and a further wisp of white smoke and an unexpected noise. 'There was then a deep percussion noise and the engine of the vehicle caught fire. In that fire the vehicle was substantially damaged. The lawyer goes on to allege that mechanics at the garage had put in the wrong type of spark plugs when they serviced the car. He claimed: 'The spark plugs fitted worked at too high a temperature and created the risk of fire. 'The fire was caused by the ignition of fuel. Such ignition could not have taken place unless the fuel system was not intact or the spark plugs were not properly adjusted or fitted. 'Both of these matters could have been avoided by a competent service of the vehicle.' Mr Scarrott also puts forward an alternative case that the fire was caused by the engine's timing being out and its carburettor not being properly adjusted. The claim states that Mr Hunt is claiming for the loss of the £900,000 car, but agrees to offset the £200,000 salvage value it has even as a burnt out shell. He is also claiming additional damages for loss of use of the car and storage costs. At Mr Hunt's mansion in Kensington Palace Gardens, there is an underground museum specially designed to house his collection of vintage Ferraris. Classic car: The Lamborghini Miura generated much publicity as the world's fastest road car when it was launched. Only 764 of the 1971 SV model have ever been built. (Above, file image of a Lamborghini Miura SV) And in 2012 he sold a 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO for a reputed £20.2million - at the time Britain's most expensive car. The billionaire made his fortune when he sold Foxtons, a company he founded in a former pasta restaurant in London's Notting Hill, for £360million to a private equity firm in 2007. Since leaving the firm he has managed to almost triple the cash he received for the sale by investing in property – leaving him with an estimated fortune of £925million. He also owns a  Suffolk estate, Heveningham Hall, near his childhood home. It is an 18th century Grade I listed Palladian country house with 25 bedrooms, 19 bathrooms, 12 receptions, set in 460 acres. H.R Owen's defence was not available from the court and the contents of the claim have yet to be tested in evidence before a judge. A spokeswoman for H.R Owen told the Evening Standard: 'This is a case between two insurance companies, but H.R Owen continue to do business with Jon Hunt.' The company has been contacted by MailOnline for comment.","Lamborghini Miura SV caught fire less than a mile from London garage .

"A British wine merchant has created the world's first insect and wine matching guide. As well as pairing Chardonnay to tarantulas, buyers at Laithwaite's Wine matched sparkling rose to barbecued locusts, sherry to giant waterbugs and Shiraz to sago worms. Traditional food in parts of Asia, Latin America and Africa, edible insects are now being touted as the new superfood due to their high protein content. Buyers at Laithwaite's Wine have created the world's first insect and wine matching guide . It's a pairing game: Ten of of Laithwaite's 1,500 wines were matched to popular edible insects . The buyers at the wine merchants paired ten of Laithwaite's 1,500 wines to popular bugs. 'We did our research on it and those are the bestselling edible insects,' a spokesperson from Leiths told MailOnline Food. The edible bugs were sourced from gourmet insect shops Crunchy Critters and Edible Uniques as well as from Selfridges and Harvey Nichols. Bugs are fast becoming a fixture in upscale restaurants: The best restaurant in the world, Noma in Copenhagen serves its beef tartare with ants; Michelin-starred chef David Faure's alternative menu in his restaurant Aphrodite in France dishes up pate with a side of crickets and London's Archipelago has chocolate-covered locusts on offer. 'Insects have been the tradition in Mexican food since the Aztecs. They have been eaten in Mexico for hundreds of years,' Chef Benito Molina, of Manzanilla Restaurant, Mexico City said to MailOnline Food. 'I think the most important thing that people have to understand is that insects are a very sustainable protein source.' A growing appetite for bugs: Two billion people worldwide supplement their daily diet with high protein bugs . Mealworms, which have a nutty taste and crunchy texture, are matched with with a crisp Clare Valley Viognier . Beth Willard, Wine Buyer at Laithwaite's said: 'On average each buyer will try over 10,000 bottles of wine a year across the world, but we never envisaged making our final selection with insects in mind. There's clearly a growing appetite for them.' 'When you consider that many of the words used to describe the aroma of wine – earthy, grassy, floral – can also be used to describe the bugs' habitats, it's no surprise that wine can really complement the distinctive tastes of insects. The word 'full bodied' will never be the same!' A recent UN report identified edible insects as a sustainable food source for the future. Figures indicate two billion people worldwide already supplement their diet with them. Asian Forest Scorpion - Scorpions have a strong, bitter flavor and are normally eaten with sweet chili sauce. Paris Street Rose is full of rich sweet fruit made from full bodied Transylvanian Pinot Noir, so it will have enough body to cut through the combination of flavours. Mealworms - Match their nutty taste and light, crunchy texture with a crisp Clare Valley Viognier wine that has just the right combination of fruit and richness. Zebra Tarantula - Tarantulas are normally eaten deep fried, so think similar to fish and chips. A lively full bodied Chardonnay will stand up to the complex fishy flavours of the tarantula. Sago Worms - These worms have a distinct taste a bit similar to bacon so you need a big meaty red with loads of punch to match that savoury flavour. McLaren Vale Shiraz is fresh with loads of red fruit and spice . BBQ Locusts - Locusts taste a bit like an exotic bar snack and with the BBQ flavour you'll need a wine with a hint of sweetness. The Hacienda de Lluna Moscatel is a gorgeous lightly bubbly pink that works well as an aperitif. Chocolate dipped locusts - These locusts are essentially a savory dish as they taste a bit like sunflower seeds, but also have the sweetness from the chocolate. A rich robust wine with loads of sweet fruit will stand up to these flavours. Giant Waterbugs -  The meat inside the water bug's body tastes a bit similar to a sweet scallop, while the head has hints of anise, so you'll need to find a wine that can match well with seafood and stronger flavours. A dry sherry, and a Fino at that, is the only choice here. The crisp citrus and nutty flavours will complement their complex flavours. Queen Weaver Ants - Their slightly sour and crunchy tastes like a lemon. They would go well with an aromatic white with pretty fruit and floral notes. A Gewürztraminer provides the perfect balance to crunchy textures. Asian Forest Scorpion - Scorpions have a strong, bitter flavor and are normally eaten with sweet chili sauce. Paris Street Rose is full of rich sweet fruit made from full bodied Transylvanian Pinot Noir, so it will have enough body to cut through the combination of sweet and sour. Crickets - The flavours are much harder to distinguish in crickets and so they are often prepared with garlic and salt. Nevertheless the nutty flavor that comes through means a perfect fit is a rich full-bodied white wine like Albariño. Garlic Chapulines - Have an earthy and grassy flavour and a very crunchy texture, therefore we recommend a creamy dry Champagne that will match well with the earthy flavours (similar to matching with mushrooms) and crunch.","Laithwaite's Wine lists ten bugs and the wines to drink with them .

"Interpol has put tycoon Sergei Pugachev, the partner of former BBC television presenter Alexandra Tolstoy, on its wanted list. The 51-year-old Russian businessman was once so close to the Kremlin he was dubbed 'Putin's banker'. The Interpol 'red notice' - seeking his immediate arrest - has been issued by Russia after he fell out with his former associates. Uneasy truce: Russian tycoon Sergei Pugachev, once worth more than £1billion, has been put on Interpol's wanted list - he was once so close to the Kremlin he was dubbed 'Putin's banker' Wanted: Mr Pugachev is wanted by Russian authorities over alleged large scale fraud and embezzlement - but he says the claims are politically motivated after a campaign by Putin's circle to seize control of his assets . Its official website says Mr Pugachev is 'wanted by the judicial authorities of Russia for prosecution'. Once worth around £1.3billion, he fled Russia after claiming hostile interests were trying to seize his businesses. A former business associate and hunting partner of the Queen's nephew Viscount Linley, Mr Pugachev was close to Putin, with a portfolio of interests across construction, banking and shipbuilding. Russia prosecutors say he deliberately switched money out of Russia to the West from Mezhprombank, the bank he founded, and accuse him of 'large scale fraud and embezzlement'. Mr Pugachev claims the allegations are politically motivated after a campaign by Putin's circle to take control of his assets. Hard times: Mr Pugachev,  is seeking to lift 'a draconian freezing order' issued in London on his assets which left his partner Ms Tolstoy (pictured) to suggest it was hard living on £10,000 a week . In July, he had his assets worth £1billion frozen by a court in London as part of a dispute with a Russian liquidator, and was given a spending limit of £10,000 a week. His partner Ms Tolstoy responded by suggesting the sum was a struggle to live off. 'We are just surviving', she said in the wake of the ruling. Since his fall from grace in Russia, Mr Pugachev has been outspoken in his criticism of Putin. In an interview with the Financial Times last month he said: 'Today in Russia there is no private property. There are only serfs who belong to Putin. 'Now there is Putin and there are his lieutenants who carry out his orders - and all cash generated is put on the balance of Putin. 'The country is in a state of war. And therefore big business cannot live as before. It has to live under military rules.' Elsewhere, he told Time magazine: 'If Putin says he wants to buy something, you cannot say that you do not want to sell. 'If he says ""I want to buy something"" then you say, ""Thanks for saying you want to buy it, and not just taking it"". Mr Pugachev is believed to live with Ms Tolstoy, a descendant of the novelist, in west London. Richard Elsen, reputation management expert at the specialist legal PR agency Byfield Consultancy, told MailOnline: 'Mr Pugachev faces a formidable challenge if he is to successfully argue that the case is politically motivated. Interpol is an unaccountable organisation that is slow to act and any appeal that he makes will take months, if not years, to reach a conclusion. 'In the meantime he will be unable to travel without fear of arrest and his business dealings will be severely damaged, as will his reputation particularly given the intense media interest in his case.'","Sergei Pugachev has been placed on Interpol's 'red notice' wanted list .
