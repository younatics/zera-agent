George Zimmerman has been revealed to have a formidable one-man arsenal. The admitted killer’s five guns - including an AR-15 assault-style rifle, a shotgun and three handguns - were cataloged by Sanford (FL) police during a domestic dispute last year with girlfriend Samantha Scheibe. A police report obtained by RadarOnline showed the handguns were fully loaded when cops arrived on the scene, and Scheibe said he brandished his shotgun when she started moving belongings out of the home the two share. The report showed Zimmerman owns semi-automatic AR-15, a Keltec 12-gauge shotgun, a Walther .380 handgun, a Taurus 9mm handgun, a Glock 19 handgun, more than 100 rounds of ammunition and countless gun holsters and bags. Authorities seized the gun collection after Scheibe called 911 on last November telling the dispatcher that her infamous flame was pointing a gun at her and had smashed a glass coffee table when she said she was leaving him. Zimmerman ‘grabbed the shotgun out of the case,’ she told police, according to the report. ‘George Zimmerman then pointed the shotgun at her and asked, ‘Do you really want to do that?’ When she said she was calling 911, the report said. He ‘struck a glass top table in the living room using the butt of the shotgun, causing it to shatter,’ according to the report. Zimmerman then slung the shotgun ‘over his shoulder… pushed her out of the house and locked the door behind her,’ the report said. Police arrested the unstable former neighborhood watchman and charged him aggravated assault, domestic violence and battery. Authorities issued a restraining order against Zimmerman after Schiebe further accused him of choking her during a subsequent interview with investigators, but she later dropped all charges and claimed she had been ‘intimidated’ by police. Back together: The couple was back together and pictured smiling when picking up the guns only weeks later . A friend of Scheibe’s told MailOnline at the time that loved ones feared for her safety. ‘We would all talk about where the relationship was going, and we knew it would end badly,’ the woman said. ‘He is just a time bomb waiting to go off.' Those sentiments were also echoed last year by both his estranged wife Shellie Zimmerman, who also called him a 'monster,' and Sanford Police Chief Steve Bracknell. Bracknell famously agreed with a local’s comparison of the risk posed by Zimmerman to Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza. Back in the news: Both Zimmerman and rapper DMX found themselves in the headlines last month when a planned boxing match between the two was cancelled . The smiling couple was the picture of happiness when seen a few weeks later leaving a local police department after picking up the guns. Zimmerman was most recently in the news after a planned ‘celebrity boxing match’ between he and rapper DMX was scuttled when scores of people complained about him fighting a black man on national television. The crux of his defense for shooting the unarmed Trayvon Martin, 17, was that he couldn’t defend himself against the teen. He also said was also forced to flee a Miami Beach after people accosted him and a $10,000 bounty was placed on his head. Heavy firepower: A simple attachment to the AR-15 owned by Zimmerman (similar to the one at left) allows it to legally fire 900 rounds per minute, and the shotgun is powerful enough to take down a fully grown deer . Concealed carry: Zimmerman also owns two pistols like the Glock 19 (left) and the Taurus 9mm (right) above, both can easily be carried by the owner in a manner that others can see .","George Zimmerman owns an AR-15, a 12-gauge shotgun, three handguns and has well over 100 rounds of ammunition .

An 89-year-old woman who was raped by a 30-year-old nursing home worker was accused of making up the attack and ‘flirting mercilessly’ with her perpetrator by the administrators of the home. Directors at the Edgewood Vista nursing home in Hermantown, Minnesota have been accused of impeding a rape investigation by suggesting the sex was consensual, court documents show. Andrew Scott Merzwski was sentenced last month to 53 months in jail for the sexual assault of the elderly woman. Andrew Scott Merzwski, 30, was sentenced to 53 months in jail for the rape of an 89-year-old resident at the nursing home where he worked . According to court documents, the victim told a nurse she was getting ready for bed when Merzwski came into her room, The Star Tribune reported. She invited him to sit down and watch a movie with her. Merzwski then walked around the side of her bed and began to take off his clothes. The 89-year-old gestured towards a photograph of her husband saying ‘It’s not right, this wouldn’t be right’, according to testimony that was filed to the court. A police report states that the assault then took place. After the attack the woman’s underwear and sheets were bloodstained so she washed them. The next morning to woman told her daughter about her ordeal, and her daughter reported it to the police. That same say Merzwski admitted having sex with the woman. But the victim’s ordeal only got worse when she was transferred to a hospital in Duluth where she was held for three days in a psychiatric ward while investigators assessed the truth of her claims. 'The room she was in was dark and cold … and they locked her in at night and all she had was a blanket,' nurse examiner Theresa Flesvig said. Administrators at the Edgewood Vista nursing home in Hermantown, Minnesota have been accused of impeding a rape investigation by suggesting sex between a 30-year-old employee and an 89-year-old resident was consensual . It was not until later that she was medically examined for evidence of rape and staff found that she had been badly injured. Ms Flesvig also said that Edgewood’s clinical services director Marilyn Moore asked Ms Flesvig: ‘Did she tell you that this was consensual? Did she tell you that she flirts with this boy mercilessly?’ Ms Flesvig said she was shocked that the blamed was being placed so blatantly on the victim. The victim’s lawyer Mark Kosieradzki argues the state Health Department ‘failed in its duty as a regulator’ because it did not adequately investigate Edgewood Vista’s handling of the incident. The Department of Health initiated an investigation into the attack 10 days after the rape on January 28, 2013. Investigators blamed the attack solely on Merzwski and decided not to hold Edgewood Vista to account over the incident because the nursing home had ‘policies to prevent abuse’. The state carried out two subsequent site inspections and found that Edgewood Vista violated state law by failing to report the incident to police until two days after the rape. Edgewood Management Group said in a statement that it had cooperated with local and state authorities in the ‘criminal matter involving Andrew Merzwski.’ ‘The safety of our residents is of the utmost importance.’","Nursing home accused 89-year-old female resident of inventing story of rape at hands of 30-year-old employee .

"By . Kate Lyons . PUBLISHED: . 22:34 EST, 23 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 04:15 EST, 24 February 2014 . The man who supervised the execution of five inmates in US prisons has revealed the massive emotional toll that his role took on him. In an interview with BBC’s HARDtalk programme, Dr Allen Ault revealed what turned him from the corrections commissioner for the U.S. state of Georgia to a passionate anti-death penalty campaigner. ‘I still have nightmares,’ Dr Ault said in the interview. Allen Ault, the former commissioner of corrections for the state of Georgia talked about his experience overseeing executions at the prison . 'I have spent a lifetime... regretting every moment and every killing': In a heartfelt interview with HARDtalk, Allen Ault opened up about the five executions he oversaw . ‘Although it is state-sanctioned, it is by every definition premeditated murder… It’s the most premeditated form of murder you can possibly imagine and it stays in your psyche forever.’ Dr Ault is a trained psychologist who began working in the prison system in order to help and rehabilitate people, but a promotion to the position of corrections commissioner meant the responsibility for overseeing the state’s executions fell to him. During his time at the prison in the early 1990s, Dr Ault supervised the five executions. The first two executed were Christopher Burger and Thomas Steven, who were accused of a brutal rape and murder in 1977. At the time of the murder Burger was 17 with a borderline mental impairment. He spent 17 years on death row during which time he got an education, received counselling and changed dramatically. ‘He was a different human being,’ said Dr Ault, who added that Burger felt enormous remorse for his crime and his last words were 'Please forgive me'. Those under Dr Ault’s supervision were killed on the electric chair, a method of execution that was outlawed in the state of Georgia in 2001 after the Supreme Court ruled it was a cruel and unusual punishment. The state now uses lethal injection. Dr Ault described watching Burger’s death. ‘We could see the jolt of electricity running through this individual’s body. Snapped his head back and then there was just total silence. And I knew I had killed another human being.’ Executions at the Georgia prison were carried out by electric chair, a method that was ruled to be 'cruel and unusual punishment' by the Georgia Supreme Court in 2001 . He said that the executions were ‘a small part of the job,’ which also involved supervising 15,000 employees and managing the prison, but it was the part of the job that has continued to haunt him. ‘I have spent a lifetime since then regretting every moment and every killing,’ he said in the interview. ‘I was the vehicle for the execution and I have no defence for that.’ Dr Ault resigned from his position in 1995, but by then ‘It was too late'. Since resigning, he has received counselling to process his role in the executions. Haunted: William Henry Hance was one of the five men executed while Dr Ault was commissioner at the prison . He is now the dean of the College of Justice & Safety at Eastern Kentucky University and a strident anti-death penalty campaigner. Together with two other former prison director and two former wardens, Dr Ault fights to stop executions. They appear before legislative groups and campaign on individual cases. ‘I have many of compatriots who were directors who have gone through this… I don’t know any of them that haven’t shed a lot of tears over it,’ he told HARDtalk. Another execution that has stayed with Dr Auld was that of William Henry Hance, a black man convicted of murdering three women. After the trial, one black member of the jury described the atmosphere among the majority white jury as one of racial intimidation, with one white juror saying that the execution would leave ‘one less n****r to breed.’ Despite this, and the fact that Hance’s IQ was so low that some experts believed he was not competent to enter a plea, Hance was executed under Dr Ault’s supervision. Dr Ault says there is definitely a racial dimension to executions. ‘Black people who kill whites are about three times more likely to receive the death penalty than the other way round.’ Georgia is one of 32 states in which the death penalty is legal. Last year there were 39 executions in the U.S. and there have been eight so far in 2014.","Dr Allen Ault was corrections commissioner for Georgia until 1995 .

A Florida teenager is now safely home after a running away with an older man on Tuesday, and her relieved parents have the kind folks at Chick-fil-a to thank. Steve and Tammy Harp of Jacksonville were horrified to find a note from their 16-year-old daughter Kaitlyn in which she told them she'd left with a 19-year-old man she'd met online just months before. Some digging revealed an Instagram photo of Kaitlyn with the man wearing a Chick-fil-a shirt and managers from the beloved southern chicken restaurant soon got involved and in just 24 they'd found the teen and had her heading home. Scroll down for video... Runaway: 16-year-old Kaitlyn Harp, left, ran away with Daniel Bridgeman, 19, on Tuesday and this Instagram photo of in which Bridgeman is wearing a Chick-fil-a uniform quickly helped her parents find her . It was a striking example of the power of social media and also the profound empathy even strangers can have for fellow parents in need. 'Because of their involvement what could have taken days, weeks, or months, only took a matter of two or three hours once they got involve,' an emotional Steve Harp told FCN. 'It is beyond words, as a parent, this is your worst nightmare.' The story began seven months prior when Kaitlyn met 19-year-old Daniel Bridgeman online. The Harps found the note she left on Tuesday and after seeing the photo of their daughter with Bridgeman they rushed to the Jacksonville International Airport Chick-fil-a location in hopes of finding him. Quick thinking: Yulee, Florida Chick-fil-a worker Lita Fannin (left) posted the photo on a site for operators of the southern chicken chain and within two hours Bridgeman was identified . Detective work: Kaitlyn's parents Tammy (left) and Steve (right) say the Chick-fil-a workers helped bring their daughter home faster than the police . The folks at the Chick-fil-a didn't know the man, but they put the Harps in touch with another store manager named Lita Fannin, who asked for pictures of Bridgeman and Kaitlyn. Thanks to Fannin, the photos were then seen by hundreds of Florida Chick-fil-a operators on a Facebook group page and just two hours after she'd posted them, a manager in Winter Haven, Florida recognized Bridgeman. Which is when this tale of the generosity of CHick-fil-a managers gets even more touching. The Winter Haven manager Elio Florin reached out to Bridgeman and got Kaitlyn to call home. That night, Florin personally drove Kaitlyn the three hours from Winter Haven back to Jacksonville. Three hours away: The Harps began their search at a Jacksonville Chick-fil-a (pictured), and word quickly spread statewide. It turns out, Bridgeman worked at a location in Winter Haven, some 200 miles from Jacksonville . Thanks to Fannin and Florin, Kaitlyn was home by 1:30am Wednesday. 'We can't thank them enough,' said Tammy Harp. 'They could have just wiped it away, ""aw no big deal,"" but she put it upon herself, being a mother, said ""I have to get involved.""' And while the Harps are calling her and Florin heroes, Fannin maintains she just did what any parent would. 'I have kids around that age, and I would hope if that happened to me, someone would act quickly,' said Fannin. 'It turned out really positive, really quickly, which is a blessing.' Bridgeman faces no charges, but Florin made sure to give the teen a stern lecture when he arrived to pick up Kaitlyn.","Kaitlyn Harp ran away with Chick-fil-a worker Daniel Bridgeman on Tuesday .

They may look like grandfather and granddaughter - but 29-year-old Nicola and 67-year-old Joe Philpot are actually husband and wife. When they fell for each other, Nicola was just 16 years old and the romance caused a huge backlash from their families. Joe, who is a grandfather, was even branded a paedophile by locals in their hometown of Chigwell, Essex. Nicola and Joe have faced a great deal of opposition to their romance after meeting when Nicola was 16 and Joe was 54 . The couple have been together for over 13 years and now have four children; (L-R) Kody (8), Felicity (12), Lilly Rose (11 months) and Thomas (10) But the couple have always defended their unconventional relationship and now have proved their critics wrong as they plan to renew their wedding vows after celebrating their 13th anniversary. They are proud parents to Felicity, 12, Cody, eight, Thomas 10, and Lilly-Rose - who was born just 11 months ago. And the pair insists they still have an active sex life - despite the fact Joe suffers from angina and arthritis. Nicola said: 'Even though Joe’s more than double my age, he’s so full of energy. 'He might have 10 teeth missing and a bit of a pot belly, but he’s absolutely gorgeous to me.' When Nicola first started dating Joe, the uncle of a school friend, she had just turned 16 and he was a 54-year-old divorced father of three. Nicola, then 18 years old, on her wedding day in August 2000. Nicola's family didn't approve of the match and she still doesn't speak to many of them . She said: 'I would often see him when I was doing my local paper round and when we chatted there was an instant attraction. 'He seemed fun and would play my favourite 60s’ music like the Bee Gees. I knew I wanted to be with Joe - it didn’t feel weird, it felt right.' Despite the 38-year age gap, the feeling was mutual for retired plumber Joe and he made the first move. Joe and Nicola pictured with children Felicity, Kody and Thomas (wearing blue T-shirt), celebrating Christmas at their home in Essex . Nicola says they have a perfect family package and if people have a problem with their age difference it is their problem . He said: ‘I felt if I didn’t say anything it might be something I regretted for the rest for my life.' Just two weeks after admitting their feelings for each other, Nicola moved in to Joe’s house. A year later, Nicola gave birth to Felicity and a year after that the couple were wed. Nicola said: 'A lot of people didn’t agree with our relationship. When we first went out, people would call Joe names - like paedophile. Joe says he doesn't feel his age and 'loves running around after the kids. I'm a hand's on dad and I love every minute of it' 'My family stopped talking to me and all but one of Joe’s children cut all ties with him. It caused a huge rift but I’d never been so happy in my life. Joe, here with his fourth child, six month-old Lilly-Rose, has become estranged from many of his children from former partnerships, over the union . 'It was upsetting that I didn’t have the support of my family but Joe and I thought we were just a normal couple in love and we wanted to be together no matter what.' She added: 'Mum still doesn’t approve and I hardly speak with any of my family now. 'I don’t see what their problem is - if one of my daughters wanted to date an older man I wouldn’t stop her - I think older men treat women better.' Today, full-time mother Nicola said she and Joe have the perfect family package. She added: 'I’ve always wanted a family young and despite the age difference between Joe and me, I’ve never had trouble conceiving. 'We decided to try for another baby a couple of years ago and now have the perfect package. 'When we go to the shops, people often assume Joe’s the kids’ grandfather. But he doesn’t seem to mind and finds it all a bit funny. 'Joe’s a great dad and still has plenty of energy to play with them. He’s young for his age and I tend not to think about what will happen in the future. I live for every moment as it comes. 'I’m just as in love with Joe as the first day I met him-we now hope to save up money to renew our wedding vows very soon.' Joe added: 'I don’t feel my age and love running around after the kids. I’m a hands-on dad and I love every minute of it. 'We’re just a normal family - we go to the park at weekends take the kids on camping holiday.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 01:55 EST, 24 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 01:55 EST, 24 February 2014 . In a lengthy profile of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, the U.S. spy chief said it would be impossible to prevent intelligence leaks like those perpetrated by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden and former Army intelligence analyst Bradley Manning, who has changed his name to Chelsea now that he is imprisoned after being convicted of espionage. In the profile, Clapper explains that the size of the intelligence community makes it virtually impossible to guarantee that leaks like those of Snowden and Manning won't happen again. 'In the end,' Clapper says, 'we will never ever be able to guarantee that . there will not be an Edward Snowden or another Chelsea Manning because . this is a large enterprise composed of human beings with all their . idiosyncrasies.' Tough job: Clapper says that despite the safeguards, there is no way to guarantee people won't leak classified information . The profile was written by long-time national security journalist Eli Lake and published on the Daily Beast website. Lake describes Clapper's job as 'the worst job in Washington' due in part to the great responsibility that comes with being the person responsible for gathering the information that's used to keep the country safe from enemies. Gathering intelligence within the perimeters of the Constitution can present challenges for those in charge of gathering it - and balancing the duty of keeping people safe with individual privacy continues to be a difficult task for the U.S. intelligence community. Adding to the difficulty for Clapper is the fact that annual intelligence budgets are being cut for the first time since the job of Direct of National Intelligence was created in 2005 in response to suggestions made in the 9/11 Commission, which found that intelligence agencies like the CIA and FBI weren't communicating with each other, which led to major lapses in national security. Snowden: Clapper says he can't understand what motivates a fellow intelligence officer like Snowden to leak damaging information . According to Lake's profile, though, the biggest problem Clapper has continues to be Snowden, and the troves of information he turned over to journalists at the Washington Post, the Guardian and other news outlets - as well as information that he hasn't released, which could fall into the hands of the Russians or the Chinese. Currently, Snowden is in temporary asylum in Russia. According to Lake, the U.S. government still doesn't know 'the full extent of what Snowden revealed or whether more documents that have yet to be published in the press have made their way into the hands of Russian or Chinese intelligence agencies.' What's troubling for Clapper is the fact that the information Snowden leaked to the media came from a database designed to share intelligence amongst agencies within the government - which has been the primary mission of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence since it was created at the suggestion of the 9/11 Commission. Lake explains that the job of the ODNI has been to 'transform the intelligence community’s “need to know” culture to one of “need to share.”' 'Traitor': Bradley Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking classified information to Wikileaks . It was those changes, Lake says, that allowed Snowden and Manning to exploit the new system to leak classified information. As for Snowden, Clapper has a hard time grasping why he - as a fellow intelligence officer charged with keeping Americans safe - would do what he did. 'Maybe if I had I’d understand him better because I have trouble . understanding what he did or what he’d do,' the director said. 'From my . standpoint, the damage he’s done. I could almost accept it or understand . it if this were simply about his concerns about so-called domestic . surveillance programs. But what he did, what he took, what he has . exposed, goes way, way, way beyond the so-called domestic surveillance . programs.” As an intelligence profession, Clapper says 'it’s gut . wrenching for me to see so much of this so casually exposed. It’s terrible.'","Clapper says the job of Director of National Intelligence is to force intelligence agencies to cooperate with each other .

"By . Chris Pleasance . PUBLISHED: . 06:41 EST, 24 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 07:12 EST, 24 February 2014 . Ann Harrison was kidnapped and murdered almost 25 years ago by Michael Taylor and Roderick Nunley. Controversy around Taylor's execution on Wednesday threatens to overshadow her memory . Friends of murdered schoolgirl Ann Harrison have expressed frustration that the debate over lethal injections threatens to overshadow the 25th anniversary of her death. Ann was kidnapped while on her way to school in Kansas City in 1989, raped and then stabbed to death by Michael Taylor and Roderick Nunley, who were both sentenced to death. On Wednesday Taylor is due to be killed by lethal injection, but last-minute legal appeals over the type of drug to be used have threatened to forestall the execution. Tina Thomasee, who was in Ann's class at school, has said the focus should be on remembering the 'wonderful spirit' of Ann, not debating the fate of her killers. In an interview with the Kansas City Star, she said: 'We would rather the world focus on Ann, and who she was, instead of controversies over death penalty drugs and the death penalty itself. 'Ann deserves to be remembered for the wonderful spirit that she was, and continues to be, for her family, friends and community.' On March 22, the date of Ann's disappearance, Ms Thomasee plans to hold a ceremony to commemorate Ann's life along with other former friends and her parents. However the national debate caused by Taylor's legal appeal over the drugs to be used in his execution mean the event could be overshadowed. Due to difficulties in obtaining pentobarbital, a powerful sedative used in lethal injections, from a licenced drug supplier, Missouri officials have been forced to seek out smaller compounding pharmacies to make the drug. But the use of compounded pentobarbital is controversial as it has been linked to at least one prolonged, painful execution in the case of of Michael Lee Wilson, 38, in Oklahoma. Wilson, who was executed on January 9, said he felt his 'whole body burning' before he died after being injected with compounded pentobarbital. Taylor's lawyers argue that the use of the chemical would cause their client 'severe, unnecessary, lingering and ultimately inhumane pain', violating the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment. Michael Taylor (left) has argued that injecting him with compounded pentobarbital would cause him 'inhuman pain and suffering'. In January Lee Wilson (right) said he felt his 'whole body burning' after being given the drug . The Apothecary Shoppe, a pharmacy in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which was due to supply the lethal chemical for Taylor's execution, has now refused to do so. Missouri state officials say the execution will go ahead as planned as they have found another supplier, though they have refused to name the company for fear that bad publicity would drive them away. Both Taylor and Nunley have faced execution once before and have been granted last-minute reprieves. Taylor was just hours from death in 2006 when a judge ruled the procedure should not go ahead. But despite the controversy Ann's parents, Bob and Janel Harrison, say they are determined to see the punishment through. Speaking to the Kansas Star, Janel said: 'People talk about closure. There’s no such thing as closure. What we want is justice for Ann.' While the Harrison's have so far avoided the executions, Bob has vowed to be there on Wednesday if Taylor is put to death. He said his drive to see the case through to the end is the thought of what Ann went through during her last few minutes of life. 'That’s the part I can’t stop thinking about,' he said. 'That’s the part that makes them need to have this punishment.' Lethal injections rely on three chemicals which have been in short supply since an EU ban on exports in 2011 . Introduced in Oklahoma in 1977, the lethal injection is by far the most commonly used method in executions in the United States. Standard procedure sees IV drips inserted into both arms of the prisoner - one for the injection and another in case the main line fails. The convict is then given three chemicals in order to kill them. The first is a barbiturate, a heavy sedative which puts them to sleep and will eventually stop their breathing even if the second two drugs are not administered. The second is a paralytic, usually pancuronium bromide, which causes complete paralysis of all muscles, including the diaphragm, and would again cause death by asphyxiation if administered alone. However in order to achieve the most painless death a third drug, potassium chloride, is then administered which stops the heart and causes death by cardiac arrest. But following a ban in the EU in 2011on exporting drugs to be used in lethal injections, a shortage developed. Licensed US manufacturers have also been refusing to supply the chemicals required, due to fears over bad publicity. Now authorities have been forced to seek out small compounding pharmacies which are not licensed by the Food and Drug Administration, but can produce the drugs on a case-by-case basis. Some states have also started experimenting with different combinations of lethal drugs due to the scarcity of those commonly used. However, this has left officials open to legal challenges, the most common of which is based on the constitutional guarantee to a death free from cruel or unusual punishment. Lawyers argue that untested drug combinations, or contaminated drugs from smaller pharmacies, will lead to lengthy, painful and ultimately inhumane deaths. In January, Lee Wilson was executed using compounded pentobarbital and said he felt his 'whole body burning' before he died, which his lawyers agreed was the result of contamination. Later the same month Dennis McGuire was put to death in Ohio using an untried combination of drugs, but appeared to gasp and snort during the procedure which took an unusually-long 25 minutes.","Ann Harrison was kidnapped, raped and murdered in 1989 .

U.S. health authorities are currently investigating a fourth possible outbreak of norovirus aboard a cruise ship this year. Officials with the Centers for Disease Control boarded the Holland America cruise ship ms Veendam Saturday in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. During the course of the week-long Caribbean cruise, 114 passengers and 10 crew members got sick - suffering mainly from vomiting and diarrhea.There were a total of 1,273 passengers on board and 575 crew members. Outbreak: The CDC is currently investigating a possible outbreak of norovirus aboard the Holland America cruise ship ms Veendam. The ship just wrapped a week-long voyage of the Caribbean . A CDC environmental health officer and epidemiologist will conduct an assessment of the ship and determine the outbreak. They will also be testing stool samples from the sick passengers and crew members. While the cause of the outbreak has not yet been discerned, if it turns out to be norovirus it would be the fourth such instance aboard a cruise ship this year. Last month, three cruise ships had outbreaks - including a particularly nasty case aboard the Explorer of the Seas. Over 600 passengers aboard the Royal Caribbean Cruise Line got sick with norovirus, in addition to 55 crew members. Another outbreak aboard a Princess Cruise line caused the ship to cut short it's seven-day trip. What is norovirus? Also known as the Winter Vomiting Bug in the UK, norovirus is a very contagious illness that causes the stomach and intestines to become inflamed. Vacation from hell: The worst case of norovirus this year happened aboard the Royal Caribbean ship Explorer of the Seas, in which over 600 passengers were infected . And this isn't the first time the ms Veendam had an outbreak of illnesses. Since the CDC has been posting cruise-ship outbreak reports online, the ship has had seven cases of mass illness. Just last spring, a ms Veendam cruise was infected with E. coli. And there were two cases of norovirus in the span of three months of 2005. It seems the outbreak could have been prevented as well. In September the ship failed a CDC sanitation inspection, after brown liquid was found dripping on clean dishes and a fly in the buffet. 'While unacceptable for Holland America Line, the unsatisfactory score is highly unusual and an aberration,' Holland America's Sally Andrews said last year. The CDC grades cruise ships on a 100-point scale, and anything less than an 85 is considered failing. The ms Veendam got a 77.","The CDC is investigating the ms Veendam, which returned to port on Saturday after a week-long Caribbean cruise .

The 32-year-old facility in downtown Minneapolis was being demolished last week but officials halted work after one part of the ring beam fell out of sequence. Scroll down for demolition video . Parts of the Metrodome stadium fall on Sunday in Minneapolis. Crews are planning to use controlled explosive charges as they continue to demolish the roof structure . The 32-year-old facility was being demolished last week but a ring beam fell out of sequence - forcing the use of explosives . After consulting with structural and demolition experts, the Minnesota Sports Facility Authority recommended bringing down the remaining portion of the ring beam with controlled explosives. Contractors did so using 84 charges of dynamite in 24 columns of the upper concourse. The public were kept 250 feet from the site, and the nearby light-rail station was closed during the demolition. The explosion went off without a hitch and no one was injured during the controlled event. Mortenson Construction said that the demolition of the Metrodome is still on schedule. It is expected to be completely torn down by the end of April 2014. The stadium opened in 1982 and was home to the NFL team Minnesota Vikings until the end of the last season.

When 13-year-old Max Brown came down with a cold, his worried mother gave him ibuprofen. But the over-the-counter medication almost cost him his life after a violent allergic reaction left him covered in severe blisters and his lips turned black. It became so bad that he screamed in pain when anyone touched him and was left slipping in and out of consciousness as he fought for his life in intensive care. In bandages: Max Brown, 13, on a ventilator in intensive care after his severe reaction to the over-the-counter medicine . Max was diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), a condition which causes the cells in the top layer of the skin to die before shedding. He spent just over a month in hospital in November, during which his devastated mother Nichola Wheatley was warned he could die. ‘The doctors were 100 per cent certain that the ibuprofen caused Max’s reaction,’ she said at her home in Esher, Surrey, yesterday. ‘I didn’t know he was allergic, he had taken ibuprofen before years ago. It was the biggest shock of my life.’ The traumatic events started when Miss Wheatley, a 45-year-old teaching assistant, noticed that Max was not well so kept him off school for a couple of days. Life-threatening: His mother Nicola Wheatley was told Max could die as a result of his extreme reaction . Thinking he had a cold, she began giving him standard doses of liquid ibuprofen. But within a matter of days his entire body was covered in rashes and blisters. She took him to her GP, who told her to take Max straight to hospital. He was admitted to hospital but at first doctors were baffled by what was wrong. By this time his skin was blistering and peeling off, while his lips were swollen, black and crusted. Miss Wheatley said: ‘It is the most horrific thing for a parent to have to see their child suffer the way Max has. I was devastated. ‘My son was so ill and I couldn’t hold him or kiss him. He was screaming because his skin was so raw. I felt helpless. Nobody could tell us what was happening because nobody knew.’ Treatment: He spent a month in hospital after he was diagnosed Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) Max was taken to a specialist unit for more tests and was diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. After a week in hospital his condition had deteriorated so much that he couldn’t open his eyes because of the scabbing and his whole body was blistered, raw and peeling. Miss Wheatley said: ‘That was the worst thing for me. I had no idea if he was going to get better or not. I was stuck in limbo watching my son’s health deteriorate.’ Max was then taken into intensive care at another hospital where he was put on morphine and antibiotics. His weight dropped to six stone and his mother said doctors did not know whether he would survive. ‘Max needed help breathing and had bandages covering his entire body,’ she said. Covered up: His weight dropped to six stone and his mother said doctors did not know whether he would survive . ‘Every day he would have to have the bandages changed to stop infection, but I could see he was in agony whenever anyone touched his skin. He was drifting in and out of consciousness.’ With no known cure, the disorder was left to run its course and after four weeks his skin began to clear and he was allowed home. Miss Wheatley said: ‘I am so proud of him for pulling through. He will have the scars for the rest of his life, but it is a small price to pay when he nearly died. ‘More research needs to be done to help SJS sufferers. It is a horrific illness and causes so much disfigurement and pain.’ Well: The disorder was left to run its course and after four weeks his skin began to clear and he was allowed home to be with his family .","Over-the-counter medicine almost cost Max Brown, 13, his life .

Holding an umbrella, plus your bag and anything else you need when out and about in the rain can make enjoying a coffee on the go rather tricky. But that's all about to change because a gadget has been invented to stop rain-lashed commuters being forced to awkwardly juggle a brolly with their morning coffee. And it's so good, you'll wonder why you didn't think of it yourself! Now you can stay dry and still hold a cuppa while out and about in the rain . A nifty new invention means you can easily hold your umbrella without struggle to enjoy a coffee on the go . The device is a cup holder which clips on to the centre pole of an umbrella and enables a user to carry their drinks with ease. The contraption is able to pivot, which means your beverage will stay upright whether your brolly is furled or open. The nifty new invention, called the Morella, enables people to have a spare hand which they can use to carry a bag, check their phone or change a track on their mp3 player. It can be removed and attached within minutes by twisting the nut on the side and will fit a variety of different sized umbrellas. It comes in two models - one for single cups, and another that can hold two drinks. The Morella lets you hold a single cup of your favourite drink or you can help a mate and hold two . The product was invented by friends Andrew Tan, 35, Ross Malcolm, 36, and Jordan Schlipf, 30. Andrew, from West London, said: 'My friend Ross was outside a pub in when it started to rain, so he had his drink in one hand and an umbrella in the other. 'He then realised there could be a product that would make them easier to hold and got in touch with me and another friend, Jordan. You don't have to be on the move. Use your umbrella as a handy cup holder when you're chatting with friends . 'Initially I laughed and then I realised that it could actually be something really useful and that it just might work. 'We made a few prototypes out of cardboard and then approached some designers and got it patented. 'The Morella comes in two different styles, a single cup holder and a double cup holder. 'Someone can easily attach one to an umbrella by unscrewing the nut, putting it around the pole, and then screwing it back on. 'The holder can move so that no matter how the umbrella is held, the drinks will always stay upright because the centre of gravity is below the pivot. 'It makes it easier to carry an umbrella and a drink and frees up a hand to hold a bag, get something out of a pocket, use a mobile phone or change the song on an mp3 player. 'It’s perfect for commuters who might be carrying a lot of things or for festival-goers who are trying to fetch a couple of drinks in the rain.' The Morella has been launched on Kickstarter where Andrew, Ross, and Jordan hope to raise £35,000 for the manufacturing process. The expected retail price for the single-cup device is between £5 and £10, and between £8 and £12 for the double. With the Morella you have a free hand to send emails, texts and make calls in the rain .","Invented by Andrew Tan, 35, Ross Malcolm, 36 and Jordan Schlipf, 30 .

Soaring numbers of 'wolf breed' dogs, such as Malamutes, are being abandoned by owners unable to cope with the pets . Soaring numbers of ‘wolf breed’ dogs are being abandoned by owners unable to cope with the pets - which have become popular after featuring in cult films and television shows such as Twilight and Game of Thrones. Charities including The Dogs Trust say hundreds of dogs such as Malamutes, Huskies and Sarloos were given up last year because their demands for attention and exercise are proving too much. And last week, six day-old Eliza-Mae Mullane was mauled to death by her parents’ pet Alaskan Malamute at their home in Pontyberem, Carmarthenshire. Police are currently still investigating the circumstances of the tot’s death and have not destroyed the dog. The Dogs Trust, Britain’s largest dog rescue charity, has experienced a three-fold rise in wolf breed dogs brought to its rehoming centres. The charity says it is ‘gravely concerned’ about the situation, saying unscrupulous breeders are also to blame, for selling the dogs to people in town-centre flats who were out at work all day and left them unattended. Last year the trust took in 261 abandoned wolf-type dogs — up from 78 in 2010. Although known for being friendly, affectionate and loyal, wolf breed dogs are also prone to separation anxiety and extreme boisterousness. Steve Goward, training and behavioural advisor at The Dogs Trust, said: ‘These dogs are beautiful creatures and can make wonderful companions but they need owners who understand the demands of this breed and are in a position to offer a lifetime commitment. ‘We are seeing too many of these dogs being abandoned when they become too much for their owners and rescue centres have to pick up the pieces.’ Tragedy: Last week, six day-old Eliza-Mae Mullane was mauled to death by her parents' pet Alaskan Malamute at their home in Pontyberem, Carmarthenshire . Another animal rescue charity, Blue Cross, reported a five-fold increase in the number of dogs handed in over the last five years, from 10 in 2008 to 52 last year. The organisation’s head of rehoming, Mandy Jones, said: ‘Copying your favourite celebrity’s hairstyle is one thing but we urge people to put a lot more thought into getting a new pet. ‘We see so many animals given up because their owners did not realise how much time and effort it takes to care for them.’ On Game of Thrones dire wolves, played by Northern Inuit dogs are adopted as pups by the children of nobleman Ned Stark, played by Sean Bean . She added: ‘Sadly, the ‘have-it-now’ attitude of today’s consumer society seems to be the same whether you are buying a handbag or a dog.’ Game of Thrones features dire wolves, played by Northern Inuit dogs which resemble a cross between a German shepherd and malamute. On the show, the dogs are adopted as pups by the children of nobleman Ned Stark, played by Sean Bean, after being found in a forest moping around their dead mother, who had been killed by a deer. The makers of the show had considered using actual wolves but they are illegal in the UK, where the series is filmed.","Breeds became popular after featuring in shows such as Game of Thrones .

NSW Police told the MailOnline they are preparing a report for the state Coroner on the body of the 47-year-old who was found in a unit on Cowper Wharf Road, Woolloomooloo yesterday. Police said forensic officers will conduct a post mortem to establish the cause of the death of the woman who is yet to be 'formally' identified. Struggling to cope: Young model Maddy Huett (left, pictures with Charlotte Dawson) is 'struggling' to cope after reportedly identifying the body of the women she regarded as her 'Sydney mother' Mentor: Charlotte Dawson (left) mentored 20-year-old model Simone Holtznagel (right) who along with Maddy Huett regarded the TV star as her 'Sydney mum' and remained friends after the 2012 Australia's Next Top Model show was over . Maddy Huett regarded Dawson as her 'Sydney mother"", along with another model contestant, Simone Holtznagel, Dawson having mentored the two young girls both of whom do not come from Sydney. Huett is from Tasmania and Holtznagel is from the Illawarra region several hours south of Sydney. Eerily, Huett posted a message about depression on her Twitter account three days before Dawson's death, when friends say the TV star was in 'very bad shape emotionally, terrible shape'. Huett posted '1 in 3 of us go through depression, anxiety or panic attacks at least once in our life . . . let those who struggle know they are not alone'. Work worries: Dawson (centre) pictured with contestants from Australia's Next Top Model allegedly had money worries and was not continuing as host of the modelling show, although there are mixed reports as to whether she quite the show because of its 'toxic' message about body image, or was not renewed . Huett's mother said her daughter had been 'very close to' Dawson. 'She called her, her Sydney mother. She's strugglling. She'll be alright [but] they just became very good friends after the show. '[Dawson's death] is very affecting. It's very affecting for a lot of people. 'I just think [Dawson] had depression and it's a serious issue. '[Maddy] is trying to cope, coping with the awful news. It's just a sad period in her life.' Since yesterday, friends of Huett's have posted messages of support on her Twitter account. 'Love to you at this sad time,' wrote Kezza72. 'Thinking of you gorgeous girl xxxxx,' wrote brooklynokeefe. Cottrellclaire wrote, 'love to you beautiful. Thinking of you.' A message from brideilarby to Huett, who has now left Tasmania and made Sydney her permanent home, read, 'Thinking of you honey... Know there's always a bed and home cooked meal across the sea if you need me (or a vanilla malt pop) big love xxx'. Maddy Huett (left) and Simone Holtznagel (right), pictured in Sydney with US rocker Steven Tyler, were both contestants in Australia's Next Top Model, after which they became friends with Dawson, nursing her after her 2012 hospitilisation over depression and regarding her as their 'adopted mum' Huett's mother said her daughter had abandoned her modelling. 'She's no longer pursuing her mdoelling career. She's changing channels,' she said. Last year Ok! Magazine interviewed Dawson about her mothering of Huett and Holtznagel, in a story with the headline, 'Meet My Adopted Daughters'. Dawson had earlier told an interviewer she had become pregnant while married to Scott Miller, but she terminated the pregnancy because the swim star was preparing for the 2000 Olympics. Dawson told Ok! that Simone had literally saved her life. 'Simone . . . found a white-tail spider in my bed!' she said. Simone was staying the night at her Dawson's apartment – something the two girls did often – when she discovered the spider between the sheets. 'I was making Charlotte’s bed and I flipped the doona back and there it was,' Simone told Ok!. 'Charlotte was like, 'Is it even dangerous?' and I was like, 'Yeah, it can kill you!'.' The girls spoke of how they nursed Charlotte back to health after her 14-year battle with depression, which landed her in St Vincents hospital, in August 2012. You are not alone: Posted on Huett's Twitter page before her 'adopted mum' Dawson's death, this message from Mental Health Week is an eerie reminder of the struggle Dawson was having, which landed her in hospital, after which Huett and another young model nursed her back to health . 'They help me; they're really good – like when I went to hospital, they came and looked after me; they picked me up from the hospital.' Maddy Huett told Ok! Charlotte was the kind of person 'who you just automatically warm to – she’s nurturing and the one that you connect with the most on the show – but she’s our mum!' But when it came to Dawson's latest battle with depression, it appears no-one could save her this one final time.","Australia's Next Top Model contestant, 25, reportedly identified Dawson's body .

Meet Nigella Lawson's Team Cupcake - the PR, lawyer and family member helping the TV chef win the public sympathy battle against her ex-husband Charles Saatchi. She may have admitted snorting cocaine and smoking cannabis as she gave evidence in court this week, but it seems she hasn't lost many fans over the revelation. According to a survey, 'Domestic Goddess' Nigella has actually gained public sympathy since dramatically giving evidence at the trial of her two former assistants accused of fraud. The YouGov poll found that 39 per cent of people have more sympathy for Miss Lawson than they did before she gave evidence - compared with just two per cent who have taken her ex-husband's side. Team Cupcake: Nigella Lawson's team of lawyers, PRs and family who supported her as she gave evidence at Isleworth Crown Court . Nigella Lawson, pictured arriving at court this week (left), seems to have won more public sympathy with her admission of taking drugs while ex-husband Charles Saatchi, right, has seen his reputation apparently tarnished . As she went through the ordeal of giving . evidence at Isleworth Crown Court, she has been supported by a whole team of advisers. Her team at her side included two leading lawyers at Schillings - Chris Scott, a partner, and associate Joelle Rich. She was also supported by her brother Dominic Lawson, a newspaper columnist, and her PR adviser Mark Hutchinson who has worked with her since she published her first book in 1998. He also works with JK Rowling. Around two thirds of people surveyed by YouGov said her drug confession made no difference to their opinion of her with and only 20 per cent thought less of the 53-year-old because of it. Ten per cent said that their perception of Miss Lawson has now improved, according to the Sunday Times. During the fraud trial at Isleworth Crown Court, a scathing email from ex-husband Charles Saatchi accused her of being 'so off your head on drugs' that she had allowed the PAs to spend 'whatever they liked'. In a dramatic courtroom confession during two days on the witness stand, Miss Lawson admitted to having snorted cocaine and having smoked cannabis in front of her children. Testimony: Nigella spent a gruelling two days in the witness box being asked about her marriage to Charles Saatchi . Happier times: Nigella and Charles Saatchi before they split back in June after an incident at Scott's restaurant in central London . On trial: Italian sisters Elisabetta (left) and Francesca Grillo who are accused of a £685,000 credit card fraud using Charles Saatchi's company credit cards . But she denied being an addict claiming said she needed the drugs to cope with the death of her first husband, John Diamond, and the ‘intimate terrorism’ of her second, Charles Saatchi. Miss Lawson protested 'I am being put on trial here' as she was repeatedly questioned about drug-taking and the collapse of her marriage. While her drug-taking admission grabbed the headlines, she also told of Mr Saatchi's temper and his keen interest in domestic life. She also accused him of subjecting her to 'intimate terrorism'. The mother-of-two was actually giving evidence against her two former public assistants Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo at Isleworth Crown Court. The Italian sisters are accused of going on lavish shopping sprees and spending £685,000 on Charles Saatchi's company credit cards over a four-year period. They deny any wrongdoing. While critics have said Miss Lawson's reputation has been on trial, she appears to have garnered a great deal of public sympathy. Not damaged: PR experts have claimed that revelations that she took drugs in the past might even boost her career in the US . Mr Saatchi told the jury that he still 'adores' Nigella and is 'heartbroken' that they divorced after a 10-year marriage. The couple's marriage collapsed after he accepted a police caution for grabbing Nigella by the throat outside Scott's restaurant in Mayfair, central London, earlier this year. James Herring of public relations firm Taylor Herring, told the Sunday Times: 'Whoever was behind the allegations of Nigella Lawson's drug taking seems to have overestimated the damage it would do. 'Nigella is very much her own brand and that brand is about foodie indulgence and authenticity. 'People like their celebrities to be fallible and human.' The TV chef is currently trying to crack the lucrative American market with a second series of her show The Taste due to start airing next month. The show is being brought to Britain by Channel 4 in the new year. And some PR experts have claimed that rather than ending her Stateside career, her drug revelations might even give it a boost. PR guru Mark Borkowski, compared Nigella to the likes of Kate Moss, BP, Ryan Air and Elton John,  'brands', which have successfully bounced back from adverse publicity. Writing in his personal blog he said: 'Post crisis the beleaguered brand with the best story will recover more quickly. 'Brands and individuals may well suffer slights and injuries, but with a brilliant team, smarter thinking, resilient strategy, perspective and intuitive creativity they can rise from yesterday’s newspaper with a stronger narrative and a much brighter, sounder future.'

Europe faces a ‘lost generation’ who may never work as joblessness soars to record levels in the eurozone. New figures show that, for the first time since the single currency was  created in 1999, the unemployment rate hit 12 per cent – compared with 7.7 per cent in Britain. The grim milestone reveals a generational disaster in the making in near-bankrupt southern European nations. Problems: Unemployment across the Eurozone has struck 12 per cent for the first time since the currency was launched. It follows the recent Cyprus crisis.  A woman withdraws money from the ATM of a bank in Nicosia . In Greece, 58 per cent of under-25s . are unemployed, along with 56 per cent in Spain and 38 per cent in . Portugal and Italy. In the eurozone as a whole it is 24 per cent. In the . UK it is 21 per cent. Across the eurozone, 19million are out of work. For the EU as a whole, the figure is 26.3million. Downing Street admitted that ministers . still fear that economic deterioration in the eurozone will have a . chilling effect on the UK economy. ‘It remains very much as it has been, . which is clearly that the issues that have impacted on the eurozone . have also impacted on the UK economy,’ a spokesman said. ‘That’s why we . need to stick to the course we are on.’ EU Employment Commissioner Laszlo . Andor added: ‘Such unacceptably high levels of unemployment are a . tragedy for Europe and a signal of how serious a crisis some eurozone . countries are now in.’ The figures released yesterday are for . February – before the Cyprus crisis which saw the controversial . £8.5billion bailout that experts believe has further destabilised the . euro and may cost even more jobs. While Cyprus has 14 per cent unemployment, it is expected to get worse. Greece has the EU’s worst rate at 26.4 per cent. Experts warned that alienation caused . by unemployment could set Europe back  for years. Andrea Broughton, . principal research fellow at the Institute for  Employment Studies, . said: ‘Youth unemployment remains the EU’s biggest  employment-related . headache, and shows no signs of abating. ‘Urgent action is required to avoid  the creation of a lost generation of young people who have been denied access to work.’ Marie Diron, senior economic adviser . at Ernst & Young, said: ‘The economic and social consequences of . high unemployment continue to represent one of the most significant . threats to the future of the eurozone.’ The downturn in manufacturing in the eurozone has also deepened. The purchasing managers’ index of . activity – where anything below 50 represents decline – fell from 47.9 . in February to 46.8 in March. The sharpest decline was in Greece, . followed by France. The eurozone economy shrank 0.6 per cent in the final quarter of last year. n DAVID Cameron’s hopes of reclaiming . powers from Brussels have suffered a setback after both Germany and . France refused to co-operate. The Prime Minister has hailed a . review being conducted by the Foreign Office as paving the way for a . renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with the EU  ahead of his . promised referendum on the issue in 2017. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel . and French President Francois Hollande have decided not to take part, . calling it ‘a British domestic political exercise’.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:08 EST, 27 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 14:06 EST, 27 January 2014 . On the roster: Ronan Farrow, 26, has been assigned the 1pm time slot on MSNBC . MSNBC has given Ronan Farrow a time slot for his new show which will start late next month. The 26-year-old's yet-untitled show will take the 1pm time slot on the cable news network and will premiere on February 24. Farrow is Mia Farrow's son and a former foreign policy official in the Obama administration. The announcement about his program is just one in a series of moves that the network is making as it shuffles its daytime schedule. Farrow will be followed by a new show at 2pm with Joy Reid, managing editor of The Grio.com. Current shows hosted by Tamron Hall and Andrea Mitchell will air at 11am and noon respectively. The daytime openings were created by the move of Thomas Roberts to the early slot before 'Morning Joe' and the exit of Martin Bashir following crude comments he made about Sarah Palin. Alex Wagner moved her show from noon to 4pm in the wake of Bashir's exit, and she'll keep that schedule. Following weeks of speculation, Bashir released a statement at the beginning of December explaining his decision to resign over the 'ill-judged' comments about the former Alaskan governor's comparison of the federal debt to slavery. He previously apologized to Palin both on and off camera, but came under further fire when fellow MSNBC host Alec Baldwin was fired for making homophobic comments to journalists outside of his apartment while he was not formally reprimanded in any way until now. Starting early: Farrow has previously worked as a special adviser to Hillary Clinton when she was the Secretary of State (pictured here in 2011) and also held the title of global youth ambassador for the United Nations . MSNBC is known for their left-leaning political allegiances, and Farrow adds another connection to the Democratic party to their channel's roster. Farrow previously held the title of . UNICEF spokesman advocating for youth issues and later was appointed as a . special advisor to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2011. Alex Wagner, whose show will immediately precede Farrow's, is engaged to the White House chef, Sam Kass. The couple have kept their relationship purposefully quiet but were dating for about a year before eagle-eyed viewers began noticing that Wagner was wearing an engagement ring on a very precarious finger in October. Old and new: Martin Bashir (left) resigned in early December and Alex Wagner (right) was promptly bumped up to his noon time slot to take over . No details about Farrow's contract . with MSNBC have been released, so his salary remains a secret, but he . clearly plans to be around for a while as he just bought a $1.495million . condo near Lincoln Center in Manhattan. The New York Post reported that Farrow bought the two . bedroom, two bathroom apartment in a building that allows the owner . access to a communal roof deck that looks out at the Hudson River on one . side and Central Park on the other. According to Zillow, 15th floor apartment has skyline views visible through the floor-to-ceiling windows that keeps the apartment flooded with natural light. The apartment is has an easy commute to MSNBC's studios in Rockefeller Center, and it seems fitting that it should be on the city's West side as that is where his mother has always lived.","Mia Farrow's son will launch his new show on February 24 .

For someone with a history of anxiety, a career in reality television might seem inadvisable. But for The Only Way Is Essex star Kirk Norcross, appearing in the Bafta-winning series helped him finally confront his mental health problems. After watching his reality-show colleagues talking about his split from girlfriend and co-star Lauren Pope, Kirk suffered the latest in a string of full-blown panic attacks – and knew he had to seek help. ‘In one episode of the last series the cast had all gone to Marbella without me and Lauren was saying rude things about me and our break-up,’ recalls the 25-year-old. ‘Suddenly, I couldn’t breathe. I must have blacked out because the next thing I knew, I was slumped on the sofa and the show was over.’ Chronic anxiety – a psychological condition that often causes panic attacks – affects one in six adults. Kirk has had the problem since childhood, but when his episodes increased in number and severity, he sought a diagnosis. ‘Being on TV brought out all my insecurities and paranoia,’ he explains. ‘A panic attack always starts with feeling like someone is trying to belittle me.’ Other recent attacks have been brought on after reading derogatory comments about himself on social media sites such as Twitter. ‘I feel trapped and crushed and small – it’s like a tiny tennis ball is in the middle of my chest and getting bigger and bigger,’ he reveals. ‘My breaths get shorter. Then I think I’m going red and everyone can notice, and my hands start tingling. I go dizzy and light-headed and think I’m going to have a heart attack, pass out or die.’ Anxiety pervades Kirk’s everyday life. During our interview, he fidgets constantly, and he talks so quickly that the words tumble over each other. In contrast, on TOWIE he comes across as a brash, flash, ladies’ man. But the brashness, he says, is all an act, and harks back to his teenage years when he would intentionally seek confrontation. ‘At times I knew a panic attack was coming and the only way to relieve it was to shout at the person putting me in that position. It often ended in a fight.’ On-screen style: Kirk never showed his anxiety to costars Billie and Sam Faiers, left and far right, and Lauren Goodger, but kept a confident front . That instinct – to fight – is one of two classic responses. The other – flight – is more common. ‘Adrenaline is a hormone that evolved in humans to help us fend off danger, either by attacking or running away fast,’ explains psychotherapist Matthew Stinson. Adrenaline causes the blood pressure to rise, the heart to beat faster and superficial blood vessels to constrict, thus preparing the body for action. ‘The problem with anxiety disorders is that the same hormonal response to physical danger arises in situations that are not dangerous,’ adds Stinson. The disorder is usually fuelled by a ‘storm’ of anxious thoughts. ‘Sufferers have an initial panicky feeling, which triggers adrenaline release. In turn, this prompts a physical reaction such as sweating or palpitations, which then alerts them that something alarming is going on, and it makes them panic more,’ says Stinson. Trigger: Kirk suffered a panic attack when ex Lauren Pope discussed their breakup on the show . ‘They can then feel out of control, terrified about what’s happening to their mind and body, and the panic escalates.’ The good news is that there are plenty of ways to manage, prevent and overcome such attacks. ‘The trick,’ says Stinson, ‘is to identify anxiety in its earliest stage, challenge the thoughts provoking it, reassure yourself, and slow your breathing so the body stops thinking it’s in danger.’ With practice, many people can achieve . this transformation themselves, although others opt for psychotherapy, . particularly cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). This is the most . effective treatment as the therapist can teach sufferers how to halt the . downward spiral. Kirk . traces his problems to when his parents separated when he was five years . old. From then on, his main contact with his father was talking on the . telephone – something Kirk always found upsetting. ‘It sounds silly, . but I couldn’t talk to someone I couldn’t see in case they were laughing . at me.’ During adolescence, . Kirk’s anxieties spread, and he suffered his first panic attack, aged . 18, in a clothes shop. ‘I went to return an item and the assistant said, . “Sorry, you need the receipt.” I felt everyone was looking at me. I . went bright red, started panicking, and ran out. I still can’t return . clothes – I have a wardrobe full of things that don’t fit.’ Another . trigger came when he started doing personal appearances as TOWIE’s . popularity grew – standing in front of a club full of people filled him . with dread. Eventually, Kirk sought help through a CBT therapist. ‘I only went four times but he made me visualise crowds giving me a positive reception. He taught me to slow down my breathing and, even if I feel scared, to grab the bull by the horns and do it anyway. It really helped.’ Last year Kirk started playing the piano and also discovered another surprising pastime that helps keep him calm – baking. ‘I love it!’ he beams. Now with a clutch of coping mechanisms, Kirk feels his anxiety is nearly under control and is tired of hiding his problem. ‘I don’t want to put on a front any longer. I’ve had enough of pretending – it’s a prison.’ lEssex Boy: My Story, by Kirk Norcross, is published by Pan Macmillan, priced £12.99.","Reality star Kirk Norcross suffers from anxiety disorder and panic attacks .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 01:53 EST, 25 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 06:08 EST, 25 February 2014 . Former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych is wanted for ‘mass murder’ and is believed to have evaded security forces by fleeing the country in a helicopter during a three-day dash for freedom. While further evidence of his corrupt behaviour continues to surface from the incriminating documents found at his mansion, there have been a number of unconfirmed sightings. The most recent put him in Crimea – the only part of Ukraine where Russians make up the majority of the population – sparking extraordinary claims he was assisted out of the country by his neighbouring people. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Caught on camera: Former Ukranian president Viktor Yanukovych, who is a 'wanted man' is captured boarding a helicopter in an attempt to flee the country . The three-day chase began on Friday after the then-President signed an accord with the opposition brokered by diplomats from Russia, France, Poland and Germany to end the street battles in Kiev that left more than 80 people dead. By the time that thousands of police and paramilitary special forces pulled out of the capital, Yanukovych may already have fled. CCTV footage captured what appears to be the deposed leader wheeling a suitcase into a helicopter and fleeing like a terrorist on the run. Fugitive on the run: Former Ukrainian president jumped into this helicopter en route to Donetsk airport, but was unable to fly out of the country . Manhunt: Trucks drive past the scene where former Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych left Kiev in a helicopter moments before . He is believed to have left his residence outside Kiev, where Ukrainians have discovered a private zoo, mock galleon and a number of vintage cars that their taxes and the corruption he presided over helped to fund. Yanukovych was accompanied by his chief of staff Andrei Klyuyev, one of the men blamed by demonstrators for brutality against civilians during three months of protests, and were heading to Donetsk airport. Acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, who has been leading the hunt for the elusive statesman, wrote on Facebook that the former president was unsuccessful in leaving the country. ‘He and his security disembarked the helicopters and boarded two private Falcon-type aircraft. He tried to fly out [of the country],’ Mr Avakov wrote. ‘The border service prevented their take-off.’ Wanted man: Former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych is wanted by police over the 'mass murder' of his civilians . Yanukovych then allegedly went to a state residence in Donetsk, before leaving for Crimea late on Saturday night. Reports later surfaced that two of his closest allies, Viktor Pshonka, the prosecutor general, and Oleksandr Klimenko, the tax minister, escaped at the same airport, but only after a shootout between their bodyguards and border guards. ‘Having learnt about parliament’s decisions to appoint A V Turchynov as acting Ukrainian President...Yanukovych hurriedly left the private sanatorium for Belbek airport [outside Sevastopol],’ Mr Avakov’s Facebook post continued. ‘Yanukovych, without reaching Belbek airport, stopped at a private residence near Balaclava. He gathered his guards and asked who would continue accompanying him and who would stay here. ‘Some of the staff of the state guard directorate expressed their wish to stay here. Having said goodbye to them, Yanukovych passed an official document declining state guards. ‘With the remaining security personnel, Yanukovych, accompanied by A P Klyuyev, left in an unknown direction in three cars, having switched off all means of communication. Unrest: Smoke from exploding fireworks and fires billows into the night sky as anti-government protestors gather on the Independence Square last week . Aftermath: Independence Square following the anti-government protests in downtown Kiev, Ukraine, in which 82 people died . ‘I inform you as of this morning. A criminal case has been instituted on mass murder of peaceful citizens. Yanukovych and a number of other officials HAVE BEEN PUT ON THE WANTED LIST.’ There was mounting speculation that Yanukovych had already made his way to Russia, on a private yacht from Balaclava, or with the Russian Navy from Sevastopol. Back in Kiev, barricades of old furniture and car tyres remained in place on Independent Square, with smoke rising from camp fires among tents occupied by diehards vowing to stay until elections in May. The mood among the few hundred on the square was a mixture of fatigue, sorrow for the 82 people killed last week, and a sense of victory after three months of protests. A large video screen by the side of the stage was showing the faces of the dead, one after another, on a loop. But the carnage over the past week is only the start of the country’s problem, with Ukraine’s Finance Ministry revealing the nation urgently needs $35 billion in foreign aid. Acting President Oleksander Turchinov, appointed after Yanukovich was stripped of his powers by parliament on Saturday, said Ukraine was near default and the economy was falling into an abyss. 'Over the past two days, we have had consultations and meetings with the EU and U.S. ambassadors and other countries and financial institutions on the urgent delivery of macro-financial assistance for Ukraine,' Acting Finance Minister Yuri Kolobov said in a statement.

The daughter of musicians Ray Davies and Chrissie Hynde has been found guilty of disrupting fracking at an exploratory oil site - by supergluing herself to a fellow protester. Natalie Hynde, 31, and Simon Medhurst, 55, were today found guilty of disrupting energy firm Cuadrilla's test drilling plant during high-profile protests near Balcombe, West Sussex, last summer. Brighton Magistrates' Court heard the pair cost the firm around £5,000 through delaying deliveries for two hours after they superglued their hands together while Medhurst had his arm through the gate on July 31 last year. Natalie Hynde, the daughter of musicians Ray Davies and Chrissie Hynde has been found of disrupting fracking at an exploratory oil site - by supergluing herself to a fellow anti-fracking protester . Natalie Hynde and her friend Simon Medhurst glue themselves together during a demonstration outside the entrance of a drill site operated by Cuadrilla Resources Ltd in Balcombe, southern England . Prosecutor Jonathan Edwards told the trial that access was hampered and Cuadrilla staff and contractors were prevented from going about their 'legal right' to work there. Hynde said her intention was to gain publicity by creating a 'striking and symbolic' image to highlight concerns surrounding the controversial method of extracting natural gas from underground shale rock. And Medhurst - a veteran of . environmental campaigns including Newbury and the Hastings to Bexhill . link road - also said the intention was to gain widespread publicity . rather than obstructing Cuadrilla employees. But . finding the pair guilty, district judge William Ashworth said their . protest 'went beyond reasonable freedom of speech' as it disrupted . access to the site for two hours. The . district judge told Medhurst and Hynde: 'I'm sure that you did beset, . in the true meaning of the word, the Cuadrilla site by locking . yourselves around the gate and thereby controlling access to the site.' Hynde . told the court she took part in the 'peaceful, non-violent' direct . action around seven days after arriving at the Balcombe site in a bid to . galvanise public support against fracking. Hynde . said: 'The purpose of it was to create an image in the media that would . be striking and symbolic of the lock-the-gate process, and raise the . profile of fracking.' Brighton Magistrates' Court heard the pair cost the firm around £5,000 through delaying deliveries for two hours after they superglued their hands together . Finding the pair guilty, district judge William Ashworth said their protest 'went beyond reasonable freedom of speech' as it disrupted access to the site for two hours . 'That wasn't the intention. 'I didn't think that it would be possible for two people to delay in any meaningful way. It was for a snapshot, and hopefully get more interviews after that.' Under cross-examination from Mr Edwards, Hynde was asked whether, due to her famous parents, she would have gained just as much media exposure without supergluing herself to Medhurst. Confirming to the court who her parents are, Hynde went on: 'If you are saying that holding a placard is enough, then it isn't. I have done those things and I wanted to take it one step further.' Hynde, of St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, and Medhurst, of Hastings, had both denied a charge of 'besetting' the premises. But after being convicted, Hynde also pleaded guilty to trespassing on a railway bridge at Balcombe on August 18 last year. Hynde, a King's College, London, English Literature graduate, was given a concurrent 12-month conditional discharge, and ordered to pay costs of £400 and a £15 victim surcharge. Medhurst, who has three previous convictions, was fined £200, and told to pay costs of £200 and a victim surcharge cost of £20. The pair stood trial alongside three other defendants - Robert Basto, 65, of Reigate, Surrey, Jamie Spiers, 29, of no fixed address, and Nichola Sanger, 44, of Southsea, Hampshire, who also denied charges relating to the Balcombe protest. Basto was convicted of obstructing the highway and acquitted of obstructing a policeman, Sanger was cleared of besetting the site by blocking its entrance, and Spiers will be dealt with later after he failed to attend court today.","Natalie Hynde, 31, and Simon Medhurst, .

River Phoenix, (centre), in the film 'Dark Blood with Judy Davis (left) and Jonathan Pryce (right) Due to River Phoenix's sudden death, shooting was never finished. Director George Sluizer read scenes from the script as a narration as part of the final cut . The film is the only one of Phoenix's where the star, brother of Joaquin Phoenix, portrayed a villain . He managed to get hold of the film and ship it to Europe where, 20 years later, he has finished the film and is prepared to screen it. He said: 'It was going to be burnt two days later by the insurance company after it lost a lawsuit with the family of River Phoenix.' He will discuss his recently-completed film the last to feature the promising star, which he shot shortly before his death in 1993, the Independent reported. He completed the film last month, voicing over the scenes from the screenplay that Phoenix never filmed. But the final work is still missing some scenes and has about 25 per cent missing. The director completed the film in 2012 and premiered it at the Berlin Film Festival. In the film Dark Blood, Phoenix plays a character called Boy who is a young widower who retreats into the desert to live a reclusive life .

Boy saves a stranded couple on their second honeymoon, only to keep them hostage as he falls in love with the female lead character played by Judy Davis. It has never been released on DVD because of an ongoing legal battle, so only a handful of people will be able to watch it.","Dutch director George Sluizer had completed four-fifths of the film at the time of the young actor, who had a leading role, passing .

She was little more than 24 hours away from death and, in hindsight, the normally bubbly personality of vivacious Charlotte Dawson was subdued. Not that Channel Nine Mornings hosts Sonia Kruger and David Campbell could have imagined that it was the last time they would see their regular Mornings show guest alive. '[Looking back] I thought she seemed a bit more subdued than normal,' Kruger told the MailOnline. 'Normally she would be entertaining everybody from the get go.' Scroll down for video . Looking back, Mornings co-host Sonia Kruger realised Dawson (pictured above, on her last ever TV appearance) was 'a bit more subdued than normal' David Campbell and Sonia Kruger say Dawson sat back during her final appearance on TV, from her usually more forthright, funny and 'brutally honest' persona . 'She was kind of sitting back and letting the other guys take the lead. I just thought she seemed a little quieter than normal.' Dawson arrived at the Nine Network studios between 7.30 and 8am last Friday for hair and make-up, ahead of her appearance on a Mornings segment to discuss the tenth anniversary of the hit television show, Sex and the City. By 9.10am, Dawson was sitting in the studio waiting for the segment to go ahead. The ensuing performance by the seasoned on-air performer would later have Kruger and Campbell - in their grief the next day after learning of her fate - in an intense discussion about Dawson's demeanour during her television appearance. What was to be Dawson's last ever interview, was ostensibly just a spot on Mornings, to which Dawson had been contracted for the last two years. Dawson brightened up and engaged in the discussion about Sex and the City's message for women viewers, but she was a shadow of her usual self, Sonia Kruger believes . After Dawson's final appearance (above) on Channel Nine's Mornings show, hosts David Campbell and Sonia Kruger say her death has 'saddened' and 'blindsided' the network . Her humour still intact, Charlotte Dawson gave David Campbell one final ribbing in her usual 'affectionate' style . With decades of experience appearing on the network's fashion, sports, lifestyle and news programmes, Dawson was a popular member of Nine's 'television family'. 'She was always laughing and hanging around with Dickie [Channel Nine entertainment reporter, Richard Wilkins] in his room,' Campbell said. He said Mornings' producers had regularly chosen Charlotte for her always entertaining, forthright opinions and her fearless 'jousting' with other guests, such as British TV reality contestant, Katie Hopkins, whose views on immigration has seen her labelled a racist. '[Charlotte's] so great,' Campbell said. 'Her opinions are so valid. She's so funny. She had such experience. She would have a go. She was always having a go at me, in an affectionate, endearing way. 'That was one of her charms. There was nothing nasty about Charlotte. She was brutally honest, and that was one of the things that was so endearing about her. I enjoyed it.' Dawson was to have one final 'go' at Campbell. Before the segment, Dawson had posted on Instagram a photo of herself, joking 'About to go on @mornings9 to talk sex. As you can see I'm racking my brains and have gone blank'. Overwhelmed: Nine's Mondays show hosts Sonia Kruger and David Campbell paid tribute to Charlotte Dawson, having friend Alex Perry (pictured, above, with Dawson) on Monday's show, but found it overwhelming that Dawson had been in the studio last Friday and 'now would never be there again' Seated on the Mornings couch with Gretel Killeen, to debate whether  Sex and the City had empowered or damaged women, Dawson seemed relaxed and soon displayed her trademark energy. It was only to Kruger, and only, later, on reflection to Campbell, that there was any a sense of something being awry with her. A lively discuss ensued, during which Campbell remarked, 'it's just a TV show', to which Dawson, pointing at him, said, 'you loved it more than anyone'. 'Then she left,' Campbell said. 'I don't remember it being anything you could read something into. It was a simple 'see you guys later'.' The next morning Sonia Kruger was in the Eastern Suburbs going about 'a normal Saturday' when the Mornings executive producer called her. It was minutes before the story would break in the media. In Adelaide, David Campbell was backstage at Westfield preparing to take part in a pantomime, when someone told him the news. 'It was such a shock. It took the wind out of my sails, but I had to go on.' When both presenters arrived at the Nine Network on Monday morning, Campbell said 'a sad vibe lay across the whole network'. 'It's pretty raw. We were all aware of her depression. She would talk about it, use it as a punchline. We thought she might have been a bit quieter than usual, but you don't see anything like that coming. 'It really blindsided everybody.' With help from their producers, Kruger and Campbell prepared a Mornings tribute for 'funny, warm, maternal' Dawson, consummate TV professional and 'caring friend'. 'We report on a lot of stories,' Campbell said, 'but it was one of the hardest things. I just found it confronting, almost overwhelming, that last Friday she was here and she will never be again.'","Charlotte Dawson was 'quieter than normal' in last ever TV interview .

In the end, it appears that Charlotte Dawson had grown tired of fighting a battle against depression that became increasingly difficult and impossible to win. Close friend, designer Alex Perry spoke to News Corp about how even Dawson's abundant energy and humour could not overcome the crippling mental disease which had seen her hospitalised twice in a year. 'She was a very tormented woman and really was finding it hard to battle her mental illness,' said Perry, who worked with Dawson when they were judges on Australia's Next Top Model. Friends despaired: Dawson, pictured with Alex Perry (left) and Sydney journalist Melissa Hoyer and (right) with Perry, found it increasingly difficult as she got older to win her never-ending battle with crippling depression . Goodbye, beautiful girl: Friends of Dawson (right, pictured with Top Model judge Alex Perry) watched on as she fought a losing battle with depression, which became 'harder as she got older' 'I just can’t believe she has taken her own life but . . . it was such a battle and as she got older it was harder to deal with.' 'Mental illness just made it so difficult for her to really go in so many parts of her life.' 'She obviously has tried and tried so hard to raise awareness of mental illness but it really did just totally take its toll and got on top of her.' Final tweets: In the days before she died, Dawson reached out to people suffering because they could not afford life saving cancer surgery because of health budget cutbacks . Support: Model Lara Bingle (pictured left with Dawson) has sent a message of support following the 47-year-old's death after being reported by friends as being in 'terrible' emotional shape . Ms Dawson's manager, Mark Byrne, also spoke about how she had strived to hide the debilitating disease from people for years. 'Her illness was painful and well hidden until it could not be,' he told news.com.au, 'but I will miss and remember Charlotte for her energy and fun and I celebrate her legacy and amazing contribution to industry and charity. 'She is now one of Australia’s historical media figures pioneering our now booming celebrity entertainment and media industries. 'Personally she was a mentor, a loyal friend, a client and great mate; above all Charlotte was a lot of fun. Each memory is full of laughs.' Last days: Caring to the end, Charlotte Dawson (pictured near her apartment two days before she was found dead) sent messages of support via Twitter to people who were suffering . Ms Dawson's mental battles were epitomised by the tussle between her fragile self image and her desire to a be a strong woman. In an interview with Who Weekly, Dawson admitted to extensive plastic surgery, including having an eye lift, a breast operation, Botox, fillers and fat transfer procedure. But she also said she believed the media’s relationship with body image was becoming increasingly destructive and young woman, such as the entrants of the Top Model competition, needed to remember they were role models. 'There are two things that disturb me — the extent of the procedures that young, beautiful girls are having and that some of them are doing it for publicity,' she said. 'They need to remember they have young fans who are 12 and 13.' Ms Dawson's last days before the constant tweeter fell into an ominous Twitter silence, included posts of support to people who were suffering in hospital from terminal cancer. A Twitter debate two days before she died centred on health budget cuts and how the lack of available surgeons for cancer sufferers in the public hospital system meant people were dying. 'We have hospitals/resources & the doctors and resources & the professors willing to help. Where is the support?' she tweeted on Thursday. She added that life saving cancer surgeries were unable to proceed because they were underfunded by the public purse. She wrote about one woman's 'horrific' plight with cancer and the she was 'facing the toughest challenge'. She ended the tweet with 'send her love' and an emoticon heart.","'She tried so hard, but it got on top of her', designer friend Perry says .

Murder: Crimewatch presenter Jill Dando was killed on her doorstep with a single bullet to the head - and today a gang of Serbian assassins has been linked to her killing . A team of Serbian security agents who held top positions in the hated regime of Slobodan Milosevic have today been linked with the unsolved murder of Jill Dando. In a bizarre claim made today, it is said the tyrant held a grudge against the BBC presenter because she made a successful TV appeal to get help for the millions of Kosovan refugees displaced by his murderous regime. The four men accused of being involved are wanted over a string of political murders in their home country. A widow of one of their alleged victims said Miss Dando's execution in April 1999 has all the hallmarks of her own husband's murder, which was two weeks earlier. Miss Dando, 37, was shot once in the head outside her home in Fulham, south west London, on April 26, 1999. Neighbours found her slumped against her front door in a pool of blood. The crime shocked Britain and has not been solved, after Barry George was acquitted after eight years in prison. The Serbian connection has been made repeatedly in the years since her death, but never proven. He was cleared after two trials and two appeals after a jury accepted the evidence was 'thin' and he lacked the IQ and expertise to carry out what was called the 'perfect murder'. Serbian historian Branka Prpa was with her husband, Slavko Curuvija when he was shot dead . outside their home in Belgrade on April 11, 1999 - 15 days before Miss . Dando was killed outside her home in Fulham, west London. She believes that the same people who killed her husband came to London to kill Miss Dando. However, senior Scotland Yard sources said there was 'not a shred of evidence' that Miss Dando killed by Serb assassin. She told the Daily Mirror: . 'Considering the fact that it is absolutely clear the security service . committed my husband’s murder, I believe those are the people that could . be involved in the murder of Jill Dando. 'The ­methodology of the shootings is the same. It is very possible and is not unrealistic that this is the work of the . same people.' The suspects in his murder have been named as Radomir Markovic, Milan Radonjic, Ratko Romic and Miroslav Kurak. Suspects: Rade Markovic is already in prison for 40 years for the murder of a former president. Slobodan Milosevic (right) was said to hold a grudge against the BBC presenter . Held: Ratko Romi, a former security chief, and Milan Radonjic were both arrested and are in custody . Fourth man: Miroslav Kurak is said to be in east Africa and is set to face an international arrest warrant to get him back to Serbia, according to reports . Similarities? Murdered Serbian media publisher Slavko Curuvija,  right, walks hand-in-hand with wife, historian Branka Prpa,  Belgrade, shortly before he was murdered on April 11, 1999.  Curuvija was one of the leading critics of then-Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic. During the police investigation into Jill Dando's murder, Barry George was the number one suspect. But in the year before he was arrested many theories emerged. The first was that her killing was ordered by a vengeful underworld Mr Big, jailed after one of her Crimewatch programmes. The manner in which she was killed, a single shot to the head, is the hallmark of an assassin and added to that theory. Another was that she was killed by jealous ex-lover. Miss Dando was engaged to Dr Alan Farthing, who helped deliver Prince George last year. It was alleged that a former lover may have ordered her killing to stop their marriage but Scotland Yard have ruled out past boyfriends as suspects. But the link to Serbia has repeatedly come up, because warlord Milosevic was upset she had made an appeal for Kosovan refugees.The suspects have been named as Radomir Markovic, Milan Radonjic, Ratko Romic and Miroslav Kurak. Markovic is the former head of the Serbian National Security Service, known as DB and serving 40 years for the murder of former Serb president Ivan Stambolic. Radonjic and Romic, who are both former DB chiefs, were arrested last month in connection with Slavko's death. Kurak also belonged to the DB. He left Serbia more than a decade ago and is understood to be in Tanzania, East Africa. Officials are in the process of applying for an international warrant for his arrest.

Ms Prpa has also pointed to a range of . similarities between Miss Dando’s murder outside her West London home and that of her husband. Both were high-profile journalists who were returning home when they were assaulted, then shot in the head. There has been a long-running link between Serbia and Miss Dando's murder. In the immediate aftermath of the 1999 killing an . anonymous caller phoned the BBC claiming he had killed the Crimewatch . presenter over Nato action in the former Yugoslavia . The . mystery caller phoned then head of news Tony Hall claiming . responsibility for the shooting and told him he would be next, it was revealed in confidential BBC . papers. Barry Lindsey said Miss Dando was confronted by her 'Mediterranean' killer on her doorstep in 1999 seconds before she was killed. Mr Lindsey told detectives to search for an olive-skinned man - but he claims they were only interested in evidence linking Barry George to the murder. Mr George served eight years behind bars for the killing before being acquitted after a retrial in 2008. The jury took less than two days to return a not guilty verdict. He was denied up to £500,000 compensation for being wrongly jailed after the Court of Appeal agreed with a minister that Mr George was 'not innocent enough' to be eligible for a pay-off.

A man was seen by several . neighbours in the moments after the murder but he has never been traced . Murder scene: Police officers cordon off Jill Dando's road in Fulham, south London, following the shooting in April 1999 . Mugshot: Police and the CPS managed to get Barry George convicted in 2001 but eight years later he was cleared . 'Misfit' Barry George left court a free man in 2008, having endured two trials and two appeals in the battle to prove his innocence after being wrongly jailed for the murder of Jill Dando. Nine years after the shooting of the TV presenter on her own doorstep, and seven years after George was convicted of the crime, an Old Bailey jury took less than two days to acquit him. Miss Dando's family have for years faced the grim probability that her murder will never be solved as a result. At the first trial in 2001, the case against George - who lived 500 yards from Miss Dando's home in Gowan Avenue - was regarded by some as 'thin'. Yet the jury voted 10-1 that George was guilty of murder. A year after he was jailed, the Appeal Court comprehensively dismissed his appeal. In a 58-page ruling, judges said the trial had been fair and there remained a compelling case against George . But doubts about his guilt continued, and his sister Michelle Diskin mounted a campaign for justice. Last November three other Appeal Court judges questioned the value of the forensic evidence which helped convict him. The judges, led by Lord Phillips, said the jury might have reached a different verdict had they known of doubts about crucial gunshot evidence. In 2001, the Old Bailey had been told that a microscopic speck of firearms discharge residue, found in a pocket of George's coat, was linked to particles found in Miss Dando's hair and clothes. But scientists said the particle was worthless as evidence. It was just as likely that it came from innocent contamination in a police lab or from the general 'environment' as from the murder weapon, and a new trial was ordered. Before the second prosecution, George's legal team - led by William Clegg QC - successfully argued that the firearms evidence should not be heard by the jury. Detectives carried out a full forensic review of the evidence using scientific methods not available for the first trial. They uncovered suspicious blood spots on his clothes but hopes of a direct forensic links between George and Miss Dando were dashed when they turned out to be from George himself. The prosecution then faced an uphill battle. No weapon has ever been found, there were no witnesses to the killing, and no obvious compelling motive. But because of a change in the law, they were able to use so-called 'bad character' evidence and a series of women gave evidence about how George 'terrified' and 'intimidated' them in the street during the 1990s. Photo: An image of Mr George wearing a gas mask and holding a starting pistol emerged but a jury accepted he had neither the experience nor intellect to carry out the perfect crime . George was portrayed as a celebrity-obsessed stalker who secretly took thousands of photographs of women and had a fascination with female TV presenters. Police found 2,248 photographs of women in his home, as well as a gun holster, a list of guns and military magazines. There was also a picture of George wearing a gas mask and holding a starting pistol - the sort of weapon, said the prosecution, that if converted could have fired the fatal shot. However, the jury of eight women and four men were not told that George had been convicted of attempted rape. Nor that he was arrested by police in 1983 - dressed in combat gear, carrying a length of rope and a knife - hiding in bushes outside Kensington Palace in an attempt to see Diana, Princess of Wales. George did not give evidence during his retrial. His barrister argued that he did not have the motive or the expertise to do what many people may think was 'the perfect crime'. William Clegg described his client's intellect as being comparable to a '40-watt bulb'. Eventually Barry, 53, did indeed walk free as an innocent man, after he was acquitted on August 1 2008.","Four men face questions in Serbia over series of political assassinations .

A report published on a newspaper website said that the chief veterinary officer for Poland compiled a 30-page report after a formal visit by inspectors to Irish plants implicated in the horsemeat scandal. Rotting and destined for burgers: Photograph showing meat detained at the Irish burger manufacturer . The meat processor said the meat had deteriorated while being moved and unpacked for testing . It states that rotten meat was found at the giant Silvercrest factory in Co. Monaghan.  The report contained photographs of the spoiled meat. Polish investigators claim, according to the Guardian, it was destined for burgers but must have been unfit for human consumption all along. ‘What I saw was clearly unfit for human consumption. It was part of a bigger consignment but I was told the rest of it had already been used,’ inspector Katarzyna Piskorz said. A report states that rotten meat was found at the giant Silvercrest factory in Co. Monaghan . ‘I asked why the factory managers had not noticed the state of it, but was told they had not seen any problem.’ The Polish report explains how inspectors examined eight pallets of meat from a delivery of 22 pallets that had been destined for burger production. ABP told the newspaper the meat and its packaging had deteriorated as it had been stored in a refrigerated lorry for three weeks under quarantine conditions – rather than those for meat intended for the food chain. The meat processor said the meat had deteriorated while being moved and unpacked for testing. All the meat arriving at the factory had the correct documents on arrival and would have been tested, it said. ABP insisted none of the meat in the consignment had left its plant or entered the food chain.","Rotten meat 'was found at the giant Silvercrest factory in Co. Monaghan'

Virginia senator Steve Martin has described women as being merely 'hosts' for their unborn babies, in an anti-abortion Facebook rant that will do little to court his female fan base. The Republican went on to claim women should not have the right to end their pregnancies in an angry response to a note from pro-choice advocates on Valentine's Day. 'I don't expect to be in the room or will I do anything to prevent you from obtaining a contraceptive,' Martin wrote. 'However, once a child does exist in your womb, I'm not going to assume a right to kill it just because the child's host (some refer to them as mothers) doesn't want it.' Hosts: Virginia senator Steve Martin, pictured at a rally in 2008, has described women as being merely 'hosts' for their unborn babies, in an anti-abortion Facebook rant . Martin, the former chairman of the Senate Education and Health Committee, voted for Virginia's mandatory ultrasound bill and supported a fetal personhood bill, which would ban all abortions and could affect the legality of some forms of contraception. His state's Pro-Choice Coalition wrote in the generic card that they were disappointed, on behalf of women's health advocates across Virginia, with his choice to vote for such bills. 'All women deserve access to their full range of reproductive health options - including preventing unintentional pregnancies, raising healthy children, and choosing safe, legal abortion - and your votes only make it more difficult for Virginians to plan and provide for their families,' the note went on. Offensive: The degrading reference to pregnant women as hosts sparked outrage and he later changed it to the not much better phrase, 'bearer of the child' It then concluded: 'Please don't break our hearts.' But Martin snapped back, with a lengthy post on the social media website about where women could stick their reproductive health options. 'If it's your expectation that I should support such nonsense, I will be breaking your heart,' he wrote before referring to the pro-choice group as 'really sick people.' The post, originally shared on February 17, received nearly 100 likes. However, the degrading reference to pregnant women as hosts sparked outrage on Twitter, with many accusing Martin of waging war on women and some women posting pictures of themselves with signs stating 'I am a person.' In response, Martin changed the word 'host' to the not much better 'bearer of the child' though he retained the charming '(some refer to them as mothers)' for good measure.","Senator Steve Martin went on to claim women should not have the right to end their pregnancies in an angry response to a Valentine's Day card from pro-choice advocates .

Companies which bombard the public with spam text messages, silent phone calls and junk emails could escape prosecution because of a legal ruling, the privacy watchdog warned last night. Christopher Graham, the Information Commissioner, said the deluge of unsolicited material was ‘one of the great curses of the age’ which he was increasingly powerless to stop. His warning follows a court case in which a judge ruled a company could not be fined hundreds of thousands of pounds despite bombarding phone users with millions of text messages over three years. Companies which bombard the public with spam text messages, silent phone calls and junk emails could escape prosecution because of a legal ruling, the privacy watchdog warned last night . Tetrus Telecoms was originally fined £440,000 but won on appeal after a tribunal ruled the text messages were only a minor nuisance and did not cause ‘substantial damage and distress’. Mr Graham said: ‘We could show there was nuisance - that isn’t enough apparently’ - as he called for the law to be changed. ‘We have just got to lower that hurdle because I think if you ask most people they would say silent calls and unsolicited spam texts are one of the great curses of the age - and if the Information Commissioner can’t protect you it’s a poor lookout.’ Experts suggest the ruling makes it hugely difficult, if not impossible for the Information Commissioner’s Office - the watchdog charged with protecting the public against the tidal wave of junk - to issue fines. The Commissioner said the public were worried about the growth of the NHS care.data programme which was designed to harvest patients¿ data on a huge database . Ministers have suggested they could pass a new law, and Mr Graham is appealing the ruling - but until the legal position is clarified there are few deterrents for companies issuing spam messages. The fine was first handed down in November 2012 against two men, Christopher Niebel and Gary McNeish. Niebel, who was hit with the bulk of the fine, appealed and won. An ICO probe found their firm was . sending huge volumes of text messages from offices in Stockport and . Birmingham without phone users’ consent and in breach of the law. The . company made huge profits of around £8,000 a day from passing on . personal details of anyone who responded to messages calling on them to . make a legal claim following an accident or if they had been mis-sold . Payment Protection Insurance. An . ICO spokesman said the judgment was ‘disappointing’. He said: ‘The . public is clear that it wants to see a stop put to nuisance text . messages. The fines we issue help to achieve that, and if we are . prevented from issuing fines then it’s fair to expect that the public . will receive more of these messages. Mr Graham said the public were much more concerned about privacy concerns than the stories about data collection by the security services gleaned from secret files stolen by Edward Snowden (pictured) ‘This is another reminder of why we’re pushing for a change in the law to make it easier for us to issue penalties.’ Mr Graham also said the public were very concerned about the growth of the NHS care.data programme which was designed to harvest patients’ data on a huge database. The project was put on hold for six months last week following privacy concerns. In an interview with the Independent Mr Graham said the public were much more concerned about that issue than the stories about data collection by the security services gleaned from secret files stolen by Edward Snowden. Mr Graham said: ‘People have been challenging me on the bus about care. data. That’s the talking point but Snowden hasn’t been, which is kind of a surprise.’ He criticised the NHS’s efforts to explain the care.data system - which included leaflets sent to households in England and not a personalised letter as he advised. ‘They said ""No, we’re going to do a leaflet."" I never received my leaflet,' he said.","Information Commissioner says unsolicited material is a 'great curse'

The Tories are to rebrand themselves as the ‘Workers’ Party’ and revive Sir John Major’s mission to make Britain a ‘classless society’. The party’s chairman Grant Shapps, appearing alongside the former prime minister, will today insist that the Tories are ‘not here to defend privilege but to spread it’. Mr Shapps will argue that the Government has a ‘bigger and more positive story to tell’ than one of austerity and bringing the public finances back towards sanity, seeking to reclaim the blue-collar conservatism that delivered Commons majorities to Sir John and Baroness Thatcher. Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps will hail Sir John Major's upbringing in the backstreets of Brixton as a 'symbol' of the Tory party . Mr Shapps will declare: ‘The Conservatives are the Workers’ Party and we are on your side.' In remarks that risk drawing comparisons with David Cameron’s upper middle class upbringing, the Tory chairman will say that Sir John’s journey from the backstreets of Brixton to Downing Street ‘is a symbol of our party’. ‘Sir John Major campaigned for what he called a “classless society”, and I would argue this is the society we are fighting for in Government today: a Britain where it doesn’t matter who your parents are, where you can go as far as your talents and hard work will take you, and where work – rather than benefits – is what pays,’ Mr Shapps will add. The Tory chairman will also unveil a five-point ‘pledge card’ – an echo of one deployed by Tony Blair in 1997 – setting out the Tories’ ‘long-term economic plan’ that will be at the heart of its 2015 election campaign. It includes reducing the deficit; cutting income tax and freezing fuel duty; creating more jobs by backing small business; capping welfare and reducing immigration; and delivering the best schools and skills for young people. There has been growing anxiety among Tory MPs about the collapse in support for the party in Scotland, much of the north of England and among ethnic minorities. Though Mr Cameron still easily outpolls his party and Labour leader Ed Miliband, vanishingly few voters regard him as ‘in touch’ with the concerns of ordinary voters. Jon Ashworth, Labour’s shadow Cabinet . Office minister, said: 'You can't pose as the ""workers' party"" when . you've made working people £1,600 worse off while cutting taxes for the . wealthiest. 'Asking . John Major for help is just a reminder that he was the last Tory leader . to win an election - and that Tory MPs don't believe they can win under . David Cameron. With David Cameron's record as leader they'd be better . off renaming themselves the millionaires' party.' Sir John grew up in a small house in Coldhabour Lane in Brixton in the 1950s, in contrast to the privileged upbringing of many in the Tory leadership . Blue collar Conservatives have . insisted the party needs to reclaim its traditional mantle as the party . for the hardworking lower middle class – calling for hikes in the . minimum wage and further increases in the income tax allowance. It has already been increased to £10,000, saving 24 million basic rate taxpayers more than £700 a year. One . prominent MP, Robert Halfon, is even suggesting the Conservative party . should formally rename itself the ‘Workers’ Party’ and replace its green . oak tree logo with a ladder, to symbolise its commitment to promoting . social mobility. ‘To win . back support, radical change is needed in the very nature of the . Conservative Party,’ he said. ‘Let’s value public sector workers — . nurses, doctors, police and teachers — millions of whom put service . above self. ‘Let’s support . working people by strengthening the minimum wage and fight for a living . wage — achieved through further tax cuts for lower earners,’ Mr Halfon . said. Personal touch: David Cameron yesterday met workers at a BP oil platform in the North Sea, around 100 miles east of Aberdeen, as he faced calls to change the Tories' image . Mr Shapps, making the first major . speech to be delivered at the new Tory HQ in Westminster, will agree . that the party needs to flesh out ‘our mission; what a Conservative . majority would really mean for people’. ‘We . are the party on the side of the whole nation. We are the party on the . side of working people. Our politics isn't about a list of statistics . and numbers. There is a moral purpose to it, a mission. ‘Imagine . a young kid growing up in inner city London – just a few miles from . here. His mum and dad are working, but not very rich, trying to pay the . bills. Tory MP Robert Halfon suggested the Tories should replace their tree logo with a ladder to symbolise its commitment to promoting social mobility . ‘This young man was not particularly academic. He quit school at 16 and struggled to get on. So let me ask you something: what did the Conservative Party have to offer someone like that? ‘I’ll tell you. That young man’s name is John Major, and the Conservative Party made him Prime Minister… His life is a symbol of our party. It shows whose side we are on.’ Mr Shapps will insist the Government’s record to date demonstrates its core purpose, highlighting jobs figures showing that more than 30 million people are now in work and nine out of ten new jobs going to British people. ‘We are helping hardworking people to be more financially secure, meaning more people have the security of a pay packet and parents can plan better for their children’s future,’ he will add. The Tory chairman will insist much more could be achieved with a majority Conservative government after 2015, including a ‘recovery in wages, a recovery in jobs, where you don’t just see the recovery in the stock market, but you feel it in your pay-packet as well’. Mr Shapps will insist the ‘worst cliché in politics’ is that there is ‘no choice’ between the parties, saying it is now clear there is a ‘huge difference’. ‘We have to make that argument: Labour would go back to the same old policies that got us in this mess in the first place - more spending, more borrowing, more taxes. ‘This shows us something simple. If . you are an apprentice, if you work, if you run a business; Labour's not . on your side – but the Conservatives are. ‘If you drive a car, if you have a mortgage, if you pay Council Tax; Labour's not on your side – but the Conservatives are. ‘If . you have children,  if you want rigorous standards in school, if you . want your children to learn the skills of the future; Labour's not on . your side – but the Conservatives are.’ He will also urge employers to take on more young apprentices and trainees, and unveil a new ‘John Major Apprenticeship Programme’ giving young people who have not been to university the chance to take a first step on the Westminster career ladder. Yesterday Downing Street brushed off complaints from one unnamed Tory MP that Mr Cameron's inner-circle was still too elitist. ‘There are six people writing the manifesto and five of them went to Eton; the other went to St Paul’s,’ the MP said. But Pauline Latham, the MP for Mid-Derbyshire, agreed that Mr Cameron tends to surround himself with ‘people who are like him’. ‘I am sure he listens to Samantha Cameron a lot but he is never going to listen to me. Everything is looked at through the prism of London, by people from London. We should have regional input’.","Tory chairman Grant Shapps to recast Conservatives as 'Workers' Party'

Fall: Sales of British block cheeses such as Cheddar, Lancashire and Wensleydale are plummeting . Sales of traditional cheeses such as Cheddar, Lancashire and Wensleydale are plummeting, it has been revealed. During 2013, sales of Cheddar fell by more than 5 per cent, while demand for other regional varieties was down by 10 per cent or more. Price rises and increased availability of foreign varieties are thought to behind the drop in sales of British block cheese. The price of almost all cheese has shot up due to low levels of milk production in the first half of 2013 and increased worldwide demand for dairy products, especially in the Far East. Regional British cheeses are usually sold . only in blocks that can cost up to £4, but foreign cheeses such as brie . and camembert can be a cheaper option because they are sold in smaller . sizes, perhaps costing about £2. Industry insiders say tightened household budgets could also be behind the fall in sales of British block cheese. But sales of lower-fat cheese are also . booming, say analysts Nielsen. Low-fat sales topped £70million for the . first time last year as demand went up 5.6 per cent to 9,800 tons. Some lighter varieties of cheese, such as Cheddar, contain about 22 per cent fat compared with 35 per cent for standard cheddar.

Foreign cheeses such as brie (pictured) can also be a cheaper option because they are sold in smaller sizes . Alastair Jackson, marketing manager of cheese maker Adams Foods, said: 'Shoppers are switching from full-fat to reduced-fat cheeses, but trading up half-fat varieties.' Improved recipes, better taste and more prominence on supermarket shelves are believed to have buoyed the market for lighter cheese.

Overweight: Around a third of teenagers are now heavier than is recommended for their health, the World Health Organisation has said . Being overweight is so common in Europe that it risks becoming 'the new norm', with around a third of teenagers now heavier than is recommended for their health, the World Health Organisation has said. In a report on obesity levels in the 53 countries of the organisation's European Region, the United Nations health agency said up to 27 per cent of 13-year-olds and 33 per cent of 11-year-olds are overweight. 'Our perception of what is normal has shifted; being overweight is now more common than unusual. We must not let another generation grow up with obesity as the new norm,' said Zsuzsanna Jakab, the World Health Organisation's (WHO) regional director. She blamed a combination of high levels of physical inactivity, coupled with a culture that promotes cheap, convenient foods high in sugars, fats and salt. This combination, she said, 'is deadly'. Obesity rates among 11-year-old boys and girls were highest in Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain, and lowest in the Netherlands and Switzerland, the report found. Lack of exercise is a key part of the problem. In 23 out of 36 countries, more than 30 per cent of boys and girls aged 15 and over are not getting enough exercise. Among adults, rates of women who don't engage in enough physical activity range from 16 percent in Greece and 17 per cent in Estonia to 71 per cent in Malta and 76 per cent in Serbia. The WHO recommends children aged five to 17 should get at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity a day, and adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week. Joao Breda, a WHO expert on nutrition, physical activity and obesity, said peoples' living environments - including the layout of town, cities, schools and workplaces - are crucial to increasing rates of exercise.

'We need to create environments where physical activity is encouraged and the healthy food choice is the default choice, regardless of social group,' he said in a statement released with the report. 'Physical activity and healthy food choices should be taken very seriously in all environments - schools, hospitals, cities, towns and workplaces. As well as the food industry, the urban planning sector can make a difference,' he added. The WHO report found, however, that some countries, including France and some Scandinavian countries, have managed to contain the obesity epidemic 'through a whole-of-government approach'. It said many policies in these countries - such as promoting vegetable and fruit consumption in schools, taxing certain foods to reduce intake, controlling advertising, employing good surveillance and monitoring, and taking action to promote physical activity - had combined to help keep obesity levels stable.","A third of teens are overweight, according to the World Health Organisation .

Tory MP Peter Bone's constituency home was raided by police last year . A Conservative MP was questioned by police over an alleged benefits fraud, it emerged last night. Peter . Bone's home was raided by police as part of a year-long inquiry into . whether his elderly mother-in-law’s assets were deliberately concealed . during her time in a care home. Today the MP for Wellingborough insisted he is 'totally innocent' of allegations of benefit fraud. He also criticised both the county council and the police force over their handling of the case. Downing Street refused to be drawn on the case, pending the outcome of the legal investigations. Mr . Bone was questioned in relation to a dispute with Northamptonshire . County Council about the funding of residential care for his . mother-in-law, Dorothy Sweeney, which is currently the subject of a . civil court case. The Times . reported that questions were asked about concerns that the council was . not given accurate information about Mrs Sweeney's assets before . providing benefits totalling around £100,000. Anyone with assets of more than £23,250 is expected to pay their own care home fees. In . November, a file was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service, which will . decide whether there is enough evidence to lay charges. Last night Mr Bone, who denies any wrongdoing, told the Mail he was facing a ‘personal nightmare at the hands of the police’. He said that today he will complain to the CPS about the way he had been treated. Mr . Bone said: 'Ultimately, the issue at the heart of this dispute is very . simple: either Jennie and I have looked after her mother properly, or we . are devious, thieving, crooks. 'I . know the answer to that question and based on all the evidence, which . they have, they should know too that we are totally innocent.' Mrs . Sweeney has lived in a private care home for seven years but for part . of that time, some of the fees were paid by Northamptonshire County . Council. The local authority is supposed to pay care fees only if the person has assets of less than £23,250. The . police acted over concerns that Mrs Sweeney had just sold a house and . therefore should have been paying the full amount for her care because . she had assets. There is no . suggestion that she acted improperly. Northamptonshire Police said a . 61-year-old man had been interviewed under caution in April ‘in . connection with alleged fraud offences’. Peter Bone and his wife Jennie pictured at home. He has denied any wrongdoing . Mr . Bone said he accepted there was ‘a dispute regarding part of the care . home fees’, and that his family have paid ‘substantial funds’ towards . the fees. ‘It is absolutely untrue that any of Mrs Sweeney’s assets were hidden,’ he said. ‘They . were all declared on the appropriate forms to the county council and . this has never been challenged. There is no shortfall to the county . council for £100,000.' Mr . Bone added: ‘Since March last year, my wife and I have been living . through a surreal nightmare – two people who have always supported and . respected the police, who have had their belief shattered.’ The MP denied the council’s claims and said a civil case with it was ongoing. He has written to the Chief Constable of Northamptonshire Police about the handling of the case. Mr Bone is one of the Commons’ most colourful characters, often referring to ‘Mrs Bone’ when posing questions to ministers. He . so regularly phrases questions to David Cameron as being on her behalf . that the Prime Minister once told the Commons that ‘a very big part of . my life is trying to give pleasure to Mrs Bone’. Asked . about the allegations today, the Prime Minister's official spokesman . said: ‘I think there's a process going forward here with the appropriate . authorities and that's what should be followed.’ Mr . Bone said the ‘most hurtful’ aspect of the affair was the suggestion . that the couple may have ‘stolen’ his mother-in-law's money. He . pointed to a sworn affidavit in which she made clear she had signed . over power of attorney so that her money could be used by her daughter . ‘to pay off personal debts incurred while she was ill and towards my . grandson's school fees, as well as care home fees and personal . expenses’. A . Northamptonshire Police spokeswoman said: ‘A 61-year-old man was . formally interviewed under caution in April 2013 in connection with . alleged fraud offences. ‘A police file was submitted to the CPS in November 2013 and we await their decision.’ A . spokesman for Northamptonshire County Council said: ‘We have read the . comments made by Peter Bone and contest many points he has made. ‘Because of ongoing legal considerations we cannot comment on this matter any further.’ The . Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement: ‘In November 2013, the . CPS received a file from Northamptonshire Police concerning a . 61-year-old man formally interviewed under caution in April 2013 in . connection with alleged fraud offences. ‘We will reach a decision in this case as soon as is practicable.’ It is estimated that around 20,000 pensioners a year sell their homes to pay for their own care. Under NHS rules, the majority of pensioners with assets worth more than £23,250 must fund their own care - including practically everyone who owns property. Councils carry out assessments on people who are taken into care, and those who exceed the cap must contribute to costs. Between £14,250 and £23,250 the cost is shared with councils, but above the threshold it is entirely up to those in care. Below £14,250, councils will still draw on a resident's income but will not touch their assets. Councils are required to leave those in care with just £23.50 of their own each week to spend. There are exceptions to the rules if a stay turns out to be temporary, and for those who have mental illnesses. Recently councils have become more willing to investigate the financial affairs of the elderly in order to claw back costs of care. ‘Avoidance inspectors’ trawl through records to try and identify what they call ‘deliberate deprivation’ of assets. Age UK has called for the cap to be raised to £100,000 so that pensioners can protect their homes and pass on more savings to their children. The charity’s director general Michelle Mitchell has previously said: ‘The £23,250 cap is so sharp and is unfair on many people who have worked hard all their lives, because all their assets – including their home – are taken into account. They can see their savings swept away.’","Eurosceptic MP Peter Bone's house was raided by police last year .

Mourning: Crowds in Kiev's Independence Square yesterday honour the 82 who were killed in anti-government protests . British involvement in a £19billion bailout of Ukraine would be ‘completely unacceptable’, MPs warned last night. Foreign Secretary William Hague told MPs that Ukraine’s fledgling revolution could collapse within weeks unless it receives billions in aid from the international community. But Conservative and Labour MPs joined forces in the Commons to warn ministers that Britain should resist pouring huge sums into the troubled former Soviet state until it has tackled its endemic corruption problems. It came after Ukraine appealed for urgent help to prevent its economy ‘heading into the abyss’. Acting Ukrainian president Oleksandr Turchinov warned that Kiev could default on its debts unless it receives £19billion over the next two years. But Mr Hague, who will hold crisis talks on the situation in Washington today, played down a suggestion from Chancellor George Osborne that  Britain would offer Ukraine’s revolutionaries a blank cheque. Tory MP Bill Cash warned against getting sucked into a European Union backed bailout,  saying the potential cost to British taxpayers was ‘so horrendous as to be completely unacceptable’. Former Labour foreign secretary Jack Straw said ‘rapacious and endemic corruption’ in Ukraine was now so widespread that aid should be withheld unless ‘very stringent’ conditions are met to ensure it is not misspent. And Labour veteran Dennis Skinner said it was extraordinary that ministers were suggesting ‘taking money from the pockets of flood-ravaged and  austerity-ridden Britain to hand over to the EU fanatics in  the Ukraine’. Poland also warned that any aid package for Ukraine would have to be very tightly monitored. Bailout: Foreign Secretary William Hague gives a statement about the situation in Ukraine in the House of Commons today . The country’s foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski, one of the EU’s mediators in the crisis, said: ‘As you know in Ukraine we have a long record of agreements that have not been honoured.’ Mr Hague, who held talks with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday, said initial aid was likely to come from the International Monetary Fund and would not involve a financial contribution from Britain. He said: ‘What we are talking about is IMF support that does not involve any extra money being taken out of the pockets of anyone in the UK.’ Mr Hague said Ukraine was in dire need of aid after Russia indicated it would pull the plug on a £12billion bailout following the dramatic overthrow of former president Viktor Yanukovych at the weekend.  Mr Hague suggested some aid would be needed to prop up Ukraine before it holds elections in May. Tribute: People lay flowers and mourn the victims of the violent clashes with police last week . ‘Ukraine’s financial situation is very serious and without outside assistance may not be sustainable,’ he said. ‘An economic crisis in Ukraine would be a grave threat to the country’s stability and have damaging wider consequences.’ Mr Osborne suggested Britain would offer Ukraine a blank cheque at the weekend, saying: ‘We are here, ready to help, just as soon as  there is someone at the end of  the telephone. ‘We should be there with a chequebook to help the people of Ukraine rebuild their country.’ But Mr Hague yesterday insisted the international community would be cautious before handing over any money. He said demands would include an end to ‘pervasive corruption’, along with widespread economic reforms. Diplomacy: European Union foreign policy chief Baroness Ashton met with Ukrainian UDAR party leader and former boxing champion Vitaly Klitschko today . He added: ‘It requires a stable and legitimate government to be in place and a commitment to the reforms necessary to produce economic stability. ‘International financial support cannot be provided without conditions and clarity that it will be put to proper use.’ The IMF agreed a £10billion loan for Ukraine in 2010, but suspended the deal last year after Kiev failed to implement the required reforms, which included removing gas price subsidies and freely floating the currency. The EU is also looking at a potential bailout, although this is likely to be forthcoming only if Ukraine first reaches a deal with the IMF. ‘Nothing can be ruled out,’ an EU official said. ‘Many of the proposals we’re working on require an IMF deal to be in place, which means an operational government in Ukraine, so it can’t happen until after the elections. ‘But the EU is in a good position to coordinate action if member states want to provide money.

Traitor: But MI6 bosses believed that Kim Philby could not possibly have betrayed his country . British spy bosses repeatedly tried to protect Soviet double agent Kim Philby because they believed he 'couldn't possibly be a traitor', according to a new book which was banned by MI6. Tim Milne, an MI6 spy who was Philby's oldest friend, has revealed the extraordinary lengths to which intelligence officials went in order to protect the notorious figure. Philby came under suspicion when two other members of the Cambridge spy ring fled to Moscow - but despite a 12-year investigation, he was never brought to justice and was eventually allowed to defect to the USSR himself. MI6 chiefs refused to believe that he could be guilty because of his apparently distinguished service and Establishment background, and shielded him from an MI5 probe. Milne was a childhood friend of Philby's after the pair attended Westminster School together, and they travelled across Europe as students in the early 1930s. When Philby joined MI6, he recruited Milne to be his deputy, giving the author a unique insight into the investigation which eventually unveiled his old friend as a foreign agent. In 1951, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean - old friends with Philby from their Cambridge days - fled to Moscow after being unmasked as Soviet spies. It was obvious that someone had tipped the two men off to allow them to escape, and Philby was eventually forced to resign his position as the senior British spy liaising with U.S. officials. Defector: Philby pictured in Moscow after defecting to the Soviet Union in 1963 . Couple: The double agent married his fourth wife, Rufina Pukhova, after settling in Russia . However, Milne's book - titled Kim Philby: The Unknown Story of the KGB's Master-Spy - reveals that MI6 bosses did not believe that he was actually guilty of Soviet spying, according to the Guardian. 'There were very few people in the service who had inspired so much trust and respect as Kim, and so much affection among those who had worked closely with him,' the author writes. 'The general office belief was that he'd had to go simply to preserve good relations with the Americans.' Sir Stewart Menzies, head of MI6 during the war, even told the director of MI5 that Philby - who had previously been in charge of detecting double agents - 'couldn't possibly be a traitor'. Escape: Donald Maclean, left, and Guy Burgess, right, defected to Moscow in 1951, casting suspicion on Philby . Establishment: Anthony Blunt, left, was one of Britain's top art historians; the 'fifth man' is thought to have been John Cairncross, right . Revelations: The inside story of the hunt for Philby is told in a new book by Tim Milne . Despite losing his post at MI6, . Philby was employed as a journalist in Beirut with the help of security . officials, and maintained links with the serivce. The . next year, bosses decided to send an agent to Beirut to interrogate . him, but MI6 insisted on sending one of Philby's ex-colleagues, Nicholas . Elliott, rather than a famously tough MI5 agent. Milne . reveals in his book that Elliott - who believed Philby when he said he . had stopped spying for the KGB 16 years earlier - made several blunders . in the questioning which allowed the double agent to walk free yet . again. Elliott's recording of the interrogation was inaudible because of the noise of traffic outside, and he allowed Philby not to sign a statement in which he admitted his guilt, instead saying he would return for another meeting later. Before that meeting took place, Philby vanished in January 1963 and settled in Moscow, where he lived for 25 years before his death. MI6 officials continued to insist that he had given them valuable information about other agents, according to Milne, even telling Harold Macmillan that he had helped detect Soviet spies in Britain. The security services tried to block the appearance of Milne's book, but after he died in 2010 his family continued the fight against censorship, and this week it will be published by Biteback Publishing. The 'Cambridge Five' spying scandal rocked the Establishment by revealing Soviet double agents at the heart of many of Britain's most storied institutions. Kim Philby, Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean and Anthony Blunt all met at the University of Cambridge, where Blunt was an academic and the other three were undergraduates. The older man recruited the students to the Soviet cause before the Second World War - and they remained devoted to the USSR even after the start of the Cold War. Philby was head of counter-intelligence for MI6, while Maclean was a Foreign Office official and Burgess worked for the BBC. Drama: A scene from 2003 BBC series Cambridge Spies, starring Toby Stephens, left, as Kim Philby and Tom Hollander, right, as Guy Burgess . Blunt was the most eminent of all, as director of the Courtauld Institute and keeper of the royal family's art collection. In 1951, Burgess and Maclean were exposed as double agents - but after being tipped off by Philby they were able to escape to Moscow. Despite the suspicion surrounding Philby, he avoided detection until 1963, when he too defected to the USSR. Blunt escaped exposure for even longer - it was not until 1979, when Margaret Thatcher named him as a suspect in the House of Commons, that he confessed to his treachery and was stripped of his titles. The 'fifth man' in the spy ring has never been definitively identified, but was named as John Cairncross by KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky. The story of the unlikely traitors has been dramatised several times, including in John le Carré's classic book Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and a 2003 BBC series titled Cambridge Spies.","MI6 bosses thought Philby 'couldn't possibly be a traitor', book reveals .

It was the very company which threatened the existence of electricals retail giant Dixons, but now the 77-year-old company is in talks for a potential £3.5billion merger with the Carphone Warehouse. Many thought the death knell was about to sound for the British electrical goods retailer when, in 2008, US retailer Best Buy announced plans to open a chain of stores in Europe, in which it would be able to use the local knowledge of its mobile phone operator partner. But after a remarkable turnaround, the British retailer, which has been a staple of the high street since it was founded in 1937, is now itself looking to merge with the Carphone Warehouse after seeing off the challenge of the American firm. Dixons has been a staple of the British high street since it was formed in 1937. It is now in talks with the Carphone Warehouse over a potential £3.5billion merger . Dixons was turned into a multi-billion pound retail operation under the leadership of Lord Stanley Kalms (pictured), who stepped down in 2002 . Dixons Retail Group, Europe's No. 2 electricals retailer, said the discussions are at an early stage and that no decisions have been made about how a tie-up might be structured. Both companies are valued at around £1.75billion on the London stock market. Carphone was founded in 1989 by Charles Dunstone, who still owns 23 per cent of the company. It has more than 2,000 stores across Europe. Former Dixons chief executive John Browett, who joined the company at the end of 2007 and left in 2012 to join Apple, has been credited with overhauling the business, while current boss Sebastian James is said to have continued the transformation. In the seven months after the Carphone Warehouse announced it was joining forces with Best Buy in May 2008, the share prices for Dixons fell from 51.75p to just 6.75p. At the same as the announcement the retailer's other stores, Currys and PC World, appeared to be losing out to competition from the internet and supermarkets and the unfolding economic crisis battered the high street. However, the store has now seen a change in fortunes - it only trails Media-Saturn, owned by German retailer Metro, by annual sales in Europe, and has seen its shares increase by 74 per cent over the last year. The moment of its turnaround arguably arrived just as credit insurer Atradius reduced its cover guaranteeing payments to the retailer's suppliers, according to The Times. Former chief executive John Browett (left) has been credited with overhauling the business, while current boss Sebastian James (right) has continued the transformation . At the same time, in November 2008, Best Buy was issuing its first ever profits warnings. Mr Browett however had been left encouraged by the new Currys Megastore in Wednesbury, near Birmingham which took £2.3m in its first four days. The American firm eventually opened its first store in Essex in April 2010 but the business, unfamiliar with British buyers, never really took off and by 2012 it closed its ten 'big box' megastores it had opened in the joint venture with Carphone Warehouse. Dixons however was going from strength to strength, aided by an exclusive deal to distribute the iPad. The company has since recently reported its second year in a row of improved Christmas trading as it benefited from the demise of rival Comet. Dixons has more than 500 stores across the UK and Ireland, predominantly in out-of-town retail parks and increasingly as '2-in-1' Currys PC World stores (file picture) New chief executive Mr James recently off-loaded its loss-making e-commerce business PIXmania, operations in Turkey, and partially exited Italy. He has meanwhile, made no secret of his desire to increase the firm's exposure to mobile phones, making the Carphone Warehouse a seemingly obvious partner. The two companies said in a statement yesterday: ‘The boards of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse note the recent speculation and confirm that the two companies are in preliminary discussions regarding a possible merger of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse. Carphone Warehouse was founded in 1989 by Charles Dunstone, who still owns 23 per cent of the company . ‘These discussions are at a very preliminary stage and there can be no certainty that a transaction will be forthcoming. No decision has been reached regarding the structuring of any such merger.’ Dixons has more than 500 stores across the UK and Ireland, predominantly in out-of-town retail parks and increasingly as '2-in-1' Currys PC World stores. The company has an ongoing relationship with Phones4U, which sees Carphone's rival offer PC World and Currys customers the latest mobile technology in a number of stores. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analysts said: ‘In a world of “connected devices”, Dixons is under-exposed to the key area of mobile/smartphone retailing and it is known that they were looking at getting more involved in the area. ‘Dixons’ ebullient CEO Seb James hasn’t seemed entirely satisfied with the arrangement with Phones4U, and if you want to be involved in this market you ought to be in bed with the best-in-class operator, which is undoubtedly Carphone.' The move comes after Dixons announced it was selling its poorly performing mobile phone stores The Link to O2 for £30m in June 2006. At the time, DSG interntional admitted it could no longer compete with the likes of Carphone Warehouse or the mobile phone operators' own chains as it said it was near to completing the sale of its 60 per cent stake in The Link to O2, the owner of the other 40 per cent.","Dixons and Carphone Warehouse are in talks for £3.5billion merger .

One regular visitor was writer Doyle who was one of the most famous spiritualists of his day, finding solace in the practice after losing his wife Louise in 1906 and his son Kingsley just before the end of the First World War. Records show that Ipswich Psychic Society - as the church was once known - hosted popular garden parties and talks that attracted as many as 1,000 people. Kandi Munson, The Cedars' president, said the imposing Victorian property was originally bought for £800.

'We've got all his books on spiritualism - all first editions which he gave us. They are locked away but they won't be sold as part of the house.

Auctioneer Tim Golding said: 'It's a special property and not just because of its history.' The Cedars will be going under the hammer at Goldings Auctions at Wherstead Park next month. Beliefs: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle . Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle found solace in spirituality and the belief in being able to contact the dead after sinking into depression following the deaths of his wife Louisa and son Kingsley, as well as his brother and other relatives. Kingsley Doyle had died in October 1918, just before the end of the First World War, after contracting pneumonia while recovering from an injury inflicted during the Battle of the Somme. The year after his youngest son's death Doyle attended a sitting with a Welsh medium in which he claimed Kingsley had spoke to him, and that he had also seen his mother and nephew. He became a leading voice in the spiritualist movement, even writing a Professor Challenger novel The Land Of Mist on the subject, while his 1922 book The Coming Of The Fairies revealed he was apparently convinced that the Cottingley Fairies photographs were real. Doyle's staunch belief in spiritualism even brought about the end of his friendship with magician Harry Houdini, who began to speak out against spiritualism after the death of his mother. Houdini insisted that mediums used trickery and illusions to fool grieving relatives, but was unable to convince Doyle this was the case. Just after the author's death in July 1930 at the age of 71, a spiritualist meeting was organised at the Royal Albert Hall to enable Conan Doyle to make one final appearance. Thousands of people attended including his second wife Jean and some of his children, and even though the author did not appear, some in the audience claimed they had felt his presence.","The Cedars Spiritualist Church in Ipswich, Suffolk is up for sale at auction .

A new ‘wonder’ drug which increases survival from the most dangerous form of skin cancer must be withheld until patients have undergone chemotherapy, says the NHS rationing watchdog. Ipilimumab increases lifespan by an average of four months in patients with malignant melanoma where the cancer has spread to other organs. But trial data shows more than one in five patients lives for at least three years after treatment. It is estimated the drug can help between 1,000 and 2,000 patients in the UK each year, many of them in their 20s and 30s. Ipilimumab, also known as Yervoy, is used to treat advanced melanoma. But NHS patients can only get access to it once they have undergone chemotherapy . The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) admits the drug is ‘life-extending’ and has already approved its use after chemotherapy. But a new licence means the drug could be used earlier, before patients have to suffer debilitating side effects from chemo such as hair loss. However, Nice says ipilimumab should not be available for patients at this first line stage, only if they take part in clinical trials. The decision has alarmed doctors and campaigners, particularly as the Cancer Drugs Fund says the change would be cost neutral - adding nothing to the NHS bill. More than 10,400 people are diagnosed with malignant melanoma each year and 2,000 people die. It is the most common kind of cancer for women in their 20s . Patients in the U.S. have been able to use the drug immediately they are diagnosed with advanced disease for the last three years because the authorities recognised the benefit. Gill Nuttall, of the charity Melanoma UK, said: 'Advanced melanoma is a devastating diagnosis, yet treatment options remain severely limited for many patients facing this disease. ‘Unless reversed, this decision by Nice will sadly continue this trend and will leave some patients without a medicine that could potentially help extend their lives.’ Around 12,800 Britons are diagnosed each year with melanoma, of which 2,200 die. Manufacturer Bristol-Myers Squibb says the therapy - which stimulates the patient’s own immune system to fight cancer - has the potential to offer long-term survival to some. Treatment costs around £63,000, less an undisclosed discount to the NHS. Guidance issued by Nice in December 2012, gave the go-ahead for use of the drug, also known as Yervoy, on the NHS for advanced malignant melanoma patients who have already undergone chemotherapy. At the time, Nice called the drug a ‘breakthrough treatment’ saying that it could ‘potentially significantly improve the prognosis for some people with malignant melanoma'. Last year, European health officials extended the licence of the drug so it could also be used in previously untreated patients - not just those who had undergone chemotherapy. But Nice says the manufacturer has not provided enough evidence to show the drug as a first-line treatment can extend the lives of patients.

Meanwhile, his brother Michael, 40, conned another man, Kenneth Cook, into believing his roof was on the verge of collapsing. Mr Cook, who is believed to be in his 50s, forked out £22,350 for the building work on his house in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands. Both of the victims lived alone and were cold-called by the younger brother, Birmingham Crown Court heard. The brothers were caught out after Mr Halford's concerned bank manager contacted Birmingham Trading Standards.

His older brother was imprisoned for two years and seven months . Sam Smith has now been jailed for five years and four months after pleading guilty to seven counts of fraud, while his brother, Michael, has been sentenced to two years and seven months in prison. Mark Jackson, prosecuting, said Mr Halford, a bachelor who had lived alone for 40 years, had passed away before his tormenters were brought to justice. He added that Sam Smith's work on the pensioner's home was 'completely pointless, completely worthless - it’s just a con.' 'For two years he milked Mr Halford for every penny he had in the world,' he said. 'Mr Halford spent his life’s savings effectively paying Sam Smith. He had had to borrow in the end when all his own money ran out.' Mr Jackson said that if the work had been necessary, Smith’s fee should have been worth little more than £20,000. Sentencing the pair, Recorder Edward Coke said: 'I can’t describe this as anything other than despicable.' He told Sam Smith it must have been obvious Mr Halford was in his 80s - adding: 'I’ve come to the conclusion this was planned, systematic befriending of an elderly gentleman, who you knew lived on his own. 'Mr Halford welcomed the attention, welcomed the company and welcomed the persistent kindness he thought he was getting.

Amid waves of 30 feet and winds of 60 knots, the Svendborg began losing containers off northern France . It only discovered the extent of its loss after it arrived in the Spanish port of Malaga this week . The company said of the 520 that have gone unaccounted for, 85 per cent of them were empty and the others held dry goods like frozen meat. It stressed that none of the missing storage boxes contained dangerous goods. Many of the containers that survived the storm collapsed and were left crushed. Palle Laursen, vice president of operations for Maersk Line, said: 'The total number of lost containers turned out to be even worse than we feared. 'Svendborg Maersk experienced unexpected, extreme weather conditions – and we will now carefully examine our procedures to see if they need correction in order to avoid similar incidents in the future,' Sea Trade Global reported. After the ship arrived in Malaga, Maersk discovered that about 520 containers were unaccounted for . The company said of the 520 that have gone unaccounted for, 85 per cent of them were empty . On Friday the French environmental group Robin des Bois said it would sue Maersk for failing to disclose the full extent of the loss when it occurred, putting the lives of others in danger, causing pollution and abandoning waste at sea. The group claims the containers were a lasting danger to fishing vessels and the environment. The revelations about the overboard containers came after a shipping container stuffed with a million cigarettes washed up on the Devon coast. The 40-foot box - which contains 14 tonnes of cigarettes - which landed at Seaton, Devon, could be the first of many to wash up on the Lyme Bay coast in the coming days. It said that 15 per cent of the containers lost held dry goods like frozen meat . An environmental group claims the containers were a lasting danger to fishing vessels and the environment . The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) is arranging recovery of the Maersk container which landed over the weekend. Police officers who have cordoned off the beach issued a stern warning to anyone hoping to pick up any free loot. A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'It was reported by a member of the public... and officers are on scene to make sure no one puts themselves at risk to recover anything. A container, lost from a vessel in the Bay of Biscay, carrying thousands of cigarettes has washed up on the pebble beach of Seaton in Devon . The battered container which spilled its contents over a wide area has now been cordoned off by police . 'The contents belong initially to the . original owner of the container, and then to the official Receiver of . Wrecks, so anyone taking anything that washes ashore, even one packet of . cigarettes, is effectively committing theft and will be prosecuted. 'So the message to anyone intending to go down there looking for free fags is don't bother.'

The 40ft long Maersk crate was spotted floating in the sea seven miles south of Portland Bill, Dorset.

Nearly 70-years ago, they were laid in the sand to stop the Nazis invading from the west. Now the tank traps built to protect Britain from Hitler's Panzer division have been uncovered on a beach after sand was washed away by the storms. The metal structures, built using a mixture of heavy chains and disused railway track, were exposed on a beach in Porthcawl, South Wales. Discovered: The tank traps were uncovered on rest Bay in Porthcrawl, South Wales in the aftermath of the storms that have swept the country . The traps, several feet high, were set in 1940 when the country feared that Britain might be invaded after Dunkirk. They were part of a long coastal line of barricades to prevent enemy tanks from moving inland if they successfully reached the shores. Porthcawl historian Keith Morgan, who remembers the tank defences from when he was a child, said they were still visible until 1946 or 1947. He said: 'They were chains and old railway lines which were embedded upright in the beach. They would have been around six or seven feet above the level of the beach. 'I can remember them stretching from Swansea Bay all the way round to Porthcawl. Tough: The historic fortifications are made of chains and old railway lines . Barricades: They formed part of an enormous line of coastal defences to prevent tanks from advancing inland . 'They were then cut down at some point after the war but even then, I remember going swimming in Swansea Bay and catching my toe on them - it could be pretty painful.' A number of tank defences were built in Wales, nine of which formed the backbone of the Western Command defence. It was developed in 1940 and 11 of the barricades used rivers as their backbones. Many were used to protect approaches by enemies into the North West from places such as the Arctic Circle and the Bay of Biscay. However the main threat stemmed from the . Republic of Ireland. Britain feared the country, which was neutral at . the time, could provide a launching point for the German forces. Those in South Wales were also used to guard against the flourishing mining communities which included the coal fields and industrial belt. Concrete obstacles, which can still be seen today, were the main defensive lines set up on beaches. Anti-aircraft poles and wire obstacles were also used. Around 30 beaches were said to have had the defences installed. Council workmen will start digging them up and removing them this week after local beach walkers at Rest Bay complained they were a dangerous hazard. Local Simon Tucker took photos of the remains of about a dozen traps and posted them on Facebook to warn surfers and other beach users. He said yesterday: 'The council cut them back quite a few years ago but they are exposed now more than ever. 'They have been visible since the first storm back in January - it surprises me nothing's been done about it because they are so dangerous.' A Bridgend council spokesperson said highways workers would be taking a digger to the beach to remove the traps. Crews . and machinery had been deployed elsewhere to tackle storm damage and . the council had also been waiting for the sand on the beach to settle. 'About . nine' World War Two explosives have been washed up on a beach in Essex . following recent storms, Thames Coastguard have said. They have been on the beach for nearly 70 years, but cause a problem for swimmers who can catch themselves on it . Line: The defences extended along the Welsh coast, all the way along to Merionenth Gwynedd in North Wales . Base: The defences were built eight miles away from RAF Stormy Down (picture during WWII) which was an armament training centre for the RAF . Engulfed: Enormous waves caused by the high winds hit Porthcrawl Lighthouse while storms battered British coast lines . Controlled explosions: 'About nine' World War Two explosives were washed up on a beach in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex . Remains: Last week, 100 miles up the Welsh coast in Borth, an ancient forest thought to be 6,000 years old was uncovered by the storms . Experts from the Royal Navy carried out controlled explosions on the anti-aircraft shells at Westcliff-on-Sea at about 09:45 GMT. They were called in by coastguards, after a man walking on the beach on Sunday morning spotted the explosives. They were identified as anti-aircraft shells by the navy experts. Thames Coastguard said the shells, which were corroded but still live, were found at low water at Ray Gut channel, about half a mile away from Westcliff seafront.

This is the selfie kidnapper Chris Edwards produced to scare his victim into handing over money. Grinning inanely with an AK47 assault rifle, it is one of a catalogue of chilling images by the gangster. The 34-year-old kept the menacing image on his mobile phone to threaten those who dared to cross him. Other photos he posted on Facebook showed him lounging around in a leopard print so-called 'pimp suit', posing with a bull terrier dog and shouting at police during the 2012 riots. Menacing: Chris Edwards, 34, would produce this image to threaten people that crossed him . In September, the Manchester-based gangster was arrested after holding a man captive for three hours and threatening him with a machete. During his ordeal, the victim was shown the picture of Edwards in a bid to make him hand over drugs money. The unnamed victim, 31, was later freed unharmed and went to the police. Today Edwards from Salford, Greater Manchester was jailed for ten years after he was found guilty of false imprisonment and possession of drugs with intent to supply. Jacob Minister, 25, of Salford was jailed for 15 years after he was found guilty following a trial of false imprisonment, possession with intent to supply and using an imitation firearm with the intention of causing harm or distress. Threatening: He uploaded images of ammunition to Facebook as he flaunted his gangster lifestyle in Salford . The 34-year-old was today jailed for 10 years for possession of drugs and false imprisonment . He said he had been storing cocaine for Minister and had decided to stop. But after he was allowed home, the man was summoned to a meeting by Edwards and Minister. Moments later a black Corsa pulled up with both Edwards and Minister inside, the victim got in and was told he wasn’t going anywhere until he had 'paid the money he owed.' Minister took the victim’s phone and accused him of being bugged and said if he tried to escape he would be stabbed. The gangster (right) is here pictured taunting police during the 2012 riots in a Facebook photo . Jailed: Police arrested Edwards after the victim he held with Jacob Minister, 25, reported the crime . They then went to Edwards’ house where the victim was terrorised before being driven home. He managed to contact his partner to say he was being held against his will and Edwards and Minister were arrested in a police swoop. Detective Constable Sean Fitzgerald said after the case: 'These two men preyed on a vulnerable man, they provided him with drugs on tick and when he could not pay they started to use him to store their supply. 'The threats escalated and when they found out he told the police he was storing drugs on their behalf, he was kidnaped and held at knife point. His capture is one of a number in Salford recently as police crack down on organised crime in the area . 'If he had not been able to contact his partner who knows what these men could have been capable of.' Chief Superintendant Mary Doyle, divisional commander for Salford, said: 'Over the past few years, we have had some tremendous successes in Salford in tackling organised criminal gangs. 'We have seized millions of pounds worth of drugs, firearms and cash and as residents will have already seen, we have secured some lengthy convictions for some of these organised crime group members. 'By taking so many of these gang members off the streets and seizing huge quantities of drugs and other items associated with criminality, we have made massive inroads into disrupting these criminal networks and as a result, Salford is a safer place to live and work.'","Chris Edwards, 34, produced the image on his phone to threaten victim .

Qianhao, ZTE’s head of handsets strategy told MailOnline, this trend . for an improved front-facing camera in particular is being driven in . China by people who want to be able to take better selfies. This focus from leading smartphone firms on camera quality is a direct challenge to Nokia’s range of Lumia phones, a number of which use advanced photo features as the unique selling point. For example, the Nokia Lumia 1520 phablet features a 20MP camera, while the Lumia 1020 still leads the market with a 41MP shooter. However, with the launch of Nokia X earlier this morning, the Finnish firm is already looking at alternative markets and customers. HTC was rumoured to launch a flagship, second-generation version of its HTC One, called M8 with a 5-inch screen. However, this is now likely to be released at a special HTC event scheduled for March 25. HTC also used today’s event to launch its Power To Give Initiative. It lets smartphone owners share their phone’s processors to power research, communities and more through a dedicated app. Despite the HTC's impressive number of meagpixels, Nokia's Lumia (pictured) still leads the market in phone photography with its 41MP camera . Build-wise the Desire 816 feels much more expensive than other mid-range phones. It has a mixture of soft and smooth textures on the sides and back, and although this may sound odd, it gives the handset quite a unique quality - and adds to the feeling of holding a premium device. The screen does looks unmanageable at first glance and stretching from one corner to another to open a menu feels alien. The display itself is sharp, noticeably so. Even more noticeable on a device priced so low and the extra size, coupled with this sharpness does HTC's BlinkFeed a lot of justice.

Guilty: Alba Gonzalez Camacho was given a one-year suspended sentence for inciting violence on Twitter . A Spanish woman has become the first person in the country's history to be convicted for inciting terrorism through Twitter. Alba Gonzalez Camacho, 21, was given a one-year suspended sentence for using the social network to call for a defunct left wing terrorist group to reform and kill senior politicians. The student, from Jaen in Andalusia, had offered to tattoo herself with the face of anyone who shoots Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and senior minister Luis De Guindos, while also calling for the reformation of GRAPO - communist terrorists who killed more than 80 people in the 1970s and 80s. Gonzalez Camacho's terrorism conviction is the first of its kind involving Twitter posts in Spain, with the judge at the National Court in Madrid agreeing with the prosecution's argument that she had posted 'messages with an ideological content that was highly radicalized and violent'. Although she was sentenced to a year in prison, she was given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to posting the tweets, meaning she will not go to prison unless she commits another crime. Gonzalez Camacho has also been disqualified from holding public office for the next seven years. Although she never previously been in trouble with the law, the student social worker describes herself on Twitter as a 'subversive... with a heart darker than night but a soul red like blood.' Still active on the social network using the handle @albacorazonegro, her page features images of Che Guevara and a Soviet flag. One tweet under scrutiny from July 2012 read, 'The PP [governing Popular Party] taught me that there is still a great need for the GRAPO.' Other tweets called for violence against members of the PP, with one reading: 'I promise to tattoo myself with the face of the person who shoots Rajoy in the neck and also shoots one in De Guindos. #RajoyCoward #rescue'. Gonzalez Camacho has reportedly refused to be interviewed over the trial, saying the case has already brought her family enough trouble, but the New York Times claims to have had an email exchange with her in which she described herself as a 'normal girl'. Targets: The student, from Jaen in Andalusia, had offered to tattoo herself with the face of anyone who shoots Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy (right) and senior minister Luis De Guindos (left) The newspaper claims she added that the intention of her Twitter posts was to fight 'a system in which a minority lives on the back of the death, misery and exploitation of a majority' in a country where the euro crisis has caused widespread economic despair. 'The truth is that I’m a very normal girl, who has never landed herself in any kind of problem... But if I tell you everything that I’m fed up with, I would never stop,' she added. 'I never imagined something like that could happen to me because you find a lot of nonsense on the Internet, including worse than mine... But it seems that here that the prosecution is only for those from one side - the Fascists can say whatever they want, and nothing will ever happen to them,' she said. The conviction comes after conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy began exploring the possibility of increasing restrictions on public protests in Spain. Alba Gonzalez Camacho sent this tweet, which translates as: 'I promise to tattoo myself with the face of the person who shoots Rajoy in the neck and also shoots one in De Guindos. #RajoyCoward #rescue' In November he agreed a controversial bill to make it a criminal offence to use the internet to organise a protest that turns violent, which has since led to criticism that the legislation has been used to unfairly target left-wing groups, despite a growing number of far-right protests in the country. The history of terrorism in Spain is dominated by far-left and separatist organisations, which emerged under the brutal Fascist Franco dictatorship that ended in 1975. The country's worst ever attack came in 2004, however, when a group of Islamists killed 191 people in a bombing at the Atocha train station in Madrid. GRAPO, often referred to in English as the First of October Anti-Fascist Resistance Group, emerged in 1976, with its violent acts leading to the deaths of more than 80 people in the first decade of its existence. Its last known victim was a businesswoman killed in a botched kidnapping in 2006. Although the group has never formally disbanded, the death of its historical leader in 2001 and the conviction 24 members in 2007 are believed to have led to an effective break up.","Alba Gonzalez Camacho, 21, incited violence against two senior politicians .

The whereabouts of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych is still unclear a day after he left the . capital . The whereabouts of ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych is still unclear a day after he fled the capital Kiev. A plane with Mr Yanukovych on board was denied permission to take off on Saturday evening from Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine which was en route to Russia, the State Border Guard Service said. The president's spokesman said on Sunday morning that even he does not know where Mr Yanukovych is. New acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said the State Border Service had detained some of Yanukovych's armed guards in the incident when he sought to fly to Russia from Donetsk. The service had 'prevented the departure of an unidentified aircraft', he said. 'The president's bodyguards were inside. They had failed to pass the required security clearance and were detained. 'President Yanukovych emerged from the aircraft, got in a car and left in an unknown direction.' Two senior Yanukovych officials also evaded arrest after a shootout in a VIP lounge at an airport, he said. An probe is now underway into how former tax minister Oleksandr Klymenko and ex-prosecutor general, Viktor Pshonka fled. Avakov said: 'Klymenko and Pshonka were prevented from boarding a flight at an airport yesterday. 'Armed men broke into the VIP lounge, fire was exchanged, after which Klymenko and Pshonka drove off. An inquiry is under way.' Meanwhile, former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko was freed from prison and returned to Kiev to address a massive crowd. Scroll down for videos . People walk around Ukrainian President Yanukovych's countryside-residence in Mezhyhirya . The Kiev protest camp at the centre of the anti-Yanukovych movement was calm but still full of dedicated demonstrators on Sunday morning after a day that saw a stunning reversal of fortune in a political stand-off that has worried the US, Europe and Russia. Ukraine is deeply divided between eastern regions that are largely pro-Russian and western areas that widely detest Mr Yanukovych and long for closer ties with the European Union (EU). Mr Yanukovych's shelving of an agreement with the EU in November set off the wave of protests but they quickly expanded their grievances to corruption, human rights abuses and calls for his resignation. The political crisis in the nation of 46 million has changed with speed repeatedly in the past week. First there were signs that tensions were easing, followed by horrifying violence and then a deal signed under Western pressure that aimed to resolve the conflict but left the unity of the country in question. A protester poses in a bathtub while a crowd takes photographs inside the Ukrainian president's home . A protestor waves the European Union flag outside the front door of the sprawling mansion. Opposition icon Yulia Tymoshenko told supporters on her release from prison that she believed Ukraine would be joining the EU . Protester self-defence units who have taken control of the capital peacefully changed shifts on Sunday. Helmeted and wearing makeshift shields, they have replaced police guarding the president's administration and parliament and have sought to stop radical forces from inflicting damage or unleashing violence. Thousands of Ukrainians roamed the suddenly open grounds of the lavish compound outside Kiev where Mr Yanukovych was believed to live. The house has been closed off to the world for nearly a decade. Inside they discovered the scale of opulence the 63-year-old built around him. The property in Mezhyhirya, an hours drive from Kiev, has a golf course, helicopter pad and is situated in a country where the average salary is less than £300 a month. Below the house, a garage is filled with classic sports cars worth millions, while in the exotic gardens Australian and African ostriches stretch their legs. Parliament, which he controlled the previous day but is now emboldened against him, voted to remove him and set elections for May 25. But Mr Yanukovych said in a televised address that he now regards the parliament as illegitimate and he will not respect its decisions.

Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko speaks to a crowd at a rally in Kiev hours after she was released from prison . Sitting in a wheelchair because of a back problem aggravated during imprisonment, her voice cracked as she spoke . Ms Tymoshenko, whose diadem of blond peasant braids and stirring rhetoric attracted world attention in the 2004 Orange Revolution, was both sad and excited as she spoke to a crowd of about 50,000 on Kiev's Independence Square, where a sprawling protest tent camp was set up in December. Sitting in a wheelchair because of a back problem aggravated during imprisonment, her voice cracked and her face was careworn. Yulia Tymoshenko addresses anti-government protesters gathered in Independence Square . But she praised the protesters who were killed this week in clashes with police. 'You are heroes, you are the best thing in Ukraine!' she said of the victims. The Health Ministry said the death toll in clashes between protesters and police that included sniper attacks had reached 82 dead over the last week. The protesters put that figure at more than 100. She urged the demonstrators not to yield their encampment in the square, known in Ukrainian as the Maidan. Mr Yanukovych's authority in Kiev appeared to be eroding by the hour and suspicions mounted that he was trying to get out of the country. His support base crumbled further as a leading governor and a mayor from the eastern city of Kharkiv fled to Russia. A plane carrying Mr Yanukovych tried to take off on Saturday evening from the eastern city of Donetsk but did not have the proper documentation so was turned away, Oleh Slobodyan of the State Border Guard service said. The president was driven off in a car from the airport, he said. Mr Slobodyan said there has been no record of Yanukovych leaving Ukraine by land, and it was not clear where the plane was headed. Mr Yanukovych spoke on television on Saturday in Kharkiv and accused his opponents of a putsch. 'Everything that is happening today is, to a greater degree, vandalism and banditry and a coup d'etat,' he said. 'I will do everything to protect my country from breakup, to stop bloodshed.' EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton welcomed the release of Ms Tymoshenko as 'an important step forward in view of addressing concerns regarding selective justice in the country'.","A plane with Mr Yanukovych on board was denied permission to take off on Saturday evening from Donetsk .

Nokia has officially launched its first Android handsets – the much-rumoured Nokia X, the X+ and XL - at an event in Barcelona. The X and X+are both entry-level devices with 4-inch screens, while the XL is larger at 5-inches. The X is available now for 89 euros. The X+ and XL go on sale from April for 99 euros and 109 euros respectively. Scroll down for video . Nokia has announced that it's launching its first Android handsets. The X range (pictured) has been designed to look similar to Nokia's current basic Asha smartphones, which run Windows Phone . The UK and US prices for the phones have not yet been announced. Nokia's CEO also announced the Lumia phones will be reduced as a result. The Nokia X is an entry-level device with a 4-inch screen, 5MP camera and just 4GB of memory. The X looks similar to Nokia’s current basic Asha smartphones and is due to go on sale next month. Elsewhere, the screen has a low 800 x 480 resolution and is powered by the 1.2 GHz dual-core processor with 512MB RAM. Despite . being the first Android handset from the Finnish firm, it has chosen to . run an older version of the Google-owner software – Android 4.1 . Jellybean. The most up-to-date version is Android 4.4 KitKat. Camera wise, the Nokia X comes with a rear-facing 3MP camera and the XL includes a 2MP front-facing device and 5MP on the back. Both the Nokia X and Nokia X+ will be available in bright green, bright red, cyan, yellow, black and white. The Nokia XL will be available in bright green, orange, cyan, yellow, black and white. All three devices are powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon dual core processor and support Dual SIM, letting people switch SIM cards to get better deals. The X range has been designed to look similar to Nokia’s current basic Asha smartphones, which run S40 software. Nokia made the announcement at the annual Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona. Nokia also announced a basic smartphone called the 220, with a 2MP camera, for 29 euros and the Asha 230 for 45 euros.  The X series is a significant release for Nokia, despite the basic specifications. Previous Nokia handsets ran the Windows Phone operating systems, and although the software has slowly been gaining ground on both Android and iOS, it still lags behind. Windows Phone has been criticised for being difficult to use and runs a fraction of the popular apps seen on the other platforms. Android, on the other hand, holds the majority share of the smartphone market in every region globally and has an app store with more than 700,000 apps. It is also synonymous with budget and low-end handsets because its intuitive design appeals to less technical users. Nokia will be hoping to attract this end of the market, as well as appeal to emerging markets with the release of X and X+. It hasn't abandoned Windows Phone completely, though. Although the operating system is Android based, Nokia has added the tiles and personalisation features seen on Windows Phone . Asha 500 (pictured) has a 2MP camera and starts at $69 (£42), the 502 and 503 handsets both have 5MP cameras and costs $89 (£55) and $99 (£61) respectively. Pictured is Nokia chief executive Stephen Elop speaking at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona . Similarly, the Nokia X range doesn't use Google apps or cloud services. It seems Nokia has chosen Android purely for the apps than the interface, and will use Microsoft's cloud services including OneDrive instead. The Nokia X range also complements the firm’s existing range of budget handsets, namely the Asha range. The Asha range starts at £42 ($69) with 2MP and 5MP camera models. The original Asha 501 handset was announced in May last year and began shipping in June. It has a 3-inch screen, 3.2MP camera and comes in red, green, cyan, yellow, white and black. The X and X Plus are both entry-level devices with 4-inch screens, while the XL is larger at 5-inches . The latest Asha devices, announced in October added improved sharing options, for example, photos can be shared with one click to Facebook, Twitter, over Bluetooth and now Whatsapp. Asha 500 has a 2MP camera and starts at $69 (£42), the 502 and 503 handsets both have 5MP cameras and costs £55 ($89) and £61 ($99) respectively. The Nokia X, X+ and XL are a vast departure to what we've seen before from the manufacturer - but the customisable, tiled OS is similar to what we got from Nokia's Lumia range, according to Rob Kerr, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com. 'Nokia's new smartphone family might run on Android, but it doesn’t give users access to the Google Play store,' he said. 'However, it will have all of the big-name apps like Facebook, Skype and Twitter, as well as Nokia's own Here maps and Mix Radio. 'Also, with some clever leverage of Microsoft's services with a month's free Skype calls and the OneDrive cloud storage service, the Nokia X range proves a great entry to the smartphone ecosystem for new users.' He added that the lack of easy app access might hold Nokia back but, with a little bit of effort, Android software can be installed on the higher end models via a microSD card. However, Kerr said that could prove a barrier for those without the know-how, or lacking the inclination. 'The XL sports a large five-inch screen. It's nothing new – screens have been getting bigger for a while – but it shows Nokia is keeping up with the Joneses, and phones like the five-inch Samsung Galaxy S4, matching current competition in terms of popularity,' he said. Leaked images of the new Nokia handses emerged earlier this month, under the name Nokia X. Teaser invitations to this morning’s press conference hinted towards this name, too, before a series of ‘early built’ images were posted on Chinese site Coolxap. Rumours about a Nokia handset running Android began towards the end of last year, and these leaked shots appeared to confirm it; with grids and icons similar to those found on existing Android phones. This is likely to be the last Nokia release before Microsoft officially takes over, following an acquisition in September. Nokia chief executive Stephen Elop holds up the Nokia X handsets at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona . The launch of an Android Nokia phone is the company’s latest foray into new areas of the market. Alongside the Asha handsets, Nokia also launched its first tablet last year – the Lumia 2520 10.1-inch tablet running Windows RT. It also launched its first 6-inch, phablet device, the Nokia 1320, to compete with some of the other larger models on the market including the HTC One Max and the Galaxy Note range.

Devastated: Dennis Dunstan, 70, had prepared three mince pies and shandy for Christmas but thieves stole them . A pensioner says his Christmas is ruined after burglars raided his home, stole his car, and ate his entire batch of homemade mince pies. Dennis Dunstan, 70, woke to find thieves had taken thousands of pounds worth of valuables after forcing their way through his kitchen window. They stole £150 from his wallet, a laptop, a digital camera and made off in his £5,000 Smart car. Before they fled the scene, the gang took the shandy and three mince pies Mr Dunstan had prepared for Christmas Day. Devastated, the retired builder from Nottingham said the attack has left him terrified to be in his own home. He said: 'I woke up at 9am the next day and realised what had happened. 'I am a pensioner . and to think they were in my flat while I was asleep is scary, they . could have done anything to me. 'I checked my wallet, which I left on the table but it was above a cabinet, and it had £150 stolen from it. 'I started checking everything and noticed what they had taken and then when I randomly looked in the fridge, I don't know why I did, but I saw they had raided that too. 'I had three mince pies in there on a plate and they ate them and I had a can of shandy which they drank as well. 'For them to take my belongings, my car and laptop is one thing but it is just a complete cheek to steal my food too. 'It has ruined Christmas for me - I've been left with nothing and I can't even enjoy a mince pie. 'Mince pies are my favourite thing about Christmas Day, it is a tradition of mine and I can't even do that now.' Nottinghamshire Police are now investigating the break-in which happened on December 13. Officers . found Dennis' car had been abandoned nearby but the rest of his . belongings are still missing and no arrests have been made. Upset: Mr Dunstan has urged police to catch the thieves who drove off in his car and ruined his Christmas . Dennis added: 'They need to be caught. 'It isn't nice to not feel safe in your own home and the fact all this happened just before Christmas makes it worse. 'You feel helpless though, if they would have woken me I wouldn't have been able to do anything. 'I told my friends about what happened and they were shocked, I am just glad I wasn't physically hurt, this could have been so much worse than what it was.' A spokesman for Nottingham City Homes, which runs Mr Dunstan's housing development, said: 'We were very sorry to hear about the burglary. 'As a result of the comments about security we will be sending out members of staff to see if anything else can be done to make the scheme more secure.' Anyone with information about the burglary is asked to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.","Gang took thousands of pounds worth of valuables from Dennis Dunstan, 70 .

Spending her 29th birthday surrounded by her seven children is a particularly poignant moment for Carrie McArthur - whose whole family was wiped out by a fire when she was a schoolgirl. Carrie vowed to surround herself with a large loving family after she was the only survivor of the fierce blaze at her home in May 1992 when she was just eight. Her mother Susan was 28 when schoolgirl Carrie lost her two sisters and brother in the inferno at their home in Kidwelly, near Swansea. Carrie McArthur, who lost her family in a fire, now has seven children of her own.

Carrie - who suffered serious burns but escaped with her life - said: 'I lost the four people I was closest to - I was only eight and they were gone for ever. 'I can’t replace them but I have been lucky to have my children and they are everything to me.' Carrie is full-time mum to Thomas, nine, Brendan, eight, Harley, seven, Cody, six, Tianna, five, Lewis, four, and six-month-old baby Lucas. She said: 'I am raising them to appreciate what they have in life they are lucky to have. 'I will say to them: 'Don’t take things for granted because you don’t know what is around the corner.' 'I will teach them to treasure every day and cherish the family around you.' Carrie in 1993 recovering after she was released from the burns unit in Chepstow.

Her mother Susan, 28, sisters Christine, nine, and Adele, and eight and brother Robert, five, all perished. Carrie only survived because a brave paramedic battled through the intense heat and smoke to reach her bedroom - and lift her to safety. But she was left with 90 per cent burns and underwent more than 70 painful skin grafts. When she was well enough Carrie returned to school but had to face daily taunts from cruel playground bullies. Carrie said: 'They teased me about my scars, they used to say they could cook an egg on my face. 'But I remember looking in the mirror - I thought I looked like an alien. It was difficult, but I was glad that I was alive. 'Sometimes people would call me Scarface. I used to get called a lot of different things. 'Words are just words, but they do hurt. I used to cry all the time. I would just walk off crying. 'There is nothing you can do when six or seven people are shouting names at you. 'I wouldn’t have fought anyway, I can’t fight.'

Carrie, in yellow is pictured with her  sister Christine, in blue. Below are Adele and Robert . Carrie was protected by her father Thomas who had split from her mum and was not in the house on the night of the inferno. But Thomas tragically died of heart failure at the age of 50 on the 20th anniversary of the fire - leaving Carrie with no one from her own family left. And although she was grief-stricken at losing the last link with her parents and siblings Carrie has taken comfort from her own big family. Carrie on her wedding day in 2004, she is five-months pregnant and now has a houseful of children . She said: 'The children are my life - having seven little ones is a handful sometimes but I wouldn’t have it any other way. 'My dad used to say: 'I think mum’s looking down on you and the children, proud as punch. 'Now I feel as if both of them are up there as my guiding lights.' Carrie, who is scarred the length of her body and she has no toes on her left foot, had the last of her skin graft operations four years ago. She said: 'The scars are on my back, my front, my legs, my arms, my head. 'But they have made me the person I am today. I am strong.' The blaze left Carrie with a fear of fire and when Bonfire night comes around the family stays at home indoors. Carrie said: 'I have never lit a match. I’m too scared. What happens if it drops? I couldn’t do it. 'You won’t catch me lighting a firework for the children, even sparklers are a no go area.' Carrie . split from the father of her first six children - and the latest of her . brood, baby Lucas, came along after she started a new relationship. The mum-of-seven is now studying health and social studies at a local college to get a career as her children grow up. She said: 'I want to be a nurse. I have spent most of my life in and out of hospital and I would like to give something back. 'I am trying to make the best of my life and I want my children to have what I didn’t. 'I’m the same age as my mum when she died and I look at our life as a family. I’m so grateful. 'I grew up without my mum around so I always remind my kids how lucky they are to have a loving mother.

But Claire Forlani, who is married to actor Dougray Scott, makes a mealy-mouthed attempt in her latest advert for a leading whisky. She plays a temptress in the Dewar’s whisky promotion, which have drawn criticism because of the 40-year-old English-Italian’s cringe-inducing accent. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Unconvincing: Forlani's hammy acting and poor attempt at a Scottish accent have been the subject of criticism . Stereotype: Forlani rolls her 'R's in an attempt to get master the regional accent and refers to a man called 'Angus' US audience: The campaign for Dewar's has not been released outside the States. The agency behind the ad has defended Forlani . The latest advert, for Dewar’s . Highland Honey blend, shows Forlani standing at the window of a . brick-facade apartment, looking seductively into the camera and purring: . 'You should be asking yourself - what is sweetness without a little . bite?' Oddly, the actress is then stung by a bee that lands on her finger. She uses her stung finger to stir her glass of whisky, and tastes the blend. She then looks behind her into the apartment and says to a character off camera: 'Be careful Angus.' Screen Siren: Forlani has had success in the past starring opposite Brad Pitt in the 1998 film Meet Joe Black . Scotland's favourite export: Dougray Scott, 47 from Fife and has come close to bagging the role of Wolverine and James Bond . The advert is Dewar’s third featuring Forlani, the first being released in October 2012 and a second in December 2012. The campaign, which is only aired in America, has Forlani referring to a mystery man named Angus at the end of each commercial. The . first two Dewar’s ads drew criticism for Forlani’s ropey Scottish . accent and the script, which talks confusingly about the benefits of . being serious and going too fast. The . American ad agency Opperman Weiss, which created the campaign, explains . that Forlani entices drinkers as 'Dewar’s siren' with the 'presence of a . queen and the mouth of a gangster'. Lost in translation: Dougray Scott had an overly-formal British accent when he appeared on US show Desperate Housewives . Criticism: Viewers expected Forlani's accent to be better considering she had been married to a Scot for six years . They said: 'She has a strong, . commanding grip over the edgy, underground world and exudes her power . through her piercing attitude, cutting tongue and entrancing beauty. 'She draws the viewer in from the moment she is seen, enticing men and pulling them into her clandestine world.' Viewers from both sides of the Atlantic took to online forums to berate the original commercial. One annoyed American commented: 'Scots accents have been butchered in countless US shows and movies, but I tend to think of those as US attempts to fake a Scots accent. 'This is a Scottish distillery using a Brit to “sound” Scottish to the US audience. Just seems wrong.' Another poster said: 'I’m Scottish and that’s painful - she really overdoes rolling the Rs and her pronunciation of ‘benefits’ is very weird. 'But this ad wouldn’t go out in Scotland as is, since whisky is never sold as “Scotch” in Scotland. 'I really don’t understand the last bit - I can’t make out what she says, not least because it’s in a faux Irish accent. 'Whether it’s actually meant to sound like a Scottish accent, or it’s meant to sound like a Scottish person doing a bad Irish accent, I have no idea.'","Married to Scottish actor Dougray Scott for six years .

The Duchess of Cambridge broke down in tears when she was told that Nelson Mandela had died, it was revealed last night. She and Prince William were at a royal premiere in London of a new film about  Mr Mandela’s life when the news was broken to them. The Duchess, who was sitting next to William during Thursday evening’s screening of Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom, was said to be ‘very moved’ when she was told 15 minutes before the end  of the movie. And she left the cinema in tears, according to the film’s executive producer Harvey Weinstein. ‘Kate was very emotional, she was in tears and very moved by the events. We all were,’ he said. ‘There is nothing to describe the momentousness of what happened. The Duke and Duchess handled themselves very elegantly.’ But William was also struggling to contain his emotions, Mr Weinstein said. ‘I . spoke to them downstairs in the foyer after the movie. William was . deeply touched by the news, you could see it in his face, but he was . being very courageous.’ Mr . Weinstein said that it was poignant that William and Kate, who share a . passion for Africa and were engaged to be married in Kenya, were . representing the Royal Family. Arriving for the premiere, the Duchess had walked the red carpet in a floor-length white Roland Mouret dress. She . and Prince William had smiled for the cameras as they met the stars of . the show and Mr Mandela’s daughters Zindzi and Zenani, who had flown to . London from South Africa for the premiere. At 6.50pm UK time, minutes . before the gala screening  was due to start  at the Odeon Leicester . Square,  Mr Mandela died in South Africa. A . Royal protection officer is understood to have told Rebecca Deacon, the . Duchess’s private secretary,  who was also sitting next to her, that Mr . Mandela had died. Miss Deacon then informed the Duke  and Duchess. William . and Kate told their aides that they wanted to see the movie to the end . and they remained in their seats until the credits rolled. ‘Zindzi . and Zenani left as soon as they heard the news, but they did not want . to stop the screening,’ Mr Weinstein said. ‘William and Kate said they . wanted to watch the movie and stayed until the end. We all did. It . seemed the right thing to do.’ Moving: Prince William paid tribute to Nelson Mandela alongside the Duchess of Cambridge following last night's film premiere of Mandela: The Long Walk to Freedom, where the couple were told after they saw it . The Duke and Duchess were sitting a few seats away from the British actor Idris Elba, who plays Mr Mandela, and Naomie Harris, who plays the leader’s ex-wife Winnie. As the credits started rolling, the audience rose for a standing ovation. At this point the Royal couple were escorted out of  the upper circle and downstairs into the foyer by their  security team. In the auditorium the invited audience were cheering and clapping, most unaware that Mr Mandela had died. Then an emotional  Mr Elba, film director Justin Chadwick and the producer Anant Singh came down from the upper  circle to address  the audience. ‘President Zuma has announced the passing of Madiba,’ Mr Singh told a now silent audience. ‘President Zuma said Madiba had departed and was at peace. Our nation has lost its greatest son.’ Tears: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were visibly upset when they left the premiere of Mandela: A Long Walk To Freedom . As the credits continued to roll,  Mr Singh asked for a minute’s silence. Many of the guests, who were dressed in black tie for a planned after-party, were in tears. Many were still crying as they spilled into the chilly foyer. The film-makers agreed to cancel the after-party as a mark of respect to Mr Mandela. The movie is due  to be released in the UK on January 3.  It has already broken box office records  in South Africa. Nelson Mandela’s funeral cortege will travel through the streets of South Africa’s capital for three consecutive days ahead of his burial. In what will be remarkable scenes, thousands of mourners are being urged by the government to line the route and ‘form a public guard of honour’. The cortege will leave a military hospital on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday mornings to go to the Union Buildings  in Pretoria, the official seat of government and administrative capital, where Mr Mandela  will lie in state in a glass-topped coffin. Deparing: The flag-covered coffin caring the body of Mr Mandela is pictured in Johannesburg on Thursday . There, South Africans will have the opportunity to file past his body and say a final farewell, but, amid tight security, they will not be allowed to bring phones or cameras inside. ‘We call on members of the public to co-operate with the authorities to ensure that this event is dignified and secure,’ said government minister Collins Chabane yesterday. In  a state funeral that may even eclipse that of Princess Diana in 1997, world leaders will arrive  in South Africa this week for  the ‘ten-day remembrance’  of the former president. A set-piece memorial service will be held on Tuesday. It was originally scheduled to be held in Pretoria but due to demand was moved to a football stadium in Soweto. It is expected to be led by Mr Mandela’s friend, Desmond Tutu. Tributes: Mourners place flowers outside the South Africa home of Mr Mandela in Houghton, Johannesburg . Bright colours: People dance during a gathering of mourners on Vilakazi Street in Soweto, where the former South African President Nelson Mandela resided when he lived in the township . In what could turn into a logistical nightmare, heads of state from around the world are also invited to the funeral next Sunday, which is being held in Mr Mandela’s isolated home village of Qunu, Eastern Cape. The 95-year-old anti-apartheid icon will be buried in a family plot alongside his children who predeceased him. David Cameron and Prince Charles – and possibly the Queen – are expected to fly to South Africa but it is not known if they will travel to Qunu.

The Royal couple used to regularly enjoy Wednesday night suppers of shepherd’s pie and claret up at ‘the big house’ (as the stately pile, Bodorgan Hall, is known) with the admirably discreet Meyrick family. The farmhouse is in an isolated but breathtakingly scenic position above the Irish Sea, surrounded by private land and overlooking a small beach, accessible only by an hour-long cross-country hike. In the garden, there is a gas-fired barbecue, which was put to good use by the couple in summer.William openly shared the house with Kate even before their marriage, although she retained her London pied-a-terre for the sake of appearances.","Duke and Duchess upset neighbours with new tiles on mansion .

North Korean tyrant Kim Jong-Un was 'very drunk' when he gave the order that a pair of aides close to his executed uncle should be killed. The North Korean dictator ordered troops to round-up hundreds of relatives and associates of Jang Song-Thaek, who was shot On December 12 after being accused of plotting to overthrow the government. The leader ordered the executions after they did not hand business to the military - a move which left the dictator 'upset', according to reports in the Japanese media. North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, (centre right), pictured his wife, Ri Sol-Ju, (centre left), ordered the death of two aides believed to be loyal to his executed uncle while extremely drunk, it has been reported . The aides have been named as Ri Ryong-ha, the first deputy director of the administrative department of the state's ruling Workers' Party, and Jang Su-gil, a deputy director in the same department. The pair are believed to have joined the grim toll of Jang's aides - eight are believed to have been executed since the purge, Yomiuri Shimbun added.

It is not known whether she was among those rounded up . According to The Sunday Telegraph a source told the Daily NK newspaper, which is run by defectors of the regime, that they believed even relatives living away from Pyongyang were not safe under the circumstances. They also told the newspaper that close relatives as well as distant family members were taken away, including relatives of Song-Thaek's father. Kim Jong Un's former mentor Mr Song-Thaek was charged with 24 offences. These included abusing his position of power and 'dreaming different dreams' to the regime. North Korea stunned . the world by announcing the execution of the man once seen as the dictator's political regent. His death marks the biggest political upheaval since the 30-year-old inherited power. The Kim dynasty has ruled the isolated country for more than six decades. Mr Song-Thaek is the husband of Jong Un's biological aunt, the sister of his father Kim Jong Il. The source added: 'Jang's crimes are 'anti-party, counter-revolutionary factionalism,' so of course they will have to say that his family challenged the system. 'For this reason, severe punishment awaits.' Agents at South Korea's National Intelligence Service have a number of theories about the purge, which many believe was the chilling final act of a power struggle. But Jeong Chung-rae, a lawmaker from the United Democratic Party, said the head of the agency, Nam Jae-joon, played down the theory of a simple power grab. Jang's death may have been ordered because he had acted outside his authority over business deals involving the export of the secretive nation's coal - an abundant and lucrative resource - angering some officals in other departments. Jang was purged for violating the supreme leadership, according to the NIS report,' Jeong said, CNN reported. North Korea state media has made some vague references to corrupt business practices by Jang when they extensively listed his crimes.","Japanese news reports say dictator was angry over military contracts .

Resignation: Assistant prosecutor John Quarenghi quit his job to save his office from embarrassment . A top county prosecutor in Missouri has resigned after a federal investigation into a 26-year-old paralegal turned up intimate photos, texts and voicemails they had exchanged. John Quarenghi, 48, an assistant prosecutor in St Louis County's Prosecuting Attorney's Office, stepped down in December to save his office from embarrassment after the messages came to light. They emerged during an investigation into Jillian Nichols, a paralegal who allegedly told an accused sex offender that she could get favoritism from an assistant prosecutor for $10,000. Authorities will not say if Quarenghi was the prosecutor she was referring to, but he regularly works on sex offender cases and had been on several dates with Nichols by that point. U.S. Attorney Richard Callahan would not say whether Nichols had been referring to Quarenghi but emphasized that the prosecutor in question had absolutely no part in her alleged bribery scheme, the Salt Lake Post-Dispatch reported. Neil Bruntrager, Quarenghi's attorney, added: 'Obviously, we know he never did anything wrong. Either illegal or unethical. Obviously, he had no idea what her intentions were.'

The prosecutor believed that their relationship was 'maturing' and, after she initiated it, he sent her intimate texts and photographs.

"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 08:24 EST, 8 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:36 EST, 8 December 2013 . Salma Hayek and her billionaire Parisian husband are hunting for a new home in London, sparking suggestions they are set to join 'l'exodus' of wealthy French to countries with lower taxes. The Hollywood star, 47, and her 51-year-old husband François-Henri Pinault, owner of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, are said to be scouring Belgravia, Kensington and Notting Hill for a family home. Their search comes as a number of French tycoons have indicated they are preparing to leave their home country following a crackdown on high earners by Socialist president François Hollande. Salma Hayek and Francois-Henri Pinault, . pictured last year: The couple are reportedly searching for a family home . in London, sparking speculation that they are set to join 'l'exodus' of . wealthy French fleeing high taxes . The actor Gérard Depardieu was recently granted Russian citizenship and the fashion tycoon Bernard Arnault has applied for residency in Belgium, although he denies he plans to move his financial affairs to the country. Likewise Kering, the luxury conglomerate in which Mr Pinault holds a controlling stake, confirmed that the couple intended to rent a house in London but insisted he would still pay tax in France. Residency has become a sensitive issue in the country after President Hollande proposed a punitive 75 per cent tax on people earning more than €1m (£840,000) a year. The tax, which has been included in a draft budget for next year and is planned to apply for two years, sent shockwaves through the French business community. But many of those wealthy individuals who threatened to leave the country have backed down, at least publicly, after a backlash which accused them of a lack of patriotism. After Gérard Depardieu handed back his French passport and moved to Russia he later said he loved France as much as ever and the controversy over his departure was 'a big misunderstanding', The Times reported. It came after the actor, who has made more than 150 films, wrote an open letter to France's prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault last year explaining why he was leaving his native country. He wrote: ‘I am leaving because you consider that success, creation, talent, anything different, must be punished.’ In August, he said he considered himself a 'citizen of the world' after a Belgian town made him an honorary citizen. Also fleeing: French film star Gérard Depardieu, left, handed back his French passport and moved to Russia, while LVMH chief executive Bernard Arnault, right, transferred his family's wealth to Belgium . Bernard Arnault, head of luxury goods group LVMH - which includes the brands Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Guerlain, Moet & Chandon and Hennessy - officially transferred his assets to Belgium in January. He had applied for a Belgian passport soon after the Socialists won elections in France last year. The move involved transferring his 31 per cent stake in Groupe Arnault, the family holding that controls LVMH, to Pilinvest, a Belgian firm that he specifically set up for the purpose. Family home: Hayek with her daughter Valentina Pinault shortly after her birth in 2007. Eighteen months later she married Mr Pinault, the girl's father . Mr Arnault insisted at the time that he wanted merely to keep the £5.5billion-stake in LVMH in the hands of his five children after he dies. Belgium has a much more lenient tax regime than France – raising an inheritance tax of three per cent, compared to 11 per cent in France. Unlike France, there is no wealth tax in Belgium either. Hayek was seen leaving a Claridge's hotel in Mayfair with a leading property agent on Thursday, according to The Sunday Times. Kering confirmed to the paper that she and Pinault, who have one daughter, intended to rent a house in London 'for personal reasons'. The company insisted Pinault would remain a tax-paying French citizen. 'Kering is a Euronext Paris-listed group with global operations,' a spokesman told The Sunday Times. 'Its registered headquarters is in Paris and the group plans to move into a new headquarters building in Paris in 2015.' Mr Pinault was introduced to Hayek, who has been described as the world's most beautiful woman, by a former Gucci executive and married in Paris on Valentine's Day 2009 - 18 months after their daughter was born. Mr Pinault already had two children by his first wife and a third by Canadian supermodel Linda Evangelista. He took over the running of his father's business empire, then called PPR, ten years ago. His family also own the auction house Christie's, Chateau Latour, a vineyard in Bordeaux, and French football club Stade Rennais. He told the Evening Standard in March: 'London is hot. For now, all the new designers are coming from London. This could be a weakness for France, as I do not see the same depth of new talent here in Paris.'","Hayek spotted leaving Claridge's in Mayfair with a top property agent .

Revealed: Paul Walker, who made millions of dollars from the Fast & Furious franchise, was forced to live on the streets in college . A social worker has revealed for the first time about the impact Paul Walker’s stint on the streets had on his life. Ken Williams met the Fast and Furious star nearly five years ago when Paul and business partner Brandon Birtell came to him with the idea of doing a documentary about the homeless problem in Paul’s hometown of Santa Barbara, California. It was only after discussing the issue in depth that Paul and Brandon both revealed they lived on the streets as students. The 40-year-old, who tragically lost his life in a car crash on November 30, studied Marine Biology at California Community College. Ken says: ‘Brandon and Paul were homeless for a while in college and related to the issue. Brandon mentioned that he had been living out his car and a lot of students lived out of cars or in homeless shelters, they still do now, as they can’t afford the tuition fees, there’s no such thing as food stamps, and rents are so high. ‘They said it was for a brief time and they knew it was a world of difference to the people that live on the streets for virtually their whole life. 'But this made them really interested in the subject, it bothered them, and they picked Santa Barbara, where you see it all the time. There are so many mentally ill people on the streets, it’s heartbreaking.’ The sounds of high-performance car engines filled the air Sunday as more than 5,000 fans, friends and car enthusiasts headed to the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita to pay tribute to Walker at the site where the 'Fast & Furious' actor died in a car crash. The memorial, planned through social media, was scheduled to begin at noon, but mourners began arriving hours beforehand to leave flowers, candles, stuffed animals and other tributes. After speaking to Ken, who’s been a social worker and campaigner in the area for the last 35 years, they realized the problem was much deeper and more complex than they could ever imagine. The trio filmed for a year in 2009 centering on four people – three women and a blind old man called 'Pops' – who were sleeping rough and being cared for by Ken and his team. Scroll down for video . Walker's fans held a 'drive in' to pay tribute to the Fast & Furious star. Thousands of people and hundreds of cars and motorcycles turned out to pay their respects . Mourners: Thousands of people turned out for a memorial in Santa Clarita, California, to pay tribute to Walker and friend Roger Rodas, right, who died in the crash . More than 5,000 people came to the gathering, which was planned on social media. It was set to begin at noon Sunday, but hundreds of people lined up hours early . ‘They wanted to follow me around, as they wanted to see the homeless through their eyes. They didn’t want the people who were being filmed to be conscious of it. They wanted to concentrate on the town as it has this huge homeless population and it also has this massive wealth. We have a city as rich as Santa Barbara and they let Pops live on the streets. Unbelievable. ‘I found Pops on the streets and we had to carry him into the homeless shelter. Most people don’t want to touch the homeless; they’re like lepers. But Brandon was the one who lifted him up and took him on his shoulders to take him to the shelter. ‘The homeless are treated like a hidden wound and it grated on the guys that there is all this wealth in the area, all these celebrities, and also Third World poverty, which everyone just blindly accepts. ‘You just don’t usually get that empathy out of Hollywood. We have lots of celebrities who live here and you don’t get that sort of compassion.’ Activist: Ken Williams, a social worker who helps look after the homeless population in Santa Babara, was impressed by Walker's passion . Even though Paul was also busy filming the third installment of the Fast and Furious franchise, he was still heavily involved in producing the documentary and even had time to turn up to Ken’s book launch, a novel about a Vietnam veteran. ‘In the middle of filming, I released a book called China White and, out of nowhere, both Brandon and Paul turn up to the launch. Paul’s in jeans and a baseball cap, he was just so unassuming. 'But he said he understood the book, as his dad is a Vietnam vet. I couldn’t believe, who am I? I’m a no one. ‘But that’s Paul. They were doing this documentary and Paul was having to commute from Brazil where he was filming Fast and Furious. They really left their comfort zone to do this. They’d never done anything like it and it wasn’t going to get them any kudos. ‘For Paul, I go back to how humble he was. He had all this other stuff going on, but he wanted to do this, it speaks volumes. It was so chaotic and difficult to do. 'I give both of them credit, there’s no more controversial subject in America, and they wanted to reach out as best they could, and they took time out to do it. They had no Hollywood ego. 'Three hundred people have died on Santa Barbara streets from the likes of hypothermia and just plain giving up. You get wet and you’re cold all night, you use drugs or drink so you don’t feel it and forget all your problems. No one cares - but they did.’ Unbelievably, Paul, Brandon and Ken all received hate mail for the work they did with the homeless. ‘It’s weird, people hate the homeless and people were writing to me, saying they loathed me. When we did this film, we got a lot of criticism,’ explains Ken. Down to Earth: Even the mega-stardom that the success of the Fast & Furious films brought to Walker, right, caused him to lose sight of his days on the streets . Walker died tragically last month when the $500,000 supercar he was riding in smashed into a light pole and burst into flames . ‘We had hateful comments, which gave me an even higher opinion of them that these guys from Hollywood were bothering to do this. ‘People were saying that the homeless are like pigeons, and you know what happens with them... you feed them, then the pigeons will overpopulate. They’d say it’s time to ""thin the herd,"" which means when there’s too much of a herd, then they bring the hunters into kill them. ‘Others would say we don’t have a homeless problem, we have a Ken Williams problem. It’s disgusting.’ When the film, called 'Shelter,' was eventually premiered at in July 2009 and they held a charity fundraiser for the Casa Esperanza Homeless Shelter, which Ken has worked tirelessly for decades. Walker's teenage daughter Meadow left a touching tribute to her father on her Facebook page in which she called him her hero . ‘Paul’s like an angel compared to most in Hollywood. They never wanted special treatment and they put their neck on their line when there’s so much prejudice against the homeless. When the film came out, they put me down as co-producer. For me it was unbelievable, that means a lot,’ says Ken. As Paul knew from the beginning, Shelter would never even stand a chance of hitting the cinemas, but he was only interested in making a difference to the Santa Barbara community, says Ken. He adds: ‘It’s still being shown in classrooms, college campuses and community events, it’s made a real impact. 'We wanted to break the stereotypes and see them as human beings, demystify the homeless, and try to look at ways of solving the problem. They’re so badly treated - if you’re poor, you’re scum. It chipped away at the prejudice. ‘This says something about the problem that two of the four homeless people we filmed are now dead. It was amazing what Paul and Brandon did and if it makes more people take notice, then it was worth it.’","Fast & Furious star was forced to live on the streets when he was at California Community College in Santa Barbara .

Two young Mormons are to return home from their missions after learning that their family died of suspected carbon monoxide poisoning. Formally known as Latter-day Saints, Sister Jensen Parrish, 22, was based at the Washington Vancouver Mission, while her brother, Elder Ian Parrish, 20, was serving at the South Dakota Rapid City Mission. The pair have been released on leave after they were told that their mother, Ross, father, Bill, and brothers Keegan, 14, and Liam, 12, died over the weekend at their home in Pocatello, Idaho. Mormons Sister Jensen Parrish (right), 22, and Elder Ian Parrish (left), 20, are set to return home from their missions after discovering that their entire family - father Bill, mother Ross (both centre) and brothers Keegan (centre right), 14, and Liam (centre left), 12 - died from carbon monoxide poisoning . The Mormon pair have been released on leave from their missions after their siblings and parents died . Sometimes referred to as the ‘silent killer’, carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that has no smell or taste. Some 150 Americans die from carbon monoxide poisoning each year. The symptoms can be similar to those of food poisoning and influenza, with dizziness, vomiting and stomach pain often experienced. The gas is produced by fuels such as gas, coal, oil or wood when they do not burn fully. On Saturday, the manager of a popular Long Island restaurant died and 27 others required medical attention after a carbon monoxide leak filled a mall. Police said the deceased, Steven Nelson, 55, was discovered after a female employee fell and hit her head in Legal Sea Foods in South Huntington. The family are thought to have died from carbon monoxide poisoning on Saturday night or Sunday morning, though it is not clear which gas-based appliance is to blame. The alarm was raised after the four did not turn up for a weekly extended family dinner on Sunday night and would not answer their phones. Sister Jenson Parrish was 13 months into her 18-month stay where she was acting as an American Sign Language missionary, according to Deseret News. Her younger brother, meanwhile, was 18 months into a two-year stint and was a zone leader working in North Dakota.

Killer: Oba Chandler was convicted of raping and killing a mother and her teenage daughters in 1989 but now he has also been named the murderer of a 20-year-old woman found dead in 1990 . A murderer who was executed for sexually assaulting and killing three women in 1989 has now been blamed for a different murder a year later. Oba Chandler was executed in Florida by lethal injection in November 2011 at the age of 65, but detectives working on a cold case murder have found that he was guilty of another killing before being caught. Chandler was arrested in 1994 and charged with the rapes and murders of a mother and her two teen daughters who were visiting Florida from Ohio on a trip to Disney World. Joan 'Jo' Rogers and her daughters Michelle, 17, and Christie, 14, were last seen alive in June 1989 when they got lost on their way back to their motel. They asked for directions from Chandler and police believe that he then sweet-talked them onto his boat before tying concrete blocks to their necks and legs and dropping them in the water. Now police in Coral Springs have retested his DNA sample and found that he was connected to the previously-unsolved 1990 murder of Ivelisse Berrios Beguerisse. Ms Beguerisse, 20, was found dead on November 27, 1990 at the side of a road in Coral Springs. Scroll down for video . Cold case: Ivelisse Berrios Beguerisse was found dead at the side of a road in Coral Springs, Florida in November 1990 and the DNA that was taken at the scene was inconclusive until just new technology was used to test it . Sign of trouble: Ms Beguerisse's car was found with two slashed tires in the parking lot of the mall that she worked, leading police to believe that she had gotten a ride home from a Good Samaritan . She had last been seen at her job at a store called Swim Sports in the Sawgrass Mall and her car- which had two slashed tires, was found in the mall parking lot. Her car suggested to investigators that she could have been offered a ride home from someone that turned into a trap. 'It was always suspected that the subject had lured her into a vehicle as a Good Samaritan and then later killed her,' Detective Dan Cucchi said to NBC Miami. Chandler was familiar with the area of the crime, but did not live there at the time of the murder. ‘He had spent a couple months living in Sunrise, Florida just about a mile and a half from the Sawgrass Mills mall,’ Detective Brian Koenig said. Sole conviction: Chandler was found guilty and sentenced to death for the rapes and murders of mother Joan 'Jo' Rogers (left) and her 17-year-old daughter Michelle (center) and 14-year-old daughter Christie (right) in 1989 . Caught: Police were flooded with tips in the wake of the Rogers' murders but in 1994 Chandler (pictured) allegedly raped a Canadian woman who got away, and then she gave helped form a sketch of him for police . On top of the similar Good Samaritan factor and his connection to the area, the victim was also found with ligature marks on her ankles and wrists like those found on the bodies of the Rogers women. Missing: Ms Beguerisse's body was found by two fishermen on November 27, 1990 . DNA was collected off her body and after Chandler was questioned in connection to the Rogers triple murder in 1994, they also briefly considered him in relation to Ms Beguerisse's murder as well but the technology at the time could not connect the DNA samples. Detectives Cucchi and Koenig were assigned the Beguerisse cold case last summer and asked to have the DNA retested. On February 5, the results from the Broward Sheriff's Office came back saying that they obtained a positive suspect DNA profile. The news gives closure to Ms Beguerisse's family, but can no longer change the final punishment that Chandler received, as he was put on death row in 1994 for the murder of Mrs Rogers and her daughters, and then killed less than a decade later. He did not receive a single visitor during his years in jail, and there are mixed reports about whether or not he made a final statement. Some say that he did not issue any statement while more than 30 people watched him die, while NBC Miami reports that he did have some final words: 'You are killing an innocent man'.","Oba Chandler has now been named the main suspect in the cold case sexual assault and murder of Ivelisse Berrios Beguerisse .

A father has been forced to deliver his baby in hospital because staff were busy down the hall. Zaheer Ali, 36, was left to deliver his daughter alone at Bethesda Hospital East in Boynton Beach, Florida when the doctor and nurse rushed out of the room to attend to an emergency C-section. He helped his wife Indira as she gave birth to their third child, Aaliyah, who was luckily born healthy, weighing 6 pounds, 3 ounces, just after midnight on Sunday. 'I was scared, nervous, angry,' Mr Ali told MailOnline of the birth. 'Everything all in one.' New addition: Zaheer Ali and his wife Indira smile with their new daughter, Aaliyah. Zaheer delivered the little girl when their doctor and nurse left their hospital room to attend to another patient . Their obstetrician, Dr. Elana Deutsch, . returned to the room to find the newborn baby - and her upset parents. Deutsch had little more to do than cut the umbilical cord, the Palm Beach Post reported. Mrs Ali was full-term when she started getting contractions on Saturday evening, so her husband rushed her to hospital, where Dr Deutsch agreed to meet them. They were moved to a delivery area and the doctor felt as if Indira's labor was slowing down so gave her Pitocin to increase contractions. Feeling more pain, Indira asked for an epidural, but never got one as another woman down the hall was suffering a complicated surgery that called the Alis' doctor and nurse away. Left alone: The couple, left, were upset when their doctor, Dr Elana Deutsch, right, returned to the room. She also felt terrible, she said, and was shocked that Mrs Ali had given birth so quickly . Family: Aaliyah, who was born weighing 6lbs 3oz, will join the couple's other daughter and son . Dr Deutsch said she ordered the Pitocin drip to be stopped to slow down Mrs Ali's labor so she could rush and help the other patient. But the Alis didn't want her or the nurse to leave the room. 'My wife was screaming,' Zaheer Ali told MailOnline. '[The nurse] told us, ""Just breathe"" and that we had to wait because the doctor is doing a C-section and that takes priority over us.' The nurse left the room - and then it was all up to Mr Ali. 'Less that a minute later my wife began to scream and the baby began to come out,' he said. 'More than half the baby's body was out. I held the head and began to press the call nurse button.' He continued: 'After pressing the button no one came. I let the baby's head rest on the bed and ran to the hall, yelling for help.' Dr Deutsch said she returned to find the baby on the bed. 'It must have happened very rapidly, . because I was only in the C-section for 30 minutes,' she told the Palm Beach Post, adding . that she felt terrible about the mistiming. Apologetic: Staff at the Bethesda Hospital East, pictured, apologized and put the couple in a VIP room . 'The . patient was obviously very upset. I was very upset,' Deutsch said.

Penance: Eric Justin Toth, pictured, was captured in Nicaragua after a year on the FBI's 'Ten Most Wanted' fugitives . A Washington private school teacher captured in Nicaragua after a year on the FBI's 'Ten Most Wanted' fugitives list said he knew from age 13 that he was attracted to young boys and that his urges were 'dangerous' in a letter to the judge tasked with sentencing his child pornography case. Eric Justin Toth told the judge he plans to spend the rest of his life 'doing penance' for his crimes and said he wants to spend his time in prison 'as productively as possible,' including participating in a program to train seeing eye dogs. Toth fled Washington in 2008 after images . of child pornography were found on a camera he had used while a teacher . at Beauvoir, a private elementary school located on the grounds of the . Washington National Cathedral. The FBI added Toth to its Most Wanted list in 2012, where he filled a vacancy created by Osama bin Laden's death. He was finally caught last year in Nicaragua after five years on the run. In the two-page letter that was submitted to federal court Monday ahead of his March 11 sentencing, Toth acknowledged that he became aware of his attraction to boys when he was just 13. 'I knew society considered people like me monsters, so I swore myself to secrecy,' he wrote. He went on to apologize for his actions and said he has always known his urges were 'dangerous.' 'For . years, my brain manufactured one justification after another for giving . into my sexual urges. In more recent years, I've worked hard to change . that and continue to work on it in prison. In my heart of hearts, I've . always known my urges are dangerous,' he wrote. Toth's lawyers are recommending that he spend 22 years in prison. That's the low end of a recommended sentencing range agreed to by Toth as part of a guilty plea last year. Most Wanted: The FBI added Toth to its Most Wanted list in 2012, where he filled a vacancy created by Osama bin Laden's death . Toth's lawyers said he has no criminal . record, a history of psychological problems including depression and . that when he was in high school he was sexually abused by a teacher. Prosecutors . asked that Toth be sentenced to 30 years in prison. Both groups of . lawyers agreed that after prison he should spend a lifetime on . supervised release. Toth's lawyers wrote that he would like to serve his sentence at a New Jersey prison that has a program to train the guide dogs. Toth ended his letter by saying he . will 'commit the rest of my life to doing penance, to kindness and . decency, and to honest and perpetual accountability.' Toth . pleaded guilty in December to three counts of producing child . pornography, identity theft and misuse of a Social Security number.

Days after a California teenager sold dozens of cookie boxes outside a San Francisco pot dispensary, Girl Scouts in Colorado have been told they should abandon attempts to do something similar, despite the drug being legal in the state. 'Girl Scouts of Colorado doesn’t . allow girls to sell cookies outside of any adult-oriented business, . whether that is a bar, strip club, casino, liquor store or marijuana . dispensary. We . recognize these are legitimate businesses, but we don’t feel they are an . appropriate place for girls to be selling cookies in Colorado,' the . organization said. Scroll Down for Video . One smart cookie: Lexi Menees, 8, sells Girl Scout Cookies while sitting outside Trumed Dispensary, which sells medical marijuana for licensed patients, in Phoenix . The Girl Scouts of Colorado's decision . to prohibit their members from selling the organization's classic . cookies outside marijuana stores is generating mixed reaction on social . media. The organization . issued a statement on its Facebook page Friday to dispel rumors of Girl . Scouts setting up shop outside retail pot shops, effectively prohibiting . members from selling at dispensaries in the state, where recreational . marijuana is now legal. Carney . said she and her husband simply told Lexi they would try setting up in . front of a facility that is similar to a pharmacy, where people go to . get their medicine. 'She doesn't even know where she's at. It's more entrepreneurial,' Carney said. 'She's trying to go to camp this summer.' Some commenters on the council's Facebook page accused the group of hypocrisy for allowing sales outside of retail stores that sell alcohol and tobacco products. 'Grocery stores sell cigarettes and beer. Is it ok for them to sell the cookies outside of grocery stores?,' read one response. Tapping the market: Girl Scouts seem to be foregoing the usual supermarket stops for selling their beloved cookies . 'While I do not agree with Colorado legalization of marijuana, I feel that this is a huge missed opportunity to increase our sales,' read another. Other commenters applauded the organization's decision. 'If you want your kid sitting in front of a liquor store to sell something, do it on your own time with your own name, but please don't make decisions for my child and drag the name of [Girl Scouts] down,' one parent wrote on the Facebook page. But the advice may have come too late for some in other states in neighboring Arixzona, as eight-year-old Lexi Menees was selling her cookies outside the TruMed Dispensary in Phoenix on Saturday. The girl's mother, Heidi Carney, got the idea after hearing about what happened in San Francisco. 'For me, this isn't anything controversial,' Carney said. 'It's medication. It's no different than standing in front of a Walgreens or a CVS.' Munchies: Entrepreneurial Girl Scout Danielle Lei set up a cookie stall with her mother outside The Green Cross marijuana dispensary in San Francisco . Lexi and her parents came on Friday with between 100 and 150 boxes to sell. Her family said they sold more than 50. 'It's better than she would've gotten outside a grocery store,' said Justin Menees, Lexi's father. Susan de Queljoe, a spokeswoman for the Girl Scouts-Arizona Cactus-Pine Council, said selling in front of marijuana dispensaries isn't something the organization would encourage, but that it's up to the parents. 'The girls' safety is our primary concern. So we give guidelines out to all the parents and hope that they will follow them,' de Queljoe said. Lauren Gooding, an oncology nurse who is the president of TruMed, runs the state-licensed facility with her father and brother. Gooding said Carney called her Friday morning with the idea, and she was immediately on board. In fact, she had already received several messages on Facebook about the San Francisco sale with people suggesting she do the same thing, Gooding said. Gooding also sent a text message to more than 2,000 customers about the cookie sale and threw in a tie-in deal: Patients who buy at least half of an ounce of pot will have their pick of a free box of Thin Mints, Samoas or any of the other cookie choices. In 'high' demand: Miss Lei sold 117 cookie boxes in two hours standing outside The Green Cross last week . 'People will wait to buy when there are incentives,' Gooding said. She hopes the presence of the Girl Scouts will help eliminate the stigma tied to medical marijuana dispensaries, . Gooding said. Furthermore, with a security guard always on site to ensure nobody illegally consumes their pot purchase, there is no danger of Lexi or any child being exposed to marijuana, she said. 'We are not promoting medical marijuana to her,' Gooding said. Girl Scouts officials said they aren't surprised there are copycats after the story of 13-year-old San Francisco Girl Scout Danielle Lei went viral on social media and various news outlets. Lei set up a cookie table Monday outside The Green Cross, a licensed marijuana dispensary in that city's Mission district. Kevin Reed, president of the dispensary, said Lei's mother, a secretary for a city task force on medical cannabis, approached him a couple weeks ago. 'She wanted to help break down the barriers around medical marijuana,' Reed said. 'I thought it was extremely sweet. So of course with open arms I said yes.' Reed said this isn't the first time Lei has sold cookies in front of other pot facilities. She did it the last two years but is just now getting attention for it, he said. The feelings of Girl Scouts officials on the matter seem to vary state to state.","Colorado Girl Scouts are not allowed to sell cookies outside pot shops .

Petty Officer Third Class Anthony Marsiglia has been deployed on an aircraft carrier and is due to arrive home in Lafayette in the next few weeks, something his family, particularly his eight-year-old daughter, is extremely excited about. They made a sign that reads 'WELCOME HOME DADDY,' signed 'We love you. Mom, Pop and ALEX.' Deployed: Anthony Marsiglia has been away from home since his daughter was four years old . Homecoming: Marsiglia's family made a sign to welcome him back but were ordered to take it down by the Homeowner's Association . The family told KATC that they were sent a lengthy letter from the Home Owner's Association (HOA) telling them they had to take the sign down because it violated the association's rules - without specifying which exact rule the sign was breaking. Judi Pellegran, Marsiglia's mother said that she's bewildered by the demand. 'I'm just not quite understanding why it can't stay up and they haven't been able to explain that to me either,' said Pellegran.

This is how she keeps him in her heart everyday and clearly, if you see the house, it's a homage to her daddy,' she told the station. When Pellegran questioned the letter, an attorney highlighted a section of the homeowner's rules specifying that a sign may be no larger than 24 by 36 inches - but the family's sign is within those dimensions. Devoted daughter: Marsiglia's daughter Alex tracks his every move on a world map - and finally he'll be traveling to her door . 'I love him big': Alex says she's proud of her dad but wishes he didn't have to go away with the Navy . When notified of the size of the sign, the HOA attorney responded that 'The remaining problems are the failure of preapproval and the permanent display. The Board has met and advises that it does not allow permanent signs.' In a statement to KATC, the HOA said it has hired a mediator to work with homeowner Chester Pellegran, Marsiglia’s father, to 'create a dialogue in hopes of working out a solution.' The family is meeting with the association this weekend and hopes to discover the reason they couldn't have their sign up year-round, if they so desired.

Two Texas teenagers are suffering from a kidney disease so rare that it was only diagnosed when the oldest boy was 18. Jonathan and Christopher Naquin are both suffering from the life-threatening and incurable Alport Syndrome, but despite a succession of doctor's appointments their symptoms slipped under the radar. The genetic disorder is so rare, with fewer than 60,000 cases in the U.S., that medical staff struggled to piece together the symptoms. Rare: Carol Naquin with her sons, Christopher, left, and Jonathan, right, who both have Alport Syndrome . Genetic: Christopher and Jonathan's symptoms, including hearing loss, were not picked up until last year . Jonathan, 18, was finally diagnosed last year, after becoming so frail that his doctor feared he may have cancer. Fewer than 60,000 people in the U.S. have Alport Syndrome, a genetic disorder that attacks the kidneys. Early symptoms of the disease, which affects more men than women, is blood and protein in the urine. The disorder affects the connective tissues in the kidneys, but because the same tissue is found in the eyes and ears, sight loss and deafness are often early indicators of Alport. Alport causes scarring to the kidneys and, as the sufferer gets older, signs of organ damage become more clear. The syndrome, if left unchecked, can cause kidney failure in teenagers and young adults. Family history and a kidney biopsy are used to test for Alport. No treatment is currently available for Alport, though patients are often prescribed medication that can slow the damage. Kidney transplants and dialysis are often needed. At 6ft 2in, he weighed only 129 pounds and was pale. After being referred to Texas Children's Hospital, he was found to have a rare disease that attacks the tissues in his kidneys. His kidneys were found to be failing fast and the 18-year-old is currently on a transplant list. His brother's symptoms were not so  advanced and, for now, he has been prescribed medication. However, with no cure, both boys have been told to expect to undergo several kidney transplants in their lifetime. Signs that the boys may have Alport Syndrome were first noticeable before they were even born. Their mother, Carol, is believed to have passed the gene that causes the disorder to her sons. 'When I was 2 the doctors found protein . and blood in my urine. They did many tests over the years but they were . never able to explain it,' Mrs Naquin told ABC News. When they were growing up, her sons also both tested positive regularly for blood and protein in their urine, but the signals of Alport were missed. Even when they both lost their . hearing during elementary school - a common side effect of the syndrome - . doctors failed to pick up a more sinister problem. When . Alport was finally diagnosed the family struggled to find information . about it. When it was finally spotted in Jonathan, his parents were given a . printout at the hospital. Diagnosed: Jonathan's symptoms were recognized when his parents became concerned about his weight . Waiting list: Jonathan, 18, is waiting for a kidney transplant . Life-changing: Jonathan, left, and younger brother Christopher, 16, may need several kidney transplants . 'When they tell you your child has a . rare disease you know nothing about and then they send you to the . Internet, I can't describe the raw emotion,' Mrs Naquin said, adding that she felt anxious and guilty at first. Sharon Lagas, of the Alport . Syndrome Foundation, said that the family's experience was typical. The syndrome is so rare it is known as an 'orphan disease' because it affects so few people. Its symptoms are also found in other diseases, making an early diagnosis difficult unless it has already been found in another family members. But Dr . Clifford Kashtan, executive director of the . Alport Syndrome Treatment and Outcomes Registry at the University of . Minnesota in Minneapolis, said: 'Early hearing loss, blood in the urine and history of kidney failure are all red flags.' Campaign: The Naquin family, pictured above on vacation, want to raise awareness about the disorder . The syndrome usually begins by affecting the eyesight and hearing of sufferers, before moving on to the kidneys during the teenage years. For now, Jonathan and Christopher are getting the help they need to manage the effects of the syndrome, but both face needing several transplants and dialysis. 'If more doctors were aware of this disease, my kids' kidneys could have been protected much sooner,' Mrs Naquin said. 'A little more knowledge on their part would have meant a lot less heartache on mine.'","Jonathan and Christopher Naquin were diagnosed with life-threatening disorder last year .

The grandmother, who would only give her names as Lorel, said she went to the fast food chain in Richmond, Central Virginia, on Sunday night to buy dinner. However she was left horrified and upset after she was handed a receipt with the offensive phrase printed at the top. Offensive: An elderly woman and her daughter-in-law were handed this receipt at a Burger King in Virginia which labelled them as 'b**** a** hoes' In an interview with CBS 6 she said: 'This is more than an insult. I mean calling you names on a piece of a paper, that will hurt somebody. 'I liked going there. But after this they won’t get my business anymore.' Speaking about the manager, she added: 'He did apologise. He also called the young lady over and asked her, ""did you see this?"" She just shook her head. He said it had never happened before.' According to the TV station a dsitrict manager of Burger King said the chain was 'dealing with it', and that they were using CCTV tapes to try and track down the culprit. Lorel is not the first person to be insulted on a receipt. In April last year a father received the note 'f****** needy kids' on his bill after asking for an extra chicken leg for his son. The grandmother, who gave her name as Lorel, said she will not go back to the restaurant (file pic) Joseph Gibson stopped at a St Louis bar called Friendly's on a day out with his son when the incident happened. The store manager later apologised, saying a female waitress had put it on the bill as a joke, intending to remove it before handing it over. In November last year a lesbian waitress and former Marine also posted a receipt showing on offensive letter a family had apparently left for her instead of tipping. The note, left for Danya Morales, 22, at the Bridgewater Bistro in New Jersey, said: 'Sorry, I cannot tip because I do not agree with your lifestyle and the way you live your life'. Ms Morales then received thousands of dollars in donations after she claimed to be collecting for a gay rights charity. However following protests from the family, and no money being given to the charity, Ms Morales admitted the receipt had been a fake and was fired.","Woman named Lorel and daughter-in-law bought dinner at Burger King .

Another 28 people are going to be arrested throughout the day,  making this the second round of arrests in the wide-ranging social security benefits scheme. The plot was first reported in January when the Manhattan District Attorney announced that more than 100 people were arrested after being involved in a longterm plot wherein they claimed to have disabilities like post traumatic stress disorder in an effort to steal hundreds of thousands from the government. Being taken in: This is one of the 28 former police and firefighters who were arrested today for their alleged involvement in the benefit fraud scheme that stole up to $400million from taxpayers . Tarnishing the badge: The latest batch of suspects have not yet been named but are being rounded up currently . Not all of the latest 28 offenders have been named, but one has been identified as former police officer Sam Esposito, whose father Joseph was arrested last month after being labeled one of the scheme's 'ringleaders'. Of the latest arrests, 16 were retired NYPD officers, four were from the fire department, one was from both the fire department and then police department and another was from the department of corrections. Aside from those 21 individuals, there were seven others who were arrested today and the list of all 28 names was released publicly but it does not indicate which suspect corresponded with which agency. 'Last month’s indictment was the first step in ending a massive fraud against American taxpayers,' said District Attorney Cy Vance in a statement. 'Today, dozens of additional defendants have been charged with fabricating psychiatric conditions in order to fraudulently obtain Social Security Disability insurance, a critically important social safety net reserved for those truly in need. 'These defendants are accused of gaming the system by lying about their lifestyle, including their ability to work, drive, handle money, shop, and socialize, in order to obtain benefits to which they were not entitled. Under cover: Some of the schemers had been benefiting from ill-earned disability payments for decades . Waiting for the story: The DA has not yet released the names of the suspects but in their earlier round up of more than 100 recipients, they even told how they were determined to be falsifying their claims . 'Their lies were repetitive and . extensive. My Office is continuing to work with the U.S. Social Security . Administration to bring additional cases, where appropriate.' All told, prosecutors told The New York Daily News . that up to $400million may have been netted by the schemers, and it is . entirely possible that hundreds of others could be arrested. There were 102 people who were indicted as recipients in the fraudulent benefits scheme on January 7. The . recipients were a mix of 72 former NYPD officers, eight former fire . fighters, and other corrections officers all who made up different . physical and psychological conditions that they reportedly incurred on . the job. Some of the accused had been falsely claiming disability funds since the 1980s- with the help of four administrative ringleaders- while others only started after the September 11 terrorist attacks. Many were coached about how they could appear depressed or in the throes of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and others said that their work on Ground Zero led them to feel incapacitated in large crowds. The roles of the individuals arrested today and the bogus claims that they allegedly made have yet to be explicitly laid out. When the District Attorney's office made their case in January, they released photos of some of the accused blatantly showing off their wealth and behaving in ways that would been impossible if their disability claims were true. Glenn Lieberman, 48, was held up by the New York District Attorney as one of the poster boys for the widespread scam. Rounding them up: The 28 new suspects are being brought into the Manhattan District Attorney's office over the course of Tuesday- many of whom are now in the custody of their former colleagues . Walk of shame: This new suspect tries to hide his face using an Under Armor hat . The former police officer was living in a rented $1.5million  waterfront mansion that has a pool and access to a waterway where he parked his two jet skis at the time of his arrest. The officers were not the only ones in on the scheme, as The Post reports that some of the accused' siblings pulled the same move. Vincent LaMantia is one of the 102 indicted fraudsters, and his siblings Darrin, Karen and Thomas all told officials that they had psychiatric ailments that made it impossible for them to hold down a job. All told, the Staten Island siblings collected $596,000- with the largest portion- $287,000- going to Thomas as he began making disability claims in 2002. Vincent, 43, collected $148,000 and the remaining $161,000 was split between Karen, Kevin and Darrin. Many of the fraudsters left a virtual trail, including Vincent LaMantia who posted a motivational video online (which has now been removed) where he talked about ways to get rich quick. Sending a message: Glenn Lieberman is pictured on a jet ski, clearly not as incapacitated as he claimed to be in his benefit filing. He was one of the original 102 people caught in the first bust in January . Not so afraid of crowds now: Joseph Morrone, who said his post-9/11 fear of crowds kept him from working, collected $108,930 in payments and is seen here selling cannolis at the packed San Gennaro festival . Busted: Mike Scialabba (left) collected $232,443 . from the fund but also broke the rules by working as a helicopter pilot . and Louis Hurtado (right) worked as a martial arts instructor while . collecting $470,395 from Social Security . Active: Rich Cosentino collected a total of $207639 since May 2008 . Another such example was that of Joseph Morrone, who told authorities that his work after the September 11th attacks left him with a debilitating fear of crowds. On Facebook, he was pictured selling cannolis at the crowded San Gennaro festival in Little Italy. The suspicion is that there were a handful of 'crooked' lawyers and doctors who worked with the responders in question and were fully aware of how to 'game the system'. The four alleged 'ringleaders' were identified first, and it is clear that their positions within the NYPD and background in legal work helped them evade capture for years. Participants would start out by contacting John Minerva, 61, a Detectives Endowment Association consultant, or Joseph Esposito, 64, a retired member of the NYPD. Minerva or Esposito would then refer the fraudsters to one of two lawyers who were in on the scheme- Thomas Hale, 89, and former FBI agent Raymond Lavallee, 83. All four are charged with first and second degree grand larceny. The 9/11 disability claims are not the first that the four men have had a hand in, as ABC reports that they are believed to have been running disability scams since 1988. The lawyers put the schemers in touch with two different doctors- but not after some coaching.","Dozens more arrested in social security disability scam totaled $400million .

Firehouse Fire: Several firefighters from Westchester and Putnam fire departments work to control the blaze . A firehouse in Westchester county, New York, was destroyed after it went up in flames in an accidental fire. The fire broke out at the Goldens Bridge Fire Department building in the early morning, and the cause was believed to be faulty electrical wiring. Because the building had an automatic hard-wired smoke detector, it alerted other departments in the surrounding area, allowing them to respond and put out the fire. New York State Police said: 'At this time, the fire is believed to have originated from a faulty . electrical connection to a fire truck while parked inside of the . firehouse. Fire Commissioner Edward Brancati said that he and another firefighter were inside the building when they smelled smoke coming from part of the building. He said: 'There was a wall of smoke coming towards me and there was some sort of orange glow and then there was an explosion. 'It was very quick. I was stunned. 'We called 911. It’s embarrassing to call and say there’s a fire at your firehouse.' Firefighters from several different districts all collaborated after being alerted in order to try and put out the fire . After they called 911, Brancati and the other firefighter started removing vehicles and equipment from the firehouse, before Brancati was overcome by smoke, and had to be taken to hospital. It took tanker trucks from 17 other departments bringing in water to put out the fire, even after the entire 3,500-gallon tank at Goldens Bridge had been emptied. It took more than two and a half hours for the crews from the different districts to completely extinguish the flames, and afterwards the 3,500 gallon tank had to be refilled at a local reservoir. The fire caused significant structural damage to the firehouse, which has now been shut down until repairs can be carried out . In addition to structural damage to the building, a $500,000 fire truck and two 4x4 SUVs were destroyed by the fire. To help protect the area while repairs are carried out, Neighboring departments will cover Goldens Bridge’s territory, Haskell.","Blaze broke out at Goldens Bridge Fire Department in Westchester, NY .

Political power-broker, Gary Melius, the owner of Oheka Castle, was shot in the head by a masked gunman on Monday afternoon in the grounds of the famed Long Island hotel. The gunman shot Melius, 69, through the eye as he walked from the castle to his car in what police are describing as a botched attempt on the multi-millionaire hotelier's life. Melius was transported to North Shore hosptial in Manhassett where he is in currently in a stable condition and authorities are now examining surveillance footage from the Gilded Age estate on Long Island's Gold Coast that has witnessed the wedding of disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner and closing scenes of Orson Welles movie, Citizen Kane. Scroll down for video . Shot: Property developer Gary Melius with Debbie Gibson attend the 2nd Annual Gibson Girl Foundation Benefit at Oheka Castle on May 21, 2012 in Huntington, New York. The Long Island hotelier was shot by a masked gunman on the grounds of the castle on Monday afternoon . Suffolk County police said that they responded to a 911 call from Gary Melius's daughter at around 12.30pm. Kelly Melius rushed her father to hospital in the immediate aftermath of the shooting herself. Gary Melius was in surgery at a local hospital, and had been conscious and alert before going in, said Suffolk County Detective Sgt. John O'Sullivan. O'Sullivan said a call about shots fired came in around 12:30 p.m., and when officers arrived at the scene, they learned Melius had been taken to the hospital by his daughter.. Discovery: Gary Melius was found shot in the parking lot of his Oheka Castle by his daughter Kelly Melius - (pictured) who rushed him to hospital herself . He said that it does not appear to be an accidental shooting, but that neither the shooter nor a motive has been identified. Last year, Melius was part of a controversy that resulted in the ouster of then-Nassau County Police Commissioner Thomas Dale over the arrest of a witness in an election lawsuit. The district attorney found that Dale had instructed officers to arrest a 29-year-old Roosevelt man, who had testified in an unrelated case that he had been paid to collect signatures for a third-party candidate. Melius, a supporter of the third-party candidate, then contacted Dale seeking to have the young man investigated. The young man was arrested on an outstanding warrant while riding a county bus on October 5th. An investigation by the Nassau County district attorney found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing but raised questions about the ethics of Dale's actions, leading to his resignation. Melius was ""alert and conscious and cracking jokes' before going into surgery, said Sgt. John O'Sullivan. His close friend, former US Senator Alfonse D'Amato rushed to his bedside, later tweeting 'Friends, thank you for your kind words. Please keep my dear friend Gary Melius in your prayers.' D'Amato was waiting to meet D'Amato for a meal at a local steakhouse when he was informed of his friends shooting. 'It was not a robbery,' D'Amato said after leaving Melius' bedside according to Newsday. 'It was an attempt at assassination. He was at the Castle, outside. Nobody put a gun to him or said, 'We want your money.' They just shot him. The guy had a mask on.' Shot: A man identified as Gary Melius was shot in front of Oheka Castleon New York's Long Island . Indeed, investigators are now . examining Melius' political dealings in the hope of finding any clues to . enemies who would want him dead. Baffled friends have said that they are holding out hope that security footage will lead them to the culprit. 'I . know that they have video,' said Steve Schlesinger, chief counsel for . the Democratic Party on Long Island and a close friend of Mr. Melius. 'But I have no idea what that video shows yet.' Indeed, police have said that they do not believe the shooting was random. 'We have been racking our brains,' said Schlesinger to the New York Times. 'We can’t come up with anyone.' A donor to both Democrat and Republican parties, Melius has contributed millions to charity. Born in Queens, New York City, Melius began his career as a plumber, before getting himself into construction and property. Becoming successful, Melius made a move for Oheka in the mid-1980s.

In 2012, Melius fell into more financial trouble and was forced to . refinance his mortgage of $27.9 million, though he told The Wall Street . Journal at the time that business at Oheka was 'steady.' Able to attract the great and good of Long Island to his lavish hotel, Melius hosts poker games on the property - attended by guests such as former United States Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato. 'What Gary Melius created at Oheka Castle is a classic Gold Coast environment for virtually every boldface name who walks on Long Island,' said Gary Lewi, the former press secretary for Mr. D’Amato to the New York Times. 'Literally, people from all sides of the political spectrum have gone through the doors to either share a meal, smoke a cigar, play a game of poker and leave their differences outside. He has created a gilded, neutral ground for people.' Described as an 'up from-the-streets-guy', Melius' shooting has sent ripples through the Long Island political establishment. Melius is almost as well known for his involvement with the movers-and-shakers in politics as he is for Oheka. He crosses the partisan divide to boast friendships with Republican Congressman Peter King and Democratic Congressman Steve Israel - both of whom live on Long Island.

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for two teenagers who allegedly stabbed a classmate to death after they watched movies together - simply because they wanted to kill and rob him. Timothy Mosley, 19, and Austin Myers, 19, allegedly tried to choke Justin Back, 18, at his home in Waynesville, Ohio in January before stabbing him, shooting his body and dumping it under a bridge. A grand jury released nine indictments against the two teens on Monday and Warren County Prosecutor David Fornshell said he will be seeking the death penalty due to the cruelty of the killing. 'They set out to do this,' Fornshell said, Cincinnati.com reported. 'We believe it to be a situation where they simply wanted . to kill and rob Justin Back.' 'Killers': Timothy Mosley, left, and Austin Myers, right, both 19, allegedly choked and stabbed an 18-year-old classmate before shooting his body and dumping it beneath a bridge. They could face the death penalty . Moseley and Myers, who is listed as homeless in court records, visited the home Back - who was just days away from leaving for the Navy - shared with his parents in Wayne County on January 27 so they could prepare for the robbery. They then allegedly bought supplies so that they could make a 'clean kill', the told investigators. The duo returned to Back's home the following afternoon and watched movies with him before attacking him in the kitchen, trying to choke him and stabbing him repeatedly, investigators said. They then allegedly took a gun, a safe and some of their victim's clothing to make it look like he had run away from home. Myers allegedly shot Back's corpse with the gun and then the pair dumped his body beneath a bridge in Preble County, investigators said. Victim: Justin Back (pictured above), who had attended high school with Myers before graduating in 2013, had just joined the Navy and was two weeks away from moving to Illinois for training . Distraught: Back''s parents (pictured with Justin, second right, and one of his brothers) are in support of the death penalty for the suspects, the county sheriff said . Back's parents returned to the home and alerted police after finding items destroyed or missing and no sign of their son, who was about to move away for Naval training. Investigations uncovered that a violent robbery had taken place at the home and that Mosley and Myers had been there a day earlier. They were arrested and admitted to the killing. They are being held in the Warren County Jail on $1 million bonds. The indictments include two counts of aggravated murder, counts of aggravated robbery and burglary, grand theft of a firearm, tampering with evidence, safecracking and abuse of a corpse. Fornshell said he believes the grand jury included multiple death penalty specifications in the indictment due to teenagers' alleged premeditation. Warren County Sheriff Larry Sims added to the news site that he was pleased the death penalty is being sought. The decision was made with the support of the Back family, he said. Scene: Although the suspects tried to make it look as if Back had run away, investigators believed a violent robbery had taken place at the home in Waynesville, Ohio . 'The family is still reeling from this and they will be for quite some time,' Sims said. 'It's just going to be a long time for the family to move forward to some degree. I can't imagine too many things worse than what they've gone through.' Justin Back, who leaves behind two brothers and three sisters, had worked at a local McDonalds for three years before graduating from high school in 2013, his obituary said. He had been classmates with Myers at Waynesville High School. He had joined the Navy just before his death and was going to leave in two weeks for Recruit Training Command at Great Lakes, Illinois.","Timothy Mosley and Austin Myers, 19, 'robbed and stabbed Justin Back, 18, at his Ohio home in January - days before he was leaving for the Navy'

But this is no iPhone app. Instead an enthusiast has collated some of the planet’s most amazing artefacts and presented them in a space small enough to be held in your hand. Hans Fex says he has spent his life collecting things that have caused him wonder. These items range from an ancient palm tree from once-temperate Antarctica to coal from the wreck of the Titanic. Amazing collection: Mr Fex is selling tiny samples of his specimens, presented in a transparent case . The collection includes a human brain sourced from a laboratory in Russia which supplies plastinated humans for exhibits worldwide . Reality bites: Mr Fex's T-Rex tooth, which was collected on private ranch land and thought to have been shed while the animal was feeding . He has also amassed other unique items including a piece of the Apollo 11 command module, a piece of the original London Bridge, an Egyptian Mummy wrap, a dinosaur egg and lunar rock. Other unusual items range from a foundation brick from Abraham Lincoln’s house to hair from a woolly mammoth. The Mini Museum is a portable collection of curiosities where every item is authentic, iconic and labeled. Mr Fex's obtained foil from the Apollo 11 command module directly from astronaut Buzz Aldrin during a 2007 auction . Artefact: Coal fuel recovered from the Titanic, the cruise liner deemed unsinkable that sunk in 1912 after striking an iceberg in the North Atlantic . House about that: Foundation bricks from Abraham Lincoln's house . Mr Fex, from Stirling, Virginia, explains: ‘It’s been carefully designed to take you on a journey of learning and exploration. The idea is simple. For the past 35 years I have collected amazing specimens specifically for this project. I then carefully break those specimens down into smaller pieces, embed them in resin, and you end up with an epic museum in a manageable space. If you consider the age of some of these specimens - it’s been billions of years in the making.’ The majority of these specimens were acquired directly from contacting specialists recommended to Mr Fex by museum curators, research scientists and university historians. Hans has now smashed his fundraising target on Kickstarter and hopes to start shipping the Mini Museum later this year. They will come in three sizes - small, with 11 specimens, medium with 22 and large with 33. They will cost £60, £105 and £120 respectively. Hans is a professional product designer and says he got the idea for the Mini Museum when he was seven and was inspired by his father, a research scientist and a Director at the National Institutes of Health. Wool you believe it: A tuft of hair from a mammoth could be yours . The Mini Museum comes with a sample of London Bridge from the 19th century . The samples that make up the Mini Museum, with the large version containing all the specimens . He explains: ‘In 1977, the historic year of Star Wars and the Atari 2600, my father had returned from Malta with some artifacts that he had embedded into epoxy resin. I had never seen this done before and It was beautiful. ‘Then, all at once, I saw it - my first product idea: The Mini Museum, a grand collection within a manageable space. I was seven years old. ‘Several times throughout the next year I would discuss the project with my father and with his friends. These were researchers who had won Nobel Prizes and been knighted for their scientific accomplishments. They helped me refine the list to about 20 things we all agreed we’d like to have on our desks or in our pockets and they recommended ways of acquiring each of them - we even got on the phone and started calling museum curators for recommended sources.’ Hans had asked for $38,000 on crowdsourced-funding website Kickstarter, but has already seen 2,401 backers pledge $584,169 prior to the end date of 20 March. Mr Fex was recently part of Geeklabs, the custom product design and manufacturing division of online retailer ThinkGeek. Further explaining the Mini Museum, he says: ‘I’ve been imagining and building products most of my life. ‘I’ve spent the last year cataloging my collection, doing research, and experimenting with dozens of production and manufacturing techniques to make the Mini Museum a reality and I’m finally ready to share it with you. I’ve never been more passionate about a project in my entire life. ‘The collection starts with some of the oldest matter ever collected in the known Universe - matter collected from carbonacious chondrites. These meteorites contain matter that is over 4 billion years old. Other meteors include some that have skimmed off the surface of Mars or the moon and then landed on Earth - each of those containing matter from those celestial bodies. ‘What’s next? Specimens from the strelly pool stromatolites that contain the earliest evidence of life on Earth. Also, a piece of a palm tree from Antarctica - yes Antarctica. Everybody loves dinosaurs and the Mini Museum contains plenty of unique specimens from hundreds of millions of years ago including favorites like the T-Rex and Triceratops. Even dinosaur poop. Golden oldie: The most ancient matter ever found, from various meteorites, dating back over four billion years, forms part of the collection . ‘As we migrate from the beginning of the Universe to early life on Earth, we discover Homo Sapiens. Naturally, the Mini Museum also has many amazing and rare specimens documenting human history and culture. Mummy wrap, rocks from Mt. Everest, Trinitite, coal from Titanic,and even a piece of the Apollo 11 command module to name just a few. ‘It’s space and time in the palm of your hand. There is nothing else quite like it.  There are many more specimens for you to discover so make sure to check out the full lists below. ‘The Universe is amazing. I really wanted to remind people of that with this collection. How awesome would it be to own a group of rare meteorites, dinosaur fossils and relics of some of the most talked about places and events in human history?  All in the palm of your hand? ‘The Mini Museum is a portable learning tool, a smart and rare ice breaker, and a wonderful piece of historical art.

Three Michigan teens face life in prison after being charged in the murder of Michigan State University student Dustyn Frolka, 19, whose body was found partially-clothed on the side of a freeway on February 15. Prosecutor Chuck Sherman said 18-year-olds Samantha Grigg and Tyrel Bredernitz worked with 16-year-old Brendan Heim to rob Frolka for drug money, but ended up beating him to death with brass knuckles. Sherman believes the attack happened in the vehicle and that Frolka's body was later dumped at the side of the road. Scroll Down for Video . Dumped: Michigan State University student and rapper Dustyn Frolka, 19, was found dead on the side of a freeway earlier this month . Suspects: Saline High School students Samantha Grigg, 18 (left), and Brendan Heim, 16 (right) are suspected of working with Saline graduate Tyrel Bredernitz, 18 (below), to rob Frolka for drug money . Punched: Investigators believe the three teens beat up Frolka with brass knuckles. Tyrel Bredernitz, 18 . In addition to studying marketing at MSU, Frolka was a rapper and father to a 10-month-old daughter. The three teens were arraigned in court on Monday and charged with felony murder, armed robbery and conspiracy to committ armed robbery. Each individual charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Details on what led the group to Frolka are still hazy. Phone records show that the Frolka began communicating with the group a week or two before his death. However, Bath Detective Sgt Gary Smith told WLNS there wasn't a 'well known relationship established between them.' Smith says the driving force of the attack was getting money from Frolka to buy drugs, but authorities wouldn't reveal how much the group was after or if they were successful. Frolka was found unresponsive at 10:23pm near the East Lansing exit of Interstate 69. He was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. As of last week, the cause of death was still unknown though abrasions were found on his body consistent with hitting the pavement. After figuring out who Frolka was with in his final hours, Bath Township police searched an apartment complex in Saline where they found illegal drugs and arrested one of the suspects. Apprehended: One of the suspects was arrested last Saturday at this Saline apartment complex where illegal drugs were found . The two other suspects were arrested after police seized and searched the vehicle believed to be used in the attack. The investigation is ongoing and prosecutors say more could be arrested in connection to the murder. All three suspects have connections to Saline High School. In court on Monday, Grigg said she was a current senior at Saline High while Heim said he was enrolled but hadn't attended since finishing his sophomore year. High-schoolers: Both Grigg and Heim are current students at Saline High School,. Bredernitz said he graduated from the school . According to a 2012 Saline Reporter article, Grigg sang in a local rock band named Undecided. Brendan Heim is listed on the roster for the high school's football team. Bredernitz said he graduated from the school, while also relaying the fact that he was on probation for another case in 14A district court. Details on Frolka's life leading up to his death show that he too was dealing with drug issues. People who knew Frolka told the Detroit Free Press that he was at one point signed to a Lansing record label but 'had been on a kind of downward spiral' since last fall. Success: At one point, Frolka was signed to a Lansing record label but his life had taken a downward spiral since last fall, friends say . Father: Frolka's older sister says he was devoted to his 10-month-old daughter, and determined to make a good life for her . On January 31, Frolka was arrested by the MSU police for cocaine possession and was subsequently kicked out of his campus dorm - forcing him to move in with friends off campus. Older sister Pamela Hincka says recent mistakes shouldn't taint her brother's life. She described him as extremely generous and devoted to his 10-month-old daughter. 'He had goals of making it in the music industry — whether it was the business side of things or the talent side,' Hincka told the Free Press. 'He was working and going to school and trying to make a better life for himself and for (his daughter).' All three are being held in Clinton County Jail without bond and are set to return for preliminary exams on March 6. Each received a court-appointed attorney.","The body of Michigan State University student Dustyn Frolka, 19, was found on the side of a freeway on February 15 .

In development since 2009, the General Atomics Avenger is expected to have a top speed of more than 500mph, a 50,000ft operational ceiling and will be able to operate for up to 18 hours at a time. The news comes after Chuck Hagel, the defense secretary, announced plans to reduce the nation's army to its smallest size since before World War Two. Scroll down for video . This is the U.S. military's latest drone, the General Atomics Avenger, which will be able to kill from 1,800 miles . News of the drone's ability comes after U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced plans to reduce the nation's army to its smallest size since before World War Two . Under Mr Hagel's plan, which could be rejected by Congress, the active-duty army would shrink from 522,000 soldiers to between 440,000 and 450,000. This would be its smallest size since 1940. The proposal comes after President Obama's pledge to end two long-term military campaigns, including in Afghanistan. The U.S. could be forced to remove all troops from Afghanistan by president Hamid Karzai by the end of this year. According to Gizmodo, because of the forced pull-out, Afghanistan's remote regions are now out of range to conventional unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), making interdiction against the military in this area almost impossible. And without the use of Afghan airbases, which require protection from the military, conventional UAVs will not be able to continue surveillance and strike operations in north-west Pakistan. The Taliban has grown in this area since the U.S. announced it was pulling out of Afghanistan. The Avenger will be used to help the U.S. military gain access to areas that would otherwise be unreachable using conventional models. Able to be operated from 1,800 miles away, the drone will have a top speed of at least 500mph . The Avenger will be used to help the U.S. military gain access to areas that would otherwise be unreachable using conventional models . According to the Los Angeles Times, President Obama is also making contingency plans to use air bases in Central Asia where drone missile attacks on north-west Pakistan can be conducted. The new Avenger is a third-generation prototype of the Predator drone system. It uses a turbofan engine rather than a conventional turboprop, unlike its predecessors. The Avenger will match or better the capabilities of the Reaper, according to Gizmodo, with a top speed of at least 500mph, a 50,000ft operational ceiling and an operating time of 18 hours. It will also be the same length as the Reaper – with a 65ft wingspan – and will carry the same weapon load-out. The new Avenger is a third-generation prototype of the Predator drone system .

Police in Norway have rejected a complaint by mass murderer Anders Breivik that his treatment in jail amounted to 'serious torture'. The far-right terrorist who killed 77 people in a bombing and mass shooting on July 22, 2011, filed a formal complaint against the Norwegian Minister of Justice and a prison director, in which he said his daily body searches and outdated video games were equal to 'aggravated torture'. The complaint filed in January last year was examined by police but a preliminary investigation was closed on Monday according to police commissioner Ingrid Wirum. Convicted mass murderer Anders Breivik, 35, has had his claims that he is being 'tortured' in jail rejected by police . In this letter sent to media outlets Breivik complained he was being subjected to 'torture' because he had to play outdated video games and undergo daily body searches . ‘On this basis we have concluded that neither the prison in Ila nor the people mentioned in the complaint are guilty of any wrongdoing,’ Ms Wirum told AFP. Lawyer Tord Jordet told AFP his client Breivik ‘was not surprised’ by the decision, The Local reported. ‘He noted that the case has been closed despite significant documentation which demonstrates the violation of European prison regulations and human rights,’ Mr Jordet said. ‘It does not seem that the police wanted to investigate thoroughly.’ Breivik, who is serving a 21-year sentence, has repeatedly threatened to go on hunger strikes in protest of his treatment in prison. In a letter received by various media outlets last month, which was sent to prison authorities in November 2013, the right-wing extremist detailed 12 demands including the right to communicate more freely with the outside world and access to a computer rather than a typewriter. Breivik, who was recently moved from the Ila prison outside Olso to the Telemark prison in Skien, also demanded that his Playstation 2 be upgraded to a PS3 and that he be given ‘access to more adult games that I get to choose myself’.

The right-wing extremist says he has written a book providing new details about his bombing and mass shooting but prison authorities have refused to release it . ‘Other inmates have access to adult games while I only have the right to play less interesting kids games. One example is ""Rayman Revolution"", a game aimed at three year olds,’ Breivik wrote. Breivik also asked for an armchair to replace his ‘painful’ chair, his weekly allowance of 300 kroner (£30) to be doubled and his mail to cease being monitored and censored by the jail. ‘You've put me in hell ... and I won't manage to survive that long. You are killing me,’ the convicted killer wrote. ‘If I die, all of Europe's right-wing extremists will know exactly who it was that tortured me to death ... That could have consequences for certain individuals in the short term but also when Norway is once again ruled by a fascist regime in 13 to 40 years from now.’ In the letter, which was also sent to Norway’s anti-torture watchdog, the mass murderer also claimed to have written a book which is he is unable to send to a publisher. According to Breivik’s lawyer Mr Jordet the more than 1000-page book gives fresh details on the planning on his 2011 bombing and shooting rampage as well as reasons for the attacks.Breivik murdered eight people when he bombed the outside of a government building in Oslo and massacred another 69 people at a youth camp on the island of Utoya.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:27 EST, 25 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:22 EST, 25 February 2014 . As marijuana for medical and recreational uses continues to gain broader acceptance throughout America, health officials are worried that the drug's widespread acceptance is leading to an increase in traffic fatalities. Researchers at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health say that as marijuana use has become more widely accepted, fatal crashes involving the drug have tripled. 'Currently, one of nine drivers involved in fatal crashes would test . positive for marijuana,' Dr. Guohua Li, director of the . Center for Injury Epidemiology and Prevention at Columbia and a co-author of the study. 'If this . trend continues, in five or six years non-alcohol drugs will overtake . alcohol to become the most common substance involved in deaths related . to impaired driving.' Acceptance: As more people begin to accept marijuana use, experts worry there will be more fatal car wrecks . The study analyzed statistics from nearly 24,000 drivers who were killed in auto accidents between 1999 and 2010 and who died within an hour of the crash. Researchers looked at the toxicology reports of victims of these types of crashes in six states: California, Hawaii, Illinois, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and West Virginia. The study found that alcohol-related deaths from traffic accidents stayed consistent at about 40 percent throughout the decade, drug-related traffic fatalities jumped from 16 percent in 1999 to 28 percent by 2010. In the drug-related fatalities, 12 percent of the 2010 crashes involved marijuana. In 1999, only four percent of traffic fatalities involved marijuana. Legal: Marijuana for recreational use has been approved in both Colorado and Washington . The study acknowledges that just because traces of marijuana are found in a victim's blood it doesn't necessarily mean that person was impaired at the time of the wreck. 'The prevalence of nonalcohol drugs reported in this study should be . interpreted as an indicator of drug use, not necessarily a measurement . of drug impairment,' the authors of the study note. The study also reveals that a combination of alcohol and marijuana increases a driver's risk of dying in a fatal crash. 'If a driver is under the influence of alcohol, their risk of a fatal . crash is 13 times higher than the risk of the driver who is not under . the influence of alcohol,' Li said. 'But if the driver is under the . influence of both alcohol and marijuana, their risk increases to 24 . times that of a sober person.' Highway safety officials argue that as marijuana use becomes accepted even further, there could be an even further influx of drug-related traffic fatalities. MADD: Mothers Against Drunk Driving President Jan Withers echoes researcher's concerns that marijuana acceptance could lead to more deadly wrecks . 'The legalization of pot is going to spread to other states. It's not . even a partisan issue at this point. Our expectation is this will become . the norm rather than the rarity,' Deputy executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association, Jonathan Adkins, told Breitbart.com. Jan Withers, the national president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, has similar concerns. 'This study shows an alarming increase in driving under the influence . of drugs and, in particular, it shows an increase in driving under the . influence of both alcohol and drugs,' Withers said in a statement. 'When it comes to drugged driving . versus drunk driving, the substances may be different but the . consequences are the same -- needless deaths and injuries.'","12 percent of the fatal, drug-related crashes in 2010 crashes involved marijuana .

Three shots were fired at Wagoner - one struck him in the right leg and two were fired at his chest. Divine intervention: Rickey Wagoner, 49, survived being shot in the chest twice after his copy of The Message, a contemporary version of the New Testament, took the impact of the bullets . The two bullets aimed at his chest were stopped by a New Testament Bible that he kept in his chest pocket, reports the Dayton Daily News. ‘There was obviously some kind of intervention involved in this incident, because he probably should not be here,’ said Sgt. Michael Pauley of the Dayton Police Department. A police report indicates the rounds were nestled inside The Message, a version of the New testament written in contemporary language, which Wagoner kept in the left breast pocket of his shirt. Police believe the shooting may have been a gang initiation after Wagoner told investigators that one of the suspects said ‘we need to shot a polar bear to get in a club.’ Rickey Wagoner, 49, was assaulted by three men while he stood beside his bus in the early hours of Monday morning in Trotwood, Ohio . Polar bear hunting is gang slang for a random attack on an unsuspecting victim. Wagoner described the attackers as young black males, likely in their late teens. He said they fled in a dark-colored 1990s model Ford. According to Wagoner's police statement, the suspects approached him as he was trying to repair a malfunction with his bus. Two shots were fired at Wagoner's chest, then he wrestled the gun from the shooter but another round fired into his leg during their struggle. As they fought, another suspect stabbed Wagoner in the left arm with a knife. Wagoner then pulled an aluminum pen from his pocket and struck out.

After three-and-a-half years playing baseball for New Jersey's Drew University, a star player has come out to his teammates as he approaches his final season. Matt Kaplon, 21, didn't want to play a single inning in the last season of his college career until his team knew exactly who he is. As society becomes more and more accepting of homosexuality, there is still one arena in which it's a taboo: sports. Coming clean: Kaplon decided to tell his teammates that he is gay . Kaplon was painfully aware of that as he gathered his teammates together last weekend to make his announcement. 'Growing up in sports, you kind of hear this stigma that being gay isn't OK,' Kaplon told OutSports. 'That traveled with me into college.' And yet, he was buoyed by the recent coming out of college footballer Conner Mertens at Williamette University and Hillsdale College basketballer Derek Schell, the latter of whom he has become close friends with. Relieved: Kaplon feels that his friendships are stronger than ever since his revelation . 'Words cannot describe what Derek has meant to me,' Kaplon told OutSports. 'He saved my life.' Kaplon says that throughout his high school and college career, he'd heard homophobic slurs like 'faggot' or 'sissy' on-field, which served to further his retreat from the truth. He finally decided to come out to his family and friends after an experience last year. After being pursued, fruitlessly, by a young woman acquaintance, Kaplon was asked by his puzzled best friend, 'Are you gay?' Kaplon told him he wasn't. 'I lied to my best friend about myself,' he told OutSports. 'It made me think a lot about who I was and who I was going to be.' Weeks later he told the truth about his sexuality to his friend, whose positive reaction along with that of other friends and family members, convinced Kaplon that it was time to tell his teammates. Last weekend, as the team gathered in a classroom before going out to do community service together, Kaplon's coach Brian Hirschberg told the team there was something Kaplon wanted to tell them. He stood before his expectant teammates and said the words, 'I'm gay.' Being himself: After three-and-a-half years with his teammates, Kaplon didn't want to play another inning without being honest about himself to them . For a brief moment, Kaplon feared the worst from the silence that met his announcement. Then one teammate got up and shook his hand, saying, 'That was the manliest thing I've ever seen.' Applause followed and now, Kaplon finally feels that his team knows the real him. 'It's amazing to see how much more real your friendships become when you open up to them and let them know who you are,' Kaplon told OutSports. It's a sentiment his teammates echo. 'It's one of the best things he's ever done because it's made us closer friends. It doesn't change a thing. If anything, since he told me this really personal thing we've started hanging out more and talking about more serious things,' said second baseman Anthony Feltre.","Matt Kaplon, 21, announced to his college baseball teammates that he is gay .

Ford told the Today show: 'I don't use illegal drugs. I experimented with them probably a year ago, but I don't use drugs.' Ford was also caught on camera, clearly inebriated, speaking in a Jamaican accent in a fast-food restaurant in January. The video of the mayor, who only weeks before had claimed to have gotten sober, went viral online. Speaking of the incident today, Ford said: 'I've . been brought up with a lot of Jamaican friends. I drank and I enjoyed . myself... I can't remember what night it was. Maybe you're perfect but I'm . not.' In January, Ford was caught on camera drunk and cursing in a Jamaican accent while in a fast-food restaurant . Just this weekend, Ford was caught on camera running groin-first into a fire hydrant as he celebrated the Canadian Olympic hockey team winning a gold medal in Sochi. On February 1, Ford was seen at a Toronto bar when he disappeared into the bathroom for more than an hour. When he emerged, he was speaking in a 'nonsensical language,' according to the Toronto Star. He then remained at the bar and ordered drinks well after the city-mandated last call at 2am. Ford ultimately was stripped by the City Council of many of his powers, which were handed over to the city's deputy mayor. When asked by Matt Lauer on Today if he was still effective in his role as mayor, Ford replied: 'Absolutely. We had a major ice storm and I led the charge in getting power back on. 'There has been the lowest tax increase in years, saving taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars... we're building subways. We're on fire.'

A convicted bank robber who was being sentenced for a dramatic escape from prison using bed sheets and dental floss told the judge: 'Take your analogy and shove it'. Kenneth Conley smiled and winked as he listened to U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman give a lengthy explanation for sentencing him to a further three years on top of his current 20-year term. Half-way through, he put his hand up and told the judge to 'shove it right up your ***'. After a stunned silence, Judge Feinerman replied: 'Thank you'. 'Violent past': Banker robber Kenneth Conley has been sentenced a further three years behind bars for a daring escape from a Chicago prison. The FBI released this picture (right) of his tattoo to aid their search for him . Conley was led away to serve the extra 41 months of his sentence for a case that has captivated Chicago. A few days before Christmas 2012, Conley and his cellmate - fellow bank robber Joseph 'Jose' Banks - cut a hole in the concrete wall of the Metropolitan Correctional Center. Then using a rope made from bed sheets and dental floss, they abseiled down 17 floors in the middle of the night and hailed a taxi to freedom. Banks was arrested two days later, while Conley was at large for 18 days until he was found sleeping in a basement room of a Palos Hills apartment, it was reported by the Chicago Tribune. 'Ingenuity and gumption': Conley and his cellmate broke out of the Metropolitan Correctional Center (above) by cutting a hole in the wall and scaling down 17 floors with a rope made from bed sheets and dental floss . Judge Feinerman refused to hand down a concurrent sentence to Conley for the break-out because of his 'incorrigble violent past' that he felt was unlikely to change. He added: 'Doing what Mr Conley did takes brains, it takes ingenuity and it takes gumption. 'It shows that he is a force to be reckoned with.' Federal prison officials said Conley, 40, will probably now serve his time at the 'supermax' prison in Colorado, where inmates include Gangster Disciples leader Larry Hoover and Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called 20th hijacker in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Prosecutors dropped escape charges against Banks, who already faces 80 years in jail for a string of bank robberies.","Kenneth Conley smiled and winked throughout judge's sentencing remarks .

Deforestation data is updated in near realtime.Cloud computing, provided by Google lets people accelerate the speed at which the data can be analysed. GFW unites high resolution information from satellites with the power of crowdsourcing.The service is free and no technical expertise is needed. When forest loss alerts are detected, a network of partners and citizens around the world can mobilise to take action. ‘Businesses, governments and communities desperately want better information about forests. Now, they have it,’ said Dr Andrew Steer, President and CEO of WRI. ‘Global Forest Watch is a near-real time monitoring platform that will fundamentally change the way people and businesses manage forests. From now on, the bad guys cannot hide and the good guys will be recognised for their stewardship,’ he said. The world lost 2.3 million sq km (230 million hectares) of tree cover from 2000 to 2012, according to data from the University of Maryland and Google. That translates to 50 football pitches of forest being cut down every minute for 12 years. Russia, Brazil, Canada, United States, and Indonesia are the countries that have lost the most tree cover. The map shows forests of the world in high resolution of 30 metres and monthly tree cover loss data for the tropics at a resolution of 500 metres.

Users can choose to be alerted when a forest is lost, allowing networks of organisations and individuals to mobilise to take action against deforestation, GFW said. They can also use analytical tools to select layers showing boundaries of protected areas, as well as forest fire alerts from Nasa and biodiversity hotspots. It is hoped that GFW will have far-reaching implications across industries, enabling financial institutions to evaluate if the companies they invest in adequately assess forest-related risks. Buyers of major commodities such as palm oil, soy, timber and beef can better monitor compliance with laws, sustainability commitments and standards and suppliers can credibly demonstrate that their products are ‘deforestation free’ and legally produced. The tool is also designed to support indigenous communities who can upload alerts and photos when encroachment occurs on their lands and NGOs that can identify deforestation hotspots and collect evidence to hold governments and companies accountable. Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo are excited about using the tool as it can help them design smarter policies, enforce forest laws, detect illegal forest clearing, manage forests more sustainably, and achieve conservation and climate goals.

They say he survives on a wing and a prayer, but daredevil Espen Fadnes needed a little more skill than faith as he took on his latest breathtaking challenge. In this amazing footage Fadnes uses a wingsuit to pass underneath the arm of the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio, along with fellow adrenaline junkie Ludo Woerth. The pair flew up to 6,500ft on trikes - motorised hang gliders used to give tourists aerial views of the city - before leaping off. Scroll down for video . Breathtaking: Fadnes uses a camera fitted to his chest to film the moment he passed under the statue's arm, plummeting from more than 6,500ft . All clear: Christ the Redeemer can be seen over Fadnes' right shoulder after he passes underneath its left arm. The statue stands almost 100ft tall and has an arm span of 92ft . In his sights: Fadnes said the stunt was nearly called off due to wind, and that after making the decision to go ahead he was nervous and scared . The duo were supposed to be accompanied by Jokke Sommer, but only two trikes were available on the day so he had to be left on the ground. The jump was nearly abandoned in its entirety because of wind conditions around the statue, which could have blown the jumpers off course and caused a fatal accident. However, Fandes remained determined. He said: 'We did not come to Rio to not fly past the Jesus statue. When we made that decision I felt my heartbeat pounding and I became really scared and nervous.' After assessing the weather conditions and deciding they could make the leap, Fadnes and Woerth set off in the early hours to get the cleanest run possible. The best view in Rio: Fellow sportsman Ludo Woerth, from France, filmed the stunt by flying above Fadnes and using a camera on his chest . The dangerous stunt was completed using one of these specially designed wingsuits which slow down the wearer's free-fall speed allowing them more control in the air . A third man, Jokke Sommer (pictured) was also supposed to jump, but was unable to because of a lack of trikes - motorised hang gliders the athletes used to get into position . On the jump itself Fadnes was nominated to fly underneath the arm himself, as he was most comfortable in the suit, while Woerth flew above him and used a camera strapped to his chest in order to film the stunt. Luckily, the dangerous manouvre passed off without a hitch. The wingsuit fliers landed at a Rio roundabout in the early hours, before heading back to their hotel for a celebratory breakfast beer.","Extreme sportsman Espen Fadnes flew underneath the left arm of the Christ the Redeemer statue using a wingsuit .

They served in three wars, became known as Flying Fortresses because of their awesome fire-power, and during the Second World War they dropped more bombs than all other US army aircraft combined. Packed with high-explosives and bristling with heavy machine guns, the B-17 bomber earned a rightful reputation as a fearsome weapon of war. Today, however, there are only 14 aircraft still able to take to the skies, perhaps the most famous of which is the Movie Memphis Belle. Originally known as Memphis Belle, and later renamed after the 1990 film of her exploits, she was not only the first aircraft to complete her 25-mission tour-of-duty without being shot down, but she did so without losing a single member of her crew. All ten men who served aboard the aircraft escaped the war with little more than a scratch, a miracle in a profession famed for the short life-span of its members, and despite the Belle often returning to base with her engines shot out and riddled with bullet holes. Now the Belle has taken to the skies once again, complete with a crew of World War Two veterans who served aboard other B-17s during the conflict. The Movie Memphis Belle is perhaps the most famous of all B-17 bombers, as she was the first to complete her tour-of-duty without being shot down . Not only did the aircraft survive her time in combat, so did all ten members of her crew which is a miraculous feat considering the famed short life-spans of pilots during the Second World War . During the War nearly 1,000 B-17s could be sortied at any one time, but just 14 remain in flying condition today, including the Memphis Belle.

Mr McMahan described the experience as 'wonderful' saying the reliable aircraft had saved his life on two occasions, on both his first and last sortie . While the four-engine design of the B-17 may be outdated by today's standards, its huge bulk bristling with high-powered machine guns still cuts an imposing figure . For $450 the Liberty Foundation, which is now in charge of the Belle, is offering flights on board the bomber starting at DeKalb-Peachtree Airport, Atlanta, before stopping in Shreveport, LA, San Antonio, Texas and other locations across the US .

Survivors: All ten of the Memphis Belle's crew members survived the war and are commemorated in a picture mounted in the old radio room of the aircraft .

A woman is accused of killing four people, including her 19-year-old niece who was cradling her baby as well as two other family members and one unrelated victim. Cherie Louise Rhoades had been evicted from tribal housing because she was suspected of stealing from the tribe, the tribe's lawyer said Monday. Cedarville Rancheria attorney Jack Duran said Rhoades was suspended as tribal chairwoman just three weeks before the gun and knife attack, pending a federal investigation into allegations that she embezzled at least $50,000 in federal grant money. Scroll down for video . This Thursday, Feb. 20, 2014 photo released by Alturas Police Department shows Cherie Lash Rhoades who allegedly killed four and injured two . Rhoades' son, Jack Stockton, was ousted . as vice chairman and evicted from tribal housing on the same grounds, . Duran told The Associated Press. Stockton was not at Thursday's hearing when the shooting broke out. He does not have a listed phone number. Duran said the meeting in Alturas, California, was being held to consider Rhoades' appeal of her eviction. But at some point, Rhoades opened fire, killing her brother Rurik Davis, 50, who had been named interim chairman by the tribal council, authorities said. Also killed in the attack were Rhoades' niece Angel Penn, 19; her nephew Glenn Calonicco, 30; and Shelia Lynn Russo, 47. They were all members of the tribal council that evicted Rhoades, and Russo was the tribal administrator. Duran said Penn was holding her newborn infant on her lap when she was shot, but the baby was unhurt and will be placed with a sister. Davis' two daughters, Monica and Melissa Davis, were critically wounded, court documents said. Responding officers arrested Rhoades outside the building, where a declaration of probable cause says Modoc County Undersheriff Ken Richardson saw Rhodes stabbing one of the victims in the parking lot and handcuffed her after another person tackled her. The document adds that police talked to six people who witnessed the shooting. The two women who survived bullet wounds were also cut with a knife. A criminal complaint filed Monday in Modoc County Superior Court charges Rhoades with four counts of murder with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun, and two counts of attempted murder. She was to be arraigned Tuesday morning. District Attorney Jordan Funk said she will face the death penalty if she's convicted, because the complaint carries the special circumstance of multiple victims. Rurik Davis (left), 50, was the killer's brother and Angel Penn (right), 19, was her niece . Funk said it wasn't immediately clear . if attorneys had been appointed for Rhoades yet, because they would have . to be qualified to handle a capital case. The . Cedarville Rancheria is a federally recognized tribe with 35 registered . members. The Rancheria owns 26 acres in Cedarville, where most members . reside in nine small, one-story houses built in the 1950s on the . outskirts of town. In . 2012, the tribe received an Indian housing grant for $50,399 from the . U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to a news . release on the agency's website. Duran said he couldn't confirm whether that was the money in question, adding the amount could be less 'or a lot more.' Though . police have said they are still working on a motive, a nephew who lived . with Rhoades, Jacob Penn, said she snapped under the pressure of her . brother's attempt to evict her.

Alturas . Police Chief Ken Barnes said that as the shooting erupted, young . children were inside the building and on the property, and a judge from . another tribe was listening to the eviction proceedings over the phone. After . running out of bullets, Rhoades grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed a . woman, police said. She chased one of Davis' daughters out of the . building and into the parking lot while brandishing the knife. Sheila Russo, 47, an administrator for the Cedarville Rancheria Indian tribe, was one of four people killed when Cherie Lash Rhoades opened fire . The small town is home to the Cedarville Rancheria, a small tribal organization . There, she was tackled by the tribal headquarters maintenance man, Duran said. Both . of Davis' daughters were wounded. Officials said one was alert and . talking, while the other remained in critical condition Friday. The . tribe's headquarters - a ranch-style building with a pitched brown . metal roof and solar panels - is in a residential area about a block . from the police station. Police were alerted to the attack by a woman . covered in blood pounding on a side entrance to City Hall, which also . houses the police. The . tribe is busy cleaning the building, and it is uncertain whether it will . resume using the facility because of the slayings, Duran said. 'She . bullied her way through life,' said Sandra Parriott, a lifelong . resident of Cedarville and owner of two downtown markets, of Rhoades. 'But I would never think she would start blowing people away in a . meeting.' Eviction from . tribal housing is among the most serious punishments for American . Indians. Though police have said they are still working on a motive, a . nephew who lived with her, Jacob Penn, said she snapped under the . pressure of her brother trying to evict her. The brother, Rurik Davis, . who lived down the street on the Rancheria, had apparently taken over as . tribal chairman and was among the dead. Investigators . had been looking into whether Rhoades took federal grant money meant . for the rancheria she once led, a person familiar with the tribe's . situation told The Associated Press. The person spoke only on condition . of anonymity. Alturas Police . Chief Ken Barnes said they were looking into whether the embezzlement . allegations spurred the tribe's efforts to evict Rhoades but they had . not established any definitive motive.

The . investigation was no secret around town, where several people . interviewed by the AP mentioned it, though they said they had not been . contacted by investigators and did not want to give their names. Though . Rhoades was always ready to share a joke, 'you did not want to get on . her bad side,' said Penny Nash, Parriott's sister. 'She has a powerful . personality.' It was not immediately known if . Rhoades had a lawyer.

A Chinese man is suing the government for failing to halt air pollution, after he had to buy a treadmill to exercise indoors. Li Guixin, from Shijiazhuang in Hebei province, claims the authorities have failed to control the increasing smog, which has forced him to spend money on face masks and an air purifier as well as the treadmill. His lawsuit was filed as readings of PM2.5, a key measure of pollution, reached 444 micrograms per cubic meter in the capital of Beijing, nearly 18 times the safe level. Smog alert: A security guard stands on top of a hill in Jingshan Park in a haze-covered Beijing where the pollution has gotten so bad that it is blocking sunlight .

High-risk levels: A man is wearing a face mask to cover his mouth and nose in Tiananmen Square in Beijing where readings of pollution measure PM2.5 are nearly 18 times the safe level. The smog in Beijing is now so thick that it is blocking sunlight, despite recent announced closures or production cuts at 147 of the city's industrial plants. Mr Li submitted his complaint to a district court, asking the Shijiazhuang Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau to ‘perform its duty to control air pollution according to the law’, the Yanzhao Metropolis Daily said. He is also seeking compensation for local residents for the choking pollution that has engulfed Shijiazhuang, and much of northern China, this winter. ‘The reason that I'm proposing administrative compensation is to let every citizen see that amid this haze, we're the real victims,’ Li was quoted as saying by the newspaper. It is unclear whether the court will accept Li's lawsuit.

Monumental disaster: Two girls stand outside the entrance to the Forbidden City in Tiananmen Square in Beijing where pollution has reached hazardous levels . The National Meteorological Center has . raised its smog alert for northern and central China, with heavy smog . expected for another two days, state news agency Xinhua said. The dangerous levels of smog had has drastic effects on the nation’s agricultural industry, it was reported today. The polluted air is blocking out the sunlight, preventing photosynthesis and effectively choking plants and vegetables. As a result, crops are struggling to survive in the smog, which could have disastrous consequences for China where agricultural production contribute to some ten per cent of GDP. He Dongxian, an associate professor with China Agricultural University’s College of Water Resources and Civil Engineering, told South China Morning post that the country’s food production is under serious threat unless air pollution is not slowed down immediately, . Professor He conducted an experiment on chilli and tomato seeds, which would normally take about 20 days to grow into full-grown seedlings under artificial light in a laboratory, which saw it take more than two months for the seeds to sprout at a greenhouse farm in Beijing’s Changping district. Beijing . has been shrouded in stinking smog for more than a week and in an . effort to cut pollution, 147 industrial companies in Beijing had cut or . suspended production as of Tuesday, the Xinhua state news agency said. ‘Of . course, on days where pollution levels reach or even exceed the scale . we are very concerned and we have to see this as a crisis,’ Bernhard .

The 17-year-old girl charged with the January shooting spree that killed one police officer and wounded another made her first appearance in court on Monday, with her lawyers saying she is 'scared to death' staring down her maximum sentence of life in prison. Looking solemn and dressed in a yellow jail jumpsuit, Meagan Dakota Grunwald, of Draper, appeared in front of a judge in Provo, Utah, to face accusations she was high on meth when she and her boyfriend shot and killed a sheriff's deputy who was trying to help them with car trouble last month. Grunwald, who is being held at the Salt Lake County jail, is charged as an adult with aggravated murder, a first-degree felony, and 13 other charges related to the January 30 events. She is accused of driving her pickup truck while her boyfriend allegedly shot and killed one police officer and wounded another, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. Life in prison without parole is the maximum penalty the teen could face if convicted of aggravated murder. Because she is a minor, she is not eligible for the death penalty. Meagan Grunwald, 17, who has been charged as an adult in the shootings of two Utah deputies, makes her first appearance in Judge Darold McDade's court in Provo, Utah, on Monday . Police allege Grunwald was high on meth when she and her boyfriend shot and killed a sheriff's deputy who was trying to help them with car trouble last month . Megan Grunwald is being tried as an adult - and standing trial for the murder her boyfriend took out - because there was enough culpability . Grunwald is also charged with two counts of felony discharge of a firearm, two counts of attempted aggravated murder, and aggravated robbery — all first-degree felonies — along with charges of felony obstructing justice, failure to respond to an officer, possession or use of a controlled substance and lesser charges of felony discharge of a firearm, and misdemeanor criminal mischief and violation of operator duties after an accident. While 27-year-old Jose Angel Garcia-Jauregui is accused of pulling the trigger, prosecutors claim the teen girl is just as responsible for killing Utah County Sheriff’s Sgt. Cory Wride and wounding deputy Greg Sherwood. 'We think the culpability is such that she should be charged as an adult,' Deputy Utah County Attorney Sam Pead said outside of court. Prosecutors have said that the teen was an 'active participant' in the alleged crimes. Zabriskie said the teen is 'scared to death'. 'Being locked up in an adult environment with these serious charges is very traumatizing for her,' he said. Unprovoked: Utah County Sheriff's Deputy Cory Wride was shot dead by Grunwald's boyfriend after trying to help the couple he thought was having car troubles . Crime couple: The chase ended when sheriff's deputies shot Jose Angel Garcia-Juaregui (left) in the head and his girlfriend Grunwald (right)  was arrested. Garcia-Juaregui died the following day in the hospital . Mourning: Family, friends and fellow police officers attend the funeral of Cory Wride in Spanish Ford Cemetery on February 5 . Tragic loss: Wride's wife Nanette (right) is comforted by her son Shea at the funeral . Documents filed in court shed light on the dramatic crime spree that ended in death on I-15 roadway last month. Wride stopped to help Grunwald and her boyfriend around 1pm because he thought they were having car trouble and wanted to help. Grunwald . was driving the car with her boyfriend in the passenger's seat. She . gave Wride her driver's license but Garcia-Juearegui gave the officer a . false name. Wride went . back and forth between the pick-up truck registered to Grunwald's mother . and his squad car three times, trying to figure out Garcia-Juaregui's . actual identity. It was while sitting in his squad car that Garcia-Juaregui opened the rear window of the truck's cab and started shooting at the officer and his girlfriend sped off. Wride died and his body wasn't found until 45 minutes later when another deputy was sent out to check up on him. Fellow deputy Greg Sherwood tracked the couple's truck down around 3pm and attempted to pull the couple over. But Grunwald wouldn't stop, and actually 'aggressively applied the brakes' to shorten the distance between the two vehicles while her boyfriend started shooting. Garcia-Juregui hit Sherwood in the head, critically injuring the officer. Sherwood eventually recovered from the injury and returned home Tuesday after spending 19 days in the hospital. Attempted murder: Garcia-Juaregui also shot at Deputy Greg Sherwood (pictured with wife Gina above), and critically injured the officer . Recovery: Sherwood spent 19 days in hospital but was finally allowed to go home on Tuesday . After hitting Sherwood, the couple hit another roadblock when their truck crashed after hitting spikes laid on the road near Nephi, Utah. Instead of surrendering to police, Grunwald helped flagged down a minivan and her boyfriend carjacked the vehicle from a woman who was on her way home from a parent-teacher conference. This is just one of the instances prosecutors are using to argue that Grunwald was not being forced by her boyfriend to take part in the crime spree. After abandoning the truck, prosecutors say Grunwald 'on her own accord, follows Mr Garcia-Juaregui after leaving the vehicle without appearing to be coerced by him'. The couple didn't get far with the hijacked car and crashed again on a second strip of spikes. After hitting the spikes, police say Grunwald crossed into traffic and tried to strike another vehicle on purpose. End of the road: The hours-long chase finally came to an end when the couple's hijacked car hit a second set of spikes and they crashed . Juab County sheriff's deputies were finally able to stop the couple when they shot Garcia-Juaregui in the head. Justice: Grunwald has her first hearing scheduled for next Monday. She is being held on $1million . While he was lying on the ground, Grunwald yelled at officers: 'You f****** shot him' The officers kept the couple separated as they arrested Grunwald and prepared her boyfriend to be taken to the hospital, which displeased a dying Garcia-Juaregui. 'You not going to let me kiss my girl with my last dying breath,' he asked. He died the following day at the hospital . Friends who knew the couple told investigators that Grunwald was carrying Garcia-Juaregui's child and the two planned to marry in August when she turned 18. On her Facebook page, Grunwald posted a . cover photo which reads:' I'm just a girl who is in love with the most . annoying, cutest, funniest, nicest, and completely perfect guy in the . world'. After their . marriage, the couple planned to move to Mexico. They had been living at . Grunwald's mother's home in Draper 'for several months'. Grunwald . had allegedly been buying meth for her boyfriend and tested positive . for the drug after her arrest. Prosecutors have not yet said whether . Garcia-Juaregui had meth in his system during the car chase but drug paraphernalia was found in the truck.

While the ice itself caused immediate harm, the problem was the affect it had on water levels, which rised dramitically. 'The thickness of the ice keeps the ice from moving out to the river, so it’s caused the moving river to flow outside of its banks,' said Lakewood Fire Chief Scott Gilman. The ice pushed water levels to break through the banks and flood some park areas . The Rocky River Fire Department were monitoring the situation. 'Absolutely, we have our rescue boats and exposure suits so we can work out in the cold water if need be and boats can access folks who end up with a high water problem,' said Rocky River Fire Chief Christopher Flynn.

A Michigan mother charged with murdering and dismembering her son was captured on CCTV buying a circular saw. The saw Donna Scrivo, 60, bought was found in one of the bags containing the remains of Ramsay Scrivo, 32, which were found strewn across rural parts of St Clair County. Scrivo was charged Monday with the murder of her son after previously being charged with mutilating and illegally removing a body. Family despair: Donna Scrivo (left) has been charged with murdering and mutilating her son Ramsay Scrivo (right) Serious charges: Following two previous charges, Donna Scrivo had now been charged with premeditated murder . According to the Detroit Free Press, Assistant . Prosecutor William Cataldo said that Ramsay Scrivo was 'horrifically . mutilated' with ligature marks on his neck and blunt-force trauma to his . head and shoulders. An autopsy showed he died of asphyxiation. Gruesome purpose: Scrivo was captured on camera buying a circular saw that detectives believe she used to carve up her son . Cataldo said at a bond hearing earlier this month that Ramsay Scrivo's body had likely been placed in a bathtub and set on fire after it was mutilated. Donna Scrivo was arraigned in the 40th District Court. No follow-up court date has been set. She will undergo psychological evaluation to determine her competency to stand trial. The remains of Ramsay Scrivo were discovered around 3pm on January 30 after a resident in China Township reported seeing bags on the side of the road. Donna Scrivo had reported her son missing three days earlier on January 27. At the time, she told police that her son had left home the previous day and never came back. Authorities eventually found bags containing Ramsay Scrivo's body dropped in four locations around China and St Clair Townships - about 50 miles northeast of Detroit. Dumped: Ramsay's remains were found in black bags dropped off in four locations around China and St Clair townships in Michigan . Some of his remains were not in bags, and one bag contained clothes and charred paperwork. Police are still searching for one more limb. Surveillance footage shows that Donna Scrivo was in the area around the time the bags were reported. Another witness reported seeing the woman carrying black plastic bags out of the condo in St Clair Shores she shared with her son. Shocking: Neighbors were horrified to hear that Donna was charged for mutilating her son's body . Donna had been staying with her son ever since her home suffered fire damage in the fall and was being repaired. A police search of the condo and Donna's SUV turned up blood stains belonging to Ramsay. There was also sign of bleach being used in the condo. Police said they had contact with the mother and the son in the past over family trouble. But news of Ramsay's death, and interest in Donna as the perpetrator, came as a shock to Doris Odren - Donna's next door neighbor of 18 years. 'I knew that she loved Ramsey a lot; she really did. She doted on him, you know, like all mothers do with their sons,' Mrs Odren told CBS Detroit. 'I just … can’t get my head around that. I can’t see her … I know her.' Her husband Thomas Odren was just as surprised. 'It just seems so out of character,' Mr Odren told the Lansing State Journal. 'That’s what makes this so hard to process. She had such a good . relationship with Ramsay. I would never expect anyone to (dismember . their child).' 'We’re anxious to figure out what happened.' Donna . was officially arrested on January 31. Ramsay's cause of death has not . yet been released, as the medical examiner awaits a toxicology report. Ramsay . Scrivo graduated from De La Salle Collegiate High School in 1999 and . went on to earn his accounting degree from Wayne State University. He worked as an accountant for some time after graduation but quit when a surpervisor criticized his work. Most recently, he was working as an All State Insurance agent in Roseville. Guardian: Ramsay Scrivo (far right) had been under his mother's protection since last May, following his father's death . Since May, Donna Scrivo had been her son's guardian when he became despondent following his father Daniel's terminal illness. On May 16, the day after his father died, Donna petitioned the court to hospitalize her son, and Ramsay consented. Court documents obtained by the Detroit Free Press reveal that Ramsay's anger 'had escalated to unsafe levels' and that he 'threatened to commit suicide'. He . was also on probation for assault and his mother said he had been . getting into a lot of fights lately because of 'poor judgement'. She . said he suffered from paranoia and depression and had been refusing to . take his medications because he felt he didn't need it. Ramsay had even threatened a family friend he believed poisoned him. Looking: Donna Scrivo scanned the court room, but it didn't appear as though any family members turned up to support her . The court agreed that Ramsay was a danger to himself and placed him in his mother's care in May. The . following month, Ramsay told the court he planned to petition to end . the guardianship in six months and would cooperate with treatment, take . his medication and follow his mother's rules. But that changed in September when he had a tooth crown removed because he thought someone had planted it there as a speaker. Following that incident, Doctors diagnosed him with psychosis and said he was paranoid. In . court on Monday, Donna scanned the room as if she was looking for . someone - though none of her family seemed to have attended. She is currently being held on $100,000 bond and is due back in court on February 11.","Donna Scrivo, 60, has been charged with murder .

"Worthington allegedly asked police if they were familiar with 'that movie Avatar?' after his arrest . Aussie actor slapped with a desk ticket and released . By . Jade Watkins .

The photographer accused of kicking Lara Bingle during a scuffle outside a New York bar on Sunday claims that the model attacked him first. Paparazzo Sheng Li's defence lawyer Ron Kuby says the 26-year-old lashed out at his client when he tried to take her picture, according to news.com.au. Speaking in Manhattan Criminal Court on Monday during Li's arraignment, Kuby said that Worthington then approached his client and punched him in the face four times. 'She attacked me': The photographer accused of 'kicking' Lara Bingle says model sparked scuffle and reveals that her partner Sam Worthington punched him in the face four times . 'Ms. Bingle was the one that attacked him,' Kuby said. 'She claims that Mr. Li was following her for four hours and then runs up and kicks her in the shins. In what world does that make any sense?' 'He was on the job taking pictures and Ms. Bingle got upset and ran half way up the block and attacked him. 'Her large famous boyfriend ran up and punched him four times in the face and Worthington doesn’t even get charged.' Relocation: Sam and Lara are currently staying in New York for what is thought to be a long period of time . Meanwhile, court papers state that Li allegedly tried to purposely trip the model up in an effort to get her picture. 'The defendant followed her on a public street for approximately four hours, kept getting in her way as she was walking down the street and was trying to trip her, which caused her to fear for her safety,' they state. The incident, which saw both Worthington and Li arrested, occurred outside the Cubbyhole bar in the West Village. Serious: The couple have been dating since last year but there have been rumours that they married in secret earlier this year . Speaking out: Lara posted this quote from Amy Poehler on her Instagram page on Tuesday . During the scuffle, Sam was said to have referred to Bingle as his 'wife', yelling at the photographer, 'you kicked my wife.' However, a friend of Lara's told the MailOnline on Monday: ‘He would have been speaking figuratively. They are definitely not married, as far as I know.’ Several reports earlier this year suggested that the couple had secretly married in Western Australia ahead of a romantic trip to the Maldives. Protective: The photographer claims that Worthington punched him four times in the face . They have since been seen wearing matching rings on their wedding fingers. Before Worthington was taken away in a police car following his arrest on Sunday it is said that the actor asked officers if they knew 'that movie Avatar?' New York Police Department Lieutenant John Grimpel confirmed Worthington's arrest on Sunday, New York time. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'It happened at 5.30pm this evening. 'The photographer kicked Lara and then Worthington punched him causing the photographer to have lacerations to his nose. So in love: Sam and Lara have been virtually inseparable since they began dating last year . 'He has been charged with assault. He punched the photographer.' Worthington was later issued a desk ticket and released, while Li was charged with assault, reckless endangerment and harassment. MailOnline have contacted both Bingle's and Worthington's spokespeople for a comment. This is Worthington’s second run-in with a photographer - he was arrested and pepper sprayed in Atlanta in 2012, following an argument outside of a restaurant. Several people who witnessed the attack on Sunday (New York time) took to Twitter to describe the scene. 'Pretty sure I just saw Sam Worthington getting arrested in Greenwich Village. Definitely in a cop car. Ok. #nyc #samworthington @OmiScott,' wrote @MiriamEliseMP. Sharing the love: Lara posted this snap of the pair together on Valentine's Day . 'Just saw Sam worthington and Sara (sic) bingle get in physical fight with paparazzi outside cubby hole... Cops just got here,' tweeted @harrisonjobe. Meanwhile, @eemmmmaa wrote: 'Just saw Sam Worthington get arrested. Hashtag New York moment.' The Cubbyhole, is a popular gay bar located in the West Village of Manhattan. Worthington and his Australian model girlfriend have been in New York since the beginning of Fashion Week where they attended a number of shows together. They were photographed strolling hand-in-hand through the city on Friday looking very much in love with the pretty blonde smiling widely as she paused to gaze into her Avatar beau’s eyes. Lara last week told social media followers that she hopes to relocate to the Big Apple permanently saying she was in NYC and 'here to stay!' Don't you know who I am? Following his arrest, Sam was said to have asked police officers if they knew 'that movie Avatar?' A spokesperson later confirmed to MailOnline that she is looking to spend more time there. Last month the Cotton On Body designer told Woman's Day magazine that she wasn't happy living in Australia because she and Worthington 'don't get any peace'. 'Sydney's my home but I don't like it,' she said. 'I can't even go to the supermarket without getting papped (snapped by paparazzi).

Seth Meyers kicked things off with his . new job as host of Late Night on Monday with the help of Vice President Joe Biden, who skillfully laughed off questions about his designs on the White House. Myers asked Biden about his 2016 intentions while comedian Amy Poehler stood gamely by to help break in the stage with her fellow Saturday Night Live alum. 'Well you know I was planning on making a major announcement tonight,' said the vice president in reply, 'but I decided tonight is your night.' Scroll Down for Video . 'Well you know I was planning on making a major announcement tonight,' the vice president joked to newly minted Late Night host Seth Meyers. 'But I decided tonight is your night.' As he explained to Meyers, ‘So I hope you'll . invite me back.’ Meyers . takes over for new Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon and managed to get . through the opening-night butterflies with practiced ease and charm. His debut was the final piece in a late night shakeup at NBC in the wake of host Jay Leno's retirement. When Biden arrived to join first guest Poehler, it made for a cozy trio. After all, Biden and Poehler have a history of their own, reaching back to his cameo appearance last season on her NBC sitcom ‘Parks and Recreation.’ ‘Amy really helped me with the Secret Service,’ said Biden, who reported that when he had finished shooting his ‘Parks and Recreation’ scene and was making his departure, the smitten Poehler grabbed a Secret Service agent by the lapels and demanded, ‘You take care of him!’ Poehler joked that she and Biden now . plan to make a film together called ‘Snakes on a Train.’ Then she . declared that she was running for president in two years. The . premiere of ‘Late Night with Seth Myers’ (which taped Monday evening . for airing at 12:35 a.m. EST/11:35 p.m. CST), represented the final step . in NBC's talk-show turnover. Meyers, . who until early this month was an ‘SNL’ veteran and co-anchor of its . ‘Weekend Update’ newscast, is filling the vacancy left by Jimmy Fallon . after five years as ‘Late Night’ host. Big night: Biden's faux announcement came on Meyers' first ever episode of Late Night, which was taped Monday and scheduled to air after the Tonight Show with its new host Jimmy Fallon . Fallon, of course, moved up last week to be host of ‘The Tonight Show,’ replacing Jay Leno. So far, the late-night changes are paying off. Riding the crest of NBC's Olympics coverage, ‘The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon’ was seen by an average of 8.5 million viewers in its first week, the biggest ‘Tonight’ audience in decades. Can the 40-year-old Meyers make the most of this popular lead-in? He comes to his new role as a talk-show host with demonstrated skill and appeal from his years as an ‘SNL’ writer and performer. He is known as a TV star who doesn't hog the spotlight and enjoys playing the straight man. He is also known as cerebral, which, if not moderated, could work against him: One of his monologue jokes hinged on the viewer knowing who Doris Kearns Goodwin is. It wasn't very funny either. And flopped. Other jokes were more successful, even if they were larded by Meyers' insistent pause-and-grin pacing. Shift change: Meyers was tapped as part of the shift change on NBC late night talk shows. With Jay Leno leaving the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon took his palce, thus leaving the Late Night desk open for the Saturday Night Live alum . He announced that the brassiere turns 100 years old this week — ‘and so does everyone who still calls it a brassiere.’ He noted that the Arizona Legislature passed a bill that would allow business owners asserting their religious beliefs to deny service to gay customers: ‘Some businesses have already put up signs that read, 'Nice shirt, nice shoes, no service.'‘ . Later, he took another swing at Arizona during what may emerge as a durable humor franchise: Venn diagrams displaying what two seemingly different things have in common. One example: The intersection of Russia and the NBA was revealed to be ‘Places That are More Gay-Friendly than Arizona.’ The setting for Meyers' ‘Late Night’ is a sleek, art deco design. Sliding screens substitute for curtains. As with most other talk shows, Meyers' format provides for a musical guest. On his first night, it was the band A Great Big World. Speaking of music, a valuable asset is the leader of Meyers' house band, Fred Armisen, himself a musician as well as a comedian-performer — and clearly a funny sidekick. During a brief exchange, Meyers, playing the able straight man, questioned Armisen on one of his many projects, a new series on the History channel. ‘It's called 'Recent History,'‘ said Armisen, deadpan. ‘It only goes back the past hour or so, but it has an historical spin. Very serious. Very dry.’ One other feature that seems to have potential: Meyers' skill at relating a story. From his desk, he told a charming anecdote about an outing with his wife that went awry. With apparent effortlessness, he brought the tale to a finish by observing, ‘It's hard to feel macho when you're holding a tiny dog and another man is changing your wife's tire.’ Oddball: Friend and fellow Saturday Night Live castmember Fred Armisen leads Meyers' studio band with his characteristic strangeness and aplomb .","Meyers took over Jimmy Fallon's old spot starting with the first episode taped Monday afternoon .

The gap between the wealthy and the poor is most extreme in several of the United States' most prosperous and largest cities. The economic divides in Atlanta, San Francisco, Washington, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles are significantly greater than the national average, according to a study released last week by the Brookings Institution, the Washington-based think tank. It suggests that many sources of both economic growth and income inequality have co-existed near each other for the past 35 years. These cities may struggle in the future to provide adequate public schooling, basic municipal services because of a narrow tax base and 'may fail to produce housing and neighborhoods accessible to middle-class workers and families,' the study said. This Brookings Institute maps shows the economic inequality in large cities, with dark green circles (like Atlanta and San Francisco) representing more wealthy disparity . Explained: In Atlanta, the average income for the top 5percent of residents is nearly 20 times of that of the income for the bottom 20 percent of residents. 'There's something of a relationship between economic success and inequality,' said Alan Berube, a senior fellow at Brookings. 'These cities are home to some of the highest paying industries and jobs in the country.' At the same time, Berube noted, many of these cities may inadvertently widen the gap between rich and poor because they have public housing and basic services that make them attractive to low-wage workers. The findings come at a delicate moment for the country, still slogging through a weak recovery from the Great Recession. Much of the nation's job growth has been concentrated in lower-wage careers. Few Americans have enjoyed pay raises. President Barack Obama is pushing for a higher minimum wage. Protesters in San Francisco have tried to block a private bus that shuttles Google employees from gentrifying neighborhoods to their offices in Silicon Valley. Many wealthy Americans, from venture capitalist Tom Perkins to real estate billionaire Sam Zell, argue that the nation has tipped toward class warfare. Incomes for the top 5 percent of earners in Atlanta averaged $279,827 in 2012. That's almost 19 times more than what the bottom 20 percent of that city's population earned. Unequal and rising: The gap between rich and poor has also grown the most in San Francisco, Atlanta and Miami since the Great Recession as poor families get even poorer. Meanwhile, the gap has actually shrunk in Seattle and Denver . This ratio is more than double the nationwide average for this measure of income inequality. The top 5 percent of earners across the country have incomes 9.1 times greater than the bottom quintile. Major chasms also appeared in the tech hub of San Francisco, the financial center of New York, the seat of the federal government in Washington and the home of the entertainment industry in Los Angeles. 'In San Francisco, skyrocketing housing costs may increasingly preclude low-income residents from living in the city altogether,' the study said. San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee said in an editorial published last week that 'working families cannot support themselves on the (city's) current minimum wage of $10.74 per hour' - already $3.49 above the federal minimum and 64 cents more than Obama's proposed increase. Lee has also announced plans to build and restore 10,000 homes for low and moderate-income families by 2020. Not all tech hubs have witnessed rising inequality. Winning issue: Bill de Blasio was catapulted into New York City Hall in part with his 'tale of two cities' campaigning over the city's wealth gap . Seattle, where Amazon and Microsoft are based, saw its income disparity decline since 2007. So did Denver. Austin, Texas, experienced a mild uptick. 'Both the tech boom and energy boom are inequality-reducing,' said Michael Mandel, chief economic strategist at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington. 'Tech introduces a path to good jobs.' The Brookings study also found that inequality increased across cities even though incomes often fell for wealthy households between the start of the recession in 2007 and 2012. During that five-year period, average incomes for the top 5 percent in Jacksonville, Florida, tumbled $18,999 to $152,329. But the bottom 20 percent living in Jacksonville lost a greater share of their incomes over that period, so the level of inequality increased. Significant gaps also exist in Miami and Baltimore. But that's largely because their poorest residents there earn so little. The lowest quintile of Miami residents earned just $10,348 in 2012, about half the national average for that group. Of the nation's 50 biggest cities, just 18 experienced greater income inequality since the recession that was statistically significant. That was due primarily to falling incomes for the poorest residents. This occurred in places that suffered from the burst of the housing bubble - such as Tucson, Arizona, and Albuquerque, New Mexico - and Midwestern cities still reeling from the collapse of manufacturing such as Cleveland, Ohio; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Not all the 50 largest cities are bastions of inequality. Some Western and Sun Belt cities with smaller downtowns had a noticeably smaller divide than the national average. These cities such as Mesa, Arizona, and Arlington, Texas, are essentially 'overgrown suburbs,' the study said. They tend to attract neither the highest-paying jobs nor the extreme poverty of the older cities.","In Atlanta, Georgia, average income for the top 5percent of wealthiest residents ($280,000) in nearly 20 times that of the bottom 20percent (less than $15,000)
New York ranks sixth in income disparity with the wealthiest residents making 13 times as much as the bottom 20percent .

Billy Connolly discovered he had Parkinson's disease after a chance encounter with an Australian fan who spotted him walking strangely, the comedian has revealed. The 71-year-old Scottish star told how a Tasmanian doctor diagnosed him on the spot after seeing him walking through a hotel lobby. The man approached the comedian and told him to see his doctor right away as his gait suggested he was showing early signs of the illness. Health issues: Billy Connolly was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and prostate cancer but has survived the cancer (pictured in January in New York) Last September, Connolly announced that he had had surgery for prostate cancer and was being treated for early symptoms of Parkinson's, a degenerative brain disorder. Speaking in detail for the first time about his health battles, Connolly insisted he never considered dying. He told how he was staying at a hotel in Los Angeles preparing to appear on Conan O'Brien's chat show when he met the concerned fan. In a US radio interview, he said: 'It was the strangest thing of all. 'I was doing Conan O'Brien's thing and they put me up in the Sportsmen's Lodge in Los Angeles. 'I was walking through the lobby and every time I had gone through there was a crowd of boys and girls and a couple of adults. 'It turned out they were dancers from Australia. 'The guy who was in charge of them came over to me one day and said 'Billy, I'm a big fan, I'm from Tasmania'. 'He said, 'I'm a surgeon and I have been watching you walking, you have a strange gait'. That was the way he put it. Enjoying life: Billy seen watching a football match between Celtric and Hearts in Glasgow with Rod Stewart in 2010 . 'He said 'You're showing distinct signs of early onset Parkinson's disease, see your doctor'. 'I think it was the way I held myself when I was walking. 'Then they did blood tests and various other little bits and pieces and told me I had it.' Connolly also told how his prostate cancer was diagnosed during a routine examination. He had surgery in America and was given the all-clear in December 2013. He said: 'It was found by the routine finger up the bum test. 'When I was told by the doctor I had cancer I said to him, 'I've never been told that before'. Usually you are only told once. 'The doctor in the hospital, the one who operated on me, said to me 'the good news is you're not going to die'. 'I said that it never crossed my mind that I might. It's that arrogance thing, I think I'm going to live forever.' The Glaswegian comic said he was taking a relaxed approach to his illness and joked that he had always suffered from memory loss, a symptom of Parkinson's, during stand-up routines. He added: 'I prefer not to give it any notice. I don't see much shaking going on and I have always had a sh**** memory anyway. 'I have forgotten things my entire career. I was taking drugs to control the Parkinson's but I'm not on them anymore. 'The doctor said the side effects were stronger than the effects. I never noticed any side effects but he told me they could include a deep interest in sex and gambling. 'In terms of treatment I think some of the stem cell stuff is very promising but they have a lot of problems legally getting it through.' Connolly is due to return to the stage next month when he plays five gigs in America before undertaking a tour of New Zealand in April and May. He has vowed to continue performing and said he has no plans to retire. Last week, Connolly insisted he didn't want to get involved in the Scottish independence debate and said he would not vote as he would be in New Zealand when the vote is held.","The Australian doctor, who was a fan, told Billy his gait suggested he was showing early signs of the illness .

At first, these images look like a 21st century ink-blot test, designed to test the viewer's unconscious mind with random patterns and shapes. They were even created by an American psychologist Mark Scalco, 49, but these kaleidoscopic pictures are nothing to do with his work and are just for fun. Mr Scalco, who refers to his work as 'smokreations', created the pictures using incense smoke, an ordinary camera and some Photoshop skills. Mark Scalco layered an image of incense smoke before using a mirrored effect on editing software to create the snowflake-like pattern . Mr Scalco lets the random smoke shapes dictate the final picture. It wasn't until he turned this image upside down that he noticed the grasshopper, then used different colours to pick it out . Mr Scalco says his psychedelic images have been well-received online and at art shows he has participated in . 'I've always enjoyed the patterns made by kaleidoscopes or some geometric screen-savers,' says Mr Scalco, of Durham, North Carolina. 'I remember as a kid looking for shapes in clouds and smoke. Sometimes they clearly resemble specific things like a face or animal, while some are less clear, people see different things in all of my work. 'It's a stress reliever for me since it is so completely different from my job.' Working with a normal digital SLR camera and a black or white background, Mark uses incense smoke to produce his creations. Mr Scalco says he makes the images as a stress-relief activity after a hard day at work . He took up photography by capturing images of buildings and nature, but switched to smoke photographs after reading about some of the effects that could be achieved in a book . Mr Scalco says that as a child he used to imagine shapes in clouds and smoke, and that adults see something different in his pictures . The images are then finalised using software, such as Photoshop, where he can use mirror effects and introduce striking colours to add the final touches to the mesmerizing patterns. Mark explains: 'In the case of the green insect-like photograph, the smoke was duplicated and layered on itself and the whole thing was flipped upside down. 'Then the grasshopper creature was seen, I added the colour in Photoshop to make it fit with the insect-like creature I saw. 'The frosted smoke flake was more complicated, the smoke photo was layered multiple times, the photo was tinted in Photoshop, and the edges were added with a Photoshop plug-in for the final result.' Mark's artistic experiments with smoke followed his existing interest in photography. Mr Scalco says he was also mesmerised by patterns in kaleidoscopes and geometric screen-savers . Using editing tools allows Mr Scalco to create impossible patterns from the smoke, such as this disc which has a plume passing through its centre . He said: 'I started shooting waterfalls, nature, and architecture a number of years ago. 'I really became interested in smoke photography however from a book I read, and began playing with the artistic possibilities when you add certain effects to the images. 'Ultimately, the random shapes that occur in the smoke usually are what lead me toward a particular design. This image, created from two identical plumes of smoke, looks a little like milk mixing into coffee . Mr Scalco usually takes his pictures against a black or white background, but has opted for a blue one here, making the purple pattern really stand out . 'I have had very positive reactions from the photography websites that I am a member of, and art shows that I have participated in. 'I have also inspired others to try smoke photo art, which is of course really great.'","Mark Scalco, a psychologist, creates the images in his spare time .

Philip, 92, no stranger to the odd swear word after a career in the Royal Navy, laughed and then continued to chuckle away to himself as the player finally looked up, realised who he was speaking to and walked off looking slightly sheepish.

When Sophia Hoffman, 11, and Kush Sharma, 13, buzzed through the list of words over 47 rounds during Saturday's Jackson County Spelling Bee, organizers had to pull more from a dictionary. But after blitzing the extra 20 words, organizers decided to postpone the competition until March 8 because people were too tired to continue.

Onlookers were stunned when the students effortlessly ran through a list of about 20 additional words bee officials picked out of their Merriam-Webster's 11th Edition during the lunch break, The Kansas City Star reported. But bee officials decided not to pull more words from the dictionary because they worried one speller might get a tough word and the other a relatively easy one, which wouldn't be fair. Plus, Thompson said, at 'about 2 o'clock, I think we were all really tired.' Saturday's competition went 66 rounds, she said, while last year's bee ended after only 21. Venue: The Jackson County Spelling Bee kicked off 9am Saturday at the Kansas City Public Library's Plaza Branch (pictured) 'Scherzo', 'fantoccini' and 'intaglio' were among the words Kush correctly spelled in the late rounds, while Sophia nailed words such as 'schadenfreude', 'mahout' and 'barukhzy'. Both of them missed what Kush said was the hardest word: a 'French word; I have no idea how to pronounce it. It was a long word.' With the winner moving on to the national spelling bee in Washington, D.C., in May, both contestants were at the top of their game in the final rounds Saturday, Thompson said . 'Sophia and Kush's eyes were just bright and glowing,' she said. 'It was almost magical.' The contest will resume March 8 at an undetermined library site.

Troubled Arsenal star Mesut Ozil was quizzed by police over allegations the car he was driving was in a collision with a photographer. The £42.5million record signing was back at home in Germany on Monday night after being given a two-day break to get away from problems on and off the pitch – he was rested from Saturday's team following the Champions League defeat against Bayern Munich. Claim: Mesut Ozil was quizzed by police after he was involved in a collision with a photographer on Friday . In the stands: Ozil was omitted from Arsenal's matchday squad for their win over Sunderland on Saturday . In the driving seat: Ozil was said to have been involved in a collision with a photographer on Friday night . Ozil was not even named among the subs . by boss Arsene Wenger for the 4-0 win over Sunderland, the day after the . alleged incident which happened in Highgate, North London. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Police . were called at approximately 7.18pm on Friday 21 February to reports of . an alleged collision between a vehicle and a member of the public. 'The member of the public, a man in his 30s, sustained minor injuries. Officers have spoken to the driver of the vehicle.' The spokesman said inquiries were continuing and no arrests have been made. Ozil has been criticised for his recent dip in form, which was highlighted as he missed a penalty in the Gunners' 2-0 Champions League defeat to Bayern Munich. But Bayern star Thomas Muller believes his Germany team-mate is simply suffering from not having a winter break, something he enjoyed during his spells at Real Madrid and Werder Bremen. Impact: Ozil has scored five goals for Arsenal since arriving from Real Madrid for just over £42million . Muller said: 'It’s not easy for Mesut but I know how good he can be and I hope he has many good games for Arsenal.' Ozil has scored four goals for Arsenal in the Premier League and made eight assists in 21 days, but hasn't scored since early December and has been on disappointing form. The 25-year-old has gone back to Germany in an attempt to breathe fresh life into his Arsenal career, given the time off by Wenger. He has jetted back to his homeland for a few days of rest and relaxation. Ozil and Wenger, who hopes to have injured Aaron Ramsey back for the clash against Tottenham on March 16, remain determined to make a success of the playmaker's move to London and hope the short trip back to Germany can help rejuvenate the 25-year-old. The man: Most fans are sticking by Ozil and calling his form a blip, but others want a drastic improvement .

A heartbroken couple are preparing to say their final goodbyes to their dying five-year-old son - three years after losing their daughter. Kiran Nusrat and Irfan Akhtar, from Coventry, are living a nightmare that most parents couldn’t begin to imagine - knowing that shortly they will lose a second child to a cruel degenerative condition. Abdullah is dying of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, the same condition that killed his sister, Adeeba, in 2010 when she was just three. Kiran Nusrat and Irfan Akhtar had two children both with devastating mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. Their daughter, Adeeba, died in 2010 at the age of three and their son, Abdullah, five, is also dying . Ms Nusrat, 27, said: ‘I will never see them grow up like other parents see their children grow older and that really hurts.’ But she added: ‘I may not have had them for long but they are a blessing.’ Abdullah began to be gradually robbed of the ability to move before he could even crawl or say his first words. He is unable to move anything other than his eyes and is currently being given palliative care at home. His parents know that they will probably eventually have to make the traumatic decision to turn off his life support machine – just as they did with his sister. Ms Nusrat said: ‘It’s hard seeing other parents with their children, going shopping and seeing children hold their mum’s hand and say “mummy”. Adeeba appeared to be a healthy baby when she was first born but by the time she was six months old her parents had started to notice that she was becoming weak . Abdullah's parents are caring for him at home but they know he will probably have to go into a hospice . ‘I’ve been a mum to two children and yet never heard them say “mum”. ‘I will never see them grow up like other parents see their children grow older and that hurts. It really hurts.’ The syndrome is an inherited disease which starts to show symptoms in infancy. Most patients are born after a normal pregnancy and appear healthy at birth. Symptoms usually begin to appear in the first few months of life. It causes progressive muscle weakness, decreased muscle tone and kidney problems. It also causes patients to lose motor skills such as standing, walking, eating and talking. Eventually the muscles that control breathing become weak and respiratory failure is the most common cause of death. Intelligence is not usually affected. Children with severe forms of the condition usually survive for less than a year. It is not yet fully understood what causes the condition but both parents of the child have to carry the gene mutation. It is recessive meaning a child has a 25 per cent chance of suffering from the disease if both their parents carry the mutation. There were no signs of problems when . Adeeba was born in 2006, but when she was six months old her parents . noticed she was getting weaker. Their world came crashing down when she was rushed to hospital gasping for breath one night having suddenly deteriorated. Adeeba struggled to get enough oxygen and she was taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary where she was ventilated. She had a tracheotomy, and spent 10 months on the high dependency ward where she was finally diagnosed with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. The condition results in neurological symptoms that start to appear in infancy and is characterised by generalised muscle weakness. As the disorder worsens, the muscles which control breathing are weakened and ventilator support is needed. Ms Nusrat soon discovered she was pregnant with their second child and Adeeba was in intensive care by the time her little brother was born. The couple prayed Abdullah would escape the rare genetic disorder - and were told there was a 75 per cent chance he would. But their world was shattered for a second time when he too suffered developmental delays and was finally diagnosed with the same condition at seven months old. ‘We weren’t only unlucky once, but twice,’ Ms Nusrat said. Ms Nusrat, 27, said: 'I will never see them grow up like other parents see their children grow older and that really hurts' Just after his first birthday, Abdullah was also admitted to Leicester Royal Infirmary and he and his sister were in cubicles next to each other some of the time. But after a bad bout of the respiratory infection bronchiolitis, Adeeba was taken to Rainbows Hospice for Children and Young People in Loughborough where she passed away in July 2010. Her parents found Rainbows to be a ‘magical’ place, nothing like what they expected it to be. They were so impressed by the care Adeeba received they vowed it would be where they switched off Abdullah’s life support machine when the time came. The couple are raising money for the children’s hospice where Abdullah will probably spend his last hours.","Kiran Nusrat and Irfan Akhtar had two children with devestating mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome - Adeeba and Abdullah .

Jose Mourinho has blasted a French media recording of a private conversation in which he appeared to criticise his strikers  a 'disgrace' as he defended his relationship with Samuel Eto'o. Mourinho, whose comments were broadcast on French TV, said he was joking when he complained about Chelsea's lack of strikers and made an unflattering comment about the age of Eto'o. The Chelsea manager insists he was joking and fumed at the ethics of the journalists who recorded his comments. Job to do: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho speaks with his coaches during training . Ready for battle: Mourinho will lead Chelsea out in the Champions League tie with Galatasaray . Speaking at a press conference ahead of Wednesday's Champions League last-16 clash against Galatasaray, he said: 'There is no story. It . was a funny conversation with me and someone not from the football . world. It is a disgrace that someone is taping it when we don’t know. 'I think you . should be embarrassed, as a media professional because from my point of view I . don't think you - not you [here in this room], but a colleague - (should be) able to record a . private conversation and to make it public.' Mourinho also said Eto'o has no . reason to be upset about the leaked comments. He . joked that Eto’o was probably older than 32 and hinted that an ideal . solution may be to sign Radamel Falcao because the Colombian deserved a . bigger audience than he had at Monaco. 'I need a striker, Falcao needs a club,' Mourinho is secretly recorded as saying. 'A player like him cannot play . in front of 3,000 people. Monaco is a club to end (your career with).' Mourinho . was caught in conversation with the boss of Swiss watch-makers Hublot, . explaining that Chelsea did not have anyone to score goals. The conversation was recorded by French broadcasters Canal+ in . Switzerland on February 17 and appeared as a video clip on their . website. It has since been removed but Mourinho’s words had already been . well circulated, much to the Chelsea manager's embarrassment. The incident has . darkened his mood on the eve of a reunion with Didier Drogba, the . Galatasaray striker and Chelsea legend of the first Mourinho era. Drogba . left Stamford Bridge in 2012 and the club have yet to replace his . immense presence. Nothing to worry about: Mourinho says Samuel Eto'o should not be concerned about the leaked comments . Lack of goals: Mourinho was overheard saying his strikers - Eto'o, Fernando Torres and Demba Ba - couldn't score . Mourinho said he enjoyed his most successful season with the striker when the pair won an unprecedented treble of Champions League, Serie A and Coppa Italia titles with Inter Milan in 2010, and the Portuguese insisted there was no issue between the pair. He said: 'Samuel Eto’o is Samuel Eto’o, he is four times a . Champions League winner, people think three but it is four. Once with . Real Madrid, twice with Barcelona and once with Inter. 'It is with . him I had the best season of my career. He is one of few players to . work with me at a second club. He has no reason to be upset. 'Also he told a few years ago that, ""Mourinho is the only manager in the world I would never play for"". After a few years he was playing with me at Inter and now he is playing for me. 'There is no story.' Threat: Didier Drogba will pose problems for former club Chelsea when he lines up for Galatasaray . Friends reunited: Mourinho says it will be strange going up against Drogba - but he has to forget about it . On his reunion with former Chelsea striker Drogba, Mourinho says he will try to put his feelings for the striker to one side during the game. He added: 'I look forward to every match. I like to play. I’m happy to do it. I like to do it against the best and Galatasaray is the Turkish champions. 'Drogba, I know is difficult and it’s a strange feeling. I have to admit that. We have to do our job. I know he wants to do his job. It’s a strange feeling we have to try to forget during the game.

'Even during the game sometimes you look at players who belong to my life like Didier and (Wesley) Sneijder, and I have to play against them and it’s not the same. 'I played Chelsea once and the feeling not the same but you have to do your job. You want to win. That’s the basic principle of football.

Zara Phillips has become the first senior member of the Royal Family to sell photographs of their new baby to a celebrity magazine – for a reported fee of £150,000. The Queen’s grand-daughter, her husband Mike Tindall and their five-week-old daughter Mia Grace are today plastered over 13 pages of Hello! magazine, as well as its front cover. The Mail understands senior officials at Buckingham Palace were not made aware of the lucrative deal in advance and, tellingly, a spokesman for the Queen refused to comment publicly yesterday. Zara and Mike appear in this week's Hello! magazine with a placid looking baby Mia lying between them . Quiet time: Phillips and Tindall, seen here leaving the Christmas Day service at Sandringham less than a month before she gave birth, have kept a low profile since the birth .

The accompanying . interview sees Zara and Mike speak about Mia’s birth on January 17 and . even reveal how Zara called her grandmother as soon as she returned home . from hospital. New mum: Phillips and baby Mia were spotted enjoying the sunshine at the Barbury racecourse last week . Asked . whether Palace protocol obliged them to inform the Queen as soon as the . baby was born, Mike says: ‘I sent a text to all the family. Zara is very . close to her grandmother, so of course she made a phone call once we . got back home.’ Former . world champion three-day eventer Zara, 32, says Mia is ‘pretty relaxed . and happy so far’ while Mike, 35, describes becoming a father as . ‘awesome’. The couple also reveal they aimed to conceive in time for a . December or January birth as it will allow Zara to compete in August’s . World Championships. Former . England rugby captain Mike says: ‘I can see that Z [his nickname for . Zara] is itching to be out there again.’ Zara also says there is a . Shetland pony lined up for her daughter to learn to ride. Checking in: Phillips takes a peek at baby Mia at the racecourse in Wiltshire . Zara described her husband, here with her at Prince George's christening, as a 'hands-on' father, while he gushed: 'I still keeping looking at Mia and thinking ""Oh! We made that!""' Mia's second cousin Prince George was born at the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London . The . interview was brokered by SEL, an Australian firm dealing in . sponsorship and client management. Its small London office was set up in . 2012 by Peter. Like her . brother, Zara has no Royal title or taxpayer funding. She earns a living . as a professional equestrian, funding her stables through sponsorship . deals with firms including Land Rover and Rolex. Last night a source . close to Zara insisted she and Mike had agreed to the deal as . ‘international sporting figures’ rather than members of the Royal . Family. They said: ‘It [the . magazine deal] was not, initially, something they intended to do. The . pictures had already been taken by an old schoolfriend of Zara when they . were approached by Hello! and agreed to sign a deal. It was all very . sudden. ‘I think Zara . understands there will be a level of criticism directed at her but she . clearly felt this was the best way to approach the level of interest in . Mia and, of course, provide for her future.’ But . lawyer Niri Shan, head of intellectual property and media and . entertainment at Taylor Wessing, warned: ‘This is going to make it very . difficult for them to protect the privacy of their baby when she is photographed in the future, outside of any specific issue of harassment.’ This is not the first time Zara or her family have struck a deal with Hello!: .

Prisoners are normally punished for fighting – but one jail in Thailand does just the opposite. Klong Prem Central Prison offers inmates the chance to have their sentences reduced or even be released, by beating outsiders in fights. There's also prize money up for grabs. The concept is a twist on Jean-Claude Van Damme movie In Hell, where prisoners fight each other to entertain the warden. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Knuckling down to it: Prisoners in one Thai jail are given the chance to 'battle for freedom' The Thai prison's bouts take place at a tournament called ‘Prison Fight’, which features a ring with this title emblazoned across it. The bizarre sense of razzamatazz is heightened by the fighters’ clothes – they wear special ‘Prison Fight’ shorts - and the cheerleaders who sometimes parade around. The fights are watched by prison officials and huge numbers of inmates. Brutal: An outside fighter (left) takes on an inmate as the referee looks on .

'Prison fights are done to help the prisoners. It lets the prisoners fight so they can earn money,' said Mr. Pek, Prison Fights coordinator. ‘They also fight to reduce the time of their sentences. To reduce their sentence and to bring honour and fame to Thailand, if they can defeat foreign fighters and fight a lot. Some of the fighters are in for drugs, robbery or murder.

With her neat blonde hair and shoulder-grazing earrings, Flavia Froese doesn't look particularly intimidating but to Rio de Janero's crack dealers, that's exactly what she is. Brazil has the biggest crack problem in the world, with drugs worth 10 million dollars sold every single day and addicts on every corner in the country's slums and shanty towns. Worse, the crack epidemic has led to spiralling crime rates with murder rates on the increase as drug dons compete for their share of the lucrative trade. Battle: Lawyer Flavia Froese is fighting to persuade Rio's drug barons to stop selling crack cocaine . Dangerous: Flavia is a regular visitor to some of Rio's most dangerous favelas where she meets drug dons . Flavia, however, is one of a growing number of Brazilians with plans to to something about the crack epidemic and says the Government should start taking it more seriously. Currently, the Brazilian Government's solution to the crack problem is to 'pacify' the favelas - using the police and army to drive out the dealers and addicts - but so far, only in 30, all in tourist areas, out of 1000, has the policy been implemented. 'Crack here in Rio is treated like a . security risk rather than the public health issue it is,' she explains. 'Without a doubt . there is a policy of social cleansing. All they are doing is sweeping . dirt under the carpet. The Olympic legacy in Brazil will be an army of . zombie crack users.' Most of Rio's addicts are concentrated in the favelas and in these 'crack lands' can be seen openly smoking the drug on the street. But while the dealers are lining their pockets, for those addicted to the drug, the only thing crack produces is misery. Seedy: Brazilian police have 'pacified' 30 of Rio's 1,000 slums - all 30 are in tourist areas . Disgusting: Ross Kemp in front of one of the many piles of rubbish that Rio's crack addicts live and work in . 'I'm here looking for my son, he's a . crack user,' says one woman who was filmed entering the favela in her Sunday best for Ross Kemp's Extreme World series. 'I have been struggling with this for five years, all because . of this godforsaken crack. Lots of mothers go through this. 'It hurts . when I see them like this sleeping rough, covered in mud, dirty and . hungry, I won't give up, he's my son, I can't abandon him. 'I have roses . as a pledge, I put them in church for him, I love my son so much. I have . faith in my God, I will see my son transformed.' Addict: 'Sometimes I don't sleep at all,' says crack user Bobo, who doesn't use his name for safety reasons . Pacification: A crack addict, centre, reacts as a social worker tries to calm her during a raid in one favela . Flavia, meanwhile has focused her . efforts on persuading the drug barons, many of whom are clients . represented by her law firm, to give up selling crack. 'We . are here on a mission to give drug dealers a conscience, to get them to . stop selling crack,' she tells Kemp as they wander through one of the . unpacified favelas. 'The . motivation to change this problem has to come from their own experience . because a lot of these drug dealers have relatives who use crack so . it's very real for them. They see the destruction that crack causes in the . community. 'On the other hand there is of course the issue of profit which is why we haven't yet stopped the sale of crack.' And her fears appear to be borne out. Filmed meeting with one of the drug dons, she is told, in no uncertain terms, that if he doesn't sell crack, someone else will. No country for young boys: A young drug dealer sitting on a chair holds a weapon and a two-way radio . No help: An alleged crack addict, second from right, tries to bite a social worker as she is taken away . 'The problem is that we rely on this,' he adds. 'I earn . $10,000 a month but the average salary is $160. There's no comparison. He adds: 'You . have to explain that that as long as there's corruption, this won't . stop. Corruption in this country is shameless. They hide behind masks, . they hide behind everything. We line their pockets and they leave us to . sell.' Flavia herself hopes that the dealers will eventually give up selling crack - even if that means switching to selling other drugs instead. 'I'm not condoning drugs,' she adds. 'I think all drugs are bad.' But with six million Brazilian adults willing to admit they've tried the substance, it's clear that something needs to be done about Brazil's crack epidemic.

The longest pay squeeze in history will end next year, with many finally getting a pay rise that beats inflation, experts predicted yesterday. For five years, the average worker’s wage increases have been well below the rate of inflation, leaving them struggling with rising energy and food bills. But yesterday the Office for National Statistics said that inflation dropped to 2.1 per cent in November, the lowest rate for four years. While the cost of living might rise . again next month because of increases in energy bills, it is widely . expected to fall next year to, or even below, the Government’s target of . 2 per cent. Private . sector bosses predict they will typically hand out pay rises ‘in the . region of 2.5 per cent’ in 2014, according to a survey by analysts Xpert . HR. If . inflation – measured according to the consumer prices index – falls to 2 . per cent, this would mean workers finally getting a pay rise that is . higher than the rate at which the cost of living is rising. Samuel Tombs, of consultants Capital Economics, said: ‘An end to the squeeze on real earnings is finally in sight.’ Bank . of England governor Mark Carney said: ‘Inflation has fallen back to . within a hair’s breadth of the 2 per cent target and the recovery has . finally taken hold.’ But for public sector workers, who typically earn more than private sector workers, the pay pain continues. Those . on salaries of £21,000 or more have been hit by a two-year pay freeze, . followed by a two-year cap on pay rises at an average of just 1 per . cent. The ONS says the average salary is £27,000 – but would be £29,600 if pay had kept up with CPI inflation in recent years. Bills for many essentials, such as food, are still rising sharply. Food prices are 3 per cent higher than last year . The . news comes as the economy is growing at the fastest pace since the . recession began, with business lobby group the CBI hailing the . ‘recovery’. Last . week, Chancellor George Osborne told MPs on the Treasury Select . Committee: ‘As the economy recovers, that is the route to a sustained . increase in the living standards of the people who live in that economy. You can’t pretend that the two aren’t connected – that you can have a living standards plan without an economy plan.’ On target: Consumer price inflation is hovering just above the Bank of England's target rates of 2 per cent, official figures showed today . Unchanged: Despite the fall in consumer price inflation retail prices remained unchanged in the month, the ONS said. Overall, the ONS figures show that the rate of inflation has been falling for the last three months, from 2.7 per cent in September to 2.1 per cent  in November. However, none of the recently announced energy price rises are included in the figures, with most of the increases coming into effect this month and next month. Bills for many essentials, such as food, are still rising sharply. Food prices are 3 per cent higher than last year. Unions have promised to fight for better rises next year if bosses are not generous. Falling prices: The fall in the cost of food, previously a strong contributor to inflation in recent years, helped inflation lower in November . Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said recently: ‘Strike action is always the last  resort. But people are feeling frustrated. ‘If the economy is on the road to recovery then people will want their fair share of the rewards. They’ve been told to tighten their belts for years now. They are looking to have a fair share of that recovery.’ Bob Crow, general secretary of the militant Rail Maritime and Transport Workers’ union, said that it will fight ‘with every tool at our disposal for pay awards and improvements in working conditions.’","Longest pay squeeze in history expected to end next year .

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 18:28 EST, 15 February 2012 . The weeping widower of a woman murdered 26 years ago testified Wednesday about a love triangle that prosecutors believe led his former lover - then a Los Angeles police officer - to kill his wife. Defendant Stephanie Lazarus avoided the gaze of witness John Ruetten as he said he never considered Lazarus to be his girlfriend, even though they had a long sexual relationship. 'What was your understanding of the relationship?' Deputy District Attorney Shannon Presby asked. 'We were good friends,' Mr Ruetten said. 'We saw each other on and off, and on some of those occasions we had sexual intercourse.' Love triangle: John Reutten, right, married former hospital nursing director Sherri Rasmussen, 29, left, before Stephanie Lazarus, 51, killed her in 1986 . Staring: Lawyers outlined their cases, portraying Stephanie Lazarus, 51, seen in 2009, as either a heartbroken, jilted lover driven to kill her romantic rival or an innocent woman in a web of mishandled scientific evidence . The tall, gray-haired Mr Ruetten was overcome several times during his testimony, pulling tissues from a box on the witness stand to wipe his eyes as he spoke of Sherri Rasmussen, his murdered wife. He also told of his friendship with Lazarus that dated back to their days as students at UCLA. There was only 'necking and fooling around' in their college years, he said. Jurors were shown pictures of them together as college kids, including one of Mr Ruetten with his arm around Lazarus in her cap and gown at graduation. Mr Ruetten, 53, wearing a dark business suit, testified that he met Rasmussen in 1984 at a party and they quickly became a couple. Behind bars: Lazarus's lawyer Mr Overland said the DNA was corrupted over the decades, and a forensic dentist would testify that a bite mark does not match an impression taken of Lazarus's teeth . Resurfacing: The case was reopened in 2005 (left) and investigators followed Lazarus for months. She was finally arrested in 2009, and at the time she was a detective in the LA police department (right) When they were engaged, he said, he felt no need to tell Lazarus because he had not seen her for months. However, . he said she later learned of the engagement, summoned him to her condo . and through tears expressed her love for him. She also asked him to have . sex with her, which he said he did but now considers a stupid move. He . stressed that nothing changed that night. 'Here's the deal,' he said. 'It was clear she was very upset that I was getting married and moving on.' Later, . he said, he confessed the incident to Ms Rasmussen and told her: 'Don't . let this mess us up. I want nothing more in the world than to be . married to you.' He also said he ended all contact with Lazarus, who has pleaded not guilty to the murder of Ms Rasmussen. Happier times: Sherri (left) and John (right) had been married for four months when she was killed . Scene: Lazarus broke into the newlyweds' townhouse then bludgeoned and shot Sherri Rasmussen to death after a confrontation that left blood on the walls . Mum and dad: Neil and Loretta Rasmussen, the parents of shooting victim Sherri Rasmussen, seen in 2009 . Mr . Ruetten identified blissful photos of the couple's wedding on November . 23, 1985. Lazarus did not look up as the photos flashed on a courtroom . screen. Ms Rasmussen was killed on February . 24, 1986, bludgeoned and shot to death by an intruder at the condo where . she and Mr Ruetten lived. Too soon: At the time of her death, Rasumssen (pictured) had been married to Lazarus' former lover for 4 months . Prosecutors are trying to show that Lazarus sought revenge for being spurned by Mr Ruetten. Another . witness, retired Los Angeles police officer Mike Hargreaves, said he . lived at Lazarus' condo for a year and recalled that she woke him once . in the middle of the night and said Mr Ruetten had broken up with her. 'She said John told her he was going to marry someone else,' Mr Hargreaves said. He said Lazarus, who was exceptionally fit, suggested they do 'buddy sit-ups' together and she felt better after that. Mr Ruetten's sister, Gail Lopes, showed jurors a letter to her mother from Lazarus that was postmarked August 6, 1985. In . it, Lazarus told Mrs. Ruetten: ''I'm truly in love with John and the . past year has really torn me up. I wish it didn't end the way it did, . and I don't think I'll ever understand his decision. ' In . subsequent years, Lazarus married and adopted a daughter. She rose to . the rank of detective and was honored for her work in the art forgery . section.

Matthew Barzun is rumoured to be the White House's choice to take one of the most prestigious jobs in American diplomacy. His wife, Brooke, is a member of the family that controls one of the world’s biggest drinks companies, Brown-Forman. The Kentucky-based company has a turnover of £1.6billion and owns the Jack Daniel’s, Southern Comfort and Finlandia Vodka brands. Matthew Barzun is expected to be appointed U.S. ambassador to the UK soon. His wife Brooke is the heiress of a major alcoholic drinks business . Mr Barzun, 42, is the former ambassador to Sweden and a key fundraiser for President Obama, having banked a million dollars from donors and serving as finance chairman for the re-election campaign. Although the appointment to the Court of St James, which comes with occupancy of Winfield House in Regent’s Park, has not been formalised, but is expected to be announced soon, reports the Daily Telegraph. Louis Susman, the current ambassador and a former fundraiser himself, will leave his post in early April. The president has raised eyebrows with key diplomatic appointments going to supporters and fundraisers in the past. He appointed Dan Rooney, the owner of NFL team the Pittsburgh Steelers and a campaigner on Obama's behalf, to the role of U.S. ambassador to Ireland. Brown-Forman owns Jack Daniels, Southern Comfort and Finlandia vodka and has a turnover of $1.6billion . The London role was at one point expected to go to Anna Wintour, the British-born editor of U.S. Vogue. Mr Barzun was raised in Massachusetts and educated at Harvard. He made his money with the gadget news and reviews website CNET, before starting his own consultancy for internet media firms. He has supported the Democratic party from an early age and was a student intern for John Kerry in 1989. The father-of-three can trace his family lineage back to John Winthrop, a wealthy English Puritan lawyer who was instrumental in the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the first major Pilgrim settlement after Plymouth Colony, and a leading light in the colonial movement. Ironically, his puritan beliefs would likely have made him a keen opponent of alcohol. The U.S. Embassy in London was not available for comment.

'Racist sign': The sign, referring to a football game between the Redskins and Kansas City Chiefs, was put up outside a Sonic Drive-in in Belton, Missouri . The sign outside the Sonic Drive-in built was condemned as 'shockingly racist' and 'hateful,' by a professor at Columbia University, while others took to Twitter to air their views. ‘A Sonic in Missouri is run by racist idiots?

Pest: Although friendly charming and inquisitive the wild Barbary Macaques are increasingly running riot through the town¿s streets . Almost half of Gibraltar’s famous monkeys could be shipped off the Rock as they are considered 'fearless' of humans. Although friendly, charming and inquisitive, the wild Barbary Macaques are increasingly running riot through the town’s streets. ‘They’ve lost their fear of humans and regard them as a source of rich food,’ said Gibraltar’s Environment Minister Dr John Cortes. Last week a grandmother was bitten in an unprovoked attack while pushing her baby grandson in a pram. Rose Vinales was among almost sixty people who needed hospital treatment this year after being bitten by one of the monkeys. A government led campaign, titled Get Our Monkeys Back To Nature, has since been launched to teach people not to feed the iconic primates. Feeding the Barbary Macaques is illegal and punishable by a fine but the law is routinely ignored, particularly by tourists who flock to the areas around Apes Den and the Siege Tunnels at the top of the Rock. The campaign is part of a wider action plan being developed by the colony’s government with the support of primate experts at the Born Free Foundation. A boost to a contraceptive programme forms part of the scheme as does ‘the possibility of relocating up to 120 monkeys to north Africa’, according to a government statement. Dr Cortes, an authority on the Barbary Macaques, said that the current population is around 230. He reiterated that culling was not supported by the government. Such a measure would cause outrage though the colony’s shadow environment minister Selwyn Figueras has suggested it should be considered. Banned: Feeding the Barbary Macaques is illegal and punishable by a fine but the law is routinely ignored, particularly by tourists who flock to the areas around Apes Den and the Siege Tunnels at the top of the Rock . Born Free: The campaign is part of a wider action plan being developed by the colony¿s government with the support of primate experts at the Born Free Foundation . Although the Barbary macaque is a much-loved national symbol of Gibraltar mystery surrounds its arrival on the Rock. Their existence was noted by the first chronicler of Gibraltar in the early 17th century. Outside Gibraltar, the remaining wild populations in Algeria and Morocco are under threat. Gibraltar’s monkey were under the often affectionate care of the British Army, and later the Gibraltar Regiment, from 1915 to 1991. Sgt. Alfred Holmes was one well remembered Officer-in-Charge of the monkeys who cared for, fed, nursed and named the monkeys for almost thirty years from the mid-1950s. Royal feed: Monkeys queue up for a peanut from Prince Charles, left, and Princess Anne, right, when the when they visited Gibraltar's famous colony in 1954 . Holmes described the monkeys as Gibraltar’s 'greatest treasure' and even ensured any sick animals were attended by the same doctors as soldiers at the Royal Naval Hospital. In the past they have died from flu. A belief that the Rock will stay British as long as the monkeys remain was behind a move by Sir Winston Churchill to import monkeys when the Gibraltar population plummeted to just seven individuals during World War Two. The species is commonly referred to as the 'Barbary ape' though the light brown animal is actually a stubby-tailed monkey. Dr Cortes said the campaign would present challenges but would succeed with community support.","Environment minister: 'They regard humans as a source of rich food'

The Sportsman Channel said Monday it has hired Sarah Palin to be host of a weekly outdoors program that will celebrate her ‘red, wild and blue’ lifestyle. Amazing America will debut in April and become the fourth reality show to follow the Palin brood, but faces an uphill battle if her previous attempt is any indication. Palin’s 2010 foray into the genre, Sarah Palin’s Alaska, lasted for just eight episodes on TLC. And her family’s luck with reality TV hasn’t always been much better. Mother of them all: Sarah Palin will debut in her family's fourth foray into reality television in April. Amazing America will document Palin's 'red, wild and blue' lifestyle and air on the Sportsman Channel . The Sportsman Channel is in some 32 million homes, less than one-third of American households with television, with programming geared to people interested in hunting, fishing and shooting. Palin's show will include a series of stories about personalities and activities in that vein. ‘It's very important to have somebody of her stature as a personality on Sportsman because it validates the whole category for everybody,’ said Gavin Harvey, network CEO. The Sportsman Channel has ordered 12 episodes of the series to start. It's the first of a three-series deal between the network and the busy nonfiction production company Pilgrim Studios. ‘The network showcases a lifestyle . that I love and celebrate every day and it's great to be a part of their . team,’ Palin said in a statement provided by the network. Mama bear: The show will be Palin's second reality series after 2010's short-lived Sarah Palin's Alaska on TLC . Punting her punditry?

Dean Cain, 98 Degrees singer Nick Lachey, and retired four star U.S. Army general Wesley Clark. Sarah and Todd Palin’s daughter Bristol, whose unplanned teen pregnancy became fodder for Palin detractors during her failed vice presidential bid, twice appeared on ABC’s Dancing with the Stars--in 2010 and 2012. She was voted off both times. That same year, Bistol appeared in a Lifetime series Bristol Palin: Life’s a Tripp, which followed her life in Alaska as a young single mom.

Bristol, too: The couple's daughter Bristol starred in her own reality series, Lifetime's short-lived Life's a Tripp . Maybe even 5 or 6: If you count Dancing with the Stars--on which Bristol has appeared as a contestant two times--the Palins have had 5 (or 6) forays into reality TV . The show attracted immediate criticism and multiple lawsuits and was quickly replaced in primetime with reruns of Dance Moms. Owners . of The Sportsman Channel tried and failed this year to buy its chief . competitor, the Outdoors Channel, which airs in slightly more . households. The effort attracted some controversy because Leo Hindery Jr., a media executive whose company owns The Sportsman Channel, is a Democratic fundraiser and regarded warily by politically conservative outdoor enthusiasts who worried about what he might do to Outdoors. Some of the content on The Sportsman Channel suggests they shouldn't be too concerned. Besides the upcoming Palin series, Sportsman airs a series with conservative activist and rock musician Ted Nugent. Sportsman also airs a TV version of the National Rifle Association-sponsored radio show, ‘NRA News, Cam & Co.,’ each weekday and ‘NRA Guns & Gold,’ a show about guns styled after ‘Antiques Roadshow.’ Harvey said The Sportsman Channel has no interest in being politically polarizing. ‘It's not our intention at Sportsman to take any political position,’ he said. ‘This lifestyle, coast to coast, crosses every type of political spectrum.’ Another high profile show on Sportsman that ran this summer, Aporkalypse: 2013, was about the growth in the feral pig population.

Jennifer Aniston was eighth on a list after her latest three films made minimal returns . She commands up to £6.5million a film. But Jennifer Aniston might not be able to bank on such high fees much longer. The former Friends actress has found herself on the list of Hollywood’s ten most overpaid stars. Following a string of box-office flops, 44-year-old Miss Aniston appears in eighth place in Forbes magazine’s list of stars who provide the least value for their huge fees. The publication examined the costs of each actor’s last three films up until June 1st 2013, adding up salaries and production costs. They then compared that with the film’s box office returns to find out which actors were the least bankable. The star’s last three films, Wanderlust, Horrible Bosses and Just Go With It cost a total of £93m to make, including her salary costs, but brought in just under £450m. In contrast, the world’s highest-grossing film over the past year has been Iron Man 3, which cost £122m to make and made £741m at the box office. It starred Gwyneth Paltrow and Robert Downey Jr. Aniston shot to fame in 1994 playing Rachel Green in US sitcom Friends, which ran until 2004. The role earned her an Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Her biggest box office success to date was her appearance in 2003 film Bruce Almighty, in which she starred alongside Jim Carrey. The film cost £49.5m to make before going on to make almost £300m at the box office. US comedy star Adam Sandler, who is paid almost £10m per film, topped this year’s list of overpaid stars after his last two blockbusters Jack & Jill and That’s My Boy struggled to justify their dizzying production costs. Flop? Forbes found Horrible Bosses, starring Jennifer Aniston as Dr. Julia Harris, made a small return . Wanderlust, in which Aniston as Linda starred with Paul Rudd as George, was on of three unsuccessful recent films . Adding to the figures, Just Go With It, in which Aniston played Katherine, also failed to make an impact . Jack & Jill grossed £91m at the box office, but the film cost an estimated almost £50 million to make. Considering studios take home about half of box office receipts, that means only about £45m went to Sony, who also had to pay to advertise the film. That’s My Boy did even worse. With an estimated budget of £42m, the film brought in only £35m at the box office worldwide. Forbes magazine estimated that for every dollar Sandler was paid on his last three movies, the films returned an average of $3.40. His most recent film, Grown Ups 2 grossed £150m at the box office on an estimated £49m budget, making it one of Sandler’s best performing films. However, the magazine’s survey includes films that were released before June 1st this. Grown Ups 2 was released in July. Top of the list: Adam Sandler topped the list and Katherine Heigl was second. According to Forbes, every dollar Sandler was paid on his last three films returned $3.40 on average. Meanwhile Heigl only trumped him by $0.10 . His animated film Hotel Transylvania grossed £218m at the box office worldwide on a budget of £52m, but it was not enough to offset his other two films. Close behind Sandler in second place is Katherine Heigl. For every dollar she was paid Heigl returned an average of $3.50. Reese Witherspoon came in third place with an average $3.90 return for every one dollar she was paid. Last year, comedy star Eddie Murphy topped the list, while Drew Barrymore was named the most overpaid film star in 2011. Nicole Kidman came in first place in 2008.","Forbes compared cost of films, including stars' pay, with box office returns .

As Susan Boyle was catapulted into the public eye on Britain’s Got Talent, fans watched as she struggled to cope with the rigours of a rapid rise to fame. Yesterday the multi-millionaire singer opened up for the first time about her difficulties – revealing she has been diagnosed with Asperger’s. The talent show runner-up said that  she feels ‘relieved’ to finally understand her condition, which until now has gone undetected. Asperger's: Singing star Susan Boyle opened up about her difficulties in an interview with Hello! magazine . Susan Boyle was blackmailed by her older brother Gerry, who threatened to kill himself if she did not part with £50,000, it has been reported . The 52-year-old had always thought the ‘learning difficulties’ and ‘slowness’ she experienced had been caused by complications at birth. But a year ago Miss Boyle visited a Scottish specialist who later diagnosed her with Asperger’s – a form of autism that mainly affects social interaction and communication skills. After claiming she was misdiagnosed with brain damage as a child – and cruelly dubbed ‘Susan Simple’ at school – Miss Boyle said she now feels more relaxed in her own skin. She told Observer Magazine: ‘I always knew it was an unfair label. Now I have a clearer understanding of what’s wrong and I feel relieved and a bit more relaxed about myself.’ 'Relief': Susan, who has previously admitted she struggled with 'learning difficulties' and 'slowness', said it was good to finally be diagnosed . For Miss Boyle the symptoms have been subtle but she admitted the diagnosis finally explained why she has suffered from anxiety around strangers and delayed eye contact . Miss Boyle has always struggled with her health. Suffering from depression as a young . woman in Blackburn, Glasgow, the isolation it caused made her more . determined ‘to be where I want to be’. But knowing she has Asperger’s has now helped explain why she also suffered from anxiety around strangers and struggled with eye contact – making her feel ‘different’ and ‘an outsider’ throughout her childhood. She added: ‘It’s a condition that I have to live with and work through, but I feel more relaxed about myself. People will have a greater understanding of who I am and why I do the things I do. Interview: Susan Boyle spoke about the condition in the latest issue of Hello! magazine . ‘I have communicative difficulties, which leads to a lot of frustration. If people were a bit more patient it would help.’ Miss Boyle shot to fame in 2009 when her audition on the ITV1 talent show became a global sensation on YouTube. But the sudden fame made the singer’s Asperger’s more difficult to manage and she went into rehab after coming second in the final. The I Dreamed A Dream singer, who has previously spoken about her struggles with depression, says she is now in a healthy and positive place. She said: ‘Mental illness carries less stigma now. It’s not indulgence, it’s a negative process, but if you can turn it into a positive it makes you stronger. Believe me.’ Miss Boyle employs a team of people to help her combat her anxiety difficulties, adding: ‘I’m not strong on my own.’ People with Asperger’s often struggle to understand conversation and have difficulty comprehending gestures, facial expressions or tone of voice. Initiating and sustaining social relationships can be tricky, and it can sometimes lead to an intense, sometimes obsessive, interest in a hobby or collecting. Mark Lever, of The National Autistic Society, said public understanding of Asperger’s can make a ‘huge difference’. He added: ‘By revealing her diagnosis, Susan has played an important role in bringing the issue of autism to the nation’s attention.’ Miss Boyle is this month releasing a duet with Elvis Presley – with technology used to combine her vocals with those of the American icon, who died in 1977. The single, O Come All Ye Faithful, is raising money for Save The Children. Asperger syndrome is a form of autism, which is a lifelong disability that affects how a person makes sense of the world, processes information and relates to other people. It is often described as a 'spectrum disorder' because the condition affects people in many different ways and to varying degrees. The main problematic triggers are social communication, social interaction and social imagination. Asperger’s sufferers struggle with understanding conversation, with extreme cases finding  every day conversation as difficult as a foreign language. Sufferers can often find it difficult to pick up social cues and find it hard to know what to do when they get things wrong. The characteristics of Asperger syndrome vary from one person to another but as well as the three main areas of difficulty, people with the condition may have a love of routinesspecial interests and sensory difficulties. People with Asperger syndrome may develop an intense, sometimes obsessive, interest in a hobby or collecting. It is not caused by a person's upbringing, their social circumstances and is not the fault of the individual with the condition.

A Japanese website believes it has confirmation that the successor to iPhone 5 will be called the . iPhone 5S, and that Apple’s rumoured low-cost iPhone . will be known as the iPhone 5C. The website Macotakara said that its 'sources in Asia' have confirmed the names, which have long been under speculation. The C in the iPhone 5C is thought to stand for 'colour' which could suggest that the phone will come in a range of colours, rather than the standard black and white options. Apple is set to officially unveil the new generation iPhone at an event next month, insiders say. The new generation iPhone expected to be launched on September 10 will run new software iOS 7 and possibly include a finger-print scanner . It is believed the event, allegedly . on September 10, will see the launch of the upcoming iPhone 5S and . possibly also a rumoured iPhone 5C 'low-cost' device. Indicated updates on the iPhone 5S . include sensor which can identify the owner by his or her fingerprints. Photographs have leaked of a smartphone . dubbed ‘5C’, supposedly intended as a cheaper version of the popular . iPhone, with a plastic case. Due to its relatively expensive price tag, Apple is struggling to succeed in emerging markets, something which the rumoured September event could change, according to AllthingsD. Previously the company has solved this problem by offering its old models at a lower price, but cheaper Android phones have seen their market share dip, the tech-website said. Rumoured updates on the new iPhone 5S include an slow-motion camera and a fingerprint sensor since a string of code in the latest release of its latest iOS7 Software implied a scanner function. According to TechCrunch, values can range depending on a variety of factors, including device colour, physical damage and liquid damage . The code describes a user touching the . Home button with their thumb. A fingerprint then appears on the screen, . that changes colour - presumably to signify a match - and the . 'recognition is complete'. More . code discovered in iOS 7 suggests phones running the software will be . able to record video at a rate of 120 frames-per-second (FPS) rather . than around 30 frames per second. This is fast enough to allow iPhone users to create slow-motion films. The iOS 7 software also lets users swipe between menus, select apps and control the device's screen using just head movements. A string of developer code discovered in the fourth beta release of Apple's iOS 7 software, pictured, gives the strongest indication to date that either the iPhone 5S or the iPhone 6 could have a fingerprint scanner . When the Switch Control feature is enabled, it will scroll through and highlight different onscreen sections - including individual menus and apps. When the required section is highlighted, users can move their head to the left to select it. Other new features include Night Mode in Maps that responds to ambient light when you use it in the dark. The new iOS7 software for iPhone includes a radical redesign of menus and icons as well as improved notifications and better photo-organising abilities.","Macotakara said that its 'sources in Asia' have confirmed the names .

Looks like Mother Nature is taking seriously the NFL’s slogan for the upcoming Super Bowl: Best Served Cold. One week before kickoff, on the day the Broncos and Seahawks arrived in the frozen Big Apple, Sunday brought a bit of a thaw. Temperatures actually reached the low 20s. Hardly balmy.

Big game: Seattle Seahawks players arrive at the Newark International Airport to finish off their preparations for the 48th Super Bowl against the Denver Broncos . No one will know for sure until kick-off whether bringing the Super Bowl to an open-air stadium for the first time in the chilly East of the country in February was a big mistake. It's too soon to tell whether Super Bowl Sunday will bring anything dramatic weather-wise, but meteorologists say there will be a weaker cold front arriving Thursday which will bring only light snow. It may be slightly warmer closer to the weekend, with temperatures looking as if they'll hit the 30s, but there could still be sleet, snow or freezing rain. Not that the guys who will take the field at MetLife Stadium have any complaints or concerns. They would play this one on the New Jersey tundra or in Death Valley. 'My team is excited,' Peyton Manning said after the Broncos’ flight landed in New Jersey. 'We worked hard to earn this opportunity. We couldn’t be more excited. 'We were excited getting on that plane and excited getting off that plane.' The average low temperature for the date of the Super Bowl in Jersey is 24 degrees Fahrenheit, according to AccuWeather.com. Fans will get Warm Welcome packs that include ear muffs, hand warmers and lip balm to try and combat the chill.

Frosty reception: A man runs in the snow along the East River in Brooklyn Bridge Park, New York, USA, 21 January 2014. Snow and sub-zero temperatures continue to be forecast in the region, according to weather reports . What the Broncos and Seahawks must understand is that the upcoming week is unlike anything else they experienced during the season. Or during any season. More media, for sure. A glaring spotlight on everything. Spending a week away from home. Practicing in another team’s facility: the Seahawks at the Giants’ complex across the parking lots from MetLife Stadium, the Broncos at the Jets’ place in Florham Park, about 30 minutes from the Meadowlands. Both coaches, Denver’s John Fox and Seattle’s Pete Carroll, expressed concern about the outdoor practice fields being covered with snow or frozen. Neither sounded eager about working indoors the entire week. Just another inconvenience that goes along with the Super Bowl, although the NFL said the outdoor fields will be available for practices. 'Our mentality is strong,' Carroll said. 'I think we know how to play in games like this. Hopefully we will be able to maintain that mentality that allows us to do the things we do.' Forecast unclear: Snow falls as tourists take in the New York skyline from Brooklyn Bridge Park, New York . Times Square prepares: As part of festivities, the NFL is sponsoring activities along 'Super Bowl Boulevard', located on Broadway between 34th and 47th streets in Manhattan . Not one regular Seahawks player has been this far, giving Denver something of an edge in experience. The Broncos have four: receiver Wes Welker, tight end Jacob Tamme, cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and some quarterback named Peyton. Manning, of course, is the only current Bronco to have won a ring, with Indianapolis in 2007. He also lost the Super Bowl in 2010 with the Colts. 'The Super Bowl is a big deal,' he said. 'I know how hard it is to get here. I know the sacrifice the team made.' That they will sacrifice the comfort of playing in a dome, or in a warm climate, in this Super Bowl doesn’t seem to be fazing them a bit. Instead, the Broncos want to embrace the cold, the winds, the snow — and everything else that comes along this week in the first Super Bowl ever played outdoors in a cold-weather city. 'We’d love to play in 70-degree weather,' said Denver 15-year veteran cornerback Champ Bailey, who has reached his first title game. 'But if you tell me it’s 20 degrees and I am playing in the Super Bowl, I’m going to take it.'

Snow capped: The New York area has been experiencing heavy snowfall and bitter cold in the lead-up to the first outdoor Super Bowl . Dedicated: Denver Broncos fans wait for the players to arrive at the team hotel Sunday, January 26, 2014, in Jersey City, New Jersey . Welker, who lost both of his trips to the Super Bowl with the Patriots before joining the Broncos this season as a free agent, fully understands the issues that can arise this week. He and Manning, in particular, have counseled teammates on those pitfalls. 'It’s knowing what to expect, trying to get rid of all the nonsense that goes with the Super Bowl,' Welker said. The Seahawks certainly didn’t find their send-off in Seattle to be nonsensical, even if it got a little 'extraordinary,' as Carroll dubbed it. 'At the airport, what usually takes us about one minute to get through took 20 minutes,' defensive end Cliff Avril said about the 'thousands and thousands' of fans lining the bus route. 'They were pretty close, and we were hitting the windows inside. It was a blast.'That’s a lot of 12th Men saluting their team. 'The 12s were out there in full force,' Carroll said.","The Bronos and the Seahawks NFL teams both arrive in Newark today .

Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 4: ‘You saw what Ed Balls said yesterday, which as far as I can see was that if he had his time over again, he would probably spend even more. ‘I think these people who seem to have learnt absolutely nothing from what went wrong with our economy, that the problems were based on too much borrowing, too much spending, too much debt, and they’re really saying: “If you gave us the key to the car, we would drive  it in exactly the same way into exactly the same wall”.’ Mr Cameron later met small businesses including boat builder and restorer John Watson at Lots Ait Boatyard in Brentford, west London . Mr Cameron later told a conference of the Federation of Small Businesses in London that the Labour proposals may be ‘politically convenient’ but would be ‘very, very bad for our economy’. ‘We've cut the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p. I think it was the right step to take. I always knew it wouldn't be particularly popular but I thought it was the right thing to do because I want to take steps in this country that are going to encourage investment, going to encourage jobs, going to encourage growth, going to encourage business to invest more,’ said the PM. The plan to increase the top rate of tax sparked a ferocious response from business leaders, with 24 warning in a letter to the Daily Telegraph it would ‘put the economic recovery at risk’ and cost jobs. Mr Cameron added: ‘From all the reaction I've seen over the last 48 hours since Ed Balls and Labour made their announcement, it only confirms me in that view. ‘We've now got former Labour minister after former Labour minister alongside a huge number of people in business to say that putting up the top rate of tax would cost jobs, cost investment, it is an anti-business, anti-enterprise, anti-growth measure. ‘I would argue that, just as I think what George Osborne and I did was right for the economy but politically difficult,  Labour are now doing something that's politically convenient but is very, very bad for our economy’. Mr Cameron warned Labour was putting political point-scoring ahead of what was good for the economy but Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls insisting taxing people earning more than £150,000 would help to bring down the deficit . However, increasing the rate of tax rate for the highest earners is hugely popular with voters. Mr Balls told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine that the Prime Minister and Chancellor George Osborne ‘know in their heart of hearts they can't justify a massive tax cut to the richest when everybody else is worse off and paying more tax’. ‘I think a fair approach to deficit reduction means those with the broadest shoulders need to bear their share of the burden,’ he said. ‘I don't think this is an anti-business move, I don't think it's bad for Britain. I think it is a fair way to get the deficit down.’ Asked if it was not already a fair share that the top 1 per cent of earners paid 29.8 per cent of all income tax, he said their proportion was so high ‘because people are earning huge amounts of money, and rightly so in some cases’. The 50p rate had raised £10 billion more than expected, he said, and the subsequent cut to 45p had cost the Exchequer £3 billion and given top earners an average £10,000 tax cut.","Prime Minister claims opposition would borrow more to keep spending .

"PUBLISHED: . 17:01 EST, 26 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 09:46 EST, 27 January 2014 . Cull: The Western Australia government began placing baited hooks on drum lines off popular beaches in the state capital Perth and to the south to kill white, bull and tiger sharks (such as the one pictured) over 10ft long . A large shark was killed off the west Australian coast on Sunday, the first under a contentious new state government culling policy aimed at curbing fatal shark attacks. The Western Australia government on Saturday began placing baited hooks on drum lines off popular beaches in the state capital Perth and to the south to kill white, bull and tiger sharks over 10ft long. The policy is a response to seven fatal shark attacks in Australia's southwest in three years. Government spokesman Simon Beaumont said the first shark was killed by a government-contracted commercial fisherman on Sunday morning off Castle Rock near the town of Dunsborough, 155 miles south of Perth. The shark was longer than three meters (10 feet) and was one of the three targeted species. Beaumont would not say which of the three species it was. Once the fisherman had confirmed with fishing authorities that the shark was the required species and size, he shot it and dumped the carcass at sea, Beaumont said. The policy has divided the community since it was announced several weeks ago and led to thousands of people demonstrating on Perth beaches against the shark cull. Activists have threatened to sabotage the drum lines and threatened one fisherman who had accepted a government contract to catch sharks off Perth. He pulled out, citing the threats. The federal government last week gave state authorities a special exemption from environmental laws to kill white sharks, a protected species. Environmentalists argue that there is no evidence that the cull will reduce shark attacks. They argue it could even increase the shark danger by giving water users a false sense of security. 'To think that we're wasting this opportunity to tag and to find out more about these creatures, that we're just going to slaughter them and dump them - it's just such a waste of life,' Rae Threnoworth, member of marine conservation group Sea Shepherd, told Ten Network television. State Premier Colin Barnett was heckled by members of the public over the shark's death as he officiated at a citizenship ceremony in Perth on Sunday. 'I get no pleasure out of seeing sharks killed,' Barnett told reporters. 'But I have an overriding responsibility to protect the people of Western Australia. That's what I'm doing.'

The pensioner travelled the world and bought works of art while fraudulently claiming more than £36,500 in benefits . A pensioner travelled the world and splashed out on expensive works of art while falsely claiming more than £36,000 in benefits, a court was told. Susan Mary Robinson, from Llangennith, near Swansea, travelled to Hawaii, Bali and New York and spent 'a large amount of money' on art but neglected to mention she had £20,000 sitting in a bank account. At Swansea Magistrates Court, 68-year-old Robinson admitted dishonestly claimed housing and council tax benefits and pension credits for almost six years. Julie Sullivan, for the prosecution, said Robinson had inherited the cash from her mother, and had told investigators it was not for her benefit but for her grandchildren. However, inquiries showed she had used it for trips to New York, Hawaii, Bali, Canada and the south of France, as well as to places in Britain, and had spent 'a large amount of money on art works and various other purchases'. Robinson pleaded guilty to two counts of dishonestly failing to notify the authorities of circumstances affecting her claims for benefits and pension credits between 2007 and 2013, the total overpayment she received during that period was £36,573.42. Probation officer Fred Matthews, who had interviewed Robinson about the background to the claims, told the court she had misunderstood the system. He said: 'Miss Robinson tells me there was a misunderstanding not a deliberate attempt to defraud the public purse.' Susan Mary Robinson visited a host of far-flung destinations including Hawaii (pictured), Bali and New York . He added that she had always worked and was 'not au fait with how the system worked' and felt a degree of shame about what had happened. Nick Devonald, for Robinson, said the ordeal of being arrested, charged and taken to court was a punishment in itself, as was the upset his client had caused her own family. He urged magistrates to suspend any custodial sentence. The court heard Robinson has no previous convictions and has already paid back £11,000. Magistrates handed her a four month jail sentence for each of the two offences, suspended for 18 months. She was also told to pay £85 in prosecution costs and an £80 victim surcharge.","Susan Mary Robinson from Llangennith, Wales, falsely claimed £36,000 in housing and council tax benefits and pension credits over six years .

Concerns: Labour MP Tom Watson has been investigating paedophile networks since the Jimmy Savile controversy erupted in 2012 . A Labour MP has demanded renewed and wider inquiries into the Paedophile Information Exchange amid fears that government files proving it received taxpayers’ cash have been shredded. An ex-civil servant has previously claimed the government gave money to the PIE – which called paedophiles ‘ordinary, decent, sensible human beings’ – during the 1970s. Home Secretary Theresa May has asked Mark Sedwill, the permanent secretary at the Home Office, to investigate after details of the claims were passed on by Labour MP Tom Watson. Last night Mr Watson welcomed the probe but also demanded a wider-ranging police inquiry into the PIE. He claimed Scotland Yard’s paedophile squad, which is running an investigation called Operation Fernbridge into claims that an establishment paedophile ring preyed on children in care in the 1980s, is ‘chronically under-resourced’. But last night there were mounting fears that all government papers on its links to the PIE have been shredded. Sources said everything that the Home Office held on PIE post-1979 appears to have been destroyed, except for the titles. It is understood that a total of 11 PIE files dating from 1979 to the mid-1980s have been identified. The Home Office insists ‘their destruction was consistent with applicable record retention policies’. Mr Watson said: ‘I was contacted by a former Home Office civil servant who told me that he saw a document that suggests the Paedophile Information Exchange got public money. ‘The document was recommending approval for funding during the Thatcher government. My source, who does not wish to talk to the media, said it appeared to be a  re-application for funds. He could not be certain whether or not it had been funded by a Labour government but he thought this was possible.’ Mr Watson has been investigating paedophile networks since the Jimmy Savile controversy erupted in 2012 and he has worked closely with the police to pass on information from private sources. But he said officers have got their work cut out. ‘Operation Fernbridge is chronically under-resourced,’ he said. ‘They have arrested members of PIE but what they’re not doing is looking systematically at everyone who was in PIE. ‘They are pursuing specific allegations by victims but don’t have the resources to conduct a general inquiry. Given the extreme public concern about PIE, there should be a properly resourced investigation into what the PIE got up to.’ Probe: Mark Sedwill, left, permanent secretary at the Home Office, has been asked by Home Secretary Theresa May, right, to investigate after Mr Watson passed claims that a paedophile group received public money . Mr Watson’s comments will be a matter of great concern for Met chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe and his senior commanders, who are under pressure to take allegations of historic child sex abuse more seriously in the aftermath of Savile. It is unclear when the Home Office inquiry into PIE will be completed, or whether retired civil servants with knowledge of the issue are being interviewed. But a well-placed source said there is a growing belief that the paedophile group did indeed receive public money. The source added: ‘There is a lot of concern in the highest levels of Government about what may unravel.’ The PIE was established in 1974 to campaign for the age of consent to be lowered to four. A year later the National Council for Civil Liberties – today known as the human rights watchdog Liberty – controversially granted official ‘affiliate’ status to the group. One leaflet sent by the PIE to MPs claimed: ‘Paedophiles are ordinary, decent, sensible human beings, no more sexually depraved than yourself, and with a capacity for loving and helping children which is at present being repressed.’ However, within a few years the harm caused by paedophiles became public and many of PIE’s activists were jailed. It was disbanded in 1984. Last night, Mr Watson said the Conservatives have questions to answer about alleged cover-ups of paedophilia in their ranks. He claimed the Tories tried to suppress the case of diplomat Sir Peter Hayman, who was jailed in 1984 for posting child pornography. Mr Watson added: ‘The shared shame of all the political parties is that they can do more – much more – to protect kids who face abuse.’","Tom Watson MP also demands wider police inquiry into paedophile group .

Asia's main stock markets continued to fall today amid concerns that trouble in China's credit system could hurt growth in the world's second-largest economy. Chinese stocks extended the previous day's heady declines as investors worried that measures to curb so-called shadow banking - the unregulated lending to companies starved of credit by China's traditional banks - would cause an increase in borrowing rates for many firms, hurting business. The Shanghai Composite Index fell another 0.2 per cent to close at 1,959.51 after plunging nearly 6 percent the day before, its biggest loss in four years. Markets stabilized elsewhere, however, with European indexes rebounding. Is the bubble set to burst?

Ripple effect: A trader on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, where the Dow dropped nearly 140 points to close at 14,659.56 following China and Federal Reserve concerns . Besides China's credit problems, markets have also been jolted by an increase in U.S. bond yields. The rise is due to expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon start winding down its monetary stimulus, allowing borrowing rates to edge up from their current lows as the economy improves. The Fed's bond-buying stimulus program has been keeping rates low, encouraging traders to buy riskier assets such as stocks and to invest in emerging markets, driving many equity indexes to record or multiyear highs. Concern over how markets will handle the end to the program, however, has made investors nervous and caused volatility. Investors will later in the day monitor U.S. figures on durable goods sales and consumer confidence to judge the strength of household spending, a key pillar of the world's largest economy.

The contract rose $1.49 to close at $95.18 in New York on Monday. In currencies, the euro was steady at $1.3119 while the dollar fell 0.5 percent against the Japanese yen, to 97.26 yen. As local financial markets closed today, China's central bank said it would not turn the screws too hard on banks in its drive to curb easy credit, as it sought to allay fears of a banking crisis. The People's Bank of China wants to curtail the diversion of funds to a vast informal loan market as it seeks to shore up growth in the world's second biggest economy, but its tough stance has raised fears of a lasting credit crunch. 'Currently, the liquidity risk in the banking system is under control,' said Ling Tao, vice governor of the Shanghai branch of the PBOC at a press conference. 'We will stabilise market expectations and guide market rate interest rates to reasonable levels.' Anticipation of what Ling would say after the markets closed had earlier helped to spark a remarkable turnaround in the stock market, as rattled investors hoped for some respite from the central bank.","Shanghai Composite Index suffered biggest percentage loss in four years .

Becoming a little turned around after a pub crawl could now be a thing of the past for barflies in Leeds, as a dedicated drinker has designed a London Tube-style map that charts bars, restaurants and pubs all over the city. The 'Leeds Oderaround' was created by Steve Lovell, and features a massive 563 locations across the northern city, replacing tube stations with drinking, eating, and lodging establishments. Mr Lovell, 39, spent over a year of his spare time designing the drinker's guide, using both virtual and physical mapping methods to complete the project. The 'Leeds Orderaround' map, drawing from the iconic London Underground design, the map details the locations of 563 pubs and bars in Leeds . Steve Lovell, a former graphic design student, took over a year to create the map, walking dozens of miles in his efforts . The former Leeds University graphic design student clocked up dozens of miles walking the city, and taking virtual street tours. Most of his mapping efforts were to make sure that the pubs he was listing on his map were still open and operational, as many might have been closed or renamed. Mr Lovell said: 'Having always admired the design of the London Underground map and going out in Leeds, I decided to do this project to combine the two. the map could easily be used to chart the routes of a pub crawl, or just more easily locate a pub in the city that you've always wanted to try . Steve Lovell plans to sell the maps on his website for £10 each . 'It's been over a year in development on and off in my spare time. 'It's been deceptively long and hard work, but I'm very happy with the finished result. 'I've had lots of kind comments about it already and it does make me feel quite proud. 'Friends and neighbours have said that they are really impressed with it and when I had my photograph taken complete strangers came up to me and said they really wanted one.' Because the project took over a year to complete, Mr Lovell found that many of the sites he had listed at the start had become obsolete, and so his map required constant updating. Lovell both walked dozens of miles, and used virtual mapping techniques to make make sure that every pub, restaurant and bar was actually open and operational, and that they hadn't changed their name, so that his map was completely correct . He said: 'Since starting the project I've had to remove a lot of pubs that have closed down and even been demolished and that's always sad. 'About a quarter-of-a-mile from my house there was a pub that had been demolished before it had been printed. 'It is quite sad to see so many close and come off the map in the 12 months I have created it. 'But it is also nice to see that some new places are also opening up, but mostly in the city centre. 'When I was putting it together there were lots of places that I wouldn't know about and places that I never even knew existed. 'I can't say I've been to all of the places on the map and probably never will, but I've been to lots of places I didn't know about before as a result of researching and designing this.' Lovell's maps cost £10 and are available from www.albanydesign.co.uk. Rugby player Danny Cipriani after being released from hospital after his accident being hit by a bus on a Leeds pub crawl .

Taxes on bingo would be slashed under plans being considered by George Osborne to bolster the Tories’ image among working class voters. The Chancellor is examining plans to cut to 20 per cent duty on earnings from bingo to 15 per cent, in line with online gambling and betting on horse races. It is claimed the move would lead to bigger bingo prizes, investment in tired bingo halls and more jobs in some of the country’s poorest areas. Pulling power: Chancellor George Osborne is considering cutting the tax on bingo halls to bolster support among working class voters . The Chancellor tried his hand at pulling a pint at the Red Lion pub in Whitehall which has reopened after a refurbishment . The idea of a tax cut for bingo could become a totemic issue for the Conservatives at a time when the party is desperate to shed its image as being dominated by ‘out of touch’ southerners. The plan has been discussed by Treasury ministers and could be announced by Mr Osborne as part of next month’s Budget aimed at wooing working families. To burnish his man of the people credentials, the Chancellor was last night seen pulling pints in the Red Lion pub near Downing Street. Tory party chairman Grant Shapps yesterday claimed his was the Workers’ Party. In a speech he said: ‘We are the party on the side of the whole nation. We are the party on the side of working people. The economic recovery has been boosted by new figures showing Britain has become less reliant on consumer spending. New data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reveals that business investment rose by 2.4 per cent quarter on quarter in the final three months of 2013. It came as the ONS confirmed that the economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the last three months of 2013. However the pace of growth overall last year was nudged down to 1.8 per cent from the previous estimate of 1.9 per cent. Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed the figures, saying in a message on Twitter that they provided 'more encouraging news our long-term economic plan is working'. The figures from the ONS showed that, while business investment picked up sharply from growth of 2 per cent in the third quarter, household spending rose by a more muted 0.4 per cent between October and December, down from 0.9 per cent growth in the previous three months. Compared with a year earlier, business investment was 8.5 per cent higher. ‘Our politics isn't about a list of statistics and numbers. There is a moral purpose to it, a mission.’ Bingo clubs are closing at a rate of one a month, according to the Bingo Association. More than 1,000 jobs have been lost since 2012. The industry has promised to invest an extra £30milliuon in new clubs, better community facilities and more jobs if the duty is reduced to 15 per cent. The issue is being championed by Tory MP Robert Halfon, who has previously successfully lobbied ministers  on fuel duty and energy companies. A petition signed by 300,000 people backing the Boost Bingo campaign is being presented to Number 11 Downing Street today. Mr . Halfon told MailOnline: ‘What we need is a level playing field for . bingo so we boost bingo clubs, boost investment, boost jobs and boost . bingo prizes. ‘It will put . millions back into the game. Bingo is not gambling. It is a social club . and a community activity for working men and women, of all ages. ‘It is very much about supporting working people and supporting our communities.’ There are 54,000 members of . bingo hall in Mr Halfon’s Harlow constituency alone. He said that if Mr . Osborne announces the tax cut in next month’s Budget, it has to be part . of a wider message to voters that the Tories are on their side. ‘It . is not just a tax cut. We have got huge bingo clubs, many are closing . because they cannot afford to ru because of this tax. It means . regeneration and jobs in some of our poorest communities.’ The Treasury has refused to be drawn on the plans for bingo tax ahead of the Budget on March 19. Exchequer Secretary David Gauke said: ‘The Government keeps all taxes, including bingo duty, under review.’ Cutting the tax on bingo would increase prizes and lead to investment in bingo halls, campaigners claim . The call for the Tories to do more to appeal to working class areas comes after criticism that David Cameron's inner-circle is still too elitist. An IpsosMori poll in September found 70 per cent of voters thought Mr Cameron was ‘out of touch’, a figure never reached by any Tory leader in the past 35 years. The Wythenshawe and Sale East by-election this month saw the Tories come third behind Ukip, leading Nigel Farage to claim his party is now the opposition to Labour in the north. Pauline Latham, the MP for Mid-Derbyshire, complained that Mr Cameron tends to surround himself with ‘people who are like him’. ‘I am sure he listens to Samantha Cameron a lot but he is never going to listen to me. Everything is looked at through the prism of London, by people from London. We should have regional input’.","Chancellor urged to cut bingo duty from 20% to 15% in line with betting .

The promotion, showing bare bottoms, screaming rows and foul language, has already been viewed more than 400,000 times. Scroll down for video . Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson told the Liverpool Echo he wouldn't expect the show to win any Oscars . The controversial programme's pilot episode is set to be broadcast in two weeks' time . Producers hope a pilot episode will be broadcast within two weeks, leading to a series. But more than 1,000 people have now signed a petition calling for producer Phenomenal Pictures to abandon plans to broadcast the series. Petition organiser Adam Manley said: ‘This show does not show the true Liverpool, just a very small minority of idiots who are trying to use it as a platform to become famous. ‘You are depicting Liverpool to be something that it is not. ‘You are destroying the image of our great city, that we've all worked hard to change for the better.’ The trailer for the show, uploaded on to YouTube this week, has been viewed more than 400,000 times .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 04:29 EST, 26 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 04:40 EST, 26 February 2014 . Tough new language checks for European doctors are to come into force from this summer. It comes as nine out of 10 patients and health workers backed the idea of striking off doctors who refuse to learn English. The . General Medical Council will also be able to force doctors from the . European Union to take language tests if there are concerns about their . ability to communicate with their patients. Doctors from the European Union will face new language tests to ensure patients are protected . Under existing rules, the GMC can only test the language skills of foreign doctors from outside the EU. Since 1983 it has been banned from testing the skills of those arriving from member states. There are more than 27,000 doctors from the EEA working in the UK, none of whom have ever been tested for their English skills. Under . a GMC consultation which has just closed,  there will be a new category . in fitness to practise cases in which a doctor can be found ‘impaired . because he or she does not have the necessary knowledge of English’. There will also be a new power to force . doctors to undergo an English language test if a ‘relevant, serious . complaint is made about them’. The . GMC will also have the power to ‘indefinitely suspend doctors who don’t . develop sufficient English language skills to treat patients safely’. Niall . Dickson, Chief Executive of the GMC, said: ‘Doctors who want to . practise in the UK must be able to communicate effectively in English to . ensure the safety of their patients. ‘These . new measures to ensure doctors from other European countries can . communicate in English, combined with the higher test score . requirements, will help us strengthen protection for patients. They will . also bring about a greater degree of fairness between our requirements . for European doctors and for those from outside Europe.’ Lethal dose: German Dr Daniel Ubani killed a patient after confusing two different drugs . In . 2008 German Dr Daniel Urbani killed Cambridge patient David Gray when . he confused two drugs and gave him 10 times the recommended dose of . diamorphine. Health minister Dan Poulter said: ‘Overseas doctors make a valuable contribution to the national health service. ‘However, . it is vital that all doctors practising in the United Kingdom have the . necessary language skills to help ensure patient safety and quality of . care.’ He insisted that . individual NHS organisations are responsible for ‘ensuring that the . people they employ have the required knowledge and skills, including . language competency, for the posts for which they are applying’. An alarming 66 cases were investigated by senior NHS staff in 2011 after patients complained that they had received poor treatment from doctors who had a poor grasp of the English language. In an attempt to tackle the problem, in September the Government proposed introducing language tests specifically for doctors arriving from EU countries in what would amount to a change to EU law. In a public consultation on the issue, nine out of 10 respondents agreed that the GMC should have the power to require a doctor to undergo a language assessment when there is a serious concern about their knowledge of English, and that the GMC should not grant a licence to practise to European doctors who are unable or unwilling to show they have the necessary knowledge of English. Eight out of 10 respondents felt that that the GMC should indefinitely suspend doctors who fail to acquire the necessary knowledge of English to treat patients in the UK safely. Under the Government's plans, the GMC would not be given the right to automatically test all EU doctors, but it would be able to carry out tests if concerns were raised when they registered to work. Inspectors can check competency when looking at qualifications, how long doctors have been registered in other countries and what experience they have. Red flags might include doctors turning up with interpreters, poor English in interviews or poor written English on application forms. Any worries could then prompt full testing of the doctor's language skills. The new plans would also allow the GMC to assess any doctor if language concerns arise during a fitness-to-practise investigation. At present, the GMC has no powers to carry out such checks during its hearings.","Doctors from overseas wanting .

A council is investigating why swastikas are carved into the stonework of its offices after a member of the public spotted the masonry 75 years after the building was built. A row of the infamous Nazi symbols adorn part of the stone façade above a door at Essex County Hall in Chelmsford, which was completed in 1939, the year the Second World War started. A member of the public wrote to the council asking why it 'was still commissioned given the symbol's negative connotations.' A county council has been asked to explain why the front of its HQ is decorated with swastikas . They added: 'It struck me as strange seeing as the Nazi party formed in 1933 and by March 1938 were beginning an invasion into Austria. 'It's potentially offensive and upsetting to those that lost loved ones in the war or those that fought for their country.' The council is dealing with the request for an explanation under the Freedom of Information Act. A spokesman said: 'We will be responding in detail to the individual who has raised the questions before making any further comment.' John Hammond of the Chelmsford Civic . Society questioned why the request for an explanation was being made 75 . years after the building was constructed. He said: 'I'm mystified as to why it's coming up now. Personally I think it would be overkill to remove the symbols.' A row of the infamous Nazi symbols are on the stone façade above a door at Essex County Hall in Chelmsford - completed in 1939, the year the Second World War started. A member of the public wrote to the council asking for an explanation . The swastika was used for thousands of years, including a Hindu symbol, before it was adopted by Hitler. The Grade II-listed building was constructed between 1929 to 1939 - the decade of the Nazis' rise to power. The hall 'strongly represents the civic pride and authority of a county council', according to English Heritage. In addition to the controversial swastika carvings, the exterior is decorated with Corinthian columns and other details. The building is particularly noted for its interior fixtures and fittings, including stained glass windows and murals by prominent local artists. The swastika is an ancient symbol whose history stretched back for millennia before its meaning was perverted by Nazi ideology. It is used to represent luck in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, and takes its name - meaning 'it is good' from the Sanskrit language in which the Hindu religious texts were written. Many Hindus traditionally painted the swastika symbol over their doors during festivals in order to welcome the gods inside. As well as Asian religions, the swastika has been a popular decorative motif in Greek, Roman, Celtic and Byzantine art, making it one of the most common symbols in human history. However, in 1920 Adolf Hitler declared that the swastika - tilted 45 degrees - should be the official logo of his nascent Nazi Party. When he came to power, he replaced the German flag with a swastika in a white circle on a red background, making the emblem a feared symbol of his murderous regime. After the Second World War the Nazi swastika was outlawed in Germany, Poland, Hungary and Lithuania, although it is still permitted in a religious or scholarly context.","Nazi symbols adorn part of stone façade above door at Essex County Hall .

Mystery: It’s unclear when Luis Rodriguez died. Police said three officers involved in the incident are on administrative leave . The video starts with five officers — two on-duty and three off-duty who were moonlighting as security at the movie theater— trying to restrain Rodriguez. Once they have him in handcuffs, a police officer comes over and starts talking to Nair Rodriguez about the incident.

A former City stockbroker serving nine years for a £27.5m 'boiler room' scam apologised for his scruffy attire in court, blaming his wife for burning all his clothes. Tomas Wilmot, 65, together with his sons Kevin, 44 and Christopher, 43, were jailed for a total of 19 years after cheating 1,700 vulnerable investors out of 'substantial' amounts of cash. The trio tricked their victims into buying worthless, non-existent shares while operating mainly in Spain, as well as from offices in Brazil, Belize, Dubai and a number of Caribbean islands. The scam was only discovered when searches carried out by officers examining a different boiler room fraud uncovered links to the Wilmots. Tomas Wilmot was jailed for a total of nine years in August 2011, but he returned to Southwark Crown Court for a three day confiscation hearing this week. The once hugely successful banker, who owned a string of homes and restaurants, revealed his turbulent relationship with his wife, Christine. Modestly dressed in a green and navy striped polo shirt, jeans and white trainers, the pensioner could not disguise the bitterness in his voice when he said: 'May I apologise for how I am dressed, the wife, well ex-wife, burned all my clothes. 'All my memories, everything in the past, was burned,' he added. 'I'm not happy about this. 'But I believe there was no value in those items.  If the FSA think there is, they can go and talk to her. 'If they get any sense out of her, it will be a bloody miracle.' Wilmot told how he had property repossessed and his family had struggled financially since his incarceration. Christopher, 43, (left) and Kevin, 44, cheated 1,700 vulnerable investors out of 'substantial' amounts of cash . 'From what I understand my wife and children are living with her mother because they have no money at all. 'If they had any other items they would have sold them. 'It's all very light hearted, the FSA and prosecution can put restraining orders on everything and somehow they will find hidden assets. 'We don't have hidden assets. My wife is working 70 to 80 hours a week. 'She and the children are living in cramped conditions with her mother. Her lifestyle is absolutely crap, it's appalling.' Wilmot said his wife informed him other high value items worth about £50,000, including artwork, had been stolen around 2012. 'We have had difficulties in our marriage since 2004, extreme difficulties. 'It doesn't suit the prosecution to hear this but its true. She isn't the easiest to deal with. 'I did tell her to report it (the stolen items) but she doesn't take any notice of what I say - she is too busy burning my clothes. 'She couldn't afford to put them in storage so I assume what she is telling me is true. He returned to Southwark Crown Court for a three day confiscation hearing this week . 'Her father's funeral expenses remain unpaid because she hasn't got the money for it.' Wilmot said of the whereabouts of a 'beautifully designed' piece of jewellery he once gave his significant other: 'You know, I have absolutely no idea, you would have to ask her new boyfriend.' Wilmot said he and his wife had yet to divorce, but added: 'That will happen in due course'. He revealed: 'Whenever I gave my wife any money she would use it to try and divorce me.' When questioned about his assets by prosecutor James Fletcher, Wilmot responded, without a hint of irony: 'I'm an honest man, I tell the truth. 'I find it really offensive to answer questions which suggest I'm lying.' Jailing Wilmot, Judge Anthony Leonard described the total amount obtained by the fraud as 'staggering'. 'I judge you to be at the very centre of this fraud and to have been responsible for the involvement of your sons.' Investigators unearthed tens of thousands of documents together with computer equipment during raids of the homes and offices of the three men in Guildford and Bramley, in Surrey, and Horsham, in West Sussex. During a four year period £27.5m was paid into five UK bank accounts and £14m was transferred out to off-shore accounts in Spain, Malta and Lithuania. Tomas Wilmot, of (Buckhurst), Westwood Lane, Normandy, Guildford, Surrey, was jailed for nine years after being convicted of four counts of conspiracy to defraud. Christopher Wilmot and Kevin Wilmot of Horsham, West Sussex, were each jailed for five years after being convicted of the same charges. A fourth man, Mark Dingley, of Bishop Stortford, Hertfordshire, who faced the same charges was cleared by the jury of any involvement in the scam. A judgement has yet to be made on the total sum Wilmot raked in and any available assets which can potentially be clawed back. The hearing continues.","Tomas Wilmot, 65, together with sons Kevin, 44 and Christopher, 43, were jailed for a total of 19 years after cheating 1,700 vulnerable investors out of 'substantial' amounts of cash .

The mother of a sick teenage girl caught in a year-long, custody battle with doctors collapsed on Monday after a judge decided the 15-year-old should be placed in foster care and not returned to her family. The decision to prolong Justina Pelletier's separation from her family caused her mother Linda to faint at the Boston courthouse. The 56-year-old, who is diabetic, was stretchered out and taken to Massachusetts General Hospital. Speaking from her Connecticut home today, Linda Pelletier told MailOnline that doctors said her blackout was caused by the high stress she has been suffering over her daughter's ordeal, which the mother described as 'evil'. Mrs Pelletier said: 'I ask my husband every day, ''Are they trying to kill her?''' Scroll down for video . Linda Pelletier was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital on Monday , accompanied by her daughter Jennifer, after she collapsed on finding out that her sick daughter Justina will remain in foster care . Desperate: Justina Pelletier, 15, pictured with her mom Linda, has now spent a year in a psychiatric ward after she was taken from her parents against their will on doctor's orders . Mrs Pelletier and husband Lou have been battling Boston Children's Hospital and the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families to regain custody of their once vibrant daughter Justina since February 2013. Justina . Pelletier was diagnosed with . Mitochondrial Disease, a rare genetic muscle-wasting illness, by Tufts . Medical Center in 2011 and was undergoing a drug treatment program. However last year, while being treated for flu at Boston's Children’s . Hospital, experts said she had Somatoform Disorder, a stress-related mental . illness where people 'imagine they are ill'. When the teen's parents contested the hospital's diagnosis and sought to have their daughter treated by her own doctor, officials reportedly refused and a short time later, the girl was taken into the custody of the state. The teenager was transferred to a residential psychiatric unit at the end of January 2013 and has remained there since. Mrs Pelletier, who has three other daughters and cares for her 93-year-old mother at West Hartford home, told MailOnline on Tuesday: 'I have had no medical updates about my child. She is deteriorating - she can't stand, sit, she has chronic pain. 'When I saw her on Friday, her stomach was distended, she didn't feel well. But nobody helps her.' Massachusetts Department of Children and Families said in a statement: 'The Department of Children and Families does not comment or provide any information regarding children in our custody. Additionally, the Court has maintained a gag order in this case, prohibiting any parties from discussing the case or details surrounding it.' Wayside Youth residential unit in Framingham where Miss Pelletier is currently being held was unable to comment on specific cases. Anguish: Justina Pelletier's mother Linda and sister Jennifer are rushed to a waiting ambulance after the 56-year-old collapsed following the judge's ruling that her daughter will be kept in foster care . Happy: The family maintain that Justina was healthy and contented before she was admitted to hospital a year ago. They said she was a keen ice-skater and loved hiking with her dog Roxie (right) The family is devastated that Justina is now scheduled to . be moved from a residential center in Framingham to Shore Educational . Collaborative which is even further from the family's home in West . Hartford, Connecticut and makes it more difficult to visit. Although . the judge's ruling is only temporary until the next court date on March 17, . it is another heartbreaking decision in an anguished year for the . Pelletier family. A gag order also remains in place over the custody proceedings until that time. Mrs Pelletier said on Tuesday that she has no faith in the justice system since her daughter was taken from her family, calling the court hearings a 'joke'. However the mother-of-four said her family was now being helped by several lawyers and organizations. She said: 'I'm so grateful, they have given me hope. I feel like God has finally listened.' Fears: Lou and Linda say Justina 'is barely recognizable as her health has deteriorated so badly' We miss you: Sitting on Justina's bed at her Connecticut home are her sisters: From left, Julia, Jennifer and Jessica. Jessica, far right, has been diagnosed as having the same Mitochondrial Disease that Justina was being treated for before she was 'kidnapped' after a visit to Boston Children's Hospital with a bout of the flu . Mr Pelletier told MailOnline last month that his daughter's health had declined drastically. He said: 'Her legs are paralyzed, she has no upper body strength and she is in constant pain because they have removed most of her medications. Justina Pelletier was diagnosed with . mitochondrial disease in 2011, a genetic condition that . affects muscle coordination and mobility. There is no cure for the condition that is progressive and can be fatal. Symptoms can include weakness, intolerance for exercise, heart failure, dementia and rhythm disturbances. Each year, 1,000-4,000 children in the U.S. are born with the disease. However last year doctors concluded Miss Pellietier was suffering from Somafotorm disorder, a . psychological condition that causes sufferers to feel pain, although . there is no physical cause for it. Sufferers do not feign the physical symptoms they feel, rather they present themselves as the result of mental strain. Doctors cannot identify the sources of patients' pain and instead prescribe anti-depressants. Experts . estimate that between 0.2 and 2 per cent of females and less than 0.2. per cent of men in the US suffer from the condition. 'She suffered a stroke when she was seven and it affected her short-term memory. She is considered learning disabled, yet she has had no education in the last year. 'Justina did manage to sneak a few notes out of the hospital but she can’t do that anymore. She has forgotten how to write and spell. 'From what we can gather, she spends 24 hours a day lying in a room. It is a locked psychiatric unit full of children with major psychiatric problems. 'Justina doesn’t have psychiatric problems, she is ill and she needs proper medical care. Once a week she is taken on a three-hour round trip to see doctors but that is it. 'We are only allowed to see her for one hour a week at a Department of Children and Families office. Health aside, she is a mess. 'She’s in a wheelchair yet she is . getting no help with showering or grooming. When we saw her last it was . 20 degrees outside and her hair was wet.' Boston Children's Hospital have rarely commented on the case, but in a statement to MailOnline they said they were 'proud' of their work and the 'positive impact on the patient'. The hospital did not address the family's specific allegations. Boston Children’s Hospital said in a statement: 'Boston Children’s would like to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of our staff in caring for this patient. We are proud of their work and positive impact on the patient. 'Boston Children’s and our clinicians are particularly distressed that the inaccuracies surrounding this case have caused undo concern for the many children and their families with Mitochondrial Disorders in our care.'","Judge ruled on Monday that Justina Pelletier, 15, to be placed in foster care after being locked in a psychiatric ward a year ago against family's wishes .

Former Casualty star Clive Mantle has admitted he is ‘utterly shellshocked’ after two men he called Rab C Nesbitt-type Scots were cleared of an attack in which a chunk of his ear was gnawed off. Philip McGilvray, 33, admitted biting the 6ft 5in actor’s ear after they clashed in a Newcastle hotel corridor in a late night row over noise last March, but claimed self-defence. He and his friend Alan French, 32, were cleared of grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent and the lesser charge of GBH after a jury at Newcastle Crown Court deliberated for almost five hours. Trial: Former Casualty actor Clive Mantle said he is 'utterly shellshocked' after Philip McGilvray, right, and his friend Alan French were cleared of GBH despite one biting part of his ear off . The court heard how Mr French and Mr . McGilvray, both of Hamilton, Lanarkshire, had been in the city for a . weekend with friends and had been drinking heavily since earlier in the . morning. Mr McGilvray, his . friends and Mr Mantle were all staying in the same Travelodge on . Newcastle’s Quayside where the incident happened.

The . court heard how Mr French and Mr McGilvray had been in the corridor . making a lot of noise when Mr Mantle, 56, came out to ask them to . quieten down on March 24 last year. There . was then a scuffle in which Mr Mantle – who has starred in the hit TV . show Game of Thrones – allegedly ran at the pair and they ended up . locked in a fight. The court heard Mr Mantle was on top of Mr McGilvray, who called him a 'big monster' and feared 'he was trying to kill me' So he admitted biting a part of Mr Mantle's ear off. It was put in a glass of water to preserve it, but that compromised the tissue and it could not be re-attached. Neither of the acquitted men wanted to comment as they walked out of court with family members yesterday. But . Mr Mantle issued a statement  in which he said: ‘I am utterly . shellshocked by the verdict of the court, and have lost a great deal of . faith in a process which can deliver such an injustice. ‘As . much as I am hurt and baffled by the decision, I am more worried at the . message it gives out to law-abiding people who dare to point out the . terrible behaviour of  others.

A retired caretaker who rides a mobility scooter customised to look like a Harley Davidson has told how he is repeatedly pulled over by police - for riding a motorcycle on the pavement. Geoff Dickson, a 64-year-old from Wells in Somerset, says he is fed-up with officers mistaking his £6,000 electric scooter for the on-the-road version it had been designed to look like. Nicknamed 'The Wells Angel' by his neighbours, Mr Dickson says his three-wheeled vehicle is fully legal to ride on the pavement as it is limited to a top speed of just four miles per hour. Young at heart: Geoff Dickson, 64, says he is fed-up with officers mistaking his £6,000 customised electric scooter for a Harley Davidson motorcycle as he rides around the streets of Wells in Somerset . Customised: The eccentric vehicle, which cost £6,000, has been set to a top speed of just four miles per hour, which means Mr Dickson is regularly overtaken by 'little old ladies' with their machines on 'road mode' Mr Dickson says he is repeatedly pulled over for potentially breaking the law by riding on the pavement and has even been tracked down in cafes after parking his machine outside. The father-of-three says officers soon back down when they take a closer look at his eccentric vehicle, however. Describing the customised machine, Mr Dickson says: 'I was told I had to get a mobility scooter so I went to a local store, but all I saw were pink things with baskets on the front - I really wasn't impressed.' 'The woman in the shop asked me what I would be interested in so I told her I wanted something that would go off-road and that looked like a Harley Davidson.' 'Just because you are old and disabled doesn't mean you can't be cool too... They hunted around and showed me the one they had found.' 'Some people call me 'The Wells Angel' and that's fine - it's only rock n' roll but I like it.' Mr Dickson got the scooter last summer after he was diagnosed with HSP - a condition that kills his nerves and has left him unable to control his legs. But he was horrified by the thought of getting an 'old fashioned' scooter designed for pensioners and approached his local retailer to ask if they could source something different. Night rider: Nicknamed 'The Wells Angel' by his neighbours, Mr Dickson says his three-wheeled vehicle is fully legal to ride on the pavement as it is has a top speed of just four miles per hour . Getting around: Mr Dickson says he is repeatedly pulled over for potentially breaking the law by riding on the pavement and has even been tracked down in cafes after parking his machine outside . Comparison: Police officers in Wells have repeatedly mistaken Geoff Dickson's mobility scooter for a road-going Harley Davidson motorcycle (pictured) The Sport Rider model he purchased features chrome-style forks and handlebars and a large central headlight like a motorbike. His unusual mode of transport quickly attracted the attention of the local police, however. He said: 'I was driving along the pavement when a police car drove past me then quickly spun around and pulled over.' 'When they got out the car one of them was nudging the other and they were laughing... One of them said 'sorry, brains over here thought you were riding a motorbike on the pavement'. Afterwards they just kept pushing each other and laughing,' he added. Although police in Somerset repeatedly mistake Geoff Dickson's mobility scooter for a Harley Davidson, the only real comparison between the two vehicles is their appearance. While the Harley can comfortably reach a top speed of 110mph, Mr Dickson's scooter is limited to just 4mph in order to make it legal to drive on the pavement. It is, however, capable of reaching 8mph if its engine is switched from 'street mode' to 'road mode'. Mr Dickson says this is the setting many 'little old ladies' in the town of Wells are using when they speed past his customised scooter. The Sport Rider vehicle is powered by a 100ah 12V x 2 battery which last for between 30 and 32 hours of continuous riding between charges. The 'Fat Boy', on the other hand, has a classic air-cooled, six-speed engine which sits on the outside of the bike and helps make it instantly recognisable as a Harley Davidson. When it comes to braking ability, a Harley Davidson 'Fat Bay' uses four-piston front brakes and two-piston rear brakes which allow it to reduce speed safely and comfortably. Although Mr Dickson's Sport Rider comes to an equally luxurious halt, it needs only a small electromagnetic brake to slow down, with much of the speed control influenced by the opening and closing of the throttle. Finally there is a huge difference in price between the two vehicles, with a brand new Harley Davidson 'Fat Boy'  costing a minimum £15,995. The Sport Rider, meanwhile, can be bought for as little as £3,500 if you aren't interested in additional customisation work. Not tearing up the neighbourhood: Mr Dickson said that a police officer once came up to him while he was drinking coffee in a cafe and asked to take a photo of the vehicle . Easy mistake: Geoff Dickson says police who repeatedly mistake his scooter for a Harley Davidson soon back down when they take a closer look . Describing why he purchased the customised machine, Mr Dickson said: 'I was told I had to get a mobility scooter so I went to a local store, but all I saw were pink things with baskets on the front - I wasn't impressed' Mr Dickson said that on another occasion a different police officer came up to him while he was drinking coffee in a cafe as he had left the vehicle parked outside. 'He was going to tell me off for parking on the pavement but then he realised his mistake and asked if they could take a picture of it instead,' Mr Dickson said. Mr Dickson says he has now become something of a local celebrity and has even earned his own nickname. He said: 'People around here think it's great - they all call me the 'Wells Angel' - people are always stopping me and asking for a picture.' 'Having this mobility scooter has really changed my life, I was so against the idea of amobility scooter at first and now they can't get me off it,' he added. 'I've got my speed set to four miles per hour which is walking speed, so quite often little old ladies who have left 'road mode' on come speeding right past me in their pink scooters with baskets - it's very funny.' Mr Dickson's vehicle can theoretically reach eight miles per hour but has had its top speed limited. He says his vehicle is battery powered and can go about 32 miles on a single charge, allowing him to visit the nearby Somerset Levels to take photographs. 'It has really given me my mobility back - I wouldn't be able to get anywhere without it now,' he said. Mr Dickson says that, as well as making him feel cool, his choice in mobility scooter had made others feel better about using them. He said: 'There is a young lad down the road who for some reason or another needed a mobility scooter... He really didn't like the idea but then he saw mine and he couldn't wait to get one.' 'If you're still young at heart and you need a mobility scooter then you should get one likethis,' he added.","Geoff Dickson, 64, says he is tired of being pulled over by police officers .

Ambition: Unite leader Len McCluskey told Newsnight he feels union influence on Labour is imperative . Ed Miliband's controversial reform of Labour's structures will allow the unions to tighten their grip on the party, Len McCluskey boasted last night. Mr McCluskey, militant boss of the giant Unite union, said he 'certainly' expected to emerge with more power from a set of reforms that are meant to convince voters that Labour is not simply doing the bidding of its union paymasters. Mr Miliband pledged to shake up Labour's links with the unions last year in the wake of the Falkirk vote-rigging scandal, when Unite was accused of trying to fix the selection of a new candidate for the safe Labour seat. A watered-down package of reforms is set to be rubber-stamped by party chiefs at a special conference this weekend, although they will not be phased in programme fully for five years. But Mr McCluskey told the BBC's Newsnight that he expected the reforms to give the unions 'more influence' in the running of the party than they have already. Asked if Unite could emerge with more power, he said: 'We certainly could, if we work hard enough, and Unite intends to, we intend to go out and persuade our members actively to a whole host of different mediums to join the Labour Party... because of course we believe that in recent years the party has lost the values that trades unionists bring to the party and we want to have more influence in the party.' He said it was now 'central to Unite's political strategy' to persuade activists to sign up for a new category of 'affiliate' membership of Labour, which will give them full voting rights on a par with MPs in leadership elections. The intervention is deeply unhelpful for Mr Miliband, who has repeatedly denied Tory claims that his reforms are a sham that will increase the influence of the unions rather than curb it. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps last night seized on Mr McCluskey's comments as evidence that the reforms would have little more than a cosmetic impact. 'The unions still dictate Labour's policy, push the leader around and choose the candidates,' Mr Shapps said. 'Ed Miliband is too weak to stand up to his union paymasters and therefore will never be able to stand up for the hardworking people of Britain.' His words come as Labour party leaders, such as Miliband and Harman, intend to show their distance . Concerns: McCluskey said he feels talk of a Lib/Lab coalition shows the party is losing its roots . In a further flexing of muscles, Mr McCluskey also warned Mr Miliband to rule out a post-election coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Mr McCluskey, whose union is Labour's biggest donor, said: 'One of the things that people are looking for is something different and I'm afraid that the reason why politicians are not particularly popular at the moment is people don't see any differences so I think they're looking for people who have courage of their convictions. 'Labour, I hope, win the next election outright, but if they are the biggest party then my view is Ed should have the courage of his convictions and govern on a minority government. 'The real test comes in 2015 when the British people have chosen, and my advice, my view is that Ed shouldn't be sucked into a Lib/Lab pact, he should have the courage of his convictions if we are the largest party, he should govern. 'And he should challenge those coalition parties to bring him down if necessary and go back to the people so that there's a stark alternative.' His comments come amid reports that David Cameron is preparing to rule out a future coalition with Nick Clegg.","Unite leader Len McCluskey says reforms will give unions more influence .

National Parks will be exempt from plans to allow developers to convert old buildings into barn conversions and homes. Ministers had proposed plans to make it easier for property developers to convert agricultural buildings into houses in protected areas. The measures, which had been strongly criticised by campaigners, would have allowed disused farm properties to be turned into a maximum of three homes - without needing permission. The measures, which had been strongly criticised by campaigners, would have allowed disused farm properties to be turned into a maximum of three homes on parks such as Exmoor . Ministers has proposed plans to make it easier for property developers to convert agricultural buildings into houses in protected areas including the Lake District . Developers would not have needed to apply and would have been automatically granted the right to build on the national parks, under plans to generate housing. But now national parks, long protected as areas of outstanding natural beauty and conservation areas will be exempt from the new rules, The Daily Telegraph reported. Instead, ministers will now release guidance designed to encourage national parks into accepting barn conversions. Back in October the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) said that more than 30 formerly protected areas are being considered or approved for large scale housing projects or developments which could leave a permanent scar on the countryside. Developers would not have needed to apply to build homes on areas  of outstanding beauty . They warned that the National Parks under threat are the South Downs (pictured), the Yorkshire Dales, Dartmoor and the Lake District . More than ten National Parks faced being blighted by construction schemes, while designated Areas of Outstanding Natural beauty (AONB) across home counties such as Kent, Essex and Sussex were also at risk, campaigners warned. They warned that the national parks under threat are the South Downs, the Yorkshire Dales, Dartmoor and the Lake District. Applications to build on â€˜so-called protected areasâ€™ have increased rapidly since the Government reformed planning rules in March 2012, making it easier for developers to get permission to build. Totnes Conservative MP Dr Sarah Wollaston warned the Commons that she believes the building proposals could result in overpriced second homes being built, instead of affordable homes desperately needed to help people climb on to the property ladder, the Western Daily Press reported. Dr Wollaston said there are potentially 4,000 properties which could each be converted into up to three homes on Dartmoor, . She stressed that it was crucial to keep farming in the national park in order to protect it.","National Parks will be exempt from plans to allow developers to convert old buildings into barn conversions and homes .

Strange noises: Maintenance worker Carlos Michel discovered the baby after hearing what sounded like a cat mewing coming from the dumpster . Sad discovery: The baby was found stuffed in a trash bag among food containers, scraps and school homework . Inside a white trash bag along with food containers, scraps and school homework, Michel found a 7-8 pound baby boy with four inches of its umbilical cord still attached. Michel and another man took the baby to a nearby car to keep it warm while they waited for police and paramedics to arrive. The boy was found purple and having a hard time breathing but appears to be doing well now at Memorial Hermann Hospital. The police have since identified the mother as a 16-year-old who attends South Houston High School. She is currently under examination at the same hospital where her baby is being cared for. Once released she will be questioned by police, who will then decide whether to bring up charges. Other residents in the apartment early speculated on who the mother was.

Unwitting: Georgina Baillie was caught up in a prank call to her grandfather Andrew Sachs made by Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross . The family of Andrew Sachs have urged him to mend his relationship with his granddaughter after the ‘Sachsgate’ affair more than five years ago. Georgina Baillie was unwittingly caught up in a prank call to Mr Sachs made by Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross, in which Brand said on-air that he had slept with her. The Radio 2 presenters left a series of obscene messages on the Fawlty Towers actor’s answer machine during a late-night show in October 2008. It later emerged former private school girl Miss Baillie, now 28, was a burlesque dancer in a group called Satanic Sluts. Sachs, who has hardly spoken to his granddaughter since, said only this week: ‘We don’t talk to Georgina. It was so disgusting what she was doing.’ Her father Charles Baillie has urged Sachs, 83, and his wife Melody, 81, to see their oldest grandchild. In a letter to The Times, he disputed Sachs’s suggestion – in an interview to promote his autobiography – that she ‘had made no efforts’ to see them. Mr Baillie, 62, wrote: ‘Georgina has tried regularly to get back in touch over the past six years and her efforts were always rejected – except once, a year ago. We hope that they will remember that she was forgiven, invited back into the fold and was invited to Grandma’s 80th birthday party at The Ivy and then uninvited a few days before the event. ‘All I can pray for is that Granddad and Grandma Sachs will call Georgina, accept her apologies and resume normal relations. They are so loved and missed, and all are poorer for not being in each others’ lives.’ Mr Baillie, a former principal at the National Theatre, is divorced from Sachs’s daughter Kate, 53, but said both he and his ex-wife worry about the effect the prank had on the elderly couple. Last night, Mrs Sachs said neither she nor her husband had any plan of being reunited with Miss Baillie, and told Mr Baillie, whom they have not seen for a decade, to ‘mind his own business’. From their five-bedroom Hampstead home, she said: ‘I don’t want to speak to Georgie, I don’t really want to be friendly with Georgie, I don’t want a relationship with Georgie. Hurt: Andrew and Melody Sachs have hardly spoken to their granddaughter since, and say they have no plans to be reunited with her . ‘The only reason Brand knew who her grandfather was is because she told him when they were watching television together and he came on to the screen. If she hadn’t told him this would never have happened.’ She said their relationship was difficult in the year before Sachsgate, but broke down totally afterwards. The couple were upset that Miss Baillie worked with celebrity publicist Max Clifford and sold her story, including details of her sex life with Brand, to a tabloid. In that piece, Miss Baillie said Brand ‘seemed obsessed by the idea that he was close to Manuel’s granddaughter’ and complained he was ‘a disappointment in the bedroom considering he has had so much practice’. Crude: Brand and Ross making the joke call . Prank: The Radio 2 presenters left a series of obscene messages on the Fawlty Towers actor¿s answer machine during a late-night show in October 2008 . Outrage: The incident provoked 42,000 complaints and Brand later resigned, while Ross was suspended . Mrs Sachs said: ‘She went to Max Clifford and, then of course, did quite well out of it in magazines and newspapers. ‘She must have made a lot of money out of it. It kept it all going for a long time. It would have been better had she just kept quiet after it. ‘We absolutely adored her. We paid for her to go to the best school [£15,000-a-year Queen’s Gate School, Kensington].’ Asked what changed, she will only say: ‘There is a long history, but I don’t want to make things worse.’ Miss Baillie recently toured as a singer with Eighties pop star Adam Ant, 59, before quitting to study acting. Unhappy: Mr Sachs and his wife were upset that Miss Baillie worked with celebrity publicist Max Clifford and sold her story, including details of her sex life with Brand, to a tabloid . Speaking out: Sachs, who played Manuel in the BBC sitcom Fawlty Towers with John Cleese (left), has been promoting his autobiography, I Know Nothing . Her grandmother said she was tempted to patch things up in February last year, at her own 80th birthday party, but changed her mind at the last minute. She said: ‘There was a time when I thought about reconciling with Georgie for her mother’s sake. ‘But then I saw Brand on television [when he appeared on The Jonathan Ross show] and I thought, ‘Oh my God, what am I doing? . . . I don’t want the aggravation, I can’t cope with it.’ Sachs, who played Manuel in the BBC sitcom Fawlty Towers with John Cleese, has been promoting his autobiography, I Know Nothing. Speaking to The Times, he said of his granddaughter: ‘Yes it’s sad. I hate it. I hate it. But she’s made no efforts as far as I know.’ It was this that prompted Mr Baillie to write publicly to Mr Sachs. In the prank, Ross crudely told Sachs: ‘He f***** your granddaughter’, while Brand responded, ‘I did not do nothing with Georgina – oh no, I’ve revealed I know her name.’ The incident provoked 42,000 complaints and Brand later resigned, while Ross was suspended.","Georgina Baillie was caught up in phone call made to Andrew Sachs .

The 52-year-old woman was working on an Asda fish counter in Accrington town centre, Lancashire, when the teenager approached her stall and asked about what was for sale. Without warning the girl picked up a bream which was on ice and used it to assault the shocked worker before running out of the store. Scroll down for video . Assault and vinegar: Police want to speak to these two people, seen in CCTV images, after a 52-year-old Asda fish counter employee was slapped in the face with a large wet bream in Accrington, Lancashire . Battering: Police are classing the incident at this branch of Asda in Accrington, Lancashire, as an assault . It is believed a teenage boy was filming the incident on his phone and also fled the shop when he was challenged. Police described the prank as 'completely unacceptable' and have issued CCTV images of two suspects. The incident happened at about 3pm on Tuesday, February 4 and officers have asked for anyone who knows those in the images to come forward. The girl is described as having an Irish accent . and aged between 15 and 18 with blonde, shoulder-length untidy hair. She . was wearing dark jeans and a blue coat with white cuffs, white on the . front and a red collar with â€˜I love PBâ€™ on the left breast pocket. Fishing for clues: The woman was hit in the face with a bream, which can grow to 40cm long (file photo) The man is described as being around the same age, 5ft 8in and wearing a dark coat and dark grey trousers and boots. PC Graham Hartley said: 'This behaviour is completely unacceptable and I would appeal to anybody that witnessed this incident or recognises either the man or the woman pictured in the CCTV images to come forward and contact me, PC 1183 Hartley on 101.' The incident is an odd echo of sketches by Monty Python's Flying Circus - one of which featured a man in military uniform dancing on a canal towpath while slapping another man with a fish. His fun is brought to an abrupt halt when the second man pulls out an enormous specimen and uses it to hit his aggressor around the head, knocking him into the water. No laughing matter: The incident is reminiscent of the fish slapping dance in a sketch by Monty Python . The incident also has more serious echoes of 'happy slapping', a craze which took hold for a few years in the early 2000s when mobile phones were first equipped with video cameras. Mostly performed by teenagers, the pranks involved slapping or hitting someone while being filmed and then uploading the footage to the internet. Some took the prank too far and in 2008 a 15-year-old girl, who was too young to be named, was sentenced to a two-year detention and training order after filming an attack on 29-year-old victim Gavin Waterhouse, who later died.

Bad teacher: The mistakes in the Social Science textbook used in Gujarat state include placing Pakistan's capital in the Hindu Kush Mountains and confusing carbon dioxide with CO3 . The Social Science English medium textbook for Standard 8 published by the Gujarat Council of Educational Research and Training (GCERT) has come under severe criticism, and it is not exactly uncalled for. The 124-page book has 59 factual errors and more than 100 spelling mistakes, according to the Times of India. Among a long list of errors, the schoolchildren of Gujarat, a state which borders Pakistan, are taught that the Muslim country which won independence in 1947 was called ‘Islamic Islamabad’. It also states that the capital of Pakistan, or ‘Islamic Islamabad’, is located in the Khyber pass in the Hindu Kush mountain range on the border to Afghanistan. False claims: The textbook for Year 8 claims that Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated in October 1948, instead of the true date of his death, 30th January that year .

Hundreds of seabirds have been washed up along the south-west coast after dying of exhaustion in the recent storms. The bodies of almost 500 birds, mostly guillemots and razorbills, have been recovered from the beaches of Cornwall, Devon and Dorset after they perished at sea. Experts at the Dorset Wildlife Trust said consistent gale-force storms in the English Channel during the past month had made it very hard for the creatures to hunt and feed. Devastated: The bodies of almost 500 birds, mostly guillemots - like the one pictured in this stock image - and razorbills, have been recovered from the beaches of Cornwall, Devon and Dorset after they perished at sea . The malnutrition coupled with flying in ferocious winds meant they became exhausted and died. Birds fared even worse across the Channel, where 15,000 puffins were found dead on the shores of France. The French League for the Protection of Birds said the tragedy could have a devastating effect on the coming breeding season. The majority of the dead birds have washed up at sheltered Chesil Cove in Dorset, having being swept across Lyme Bay by south westerly winds. Some conservationists have claimed the birds have been killed by a pollutant similar to palm oil but this has been ruled out by the Dorset Wildlife Trust (DWT). Mark Smith, of the DWT, said: 'We have probably had 600 birds washed up along the south west coast over the last few days. 'Of these about 130 have been found alive and taken to an RSPCA centre. 'We have had a few puffins but most of the birds have been guillemots and a few razorbills. 'About 300 of them have been found on Chesil Beach. Portland sticks out in the Channel like a giant hand which grabs anything blown from the south west. 'We are putting the deaths down to sheer exhaustion brought about by the adverse weather conditions. 'These birds were exhausted, under weight and suffering from malnutrition as they haven't been able to feed or hunt. 'About 20 per cent of them have had a dark oiling on them but it is impossible to say of this was before or after death. 'It is a similar substance that was around six weeks ago which turned out to be a non-toxic waxy substance that wasn't palm oil. 'In France and the Channel Islands there have been over 11,000 puffins that have washed up dead and none of them were covered in any oil.' Exhaustion: The majority of the dead birds have washed up at sheltered Chesil Cove in Dorset, having being swept across Lyme Bay by south westerly winds. (Stock image) Mr Smith said the birds could have died at any time in the last two weeks and were now being washed ashore. Lumps of a waxy, white substance have also been discovered along the beaches. Conservationist Steve Trewhella is attempting to get the mystery pollution analysed to find out what it is and where it came from. He said: 'There are hundreds of large lumps of what I believe may be palm or vegetable oil all over the beach. 'It is rancid, very smelly and without doubt a risk to humans, pets and any wildlife that may encounter it. 'Warning signs should have been put up alerting people to this pollution.'","Storms over the past month have made it hard for birds to hunt and feed .

Manuela Sykes - a former Labour politician at Westminster City Council - can return home on a one-month trial basis . An 89-year-old who suffers from dementia has won a court fight to return to the flat where she has lived for 60 years because she is 'miserable' in a care home. A Court of Protection judge has ruled that Manuela Sykes - a former Labour politician at Westminster City Council, stood for Parliament, edited a trade union newspaper for 40 years and campaigned for better treatment for dementia sufferers - can return home on a one-month trial basis. District Judge Anselm Eldergill also ruled that Ms Sykes could be named in media reports - in line with her wishes and after journalists argued that identification would be in the public interest. Lawyers representing the pensioner said the judge's decision to allow identification was 'rare'. Detail of Judge Eldergill's decision has emerged in a written ruling following a Court of Protection hearing in London. Court of Protection judges analyse cases involving vulnerable and sick people. Hearings are often held in private and people involved are not normally identified because of their vulnerability. Judge Eldergill concluded that a one-month trial of home-based care would be in Ms Sykes' best interests - even though social workers from her local authority, Westminster City Council, had raised concerns about her welfare if she left a care home. The judge said if a trial was not attempted she would never again have the chance to live in her own home. And he said all viable alternatives should be explored before a conclusion could be reached that it was in Ms Sykes' best interests to spend the rest of her life in a care home. Westminster City Council, where Manuela Sykes served as a Labour councillor. She has won her fight to return to her flat because she is 'miserable' in a care home . Judge Eldergill said his decision to lift the 'usual veil of anonymity' had been 'finely balanced'. But he said the case was 'relatively unusual' and Ms Sykes' personality was a critical factor. He said she had always 'wished to be heard', would want her life to end with a 'bang not a whimper' and had a 'last chance to exert a political influence'. Manuela Sykes in her Women's Royal Naval Service uniform during the Second World War . He also said 'archival photographs' of Ms Sykes could be published - although not a current picture. Anne-Marie Irwin - a specialist Court of Protection solicitor from law firm Irwin Mitchell, who had represented pensioner's interests during litigation - said Ms Sykes had been a 'leading dementia campaigner' who now suffered with the illness and was 'miserable' in a care home. 'Manuela is firmly of the view that with the right kind of care package, she could be supported to return home safely,' she said. 'Although the kindness of her carers was praised, Manuela was miserable at the care home, and we asked the court to consider if it is truly in her best interests to remain deprived of her liberty. 'The court was asked on her behalf - what is the point of being kept safe, when to do so is also making you miserable?' She added: 'We are confident that with specialist dementia carers Ms Sykes can greatly benefit from returning to her own home.' Ms Sykes was born in Mexico to parents who met in the United States, according to an interview with the Trebus project - a website that documents the life stories of people suffering from dementia, all of which can be read or listened to on their website. During the Second World War Ms Sykes worked in the Women's Royal Naval Service, known as the Wren's, as a direction officer, allowing aircraft to land and take off from an aircraft carrier. Her mother also suffered from dementia, with Ms Sykes telling the website she had 'given her a terribly hard time' over it. Her hope in speaking to the Trebus project was that people could learn more about what living with dementia was actually like and to improve public understanding of the illness. In May 2011 her dementia story was read by Welsh actress Sian Phillips for a Radio 4 series called Ancient Mysteries produced by Charlie Higson and Paul Whitehouse.","Manuela Sykes - a former Labour politician at Westminster City Council - can return home on a one-month trial basis .

Vocal apartheid critic: Swedish Prime Minister Olaf Palme, who was gunned down in a central Stockholm street as walked along with his wife . The records of the Swedish author of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo have added a new twist to his country's greatest unsolved murder mystery. It has emerged that Stieg Larsson sent police 15 boxes of papers he believed linked Prime Minister Olaf Palme's murder to his opposition to the racist apartheid regime in South Africa. The novelist believed that the huge tranche of documents linked Palme's death to a Swedish former military officer allegedly connected with South African security services. Books by Larsson, who died of a heart attack in 2004, have sold more than 75million copies in 50 countries. The latest report has made headlines across Sweden, where, just like the Kennedy assassination, Palme's killing has spawned a legion of conspiracy theories. Palme was gunned down as he walked along a street in central Stockholm late on February 28, 1986, after going to the cinema with his wife. A petty criminal was found guilty of the killing in 1989, but was freed on appeal that same year - an outcome that led to widespread criticism of the police for bungling the investigation. The man Larsson suspected of being the assassin, Swedish secret service agent Bertil Wedin, denied the accusation. 'I have nothing to lose from the truth being established since I am luckily not the murderer,' he told Sweden's Svenska Dagbladet newspaper, which broke the story today. Deputy Prosecutor-General Kerstin Skarp, who leads the continuing police inquiry into the killing, told the newspaper that Wedin 'is not someone that we are pursuing with any intensity at the moment'. Hollywood: Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander in the American movie version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo . Wedin's name is not new to the investigation and emerged previously in the Nineties amid intense media speculation that there was a South African connection to the murder. The killing spawned legions of private investigations, including Larsson's. There were so many probes by ordinary Swedes that a name was even coined for them - 'privatspanare', or private scouts. Some claimed to have cracked the case with theories ranging from his death being a carefully enacted suicide to the work of foreign spy agencies. Private investigators have pointed the finger at an array of suspects, from Sweden's own security services to Kurdish separatists and the South African and Yugoslav secret police. Blockbuster: Stieg Larsson's novels, foremost among them The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, have sold 75million copies in more than 50 countries across the world. Larsson, right, died of a heart attack in 2004 . Palme, Social Democrat prime minister between 1969 and 1976 and again between 1982 and 1986, was hated by conservatives at home and abroad for his anti-colonial views and criticism of the U.S. Some even accused him of being a spy for the KGB. 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo', the . first in Larsson's 'The Millennium Trilogy', was made into a Hollywood . film with Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara in 2011. Its two sequels 'The Girl Who Played with Fire' and 'The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets' Nest', were also global bestsellers .","Olaf Palme was gunned down in a central Stockholm street in 1986 .

A mother-of-four has been jailed for six months for swindling taxpayers out of more than £53,000 in benefits and paying back just £600. Julie Bradshaw, 38, fraudulently claimed £53,482 in handouts over an eight-year period. After honestly applying for benefits in 1999, Bradshaw failed to reveal she was no longer entitled to the financial support when her partner moved in with her in 2003. Bradshaw started making honest claims for income support in 1999 and the following year began to claim for housing and council tax benefits. But in 2003, the 38-year-old failed to disclose to Stoke-on-Trent City Council that her partner had moved in. Instead, the mother-of-four continued to take the handouts. Judge Paul Glenn sentencing Bradshaw at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court jailed her, after hearing she has repaid just £600 of the money she stole - 1.12 per cent of what she owes. Judge Glenn told Bradshaw: 'You had three children with your partner who was in full-time employment. 'You knew full well that you had a duty to report changes in circumstances which might affect your entitlement to benefits. 'But you continued to claim because you had plainly become accustomed to the additional income that the benefits provided.' In an interview, Bradshaw told investigators at the Department for Work and Pensions, that her partner is the father of her three youngest children and a father figure to her eldest. At first she denied he lived with her, telling them he only stayed at weekends.' But it emerged that in 2011, he bought a house near to her home and she was living with him there. In total Bradshaw was £26,939 in extra income support, £21,691 in housing benefit and £4,851 in council tax benefit. Bradshaw, of Tunstall in . Staffordshire, admitted two charges of dishonestly failing to give . prompt notification of a change of circumstances affecting her . entitlement to benefits between September 2003 and July 2011. She . pleaded guilty on the basis that their relationship was volatile, her . partner would often live elsewhere and she might have qualified for some . benefits. Judge Paul Glenn jailed the mother-of-four for six months after hearing she has only paid back £600 of the thousands she owes . Robert Smith, defending, said one of Bradshaw’s sons has special needs and she is his primary carer. Stoke-on-Trent City Council - which operates its Spot the Cheater campaign - expects to recover around £1.2 million in wrongly-claimed benefits this financial year. More than 1,100 calls to report fraudsters have been made since April last year ~ with 297 relating to people who claim they are living alone. City Councillor Terry Crowe, cabinet member for finance, said: 'Benefits are there to support those genuinely in need. 'People abusing the system are illegally taking money from the public purse - effectively stealing from neighbours, friends, and family.'","Julie Bradshaw dishonestly claimed £53,482 in benefits over eight years .

Two New York police sources have said they would not miss Alec Baldwin should he move to Los Angeles . New York police sources have reportedly said Alec Baldwin will not be missed should he move to Los Angeles. The actor revealed yesterday in New York magazine that he ‘probably’ needs to move out of the city and said he was considering L.A. Baldwin said he misses the days when New Yorkers would signal their appreciation of celebrities briefly and politely while taking care to maintain privacy. An NYPD police officer responded however . by telling The New York Post: ‘I say: Don’t let the door hit you on the . way out of the city.’ The officer, who has not been named, reportedly knows Baldwin from the actor’s neighbourhood, Greenwich Village. ‘I . don’t like the guy. It’s a pain in the ass to deal with him every time . he blows his top at the press and we’re called in to clean up the mess.’ The source said that Mr Baldwin shows ‘respect’ to police officers, but said he wasn’t sure if it was ‘sincere’ or not. Another police source also told the paper: ‘Good riddance.’ They also said that his life would not get any better if he moves to L.A., pointing out that the press would 'hound' him there as well. In . the New York interview, headlined 'I Give Up', he talks about beginning to ‘crave’ Los Angeles . after more than 30 years in the Big Apple because he thinks he would be able . to give wife Hilaria and their six-month-old daughter Carmen a more . peaceful and private life. 'I give up': Melodramatic Alec Baldwin laments his A-list life as he predicts he will 'probably' have to leave New York in candid new interview . Revealing: The interview is said to detail the former 30 Rock star's feud with fellow actor Shia LaBeouf and the dispute with MSNBC that ended his short-lived Up Late talk show . In the same interview, Mr Baldwin also claims Shia LaBeouf verbally attacked him while making Orphans, leading to their bust-up. The . 55-year-old star and Mr LaBeouf were engulfed in a feud after clashing while . making the Broadway play partly because he claims the Transformers actor . 'began to sulk' because Mr Baldwin didn't learn his lines ahead of . rehearsals. He said: 'One day he attacked me in front of . everyone. He said, “You’re slowing me down, and you don’t know your . lines. And if you don’t say your lines, I’m just going to keep saying my . lines.” 'We all sat, . frozen. I snorted a bit, and, turning to him in front of the whole cast, . I asked, “If I don’t say my words fast enough, you’re going to just say . your next line?” I said. “You realise the lines are written in a . certain order?” He just glared at me.' Mr Baldwin claims he asked for a break to cut short the incident and went to speak . to the stage manager with director Dan Sullivan and offered to quit the . project and insisted they didn't fire Mr Labeouf. But . the actor recalls Mr LaBeouf, who he had heard was 'potentially very . difficult to work with', was 'shocked' when he was given his marching . orders from the show. Love-hate . relationship: The volatile star has long lamented the intrusion into . his private life and several homophobic rants have notably affected his . career, with his short-lived Up Late talk show cancelled in November . following an anti-gay slur at a photographer . Elsewhere in the article, which features an accompanying close-up of Mr Baldwin as he . stares into the camera with a neutral, if . a little sour, expression on his face, the Oscar-nominee discusses his . feelings about MSNBC, on which he had short-lived talk show Up Late. The programme was pulled off air for good in November after five episodes . following what was initially a two-week suspension, reportedly . due to Mr Baldwin's use of yet another anti-gay slur during an altercation with a . photographer outside his home. While the official word was that the two . parted ways mutually, sources say the star's 'diva-like behaviour . towards co-workers', along with the homophobic comment, played a . deciding factor in the decision. But . in his New York magazine chat, he insists he 'never wanted' to be on . MSNBC in the first place and describes it as 'the same s**t all day . long' as well as slamming several stars of the channel including talk . show host Joe Scarborough. Speaking about the channel, he said: 'Morning Joe was boring. Scarborough is neither eloquent nor funny. And merely cranky doesn’t always work well in the morning. Mika B. is the Margaret Dumont of cable news. I liked Chris Jansing a lot. Very straightforward. I like Lawrence O’Donnell, but he’s too smart to be doing that show. Rachel Maddow is Rachel Maddow, the ultimate wonk/dweeb who got a show, polished it, made it her own. She’s talented. The problem with everybody on MSNBC is none of them are funny, although that doesn’t prevent them from trying to be.' However, Ms Maddow - who he described as 'phony who doesn't have the same passion for truth off-camera that she seems to have on air - seems to have dismissed his claims, highlighting that they have never even met. She tweeted: 'I have never met Mr. Baldwin, either on-camera or off-camera. I wish him all the best.' Around the same time the Up Late talk . show was pulled, Baldwin lamented the invasion of privacy he and his . family faces on a daily basis, ranting in an open letter on the Huffington Post that he was willing to give it all up to protect his loved ones. 'If . quitting the television business, the movie business, the theater, any . component of entertainment, is necessary in order to bring safety and . peace to my family, then that is an easy choice,' he wrote. 'This country’s obsession with the private lives of famous people is tragic.' 'It is an easy choice': In November, the former 30 Rock actor said it was a no-brainer that he would give up his career for the sake of protecting his family - pictured here with wife Hilaria Baldwin and six-month-old daughter Carmen in Madrid earlier this month .","Two New York police sources say the actor will not be missed should he move to Los Angeles .
