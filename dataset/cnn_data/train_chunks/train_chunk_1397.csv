"The same prosecutors who painted a gang member as the architect of a widespread drug and cellphone smuggling conspiracy said Monday during his sentencing that he actually made the prison safer -- despite impregnating four guards and directing crime on the streets while behind bars. Tavon White was sentenced to 12 years in prison - significantly less than the maximum 20 years he faced - after prosecutors told the judge he quelled violence by instituting a no-stabbing policy among gang members and then took a substantial risk by testifying against others in the ring. White, a commander of the Black Guerilla Family, oversaw a contraband smuggling operation inside the Baltimore City Detention Center that grabbed headlines and resulted in a sweeping indictment of 44 people, including 27 corrections officers. Thirty-five of those charged pleaded guilty, including White; eight maintained their innocence and went to trial. A federal jury last week convicted five people, including two corrections officers, two inmates and a kitchen worker of racketeering. Sentenced: Prosecutors say Tavon White, pictured, dealt drugs, impregnated four guards and oversaw a drug-smuggling operation inside the jail . Once the federal government's primary target, and the poster child for the deep-seated and rampant corruption within Baltimore's jails, White's testimony became prosecutors' most valuable asset. He spent five days on the stand. During opening statements in the two-month trial, Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Harding told jurors, 'We're about to go into a strange place. An upside-down world where inmates ran the prison and correctional officers took directions from the gang leader, all of them participating in an ongoing contraband and narcotics trafficking organization inside the prison.' Prosecutors relied on White, who once declared in a jailhouse phone call, 'This is my jail,' and 'I am the law,' to prove it. At the sentencing Monday, Harding told U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander that White deserved a sizeable reduction from the maximum sentence because of his cooperation. Harding said that although White played a significant role in the conspiracy, he helped make the jail safer, and noted that White took a substantial risk testifying against other members of the notoriously violent gang. 'He has assumed a risk he will have to live with for the rest of his life,' Harding said. 'It took great courage to do what he did. This is a man in danger. 'He became a favorite of prison officials because he quelled violence,' Harding continued. 'He generally made conditions less violent than it would have been otherwise. The government thinks that in a way, he was a positive influence at BCDC.' According to The Baltimore Sun, federal judge Ellen Lipton praised White's courage for testifying. The newspaper quoted Lipton as telling White 'You did quite well.' WBAL reported that at one point federal authorities intercepted White's jail phone call. White reportedly said on the phone 'This is my jail. You understand that. I make every final call in this jail... everything come to me.' Jail: During the trial, White testified that prison guards often engaged in sexual relationships with inmates, and were  in on the contraband smuggling conspiracy that involved sneaking drugs, tobacco and cellphones . During the trial, White testified that prison guards often engaged in sexual relationships with inmates, and were willing participants in the contraband smuggling conspiracy that involved sneaking drugs, tobacco and cellphones into the prison. White, who impregnated four of the guards while in the jail while awaiting trial on an attempted murder charge, said he never forced a guard to participate. 'I didn't have to,' White testified. 'I had my children's mothers, and plenty of other guards willing to do it for money.' White's attorney, Gary Proctor, told Hollander on Monday that White is making an effort to turn his life around and has earned his high school equivalency while behind bars. Proctor added that even if White wanted to return to gang activity, his reputation as a cooperating witness in such a high-profile case would make that impossible. 'The agents, the marshals-they all like Mr. White,' Proctor said. 'And who would take him back? No one will sell drugs with him. It's not like the BGF would throw open their doors and say, ""Welcome back.""' Before handing up White's sentence, Hollander told White that his role in the systematic corruption at the jail 'eroded public confidence in the system,' but added that he 'made attempts to make amends' by coming forward and cooperating with prosecutors just days after he was charged. 'It took a lot of courage with a gang as violent as BGF to come forward and testify,' Hollander said. 'You deserve credit.' White is already serving a 20-year state sentence on an attempted murder charge. The federal sentence will be served concurrently. Proctor said Monday that the Federal Bureau of Prisons has not yet determined where White will serve his sentence. As White, handcuffed and clad in a tan jumpsuit, was escorted across the courtroom floor, Harding stood and patted the man on the back. In return, White turned to the prosecutor and smiled.","Prosecutors say Tavon 'Bulldog' White dealt drugs, impregnated four guards and oversaw a drug-smuggling operation while in jail .

"The Florida woman who was freed from prison in a plea deal after being sentenced to 20 years behind bars says she's relieved to be out of prison, and is making plans for the future. Thirty-four-year-old Marissa Alexander was released from prison Jan. 27 after pleading guilty to three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for the 2010 shooting. Now that she is out of prison, home on house arrest, the mother-of-three says she plans to return to school and work as a paralegal to support her children. Scroll down for video . Future:Marissa Alexander, 34 (center), who was freed from prison in a plea deal after being sentenced to 20 years behind bars, says she's relieved to be out of prison, and is making plans for the future . Guilty: Alexander (center) was released from prison Jan. 27 after pleading guilty to three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for the 2010 shooting . Alexander begins classes at the University of North Florida this spring, The Florida Times-Union reports. She aims to restore the stability that was lost in the lives of her children while she was locked up. Alexander has a four-year-old daughter and 14-year-old twins. Alexander expected to spend the next 20 years in prison when she was sentenced in 2012 after being convicted of three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for firing a gun at her estranged husband and his two sons in August 2010. But an overturning of her conviction led to the plea deal that landed the woman  a three-year sentence -- a sentence she had already served two years and 10 months of -- along with two years of house arrest. 'It was incredibly difficult to take that plea,' Alexander told Times-Union. 'But I thought about my kids; it was mainly the children that made me decide to do it.' Alexander (left and right) was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2012 after being convicted of three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for firing a gun at her estranged husband and his two sons in August 2010 . Alexander held that she acted in self defense when she fired a 'warning shot' in the direction of her estranged husband, Rico Gray, and his two sons, the Times-Union reports. Her account is that Gray beat her after they had an argument and she tried to run away, only to realize she left the keys to her car in the house. She went to retrieve them and took her gun from her glove compartment with her for protection. She said she fired a warning shot at Gray to scare him away after he charged at her and threatened her, according to the Times-Union. Self Defense: Alexander held that she acted in self defense when she fired a 'warning shot' in the direction of her estranged, husband, Rico Gray (right), and his two sons . Alexander's case drew criticism and gained national attention after George Zimmerman was acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin in 2013. Her case became a key point in the debates over the Stand Your Ground and 10-20-Life laws. The woman's Stand Your Ground claim was rejected because she left her home and returned with the gun. The judge, in 2012, held that, though no one was hurt in the incident, he had no choice but to sentence Alexander to 20 years in prison because he was bound by state law to do so. Alexander was given a new trial after a state appeals court determined that the judge made a mistake during jury instructions. No Choice: The judge, in 2012, held that, though no one was hurt in the incident, he had no choice but to sentence Alexander to 20 years in prison because he was bound by state law . Alexander had faced 60 years if convicted at trial because of Florida's minimum-mandatory-sentencing law pertaining to firearm use. With just two years of house arrest standing between her and complete freedom, Alexander tells the Times-Union that she is not ready to become a public figure, but wants to help those caught in the justice system to turn their lives around. Alexander has a master’s degree in business administration from the University of Phoenix, according to the Times-Union, but became passionate about 'legal stuff' while in prison. She says she has found her purpose and is focused on what lies ahead.","Marissa Alexander, 34, was released from prison Jan. 27 and is making plans for the future .

"He lives in one of the most glamorous cities on Earth, has an estimated £600million fortune and has his pick of the world's most lavish hotels when he wants to go on holiday. But rather than join Prince Andrew and the Danish royals on the slopes in Verbier, Monaco's Prince Albert II has been enjoying a luxury break in Mumbles. The 56-year-old royal certainly proved a hit with locals, posing happily for photos with a policewoman and accepting a kiss from rugby player turned wrestler Non Evans while quaffing champagne in one of the resort's bars. Scroll down for video . Worried Albert? The royal gets a kiss from rugby player turned wrestler Non Evans in a Mumbles bar . The Monégasque prince arrived in Wales on Friday night, flying into  Cardiff by private jet before joining footballer Craig Bellamy for supper at a local steakhouse and front-row seats at the rugby. Unfortunately for Albert's host, the game ended in a win for England - a result that the royal, who had been supporting the home team, described as 'disappointing'. Drowning his sorrows with £160 bottles of Dom Perignon champagne at a Mumbles bar later that evening, Albert told owner Adam Jones that he had hoped for a different outcome. 'He was supporting Wales and said he was disappointed by the outcome of the game,' explained Mr Jones, who also revealed that the royal had remained at the bar until 2am. 'I couldn’t believe how friendly and down to earth he was. He is a really nice guy and he took the time to speak to everyone, including the staff. Welcome to Mumbles! Prince Albert poses with a local policewoman during his holiday in Wales . Sporting action: Albert was left 'disappointed' by the outcome of the Wales vs England rugby match . 'It was an incredible weekend. The bar has been opened for five years, but this is the best weekend we have had so far.' Albert, who was staying at the five star Patricks Hotel, spent Saturday exploring the spectacular Gower peninsula and took in the region from the air during a 30-minute helicopter tour. Afterwards, he visited the local lifeboat station, where he was presented with a pair of knitted dolls for his two-month-old twins, Prince Jacques Honore Ranier and Princess Gabriella Therese Marie. Speaking afterwards, lifeboat captain Dai Thomas said the prince had enjoyed his tour. 'He was interested in the lifeboat station and the new system we’ve got,' explained Mr Thomas. 'He was thrilled and thought the lifeboat was one of the best he had seen.' Wrong result: The game, at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, ended with a 16-21 victory for England . Beautiful: Mumbles sits on the edge of the Gower Peninsula and is famous for spectacular beaches . Travels: Albert often travels for sport and is seen in London in 2012 (left) and watching petanque in 2013 . Mumbles, which is famous for its spectacular sandy beaches, has long been a popular holiday destination and boasts a listed Victorian pier. Although not an obvious choice of destination for a visiting head of state, the area has hosted several royal visits, most notably from Queen Alexandra in 1904. Like Alexandra, Albert ended his visit to Wales with a trip to Swansea, where he watched the local side take on Sunderland in the Premier League. After watching the teams draw 1-1, the royal flew back to Monaco to join his wife Charlene, 36, and their baby twins at the Palais Princier. Home: On Saturday night, Albert returned home to glamorous Monaco and the Palais Princier . No thanks! Albert decided not to join the Danish royals in Verbier and went to Wales instead . It might not be quite as glamorous as Monte Carlo but what Mumbles - and the surrounding Gower peninsula - lacks in glitz, it more than makes up for in natural beauty. Highlights include the curving Swansea Bay which covers a six-mile stretch of Bristol Channel coastline and ends in Mumbles itself. Along with its magnificent pier, which was built in 1898, Mumbles is also home to the mediaeval Oystermouth Castle which was built in 1203 and glowers out over the village from its perch atop a hill. The majority of visitors, however, use their Mumbles break to explore the stunning Gower peninsula, a 70 square mile finger of land that juts out into the Irish Sea. Its waters are home to an incredible array of wildlife, including whales and dolphins, while its dramatic coastline boasts a series of small rocky bays popular with daytrippers. Striking: Rhossili Bay is one of the Gower Peninisula's most famously beautiful beaches . Stunning: Three Cliffs Bay is another popular spot for day trippers hoping to enjoy its golden sand .","Albert flew into Cardiff on Friday night for the Six Nations rugby match .

"Pastor George Hunley has been arrested for falsely reporting a crime after police said they did not believe his versions of events that he was shot . A pastor who claimed he was shot in the arm after a man he attempted to help turned on him, has been arrested because police do not believe his 'good Samaritan' story. George Hunley told officers he had acted selflessly to try and help a black man and white woman on the side of the road who were having car trouble in Louisa County when he was robbed and shot twice in the leg. Hunley, who claimed a struggle ensued during which he broke his attacker's arm, has now been arrested himself for falsely reporting a crime. Police are now investigating how Hunley, who was arrested on Friday, suffered the gunshot wounds. Major Donnie Lowe, the Louisa County Deputy Chief. told WRIC: 'Everything right now points to us believing that there was no armed robbery, there was no bi-racial couple, that all of that didn't happen. 'The vehicle that he was in, where he drove home from the robbery, there was no blood in it at all. And we did manage to find his wallet and his checkbook and everything in his vehicle.' Officers also said they had been unable to find the crime scene Hunley described. The 54-year-old's story began to unravel when he refused to take a polygraph test after the incident. Scroll down for video . At the time he told WWBT: 'I'm on painkillers. 'I've been in shock. I've been shot twice. I had to wrestle for my life. There is no way in this world I'm going to take a polygraph test. They are too inconclusive.' Police said pastor George Hunley's story did not add up and they had found his wallet in his car . Officers said everything points to no armed robbery and no couple Hunley claims he tried to help . Hunley had previously claimed he pulled over in Chalk Level Road to help the couple, who were travelling in a blue Taurus with a one-year-old child, because they were having car trouble. The pastor, who has been a minister for 32 years, then said the man turned on him with a gun and demanded money. He was released from the University of Virginia Medical Center and is due in court on February 17.","George Hunley is a pastor and was suffered gunshot wounds to his legs .

"Monster Beverage has been sued by the family of a 14-year-old girl who died after she had just two cans of the energy drink. The Food and Drug Administration . announced today it was investigating reports of five deaths associated with the drink and one non-fatal heart attack, prompting the company's . shares to fall 14 per cent. Anais Fournier, died on December 23, 2011 . from a heart attack brought on by 'caffeine toxicity' after drinking two 24-ounce Monster cans within 24 hours. Scroll down for video . Toxic: The parents of Anais Fournier, who died from caffeine toxicity after two cans of Monster energy drink, have filed a lawsuit . The FDA reported people had adverse reactions after they consumed . Monster Energy Drink, which comes in 24-ounce cans and contain 240 . milligrams of caffeine - or seven times the amount of the caffeine in a . 12-ounce cola. The wrongful death suit, filed in California . Superior Court in Riverside, said that after drinking two 24-ounce cans . of Monster Energy on consecutive days, Anais went into cardiac arrest. An autopsy revealed the teenager, from Hagerstown, Maryland, died of cardiac arrhythmia due to caffeine toxicity that impeded her heart's ability to pump blood. The medical examiner also found that she had an inherited disorder that can weaken blood vessels. Miss Fournier's parents Wendy Crossland and Richard Fournier claim Monster failed to warn about the risks of drinking its products. Ms Crossland told the Record Herald: 'I was shocked to learn the FDA can regulate caffeine in a can of soda, but not these huge energy drinks. 'With their bright colors and names like Monster, Rockstar, and Full Throttle, these drinks are targeting teenagers with no oversight or accountability. These drinks are death traps for young, developing girls and boys, like my daughter, Anais.' Monster is the leading U.S. energy drink . by volume with nearly 39 per cent of the market, but Austria's Red . Bull has the highest share by revenue due to its premium price. The company touts Monster Energy Drink on its website as a 'killer energy brew' and 'the meanest energy supplement on the planet'. The cans bear labels stating that the drinks are not recommended for children and people who are sensitive to caffeine. Health concerns: The FDA said it was investigating reports of five deaths and a non-fatal heart attack linked to highly caffeinated Monster Energy Drinks . Although the FDA is investigating the . allegations, which date back to 2004, the agency said the reports don't . necessarily prove that the drinks caused the deaths or injuries. 'As with any reports of a death or injury the agency receives, we take them very seriously and investigate diligently,' Shelly Burgess said in a statement. Monster Beverage Corp said it does not believe its drinks are 'in any way responsible' for Miss Fournier's death. 'Monster . is unaware of any fatality anywhere that has been caused by its . drinks,' the company said in a statement. It said it intends to . vigorously defend itself in the suit. Monster's shares plunged $7.59, or 14.2 percent, to close at $45.73 in trading on Monday. Tragic: Miss Fournier died following a cardiac arrest on December 23, 2011 . Energy drinks are a tiny part of the carbonated soft drink market, representing about 3 per cent of sales volume, according to a recent report by industry tracker Beverage Digest. Last year, sales volume for energy drinks rose by nearly 17 per cent. The increased sales have brought heightened scrutiny from state and federal authorities. In August, New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman issued subpoenas to energy drink makers, including Monster, as part of the state's investigation of the industry. In September, Senators Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asked the FDA to take another look at the effect that caffeine and other ingredients in energy drinks have on children and adolescents. Taking a dip: Monster Beverage Corp, which is based in California, saw shares fall by more than 14 per cent .","Anais Fournier, from Maryland, had heart attack brought on by 'caffeine toxicity' two days before Christmas last year .

"All that sugar, all those E numbers... Easter is bound to be a somewhat hectic occasion whenever children are involved. Family arguments are going to happen, and the first is usually at 1.30pm on Easter Sunday and involves someone getting upset about their chocolate eggs being either broken or stole, according to research.

"Militant French fishermen threatened to blockade Channel ferry ports last night in a mounting dispute over access to scallop stocks. The ultimatum came after 40 French vessels attacked a fleet of eight British boats with flares and rocks in international waters.

'There will be further action. This will certainly mean strikes and blockades. The government must take notice.' Fisherman Claude Milliner said: . 'Enough is enough.

"A classic sportscar once owned by French actor Alain Delon then lost for decades has became the fifth most expensive car ever sold on Friday when it was auctioned for $23 million. The Ferrari 250 GT SWB is one of 36 ever made and one of 60 classic cars discovered rotting away and forgotten on a farm in western France last year. Other gems found on the farm sported gleaming names like Bugatti, Hispano-Suiza, Talbot-Lago, Panhard-Levassor, Maserati, Delahaye and Delage. And some have gone for three to four times asking price. Scroll down for video . Crown jewel: A super rare Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spyder sold Friday at auction for a stunning $23 million, making it the fifth most expensive car ever sold . However, the Ferrari--a type that's featured 13 times on the list of the 100 most expensive cars ever sold--is seen as the crown jewel of the show by most. Aside from its rarity, the Ferrari is prized for having been photographed carrying stars Delon as well as Shirley MacLaine and Jane Fonda during the 1964 filming of Les Felins. It was sold Friday at the Artcurial auction house in Paris, where managing director Matthieu Lamoure likened the find to the discovery of King Tut's tomb. 'We were overcome with emotion. Probably much like Lord Carrington and Howard Carter, on being the first for centuries to enter Tutankhamun's tomb,' he told AFP. The 1956 Maserati that occupied that spot next to the Ferrari's on the farm was also sold Friday, when it fetched close to $2 million. Prized: The Ferrari is one of just 36 ever produced. It's name has come up 13 times among the 100 most expensive cars ever sold . Famous ride: Aside from its rarity, the Ferrari is prized for having been photographed carrying stars Alain Delon (left) as well as Shirley MacLaine and Jane Fonda (right) during the 1964 filming of Les Felins . The cars were collected from the 1950s to the 1970s by entrepreneur Roger Baillon, who dreamt of restoring them to their former glory and displaying them in a museum. However, his plans were dashed as his business struggled, forcing Mr Baillon to sell about 50 of the vehicles. Since then his collection has sat dormant in makeshift corrugated iron shelters and outbuildings on the farm. Mr Baillon died about 10 years ago and his son, Jacques, who inherited the collection, died last year. Mr Baillon's grandchildren had no idea of the extent of the collection, calling in car specialists Lamoure and Pierre Novikoff of Artcurial to estimate its value. IN demand: The car was among 60 classic rides found on a farm in western France last year, many of which have since auctioned for three to four times their asking price .

"Louis van Gaal has given a clear indication that Wayne Rooney will be his new captain after seeing the England striker lead Manchester United to victory over Liverpool in the International Champions Cup final. Rooney was set to succeed Nemanja Vidic as skipper at Old Trafford under David Moyes but Van Gaal’s appointment led to suggestions that he would give the armband to his Holland captain Robin van Persie instead. However, Rooney was chosen to lead United for the first time under the Dutchman at the Sun Life Stadium in Miami, and afterwards Van Gaal hinted that he would prefer to give the job to an Englishman.

Rooney played 90 minutes for the first time. Darren Fletcher had already done it two times, then he was the captain, and Tom Cleverley because he also had 90 minutes.’ Rooney was also voted the Most Valuable Player of the tournament after scoring his fifth goal on tour in United’s 3-1 win over their old rivals. Van Gaal agreed with the decision, saying it was more merited than the same award given to Lionel Messi at the World Cup this summer. ‘He is a man who is always a winner,’ added the United boss. ‘You saw in the World Cup when the award went to Messi it is not always like that. It is deserved because he scored a lot of goals and made assists. The judges are always looking for that. ‘But we have also defended very well and without defence we cannot score. A lot of my defenders could have been Most Valuable Player of this tournament. Main man: Rooney was named Most Valuable Player of the tournament after scoring five goals .

A lot of my defenders could have been Most Valuable Player of this tournament. ‘His was a wonderful goal and very important for him, I believe. When you see the technique and what he did to push the ball under the legs of the opponent and into the bottom corner. It was a great cross by Hernandez of course – it was a very good attack.’ Van Gaal played down the importance of lifting the International Champions Cup after finishing the tour unbeaten, but acknowledged that beating Liverpool would delight their fans. Asked the value of winning the tournament, he replied: ‘Nothing. It’s nice for the fans in the USA but also at home that we beat Liverpool. It’s not our favourite opponent I think for Man United fans. We have given a lot of pleasure to these fans and that is very important. VIDEO Van Gaal wants reinforcements .

Game over: Jesse Lingard celebrates scoring a third to put the game beyond Liverpool . ‘Of course it is better to win in pre-season than to lose. The most important game is Swansea at home in the first game, that’s the one we have to win. ‘It’s better to win and maybe you have noticed in the media that first we beat Roma and then Inter Milan and then Real Madrid. It was not enough because now it was a test in the Premier League.’ Van Gaal also confirmed that Antonio Valencia came off after only five minutes as a precaution and that Danny Welbeck is recovering from a knee injury. Asked about any new signings, he said: ‘I cannot say anything fresh about players. That you can understand. When I say something it raises the price, so it’s not nice.’","Louis van Gaal is set to name Wayne Rooney as his captain .

"Former first lady of Virginia Maureen McDonnell will spend 18 months in jail for public corruption, if prosecutors get their way. The wife of disgraced former Governor, Bob McDonnell, is due to be sentenced later this month for her part in illegally accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans. He has already been handed a two-year prison term but remains free during his appeal. In it together: A jury found Bob and Maureen McDonnell guilty of public corruption after they illegally accepted $165,000 in gifts and loans from vitamin entrepreneur Jonnie Williams . Prosecutors and defense lawyers filed memos arguing their positions ahead of McDonnell's sentencing on February 20. Her lawyers have argued she should be sentenced to probation and 4,000 hours of community service, while prosecutors said she was a 'full participant' in the crime. 'Because Mrs McDonnell was a full participant in a bribery scheme that sold the Governor's office in exchange for luxury goods and sweetheart loans, many of which she solicited personally, and because she repeatedly attempted to thwart the investigation through false representations, it would be unjust for her not to serve a period of incarceration for her crimes,' documents said. Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell was sentenced to two years after his conviction for public corruption. Prosecutors want his wife Maureen to be given 18-months while her lawyers call for probation . Last year, a jury found McDonnell and his wife guilty of illegally accepting high-value gifts including a Rolex watch, designer clothing, vacations and loans from wealthy vitamin entrepreneur Jonnie Williams, in exchange for promoting his products. Williams testified under immunity as the prosecution's star witness in a case that exposed the details of the McDonnells' shaky finances and troubled marriage. McDonnell testified in his own defense during the six-week trial, acknowledging that he accepted Williams' handouts but did nothing for him in return other than extend routine political courtesies. He was convicted of 11 counts. U.S. District Judge James R. Spencer surprised many legal experts last month when he sentenced former Gov. Bob McDonnell to only two years, well below the 10 sought by prosecutors.","Maureen McDonnell could be in prison by the end of the month .

"A serial killer who lured his victims with the promise of cheap designer jeans has confessed to a third murder after more than 30 years. Jesus Aguilero, who arrived in the United States on the 1980 Mariel boatlift from Cuba went on a killing spree in the Bronx, New York, in 1981, murdering Guillermo Graniela, 30, and Josefina Cepeda, 24. The 61-year-old, who is behind bars for the slayings, has now pleaded guilty to killing 35-year-old mother Tolila Brown in the same year. Confession: Jesus Aguilero, 61, who arrived in the United States on the 1980 Mariel boatlift from Cuba, has admitted killing 35-year-old Tolila Brown in 1981. He is already behind bars for two separate murders . The 35-year-old prostitute was strangled and left to die in a shack in Minford Place. He initially denied being behind the murder, but according to The New York Post he changed his mind because horrific details of the other deaths would have been discussed and may have sealed his fate. The Post reported that Aguilero’s DNA was drawn in 2001 while he was serving a 45-year-to-life sentence for those murders. Then in 2009, NYPD detective Malcolm Reiman linked him to the murder with fingerprints and DNA evidence at the scene. In June, the lab discovered it matched DNA found under Moore’s fingernails. He is the prime suspect in two other, unsolved murders including the death of Janet Agosto, 20, in 1982. Aguilero is up for parole in 2026, however his defense lawyer Javier Solano believes there is 'no way on Earth' he would be released.

"A Texas jury convicted Donald Collins this evening of capital murder for raping and then setting a boy on fire. Collins was 13 years old when he attacked then 8-year-old Robbie Middleton in 1998, leaving him with horrific burns affecting 99 per cent of his body. Middleton died in 2011, at age 21, from skin cancer. It took jurors all Monday afternoon to reach the guilty verdict. Collins could face up to 40 years in prison when he is sentenced. Scroll down for video . Convicted: Donald Collins (left) has been found guilty of capital murder for raping Robert Middleton (right) and setting him on fire in 1998 . 'This man committed capital murder when he poured gas on Robert Middleton and set him on fire,' prosecutors said during closing arguments. Montgomery County Chief Prosecutor Rob Freyer called Collins 'a child rapist, a murderer and a monster' in his final impassioned plea to the members of the Galveston County jury. 'Today, after so many days, after so many tears, after so much pain and frustration with the system, today that little boy gets to hit back,' he said. He then turned to Collins and added: 'Today is the day that you pay, according to theHouston Chronicle. Collins, 29, will not face the death penalty because he was 13 years old when he committed the crime. The trial's punishment phase begins Tuesday. 'It's been so long and we've waited and waited and now that it's here, it's like, maybe it'll sink in later,' Colleen Middleton, the victim's mother, told ABC13 upon hearing the verdict. Middleton expressed hope that her son's tormentor will get the maximum sentence. During Collins' trial last week, the jury heard a heartbreaking deathbed video of Middleton where he named Collins as the person who raped and set him alight in an attempt to cover up his crime. Robbie succumbed to cancer, believed to have been caused by the horrific burn injuries he suffered 13 years before. A medical examiner ruled his death a homicide. In 1998, Robbie was tied to a tree, doused with gasoline and set alight on his 8th birthday in woodland behind his home in Splendora, Texas. At trial last Thursday, the jury was shown a 30-minute video of Robbie just 17 days before he died. According to the Houston Chronicle, on the tape Robbie said: 'Don grabbed me, turned me around and threw gas in my face.' Spared: Collins, 29, will not face the death penalty because he was 13 years old when he committed the crime . Robbie Middleton eventually died from skin cancer in 2011, thought to have been caused by the severe burns he suffered 13 years before . He said that he was blinded by the gasoline but when he realized he was on fire, he started to run from the woodland trail back home. He added: 'I was running as fast as I could but I couldn't see where I was running to', recalling that he was screaming and in horrific pain. The 21-year-old Robbie was then asked by the interviewer, attorney Craig Sico, if he was sexually assaulted by Collins. Robbie replied that two weeks before he was burned, Collins 'took me out into the woods where I was burned. He pulled my clothes down and started raping me'. The prosecution has alleged that Collins set eight-year-old Robbie on fire to prevent his crime being discovered. While the jury watched the video, the defendant turned his back to the screen and seemed to read a newspaper, the Chronicle reported. Collins has pleaded not guilty. His defense lawyer has claimed that Robbie, who spent most of his life at Shriner's Children's Hospital in Galveston, named Collins along with many others soon after the attack. Attorney E. Tay Bond said there was not enough evidence to convict Collins and accused the Middleton family's attorney of making up the rape theory. Robbie's mother Colleen Middleton choked back tears as she told the jury on Wednesday about how Robbie told her Don Collins, 13, had tied him up and set him on fire . The defense team added that there were no witnesses to the attack and claimed prosecutors were playing to the jury's emotions. 'Do not expect the defense to bring an eyewitness to this tragedy because there is not one,' Bond told jurors. 'There are no witnesses from the woods except for Robbie.' However, prosecutors countered that witnesses will testify that Collins admitted to them that he poured gasoline on Robbie. 'Our case is based on the testimony of adults who have come forward and can tell you what this man did when they were children,' Montgomery County prosecutor Kelly Blackburn said in his opening statement. Collins was convicted of raping another eight-year-old boy in 2001 at gunpoint. From the age of 16, he spent four years in a juvenile detention center for the crime. The victim testified at a 2013 hearing to determine whether Collins should be tried as an adult for the crime against Robbie Middleton. The victim said that Collins threatened to burn him if he told anyone about the assault. A judge determined last March that Collins could be tried for murder as an adult, despite being a teenager at the time. In 1998, Robbie had named Collins as his attacker and the 13-year-old was arrested. It was determined last year that Collins, now 29, could be tried as an adult in the murder trial even though he was 13 years old (pictured) when he allegedly raped and set eight-year-old Robbie Middleton on f . Collins spent several months in juvenile detention but was released after prosecutors said they didn't have enough evidence to pursue the case . On Wednesday, Robbie's mother, Colleen, choked back tears as she told the Houston court how Collins had 'stalked' her son in the days before the attack. She testified that Robbie told her Don Collins, 13, had tied him up and set him on fire. Mrs Middleton, who said she did not recognize her son when she found him covered in burns from head to toe collapsed by her home, said that in the months after the attack he was so delirious with pain that he named everyone he knew as his attacker - including the family dog. However, after almost a year, and when he began to regain lucidity, he named Don Collins as his attacker - and never wavered. Mrs Middleton said it had been a 'long road' for the family and they were unclear if Robbie would ever get justice for the horrific injuries he had suffered. She said: 'When Robert died, we were thinking maybe nothing will ever happen. Maybe someone is just going to get away with what they did to him.'","Robbie Middleton's frail voice named suspect Donald Collins as his rapist and torturer, just shortly before he died aged 21 in 2011 .

"Everyone knows the term ‘get them while they’re young,’ but is this taking things a step too far? Bizarre footage has surfaced of a Chinese toddler dressed in pyjamas running on a treadmill under the order of his parents. The vision, which was uploaded to Chinese website Ku6 on Sunday, features the parents laughing in the background as they gradually turn up the speed of the treadmill, forcing the 17-month-old boy to run at full speed. The father orders the one-year-old child to 'hurry up' as he struggles to keep up with the speed of the treadmill . The child struggles to keep up with the conveyor belt, edging towards the back of the machine before his father, who is in stitches, finally lifts him off. The father is repeatedly telling the child to ‘hurry up! hurry up!’ in Chinese throughout the clip. The mother can be heard saying ‘don't make it too fast,’ while failing to contain her own laughter. The description for the video describes the baby running on the treadmill as 'adorable'. The parents can be heard laughing hysterically as they increase the speed of the conveyor belt . Children can suffer serious injuries as lacerations, fractures or amputation on treadmills . An article published last month on prominent health website LiveStrong explained why letting children use treadmills is fraught with danger. ‘Children may not be able to keep up with the high speeds a treadmill reaches, so they may trip and fall when using it,’ the article reads. ‘Also, children might insert their fingers between moving parts or around the edges of the running belt, leading to such serious injuries as lacerations, fractures or amputation.’ According to a warning for the NSW Fair Trading in 2013, 95 per cent of those who suffer injuries on treadmills are children. The notice ‘urged parents to keep youngsters well away from treadmills.’ The father finally lifts him off moments before the child slips off the back of the machine .","The bizarre video was uploaded to Chinese website Ku6 on Sunday .

"Two policemen have been charged with brutally beating a man, leaving him with broken bones and needing stitches, after his girlfriend found a video which showed they had savagely attacked him. Najee Rivera was left covered in blood and with an eye swollen shut after police claimed they had been forced to restrain him after he slammed one into a wall when they pulled him over in North Philadelphia. Officers had believed Kevin Robinson and Sean McKnight's version of events until Mr Rivera's girlfriend investigated the incident herself and found it was in fact the two police officers, rather than her boyfriend, who had been violent. Najee Rivera was left bruised after he was beaten by two police officers who stopped him in Philadelphia and falsely claimed he had been violent, until Mr Rivera's girlfriend found a video proving police attacked him . Both  have been charged with aggravated assault, conspiracy and related crimes. The video, found by Mr Rivera's girlfriend Dina Scannapieco at a barber's shop, showed the two policemen punching and using batons to beat the 23-year-old, the Inquirer reported. Police admitted the incident had not been investigated and the two officers had been believed without question. They may now review the way they deal with situations where someone arrested has been injured. On May 29, 2013, Mr Rivera was pulled over by police for for running a stop sign on his scooter near Seventh and Cambria Streets in Fairhill. Seeing the two officers armed with batons, he fled and they chased him. On the 2700 block of North Sixth, a surveillance camera caught them knocking Rivera from his scooter, then grabbing and hitting him with fists and batons. During the video Mr Rivera's screams can be heard. The officers had claimed that Mr Rivera had fled after being stopped and then lost control of his bike, falling off in North Sixth. They then said he had slammed Robinson against a wall and attacked them 'with elbows.' He was then taken to Episcopal Hospital and the two officers' filed charges against him for assault and resisting arrest. Kevin Robinson (left) and Sean McKnight (right) have been charged with aggravated assault and suspended . Mr Rivera was left needing stitches to his face and with a broken bone in his eye socket. But when Miss Scannapieco went to the hospital and found her boyfriend beaten and covered in blood she did not believe the police's version and decided to turn detective herself. She went back to the 2700 block of North Sixth and found her boyfriend's blood covering the pavement. After asking around she managed to get hold of a surveillance video from a barber's shop which showed the brutal attack by the two officers. They eventually handed themselves in and were suspended from duty and are likely to be dismissed. District Attorney Seth Williams said: 'This type of behavior has absolutely no place in our city, and I will prosecute these two officers to the fullest extent of the law.' In August 2013 all the charges against Mr Rivera were dropped. Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said before the video surfaced the officers' version of events had been accepted without question. He admitted the department should have investigated the area after the incident - a process which usually only takes place after an internal complaint is made. He said McKnight and Robinson do not represent the majority of officers on the 6,500-strong force. But, he admitted, he could not guarantee all officers stick within the parameters of the law. He said: 'We've got to root them out.' Mr Rivera said he has struggled to move on since the attack and had lost his job. He added: 'Every time I get next to a cop or a cop is behind me, I get a little panic attack. And it's sad, because every cop ain't bad.' Public Defender Bradley Bridge said his office is now to review arrests made in the past in light of the charges against the two officers. In 2012, Robinson was accused of beating 28-year-old Darren Trammell during an arrest. Robinson was cleared by the Internal Affairs department but months later Trammell was also cleared of any wrongdoing. The city settled the case for $125,000.","Najee Rivera was arrested by police in 2013 and was left badly bruised .

"Reverend Stephen Sizer (pictured) used his internet accounts to spread ideas which were 'clearly anti-Semitic', the Church of England said . A vicar who suggested Israel was responsible for the 9/11 attack on the twin towers has been banned from Twitter and other social media for six months, the Church of England said yesterday. The Reverend Stephen Sizer used his internet accounts to spread ideas which were ‘clearly anti-Semitic’, it said. But despite his ‘indefensible’ actions the cleric will be allowed to remain a priest and to keep his job as vicar of the wealthy parish of Christ Church in Virginia Water in Surrey. The Church’s verdict on Mr Sizer follows a series of clashes between the vicar and Jewish leaders over his vehement campaigning against Israel, during which he attended a conference in Iran during which Israel was accused of plotting the 9/11 attack. The controversy over the vicar came to a crisis last month when he posted an article on his Facebook page which attempted to connect wealthy Jews to the attacks. ‘Is this antisemitic?’ Mr Sizer commented under the link, adding ‘It raises so many questions.’ Yesterday Bishop of Guildford the Right Reverend Andrew Watson said that the vicar’s campaigning on the Middle East was ‘no longer compatible with his ministry as a parish priest.’ The bishop declared: ‘I do not believe that his motives are anti-Semitic; but I have concluded that, at the very least, he has demonstrated appallingly poor judgment in the material he has chosen to disseminate, particularly via social media, some of which is clearly anti-Semitic. ‘By associating with or promoting subject matter, which is either ambiguous in its motivation, or, worse still, openly racist, he has crossed a serious line. I regard these actions as indefensible.’ Bishop Watson said he welcomed the fact that Mr Sizer apologised amid the controversy that followed his latest Facebook intervention in the debate over terrorism together with ‘his recognition of the deep hurt caused by his actions, his acknowledgement of the gross insensitivity of their timing just prior to Holocaust Memorial Day, and his retraction of the ridiculous suggestion that Israel may have been complicit in the events of 9/11.’ The bishop set a series of conditions for Mr Sizer keeping his job. They include a promise from the vicar to stop using social media entirely for six months, to stop writing and speaking about the Middle East and its history, and to stay away from conferences that promote an anti-Zionist agenda. He has also undertaken to stop writing or preaching anything on the subject, to avoid posting links to articles on the subject, and to prevent anyone else from speaking on his behalf on the matter. Al Qaeda terrorists crashed two hijacked planes into the World Trade Centre Towers, killing thousands . Mr Sizer will resign from his job at Christ Church immediately if he breaks his pledges ‘in letter or in spirit’, the bishop added. Bishop Watson said that Mr Sizer will ‘redirect his energies into his work as a parish priest.’ The bishop added: ‘I am hugely sorry for the hurt which has been caused to members of the Jewish Community, and I hope and pray that the storms of the past two weeks will ultimately serve to deepen and strengthen our relationship, one with another. This is a time when I would urge all Christian people to stand shoulder to shoulder with our Jewish brothers and sisters in countering the alarming rise of anti-Semitic incidents being reported.’ The Board of Deputies, the representative body for British Jews, said: ‘We are grateful that the Church shared our deep concern that Mr Sizer had indeed crossed a line in the offensive materials he was posting and linking to online. ‘We hope that Mr Sizer’s unbecoming and inappropriate conduct has now been brought to a close.’ Yesterday’s pledges were not the first time the vicar has undertaken to moderate the views he promotes on the internet. Following complaints by the Board of Deputies in 2013, he promised that in future three people would read his website and blog in order to check the content and monitor links to websites.","Vicar suggested Israel was responsible for 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers .

"More men are raped in the U.S. than woman, according to figures that include sexual abuse in prisons. In 2008, it was estimated 216,000 inmates were sexually assaulted while serving time, according to the Department . of Justice figures. That is compared to 90,479 rape cases outside of prison. 216,000 prisoners are raped per year in the U.S., compared to about 90,000 reported rapes outside prison . The Department for Justice has now begun implementing new regulations to tackle the high rates of rape in federal prisons. In recent studies 4.5 per cent of 16 and 17-year-olds in . adult prison and 4.7 per cent of those in jail reported being the victims . of sexual abuse. The new Department of Justice rape regulations include separating under 18s from adult prisoners. However, some critics say that will leave many youngsters in virtual solitary confinement. The new regulations also include banning male prison staff from doing pat-downs in women's prisons. The rule changes have been brought in ten years after Congress passed the Prison Rape Elimination Act. Under the terms of the act, all detention facilities are required to take a zero-tolerance approach to rape behind bars. New regulations are being introduced at all detention facilities to tackle the number of rapes in prison . According to the latest National Inmate Survey, 4 per cent of prisoners, 3.2 per cent of people in jail and 9.5 per cent of those in juvenile detention said they had been the victim of sexual abuse. Almost seven per cent of women said they had been sexually abused by a fellow inmate, while more men said they had been assaulted by staff. The National Survey of Youth in Custody found 4.5 per cent of juveniles held in adult prisons had been abused. Those figures have prompted calls for all under 18s to be detained outside adult prisons. Of the youngsters held in juvenile detention, 2.5 per cent of boys and girls and said they had been abused by fellow inmates. Shockingly, more than 7 per cent of teenagers in juvenile detention said they had sexual contact with staff. Procedures also must be put in place to investigate allegations of sexual assault and improve care for victims. The report found incidents of women prison staff assaulting male prisoners. States that do not implement the regulations will lose five per cent of their federal funding for prisons, US News reported. They have also been warned they could face civil court cases from victims. Separate figures produced by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that sexual abuse rates in juvenile detention were as high as 9.5 per cent in 2011 to 2012. In the same year, four per cent of state and federal prisoners and 3.2 per cent of all people in jail surveyed said they had been a victim. Study author Allen J. Beck told New York Review of Books that the work shows almost 200,000 were sexually abused in detention in 2011. He said the figures are lower than those recorded in 2008 because fewer people are in prison. High rates of abuse were found among gay, lesbian and mentally ill inmates and inmates who had been abused before incarceration. According to official statistics on rape conviction rates, the U.S. Bureau of Justice said 91 per cent of the victims were women and 99 per cent of the perpetrators were men. Just 9 per cent of accusations made by men resulted in a conviction.","In 2008 it was estimated 216,000 inmates assaulted in detention .

"A 15-year-old boy has pleaded guilty to helping murder the parents of his friend's girlfriend with a sledgehammer because they would not let the couple see each other. Jamall Vaughn, who was 14  when Margaret Schobert, 59, and Jeffrey Schobert, 56, of New Franklin, Ohio, were bludgeoned to death, has signed a guilty plea for aggravated murder. Prosecutors have said Vaughn and then-18-year-old Shawn Ford Jr. walked eight miles from Akron to New Franklin, where they retrieved a sledgehammer from the couple's garage after climbing in through a window. Jamall Vaughn, 15, (pictured) has pleaded guilty to helping murder the parents of his friend's girlfriend with a sledgehammer because they would not let the couple see each other . Margaret, 59, (left) and Jeffrey Schobert, 56, (right) were wary of their adopted daughter's relationship with their killer Shawn Ford Jr . Authorities say Mr Schobert, a health-care lawyer, was the first to be killed when he was struck 14 times with the hammer in his own bedroom during the April 2013 attack. He also had several superficial knife wounds believed to have been inflicted by Vaughn. The teens then used Mr Schobert's cellphone to text Margaret Schobert and urge her to come back to her lakeside home from a hospital where she was staying with her adopted daughter, Chelsea. The daughter had been stabbed and had her skull fractured ten days earlier by Ford because she had refused him sex at a party, prosecutors said. She was in the hospital for a month and originally said that another man had attacked her. Despite her parents' protests, Ms Schobert and Ford were dating at the time. Ford and Vaughn broke into the Schobert's house, pictured after their death, and stole a sledgehammer from their garage . Ford (left) had beaten and stabbed Chelsea Schobert (right) after she refused to have sex with him at a party . The parents had grown wary of the influence Ford, who had a rough upbringing, had over their more affluent daughter and at one point put a GPS device on her car. Vaughn, who was going to be tried as an adult, drank soda and played video games while he and his friend waited for Mrs Schobert to return so they could kill her. Ford killed the couple because they would not allow him to visit Ms Schobert in the hospital, prosecutors said. The Schoberts' bodies were found after 2pm, when workmen who had an agreement to enter the house discovered them. Vaughn also pleaded guilty aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery. Mrs Schobert's watch and ring were stolen during the incident, along with money and the couple's SUV, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. The prosecutors have recommended that Vaughn be given consecutive sentences for the two lesser charges, according to the Akron Beacon Journal. This means that he could serve 52 years before being eligible for parole. A jury found Ford, who is now 20, guilty of aggravated murder last October and then voted to recommend the death penalty. A judge will decide whether to send Ford to death row or to give him life in prison with or without a chance at parole. No sentencing date has been set. Ford, now 20, was found guilty of aggravated murder and the jury recommended that he be given the death penalty . The jury at his trial recommended death, though Ford's attorneys have argued that Ford should not be executed because of his low IQ. Vaughn's trial had been scheduled to start Monday. He could not have received a death sentence because of his age. Attorneys and prosecutors are not permitted to comment about the case because of a judge's gag order. Relatives of the Schoberts said they did not want to comment before Vaughn's sentencing. As of late last year, Ms Schobert was serving 30 months in prison for drug trafficking after buying a large amount of cocaine with a new boyfriend.","Jamall Vaughn, 15, pleaded  to aggravated murder, robbery and burglary .

"An ex-Gurkha forced to defend himself when attacked by a man wielding a knife only realised afterwards a six-inch blade was embedded in his arm. Jamie Hall, 39, has been jailed for 10 years after he stabbed shop owner Taitex Phlamachha, 38, so hard he buried a whole knife in his arm. Mr Phlamachha was out for an evening walk with his wife Asha, 38, when they stopped to have a look in the window of a health shop, in Maidstone, Kent. Heroic: When former Gurkha Taitex Phlamachha was attacked at knife point, he fought back and restrained the attacker. It wasn't until afterwards he realised a blade was embedded in his arm . Suddenly Mr Phlamachha was thrust up against the wall and allegedly told to 'hand over the money', or get stabbed. The former soldier and black belt in karate and taekwondo, said 'yes' - then calmly warned the attacker: 'First you should know who I am.' The tussling pair then fell to the ground where the mugger knelt on his chest and tried to thrust his knife into the victim's stomach. But the ex-Gurkha blocked the attacks and managed to throw his mobile phone to his wife so she could dial 999. He then threw the attacker off him and disabled him with a kick. For the next 15 minutes he held onto the attacker with one hand while waiting for the police. Bizarrely, the Iraq and Afghanistan veteran was unaware he had a whole blade embedded in his arm until he noticed the handle of the knife on the road. Embedded: The X-ray shows just how large the blade was that initially went unnoticed by the heroic ex-Gurkha . Medics took him to Maidstone Hospital before he was later transferred to Tunbridge Wells Hospital, Kent, where surgeons removed the blade. Hall, from Maidstone, Kent, admitted attempted robbery, causing grievous bodily harm with intent, having an offensive weapon and assault. Judge Michael Carroll, who had called the attack 'heinous', imposed an extended sentence on Hall who will not be eligible for parole until he has served two thirds and will then be on licence for a further five years. Mr Phlamachha, a Gurkha with Maidstone's 36 Engineers for 13 years, was attacked as he walked with his wife on October 7. The couple, who run Namaste Off . Licence in Sandling, were on their way home at about 10pm - having just . withdrawn £1,300 from a cash machine. Speaking after the attack ex-soldier Mr Phlamachha said: 'I tried to warn him. Don't mess with Gurkhas. We're trained to fight. Guilty: Jamie Hall, 39, stabbed shop owner Taitex Phlamachha, 38, so hard he buried a whole six inch knife in his arm. He has been sentenced to 10 years jail . 'I'm a second dan black belt in karate and a first dan black belt in Taekwondo. 'I did say, ""You need to know who I am"". But he didn't listen.' Mr Phlamachha explained that he was attacked shortly after visiting a cash point. '...he grabbed my arm and pushed me against the wall. 'We fell to the ground and he kept trying to stab me, but I managed to block them. 'My wife was terrified he was going to kill me. She was screaming for help so I threw her my mobile phone. 'Eventually I threw him off me but he tried to push my wife over. 'I kicked him and punched him then I heard him say, ""I'm in trouble now."" 'I saw the knife handle on the floor with no blade, then noticed all the blood coming out of my arm, so I said, ""You're in trouble. And I'm in trouble too."" 'I was holding onto his hoodie but he took it off, so I just held on to his t-shirt instead until the police arrived. 'There was lots of blood and I was in pain but it was only when I got to hospital the blade was discovered inside me.' Mr Phlamachha, who retired from the Gurkhas last year, added: 'I'm proud to be a Gurkha and I'm a proud father. 'Nothing like this has ever happened to me before and I will do anything to protect myself and family.'","Ex-Gurkha says man attacked him after visiting a cash point in Maidstone, Kent .

"The family of a woman who was caught on camera being pummeled by a California Highway Patrol trooper on the side of a highway have spoken out for the first time since the incident, demanding justice for the victim. 'He punched and pound and pound on her, the only thing she could do was block her face,' Mayisha Adams, the unnamed victim's daughter, said Saturday. The woman had been walking barefoot on eastbound Interstate 10 west of downtown Los Angeles Tuesday before the officer tackled her to the ground. Scroll down for video . Struggle: A motorist filmed while the officer climbed on top of the woman and proceeded to punch her . Restrained: A California Highway Patrol officer straddles the woman while punching her in the head . A . passing driver videotaped the incident showing the CHP trooper pinning . down the woman and repeatedly punching her in the face. The . victim's family have hired Los Angeles attorney Caree Harper to . represent them in the case against the California Highway Patrol. Harper said her clients want the authorities held accountable for 'beating a great-grandmother in broad daylight.' The . lawyer declined to disclose the woman's name or answer questions about . what she was doing along the edge of one of the city's busiest freeways. 'We . want the focus to be what he was doing to her, not what she was doing' prior to the confrontation, said Harper, who said she is representing . the family. 'She was getting beat like an animal. No one should ever be . beat like that.' The . California Highway Patrol has vowed to carry out a thorough . investigation - but authorities claimed the trooper in question simply . stopped her for her own protection. CHP Assistant Chief Chris O'Quinn said at a news conference that the woman was endangering herself and people in traffic, and the officer was forced to restrain her. O'Quinn added that the woman had begun walking off the freeway but returned when the confrontation occurred. The officer involved has not been identified and has been put on paid administrative leave while the investigation is carried out. Press conference: CHP Assistant Chief Chris O'Quinn, pictured said the woman had been walking on the highway endangering herself and people in traffic, and the officer was trying to restrain her . Passing motorist David Diaz recorded the uniformed officer as he jabbed the woman . at least 11 times in the head Tuesday. 'The most animalistic, most brutal way to subdue someone is to pound someone's head into the concrete with really big blows to the head,' Diaz told ABC7. 'There was no weapons - it's obviously excess force,' he continued. 'He starts really letting loose... He starts pounding down on her face really hard. He doesn't try to grab her hands first.' The video on Diaz's cell phone shows him slowing down for a traffic stop as a woman can be seen heading towards the median on the freeway. As punches begin to fly, the woman can be seen trying to sit up and protect herself by putting up her hands but she does not appear to resist the trooper. The officer approaches her before he forces her to the ground and pins her down, repeatedly hitting her while Diaz and his fellow car passengers gasp in horror. Attack: The motorist said he saw the trooper hit her as many as 15 times with hard blows to the head . Eventually another man - later identified by the CHP as an off-duty officer - approaches the trooper and helps handcuff the woman. 'A physical altercation ensued as the pedestrian continued to resist arrest, at which point a plain clothes, off duty officer assisted in applying the handcuffs,' the CHP said in a statement to ABC7. Diaz told the AP in a phone interview Friday that he arrived as the woman was walking off the freeway. He said she turned around only after the officer shouted something to her. 'He agitated the situation more than helped it,' Diaz said, and started filming soon after. O'Quinn said the incident report listed no injuries for the woman, who would not give her name. 'When asked if she sustained any injuries, the pedestrian did not advise of any nor were any located by the officers at the scene,' according to the CHP statement. The CHP earlier said the woman was booked as 'Jane Doe' and taken to a local hospital for mental and physical evaluation. Outrage: David Diaz, who filmed the altercation on his cell phone, said it was a clear use of excessive form . The officer is on administrative leave while the law enforcement agency investigates. He has not been identified. The video caught the attention of local civil rights leaders, who expressed shock and outrage at their own news conference. 'Speaking for the women of this community, we are angry, we are upset,' said Lita Herron of the Youth Advocacy Coalition. O'Quinn said the CHP would answer community concerns and that an investigative team already has been assembled and has begun its work. 'We are known as an agency that really polices itself,' O'Quinn said. O'Quinn said he could not say what prompted the officer to act as he did. But he noted California Highway Patrol officers have a heightened sense of the dangers of being on the freeway compared with a citizen 'who is not accustomed to the speed and conditions,' especially outside of a car. 'The most dangerous thing that we face is traffic,' O'Quinn said.","Motorist David Diaz filmed a California Highway Patrol officer punching a woman least 11 times in the head on Tuesday .

"Senior Aircraftman Liam Gadsby (pictured) had previously bragged to colleagues about his 'party trick' that allowed him to pull the trigger on a loaded pistol without the bullet being fired . An RAF airman has been jailed after he shot a friend through the stomach whilst demonstrating a 'party trick' with a high-powered weapon during a tour of Afghanistan. Senior Aircraftman Liam Gadsby  was in the back of a Mastiff armoured personnel carrier at Camp Bastion when he fired the Glock pistol. The 23-year-old had previously bragged to shocked colleagues about a technique he had learned which allowed him to pull the trigger on a loaded pistol without the bullet being fired. But the stunt went horribly wrong when he shot a bullet through the stomach of fellow serviceman Senior Aircraftman Jay Johnson. Gadsby was jailed for three years and was dismissed from Her Majesty's service after being found guilty of malicious wounding by an RAF panel following two hours' deliberation at Colchester Military Court. Judge Robert Hill said: 'In a service context it is fairly elementary to understand the reason you do not play around with firearms and point them at people. 'That, on its own, is an example of recklessness but in this case it is far more serious. There is plainly a military imperative to spell out in the clearest terms that servicemen who play around with firearms will be punished. 'We are of the view that the seriousness of this offence can only result in a custodial sentence.' Gadsby - based at RAF Honnington in Suffolk - was sat in the back of the Mastiff when he volunteered to demonstrate his 'party trick' whilst pointing the pistol at 24-year-old SAC Johnson. Just moments later, a single shot rang out, hitting Johnson in his stomach with the bullet passing through his body and out of his back. Despite his horrific injuries, Johnson was initially reluctant to report the incident fearing Army colleagues would ridicule the RAF. He believed the cock-up would make the RAF look like 'twats' because, in his own words, 'The Army would love to hear we shot one of our own lads.' Gadsby denied a charge that he maliciously wounded Johnson in the incident shortly before 10pm on December 4, 2013. The serviceman had previously stumbled across a way of pulling back the top slide of the Glock pistol a short distance without a round entering the chamber. The trick, which he had successfully demonstrated to 'surprised and shocked' colleagues on previous occasions, engaged the trigger therefore allowing the pistol to be fired without a shot coming out. Lieutenant Colonel Will Peters, prosecuting, told a court martial: 'The prosecution case is Senior Aircraftman Gadsby got out of the driver's seat where he was in the front of the vehicle and got into the back and his purpose in so doing was to discuss and ultimately demonstrate his party trick which was performed on his Glock pistol. 'The trick was performed with his loaded Glock pistol and involved him pulling back the cocked slide of a loaded weapon so that the trigger came forward but no round enters the chamber.' He told the court Gadsby had declared 'do you want to see my party trick?' Lt Col Peters said: 'Johnson then saw the defendant cock the pistol by pulling back the slide and the pistol was pointed at him. 'Johnson told him not to point the weapon at him, at which point the defendant laughed. Johnson told him not to pull the trigger, but he did, shooting Johnson in his abdomen.' Lt Col Peters said Gadsby's actions went beyond mere negligent discharge. 'He must have been aware of the obvious dangers of what he was doing,' he added. Senior Aircraftman Johnson told the court of the fateful moment he was shot. He said: 'I was looking into my day sack and then I heard the Glock cock. I looked up and I saw he [Gadsby] was aiming it at my head. I asked him to stop pointing it. I told him I did not find it funny. I said stop messing around, stop pointing it at me. Senior Aircraftman Jay Johnson (left) said he asked Gadsby (right) to stop pointing the gun at him but was told to 'stop being a pussy' 'I also said ""you don't know if there is anything in it"", but he said ""I have done it loads of times mate, stop being a pussy"". 'I said to him, ""mate can you stop it, I don't find it funny"". I started getting panicky and angry. He then lowered his aim from my head onto my torso. At the time I just carried on saying ""can you stop pointing at me?"". 'He just laughed, he lowered his aim to my stomach and said ""look, there is nothing in it"". He then shot me through my stomach and out of my back. 'Once I had been shot, he dropped the pistol and I said ""oh my God, you have shot me"". He said ""Oh my God, what have I done?"" He then got dragged off round the corner and I never saw him again.' The court heard how SAC Johnson was treated in hospital in Afghanistan before being transferred back to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and then on to Headley Court rehabilitation centre in Surrey. He is still undergoing treatment for the injuries he suffered from the shot, has to wear a colostomy bag and has a 13-inch scar running from his chest down to his stomach. He faces complex surgery in the future and has been warned his condition may leave him physically unable to remain in the RAF. At first, he was not going to report the shooting for fear it would be amusing to their Army counterparts. Gadsby was on his second tour of Afghanistan when the incident occurred and had no previous convictions or disciplinary matters against him. Liam Gadsby stood trial at Colchester Military Court (pictured) after denying a charge that he had maliciously wounded Service Aircraftman Jay Johnson while showing off a 'party trick' Gadsby - described as a 'lovely guy' - had on an earlier occasion been told off by a senior officer as he was about to demonstrate his trick. His family has a long tradition in the RAF with both his grandfather and great grandfather serving their country in the RAF. Dingle Clark, mitigating, revealed that since the incident Gadsby has continued to serve at RAF Valley as part of its mountain rescue team. He added: 'It is accepted that the whole incident has been traumatic for SAC Johnson. SAC Gadsby wishes to apologise to Johnson for the terrible mistake he made. There is nothing he would want to do more than rewind the clock back and undo what was done. He has had to live knowing he has caused these injuries to a fellow airman he worked alongside and liked. 'This is someone who has made a serious mistake with serious consequences. He accepts for an offence like this a custodial sentence is inevitable. I ask you give him a sentence that recognises his good character and allows him to remain in the RAF.' Giving evidence, Gadsby admitted on a previous occasion he had carried out the 'trick' whilst pointing a Glock at his own head. Mr Clark said: 'Do you remember doing that yourself?' Gadsby admitted he 'vaguely' recalled the incident. He denied aiming his gun at SAC Johnson, saying he had only pointed it towards the rear of the Mastiff personnel carrier. He said: 'I never purposely directed my weapon towards anyone. That is going to affect them and worry them. The incident occurred at Camp Bastion (pictured), Afghanistan, on December 4, 2013. File image used . 'I was demonstrating the procedure that I had carried out previously - when I fired, the round came out of the chamber and hit SAC Johnson.' Mr Dingle asked: 'Did you ever aim at SAC Johnson's head? 'I did not, no sir,' he replied. 'Did you think you were aiming at SAC Johnson's body or torso?' Gadsby replied: 'No sir, the weapon was generally aiming towards the back of the wagon.' Gadsby said before pulling the trigger, it did not appear that there was a round in the chamber. In the moments after the shooting he was heard to say, 'I can't believe I have done this. What have I done?' He admitted to the court he had been previously been spoken to by a senior officer who warned him not to carry out the trick but said it was just 'general chat' rather than a disciplinary talk. Gadsby had previously admitted a lesser charge of negligence at an earlier hearing. He was found guilty following a three-day hearing. An RAF spokesman said: 'Firstly our thoughts remain with the injured RAF serviceman who remains under medical care. 'With regard to the court martial, the RAF takes weapons safety very seriously and can confirm that Senior Aircraftman (SAC) L D Gadsby has been sentenced to three years' imprisonment and discharge from the RAF. 'The RAF will now take the appropriate administrative action by initiating the discharge process.'","Senior Aircraftman Liam Gadsby, 23, shot a colleague through the stomach .

No one else was hurt in or around Busch Gardens and the injury wasn't life-threatening. Kaitlyn Jacobs, 20, from Seminole in Florida, was visiting Busch Gardens when she was struck by a stray bullet ten minutes before midnight at the Gwazi Pavilion area on New Year's Eve . Police Lt. John Preyer said the woman felt sudden pain in her lower left leg 10 minutes before midnight, apparently the victim of a shot fired in celebration elsewhere. 'She knew her leg was hurting but she didn't know why,' he added. The woman was taken to St Joseph’s Hospital where an X-ray revealed a bullet in her leg. She was treated and released. Police said it was unclear exactly where the shot was fired from, but it was 'definitely from outside the park'. Park officials didn't immediately respond to telephone messages seeking comment.","Kaitlyn Jacobs, 20, from Seminole, was visiting the theme park when she was struck ten minutes before midnight at the Gwazi Pavilion area.

"A 6-year-old girl has reportedly been abducted . A young girl who was reportedly abducted from outside a Brisbane school has been found 'safe and well'. It comes after the 6-year-old was last seen at Ascot State School on the corner of Anthony and Massey streets, Ascot in Brisbane about 1.30pm on Monday. Police have released an official statement to thank the media and public for their assistance. 'For privacy reasons, no further information is available at this time,' the statement said. The girl is described as being of a slim build with a fair complexion and with shoulder-length blonde hair with a red and blue bow and blue eyes. She was wearing a dark blue button- up school shirt that has a red and yellow stripe in it and blue shorts, red socks and one black shoe. A Queensland police spokeswoman  confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the adult involved was known to the girl, who was not named at the request of the family. 'We can confirm that it is not a stranger,' she said. Police  released an abduction alert on Monday night, saying the girl 'may be at risk'. Nearly 30,000 people shared a bright yellow flyer around on Facebook after police appealed for public assistance. Nearby resident Kathy Reade told The Courier Mail the news came as a shock and has left her feeling 'rattled'. 'I didn't see anything, I didn't hear anything,' she said.

"Britain's biggest loyalty card scheme has boosted security after it was targeted by fraudsters in an apparent eBay scam. Nectar, which is used by more than 19 million people, is the latest card scheme to fall foul of fraudsters after it linked up with the auction website to allow customers to spend points online. Under the Nectar and eBay scheme, members can collects points on eBay purchases and then change their points into vouchers to spend on the auction site. Nectar, which is used by over 19 million people, is the latest card scheme to fall foul of fraudsters after it linked up with auction website eBay to allow customers to spend points online . But customers have seen thousands of points going missing from their Nectar account - only to find out later they have been spent on eBay. The problem is believed to have arisen because customers can link their Nectar cards to more than one eBay account, and vice versa. That has allowed fraudsters to steal shoppers' points and move it to their own eBay account to spend without the card holder noticing any unusual activity. The Swales family, from York, were first alerted that their Nectar account had been compromised when they tried to pay for shopping with their card in December but were told they were unable to. After checking their account, they found that 9,000 points had disappeared to later be used on eBay - but not by them. The problem is believed to have arisen because customers can link their Nectar cards to more than one eBay account, and vice versa. Customers have seen thousands of points going missing from their Nectar account - only to find out later they have been spent on eBay . They eventually received a full refund and Nectar is now investigating what happened, after telling the family they were not the only ones who had been hit. Nectar has since added extra security measures, and customers are now required to enter a secondary authentication when linking their accounts, Claire Woffenden of Betanews reports. Millions of people are members of the Nectar card scheme. Launched in 2002, over half of Britain's households own a card . Customers currently enjoy a number of perks, including double Nectar points on all Sainsbury’s shopping – online and in store – and two Nectar points per £1 spent on Sainsbury's fuel - plus one point per litre when the customer also swipes their Nectar. Points can also be gained at Homebase, BP and British Gas and redeemed at cinemas, Argos, the Eurostar, Orient Express, Amazon and resorts such as Alton Towers. While millions of loyalty cards are in use in Britain, a recent poll by YouGov Sixth Sense found that 93 per cent of respondents would carry on shopping even if their loyalty cards were stopped. Analysts believe the true value of the cards to supermarkets is for the data they give the chains about our spending habits. Ania Krwawicz, spokeswoman for Nectar's parent company Aimia, said police were also now investigating. She said: 'We became aware of suspicious activity on a small number of Nectar accounts. We informed those customers affected, notified the police and are working with them on this investigation'. MainOnline has contacted eBay for comment. Nectar is the latest in a line of loyalty cards to become a victim of account hacking. In 2013 Tesco customers claimed they'd fallen victim to online fraudsters who had hacked into their Clubcard accounts and taken hundreds of pounds worth of vouchers. At the time, the supermarket giant said it believed fraudsters had stolen people's online IDs and passwords through phishing emails and opportunistically used them on the Clubcard website. The supermarket asked police to investigate claims that dozens of its customers' Clubcard accounts may have fallen victim to the online fraud, with some losing vouchers they accumulated over several years. Nectar card users have also reported that points have been stolen and spent at Argos.","Nectar is the latest card scheme to fall foul of online fraudsters .

"A record 40 per cent of all spending on shoes by women was done online last month . Forget trudging up and down the high street to find that perfect pair of heels. It seems that growing numbers of women would rather avoid the hassle and buy their shoes online. A record 40 per cent of all spending on shoes by women was done online last month, research shows. It is the latest evidence of how the internet has revolutionised our spending habits. The data from the British Retail Consortium found that almost a fifth (18.4 per cent) of all shopping in January for everything except food was done through websites rather than in stores. This is a huge jump of 11.7 per cent from January last year. Online spending rates were particularly high for fashion. More than a quarter of money spent on clothing, or £1 in every £4, was done through websites – even though shoppers cannot try items on before they buy. The rate was even higher for shoes, at more than a third (£1 out of every £3) for the whole population and rising to two fifths (£4 in £10) for women. The BRC suggested that the high numbers of shoes bought online was because ‘the customer experience is generally a better one than in stores’. This could be because stores become overcrowded, particularly during the January sales, or because it can be a lottery as to whether that store has a particular style or size in stock. In contrast, shoppers can browse hundreds of designs on websites from the comfort of their homes and see in an instant whether their size is available. Scroll down for video . Helen Dickinson, BRC director general, said that internet spending in January tends to be high because of online bargains after Christmas, but this year ‘January online sales made up their largest proportion of overall retail sales, only second to November’. She added: ‘As websites continue to improve, including ease of use on mobile devices, with more stock being listed online, it is not a surprise that we loved buying online this January.’ David McCorquodale, head of retail at accountancy firm KPMG, said stores need to invest in their websites and improve the experience for customers. ‘Online sales had a strong January, bolstered by seasonal sales campaigns and targeted marketing drives,’ he said. ‘This side of retailers’ business has a leading role to play in driving overall sales growth, with more shoppers than ever choosing the convenience of buying online. ‘In order to significantly move the dial, substantial spend is needed to improve the robustness of retailers’ systems and improve the experience for customers. Retailers’ online operations warrant the lion’s share of their investment budgets this year.’ Recent research by communications watchdog Ofcom found that Britons spend more money online per head than any other developed country in the world. The figure is almost £2,000 a year – which is £600 more than the next-highest biggest spenders, Australians. Ofcom suggested this was thanks to widespread broadband access in the UK.","Growing numbers of women would rather avoid hassle of high street .

"Last week MPs voted to allow a controversial 'three-parent' IVF technique to prevent babies being born with mitochondrial disease. However, some scientists are worried that genetic tinkering in this way could have serious and unpredictable consequences. Here, Christopher Exley, professor of bioinorganic chemistry at the University of Keele, explains why he's against it. Mitochondrial replacement is a genetic experiment which could have disastrous consequences for generations. In the worst case scenario, it could create 'monsters'. I think the debate has become an emotional one, which the MPs have responded to, rather than about the facts. I think this is a terrible mistake. Some scientists are worried that genetic tinkering could have serious and unpredictable consequences . There is no doubt that the suffering of children with mitochondrial diseases and their parents is truly heartbreaking. The diseases, which are inherited, affect the mitochondria, which are tiny rod-like structures which make energy to power the cell. As a result, the mitochondria either work intermittently, or not at all, meaning that tissues or body organs cannot perform properly. This can lead to children being born with rare and often fatal diseases such as carnitine deficiency, which prevents the body from using fats for energy. Others may develop problems later in life, suffering muscle weakness and extreme tiredness, although the symptoms vary greatly from person to person. With the new IVF mitochondrial procedure - which has so far only been tested on rhesus monkeys - the central part of a fertilised egg, the nucleus which contains the DNA, is put into a donor cell that's had its own nucleus removed but has a healthy mitochondria. But allowing scientists to go ahead with this supposedly neat solution to the problem may actually cause more distress in the long term. We simply have no idea what the risks are. Prof. Exley says researchers are making very serious over-simplifications and assumptions . The 'inventors' of this therapy know very well that they cannot guarantee the outcome of their procedure, either in the very short term - for example, that the new egg will actually develop to a full-term foetus - or in the long term. They have no idea how any 'new' child, conceived in this way, might be influenced in their future health and development. Right now none of this can be known without carrying out many of these procedures and observing the consequences for decades. The researchers are saying it is essentially fine to remove the nucleus from a fertilised egg and put it into a donor egg. (The process can also be carried out before fertilisation.) But that is a very serious over-simplification and they are making a lot of assumptions. What is unknown is the role played by the mother's mitochondria in the development of a fertilised human egg. The assumption being made is that their only role is one of energy supply. The researchers imply that mitochondria are nothing more than 'batteries' which you can pop in and out at will. As lead researcher, Professor Doug Turner, of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research, has said: 'The way people think about them are as little power stations or little batteries that produce the energy that our cells need to work.' Our understanding of how mitochondria work  is not sufficiently advanced . I think this is misleading and has skewed the debate. As a biologist, I know that mitochondria are far more than batteries. Mitochondria are an essential part of the whole cell. Our understanding of how they work and influence the development of the embryo is not sufficiently advanced to know for sure. What we do know is this. The nucleus, which carries the genetic material, the DNA, floats in a sea of fluid called cytoplasm, which contains little fragments called mitochondria. These mitochondria metabolise nutrients in the presence of oxygen and create energy which powers the cell. Depending on where the cell is in the body, it may contain one mitochondrion or hundreds of mitochondria. A brain cell, for example, needs a lot of energy to function properly and needs lots more mitochondria than a fat cell. Only red blood cells have no mitochondria at all. In the process of creating energy, mitochondria create many byproducts, including chemicals called reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. These chemicals pass through the cytoplasm and into the nucleus where they have a signalling role, telling the nucleus to do certain things, even possibly affecting the DNA that determines traits in a new baby. We are just starting to learn more about the huge importance of mitochondria in the entire cell. So, although we still only know the tip of the iceberg about how mitochondria influence the nucleus, it looks likely the mitochondria in your cells play a role in the development of an embryo. Those mitochondria from the third person will be pressing all kinds of buttons on the DNA codes, just like a typist on a word processor. Depending on what keys are pressed, you get different combinations of letters, words and sentences. Who is to say that when the nucleus is taken from the fertilised egg and placed into a foreign environment (the donor egg without its own nucleus), that this 'cuckoo nucleus' will develop in an identical manner in its new home? The donor mitochondria could start interacting with the parental DNA and cause havoc. It is wrong to assume the genetic material of the nucleus will have the overriding influence upon the subsequent development of the foetus. It totally ignores a role for not only mitochondria in every human cell, but everything present in the original fertilised egg. It makes the assumption that the genetic material of the cuckoo nucleus will not be influenced in any way by it being in a new home. Once this technique is allowed to go ahead, there is no going back. People born with three parents will have children themselves and the consequences may only reveal themselves decades down the line. How many cuckoo foetuses are we prepared to abort, because they are found to be incompatible with life in the womb, to produce one cuckoo child? How many cuckoo children are we prepared to bring into society before we can be certain that this procedure is safe and has not simply replaced one child with a terrible disease with another child or person with something which could conceivably be worse? I strongly oppose this procedure on the basis that it is scientific experiment, not a therapy. Childless myself, and not through choice, I understand the desire to have a family of one's own, but I am absolutely certain that it is better for a small number of people to learn to live with childlessness or adopt, than it is for this experiment to be given the go-ahead.

"Jon Krakauer will release Missoula: Rape and the Justice System In a College Town on April 21 . For his next book, Jon Krakauer looked into a series of campus rapes at the University of Montana after he learned that a close family friend had been raped by a man she trusted. Mr Krakauer announced Monday that he would release 'Missoula: Rape and the Justice System In a College Town' on April 21. The best-selling author says that the story 'makes clear why rape is so prevalent on American campuses, and why rape victims are so reluctant to report assault'. He has previously written narrative non-fiction about topical issues, including a biography of football player and soldier Pat Tillman. The book's release in April follows several years where sexual assaults and how they are handled by universities have gotten increased attention. The Department of Justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the Missoula police between January 2008 and May 2012, according to Mr Krakauer's website. The Colorado-based journalist says the new book 'chronicles the searing experiences of several women in Missoula' with both the police system and their university. The book purportedly tells how one district attorney testified for an alleged rapist during university proceedings against him. She later left the prosecutor's office, becoming an attorney for the university's star football player who was accused on rape. The Department of Justice began an investigation into Missoula County in May 2012 after receiving complaints about the way officials handled rapes reported by University of Montana students. A June 2014 agreement ended the investigation, with the county agreeing to training and special prosecutors for sexual assault cases. The university itself has created a small sexual assault prevention department last year with a coordinator and three interns, according to the Montana Kaimin. The Department of Justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the Missoula police between January 2008 and May 2012 . While Mr Krakauer's story focuses on Montana, the book's scope is more global. Missoula is described as 'a typical college town' and Mr Krakauer's website said that rape victims are 'deserving of compassion from society and fairness from a justice system that is clearly broken'. Mr Krakauer decided to write the book 'after learning that a young woman with whom he and his wife have a close relationship suffered intensely in secret for many years after she was raped by a man she trusted,' according to USA Today. Sexual assault and rape have become issues at campuses across the country, with victims speaking out against the way that universities dealt with their allegations. Emma Sulkowicz at Columbia University attended the State of the Union with New York Senator Kristen Gillbrand after carrying a mattress around to classes in protest against her alleged attacker's continued presence on campus. Mr Krakauer, pictured speaking in 2009, is the best selling author of works such as Into Thin Air and Into the Wild . President Obama sent a pre-recorded message to the Grammys on Sunday urging artists to advocate against sexual and domestic violence. Ninety-four colleges and universities were under investigation by the Department of Justice for their handling of sexual assault cases as of the beginning of this year. Mr Krakauer's book says that it 'cuts through the abstract ideological debate about campus rape'. The writer's other works include Into the Wild, Under the Banner of Heaven and Into Thin Air, for which he was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Publisher Doubleday plans a first printing of 500,000 copies for the new book.","Author of 'Into the Wild' spoke with rape victims in Missoula, Montana .

Bennett, Gronkowski, and Hoomanawanui were fined for striking an opponent. Appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live the day after the game, Gronkowski made light of the incident, feigning ignorance and appealing to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell not to punish him. 'Roger, that wasn't me,' Gronkowski joked. 'Don't fine me.' ESPN reports that Irvin tweeted an apology for the fight the day after the game, saying things 'got out of hand.' 'I want to apologize to all of the younger kids for my actions last night,' Irvin wrote. 'I was trying to protect my brother.'

"Acrimony between groups supporting Hillary Clinton's almost certain presidential run spilled over today, with Media Matters founder David Brock suddenly resigning from the board of a super PAC backing the former first lady. Brock allegedly sent the co-chairs of Priorities USA Action a scathing letter today accusing the group of participating in 'an orchestrated political hit job' on his own pro-Clinton organizations, according to Politico. In addition to Media Matters, an left-wing organization that exposes conservative media bias, Brock is responsible for the formation of American Bridge, a super PAC dedicated to electing Democrats, and Correct the Record, an association housed within American Bridge that focuses on rapid responses to attacks on Clinton. David Brock, the founder of the liberal media watchdog Media Matters for America, a group whose mission is to expose mis- and disinformation from the right, allegedly sent the co-chairs of a pro-Hillary group a scathing letter today accusing them of 'an orchestrated political hit job' on his own Clinton-aligned organizations . An unsteady alliance to begin with, Brock's blow up highlighted additional cracks in the network of groups serving as Clinton's surrogate presidential campaign. Previous accounts from Democratic operatives with knowledge of the organizations' communications with one another exposed animosity between Priorities and Ready for Hillary, a grassroots group that primarily amasses names and information on potential Hillary voters. Bickering between the two groups over turf grew so heated, Politico said in a January 2014 report, that a top Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, and other longtime Clinton allies, including former Bill Clinton Chief of Staff and Think Progress founder John Podesta, were asked to step in. After aborting a plan to shutter Ready for Hillary's operations, the organizations eventually agreed that Priorities would focus on raising money from big donors - who can funnel the group unlimited amounts of money per federal election law - and Ready for Hillary would stick to volunteer recruitment and data collection. A New York Times article published last week that took a critical tone to the fundraising efforts of Media Matters, American Bridge and Ready for Hillary - all of whom use the same fundraiser, Mary Pat Bonner, and offer her firm a generous commission - sent the delicate coalition into a tailspin once again. Politico reports that Brock responded to unflattering review of his group's fundraising practices by resigning from Priorities USA Action and sending its co-chairs, former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm and Obama 2012 campaign manager Jim Messina, a nasty letter pointing to their organization as a source of information for the New York Times piece. In the letter Brock allegedly contended that Priorities had engaged in a 'serious breach of trust between organizations that are supposed to work together toward common ends.' The situation has 'created an untenable situation that leaves me no choice but to resign my position,' he reportedly wrote. Brock is also said to have claimed that 'current and former Priorities officials were behind this specious and malicious attack on the integrity of these critical organizations.' Former Secretary of State Hillary  Clinton takes questions from John Podesta, a former chief of staff to her husband, during a September 2014 Q and A. His next act will likely be steering Clinton's 2016 campaign. Already, he's been tapped by groups backing Clinton that just can't seem to get along as a go-between . A senior adviser for Ready for Hillary told Politico his group did not harbor the same suspicions and would maintain a friendly association with the super PAC. 'We have worked with them for almost two years. We continue to work with them. We all do very different things, so there’s not a lot of overlap,' said Craig Smith. A spokesman for Priorities denied the allegations to the publication. 'Priorities USA Action and allied organizations demonstrated a clear ability to work together effectively in 2012 and we look to replicate that success again in 2016,' he said. Clinton is expected to formally join the 2016 horse race late this spring. Numerous reports on the inner workings of her campaign have suggested that she may wait as late as June, however, to make an announcement to give her more time to build her team and iron out her campaign message. The possibility of Clinton waiting to announce her candidacy until so late in the year has troubled some of her allies and Democratic operatives who worry that in assuming an air of inevitability she will again lose the presidency. Another former Barack Obama campaign hand, David Axelrod, who was instrumental in former Illinois senator's victory over Clinton seven years ago, has repeatedly warned Clinton while promoting his memoir Believer: My Forty Years in Politics, that if she uses the same playbook as she did in 2008, she could lose again. Clinton 'needs a very well-conceived message about where she wants to lead the country. If she doesn't have that, then it does become a problem,' he told USA Today during an interview published on Monday. And instead of behaving at the race's frontrunner, she must 'approach this campaign like a challenger...like an insurgent,' Axelrod, now a professor at the University of Chicago, said. 'What she can't rely on, and I don't think she will, is the Clinton name.' He also encouraged her to stay away from the 'visceral connections' she made with voters in 2008 that he said 'terrified' him.","David Brock suddenly resigned from the board of a super PAC backing the former first lady and allegedly sent its co-chairs a scathing letter .

"Guidelines that told millions of people to avoid butter and full-fat milk should never have been introduced, say experts. The startling assertion challenges advice that has been followed by the medical profession for 30 years. The experts say the advice from 1983, aimed at reducing deaths from heart disease, lacked any solid trial evidence to back it up. Scroll down for video . The guidelines – the first of their kind – were introduced when as much as one-fifth of the average British diet was saturated fat such as butter, cream and fattier cuts of meat. Britons were advised by an official dietary committee to cut their fat intake to 30 per cent of total energy and saturated fat intake to 10 per cent, while increasing the amount of carbohydrate they ate. This led food makers to create low-fat spreads, including cholesterol-lowering products, while consumers shunned cheese, milk and cream. However, now some scientists even say the advice is responsible – in part – for the obesity crisis because it encouraged an increase in carbohydrate in our diets. A new review says evidence from trials did not support the advice. It says it is ‘incomprehensible’ that such advice was introduced for 56million Britons in 1983 and 220million Americans six years earlier ‘given the contrary results from a small number of unhealthy men’. Guidelines from the 1980s that told millions to avoid butter and full-fat milk, should never have been introduced and experts say it lacked any solid trial evidence to back it up . ‘The present review concludes that dietary advice not merely needs review; it should not have been introduced.’ However, many public health and nutrition scientists criticised the conclusions of the review in the online BMJ journal Open Heart, saying wider evidence at the time and since has justified the advice and heart deaths have fallen dramatically. The researchers carried out a review of data from trials that would have been available to UK and US regulators at the time. These trials were regarded as the ‘gold standard’ of medical testing. Six relevant trials were found, spanning an average of five years, and involving 2,467 men – most of whom had survived a heart attack or similar event. The trials looked at the relationship between dietary fat, cholesterol, and coronary heart disease. The review found no difference in heart deaths, regardless of whether people were on a high fat or lower fat diet. Professor Iain Broom, of the Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, said there was now mounting evidence against the introduction of low-fat diets to combat heart disease. Carbs are heading the same way as fat in becoming a dirty word, some experts say. Reducing or even eliminating carbs is a key part of several weight-loss diet plans, while many experts are blaming foods such as sugar, bread, pasta and rice for the obesity epidemic. But the NHS recommends eating plenty of potatoes, bread, rice and pasta with some milk and dairy foods, albeit low-fat options. Reducing or even eliminating carbs is a key part of several weight-loss diet plans . By 1991 the official advice in the UK was actually to increase carbohydrates to provide 50 per cent of food energy. This was partly to make up for the ‘energy gap’ caused by cutting the recommended amount of fat in the diet to 35 per cent. But there has been growing disquiet with research suggesting eating more carbs, and sugar, has coincided with rising levels of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In recent decades there has been a huge rise in consumption of refined carbohydrates such as white flour and sugars, white bread, sugary cereals, cakes and biscuits – the ‘hidden’ sugars and fats found in processed foods. Refined carbs are digested quickly, leading to surges in blood sugar levels – a negative effect increasingly linked to health problems. Two studies published in the Annals of Internal Medicine revealed that people looking to avoid obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes should abandon low-fat dieting strategies for a diet that is low in carbohydrates. However many dieticians point out that a balanced diet is important, including fruit and vegetables, and demonising a food group could be counter-productive. They say unrefined or wholegrain carbohydrates such as wholewheat bread, brown rice, wholegrain cereals, beans and legumes are healthy and protective against certain diseases. Yet governments in both the US and UK have ‘practically destroyed the dairy industry by suggesting that butter, cheese and full fat milk increased cardiovascular disease risk, when the contrary is true,’ he said. Professor Broom also said advice to increase carbohydrate consumption to 50 per cent of energy intake was blamed by some experts for an epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes. He said: ‘It is now time for the UK Government to grasp the nettle and stop an uncontrolled experiment, which has gone global and may have had bad outcomes in terms of the obesity explosion and creating a more unhealthy nation with the current idea of “healthy eating”. The review was led by Zoe Harcombe, Institute of Clinical Exercise and Health Science, University of the West of Scotland, Hamilton, and Dr James DiNicolantonio, Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute, Kansas City. In 1983, the country was told to reduce its overall fat consumption to 30 per cent. Official guidelines were changed in 1991 raising this to 35 per cent, but saturated fats remained at 10 per cent. This advice has remained unchanged even though new studies have continued to suggest that there is no association between heart disease and those fats. Britain’s saturated fat consumption is currently around 12 per cent. Last year a US research scientist called for a campaign telling people they had been taken down the ‘wrong dietary road for decades’ in avoiding saturated fat while not being warned about eating too much carbohydrate and sugar. It is not the first time experts have blamed faulty interpretation of studies for creating a ‘myth’ around the role played by saturated fat in heart disease. Researchers last year conducted a ‘meta-analysis’ of data from 72 studies involving more than 600,000 participants from 18 countries. It is a statistically powerful technique to reveal trends that may be masked in individual small studies, but which become obvious when they are amalgamated. A key finding was that total saturated fat, whether measured in the diet or the bloodstream, showed no association with heart disease. But cardiologist Dr Rahul Bahl, of the Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust, also writing in Open Heart, said: ‘There is certainly a strong argument that an over-reliance in public health on saturated fat as the main dietary villain for cardiovascular disease has distracted from the risks posed by other nutrients, such as carbohydrates. ‘Yet replacing one caricature with another does not feel like a solution.’ Professor Tom Sanders, of King’s College London, said in the 1970-80s the UK and other Western countries were facing an epidemic of coronary heart disease. He said: ‘It was effectively a policy choice between sitting on the fence and doing nothing or opting to follow what the evidence suggested – that cutting total fat intake would help prevent obesity and reducing saturated fat would lower blood cholesterol. Anyway it seems to have turned out okay… between 1997 and 2007/8 cardiovascular disease mortality under the age of 75 years fell by 55 per cent.’","Dietary advice from 1983 ordered cut of dairy fats and increase of carbs .

"Beleaguered NBC anchor Brian Williams could have exaggerated another near-death story involving himself - this time from a stint covering Israel's 2006 war with Hezbollah. Williams seemingly embellished an account of a helicopter ride with Israeli Defense Force officials to imply he was almost hit by a rocket, when in fact he was nowhere near enemy fire. The potentially pumped-up claims came a little more than a year after the event, when Williams recounted a slew of now-doubtful anecdotes about his time in the midst of mortal danger. Scroll down for video . Rockets 'just underneath': Williams said he was 'lucky to survive' this helicopter flight, and claimed rockets were just underneath the vehicle . Looking for danger: Williams implied he was in danger during the 2006 flight near Haifa, Israel - but in an NBC report he wrote, he mentioned only ground operations beneath them, and a rocket fired from six miles away . It came amid claims that NBC bosses had been told about Williams' alleged track record of puffing up stories, and were baffled by the habit. Williams told a student reporter he was 'lucky to survive' the helicopter ride, organized by the Israeli military to give his NBC news crew an aerial perspective of the conflict, near the city of Haifa. In a recorded interview ahead of a speaking engagement at Fairfield University, Connecticut, he told how rockets whizzed by 'just underneath' the Blackhawk he was riding in with an Israeli general. However, a broadcast segment he himself filmed that day makes no mention of being inches from death, only mentioning plumes of smoke and a rocket he saw fired six miles away. If you squint: This footage, shot from the chopper, shows distant rocket fire over Israel. Williams's past reports are under intense scrutiny since he admitted embellishing an anecdote from his time in Iraq . In a Youtube video, he told a report for the student-run News 64 channel: 'I have been very lucky to survive a few things. I tend to forget the war with Hezbollah in Israel a few years back. 'There were Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in.' However, the fleeting reference does not tally with his own NBC report, dated July 18, 2006. There he states that the chopper was 1,500ft in the air, and that the four-star general on board with him mentioned that there was ground-based activity directly below them. He continued: 'Then, I noticed something out the window. From a distance of six miles, I witnessed a rocket launch. 'A rising trail of smoke, then a second rocket launch, an orange flash and more smoke — as a rocket heads off toward Israel.' He does not suggest that the rocket came anywhere near him. The seemingly conflicting accounts, uncovered by the Washington Post, emerged after Williams backed out of anchoring NBC's flagship Nightly News show. It came after it was claimed that NBC executives were tipped off about Williams's behavior, but did not know how to rein him in. On the scene: Williams is pictured above posing with a soldier in Iraq. Veterans of that war called him out on his overblown anecdotes . New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote that news bosses were told last year his claims sometimes did not stack up, and that his tendency to exaggerate had become 'a joke' among NBC staffers. Over the weekend Williams backed off from the anchor's chair for an unspecified length of time after a firestorm over another helicopter anecdote he had been repeating for years - this time in Iraq. Williams issued an on-air apology after saying he was on board a helicopter which was downed after being hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, when he was in fact on a different one. Some days later, after intense criticism of that anecdote and others, he withdrew from presenting the news. He said: 'In the midst of a career spent covering and consuming news, it has become painfully apparent to me that I am presently too much a part of the news, due to my actions. 'As Managing Editor of NBC Nightly News, I have decided to take myself off of my daily broadcast for the next several days... 'Upon my return, I will continue my career-long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us.' In the Fairfield interview, Williams also grabs the opportunity to give his Iraqi anecdote an outing. Currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in Iraq, a number of Williams' other seemingly outlandish claims are currently coming under increased scrutiny . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies. In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone ‘stuck a .38-caliber in my face.’ Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an army Chinook during the Iraq War in 2003. Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on air apology. ‘Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor,’ he wrote on Facebook. Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the floodwaters and that his hotel was ‘overrun’ with gangs, have been called into question by others who were there. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled ‘Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in.’ In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described a helicopter under fire a distance away. Boston, 2006 . A navy vet has accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the armed forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update. Backed off: Williams, seen above in his broadcast from Friday, has backed off from the anchor's chair since criticism mounted . He said: 'A few years before that you go back to Iraq and I looked down the tube of an RPG that had been fired at us and it hit the chopper in front of ours. 'And I'm so fortunate to be sitting here.' Though this version of the story does not place Williams inside the under-fire vehicle, it does imply that he was right next to the action. Veterans who were riding in the chopper, which managed to land after the RPG round did not explode, have since said Williams's helicopter was not following them, and was nothing to do with their mission. In fact, they said, he was around half an hour behind, and only found out about the brush with death after he had landed.","Under-fire NBC anchor seemingly embellished war story from 2006 .

"An Australian teenager will get the chance to showcase her homemade jewellery to Hollywood's biggest stars after she was invited to attend this year's Academy Awards. Tiona Pemberton, from Toowoomba in south-east Queensland, will fly to Los Angeles next Thursday and take her place in the Oscars' gift suite where celebrities pick up freebies before the awards ceremony and pose with products. The 19-year-old can then use the photographs of famous people modelling her jewellery - including necklaces, headpieces, rings and earrings - for promotion purposes. Scroll down for video . Tiona Pemerton (pictured), 19, has designed a line of jewellery under the brand of Mallow and Thyme . The Toowoomba university student's creations have been worn by stars like Vanessa Hudgens . When Pemberton was first approached by Academy Award organisers she thought it was a joke. 'Initially I was completely in shock, bewildered and excited. I couldn't really believe it and I thought it was set up,' the Queensland University of Technology student told Daily Mail Australia. 'After a day full of research and talking to people who had gone to past events, it was not a sham… and [they said it was] one of the greatest experiences. 'You get to talk a lot and interact with a lot of celebrities... it can't be anything other than a great experience.' Pemberton has the chance to showcase her work to Hollywood stars in the gifts suite before the Oscars . Pemberton already has a short list of stars she would love to get an audience with. 'At the start, I thought Snoop Dogg because he's an interesting character and has a lot of contacts,' she said. 'But I'm now leaning more towards Jennifer Lawrence because she seems like a lovely, lovely person.' She started up the jewellery line to make money while she studied nutrition at Brisbane's Queensland University of Technology when she was 18 . Three months after she started the business, Pemberton was contacted by a Hollywood stylist who managed the wardrobes of Vanessa Hudgens, Ashlee Simpson and Evan Ross . The teenager never thought her jewellery would take off and she saw it as more of a way to make money while she studied nutrition at university. 'I started officially making jewellery when I was five years old and string plastic beads,' Pemberton said. 'Last year I had two people ask me why I wasn't working at uni. 'It was a way for me to have a hobby and get some money in when I was 18. 'Almost instantly we had people buying from overseas, from the US and the UK. I put it down to social media, it had a great deal to do with that.' Pemberton will be heading to Los Angeles next Thursday for next Saturday's Oscars ceremony . She started making jewellery from as young as five by stringing plastic beads together . Prices of Pemberton's jewellery range from $16 to $299 and are made from materials like quartz and silver . Just three months after the inception of her brand Mallow and Thyme, a Hollywood stylist found out about the jewellery on Instagram and emailed to see if she could get hands on the 19-year-old's creations. Since then, her jewellery has been worn by actress Vanessa Hudgens, singer Ashlee Simpson and her husband Evan Ross, who is the son of music legend Diana Ross. Prices of Pemberton's jewellery range from $16 to $299 and are made from materials like quartz and silver. Pemberton also credits her success to the support of her friends and family. 'My mum was so cute about it [when she found out about the Oscars]. She’s really chuffed. When I told [my parents] the news and they couldn't believe it,' she said. 'I'm grateful for all the positive support and the kind words.'","Jewellery maker Tiona Pemberton, 19, is from Toowoomba in Queensland .

"Captured on a small cine-camera as it plays across the ranks of 17 approaching cannibal war canoes, the image is fleeting but unmistakable. Among the massed ranks of dark-skinned headhunter tribesmen heading around the bend of a New Guinea river is a naked and bearded white-skinned man, his face partly covered in war paint as he paddles furiously. The appearance of a white face among a throng of Papuan cannibals would be astonishing at the best of times. But in the circumstances in which this footage was shot, it is potentially mind-boggling. A 'white tribesman' was seen with a a group of Papuan cannibals in 1969, eight years after Michael Rockefeller mysteriously disappeared in a similar area . For the impressive scene was filmed in 1969 close to the spot where, eight years earlier, a scion of the Rockefeller dynasty — the richest, most powerful family in U.S. history — had gone missing, sparking the biggest hunt ever launched in the South Pacific. Since 23-year-old Michael Rockefeller disappeared during a trip to collect primitive art from one of the remotest corners of the planet, rumours swirled about his fate. The official explanation advanced by the former colony’s Dutch rulers was that he drowned after he tried to swim to shore from his capsized boat. Others insisted he met a more horrible fate — killed and eaten by cannibals seeking revenge on white men for a Dutch attack on their village. Now, a documentary made by Fraser Heston, son of actor Charlton Heston, has thrown the focus on this extraordinary story once more. And, tantalisingly, newly unearthed film footage of the mysterious white canoeist suggests an astonishing possibility. Instead of being killed and eaten, did the Harvard-educated American reject his civilised past and join a tribe of cannibals? The riddle started in 1961 when the young graduate swapped his entitled Manhattan life for the privations of Dutch New Guinea. Now part of the Indonesian province of Papua, it was one of the wildest, most remote places on Earth, populated by people largely stuck in the Stone Age. A keen anthropologist, Rockefeller wanted to supply his father Nelson — governor of New York and later Gerald Ford’s Vice-President — with exhibits for a museum of primitive art he had just founded. Occupying 10,000 square miles of jungle swamp on the southern coast of the Dutch colony, the Asmat tribes were ferocious headhunters, but they also made stunning wooden sculptures (rubbed with the blood of those they killed) as well as hauntingly beautiful decorated skulls. These they collected from tribal foes, having eaten their brains in a sacred ritual they believed would give them the dead men’s power. Their bloodthirsty way of life revolved around endless revenge attacks against neighbouring villages. Each time a tribe member was killed, he had to be avenged by taking the skull of an enemy — whether man, woman or child. Mystery: Rockefeller was never seen again after attempting to swim to shore after his boat capsized . Whites were generally safe from this tribal war, and Rockefeller spent six months there, writing home about the amazing art he had acquired and his fascination with Asmat culture. His father later said his restless son had never been happier. But things were about to change for ever. On November 17, 1961, Rockefeller was travelling up the coast — a region of dense rainforest, mangrove swamp and crocodile-infested mudflats known as the Land of Lapping Death — when his small catamaran capsized in rough seas. Two teenage native guides immediately swam towards shore — around nine miles — to get help. Following a very uncomfortable night spent clinging to the submerged craft, an impatient Rockefeller stripped to his underpants, strapped together two jerry cans for buoyancy and struck out for land, telling his companion, a Dutch anthropologist: ‘I think I can make it.’ They were the last words he is known to have uttered. The Dutchman was picked up the next day, but his companion was never seen again. The hunt was exhaustive. His father chartered a Boeing 707 and flew a media army out to the region. Thousands of locals joined a search involving dozens of ships, planes and helicopters. But no trace was ever found, and after ten days his devastated father gave up. Dutch officials presumed that Rockefeller had drowned. But he had been a strong swimmer, the sea was calm, the tide was pushing him to shore and the local sharks weren’t man-eaters. Rumours persisted that he had reached land. Then, in 1968, New York magazine editor Milt Machlin flew out to Papua and launched a months-long search. He discovered a retired Dutch missionary, Cornelius van Kessel, who had been living in the Asmat area when Rockefeller disappeared. The priest told Machlin an extraordinary story: a week after the last searchers gave up, he started hearing tribal rumours that the American had been caught and killed. The reason, he claimed, was that three years before Rockefeller disappeared, a Dutch police patrol had come to a village called Otsjanep to sort out a tribal headhunting war. Fearing they were about to be attacked, the police opened fire, killing five village leaders. By their sacred code, the tribe had to have revenge and take a head — a white man’s head like that of the patrol’s Dutch leader. That was easier said than done. Then, one day, a group of some 50 Otsjanep men were returning home from a trading trip when they finally got their chance: a white man, exhausted and unarmed, swam towards their canoes just offshore. One of the tribesmen was said to have stabbed him fatally with a 10ft fishing spear, before they hauled him into a boat and took him to shore, where they chopped him up, cooked him and ate him. The priest said the tribesmen admitted they had killed him as revenge for the police raid. Dutch officials disputed the story, saying that missionaries were unreliable. Besides, sneered one sceptic, an even more bizarre story had leaked out, that Rockefeller was still alive, and ‘kept as a white idol by a tribe near the coast’. So what was the truth? The official explanation is that Rockefeller drowned, while some say he made it to shore only to be killed and eaten by the cannibal tribe . Last year, a new book revealed that two Dutch missionaries had sent detailed reports of the murder to the colonial government and the Catholic church, even identifying which headhunter had kept parts of the American’s skeleton. Though magazine editor Milt Machlin favoured the theory that Rockefeller had been killed and eaten, he didn’t dismiss the possibility he had survived. White men were regarded as wielders of powerful magic by Pacific tribesmen. When the Allies left the region after Japan’s 1945 surrender and stopped dropping air supplies — or cargo — so-called ‘cargo cults’ sprung up on islands such as Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu. The tribes venerated the Western goods — including canned food, mass-produced clothing, weapons and medicine — that had so drastically altered their lives, and built mock landing strips and lit signal fires in the expectation the Westerners would return. The son of an immensely powerful white man could have made a strong magic totem for any tribe if he conveyed to them who he was. Could the story about Rockefeller’s murder have been a cover-up, hiding an even more extraordinary fate? Milt Machlin didn’t have a permit to travel in the Asmet region, so he sent photographer Malcolm Kirk. It was Kirk who shot the footage of the white-skinned canoeist, but then Machlin allowed it to languish for more than 40 years in an American warehouse, until documentary-maker Fraser Heston found it. Heston’s documentary is called The Search For Michael Rockefeller. He was researching a screenplay based on Milt Machlin’s book about Rockefeller’s disappearance when he found around 15 reels of uncut film and sound tapes. It is not clear why it had been gathering dust in a New England vault, but it is believed Machlin (who died in 2004) felt he didn’t have enough footage for a documentary. Malcolm Kirk told me yesterday that he did not believe the mystery man was Rockefeller, though he hadn’t noticed him at the time. ‘I can’t say I was particularly aware of a light-skinned figure in one of the canoes, but I do recall coming across a reference to an albino male when I glanced through my journal a few weeks ago,’ he said. While he, too, favours the cannibal theory, Fraser Heston is not so sure that the white canoeist can be automatically dismissed. ‘This shot of a bearded, light-skinned Caucasian paddling in a canoe full of naked Asmat warriors begs more questions than it answers,’ he says in his documentary, noting that the Asmat don’t wear beards. ‘The resemblance to Michael Rockefeller, an accomplished canoeist who wore a beard, is obvious.’ And if it wasn’t Rockefeller — ‘assimilated into the Asmat’s cannibal culture in the preceding seven years’, as Heston suggests — who was it? In this outlandish tale, where anything seems possible, it is not an unreasonable question.","Michael Rockefeller went missing in Papua New Guinea back in 1961 .

"Near Death Experience:  Mary Neal (photographed) claims that she died and went to heaven where she was forewarned of her son's death . A Wyoming surgeon claims that she experienced heaven and was  forewarned of her son's tragic death during a near-death experience. On June 21, 2009, Dr. Mary Neal, of Wyoming, learned that her son, Willie, was in an accident. The 19-year-old was roller skiing when he was hit from behind by a distracted driver in a vehicle and killed, Bangor Daily News reports. That was the day Neal finished the memoir about her own near-death experience, one in which she  claims she was warned about her son's death a decade earlier. In 1999, Neal, an orthopedic spine surgeon, was kayaking in southern Chile with her husband, Bill, and their friends when she became pinned under a waterfall where she was trapped for 12 minutes, according to the Huffington Post. Tom Long, a friend and EMT who was with Neal when she drowned, spoke with Jonas Elrod on 'In Deep Shift with Jonas Elrod,' a series on the Oprah Winfrey Network, and told Elrod that after 90 seconds under water, Neal couldn't have been breathing anymore. 'I don't know what happened,' Long said. 'We're 24 minutes into it; she's dead. Blue, waxy, no heartbeat, no breathing, cold-to-the-touch dead.' Miraculously, the mother-of-three was able to be resuscitated and suffered no brain damage, the Post reports. After going without oxygen for nearly 30 minutes, Neal regained consciousness, and when she did, she had a story to tell: she had gone to heaven. 'I could feel my spirit peeling away from my body,' Neal said, describing her time under the water. 'I rose up and out of the water and I was immediately greeted by a group of people, beings, spirits.' Husband: Neal said she was kayaking with her husband, Bill (left), and friends in southern Chile when she was pinned beneath a waterfall for 12 minutes . Son: Neal said that during her time in heaven, she was warned about the future death of her oldest son, Willie (photographed) Neal told Elrod that the 'spirits' were overjoyed as they welcomed her. She equated it to the feeling of returning home after a long voyage. In the episode, Elrod asked what heaven was like and she said there was no other earthly equivalent. 'The senses were different. I mean the beauty was incredibly intense..' Neal said. Neal did not want to leave, she told Elrod, but the spirits, who she said had heads, arms, legs, and were wearing robes, told her that it wasn't her time, and that she had to go back because she had work to do -- she was told that she was to share her experience with people. Warning: Neal said that the spirits did not tell her the date or the time it would happen, but warned her of Willie's death . Willie: On June 21, 2009, Willie, 19,  died after a distracted driver struck him from behind while he was roller skiing . Neal said the spirits then reunited her with her body and she wrote in her memoir 'To Heaven and Back' that the spirits warned her of a future tragedy. 'They did tell me about the future death of my oldest son,' she said in the episode. 'They didn't tell me the date or the time, but it was very clear that would be happening.' And ten years later it did. 'I woke up every day hoping the plan for my son's life would change,' Neal said. Overjoyed: Neal said that the 'spirits' were overjoyed as they welcomed her. She equated it to the feeling of returning home after a long voyage . She said that she didn't share the news with her husband at the time because 'it was a burden.' On the anniversary of his death, Neal wrote about her son in a post on her Facebook page. She wrote that she is grateful for the time she spent with Willie, who would be about 24 or 25 now. 'Your smile, your spirit, and your light continue to permeate the darkness...' she wrote. 'Thank you for the little ways in which you have shown us you are still around.' Neal, a woman of science, was caught between two conflicting ideas. She said she wondered if the situation could be explained scientifically, or if it was a miracle, according to the episode. Children: Neal once had four children, (from left to right) Betsy, Peter, Willie, and Eliot Neal . Mother-of-Three: Willie was the oldest of Neal's children, he died in 2009 (photographed from left to right is Betsy, Peter, and Eliot Neal) She said she studied dreams, hallucinations, and what happens when the brain dies. Neal said she needed to figure out what she experienced. 'We want to find an explanation that we can understand, other than something that is divine,' Neal told Elrod. 'I am a very concrete thinker, I'm not fanciful, I don't exaggerate. At the end my conclusion was that, no, it really was beyond science. 'I absolutely know what I know. It was pretty absolute for me.' Memoir: In 2012, Neal released her memoir, 'To Heaven and Back: A Doctor's Extraordinary Account of Her Death, Heaven, Angels, and Life Again: A True Story'","Dr. Mary Neal, of Wyoming, claims that in a near-death experience, not only did she experience heaven, but she was also forewarned of her son's tragic death .

"The ancient Incas were among the first victims of man-made greenhouse gases when Spanish Conquistadors forced them to mine silver at Potosi 240 years before the Industrial Revolution, it was claimed today. The earliest evidence of large-scale human-produced greenhouse gases in South America was found encased in ice in the Andes. In the 16th century during its conquest of South America the Spanish forced Incas to work in the mountaintop mines of Potosí in what is now Bolivia - then the largest source of silver in the world. The earliest evidence of large-scale human-produced greenhouse gases in South America was found encased in ice in the Andes. The samples were cut from ice that formed over 1,200 years ago as snow settled on the Peruvian Andes. Layer by layer it captured chemicals from the air during wet and dry seasons for all those years. The indigenous population already knew how to refine the metal but in 1572 the Spanish introduced a new technology that boosted production many times over and sent thick clouds of lead dust rising over the Andes for the first time in history. Winds carried some of that pollution 500 miles northwest into Peru where tiny remnants of it settled on the Quelccaya Ice Cap. There it stayed - buried under hundreds of years of snow and ice - until researchers from Ohio State University found it in 2003. Now in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences they report the discovery of a layer within an ice core that dates to the Spanish conquest, contains bits of lead and bears the chemical signature of the silver mines of Potosí. The core makes Quelccaya one of only a few select sites on the planet where the pre-industrial human impact on air quality can be studied today. Dr Paolo Gabrielli said: 'This evidence supports the idea human impact on the environment was widespread even before the industrial revolution.' Prof Lonnie Thompson said the find is 'another keyhole into the past of human activity in that part of the world' and believes further investigation could help us better understand the fate of pollution circulating in the atmosphere today. The samples were cut from ice that formed over 1,200 years ago as snow settled on the Peruvian Andes. Layer by layer it captured chemicals from the air during wet and dry seasons for all those years. The researchers found a spike in bismuth - a chemical by-product of mining metals - around 148O when the Inca Empire was expanding. And around 154O less than a decade after the beginning of Spanish colonisation in South America trace element concentrations of several metals - including lead- rose. The refining process the Spanish introduced involved grinding silver ore - which contains much more lead than silver - into powder before mixing it with mercury in a process called amalgamation. So atmospheric pollution from silver production would chiefly contain traces of lead particulates. The steeple of the church of the town Potosi is seen at the Uribante-Caparo water reservoir . While the Incas had long extracted silver, a new processing method introduced by the Spanish in 1572 greatly increased production even as it belched lead dust and other pollutants into the atmosphere. The pollution blew over the entire region, including the Quelccaya Ice Cap some 500 miles (800 km) northwest in southern Peru. The Spanish refining process involved pulverizing silver ore, containing both lead and silver, into powder, which sent metallic dust into the atmosphere. The powder was mixed with mercury. The silver was separated by heating the mixture to allow the mercury to evaporate. Starting just before 16OO the Quelccaya ice began capturing much larger quantities of these elements - and the high amounts persisted until the early 18OOs when South American countries declared independence from Spain. To pin down where the pollution came from the researchers compared their data with those from a peat bog in Chile and from sedimentary lake records from regions including Potosí and other mines throughout Bolivia and Peru. These latter sites would have captured the pollution generated in their local area during that time. The chemical signatures in the Quelccaya ice suggests most of the pollution likely came from Potosi - where the Spanish produced the vast majority of silver. Even in their highest concentrations, the elements entrapped in the ice are not visible to the naked eye and can be detected only through chemical analyses. The section of core containing them has the translucent white appearance of perfectly clean ice. An independent miner leaves the Candelaria zinc-tin mine pulling a two-tons wagon loaded with poorly concentrated mineral at the famous Cerro Rico mountain in Potosi, Bolivia- where in 1572 the Spanish introduced a new technology that boosted production - but created huge amounts of pollutrton . Dr Gabrielli said: 'The fact we can detect pollution in ice from a pristine high altitude location is indicative of the continental significance of this deposition. Only a significant source of pollution could travel so far, and affect the chemistry of the snow on a remote place like Quelccaya.' Ice cores in Greenland contain traces of lead from as far back as the 5th century BC which were sent airborne by smelting in the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. This latest ice core from Quelccaya shows that humans generated substantial pollution in the 16th century. Still the 2Oth century produced more pollution than any other time in human history. International geological governing bodies are currently considering whether to officially call our current epoch the Anthropocene, or 'Age of Humans,' to designate the span of time that humans have been changing the environment. The researchers hope the Quelccaya core will inform that debate.","Pollution created by silver mining 240 years before Industrial Revolution .

"The spotlight in the HSBC affair last night fell on links between multi-millionaire Richard Caring and Tina Green – the wife of his close friend and billionaire clothing magnate Sir Philip Green. Socialite Mr Caring – who owns a string of London restaurants including The Ivy and the nightclub Annabel’s – visited a Geneva branch of the bank and withdrew £2.25million in cash. The transaction took place in September 2005 and was not flagged up by the lender. Scroll down for video . Friends: Sir Philip Green, Richard Caring, his wife Jackie Caring and Bill Clinton at a charity event in 2005. A spokesman for Sir Philip strongly denied his wife Tina had any link to Swiss HSBC accounts . The bank recorded only that Mr Caring planned to deposit the money ‘in a new a/c (account) with a separate institution in Geneva’. He last night insisted the money was for a business transaction with people who did not want to use HSBC. But according to bank files seen by the BBC’s Panorama and The Guardian, funds in the Swiss account originated from accounts in the tax haven of Monaco. These accounts, it is alleged, were controlled by Mr Caring but were held ‘in trust’ under the name of Tina Green, Sir Philip’s wife. However, a spokesman for Sir Philip said the allegations about his wife were untrue, adding: ‘No such account exists, or ever has done in the past.’ Denial: A spokesman for Sir Philip, pictured with his wife Tina, said: 'There are a number of serious inaccuracies and mistakes in the Guardian story' Leaked records from HSBC note that ‘RC goes to great lengths to maintain discretion’, and in July 2005, he had fallen out with the bank over a ‘currency shortfall’ on one account. After a ‘lengthy and challenging conversation’, the bank had been aware Mr Caring could send ‘funds from Monaco at a moment’s notice... However, they would be accompanied by instructions to close the account. He expects us to consider his global relationship.’ In the event, the bank recorded: ‘As we know, until now (Caring) has hesitated from holding the vast majority of his cash assets in his own name, preferring to accept the offer of Mrs Green that she holds them in trust on his behalf.’ The bank also recorded that Mr Caring, 62, held some £65.7million in offshore accounts and was also taking profits from an ‘anonymous’ 22 per cent holding in BHS. Mr Caring, a former Labour and Tory donor, has claimed hereditary ‘non-domiciled’ tax status through his US-born father, an American GI who settled in England after the Second World War. This, it has been suggested, enabled Mr Caring not to disclose the existence of his Swiss or Monaco bank accounts to the UK tax authorities, so he could avoid taxes on capital held abroad. The leaked files also show that Mr Caring used his tax free account to transfer $1million to Bill and Hillary Clinton’s charitable foundation – seemingly in return for the ex-US President’s attendance at a lavish Russian charity ball in 2005. The Guardian reports that HSBC’s notes contain an instruction to ‘transfer [$1m] to Bill Clinton’s Foundation as a contribution following his involvement in the charity function.’ Mr Caring has been friends with Sir Philip for many years and gave him a red Ferrari F430 for his 50th birthday. He once said of his relationship with the tycoon, 62: ‘I speak to him every day. We’re more than friends – I think we’d do anything for each other. We’re like brothers.’ Sir Philip and his wife are worth more than £5billion and split their time between London and a Monaco apartment. Mr Caring’s International Clothing Designs firm still supplies Sir Philip’s Topshop chain. Last month the Daily Mail contacted Sir Philip to ask about rumours he had been listed on the stolen HSBC computer disc as having an offshore account in Geneva. He replied: ‘For the record I have never had a Swiss bank account.’ He did not mention the Monaco account that it is now claimed is controlled by Mr Caring even though it is in the name of Tina Green. Spotlight: HSBC is facing scrutiny after a vast cache of Swiss bank account documents was leaked . Last night Mr Caring told the Mail he was angry at ‘insinuations’ regarding his dealings with HSBC. He insisted he has had ‘non-dom’ status for many years and it was a fact known to the UK tax authorities. ‘The revenue people have always known my non-dom status. I had some £100million in dividends from BHS at one stage and I paid £33million in regard to that matter and the revenue [HMRC] was happy that I didn’t owe a single penny more in tax. ‘The HSBC documents that have been widely referred to by the Guardian and others have been known to [HMRC] since 2010 and have not resulted in any taxable issues. ‘The insinuation that I would or want to evade tax is totally wrong. I have also never bullied the HSBC bank in terms of my dealings with them. Yes, I did withdraw more than £2 million from the bank and that was for a business transaction. ‘I appreciate it was a large amount of money but I was put in that position at the time because the people I was dealing with did not want to use HSBC in a particular transaction. ‘It was a business matter and I have not bullied anyone.’ Last night it emerged that Sir Philip was considering legal action against The Guardian in relation to claims about the HSBC row. A spokesman said: ‘There are a number of serious inaccuracies and mistakes in the Guardian story. People are allowed to have bank accounts abroad and people should ask some basic questions. ‘For instance, if you have a bank account in Switzerland and access to other accounts in that country there why on earth would you transfer funds from somewhere like Monaco. ‘For a number of reasons – including currency conversion – that would not make any sense at all. ‘People writing about the HSBC issue and Swiss bank accounts should be very careful as there has not been any impropriety.’","Focus on links between Richard Caring and Sir Philip Green's wife Tina .

"A woman who traveled 2,000 miles across the country in order to surprise her pregnant sister with a visit just hours before her baby shower has released a video diary of her plan, which also captures the pair's incredibly emotional reunion. Erica Pounds, 22, from Los Angeles, California, and her brother-in-law Perry Johnson, 28, who lives with his wife Felicia in Conway, Arkansas, spent more than a month hatching their plan together in order to ensure pregnant Felicia had the most memorable baby shower ever. 'The idea came from Erica and I, while I was texting her about the upcoming shower and what would make it special,' Perry, whose wife has since given birth to a beautiful baby boy, Perry Jr., told Daily Mail Online. Reunited: Erica Pounds (R), traveled more than 2,000 miles from her home in Los Angeles, California, in order to surprise her pregnant sister Felicia (L), just hours before her baby shower . Sisterly bond: Felicia, 28, was overjoyed when she discovered her younger sibling hiding a large cardboard box on her doorstep, and promptly broke down in tears . 'She originally was not able to make it but found a way to get off from work to be there in Conway which is almost 2,000 miles away. 'We spent about a month and a half planning it.' The video, which begins shortly after Perry has picked his sister-in-law up at the airport, charts every moment of the duo's heartwarming plan, including the additional minutes that they had to wait while Felicia made an impromptu trip to the shops. 'Baby doll, you have no idea what's going on, but it's about to go down,' Perry says to the camera. 'You're about to get a special delivery package - and guess who's in it?' He later adds: 'This is the one day that [Felicia] decides she wants to take some extra time and go to the store and go shopping before our surprise. 'She's ruining our surprise because now we have to wait on Felicia. We love you any way though.' All of that effort most definitely paid off however; the shock and surprise on Felicia's face when she opened the box in which her sister was hiding quickly turned to tears of  joy as she pulled her sister into a tight embrace, sobbing into her shoulder. Surprise! The look of shock on Felicia's face when she first opened the box quickly turned to tears of joy . The best present ever: Erica and Felicia share an incredibly close bond . And, action! The whole experience was captured on camera by Felicia's husband Perry . 'I couldn't believe it,' she admitted to Daily Mail Online. 'It felt surreal and thought I was dreaming. It was the most incredible surprise that has ever happened to me.' The 28-year-old, who gave birth to her four-month-old son Perry Jr. shortly after her baby shower, added that, despite the physical distance between them, she and her sister have always had an incredibly close bond - one which has only been strengthened by the birth of her first child. 'We are very close; she is my best friend and we have been through many ups and downs in our lives,' the new mother added. 'She is one of my confidants and I am very thankful that she is my son’s aunt.'

She got me good on that one.' Perry, who is a singer and a musician - and actually met his wife while auditioning for the X Factor - and Felicia sing in a band together, and he thought it would add even more meaning to the video if he had one of their tracks playing throughout the clip. 'The song is a Fresh Play original called Our Love from our debut album called Unveiled,' he explained. 'I was on American Idol Season 10 and later met my wife on the singing competition called The X-Factor. 'It was pretty much love at first sight.'","Erica Pounds, 22, and her brother-in-law Perry Johnson, 28, spent more than a month planning the surprise for pregnant Felicia, also 28 .

"A new mother who suffered a devastating 19 miscarriages over 14 years has spoken of her joy at finally meeting her miracle baby. Jo Short, 37, had been diagnosed with endometriosis - a gynaecological condition affecting almost two million women in the UK, where womb tissue grows painfully in other areas of the body - but she and her husband Steve were told by eight different medical consultants that this should not be affecting her ability to carry a baby to term. The couple from Newport, Wales, appeared on ITV's Daybreak with their healthy baby Emily-Kate to explain that they successfully conceived her just months after Jo had pioneering surgery. Scroll down for video . Jo and Steve Short appearing on Daybreak with their miracle baby Emily-Kate . Jo Short who gave birth to her baby Emily after suffering from 19 Miscarriges is pictured here with her husband Steve and baby Emily-Kate . 'It's been a real emotional rollercoaster, really quite difficult, but it's been well worth it', said Jo, holding Emily-Kate. 'The challenge was there's limited research into the link between endometriosis and miscarriage. 'The frustration was in being told by eight different consultants that everything was normal and to go away and keep trying.' Steve added: 'The real difficulty is they tell you there is nothing categorically wrong. And every time you roll the dice and you get pregnant you hope something will change but you know deep down it won't.' 'It's been a real emotional rollercoaster, really quite difficult, but it's been well worth it', said Jo . 'The frustration was in being told by eight different consultants that everything was normal and to go away and keep trying' 'It's been a real emotional rollercoaster, really quite difficult, but it's been well worth it' 'Every time you roll the dice and you get pregnant you hope something will change but you know deep down it won't,' said Steve . Jo explained that over the years she had had four laproscopies - a laser procedure that involves sticking a tiny telescope into the body to see what's happening inside and to carry out surgery - each to a depth of 2.5mm. Each session would involve doctors removing parts of the womb tissue from inside her stomach, which would relieve the pain for about a year but still leave Jo miscarrying. Then the couple met Cardiff consultant Richard Penketh who told her about a pioneering surgery being trialled in Canada that involved cutting back deeper than 2.5mm - all the way to healthy tissue. Jo and Steve Short with Dr Sarah Jarvis discussing Jo's operation for endometriosis that helped them successfully conceive baby Emily-Kate . The family are picture perfect and couldn't be happier with baby Emily-Kate . 'The ramifications for other women are huge,' said Dr Sarah Jarvis, who joined the couple on Daybreak. 'One miscarriage is utterly devastating. Endometriosis is a common condition in which small pieces of the womb lining (the endometrium) are found outside the womb. Endometriosis affects around 2 million women in the UK. Most of them are diagnosed between the ages of 25 and 40. Endometriosis is a long-term (chronic) condition that causes painful or heavy periods. It often causes pain in the lower abdomen (tummy), pelvis or lower back. It may also lead to lack of energy, depression and fertility problems. However, the symptoms of endometriosis can vary and some women have few symptoms or no symptoms at all. 'You don't lose a pregnancy, you lose a baby and everything that goes with it. 'As soon as you find out you're pregnant you're dreaming of them getting married! When you're ready to try again is when you're ready for that emotional reattachment. 'A couple who have had three miscarriages are at risk of having more - lots of women have one or two. 'The good news for a woman who's had recurrent miscarriages is that your chances of having a healthy baby are much greater than if you can't get pregnant in the first place. Getting pregnant in the first place is often a huge issue. 'This won't help everyone, but there may be women out there for whom it does.'","Jo and Steve Short from Newport, Wales, finally had baby Emily-Kate .

"It was an inauspicious place to carry out a crime. But perhaps the Romanian thieves who chose to steal coins from the moat around the Tower of London were unaware of its bloody place in English history. The four offenders had clambered over a barrier and jumped into the moat in front of Traitors’ Gate, through which many prisoners entered the castle – some of whom would not come out alive. Traitors at the gate: Four Romanian men have pleaded guilty to stealing £350 in coins from the moat at Traitors' Gate at the Tower of London . They scooped up £350 of coins thrown in by tourists and attempted to flee with their booty, but their raid was thwarted by a member of the public, who shouted at them and raised the alarm. Tower of London staff and army personnel gave chase and managed to apprehend the looters. The thieves were then arrested at the scene at 7pm on Saturday 31 January by police recruits on their first day on the job and charged with theft. The gang – Ieronim Cancel, 24, Albert Pruteanu, 19, and Tarciziu Cancel and Istoc Ionut, both 22 – have now pleaded guilty to theft at Thames Magistrates’ Court. They were each given a six-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay victim surcharges of £16. Police officers from Tower Hamlets returned to the scene of the crime on Friday to give the stolen money to the Royal British Legion after the thieves were sentenced. Caught: A member of the public raised the alarm, the thieves were caught and the stolen money donated to the Royal British Legion . Millions of tourists every year visit the notorious gate where prisoners such as Anne Boleyn, Sir Thomas More, Catherine Howard and Lady Jane Grey entered the Tower. Many visitors throw loose change into the moat, which can be covered by the Thames at high tide. Yesterday PC Lee Juniper, from Limehouse Police Station, said: ‘It was a privilege to return the donated money to the Royal British Legion. ‘The officers who assisted in the arrest of the four men were new recruits, on their very first day out in Tower Hamlets.’ Britain has seen a huge increase in crime by Romanians in recent years. The Home Office published a detailed breakdown of the nationality of every criminal last year, showing that among the 128,000 Romanians living here, 361 were criminals. Last year the head of Europol warned that travelling gangs of criminals from countries like Romania were using cheap flights and EU freedom of movement rules to launch ‘burglary blitzes’ in Britain and elsewhere. The latest official figures show that just over 95,000 EU nationals were arrested by police in England and Wales in the year to the end of October 2014. More than 30,000 of the arrests were in London. In the past five years 113 Romanian criminal suspects hiding out in Britain have been extradited under the controversial European Arrest Warrant.","Four Romanian men plead guilty to stealing from Traitors' Gate moat .

"Fillip: In a pre-election boost for Chancellor George Osborne, an influential think tank increased its forecast for GDP growth this year to 2.9 per cent . The slump in oil prices is fuelling the fastest growth in the UK economy since before the financial crisis, according to a leading think-tank. In a pre-election boost for Chancellor George Osborne, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research increased its forecast for GDP growth this year to 2.9 per cent – the highest since 2006, when it reached 3 per cent. In November it predicted the economy would grow 2.4 per cent this year, but the think-tank said its ‘significant’ revision is ‘almost entirely due to the sharp fall in oil price’, which has halved in value from $115 a barrel in June to just under $60 now. The benefits are already filtering through to households, with lower petrol prices and energy bills helping to push inflation down to 0.5 per cent. In a speech on Thursday, Bank of England governor Mark Carney is expected to say that Britain faces its first period of deflation – or falling prices – in more than half a century. This will fuel speculation the Bank will leave interest rates on hold at a record low of 0.5 per cent, providing more breathing space for homeowners. Falling prices and rising wages have presented a dilemma for Labour, which has centred its General Election campaign on the ‘cost of living crisis’ in the UK. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls recently dismissed figures that the UK had the fastest growing economy among the G7 nations – the world’s seven leading economies – in 2014, arguing that working people are ‘still not feeling the recovery’. But Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at analysts Capital Economics, said: ‘This is coming at just the right time for Mr Osborne. The falling oil price is providing a considerable boost for households.’ Cut to the cost of living: In a speech on Thursday, Bank of England governor Mark Carney is expected to say that Britain faces its first period of deflation – or falling prices – in more than half a century . In another boost for Mr Osborne, NIESR also predicted unemployment would fall faster than previously expected, dropping from its current rate of 5.9 per cent to 5.2 per cent by the end of the year. This equates to more than 200,000 extra people finding work. But it issued a cautionary note, warning that ‘the weakness of the global economy – and in particular the euro area, by far the UK’s biggest trading partner – remains a hindrance to a significant improvement’. John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce said: ‘I have detected a much higher degree of confidence about the future among businesses.’ Labour's plans to slow the pace of spending cuts will generate more economic growth in the next Parliament, according to the NIESR. The think-tank predicts that plans for higher public borrowing by a Labour or Liberal Democrat government would provide a 1 per cent boost to GDP by the final year of the next Parliament. This compared with a 0.4-0.6 per cent boost by 2019 in plans outlined by Chancellor George Osborne in his Autumn Statement in December. It also believes that unemployment would be reduced faster under Labour’s plans. But NIESR also stressed there would be no longer-term boost to the economy from whittling down the £91billion budget deficit more slowly. It added that less focus on reducing the deficit would also lead to higher interest rates and spending cuts further down the line. The Chancellor wants to balance the country’s books faster than Labour. He has asked forecasting watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility to assume a budget surplus of £23billion in 2019-20. This implies plans to make larger spending cuts than those laid out by the other parties.","Oil almost halved in price from $115 a barrel in June to just under $60 now .

"Sportsmail's Martin Keown reflects on England's 3-1 victory over Scotland at Celtic Park on Tuesday. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain opened the scoring for Roy Hodgson's side before captain Wayne Rooney struck twice in the second half to seal victory over their closest rivals. England celebrated a 3-1 victory over Scotland at Celtic Park in an international friendly on Tuesday . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain came in well off the touchline for his goal but his all-round game was not good enough. He didn’t work hard enough off the ball and England cannot afford to carry anyone defensively. When Scotland had the ball, Oxlade-Chamberlain too often went into rest mode and Andrew Robertson stole a march on him too many times down the flank. He is always a threat going forward but he needs to get into a defensive position much quicker and learn to cut out the ball down the line. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored the opening goal as he glanced home Jack Wilshere's cross . Wilshere was often caught out of position defensively at Celtic Park . He was guilty of not doing that for Arsenal against Swansea recently too and that left Calum Chambers far too exposed at right back. Oxlade-Chamberlain took his goal very well but there are still areas of his game that need improving. England need to get Jack Wilshere on the ball more. He’s our playmaker and is supremely talented and England weren’t looking for him enough against Scotland. When they did finally get him on the ball, we saw with the goal just what he is capable of. But Wilshere is partly to blame too. He was sometimes standing in positions where he couldn’t receive the ball that easily from his team-mates. He needs to work harder to find the space so the rest of the team can get him on the ball in dangerous positions. Wilshere produced a superb assist for England's opening goal and was a creative threat . The attitude of England’s players impressed me. They did not seem to have an eye on protecting themselves ahead of the return of the Premier League, they were fully committed. Danny Welbeck put in plenty of tasty challenges and Wayne Rooney and Luke Shaw in particular looked well up for the game. This fixture might be a friendly by name but it clearly mattered more than that to Roy Hodgson’s men. It was good to see them showing some strong fighting spirit.

"Video of the moment a Japanese surfer was killed by shark on a beach near Ballina was streamed across the world. Tadashi Nakahara, 41, has been named as the victim of the tragic shark attack at popular surfing spot Shelly Beach on New South Wales' north coast on Monday. It has now emerged footage of the incident, which happened just before 8am local time, was captured by Coastalwatch's surf cam, which can be viewed worldwide. This means anyone watching the live stream could have witnessed the attack, but the video is now no longer available on the website. Scroll down for video . 41-year-old Japanese national Tadashi Nakahara (pictured left) died after being attacked by a shark in Ballina . It has now emerged footage of the incident, which happened just before 8am local time, was captured by Coastalwatch's surf cam . In a statement on its website, Coastalwatch confirmed its network had recorded the tragedy as it unfolded. 'Surf Lifesaving NSW... used the surf cam to assist with the rescue and safety operations immediately after the incident,' the statement said. 'Surf Lifesaving NSW have supplied NSW Police with video to help with their investigation. 'Coastalwatch and CoastalCOMS - who license the cameras and footage - will not be releasing any footage as is company policy around fatalities.' The surfboard technician, was reportedly sitting on his board just 10 metres from shore near four other surfers  when the shark - believed to be a four-metre great white - attacked. Authorities resumed their search for the shark using helicopters, rescue boats and jet skis on Tuesday as beaches between South Ballina and Lennox Head remain closed and lifeguards are patrolling to ensure swimmers stay out of the water. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia just after the incident happened, a worker from the Australian Hotel in Ballina said the man worked at Websters Surfboards on the outskirts of the city and was an avid surfer. The victim lost both his legs and the other surfers brought him to shore where they tried to tend to his injuries and administered CPR, but he lost too much blood and was pronounced dead at the scene. Ballina Mayor David Wright said a shark expert from the Department of Primary Industries was heading to Ballina to investigate. The surfers who were with Mr Nakahara described the shark as being three to four metres long, Cr Wright told ABC Radio. 'It came up behind and took his board and his legs and that's a horrible thing to happen,' he said. Cr Wright said the water was warm and a lot of fish were feeding close to the surface which can attract sharks. 'The fish are travelling through and the predators ... come in and try and get it - there were lots of dolphins there yesterday going through, seven or eight, attacking the fish too,' he said. Cr Wright believes the chances of finding the shark were quite remote. Mr Nakahara was from Japan but had been living in the area for a number of years. He has been formally identified and police are working with the Japanese consulate to inform his family of his death. Local residents lay flowers at the beach where the Japanese surfer was killed by a shark. Authorities closed the beach, near Ballina in northern NSW . Authorities are searching for the shark - believed to be a four-metre great white - using helicopters, rescue boats and jet skis . On Monday, Detective Inspector Cameron Lindsay said a witness had been filming the beach at the time but said the footage appeared to have been taken after the attack. 'At this stage we don’t believe we have video of the actual attack,' Det Insp Lindsay said. 'What it appears to capture is a large amount of blood in the water.' Friends of the man told local cafe owner, Karen, the shark came out from nowhere. 'It just came up between a bunch of surfers,' she told AAP on Monday. 'They weren't even that far out. 'He lost both his legs.' The victim's friends were shaken up and looked 'white as a ghost' as they carried their mate's board away from the beach, the local said. Authorities kept swimmers and surfers out of the water after today's fatal attack by a shark, which severed both of the man's legs . On the day of the incident, Cr Wright said authorities believed it could be the same shark that attacked a surfer at nearby Seven Mile Beach on Sunday. 'Now the sharks had two bites, if it's the same one, we certainly have to keep our eyes on it,' he said. Cr Wright said surf life saving helicopters, jet skis and boats were now searching for the great white. 'It's a pretty big shark so it's most likely gone,' he said. Paramedics at Shelly Beach attempted to revive the man following the attack just before 10am on Monday but he was pronounced dead at the scene . Three other surfers pulled the victim out of the water following the attack just before 10am on Monday and said the shark was about four metres long, the Ballina Shire Advocate reported. 'The people who pulled him out weren't all that old so we're trying to get some counselling for them,' Cr Wright said. NSW Life Saving Manager Andy Kent said lifeguards had been stationed at all beaches in the Ballina Shire to keep the public informed and out of the water. 'This is obviously a very serious incident and we would ask that the public follow the directions of emergency service workers and lifeguards by remaining clear of the water,' Mr Kent said. 'Our thoughts go out to the man's family and friends, who are dealing with this tragedy.' The man's death brings the number of shark attacks to six in the past year and four in the past five months in Australia. There have been 174 fatal shark attacks in the past 100 years and 809 attacks reported. The beach will stay closed until authorities decide it is safe for swimmers to return to the water . Father-of-one Jabez Reitman suffered back lacerations and received stitches at Gold Coast University Hospital . This comes a day after a surfer was injured in a shark attack at nearby Seven Mile Beach when he mistook the creature for a dolphin. Father-of-one Jabez Reitman, 35, suffered back lacerations and was rushed to Gold Coast University Hospital from Seven Mile Beach in Broken Head, south of Byron Bay on New South Wales' north coast. Mr Reitman claims the shark was two to three metres long. The Byron Bay man says he panicked when he realised he was hurt as he had been completely unaware a shark was nearby, according to Seven News. 'I just freaked out you know, I thought it was a dolphin at first, until it (his back) started stinging,' he told Seven. 'I didn't realise that there are some pretty bad lacerations.' The keen swimmer says he is not deterred by the suspected shark attack and is keenly awaiting his return to the water. The Byron Bay man says he panicked when he realised he was hurt as he had been completely unaware a shark was nearby. At first, he mistook the creature for a dolphin .

The bureau monitored travel plans of writers and even reviewed copies of works such as Ms Hansberry's A Raisin In The Sun and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man before they had been released. Lorraine Hansberry, the author of A Raisin in the Sun, had her work read by the FBI before it was published . FBI agents were known to have investigated poet Langston Hughes and writer James Baldwin. But files on a broader range of prominent black authors, 51 of them, were found by William Maxwell, a professor of English and African-American studies at Washington University in St Louis. The academic was researching playwright Claude McKay and found out that the Jamaican-born writer had an FBI file that stretched to 193 pages, according to the Guardian. Ms Hansberry's file was more than 1,000 pages and Mr Baldwin's more than 1,800. Prof Maxwell's investigation found nearly 14,000 pages from files devoted to black writers, many of whom the government was going to imprison if there was a national emergency, including Mr Hughes and Gwendolyn Bennett. Langston Hughes (right), was on a list of people to be imprisoned during a national emergency. Ralph Ellison (left) originally had a line about the FBI in Invisible Man before it was taken out in the final version . Literary figures that went abroad such as Mr McKay were put on 'stop notice' lists and were supposed to be given 'appropriate attention' if they returned to the US. The average length of files with page numbers, some of which monitored writers for more than 40 years, was 300 pages. Other prominent black writers monitored include WEB Du Bois, Alice Childress and the Black Arts Repertory Theater. The attention to African-American literature during the mid-20th century paralleled a deep hatred of the civil rights movement and Dr Martin Luther King Jr by Mr J Edgar Hoover and the FBI. Prof Maxwell's book FB Eyes, which takes its name from a Richard Wright poem about being under surveillance, opens with a letter thought to be from the FBI that allegedly tried to convince Dr King to commit suicide before accepting his Nobel Prize. University of Washington St Louis professor William Maxwell was researching Claude McKay (right) when he began his book on FBI surveillance of black writers . The book then chronicles how law enforcement  interacted with black writers from 1919, the beginning of the Harlem Renaissance, all the way to Mr Hoover's death in 1972. Officials became particularly interested in exploring black writers' ties to socialism and communism during the McCarthy Red Scare era. 'I knew Hoover was especially impressed and worried by the busy crossroads of black protest, leftwing politics, and literary potential. But I was surprised to learn that the FBI had read, monitored, and ""filed"" nearly half of the nationally prominent African American authors,' Prof Maxwell said. Black writers during the time were also aware that their works were being read by government ghostreaders. The knowledge worked its way into poems like Richard Wright's FB Eyes, though may have toned down other writers. James Baldwin, who was linked to the civil rights movement but lived many years abroad, had a 16-year 1,800-page file at the FBI . FBI files for Mr Baldwin detail his movements around Europe, with some parts redacted by the government . The original manuscript of Invisible Man shows that Mr Ellison included a line about working under 'a master FBI man' that was later taken out. 'The suspicion that government spy-critics tracked their every word inspired rewarding stylistic experiments as well as disabling self-censorship,' according to Princeton University Press. While Prof Maxwell said that the FBI was 'among the most dedicated foes of the diverse African American literary intellectuals' he also added that the idea that black culture was central to black politics was also part of many of the authors' work. Prof Maxwell said that some of the ghostreaders began liking the aesthetic beauty of the black authors' works.","FBI was going to imprison some writers if there was a national emergency .

"One might think it's run-of-the-mill to find Australia’s super cute mascots cuddling each other, but experts say snuggling koalas are no ordinary sight. Heart-warming images have surfaced of two-year-old koala Max embracing his new treemate Tucker, 18 month old, in the same tree fork. Taronga Zoo koala keeper Laura Jones told Daily Mail Australia it was one of the most surprising scenes she had seen in five years on the job. Scroll down for video . Two-year-old koala Max (right) cuddles sup to his new treemate Tucker (left), 18 month old, in the same tree fork . Taronga Zoo koala keeper Laura Jones told Daily Mail Australia it was one of the most surprising scenes she had seen in five years on the job . ‘We brought Max in for the breeding program. The first 36 hours with Tucker were a bit of a rough start, since Max was determined to prove himself as the boss,’ she said. Two-year-old Max was only recently introduced to the closure, which is usually an aggressive period. ‘There was a bit of bellowing and tussling for dominance. But it was smooth sailing from then on.’ Within 10 days, when the images were taken, Max and Tucker were getting along like a house on fire. ‘It means they have accepted their hierarchy. They feel comfortable in one another's confines,’ Jones said. Max (pictured) had an initially hostile period when he moved into the enclosure with Tucker, but they were pictured sleeping together just ten days later . Jones said koalas are not as cuddly as people think, and they will generally only get close for safety in the wild . ‘It was terrific to find them so intimate. There is no way you would find this with fully grown adults. We rarely have males living together at all, so we're all very surprised.' Jones said that housing the koala’s together means they can divide the time spent resting and being active for ‘koala encounters’ with members of the public. ‘Max is capable of impregnating the females, so we needed to house him with another boy,’ Jones added. (left to right) Female koalas Milli and Sydney cuddle up to a 12-month-old Tucker in a rare embrace . Jones said koalas are not as cuddly as people think, and they will generally only get close for safety in the wild. ‘The only other time I have found them so intimate was last year, when Tucker snuggled up to Sydney and Milli, two of our female koalas.’ Jones said it is currently koala mating season, meaning those driving around high density areas should watch out for koalas on the roads and be wary of bellowing, their mating call.","Two-year-old koala Max recently moved into the Taronga Zoo enclosure .

"Stongehenge has stood frozen in time for thousands of years, but this replica was never going to survive to welcome the summer solstice. Using chainsaws and ice cutters, five friends created their very own freezing homage to the ancient structure on a frosted Wisconsin lake. Each of the gigantic ice pillars used to make the frozen circle weighed a back-breaking 300 pounds. The blocks placed on top of the model of the neolithic monument weighed a further 200 pounds. Scroll down for video . Frozen in time: Five friends created this homage to Stonehenge using huge blocks of ice cut from Rock Lake, Wisconsin . This was the second time Drew McHenry, Kevin Lehner, Quinn Williams, Alec Seamars and Patrick Shields had attempted to recreate Stonehenge. Last year they had to abandoned their Icehenge plans due to persistent below zero temperatures and the thickness of Rock Lake. The team took two weeks to create the giant frozen structure using chainsaws and ice cutters . Male bonding: This is the second time that the friends have tried to create a replica of Stonehenge . This year the huge structure took shape in just two weeks after the group were blessed with perfect weather conditions. The reproduction of the monument  was enjoyed by hundreds of people before it had to be taken down due to safety concerns as the ice began to melt. 'It is a great example of how a small group of folks can collaborate to make something magic,' said Mr Lehner. The group first started experimenting with ice cutting four years ago. No-one is sure why the original Stonehenge, which can be found in Wiltshire, UK, was built or how. Over the years people have suggested that it was a temple, parliament and a graveyard.

"A series of crashes on an icy interstate toll road involving 40 vehicles that left one person dead and several others injured are under investigation, New Jersey State Police said Tuesday. The accidents began on the New Jersey Turnpike just before 9:15 p.m. Monday during a mix of rain and snow flurries and below-freezing temperatures in Cranbury, a township about 40 miles southwest of New York City. Two tractor-trailers obstructed the road when they lost control in the truck lanes as they attempted to avoid earlier crashes, triggering a chain-reaction crash involving 13 vehicles in which Daryl Williams, 52, of Bordentown, New Jersey, became trapped in his car and died, state police said.

"A dog whose only puppy disappeared now walks the streets of a Chinese city carrying a board appealing for help to find her 'darling' puppy. Aidi's owner, Yang Fan, said her puppy went missing while he was walking the two dogs in Jilin in north-eastern China's Jilin province. The sign reads: 'I will pay the one who helps me find my darling dog.' Aidi stands with a sign reading 'I will pay for the one who helps me find my darling dog' Mr Yang, 65, was given Aidi by his son after he moved away for work four years ago, leaving him to live alone. Mr Yang's wife had died just over a year before, and his son worried his father would be lonely. He said: 'I was not so bothered at the start about having a dog but must admit we are now very close, she has become one of my family and is a great companion.' Aidi had two puppies, but only one survived. The missing puppy, said to have been in good health when it disappeared, is now two-and-a-half-months old. Mr Yang said: 'I was taking both mother and puppy for a walk, and the young dog was very excitable but always kept close to its mother. But then suddenly we both noticed it was gone, and although we looked everywhere we could no longer find the puppy.' Mr Yang said Aidi has always been 'very intelligent and she realised quickly what the sign was for' Mr Yang said Aidi never gave up wanting to look for her offspring. 'Aidi was really upset and the next day when she continued to want to go out searching for the puppy, I decided to make her a sign to carry. 'She has always been very intelligent and she realised quickly what the sign was for, and we have had lots of people reporting sightings but so far none of them have worked out. But we are getting new leads every day, and I hope we might still be able to find her puppy.' Mr Yang added: 'It's been like losing a member of the family, I hope somebody will be able to help.' .","Yang Fan, 65, was given Aidi by his son to stop him feeling lonely .

"A search is underway for an 18-year-old who was swept off rocks by a massive wave and into the ocean at Laguna Beach, California. Anthony Parnell, from Las Vegas, Nevada, was on the rocks with his girlfriend and two friends just south of Thousand Steps Beach on Sunday when he was hit by high surf and washed away. His devastated father, who rushed to California with his wife and other children when they learned the boy was missing, said he couldn't believe his son had been so close to the water. 'That boy was scared of the ocean,' Foster Parnell told the OC Register. Scroll down for video . Fears: Anthony Parnell, pictured left and right with his girlfriend, was standing on rocks in Laguna Beach, California on Sunday afternoon when he was swept into the ocean by a massive wave . Scene: Searchers gather on the rocks close to where Parnell was last seen before the wave took over . 'For him to be on those rocks? He swam, but wasn't a strong swimmer... He screamed underwater on a dive trip when he saw a fish.' The group of friends had been exploring the rocks when the large wave hit them on Sunday afternoon - and when it washed away, they realized Parnell was gone. Orange County lifeguards and the U.S. Coast Guard launched a massive search on foot and from the air, but as of Tuesday, the boy had still not been found. Jason Young, chief of Orange County Lifeguards, suggested that Parnell was swept into a crevasse and could be trapped in the maze of rocks beneath the surface. He said his team were looking into the rocks and using tools to see if his body was down there. Searchers told the family on Sunday that their job had changed from a rescue mission to a recovery mission - but the Parnells said they were not leaving the area until the teen's body was found. 'I just wish we could find him,' Mr Parnell told NBC. 'It's killing my wife, we just want to bring him back to Vegas... so we can have some closure. That's the bottom line. It will be hard to leave here without him.' Shock: His father, Foster Parnell, said they did not want to return home to Nevada without the boy's body . Hunt: Rescuers searched on foot and from the air - but said the effort is now a recovery mission . Concerns: A relative comforts Parnell's girlfriend as they wait for news on the beach .

"Almost a century on, footage has surfaced of a freak boating disaster that killed 844 people traveling to a company picnic  in Chicago. On the morning of July 24, 1915 the SS Eastland capsized while it was still docked in around 20ft of water. Many of the victims were children and teenagers, who drowned while wearing their Sunday best. Two newly-discovered grainy black and white clips of the incident show workers trying to right the luxury vessel, with survivors huddled together shivering in blankets. Caught on camera: Almost a century on, footage has surfaced of a boating disaster that killed 844 people en route to a company picnic in Chicago . All hands on deck: On July 24, 1915 the SS Eastland capsized while it was still docked in an estimated 20 feet of water. Many of the victims were children and teenagers, who were dressed in their Sunday best . There were a total of 2,500 passengers on board that fateful day. Western Electric had chartered the Eastland and other ships to take employees from its Hawthorne factory in Cicero, Illinois, to a summer party in Michigan City, Indiana. At the time the company had around 10,000 staff. The Eastland - which launched in 1903 - had a reputation for being unstable  and its licensed capacity had been reduced several times in a bid to balance it out. Many blamed its eventual sinking on a case of overcrowding. After being salvaged, the shipwrecked Eastland was sold to the U.S. Navy. It was renovated and renamed the USS Wilmette as a designated gunboat. She was primarily used for training purposes on the Great Lakes and scrapped after World War II . Jeff Nichols, a doctoral student at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told CBS News that he found the videos of the Eastland while he was looking through seemingly unrelated material on World War I. He was using the website http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en, which gathers digitized memorabilia and personal stories from individuals. The Eastland Disaster Historical Society says the film Nichols discovered on Europeana humanizes the tragedy in a new way. Watery grave: Two newly-discovered grainy black and white clips of the incident shows workers trying to right the vessel, while survivors stand shivering in blankets. Boasting tragedy: There were a total of 2,500 passengers on board that fateful day . Ted Wachholz, the organisation's executive director said: 'The film footage . . . is the single most important discovery from research over the past 100 years for those who are interested in the history of the Eastland Disaster. 'Over the past 16 years, EDHS has pursued numerous leads, driven hundreds of miles, sent emails, and made phone calls all while responding to reports of possible film footage of the Eastland Disaster. 'All of these previous leads have ended without any results. Late Friday, however, Mr. Nichols was gracious enough to share his discovery on our Facebook page. 'All of us at EDHS and many more who follow us have gotten chills upon viewing this incredible footage, and we know that thousands more will experience the same.' Caroline Homolka, 17, was among the victims of the Eastland sinking. She and her brother Joe both worked for Western Electric and were getting ready to attend the picnic and decided to go separately with their own friends.

New pastures: After being salvaged, the boat was sold to the U.S. Navy . Victims: Agnes Latowski  was an employee of the Western Electric company and was aboard the Eastland along with her older brother Walter and older sister Nellie who both perished . Joe was rescued but Caroline was killed. Her sister Blanche recalled the heartbreaking chain of events: 'I'll never forget that evening. Joe was home by then exhausted as were poor Mother and Daddy. 'We kids couldn't imagine such a tragedy. I even remember there was a shortage of coffins and so when my dear sister Carrie was brought home, they had placed her on a sort of wicker sofa. She lay there as beautiful as ever. 'Oh poor Carrie, we were told that she must have fallen when the boat tipped over because she had a dark bruise, and that it killed her instantly . 'There she lay, and she had a death pall over her face. It was brought home to rest every time we sat at the table and there was one missing, at every meal, one missing.'

"An adulterer who has had over 100 affairs with married men has claimed she has never wrecked a marriage. Karen Marley, a 48-year-old divorcee from Richmond, N.Yorks, has been finding men on extra-marital dating sites since 2006. In an interview on This Morning today, the antiques dealer also stated that when she finally decides to settle down in a monogamous relationship, her man won't cheat because, 'I'd probably be able to keep him happy.' Scroll down for video . Karen Marley, a 48-year-old divorcee, appeared on ITV's This Morning today and claimed that despite her 100 extra-marital relationships, she had never wrecked a marriage . Appearing on the ITV show alongside hosts Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley, and agony aunt Denise Robertson, the antiques dealer said. 'Never in all of the years doing this have I wrecked a marriage. 'I am absolutely sure I’ve never personally split up a marriage.' She continued: 'I would never be like the woman in Fatal Attraction and make anyone leave his wife. 'There are so many men looking for an affair because it suits them. If he chooses to leave that is his choice. 'If anyone has ever suggested it, they’ve been dropped straight away.' Talking of her first foray into the world of secret extra-marital trysts, she said: 'When I first signed up to dating sites, I soon figured most of the men were married. 'They weren’t available after five o'clock and couldn't see me during weekends. 'They were keen during working hours and would occasionally slip away whilst washing the car on a Sunday - but it was fairly obvious. 'Then I would get these very random text messages at times that you knew the wife wasn't around.' That's when Ms Marley decided to sign up to an extra-marital dating site, something recent statistics show over a million fellow Brits have done. She said: 'It was nice to know where the boundaries were.' She continued: 'I’m single and I love being single. I love my single life - I get to see my friends – and [when I joined the site] I didn’t particularly want a relationship with someone who would monopolise my time.' So she opted instead for married men, who would 'pop up every fortnight' to see her before going back to their wives and family. 48-year-old divorcee Karen (second from right) shocked hosts Philip Schofield (left) and Christine Bleakley (second left) and agony aunt Denise Robertson (far right) by saying  her own man would never cheat on her . Karen also attempted to justify her behaviour by claiming that not all of her relationships with married men were sexual. She said: 'They're not all sexual. With a lot of guys it's just friendships. 'Most guys have no one to talk to – they don’t talk to friends about emotional problems.' Since 2006, Ms Marley has dated over 100 married men and had 'fully blown affairs' with 20 of them. Although she claims not to have broken up any marriages, Karen admits that some of the affairs have left her feeling guilty. She said: 'There is some sense of guilt because women should know. I feel incredibly sorry for the wives who genuinely don’t know. 'But I also think that if a guy is on a site looking for an affair the they are already on that road. 'If they are prepared to go looking for someone to have an affair with, they'll have an affair.' Talking of her first foray into the world of secret extra-marital trysts, Karen said: 'When I first signed up to dating sites I soon figured most of the men were married' Karen has been dating married men for so long now that she has a set of guidelines that she initiates for every new relationship so the man's wife doesn't find out. She revealed: 'We sort out guidelines and rules beforehand - I don’t date anywhere near home as I don’t want to bump into someone with their wife in the supermarket. 'I date far from home so I don’t have to be twitchy.' But despite her willingness to get into a relationship with a married man, Karen revealed that she would drop a boyfriend in an instant if she found out they were cheating on her. She said: 'The second I knew about it he'd be gone. I would not tolerate an affair. 'I would not settle down with any man I've dated. If they're going to cheat once, they'll cheat twice.' But she also expressed doubt any man of hers would cheat, saying: 'I'd probably be able to keep him happy.'","Divorcee Karen Marley, 48, finds men on extra-marital dating sites .

"Speculation was rife last week when an Apple-owned car was spotted driving around California fitted with Street View-style cameras. At the time, rumours suggested the firm was working on its own version of Google's popular mapping site but there could be another explanation. A source claiming to be an Apple employee has hinted that the giant is developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.' Scroll down for video . A unnamed Apple employee has hinted that the tech giant is developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.' The email was sent to Business Insider. It followed sightings of an Apple-owned car fitted with cameras (pictured) in California . The email from the unnamed employee was sent to Business Insider. It described 'vehicle development' at the company but didn't reveal further information. In particular, Apple may be working on an electric car to rival Tesla's range or a self-driving car that would ultimately also rival Google's autonomous project. The cameras on the mysterious van could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop self-driving software, for example. Claims that Apple is building a car may seem like a leap, but it isn't the first time such projects have been discussed by the Californian firm. In an interview last year, Apple board member Mickey Drexler said that before his death in 2011 Steve Jobs had considered building a car. He told Paul Goldberger: 'Steve Jobs was gonna design an iCar. I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.' This may seem like a leap for Apple to take, but it isn't the first time such projects have been discussed by the Californian firm. In an interview last year, Apple board member Mickey Drexler said that before his death in 2011 Steve Jobs had considered building a car. He told Paul Goldberger: 'Steve Jobs was gonna design an iCar. I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.' Alternatively, the Apple employee's email could be referring to an advanced iPhone in-car control system that would rival Tesla's software. The Dodge van with the equipment on the top was spotted by the blog Claycord in San Francisco. The blog owners apparently asked the driver what he was doing, but he refused to give an answer. But a video from last year shows a similar car, which later transpired to be an unmarked self-driving Dodge caravan. In particular, Apple may be working on an electric car to rival Tesla's range (the Tesla P85D is pictured) or the email could be referring to an advanced iPhone in-car control system that would rival Tesla's software . Alternatively, the vehicle spotted in California could be a self-driving car. The cameras on the mysterious van could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop autonomous software, for example. If Apple was developing such systems, they would would rival Google's self-driving cars (pictured) According to 9to5mac, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) confirmed the vehicle was leased to Apple. The head of self-driving cars for Google expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years. Chris Urmson said the cars would still be test vehicles, and Google would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians. But Mr Urmson wouldn't give a date for putting driverless cars on roads en masse, saying that the system has to be safe enough to work properly. He told reporters last month at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit that he wants to reach the point where his test team no longer has to pilot the cars. With 12 cameras on top of the car, some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like Google's Street View. 'Too many cameras,' said technology analyst Rob Enderle. 'It has cameras that are angled down at all four corners of the vehicle.' This would further lend itself to the self-driving car theory. 'Unfortunately for that theory, only six companies have been issued the permits necessary to test such vehicles, and Apple isn't one of them,' said 9to5mac. 'This brings us back to a much more likely conclusion: Apple is preparing to take on Google's Street View with a similar offering in its own Maps software.' They said it might feature as part of the iOS 9 upgrade due later this year, although it would likely begin only with select cities such as New York and San Francisco. This would plug a noticeable hole in Apple Maps, which has been missing Street View-style images ever since Apple made it the default maps app for iPhones. When contacted by MailOnline, Apple declined to comment on the car in question or what its purpose was.

"A church has banned a yoga class from using its hall because of its links with 'alternative spiritualities'. Instructor Naomi Hayama has been told by church leaders at St Michael and All Angels in Bristol that she will have to find another venue – even though she has used the hall for nine years. In a letter, the parochial church council told her that yoga's roots 'lie in thinking that is not compatible with the Christian faith'. Not welcome any more... Yoga instructor Naomi Hayama has been told by chiefs at St Michael and All Angels in Bristol that she will have to find another venue – even though she has used their hall for nine years . Her students have been left angry at the decision, telling the church the twice-weekly evening classes at St Michael's Hall have no religious content whatsoever. Ms Hayama, said the decision was made despite church leaders never observing one of her sessions. In a letter to her, the Parish of Bishopston and St Andrews' Parochial Church Council said yoga fell foul of a new ban on groups linked to 'alternative spiritualities'. 'We are aware that yoga can be practised as either an exercise class or as a spiritual discipline and anywhere in between, however we understand that its roots lie in thinking that it is not compatible with the Christian faith and the Christian faith has not appropriated yoga,' the letter stated. 'The parish church council recently passed a resolution stating that we would no longer take either new or continuing bookings for groups practising ""alternative spiritualities"".' Ms Hayama, 39, from Horfield, has until the end of the month to find alternative premises and avoid letting down her 30 students. Angry: Ms Hayama, said the decision was made despite church leaders never observing one of her sessions . In a statement, the Church said yoga was a 'spiritual activity whose roots are not Christ-centred'. 'All of our buildings are open to and used by a wide range of groups from the local community,' the Church said. 'The primary purpose of these buildings is the worship of God as revealed in the person of Jesus Christ. 'Yoga means the union of ""mind, body and spirit"". By definition, therefore, Yoga is a spiritual activity whose roots are not Christ centred. 'We are confident we have acted legally and have waived the last nine months of Naomi's fees, amounting to nearly £1,000. 'We are surprised at the actions currently being taken. Whilst we understand that Naomi would not agree with our decision, in December 2014 she informed us that we had reached an agreeable compromise with regard to her notice period.' A spokeswoman for the Diocese of Bristol said: 'Decisions on who can lease church buildings lie entirely within the remit of the relevant parochial church council (PCC) in each case. 'The Diocese of Bristol therefore supports the PCC of Bishopston and St Andrews in exercising its responsibility in deciding to cease bookings for a yoga class in St Michael's Church.'","Naomi Hayama told her yoga class is banned as it's not 'Christ-centred'

"A U.S. Marine who is accused of faking his own kidnapping after vanished from his post in Iraq more than a decade ago is set to finally stand trial - 10 years after he disappeared for the second time. Corporal Wassef Hassoun has opted to be tried by a judge rather than a jury as he faces charges of desertion, larceny and destruction of property in a military court. The trial is expected to hear opening statements today, with the prosecution alleging Hassoun fled his post in 2004 because he was unhappy with his deployment and the treatment of Iraqis by American troops. Accused: Corporal Wassef Hassoun, pictured yesterday, is accused of fleeing his post in Iraq in 2004 - but he says he was kidnapped . The defense claim Hassoun did not flee, but was kidnapped and later became tangled up in Lebanese courts. However, the 35-year-old has conceded his second disappearance - after he was ordered to stand trial the first time, in 2005 - began with an unauthorized absence, entering a guilty plea to a lesser offence. Hassoun first disappeared from a base in Fallujah, Iraq, in June 2004. Days later, he appeared blindfolded and with a sword poised above his head in an image - purportedly taken by insurgents. An extremist group claimed to be holding him captive. Not long after, Hassoun turned up unharmed at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, saying he'd been kidnapped. But officials were suspicious, and he was brought back to Camp Lejeune in 2004 while the military considered charging him. Speaking in 2004, Hassoun said: 'I did not desert my post. I was captured and held against my will by anti-coalition forces for 19 days. This was a very difficult and challenging time for me.' A five month investigation concluded with Hassoun being charged for desertion and theft of military property, including a military-issued M9 pistol he carried with him. It was then decided to allow Hassoun  to visit family in Utah - at which point, he disappeared for a second time. In early 2005, and with a military court hearing looming, he traveled to Lebanon. He had not yet been formally charged. But once he was in the country, he was arrested by the Lebanese authorities after Interpol issued a bulletin. The defense says court proceedings in Lebanon lasted until 2013, and Hassoun turned himself in after the government there lifted travel restrictions. Prosecutors, on the other hand, say his whereabouts was unknown for years. Hassoun appeared in a video, purporting to be from his kidnappers, above, after his disappearance - but he reappeared shortly afterwards, handing himself in unharmed to the U.S. Embassy in Beirut . Hassoun, left, being escorted to the courtroom on Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, N.C., then disappeared once more - this time to Lebanon in early 2005 . Hassoun eventually surrendered to NCIS investigators in Bahrain in the middle of last year, reportedly telling them that he feared for his life in Lebanon. Back in the U.S., he could face as much as 27 years behind bars. In 2005, Hassoun faced a dishonorable discharge, in addition to five to 10 years incarceration. His brother has previously argued Hassoun chose to flee to his homeland of Lebanon because of pressure from the initial allegations, as well as a purported anti-Muslim bias in the military. 'Instead of them giving him medals and making him feel good about his service and what he was doing for his country, they gave him an Article 32,' Hassoun's brother said of the military court proceedings that his brother was to have faced in January 2005. The Marine Corps denied any anti-Muslim sentiment in their handling of Hassoun. The Marine returned to the U.S. last year, handing himself into NCIS investigators in Bharain - saying he was in fear of his life in Lebanon . On Monday, judge Marine Major Nicholas Martz denied a defence motion to prevent prosecutors from calling an Iraqi who is now living in the United States. Defence attorney Haytham Faraj argued the witness interacted with his client long before the disappearance and those conversations weren't relevant. But prosecutor Captain Chris Nassar said Hassoun made incriminating comments to the witness, including that he didn't want to die in Iraq and wanted to leave the Marines. The judge also denied a prosecution motion seeking to bar the defence from referring in opening statements to the video that purportedly shows Hassoun being held by insurgents, nor mention Lebanese government documents related to court proceedings against Hassoun in that country. The judge allowed the evidence to be mentioned in opening statements, but warned that the defence must later show the trustworthiness of those documents.

"President Barack Obama is slapping back at a former longtime top adviser who writes in a new book that he lied for years about his position on gay marriage so he could get elected president in 2008. David Axelrod 'is mixing up my personal feelings with my position on the issue,' the president said Tuesday, in a startling admission that his public stance on the divisive social issue wasn't always in sync with what he actually believed. 'I always felt that same-sex couples should be able to enjoy the same rights, legally, as anybody else,' Obama told Buzzfeed, and so it was frustrating to me not to, I think, be able to square that with what were a whole bunch of religious sensitivities out there.' Documents reveal wild swings in the Chicago politician's stated positions as his career developed in the 1990s and beyond. But on Tuesday the president claimed his true feelings never wavered. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . HE LIED: Obama misled the public about his views on gay marriage in order to get to the White House, according to his longtime close adviser David Axelrod (center, pictured in the Oval Office in 2010) By the year 2000, as an Illinois state senator, Obama already been through a flip-flop on same-sex marriage, one that wouldn't come full circle for more than another decade . The president responded to a questionnaire in 1996 from the Chicago-based Outlines newspaper, as he was making his first run for the state Senate in Illinois, saying that he strongly believed in legalizing same-sex unions. 'I favor legalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages,' Obama wrote then. Two years later, as his political future began to take shape, he told the same newspaper that he was 'undecided.' Obama said Tuesday that 'the old questionnaire, you know, is an example of struggling with what was a real issue at the time, which is how do you make sure that people’s rights are enjoyed and these religious sensitivities were taken into account?' 'You know, these are the kinds of things you learn as you ... move forward in public life: that sometimes you can’t split the difference. That sometimes you just have to be very clear that this is what’s right.' It took the president more than a decade to take that advice. By 2008, under the glare of a presidential campaign and the weight of history, his public rhetoric swung to a position that America's Bible belt could embrace – support for only a traditional definition of marriage. But as president in 2010 he returned publicly to his original position 14 years after he first articulated it. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday about the timeline that brought Obama to his eventual public awakening on the issue, which came after a series of court rulings made it less politically risky to support gay marriage rights. Axelrod writes in 'Believer: My Forty Years in Politics' that he told the future president in 2008 that he should hide the ball and deceive the American public for political purposes. 'Opposition to gay marriage was particularly strong in the black church,' the former Obama insider writes, 'and as he ran for higher office, he grudgingly accepted the counsel of more pragmatic folks like me, and modified his position to support civil unions rather than marriage, which he would term a ""sacred union"".' In 1996 when Barack Obama ran for statewide office in Illinois for the first time, he told a Chicago newspaper called Outlines that 'I favor legalizing same-sex marriages' By 1998 Obama's transformation into a more cautious – and electable – politician had begun; he told the same paper that he was 'undecided' about marriage rights for gays and lesbians . That duplicity reached its apex during a 2008 appearance at Pastor Rick Warren's Saddleback Church, a wellspring of American evangelical Christian thought. 'I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman,' he said then. 'Now, for me as a Christian – for me – for me as a Christian, it is also a sacred union. God's in the mix.' And just two days before he would be elected president, he told an interview on MTV that 'I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.' Six months into his first term as president, Obama would ask Congress to repeal the Defense Of Marriage Act, an anti-gay-unions law. THe following year he told a group of liberal bloggers that he was having a change of heart. 'Attitudes evolve, including mine,' Obama said then. On Tuesday he repositioned his personal slipstream of policy shifts as a much narrower matter of semantics driven by hurt feelings. 'Where my evolution took place,' Obama said in his Buzzfeed interview, 'was not in my attitude toward same-sex couples. It was in understanding the pain and the sense of stigma that was being placed on same-sex couples who are friends of mine, where they’d say, ""You know what, if you’re not calling it marriage, it doesn’t feel like the same thing. Even if you gave me the same rights, the fact that I’m being treated differently or the love that we feel is somehow segmented off, that hurts"".' 'It was because of those conversations that I ended up shifting positions,' he explained – 'that civil unions, in fact, were not sufficient rather than marriage.' 'But I think the notion that somehow I was always in favor of marriage per se isn’t quite accurate.' If he was having a change of heart, Axelrod writes, it was in the process of returning to his true feelings. 'If Obama's views were ""evolving"" publicly, they were fully evolved behind closed doors,' he relates in his book. 'The president was champing at the bit to announce his support for the right of gay and lesbian couples to wed – and having watched him struggle with this issue for years, I was ready, too.' HIDE THE BALL: Two days before his first presidential election, he told an MTV audience that 'I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.' Time magazine got the first sneak peek at the section of the book, released Tuesday, that deals with Obama's on-again, off-again relationship with the gay marriage issue. Axelrod's recollections pair a picture of Obama as a tortured soul, unable to square his self-image as a tgruth teller with the reality of his political lie. 'Having prided himself on forthrightness, though, Obama never felt comfortable with his compromise and, no doubt, compromised position,' he writes. 'He routinely stumbled over the question when it came up in debates or interviews.' Axelrod writes that he recalls Obama telling him: 'I'm just not very good at bulls****ing' – a claim that Republicans would dispute. Ultimately it was Vice President Joe Biden who flushed his boss out, saying on the Sunday morning 'Meet the Press' talk show that he was 'absolutely comfortable' with the idea of gay marriage. WIth that, Obama had to come forward. 'Every single American – gay, straight, lesbian, bisexual, transgender – every single American deserves to be treated equally in the eyes of the law and in the eyes of our society,' he said at an annual dinner of the Human Rights Campaign, America's leading gay-rights group. FULL CIRCLE: Obama publicly said in 2012 what he had believed for years – that he backed marriage rights for homosexuals . And on May 9, 2012 in an interview with ABC News, he said: 'I've just concluded that for me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married.' Last month during an interview with a YouTube celebrity, the president said he hopes the U.S. Supreme Court will issue a ruling this year that would prevent states from banning gay marriage. 'I'm hopeful the Supreme Court comes to the right decision,' he said. Axelrod's recollections might be taken with a grain of salt, since the first published excerpt from his book focused on a story that was later labeled 'ridiculous' and a 'lie.' BELIEVABLE? Axelrod's book has already stirred controversy with a story about Mitt Romney that the former Republican nominee's closest personal aide says is a 'lie' He claimed that during a post-election concession phone call in 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney hinted to Obama that he won primarily on the strength of black voter turnout in inner cities. 'You really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like Cleveland and Milwaukee,' Romney told the president, according to Axelrod's version of events. But Romney's personal aide Garrett Jackson said he was in the room, listening to Romney's end of the conversation, and nothing like that conversation ever occurred. The revelation appeared timed to affect the public standing of Romney if he had decided to run for president again in 2016. Ultimately, the former Massachusetts governor opted to stay on the sidelines. 'I just hope this lie is the work of David Axelrod and not the president,' Jackson told CBS. 'It's ridiculous. I was very disappointed they would make that up.' Obama's sit-down with Buzzfeed is the latest in a series of occasions where the White House has given liberals in nontraditional media outlets rare access to the leader of the free world. Last month three YouTube celebrities interviewed Obama, including one comedienne best known for eating Fruit Loops while sitting in a bathtub filled with milk and the cereal. The folllowing day the president spoke with Vox, a newish left-wing website known for 'Voxsplaining' news concepts – and attracting digital slaps from people eager to correct its mistakes. Buzzfeed's interview also covered topics related to Russia, the 2016 elections, the death of ISIS hostage Mayle Mueller, and companies' reactions to restrictions placed on them by the Affordable Care Act.","President told a newspaper in 1996 when he first ran for office that he supported gay marriage; two years later  his answer changed to 'undecided'

"Notorious 'serial stowaway' Marilyn Hartman has been accused of posing as a guest checking in for a Biggest Loser weight-loss program at a Florida resort after she snuck onto a flight from Minnesota on Sunday. The 63-year-old California resident was arrested on Monday in Jacksonville, Florida, and she appeared in a Nassau County courtroom on Tuesday. She was ordered held in lieu of $55,000 bail and her next court date is March 5. Hartman’s latest adventure began on Sunday, when she  boarded a Delta Air Lines plane at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport without a ticket or boarding pass, authorities said. She's baaack! Notorious 'serial stowaway' Marilyn Jean Hartman, 63, was arrested in Florida after allegedly sneaking onto a flight and then checking into a posh resort using someone else's name . On arriving in Jacksonville she was driven to the Omni Amelia Island Plantation Resort after claiming that she was Maria Sandgren. Using the fake name, Hartman checked into an exclusive $300-a-night villa. But her triumph was short-lived and she fled hours later when the real guest - a participant in the resort’s Biggest Loser weight-loss program, which is affiliated with the popular TV program of the same name — showed up. The fleet-footed senior citizen was discovered by security guards on Monday hiding in a vacant room that was been renovated, reports NBC News. Hartman has been charged with felony fraud, defrauding an innkeeper and misdemeanor trespassing. The stowaway's long criminal record lists numerous similar incidents involving boarding flights without a ticket and entering places under false pretense. In August 2014 alone she was arrested no fewer than three times. Hartman has blamed her penchant for sneaking onto planes on an unrecognized medical condition she calls 'whistleblower trauma syndrome'. According to the woman, she was a whistleblower who was forced by the FBI to flee her home, forcing her to live on the streets. Police picked her up at Sky Harbor International Airport on August 26 on suspicion of criminal trespass after officials noticed her loitering near the baggage claim. Repeat offender: In August 2014, Hartman was arrested no fewer than three times, including at Phoenix airport . Just two weeks earlier, Hartman had been ordered to spend 117 days in jail for a probation violation after she was spotted at Los Angeles International Airport. A court had banned from the premises just days earlier. However Hartman - who is said to have a 'fixation' on airports because they make her feel safe - was released from Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood on August 16 - just three days later - due to overcrowding. After her August arrest in Phoenix, the 63-year-old wondered aloud at a press conference, 'Why has the government allowed me to get past security points?' Hartman, who has made previous attempts . to sneak aboard flights at other airports, was arrested on August 4 after successfully taking a Southwest Airlines flight from San Jose to Los Angeles without a . ticket. At Mineta San Jose International Airport, Hartman tried at least three times to get to a plane before she finally went past a security screener who was busy checking a family's documents, law enforcement officials said. She later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of willfully and unlawfully entering Los Angeles as a stowaway on an aircraft and was sentenced to two years probation. Her boarding status was discovered once the Southwest flight landed in Los Angeles, the officials said. Hartman later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of willfully and unlawfully entering Los Angeles as a stowaway on an aircraft. A judge ordered her to stay away from LAX unless she had a valid ticket. Outside . the courthouse after sentencing, Hartman said she would never try to sneak . onto a plane again. 'It was stupid, and it is something I don't want to . repeat,' she said. She added, 'Obviously they'll be on watch for me so I wouldn't dare attempt this again. I don't want to be that position. I want to go with a paid ticket,' reported News4Jax at the time. However, . Los Angeles Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said he had a feeling . the woman 'with a fixation on flying' would return to LAX, so police . passed out fliers with her picture. Can't stop: Hartman was sentenced to 18 months probation for attempting to board three Hawaii-bound flights last year. She spent three days in jail . 'She was (then) seen wandering through several terminals in what appeared to be a scouting mission,' he said. In February, Hartman was sentenced to 18 months' probation in San Mateo County after being arrested for attempting to board three Hawaii-bound flights at San Francisco International Airport on three separate days. Her breach of security at the San Jose airport caused federal officials and the airline to launch investigations. It also prompted criticism of the airport in light of the trespassing of a teenage boy who stowed away in the wheel well of a Hawaiian Airlines flight and survived an arduous journey to Maui. Hartman, who authorities say has a history of mental illness, has now been arrested eight times for trespassing at airports this year - though this is the first time she's been caught after successfully boarding a flight. She said last week that homelessness drove her to take 'desperate measures,' and that she feels safer being in airports than in the streets. San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said that Hartman has no family and has never married. According to a her blog, found by the San Francisco Chronicle, she has lived in sketchy motels and squalid apartments from Seattle to San Diego in the last few years. Records indicate Hartman was arrested November 6, 2010, at the Lihue Airport in Kauai after trespassing into the baggage claim area, the Chronicle reported. She was charged with simple trespass, but failed to show up for court hearings - and remains the subject of a bench warrant. Plane fixation: Hartman tried at least three times to breach airport security before she was able to get through a checkpoint without a boarding pass at Mineta San Jose International Airport  August 4 . According to the newspaper, Hartman said in her blog that she had successfully hopped a plane once before. She was found out and detained - but later released without charge. In May - after being arrested seven times at San Francisco International Airport - Hartman was placed in a mental treatment program but she stopped attending last month. 'She declined all of our efforts to offer her assistance,' Wagstaffe said. 'And we tried all of the alternatives we had because we weren't interested in locking her up on our end.' Then she went back to the San Francisco airport, but Wagstaffe's office declined to file charges after her seventh arrest in July for another failed attempt. On Monday, Hartman was only caught after the plane landed at Los Angeles International Airport and the crew counted the passengers who remained on board for the final destination to Phoenix. She was hauled off the plane and charged with trespassing by the Los Angeles Police Department.","Marilyn Jean Hartman, 63, was arrested in Jacksonville, Florida, on charges of fraud and trespassing on Monday .

"A rural township in south-central Pennsylvania is letting motorists know it's not a gun-free zone. LNP reported Thursday that Conoy Township - just south of Harrisburg - is spending about $500 on the group of signs. Four of them have been installed, with 12 more in the works.

"Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush once tangled with a Miami Herald reporter over media coverage of his daughter Noelle's drug-related legal troubles, complaining in an email that 'I wish the media would leave my daughter alone.' Noelle was arrested in 2002 at age 25 for prescription drug fraud, stealing pills at a rehab clinic, and possession of crack cocaine. A feeding frenzy of Florida journalists scrambled to report on every angle of the story, including links between a judge overseeing her rehab progress and a charity that received state government money. The implication was that Noelle, who spent less than two weeks in jail overall, received special treatment because her judge appreciated the grants – $900,000 in all – made to the charity on whose board he had sat. Bush wrote directly to the reporter in January 2003, and his email was part of a massive data dump he released to the public on Friday, redefining political transparency in the run-up to the 2016 election. 'LEAVE MY DAUGHTER ALONE': Jeb Bush emailed a Miami Herald reporter in 2003 to complain about how she was covering his daughter's drug-related court appearances . Noelle Bush, daughter of Florida's then-governor Jeb Bush, was originally arrested for trying to fill a Xanax prescription written to someone else . The trove of electronic data, more than 8 gigabytes in all, immediately attracted critiism, though, for the taxpayers' private information it contained. Daily Mail Online conducted a complete search of the data and identified 14 separate Social Security numbers. Most of the emails containing the word 'Noelle' were from well-wishers, with a majority saying they were praying – many every day – for her. 'It won't matter in the whole scheme of things,' Bush scolded the journalist on January 15, 2003, 'but I wish the media would leave my daughter alone. It would make it a whole lot easy [sic] for her to recover and live a life full of hope and promise.' Pointing out what he saw as a tenuous connection between the judge and the government grants, the exasperated governor sniped that 'based on your definition of possible conflict, I guess I should not subscribe to the Herald so you and your colleagues can report objectively.' 'It is that trivial,' he added in a follow-up email after the reporter defended herself. 'The only reason you wrote the piece, or were told to write the piece, is that my struggling daughter is the child of the Governor.' Noelle Bush was first taken into custody at a drive-through pharmacy window while her father was governor in January 2002, charged with trying to buy the often abused anti-anxiety drug Xanax with a prescription written for someone else. Although a judge gave her a break and sent her to an inpatient drug treatment program, and said her criminal charge could be dropped if she succeeded, she was caught at the facility with pills that had been stolen from a cabinet. She spent two days in jail. Back at the treatment center, workers found her with a 0.2 gram rock of crack cocaine concealed in her shoe two months later. In October 2002 at a progress hearing, a judge sent Noelle to jail for 10 days, basing his decision in part on news of the crack incident. Jeb Bush learned of the jail sentence while campaigning for re-election. From the day the cocaine was found, through his daughter's sentencing, he played the part of compassionate father while carefully maintaining the tough-on-crime image that made him popular politically. When news of the crack bust reached news media, he said his daughter needed to 'resolve in her heart and mind that she needs to change. She needs to accept responsibility,' he insisted. 'She knows that we love her,' the then-governor and re-election candidate continued. 'She knows a whole lot of people care for her, but it is up to her. There are no excuses.' Weeks later when Noelle was led away in handcuffs to begin her short stint behind bars, he addressed the growing media frenzy again. 'As governor, but most importantly as her father,' he said, 'I know she must face the consequences of her actions.' In one email to a sympathetic constituent, he wrote: 'Thank you katherine for your sympathies regarding Noelle. I love her more than life.' FAMILY MAN: Bush stood by his daughter, appearing with her in court despite being the sitting governor of Florida . REVOLVING DOOR: Ms. Bush was in and out of drug rehab with a few brief stays in jail as she struggled to get clean . Florida's open records laws are among the strongest in the nation, meaning the emails released Tuesday – all of those sent to and from Bush's personal email address from 1999 to 2007 – have long been open to public review. They account for a sliver of the Bush archive, and don't include emails sent to and from his official government email address, as well as other records such as office notes and calendars. But by cracking open his Blackberry for inspection on a new website, and pairing it with what amounts to a reader's guide to the hundreds of thousands of messages, many only a few words long, Bush is able to shape how the emails define him among his would-be GOP primary opponents and Democrats already trying to paint him as an out-of-touch businessman little different than 2012 nominee Mitt Romney. In a chapter of an e-book whose release accompanied the email data, Bush cast himself as being readily accessible, to the point that he freely gave his personal email address to constituents. 'As much as I could, I emailed back,' he writes, describing the experience as 'quite humbling' at times, but 'always eye opening, and (it) certainly kept me on my toes.'","Emails released Tuesday by the Florida governor show a father frustrated by reporters' eagerness to cover his daughter's legal woes .

"A taxi driver cheated death after thugs threw a 5ft wooden stake off a bridge which speared through his windscreen and missed his head by millimetres. Mohammed Banaris and two passengers in the back were showered with glass as the post with nails in it came to rest on his shoulder. All were badly shaken but uninjured, and Mr Banaris managed to pull over safely after the missile was launched from a bridge over the busy A5009 in Abbey Hulton, Staffordshire. Lucky escape: Taxi driver Mohammed Banaris sits behind the wheel of his car, where he was sitting when a huge wooden stake thrown by thugs speared his windscreen and missed his head by mere milimetres . Missile: The stake came to rest of Mr Banaris's shoulder after it was thrown at his car from a bridge . Father of three Mr Banaris, 37, from Lightwood, Stoke-on-Trent, said yesterday: 'The plank just missed my head, it could have killed me. 'It had nails sticking out of it too. 'As I went past the bridge, bang, the piece of wood came straight through my windscreen. 'There was a man and woman in the back of the cab and we were all covered in shattered glass. 'Luckily, I was going about 30mph and there was no other traffic around. It was dark though so I didn't see anyone up on the bridge. 'There was a lot of shock. It's extremely lucky no-one was seriously hurt. I've been told a group of youths threw the wooden post. Angry: Mr Banaris was unhurt but the missile broke his rear view mirror and smashed his windscreen, which must be repaired before he can work again . 'My passengers lived in the area and they said they get young people chucking things down from the bridge all the time. 'The police said it's been happening for the last couple of months. 'It could have been so much worse. I have heard of people throwing stuff off the bridge before but I've never actually seen anything like that.' The incident left Mr Banaris uninjured but with a broken rear view mirror as well as a smashed windscreen. He has been unable to work since the incident, which has left him badly shaken. He added: 'The damage has cost a couple of hundred pounds but on top of that I missed the weekend shift which is always good for money. 'It's really frustrating because the windscreen won't be fixed until Wednesday so I won't be able to get back to work until the end of this week.' A Staffordshire Police spokesman said: 'The wooden post shattered the windscreen of the taxi, which was travelling from Milton towards Northwood. 'It narrowly missed the driver and the occupants in the rear seats.. 'There were no injuries but the passengers and the driver were clearly shaken. 'The local policing team are investigating and are appealing to anyone who may have information on the incident.' Witness Graham Cayzer, who lives on Leek Road, said: 'The taxi pulled up in the lay-by adjacent to my house. 'There were three people stood around the vehicle and the police came. 'It's lucky the plank didn't catch the driver straight in the face.' The bridge from which the stake was thrown: Just two days before the attack on Mr Banaris's car, a brick was thrown from the same spot and damaged another passing car. Now locals are calling for CCTV . The dangerous act came just two days after a brick was thrown from the same bridge and damaged another passing car last Wednesday evening. Residents living in the area are now calling for CCTV to be introduced. Paul Bate, 67, who also lives on Leek Road, said: 'I've lived here since 1985 and this sort of thing goes on. 'About three months ago, I saw a group of teenage girls throwing stones off the bridge, so I shouted at them and they ran off. 'This is the most serious incident of this type in my time here. 'It's tough to police, a lot of young people use the bridge as a shortcut from school, but CCTV cameras might help to catch the culprits.'","Mohammed Banaris and his passengers showered with glass in the attack .

"It combines two cooking methods that have transformed family meal times and can deliver a tasty curry or chilli con carne in just 20 minutes. It is a pressure cooker that slides into a microwave and cooks everything from raw meat to jams, marmalades and steam puddings at incredibly high temperatures. The net effect is a super-fast cooking machine that could even replace the supermarket ready meal. The Lakeland microwave pressure cooker (pictured above) combines the convenience of microwave cooking with the speed and nutrient-retaining efficiency of pressure cooking without the need for pans or the stove . Any normal pan on the hob will cook at no more than boiling point of 100°C, however pressure cookers lock in the steam which means the cooking temperature is even higher. The traditional pressure cooker is a heavy metal contraption with locking lid that sits on top of the cooker hob, locking in the steam or cooking sauces in order to generate high temperatures. If using a microwave or a pressure cooker is too basic for you, then a new kitchen 'robot' could allow you to produce some more ambitious dishes. Sous-vide cooks food by slowly poaching it inside airtight bags for hours on end . Now the Mellow kitchen gadget will allow you to start the process before you even  get home. The device is able to take instructions from a mobile phone app so busy home cooks can start the process before they get home. The machine keeps food at refrigerator temperatures and can warm up within ten minutes to temperatures of up to 90°C. Using a mobile phone, it is possible to tell the device when to start cooking, how hot and for how long. It will even suggest cooking sequences according to the ingredients being used and how the user would like them to taste. The metal means that any attempt to put it into a microwave would very likely result in an explosion that could wreck a kitchen. However, the new version is similar in design, other than it is made from sturdy plastic, which means that it can go in the microwave oven to turn up the speed another notch. For example, while it takes 30 minutes to cook a chilli con carne in the standard metal version it is possible to cut this to around 20 in the microwave safe version – just because the ingredients heat up more quickly. It could take as long as one and three-quarter hours to make a steamed sponge pudding in a normal pan on the hob. This can be cut to around 50 minutes in a conventional pressure cooker and little as five in the new gadget. Boiling up a saucepan on water on top of the cooker for vegetables uses a lot of water and can result in important vitamins and minerals being leached away. The pressure cooking process minimises the cooking time and uses much less liquid. The £34.99 gadget is from Lakeland, which is renowned for kitchen innovations, where a spokesman said: ‘This is a healthy way to cook as vitamins and minerals are not dissolved so readily by the water. The gadget can cut the cooking time of foods such as chicken (pictured above) potatoes and sponge pudding . This graphic shows how the microwave pressure cooker is constructed to lock in the heat as food cooks . ‘Pressure cooking in a microwave is a new and unique method of cooking. It offers the speed of the microwave without the rubbery textures people associate with that method of cooking.’ However, the company admits it is not necessarily a one-pot solution for cooking the evening meal. It suggests that meat used in its dishes should be browned in a pan first to add colour and flavour, while the sauces are likely to need thickening after cooking with a mix of water and cornflour. A recipe book with the gadget suggests frozen peas can be cooked in 2-3 minutes; cauliflower florets in 3-4 and new potatoes in 5-6. All these timings are based on using a relatively low power 700 watt microwave. Lakeland said the concept has been popular in Japan and the firm has now brought it to the UK for the first time. The spokesman said: ‘We know that our customers love to create beautifully home-cooked food at home, but we also know that they don’t always have the time,’ she said. ‘Combining the convenience of a microwave and the speed of a pressure cooker, customers will be able to create tasty, intensely flavoured home-made dishes with the same convenience of a ready meal. This really will make home cooking quicker than ever before.’ Microwave ovens have proved popular for their convenience since they first went on the market in 1946 .","Device can cut the time it takes to make a steamed sponge to five minutes .

"An elementary school bus driver decided she was 'done' and walked off the job, leaving more than 50 Texas children stranded on the side of the road.

A Texas bus driver left her route while driving kids home from Barrow Elementary School in Brazoria . The driver, whose name has not been released, said she was 'done' and has since resigned from her job . After she left the bus on the side of County Road 724 last week, the children were stuck for about 30 minutes . When the driver stormed off just three stops into the route, she left the keys in the ignition. Her abrupt stop also caused some of the children - ranging from preschoolers to sixth graders - to fly forward into the seats in front of them. Some children were so upset that they cried to the point of becoming ill, KHOU reported. Haleigh, a fifth grader said: 'She was driving and she slammed on the brakes really hard and she unbuckled her seat belt and she was like, ""I'm done!"" and she just walked off the bus.' One student reported seeing a girl with 'throw up going all down her side' and a boy 'shaking his butt off'. Before she left the kids, the bus driver was talking on her phone and said: 'I'm done.

"North Korea has released an official image of its new 'stealth' ship-destroyer in a clear warning to both South Korea and the U.S. that is able to launch deadly attacks on their vessels without warning. State-run media said the high-speed cross between a catamaran and hovercraft was the result of a 10-year project and would enable it to attack any naval vessels North Korea considers to be a threat. The air-cushioned ships are  equipped with a rigid, faceted hull, allowing it to efficiently bounce along the surface of the ocean while also limiting its radar presence - making it incredibly difficult for target vessels to detect the ship-destroyer before it launches its deadly sea-skimming missiles. Scroll down for video . Blast: North Korea has released this official image of its new 'stealth' ship-destroyer in a clear warning to both South Korea and the U.S. that is able to launch deadly attacks on their vessels without warning . State-run media said the high-speed cross between a catamaran and hovercraft was the result of a 10-year project and would enable it to attack any naval vessels North Korean leader Kim Jong Un considers a threat . Specific details of North Korea's new 131 foot long ship-destroyer are thin, but it is understood to have been fitted with small propeller fans to allow it to reach high speeds of approximately 100mph - double the top speed of the navy's second fastest hovercraft. In terms of firepower, the ship-destroyer is thought to boast powerful Russian-made sea-skimming missiles called the KH-35 Uran, versions of which have a range of 135 nautical miles and have been compared with the U.S. Navy's Harpoon missile. North Korea did not reveal detail of the maximum range of its KH-35 Uran missiles, though it did claim that during testing a ship-destroyer hit and sunk a target ship from more than 60 miles away. For closer combat the ship-destroyer is fitted with two North Korean AK-630 30mm Gatling guns, four machine gun turrets and an anti-aircraft missile system, according to Ars Technica. The ship-destroyer is the latest in a long line of hovercraft-type ship to be developed by the North Korean navy and there understood to be at least two more such vessels still in development. Details of the ship-destroyer came as the South Korean navy carried out joint exercises with the U.S. military . Details of North Korea's new ship-destroyer came just two days after it test-fired five short-range missiles into the sea and after South Korean navy performed joint exercises with the United States . Details of North Korea's new ship-destroyer came just two days after it test-fired five short-range missiles into the sea - the second such weapons test conducted by Pyongyang this year - amid dimming prospects for the resumption of high-level talks between with its rival South Korea. The missiles, fired from a North Korean coastal town, flew about 125 miles before landing in waters off the country's east coast, a South Korean Defense Ministry official said on condition of anonymity, citing department rules. North Korea routinely tests missiles, rockets and artillery, but the latest launches came with the two Koreas at odds over terms for a possible summit meeting between their leaders. The two countries last month floated the idea of the summit, which would be the third such meeting since they were divided 70 years ago. Last year, the North conducted an unusually large number of missile and other weapons tests, drawing protests from South Korea. The North still proposed a set of measures that it said would lower tensions, but South Korea rebuffed them, saying the country must first take steps toward nuclear disarmament. The Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.","Pyongyang said high speed ship-destroyer project was 10 years in making .

"Eva Herzigova was launched into super-stardom when she became the face of Wonderbra in 1994. Now Danish-born model Sølveig Mork is hoping to follow the same trajectory as she is announced as the latest face behind the lingerie brand. You may not know her name yet, by joining an alumni that includes Dita Von Teese and Miranda Kerr Sølveig is bound to become a household name. Scroll down for video . Danish-born model Sølveig Mork has been unveiled as the latest face of Wonderbra . Photographed by Lee Broomfield, the brunette beauty will exclusively model the Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter 2015 ranges.

Sølveig's modelling career is on the rise, with a number of high profile campaigns already under her belt, and the brand are now hoping that she will steer them to a new era of elegant maturity. After being discovered at just 14-years-old, by Unique Copenhagen Models, Sølveig's first job was for Eurowoman magazine. She has since graced the covers of ELLE Italie, Grazia France and Sports Illustrated. Sølveig was discovered at just 14, by Unique Copenhagen Models and her first job was at for Eurowoman magazine . The brunette will follow in the footsteps of celebrity models like Dita Von Teese and Miranda Kerr . Standing tall at 5ft 9in, Sølveig has walked the catwalk for Maybelline, Charlotte Ronson, Kaufmanfranco and Adam Selman. Martina Alexander, Marketing Manager at Wonderbra, says she hopes that Sølveig will bring an elegant edge to the brand. She said: 'We're very excited to announce Sølveig as our new model for the 2015 season. 'She embodies the sophisticated spirit of the collections and looks stunning in the new Glam and My Pretty Push-Up styles.' Eva Herzigova . The Wonderbra name was first trademarked in the U.S. in 1955, and the brand was developed in Canada over the next 40 years. But it only really gained worldwide prominence in the 1990s. The bra's redesign and reintroduction in 1994 saw a £16m advertising campaign in the US and UK including billboards showing Eva Herzigova wearing the Wonderbra. Wonderbra's iconic Hello Boys advert was the 1994 billboard that - quite literally - stopped traffic. Makers of the ad were honoured in 2011, when the billboard was declared the most eye-catching ad of the previous 20 years. Dita Von Teese . The queen of burlesque launched a stunning collection of retro underwear for Wonderbra in 2008. At the time Dita, explained that the Wonderbra range was inspired by the glamour of the 1940s and 50s. She said: 'I love it when you can go about your daily business with the knowledge that you have a little secret of your own on underneath.' Dita added that her range was less of a 'Hello Boys' collection as it was designed for women to enjoy rather than something for their lover. She said: 'Lingerie shouldn't be something you just put on for your lover; you should do it for you. 'It's not about seducing men, it's about embracing womanhood.' Miranda Kerr . In March last year, the Australian model was revealed as the ambassador for the brand and has since shot some extremely racy shots as part of her ongoing contract.

"Scotland Yard chief Bernard Hogan Howe said it was time for the police to get a pay rise . Britain's top cop Bernard Hogan Howe has said it is time for the police to get a pay rise. The Scotland Yard chief said police officers had been hit by years of pay freezes and had seen their standard of living deteriorate 'like everybody else'. His remarks came in response to David Cameron's call for businesses to hand their staff a pay rise in a major speech today. Sir Bernard, appearing on LBC radio this morning, was also grilled on Scotland Yard's  battle to combat terrorism. But the Scotland Yard chief was left red-faced after forgetting the number of the anti-terror hotline set up for people to report their concerns about extremism. It came after he was asked by a caller what he made of the Prime Minister's urge for pay rises. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner said: 'I think it's a very good idea, particularly for police officers.' He added: 'I think the point he is making … is that as business costs reduce through fuel and other things, our interest rates down that some of the profits that have been made should be shared with their staff. 'Well I don't suppose that applies to the police but it's certainly true that our officers and staff have seen fixed salaries now for a number of years and like everyone else has seen their standard of living deteriorate. 'So anything that would help them I support. And if that, if it's possible to get a pay rise of course we'd support it.' Sir Bernard said the police had only received a below-inflation 1 per cent pay rise last year after 'two to three years of a pay freeze' following the 2008 recession. He added: 'I think it would be helpful, particularly with the London property market, to make sure that you know our officers are properly rewarded.' The police chief's intervention came after Mr Cameron urged booming businesses to pass on their profits in bigger pay cheques to their staff. In an attempt to create an election feed-good factor, the Prime Minister insisted trading conditions in Britain have 'not been this good for a long time', and it is time employees saw wage rises after years of a squeeze living conditions. It comes as a sharp fall in oil prices is helping to fuel the fastest growth in the UK economy since before the financial crisis. The Prime Minister was accused of hypocrisy after calling for a pay rise for private sector workers, while overseeing continuing wage restraint in the public sector . Bernard Hogan Howe was left red-faced this morning after admitting he could not remember the anti-terrorism hotline number he has urged Londoners to use. The Metropolitan Police commissioner  was asked to repeat the freephone number by LBC host Nick Ferrari after a former serviceman called in to say he had not seen it publicised. Sir Bernard said: 'At this second I must admit I haven't got it with me - it's an 0800 number, so it's free ... Every other time I've been in (to the LBC phone-in) I think I have actually mentioned it. 'You could argue it's an unmemorable number.' The commissioner was later informed the hotline number is 0800 789 321. He added: 'It's ascending and descending numbers. It is probably not that easy to remember - as I've just highlighted.' Latest figures show that average wages rose by 1.8 per cent in the year to November, while the CPI rate of inflation stands at just 0.5 per cent. Mr Cameron said: 'The most recent figures show that wages are already growing faster than inflation, and as the economy continues to grow it's important this continues and that everyone benefits. Put simply – it's time Britain had a pay rise.' But it comes after years of prices rising faster than pay, leaving families worse off each month. Critics accused the government of double standards, because pay in the public sector has been frozen or slated to rise by just 1 per cent. Unions claim the average wage is worth £2,500 less a year as a result of pay failing to keep pace with inflation. The TUC's general secretary Frances O'Grady dismissed Mr Cameron's call as 'no more than pre-election mood music'. She said: 'Since David Cameron became Prime Minister, the average wage is worth £2,500 less a year, the worst fall in living standards since Queen Victoria was on the throne. 'Saying it would be nice if wages went up is no more than pre-election mood music. If elected again his policies would do the opposite. 'Huge cuts would take spending back to the same share of the economy as in the 1930s. This would depress the economy and mean public sector wages would fall every year. On top of that he would make strikes almost impossible, holding back pay across every sector.' Unite general secretary Len McCluskey added: 'If Cameron was serious about giving Britain a pay rise then he'd put his money where his mouth is and immediately boost the minimum wage by at least £1.50 an hour with the promise of a living wage. Instead we have empty words, which don't put food on the table or pay the rent.' Unison's general secretary Dave Prentis said: 'If Jeremy Hunt was following David Cameron's lead, he would have implemented the NHS pay review body's recommendations in full last month.' The round-the-clock police operation to guard fugitive WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is a drain on taxpayers' money and is being reviewed, the UK's most senior officer has said. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe told LBC radio that the force is assessing its options due to the pressure the operation at the Ecuadorian embassy in London is putting on resources. He said: 'We won't talk about tactics but we are reviewing what options we have. It is sucking our resources.' Police presence outside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where Julian Assange, The WikiLeaks founder is in hiding . Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has been at the embassy since June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden where he faces questions over claims of sexual assaults . Mr Assange has been at the embassy since June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden where he faces questions over claims of sexual assaults, which he denies. Last week Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the cost of the operation was around the £10 million mark. Australian Mr Assange came under intense scrutiny after WikiLeaks began releasing a selection of more than 250,000 classified US diplomatic cables passed to the whistle-blowing website back in 2010. Mr Assange's supporters last year pondered whether he was to end his self-imposed embassy stay amid concerns over his long-term health.","Bernard Hogan Howe said police officers 'particularly' deserved a pay rise .

"It was time for Malcolm Butler to take a(nother) victory lap on Tuesday. Capping off an event-packed week following the New England Patriots' Super Bowl win, the cornerback took possession of his brand new truck. The Chevy Colorado was given to him by quarterback Tom Brady, who won it after being named MVP of the game - and Chevy responded by giving Brady his own car, too. 'I am ecstatic that Chevrolet has chosen to reward me with a Colorado,' Butler said, according to TMZ. 'It is just another unreal event in what has been an incredible week.' Scroll down for video . Oh hey: New England Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler poses with a Chevrolet pickup truck he was presented Tuesday, February 10, 2015, at a dealership in Norwood, Massachusetts . Ecstatic: The truck was intended to go to Patriots quarterback Tom Brady as Super Bowl Most Valuable Player. But Brady  determined Butler should receive it in recognition for his game-saving interception . Over the moon: Butler throws his keys in the air to celebrate receiving the car . Fan: New England Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler , signs an autograph for Matthew Mourad, right, of Walpole, Massachusetts, after Butler accepted the keys to a Chevrolet truck Tuesday . Butler is credited with turning a possible Patriots loss into a definite Patriots victory when he intercepted Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson on the one-yard-line with just 20 seconds left in the game. The play was so big in fact, and so crucial to the Patriots victory, that many felt Butler would be taking home MVP honors for the evening. In the end though, it went to the man who two interceptions that night, and two previous MVP trophies - Tom Brady. Now both will be winners in their shiny new cars. Nice boss: Tom Brady (above) decided to split his Super Bowl MVP prize with Malcom Butler . Game-clinching move: The Seahawks' badly-judged slant pass was intercepted by Butler (pictured) at the Patriots' zone on Sunday . The Chevrolet Colorado retails for about $20,000. Many outside the organization are surprised by Butler's rise from virtually unknown to post-season legend, his teammates have been seeing this kind of work and smart play in practice all season. 'He’s been doing it to me in practice all season so it was nice to see him pick someone else off,' joked Brady. This after Brady said as he received his MVP award; 'Malcolm made a huge play to save our season. It was the perfect play at the perfect time. None of us will ever forget that play.' Brady decided to regift the free Chevrolet Colorado pickup he got - worth about $20,000 . Vince Wilfork, the most respected member of the team's defense, echoed Brady's statement, saying; 'That is just one of those things that is so fitting for him just because of how he worked himself into playing time.' Butler's play was not just a win for the Patriots either, with his uplifting story and remarkable play providing the NFL with one of the few positive stories to come out of the league during this scandal-plagued season and ending things on a very high not. Brady added a few more records to his legacy on Sunday well as he now has the most Super Bowl appearances (six), the most Super Bowl victories alongside Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana (four), and the most MVP trophies, again shared with Montana (three).","Tom Brady gave the Chevrolet Colorado he received for winning the Super Bowl MVP trophy to cornerback Malcolm Butler .

"A father who allegedly threw his five-year-old daughter to her death off a 60ft-high Florida bridge is mentally incompetent, according to two doctor evaluations. John Jonchuck is accused of throwing his daughter Phoebe off the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in St. Petersburg last month. After the doctors' statements were released this morning, court officials have said the competency hearing for Jonchuck will take place on February 17. Scroll down for video . John Jonchuck (left) who allegedly threw his five-year-old daughter Phoebe (right) to her death off a Florida bridge is said to be incompetent to stand trial, according to two doctor evaluations . Police say John Jonchuck pulled over on the Sunshine Skyway bridge in St Petersburg January 8, pulled Phoebe from the back seat and dropped her to her death . Memorials have been set up in honor of the late Phoebe. Twelve hours before her death, a child welfare operator failed to pass along a message from Jonchuck's lawyer about his mental state because she didn't think the child was in danger . During the official hearing, attorneys can debate the meaning of the evaluations given thus far, which have not been made public, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Before the case proceeds, the judge needs to decide whether Jonchuck understands the case against him. If he is ruled incompetent, he will be put into treatment and re-evaluated at a later date in hopes that treatment would make him mentally capable to stand trial. Jonchuck’s history of mental-health issues has been raised as one of several warning signs outlined in a Department of Children and Families (DCF) report, according to Fox Tampa Bay. The department revealed that it had received several calls from Jonchuck’s divorce lawyer regarding his mental state. Just 12 hours before he allegedly threw his daughter to her death, his own lawyer called a state child abuse hotline warning that his client was suffering from mental delusions. But according to documents released by child welfare officials on Monday, the hotline operator failed to pass on the call to investigators because she didn't think the child was in danger. One week prior to the lawyer's call, another worried caller told the Department of Children and Families that Jonchuck's daughter Phoebe had been physically abused in the past . The casket of Phoebe Jonchuck is carried out after memorial services at Lake Magdalene Methodist Church in Tampa last month . One week earlier, another worried caller told the Department of Children and Families that Jonchuck's daughter Phoebe had been physically abused in the past. That call, however, also failed to get to DCF investigators because the operator hung up before she got John Jonchuck's address. Instead of calling back, she simply closed the case, according to the state's investigation. The lapses have cast the already troubled DCF in a harsh spotlight, prompting new Secretary Mike Carroll to change hotline protocol. Going forward, if a caregiver seems to be experiencing a psychotic episode, a child protective investigator will be required to visit within four hours. Police say Phoebe Jonchuck was likely alive when her father sped past a police officer January 8, stopped on the Sunshine Skyway bridge in St Petersburg, pulled the girl from the back seat and dropped her to her death. He was arrested and accused of first-degree murder, but hasn't formally been charged as he is undergoing mental health evaluations. Jonchuck's own divorce lawyer had warned authorities of his mental state January 7, telling the hotline operator that Jonchuck had driven to three different churches in his pajamas with Phoebe in tow and asked his attorney to translate a Swedish Bible into English. Another worried caller told the Department of Children and Families a week before the bridge drama that Jonchuck's daughter Phoebe had been physically abused in the past . Jonchuck was also expressing paranoid fears that Phoebe was not his biological daughter, his lawyer said. 'He's calling the office every five minutes and saying these religious things and saying the child might not be his, it just really concerns me,' the unidentified attorney told an operator, later adding, 'It's all craziness and it doesn't make any sense and he's out of his mind.' But the report noted the relatively inexperienced operator said the caller seemed more worried about Jonchuck's mental state, not the child's safety and labeled the call as 'inadequate supervision' and did not turn it over to investigators. The attorney even noted that DCF had an open investigation on the family, but the operator said she couldn't find the report and did not ask a supervisor, according to the state's investigation. The missing report came from a caller who alleged family violence, inadequate supervision and substance misuse at the Jonchuck home. 'We are reminded yet again that every process within our system should be critically examined at every opportunity to ensure that the role it plays is carried out effectively,' Carroll said in the report. Phoebe's mother Michelle Kerr is helped away from her daughter's funeral last month. Phoebe Jonchuck was in the custody of her father when he threw his child to her death . Ignoring calls has been a problem in the past and the hotline has undergone a multi-million dollar overhaul. Among the other problems uncovered in the investigation of Phoebe's death, Hillsborough County Sheriff's child protective investigators had 25 vacancies and were overwhelmed by the high number of new cases. Although the area has a network of nearby mental health, substance abuse and domestic violence resources, investigators don't routinely seek expert advice before closing cases, using the organizations only for referrals. Investigators also seemed more focused on whether Phoebe and her siblings' basic needs were being met, instead of addressing the histories of domestic violence, mental health, and substance abuse issues in the home, according to the report. DCF investigators have struggled over the years to look at the big picture in several other high-profile child abuse deaths. A call in June of 2013 first brought child investigators to the Jonchuck home where they closed the case, agreeing that family violence threatened Phoebe. Jonchuck was arrested as a result of the call after an altercation with Phoebe's mother. He and Phoebe later moved out of the home, but Monday's report noted that no services or interventions were put in place.","John Jonchuck is accused of the first-degree murder of his daughter Phoebe .

"Brodie Few, 26, (pictured outside court) handed himself after he realised the cuddly toy he stole was being auctioned off in memory of a cancer victim . A thief was so consumed by guilt after hearing a giant cuddly toy he stole from a garden centre was being raffled off for charity that he gave himself up to police. Brodie Few, 26, walked into a police station clutching the 4ft tall soft bear that he had taken from the store in Weymouth, Dorset, after a CCTV appeal was launched to track him down. He claimed he was unaware the teddy was being raffled off in honour of former staff member, Lyn Weaver, who had died of breast cancer two months before the theft. Staff at Goulds Garden Centre aimed to raise £1,000 for Cancer Research and were stunned when Few walked out of the store with the toy and a second prize - a slow cooker - under his arm. It was after Few spotted the CCTV appeal and was wracked with guilt at what he had done, a court heard. Ian Brazier, defending, told magistrates in Weymouth: 'He hadn't registered that the items were for a charity raffle. 'When he saw the CCTV images that is what we felt the worst about and registered that he was the person being sought.' Mr Brazier said Few suffered from epilepsy and a frontal lobe brain tumour which affects his memory. He pleaded guilty to a charge of theft at an earlier court hearing and District Judge Stephen Nicholls said he took this into account along with the fact he had returned the items to the police. He sentenced Few to a community order, a five-week curfew restricting him from leaving his home between the hours of 7pm and 7am and told to pay court costs and fines of £145. Anthony Gould, director at Goulds Garden Centre, said: 'All of the staff here were devastated and very angry when they learned that items from the charity raffle set up in Lyn's memory had been targeted by thieves. 'Lyn was a much loved colleague and it was beyond belief that anyone could sink as low as to steal from a display set up in memory of our colleague that was raising money for Cancer Research and Mosaic, a charity set up to support bereaved children. 'However those feelings were quickly overshadowed by an overwhelming sense of support. We were literally inundated with messages of support with many people and businesses donating raffle prizes to replace the ones stolen.' Goulds Garden Centre released the CCTV footage after thieves brazenly walked out of the store with the huge teddy bear and a slow cooker - that were due to be auctioned off for charities Cancer Research and Mosaic . Few can be seen admiring the bear in the CCTV footage, which he later spotted and feeling wracked with guilt, handed himself into police along with the items . The CCTV footage shows three other suspects who appear to have been working alongside Few. Mr Gould said: 'Despite the positive result, we are still left very disappointed that the other three people involved in the theft have yet to do the right thing and hand themselves in. 'They obviously have no conscious whatsoever and are quite happy for their so called friend to take all of the blame.' 'Rather than any prosecution it was more important to us that the friends, colleagues, family and acquaintances of these people all knew that that they were in fact common thieves quite happy to steal from a charity. A court heard he was unaware of the charity campaign when he took the items and suffered from epilepsy and a frontal lobe brain tumour which affects his memory . Few was given a community order, a five-week curfew restricting him from leaving his home between the hours of 7pm and 7am and told to pay court costs and fines of £145 .","Brodie Few, 26, walked into a police station clutching 4ft tall teddy bear .

"After losing his wife to cancer on Christmas Day, scientist Billy Boyle vowed to do all he could to help others who could be saved by an early diagnosis. And now, less than two months later, a cancer detector that Mr Boyle has invented will be trialled on the NHS – potentially saving up to 10,000 lives. His breathalyser – which sniffs out chemicals associated with a number of cancers, including lung and bowel – will be used in two hospitals this summer as part of a £1million clinical trial. Scroll down for video . Help: Billy Boyle, pictured with his late wife Kate Gross and their two sons Oscar and Isaac, has invented a cancer detector which sniffs out chemicals associated with a number of cancers to be trialled by the NHS . His wife Kate Gross – who had a successful career as an adviser to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown before founding a charity in Africa – died on Christmas Day last year aged 36 after a two-year battle with colon cancer. Mr Boyle said the loss of his ‘inspirational’ wife and the mother to his five-year-old twin boys had spurred him on to helping others be diagnosed and treated early. ‘Because of the experience of my wife and my family, we saw the devastation that cancer brings to families,’ he told Sky News. ‘You develop technologies for a reason. Sometimes it’s for monetary gain. Other times it’s to make a difference. And I think we have a real opportunity to try and improve the lives of patients. Tragic: Kate Gross died on Christmas Day last year, aged 36, after a two-year battle with colon cancer . ‘When my wife was sick, we talked about what motivated her, what motivates me. 'Knowing the conversations I had with her about how we can develop technology for the benefit of others is something that makes me walk into the office every day. It puts an extra spring in my step.’ The LuCID (lung cancer indicator detection) project he has helped develop analyses the chemicals present in a person’s breath. Diseases such as lung cancer produce minuscule but unique chemical traces. This can indicate illness long before symptoms become obvious, boosting the chances of survival. The survival rate for Stage 1 lung cancer is 75 per cent – for Stage 4 it is just 5 per cent. Mr Boyle said his goal is to save 10,000 lives. Dr Jonathan Bennet, a consultant respiratory physician at Glenfield Hostpial, Leicester, told Sky News: ‘If successful, this test could be delivered locally – for example at GP surgeries and pharmacies for people assessed at being high risk. 'We are looking forward to answering this question with this innovative study.’ Miss Gross wrote a poignant blog about her illness, which has since been made into a book entitled Late Fragments: Everything I Want to Tell You (About This Magnificent Life). On her final blog post, entitled ‘May Your Days Be Merry And Bright’, she said she was preparing to enjoy her last Christmas with her family. Her mother, Jean, said her daughter died with her husband by her side, just minutes before her sons asked if it was time to open their Christmas stockings.","Kate Gross died aged 36 after a two-year battle with colon cancer .

"Alberto Nisman (pictured) was discovered dead in his own apartment in January - a day before he was due to testify about his claims . Argentine investigators say they have found a second person's DNA in the apartment where prosecutor who had accused the country's president of a cover up was found dead. Prosecutor Alberto Nisman had accused President Cristina Fernandez of covering up Iran's alleged role in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish centre in Buenos Aires that left 85 dead. Nisman's body was discovered in an apartment in January - a day before he was due to testify about his claim that Fernandez sought to whitewash his findings that Iran was behind the attack on the centre, run by the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association. Following the DNA find today, Judge Fabiana Palmaghini is calling in a person who visited Nisman the day before his body was found. The judge's office does not name the witness, but Nisman's aide Diego Lagomarsino has acknowledged visiting him on January 17. Investigators say they don't yet know if Nisman committed suicide or was killed. Last week, it was reported that investigators are trying to track down former intelligence chief Antonio Stiusso in connection with Nisman's death, but are unsure if he is even in the country. 'He was not at any of the properties registered as his own,' Oscar Parrilli, head of the Intelligence Secretariat (SI), told . reporters. Iran has vigorously denied involvement in the bombing and . Fernandez has dismissed Nisman's findings as absurd. She said . Nisman was duped by rogue agents involved in a power struggle . and killed when he was no longer of value to them. One of those spies was Stiusso, Fernandez's government has . said. Fired during a December shake-up of the SI, Stiusso had . helped Nisman with his investigation of the bombing. 'I have no doubts that Stiusso is behind all this, after the . decision of (President Fernandez) to fire him from the SIDE,' Anibal Fernandez, the president's chief of staff, said on . Twitter on Tuesday, referring to the top spy agency by its . former name. Alberto Nisman had accused President Cristina Fernandez (pictured) of covering up Iran's alleged role in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish centre in Buenes Aires that left 85 dead .

Thee 1994 bombing of a Buenes Aires Jewish centre, run by the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association,  left 85 dead . Parrilli said secrecy laws would be lifted so thatinvestigators could grill Stiusso fully about the mysteriousevents leading up to Nisman's death. He said the presidentwanted 'the whole truth to be known.' Stiusso's spy career spanned four decades. He was one of the . most feared men in the intelligence agency, which played an . important role in the military government's 'dirty war' against . suspected Marxist rebels, union leaders and other leftists in . the 1970s. Since democracy was restored in 1983, successive governments . are widely believed to have continued to use the agency to snoop . on opponents. Stiusso, whose name is often spelled Stiuso in . Argentina, is believed to have been at the heart of its . wiretapping operations. '(Stiusso) is a key man given his ties to Alberto Nisman,' Gerardo Young, author of a book titled 'The Secret Argentina' on . the intelligence community, told television channel TN. 'He knew . perfectly what Nisman had been working on and surely knew of his . state of mind.' It remains unclear whether Nisman killed himself or was . murdered. No arrests have been made since Fernandez's remark two weeks . ago that renegade spies were behind the prosecutor's death. The scandal has dented the government's credibility ahead of .

"A father of newborn triplets has been arrested on a sex offender violation - just hours after going on TV to explain how he and his family had been left stranded in a motel with 'no way to get home'. Derrick Sessions, 37, who was wanted by police, was detained at the motel in Houston, Texas, on Tuesday morning after allegedly failing to maintain his sex offender registry status in the state. His status is related to a 1998 conviction for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl in Louisiana. The new father was arrested after a detective recognized him in a news report from the previous night. During the KHOU.com report, Sessions had explained how he, his pregnant wife, Vontivia Mitchell-Sessions, and their 13-month-old daughter had traveled from Orange to Houston in November.

Arrest: Derrick Sessions, 37, has been arrested on a sex offender violation - just hours after going on TV to explain how he and his family had been left stranded in a Texas motel. Above Sessions is arrested Tuesday . Interview: The suspect left) speaks to KHOU.com alongside his wife, Vontivia Mitchell-Sessions, and children . Convict: Sessions was detained at the motel in Houston on Tuesday after allegedly failing to maintain his sex offender registry status in the state.  Above, he is pictured in mug shots in 2014 (left) and 2007 (right) This was because it was the closest city with high-risk pregnancy doctors who accept Medicaid, said Sessions, who served a 10-year prison sentence for his 1998 crime, according to police records. Because Sessions is on unpaid leave from his job and Mrs Mitchell-Sessions is out of work, a case worker at The Woman's Hospital of Texas  reportedly paid for them to stay in a nearby motel. Two months later, the couple welcomed their triplets, Kaitlin, Shariyah and Derrick Jr, into the world prematurely. Shariyah was born with a small hole in her heart, while Derrick has a hernia. Doctors discharged the babies from the hospital this week, telling the parents they would need to visit specialists in Houston in coming months to treat the infants' serious medical conditions. Premature: During  his TV appearance, Sessions had explained how he and his wife had welcomed their triplets, Kaitlin, Shariyah (both pictured) and Derrick Jr  into the world prematurely four weeks ago . First child: Because Mr Sessions is on unpaid leave from his job and Mrs Mitchell-Sessions is out of work, the couple (pictured with their elder daughter) cannot afford to either stay in the city, nor return home, he said . But during his TV appearance, Sessions claimed the couple have no money to either stay in the city until these appointments, nor travel home and then return to Houston  to see the specialists. In fact, they have said they have no money to return to their Orange home, around 110 miles away, at all, he told reporters. 'We need housing,' Mr Sessions said, explaining how he and his wife had spent all of their savings on an SUV to carry the family home home without realizing it was too small to hold four car seats. 'We can't strap them in,' he added. 'My biggest fear is losing our babies. We need help.' Mrs Mitchell-Sessions is pictured posing alone (right) and with her husband (left) during her first pregnancy . Discharged: Doctors at The Woman's Hospital of Texas (pictured) discharged the babies this week, telling the Sessions they would need to visit specialists in Houston  to treat two of their babies' medical conditions . The Sessions, who wed 16 months ago, are believed to also have several older children. Because the hospital is no longer paying for their hotel room, they described their situation in the TV report as 'living on borrowed time'. They also claimed they are unable to pay their hospital bill. Following the news report, several people apparently reached out to help the desperate parents. KHOU.com has deleted its original story on the couple. It is unknown if Sessions - who would have been aged around 20 at the time of his sex crime - has been charged.

"Joshua Bonehill-Paine used his website to attack five victims and made false allegations about them . A former public schoolboy who described himself as a 'rising star of the right-wing community' and branded innocent people as paedophiles online has escaped a prison sentence. Joshua Mark Bonehill-Paine attacked five different victims by cloning their Facebook accounts, publishing 'wanted' posters and creating false allegations about them and posting them online. The 22-year-old, from Yeovil in Somerset, claimed people were paedophiles, homosexuals and held certain religious views - causing one of the victims to lose their business. Most of the abuse took place on his politically-motivated website, which he founded in 2013 to report 'on the truth to the interest of our readers and those who believe in nationalist change.' He was found guilty of six counts of malicious communication and handed a three month prison sentence, suspended for 18-months, when he appeared at Yeovil Magistrates Court on Monday. He reportedly spent the morning smirking in the dock and speaking outside the court said he had 'absolutely no remorse for them [the victims] whatsoever'. 'Well of course I have to [stay away from them] because I have been issued with a restraining order.' One of his victims, Richard Day, said how the abuse meant that he was unable to go outside and his business fell apart. He said: 'I noticed this chap bullying. They asked me to go and report him in court, hopefully being sentenced last Spring. He wasn't. 'He then put up a picture of me, and I am fairly distinctive, as a paedophile. He knows nothing about me. My business went under. 'For quite a long time I didn't really go outside except for necessities because it only takes on idiot looking through the internet to see that, perhaps a bit drunk or drugged up, and to stumble outside and see me, and not everybody looks like me, and I am dead in the gutter.' Last year, Bonehill-Paine received a community order for an internet hoax about a Leicester pub barring military personnel, forcing it to close. Richard Day was one of the victims and says that Bonehill-Paine falsely claimed he was a paedophile, which resulted in Day losing his business . In 2011, when he was still an 18-year-old student, Bonehill-Paine was convicted of stealing uniforms from a police station. He told a court he broke into the building and took the outfit, including body armour, baton and handcuffs, to keep warm after he was thrown out of his hotel. He used his Conservative Party membership card to flick the lock at Chard Police Station, in Somerset, and chanted 'your security is s***' when police tried to arrest him. Magistrates sentenced Bonehill-Paine to a 12-month community order - including 100 hours of unpaid work and supervision by the probation service - after admitting burglary and assault.","Joshua Bonehill-Paine, 22, attacked five different victims on the internet .

"A new breed of digital pickpocket has been discovered lurking in stations and shopping centres. They come armed with technology that can effortlessly steal credit and debit card details without so much as touching your wallet. Standing just six inches (15cm) away, these criminals use radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers  to harvest bank details in a practice known as ‘digital skimming’. Scroll down for video . If a readers or RFID-app enabled smartphone is within range, it can pick up the wireless signals transmitted when that card is being used to buy a product (left). David Bryan (right), a security specialist at Chicago's Trustwave, stood by crowded shopping areas with a device stashed in his backpack to show how it works . ABC7 I-Team recently revealed just how easily thieves  steal personal details from cards that use ‘wave and pay’ radio technology. David Bryan, a security specialist at Chicago's Trustwave, stood by crowded shopping areas with a device stashed in his backpack that could read card numbers. ‘The technology is high-frequency RFID,’ Mr Bryan told DailyMail.com. ‘It uses 13.56 Mhz to communicate with the card and the reader. ‘In this instance, I used low power Embedded Linux Computer, and an easily purchasable RFID reader. The technology in the card, known as radio frequency identification (RFID), transmits bank details via its own radio signal. A RFID reader can pick up these details in a matter of seconds .

Standing just six inches (15cm) away, these criminals use RFID readers or apps to harvest bank details in a practice known as ‘skimming’. If a readers or RFID-app enabled smartphone is within range, it can pick up the wireless signals transmitted when that card is being used to buy a product. The information can then be input into a machine that can be purchased for $300-$400 to replicate the card. Cards can be protected from RFID skimmers by being wrapped in tin foil or being kept in special foil-lined wallets. ‘This was then powered by a USB Battery, and stuck into a backpack.’ As well as a device, digital pickpockets can download an RFID app onto their phone. If a reader or RFID-app enabled smartphone is within range, it can pick up the wireless signals transmitted when that card is being used to buy a product. The information can then be input into a machine that can be purchased for $300-$400 to replicate the card. Security firm Norton says that this year 70 per cent of credit cards will be vulnerable to digital pick pocketing. ‘The device can read many different RFID tags- including MiFare Cards, EMV Cards, and many type of RFID tags,’ said Mr Bryan. ‘It works with many Near Field Communication tags and devices’ Because RFID is always switched on, some payment experts say it's more vulnerable to attack than NFC. 'This demonstration shows that contactless payment card reading technology is not a silver bullet for security,' said Mr Bryan. RFID readers can be bought cheaply online. They can also be downloaded onto a smartphone from an app . 'RFID payment cards need to be backed by a mobile device that generates one-time payment card numbers for that specific transaction- rather than having a static payment card that never expires. 'In a crowded train, if someone has an RFID payment card, I could easily pull that data if I get close enough - or have a large enough antenna' As well as using it in his backpack, Mr Bryan successfully stole numbers by attaching the equipment to a laptop. ‘The three digit code on the back of the card could help,’ Marc Rotenberg, President of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (Epic) told DailyMail.com. This code can’t be read by the device, but fake cards could be created without the three digit code and presented at shops. ‘We have some questions about the implementation [of the three digit code] because it wouldn’t make sense to implement it if you don’t require presentation of the product,’ said Mr Rotenberg. Places to watch out for digital pickpockets include crowded shopping centres and busy stations where transactions are constantly being made . Special wallets that use foil can block these radio frequency signals, but the threat remains very real. Apple Pay is attempting to overcome the problem by not storing any numbers on an iPhone. A Chase Bank spokesperson also told the ABC7 I-Team that they are discontinuing the use of that radio technology on their cards. ‘It’s not necessary wrong to pursue these techniques, but more needs to be done to safeguard people,’ said Mr Rotenberg. Articulate's clutch (right) blocks RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) signals - the relatively new technology that allows us to simply wave our credit cards over a scanner to pay for goods (left) A tech-savvy accessories label has launched a clutch purse with built-in capabilities to protect against identity theft. Articulate's clutch costs $35 to pre-order and blocks RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) signals - the relatively new technology that allows us to simply wave our credit cards over a scanner to pay for goods. According to the team behind the purse - entrepreneur Kevin and his sister Lindsay, based in San Diago, California - the clutch contains a 'special material' embedded into the design to help block these pesky RFID signals. 'Criminals with very minimal technical skills have created devices similar to the scanner which vendors such as grocery stores use,' the website description reads. It comes in a range of colors and can also be worn over the shoulder thanks to the chain strap. According to the United States Federal Trade Commission, identity theft had been holding steady for the last few years, having seen an increase of 21 per cent in 2008.","Criminals use RFID and NFC wireless communication to steal numbers .

"Having a chart topping app in the Apple Store is the holy-grail for every tech-developer. Topping the rankings means the app is on display to millions of people around the world who browse the store, making it an enormously lucrative and sought after feat. But an image which has gone viral this week suggests some designers are willing to stretch the rules in order to climb the charts, reports Shanghaiist. The photo shows a Chinese employee sitting in front of about 100 iPhones and apparently manipulating app store rankings . The photo, uploaded to social media site Weibo, shows a Chinese employee sitting in front of about 100 iPhones with the accompanying caption: 'Hardworking App Store ranking manipulation employee'. In theory, workers can  download the app to boost its ranking, delete it, and then download the app a second time for the same result. Numerous tech websites have featured the image, including Tencent Technology, who reported the image offers a glance into the elusive app-ranking manipulation industry. Tencent estimated that a hundred forged ratings can be created within an hour or two, though it's unclear how much of an influence this has on the App Store rankings. A second image purports to show the costs for breaking into the charts and keeping apps on given charts for a week .

"A sailor and his boyfriend have become the first ever male same-sex couple to share the ceremonial first kiss as they marked the homecoming of submarine warship USS San Francisco. Thomas Sawicki arrived at Naval Base Point Loma in San Diego, California on Monday to find his boyfriend Shawn Brier waiting to greet him as he returned to his home port. The men, who had been chosen to share the first kiss, were photographed in their embrace. 'Everyone was cheering for me when they announced it over email,' Sawicki told NBC San Diego. 'Everyone was very excited, very supportive, very happy.' Scroll down for video .

Back together: The couple said that their family and friends had been so excited when they were chosen . The seven month stint in the Western Pacific had been Sawicki's first deployment, and when he returned, Brier didn't want eyes to be on them for the wrong reasons. 'I don't want to screw it up and fall in the water or something,' Brier told NBC before the kiss. But he managed to stay on the dock and excitedly welcomed his partner back to the shore, as other families lined the port to welcome back their husbands, sons, fathers and brothers. The USS San Francisco is the second oldest warship submarine in its fleet and in a few years it will be re-purposed as a training platform for newly recruited nuclear officers, NBC reported. In 2005, the warship smashed into an underwater fountain, killing a sailor and injuring 97 sailors - and costing $134 million to repair it.

"Jeb Bush has hired Ethan Czahor as his campaign's chief technology officer . Shortly after it emerged that Jeb Bush had hired Ethan Czahor as his campaign's chief technology officer, the Hipster.com co-founder set out to do some spring cleaning on his Twitter. But it was already too late to discreetly delete a handful of 'jokes' the Santa Monica product manager had made where he calls out 'sl**s' and frets about gay guys at the gym. Buzzfeed reports that after it was reported the former Florida governor had hired Czahor to work for his political action committee, Right to Rise, dozens of tweets disappeared from Czahor's timeline. 'New study confirms old belief: college female art majors are sl**s, science majors are also sl**s but uglier,' one deleted tweet read, with an expired link. Other deleted tweets include a couple gay panic jokes Czahor made about working out at the gym. 'when i burp in the gym i feel like it's my way of saying, ""sorry guys, but i'm not gay,""' another said. The Bush camp told Czahor to delete the tweets  around the time his hire was announced, according to a spokesperson. Chief Comedy Officer: A handful of tweets riffing on sexist and homophobic themes disappeared from Ethan Czahor's feed after it was announced he was joining Jeb Bush's presidential campaign . Brogrammer: One of the more popular tweets Czahor kept was about branding a probiotics for men as 'brobiotics' 'Governor Bush believes the comments were inappropriate,' the spokesperson told BuzzFeed. 'They have been deleted at our request. Ethan is a great talent in the tech world and we are very excited to have him on board the Right to Rise PAC.' Czahor, part of the GOP's bid to raise the party's tech-savvy, developed the site jebspeech.com ahead of Bush's speech to the Detroit Economic Club on Wednesday. Time reports a message was found in the website's code soliciting resumes for Right to Rise, because nothing says cool like leaving secret messages for Time to discover. Old beliefs: Czahor calls college women sl**s in one deleted tweet that accompanies a now expired shortened link . Inappropriate: Bush reportedly believed the jokes were 'inappropriate,' though the spokesperson called Czahor a 'great talent' Gym ettiquete: At least two tweets referenced gay people working out in the gym with Czahor . Not gay: This tweet disappeared along with dozens of others on the request of former Governor Jeb Bush, a spokesperson confirmed . Czahor's Linkedin profile lists him as the chief technology officer at Hipster.com, a startup that went through several iterations during its short life. The now-deleted tweets were presumably up on Czahor's Twitter when AOL acquired Hipster.com in 2012 - and promptly killed it a month later. TechCrunch notes that during Czahor's time as CTO, Hipster.com was criticized because the app uploaded a 'big chunk' of contacts off a users' iPhone and onto the company's servers. Inappropriate: Bush reportedly believed the jokes were 'inappropriate,' though the spokesperson called Czahor a 'great talent' Now deleted: Apart from sexist passes at jokes, Czahor deleted duds about drunk driving signs and disaster relief . Gone: This tweet was dumped, though tweets like 'the super bowl is indeed super, but i find nothing worldly about the world series' live on in Czahor's timeline . Before Bush, Czahor served as CTO at Ready to Win, a for-profit launched by former J Crew CEO Dick Boyce aimed at strengthening Republican technological properties ahead of 2016. Boyce, who has tried to close the tech gap between Republicans and Democrats, also founded Liberty Works, which closed shop in June 2013 about a month after it was announced the GOP would use it to build its data platform, Huffington Post reported. After the Buzzfeed story, Czahor tried to tweet an explanation for his recent deletion spree, saying 'i deleted some old jokes i made years ago i no longer find funny or appropriate #learning #maturing.'","Ethan Czahor, the co-founder and chief technology officer of Hipster.com, deleted dozens of tweets, including several about gay men at the gym .

"A Kansas couple who have lived a 'wonderful life' together through eight decades of marriage won a competition for the longest-running married couple in the United States. The couple's secret to their 81-year-long run, at least according to Alice Rockey, is that at the end of the day 'I always let him have my way.' Alice and her husband Dale, both 99, say their romance began by chance one evening. They had planned to go on a double date, but each with another person. Never parted: Dale and Alice Rockey, both 99, have weathered 81 years together and won a competition for longest-running marriage Saturday . Dale pulled up to Alice's house early, while his date was still at work, and found her sitting along on the porch, the Kansas City Star reports. 'He came by and says, ""You want to go for a ride?""' Alice told the paper. 'So we went for a ride, and that was our first date.' The two were later 'in the doghouse' with their original dates, but they didn't regret the decision to get an early start on things. Alice married Dale, 'one of the handsomest guys in town,' in Nebraska, paying $2 for a marriage license on December 29, 1933. The pair skipped off to Hot Springs, South Dakota, before making their home in a two-room apartment. Dale worked in a garage that once belonged to his dad while Alice had a job with Iron Man early into the bodybuilding magazine's circulation, and eventually added five sons to the family. Chance encounter: The couple had their first date on an evening when they planned to go out with other people, but Dale arrived early and took Alice for a drive . Young couple: The Rockeys paid $2 for their marriage license back in 1933 and honeymooned in Hot Springs, South Dakota . Secret to success: The Rockey's five sons are still marriage to their spouses, even as they reach their seventies, and credit their parents' influence . Back together: The couple moved into a two-room apartment in Kansas near one of their sons, where they live a 'fancy-free' life . The husband and wife from Olathe, Nebraska, beat out 375 other lovebirds to be awarded the prize as the longest-married couple in the United States. Worldwide Marriage Encounter presented the Rockeys with the award at a ceremony Saturday, capping off the 2015 Longest Married Couple Project. Their children may one day have a chance at the prize themselves, as their children are still together with their spouses as well. 'That’s probably the good example set by our parents,' said 79-year-old son Tom Rockey. The couple retired in 1979 and traveled to 'all the southern states,' as their family added grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Now there are even great-great-grandchildren. The two later moved to Olathe, an into Tom's house, when household chores like mowing the lawn became too difficult. They now share another cozy two-room apartment. Alice said they spent their days in a 'fancy-free' way, going out for breakfast, working on crossword puzzles and waxing nostalgic. Dick and Diane Baumbach, of the faith-based marriage-enrichment organization Worldwide Marriage Encounter, say the project only amazes outsiders. 'When we meet with these people and honor them,' explains Dick Baumbach, 'they look at us like, ""What’s the big deal?""'","Alice and Dale Rockey of Olathe, Kansas, both 99, had their first date on an evening they had planned to go out with two separate people .

"These terrible estate agent photographs showing homes with wild colour schemes, oddly place furniture and even random animals might make you question how the owner ever made a sale. The genuine online adverts feature a house with a toilet in the utility cupboard and pictures with family pets and even residents in the frame. Andy Donaldson, from Aberdeen, stumbled across the awful pictures while looking for a new flat in London in 2013 and decided to set up a hilarious blog to show friends his discoveries. Peek-a-boo: This dog doesn't come with the house but wanted to make sure he was part of the picture as he popped up in this living room shot . Lounging about: This image has all the makings of a classic estate agent picture - except the resident has decided to take a seat for the shot . Unusual: This house has an interesting downstairs bathroom - it's in the utility cupboard with a precariously placed washing machine above it (left) while this man didn't even have time to wake up before the estate agents arrived to take the picture as he laid in bed (right) But the digital media manager’s Tumblr site went viral after it started to draw in 100,000 hits a day. Mr Donaldson said: ‘To begin with I spent a few hours a week searching for funny or bad images for the blog, but since it went viral I am now sent pictures from all over the world. ‘I get up to around 100 new images each week - and I have more than 2,000 great images saved for publication. ‘The photos I am sent come from websites all over the world - from the UK, US, Canada, across Europe, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan and even Khazakstan. A real pigsty: This peculiar room's main resident appears to be a huge pig, which rests its head on the sofa and lies across a rug while washing is suspended from the middle of the ceiling on an iron bar . Multi-purpose: The bathroom in this house doesn't have to be used for its main function - one can also enjoy sitting in a comfy armchair . Worried about the suns harsh penetrable rays? No worries, this kitchen has an outdoor garden table and chairs complete with a parasol . Caught short: This man appears to have been unable to hold it in as he demonstrated the use of the bedroom's en-suite bathroom (far right) ‘The intention of the blog is not to ridicule individual agents or agencies - it is a difficult job, and everyone makes mistakes sometimes. ‘But if an agent wants to complain about their photograph being used on my website, they would have to admit that it was their photograph, and I think the estate agents prefer to remain anonymous.’ Some of the pictures include an outdoor picnic table with parasol in the kitchen, a house with four front doors and even one occupant sleeping in bed. Oops: The kitchen fitters probably hadn't planned ahead with this one and barricaded the door in with counters (left) while this home has a strange looking hair piece on the table . Ways to confuse a burglar: This house comes with four front doors so the new owner will have to make sure they have a big enough key chain . The owners of this house decided to demonstrate that a couch can be a garden feature as well as household furniture in this terrible estate agent picture . Conspicuous: This probably wasn't the best place to hide a gun when estate agents are coming round to take pictures of your house . Freaky: This projector room is not for the faint-hearted as it's surrounded by creepy looking clowns and features in Andy Donaldson's book . The clowns are running theme in some of these terrible estate agent pictures - let's hope the new buyer doesn't suffer from coulrophobia (the fear of clowns) Scary: Another frightening room that featured on an estate agent advert was this one with a Victorian theme - and dolls in plastic cases . Others show a room with a pig sprawled on the floor as it rests its head on a sofa and another has an armchair and rug in the middle of a bathroom. He has now turned the photographs into a book called Terrible Estate Agent Photos and the UK version flew off the shelves over Christmas, completely selling out. The US version is set for release in April and Mr Donaldson is in the process of producing a 2016 calendar which will be available in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. At least you won't get cold feet: This bathroom comes carpeted with a boiler directly above the sink in and a slightly out of place toilet . Wonky: The photographer couldn't quite get the angle on this one as the showroom toilet has not been plumbed in and sits in the middle . This photographer has gone for the 'basement in an earthquake look' with a blurry shot that gives no perception of what the room is really like . Peculiar: This room once had a roaring fire but has since been replaced with a brand new central heating system... directly in its place . Great for the kids: This room has a huge mural painting to Thomas the Tank Engine, but looks slightly out of place with the grown-up bedding . 'This place comes with great views': One estate agent even had the audacity to take a picture out the window - a string of huge satellite dishes . Door for The Borrowers? The living room in this house has a slightly unusual entrance with only the top of the door visible from the skirting board . I predict a riot: It's not that easy to make out which room of the house this is - and the upturned furniture doesn't give much away either . Mysterious window: This house comes with large bay windows in the front room which are attractive to small children, according to this advert .

"A betting company has been inspired by the film release of erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey to produce a slightly disturbing advertisement. The ad 'stars' a greyhound playing the leading role of the raunchy movie's sadomasochistic billionaire Christian Grey, which they promise will leave you ‘hot under the collar’. In the advertisement, a demurely dressed journalist is shown to Mr Grey’s high-rise office - just like in the best-selling book - but when the camera pans to the desk, a greyhound in a tie sits with his pink tongue hanging out in the place of the handsome Mr Grey. What happens next is even more bizarre, as a dark haired woman seductively paints red lipstick on her lips and begins some kind of illicit encounter with the dog Tilly - who is actually a rescue dog. Scroll down for video . Sportsbet has created a bizarre Fifty Shades Of Grey parody starring a woman and a greyhound . The pooch sprawls out on a cushion-covered bed as the woman playing the role of Anastacia Steele scoops peanut butter from a jar, licks her lips and rolls around. But animal rights group Animal Liberation have slammed the advertisement, saying it is exploitative and demeaning to the greyhound. 'We completely oppose the whole notion of bestiality, which is clearly implied in ambiguous light in the clip,' a spokesman for Animal Liberation told Daily Mail Australia. 'It is a federal offence and penalties are severe. 'It is likely that exploitation would could have occurred in ‘training’ the dog to make the clip which is also not acceptable. 'Also, dressing the dog up demeans the animal,' the spokesman added. Fifty Shades of Greyhound has already been viewed over 200,000 times on Facebook . The parody video begins with a greyhound in a tie is sat with his pink tongue hanging out in the place of the handsome Christian Grey .

The woman is seen enjoying herself alongside Tilly the rescue dog . Later in the advert a dog’s paw is then seen opening the door to a red room of pain akin to the one in the novel but featuring doggy treats, chains and chews. ‘I want your chum,’ the woman shouts with her hands tied. The ad then cuts to a race track scene, with the woman wearing a white bunny costume. Tilly is released from the gates titled ‘the red box of pain’ and chases the woman to the sound of ‘who let the dogs out’. Seemingly catching up with, the pair is then shown between the sheets. ‘You sure went wacko,’ she says with ruffled hair . A dog’s paw is then seen opening the door to a red room of pain akin to the one in the novel . The room features doggy treats, chains and chews .

We promise it will leave you satisfied. ‘Sportsbet is giving doggy style a whole new meaning in a production that will leave you hot under the collar.’ Sportsbet’s YouTube channel highlights how Tilly the greyhound was adopted from the Greyhound Adoption Program.

"An Oklahoma police department wants drug users to know 'the dope man' is done dealing in their town. Officers from the Warr Acres Police Department posted a note on the front door of the home of suspected drug peddler Aaron Phelps after they arrested him. The message read: 'The Dope Man is Out Of Business. 'If you have any questions contact Warr Acres Police 789-3329.' Scroll down for video . The Warr Acres Police Department posted this note at the home of a suspected drug dealer in Oklahoma . Officers arrested alleged drug dealer Aaron Phelps (pictured) and posted the sign when he was in custody . The WAPD hit Phelps, 19, with a number of charges and he is being held in the Oklahoma County Jail . The department was hoping to serve notice that drug use would not be tolerated in Warr Acres. According to neighbors, there were people coming and going from the 19-year-old's home 'at all hours of the day and night' and there was even a 'waiting line' outside the door at times. A search of the house turned up drug paraphernalia, a digital scale, a hand-drawn picture that said 'WEED,' and substances believed to be drugs, News 9 reported. The search also revealed sandwich bags labeled 'OG Green' and 'Crack'. Oklahoma County records show Phelps was charged with distributing a controlled dangerous substance, maintaining a place where a controlled dangerous substance was kept, possession of an offensive weapon while committing a felony and possession of drug paraphernalia, last month. The department was hoping the sign would serve notice that drug use would not be tolerated in Warr Acres . After the police department posted the sign on Twitter, people began commenting how funny it was . One of Phelps' neighbors said the sign was 'kind of bad' but also 'hilarious,' KFOR reported. He wasn't the only one who found it funny. After the department posted a photo of the sign on Twitter - only the WAPD's third tweet ever - social media users began sharing and commenting about it. They tagged the post with: 'WAPD Criminal Investigations Unit shutting down another dope house in Warr Acres! #whosenext #wewontstop.' The Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office re-posted the image on Facebook. The sheriff's office then posted a picture of its own and incorporated some Valentine's Day humor. The Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office re-posted the sign on Facebook and followed it up with another image that attempted to incorporate some Valentine's Day humor (pictured) The tweet the WAPD sent out with the image of the sign was only the third time the department had tweeted . Warr Acres Sergeant John Gray said that although some found the sign funny, the department 'didn't mean it as a joke' and takes the situation very seriously. He said: 'We wanted the citizens to know that we're doing everything we can to make their neighborhood safer for them and for their children. 'If we have information that there's narcotics activity within our city limits, we will do everything we can to shut them down.' Phelps is being held in the Oklahoma County Jail on a $15,500 dollar bond, according to reports.","Officers from Warr Acres Police Department in Oklahoma posted the note .

"It is known as the happiest country in the world. And now Bhutan has released some spectacular images showing everyday life in the remote kingdom, including a snap of young Buddhist monks taken by the king himself. The stunning photos offer a glimpse of Bhutan that many will never see - a country where success is measured by happiness instead of GDP - and its gross national happiness (GNH) takes precedent over material wealth and riches. Scroll down for video . Young Buddhist monks gather in front of the King's Palace in the capital city, Thimpu, in this photo, taken by His Majesty the King of Bhutan . It is an unusual idea, first proposed by the former king Jigme Singye Wangchuck in 1972, around the time this remote kingdom high in the Himalayas tentatively opened its doors to tourism. Since then, the country has gained almost mythical status as an under-the-radar Shangri-La, where western visitors can explore a different way of life. The country has always drawn curious travellers thanks to its majestic untouched Himalayan scenery. But this week, it's expecting an unprecedented influx of visitors, as it holds its first ever International Festival, a 10-day celebration of arts and culture, starting on February 14. To coincide with the 5th King’s  35th birthday celebration and Losar, the Buddhist New Year, the festival will see eighty artists and performers, including Indian pop star, Lucky Ali and Mercury nominated UK indie folk artist, Nick Mulvey collaborating with the best from Bhutan. Ahead of the spectacular festival, Bhutan has released the set of images offering a glimpse into life in 'the happiest country in the world' including one taken by King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, showing young Buddhist monks against the spectacular backdrop of the King's Palace. Tibetan prayer flags overlooking Himalayan Mountains. In Bhutan, prayer flags are hoisted for happiness, long life, prosperity, luck and to offer karmic merit to all sentient beings. When someone dies, prayer flags are believed to guide the soul of the dead away from the netherworld . During the festivities, traditional masked  dancers will perform alongside contemporary acts from around the world, and visitors can attend talks on the latest theories about happiness. Flights to Bhutan cost around £900 return from UK/Europe, or $1500 from the USA. For more travel and visa information see http://bhif.org/travel-information/BHIF . The event also comprises the Bhutan International Marathon and immersive traditional cooking demonstrations from the country's best chefs. Until recently, Bhutan has been isolated due to geographical location, allowing it to retain its unique culture and heritage. Bhutan is known for its natural scenic and cultural highlights and its welcoming people. It was the first country in the world to write environmental protection into its constitution, with a mandate for 60 per cent of country to be covered by forest. Virginia Galloway, Festival Co-Director tells Mail Online Travel: 'The aim is to position Bhutan International Festival as a unique, must-attend, world class festival that serves not only the artistic community but has a positive ripple effect on the local economy. The pink lotus is  generally reserved for the highest deity, sometimes confused with the white lotus it is the lotus of the historical Buddha . 'The concept is to bring together various artistic disciplines with an emphasis on collaboration, which will hopefully inspire new works of art and new ways of working.' 'Most festivals in Bhutan and around the globe are about highlighting the works of individual artists. 'We decided to take a different approach by not only highlighting individuals, but also encouraging and fostering artistic collaborations between participating artists.'

"They are less likely to be adopted than dogs of other colors. So, one Utah-based photographer decided to help dark-colored pups in need of a home - by taking striking portraits of them. Guinnevere Shuster rounded up eight black dogs at the Humane Society of Utah, including two old Labradors who had had no adoptive interest at all. She then fixed a flowery crown or necklace to each of the canines, before photographing them against a dark backdrop to 'highlight their eyes'. And the result is simply striking. Many of the animals look majestic, like kings of the canine world, while others are gazing at the camera adorably. Beautiful: Utah-based photographer Guinnevere Shuster decided to help eight dark-colored pups in need of a home - by taking striking portraits of them.

Indeed, the images are so moving they have helped six of the dogs find owners since the end of January, including the two 10-year-old Labradors. Speaking of her pictures, Ms Shuster told The Huffington Post: 'People often comment on how black dogs do not photograph well, so I really wanted to show that they can,' She added: 'I would have expected two, maybe three, to have been adopted [in the past few weeks] without the photos.' Ms Shuster said her method for creating the first series of images (she has since photographed more dark-colored dogs) was 'really easy and cheap'. First, she spent $22 on faux flowers. Then, she hot-glued them into paper crowns and necklaces that she had bought at a Dollar Store, she said. 'Oh, I did raid one dried flower arrangement for the two lotus flowers and dried wheat grass,' Ms Shuster added. Finally, the photographer placed the crowns and necklaces on the dogs at the shelter, before snapping photos of them in front of the black backdrop.

Following her images' success, a number of other canine shelters and rescue groups in the area have inquired as to how they can highlight their black dogs' best features in a bid to enhance their chances of being adopted. And Ms Shuster hopes more groups nationwide will strive to do the same. 'When people see this series I hope they see how beautiful black shelter dogs are,' said the photographer.

"Jesse Matthew has been charged with the first-degree murder of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham but will not face the death penalty. Matthew, 33, already had been charged last year with the 18-year-old's abduction after she went missing on leaving a bar in Charlottesville, Virginia at 2am on September 13. A month later, Miss Graham's remains were found in a shallow grave behind a rural property, eight miles from where she vanished. Her death was declared a homicide in November. Albemarle County prosecutor Denise Lunsford announced that Matthew was indicted on a first-degree murder charge at a short press conference on Tuesday but would not give any details on the evidence. Scroll down for video . Jesse Matthew, 33, (pictured right) was charged today with the first-degree murder of 18-year-old Hannah Graham (left) who went missing in Charlottesville, Virginia last September . She would not go into details as to why Matthew would not face a capital murder charge which carries the death penalty. The 33-year-old is also charged with abduction with intent to defile and two incidents of reckless driving. Ms Lunsford said that it had been an 'incredibly difficult process' for the Graham family and investigators. The prosecutor said she had spoken to the Graham family on multiple occasions and that they were aware of the charges being brought against their daughter's alleged killer. Ms Lunsford also said that the family of another murdered student, Morgan Harrington, had been made aware of the charges brought against Matthew. There were no pending charges against Matthew with regards to Miss Harrington's death at this time. DNA evidence has  linked Matthew to Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student, who vanished after attending a concert in Charlottesville in October 2009. Her body was found a few months later, hidden at a remote farm. Matthew's first court appearance has been scheduled for February 18 at 11am in Albemarle County Court. He is not expected to appear in person but via video link. Chief of police, Colonel Steve Sellers, thanked the public for their help in searching for missing sophomore Miss Graham. Albemarle County prosecutor Denise Lunsford (right) announced Matthews was being charged with first-degree murder but would not reveal details of evidence. Chief of police, Colonel Steve Sellers (left) thanked the public for their help in searching for UVA student Hannah Graham . The teenager's remains were left close to Matthew's mother former home in Albemarle County. Matthew grew up in the area and is familiar with the surroundings. Before Miss Graham disappeared, she texted a friend at 1am to tell them that she was lost. DNA has linked Matthew to the disappearance and death of UVA student Morgan Harrington in 2009, who vanished after attending a gig in Charlottesville . She was last seen on surveillance footage from a downtown mall in Charlottesville. Matthew was also seen on this footage. On September 24, Matthew was charged with abduction with intent to defile after being picked up by police in Galveston, Texas, around 1,300 miles away. He was extradited to Virginia to face charges. Matthew is now suspected in a string of unsolved deaths, disappearances and sexual assaults across Virginia over the last decade. Samantha Ann Clarke, 19, disappeared from Orange County, Virginia in September 2010. DaShad Laquinn Smith, also 19, disappeared on West Main Street in Charlottesville in November 2012. As Matthew emerged as the main suspect in Miss Graham's disappearance, it was revealed that he had been accused of sexual assault multiple times in the past 12 years. A sexual assault allegation was made against him at Liberty University in Virginia on October 17, 2002, when a woman accused him of raping her on campus. The allegation was investigated by Lynchburg Police and turned over to the prosecutor's office - but the woman declined to press charges and no witnesses could be found, so the case was dropped. He dropped out of Liberty University on the day the allegation was made. Matthew then attended Christopher Newport University in Virginia where he was accused of another sexual assault on September 7, 2003. Matthew has been linked to a string of young women's deaths, disappearances and sexual assaults across Virginia over the last ten years . Matthew's name has now been connected to the disappearances of DaShad Laquinn Smith, 19 (right), in November 2012 and Samantha Ann Clarke, 19 (left)  in September 2010. Both young women vanished in the Charlottesville area . Five days after the alleged incident, Matthew quit the school's football team and a month after, he left the school. It is not clear how the second incident was resolved. Matthew is also charged in the sexual assault of a 26-year-old woman in Fairfax, Virginia, in 2005. Mathew has pleaded not guilty to attempted capital murder, rape and sexual assault in that case. In January, DNA testing cleared Matthew of involvement in the abduction and murder of Alexis Murphy, the 17-year-old Virginia girl who went missing in 2013 and has never been found. Following Mathew's arrest in October, the attorney for Randy Allen Taylor - the man convicted of Miss Murphy's murder - requested that Matthew be properly examined as a possible suspect in the teen's death. Graham was last seen with Matthew at a downtown bar in Charlottesville, Virginia. Her body was found a month later eight miles away behind a rural property .","Jesse Matthew, 33, was indicted for first-degree murder and the abduction of 18-year-old Hannah Graham .

"An Australian family says a government-appointed panel's decision could determine whether one of them lives of dies. Shane Raisher, 32, from Frankston, Victoria is paying $10,500 every three weeks for a 'magic' drug that could keep him alive to see his two-year-old boy Jett and unborn baby grow up. The 'wonder drug' MK-3475 has worked miracles in fending off Mr Raisher's aggressive melanoma, which he has fought since getting a mole tested when he was 18. But the Raisher family said they are 'going broke' and are only able to afford the drug because of community donations. They are pleading with the independent Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Council to list the drug on the Pharmaceutical Benefits scheme, which would make it radically more affordable. Shane Raisher, pictured with his two-and-a-half year old son Jett, suffers from an aggressive form of melanoma . Young family: Jett Raisher 'always asks, ""Daddy, are you better? Daddy are you better?"" Mr Raisher's condition has improved when he has taken MK-3475, with his tumours reducing in size . 'Please don't let me die of melanoma waiting for this cancer drug to be approved,' Shane writes in a Change.org petition. Shane's occasional use of the drug has dramatically improved his quality of life, allowing him to go to work and feel much more energetic. According to Ms Raisher, Shane's love for his young son Jett which is powering him through a difficult time in his life. 'Jett is definitely Shane's motivation - if he's got anything to fight, he's got Jett,' she told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday. 'It's very daunting for him to see his dad in hospital. He's a very caring little boy. 'He always asks ""Daddy, are you better? Daddy are you better? 'It's hard, it's hard on everyone.'

Loving family: Shane and Danielle are hoping the drug will be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme . The community has rallied behind the family in the past two years, raising more than $85,000 to cover the costs of the tumour-reducing drug for the struggling young family. Jett's childcare centre even raised $5,000 for the family. The advisory council considers the safety, clinical effectiveness and value for money in judging PBS submissions. 'We're praying as hard as we can,' Ms Raisher told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday. 'If the government doesn't approve it - I just think they'd be crazy not to approve it. 'You'd be saving so many people's lives.' PBAC will publish its decision in April.","Shane Reischer, 32, suffers an aggressive form of melanoma .

"A rookie NYPD officer has been indicted by a grand jury on manslaughter charges for the fatal shooting of an unarmed father while patrolling a darkened stairwell of a housing project last November, said the dead man's lawyer on Tuesday. Officer Peter Liang, 28, opened fire without warning on November 20 when Akai Gurley, 28, opened the door to the stairs with his girlfriend because he had become impatient waiting for the elevator. According to reports it took Liang and his partner more than six minutes to call for respond to their radio after the officer fired a single bullet and killed the father-of-one. Liang will surrender himself and appear in court on Wednesday according to Scott Rynecki, an attorney representing Gurley's family. Surrendered: Peter Liang arrives at the 84th precinct today in New York to be arrested and charged with the manslaughter of Akai Gurley . Justice: Unarmed father-of-one, Akai Gurley (pictured) was shot dead by NYPD Officer Peter Liang in November. His death was one of a series of deaths involving black men at the hands of police which sparked angry protests across the United States last year . The charges against Liang, in the death of the father-of-one weren't immediately made clear but sources have indicated that he will be charged with manslaughter in the second degree. Patrick J. Lynch, head of Liang's union, said he deserves due process. 'The fact that he was assigned to patrol one of the most dangerous housing projects in New York City must be considered among the circumstances of this tragic accident,' Lynch said. The indictment comes after mass protests and calls for reform of the grand jury system nationwide following a Staten Island grand jury's refusal to indict a police officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner and a Missouri grand jury's decision not to indict an officer in the death of Michael Brown. The November death of Gurley, 28, was ruled a 'homicide' by the Medical Examiner's office - just as Eric Garner's was. Rynecki said the shooting was unjustified, regardless of whether it was intentional. 'This is the first step for justice,' he said. Scene: A stairwell is seen at a building in a public housing project in Brooklyn known as the 'Pink Houses', where Akai Gurley was killed by rookie NYPD Officer Peter Liang . Devastating loss: Akai Gurley's daughter Akaila sits on her mother Kimberly Ballinger's lap as reverend Al Sharpton speaks at the National Action Network in Harlem in the days after her father's death . Asian-American Liang and his partner were patrolling the Louis Pink Houses, a public housing development in Brooklyn's gritty East New York neighborhood, on November 20. The New York Police Department assigns rookie officers as reinforcements in parts of the city that have seen increases in crime. The housing project, where Gurley's friend lives, had been the scene of a recent shooting, robberies and assaults. The officers had descended onto an eighth-floor landing when, 14 steps away, Gurley and the woman who had been braiding his hair opened a door into the seventh-floor landing after giving up their wait for the elevator so he could head to the lobby. The lights were burned out in the stairwell, leaving it 'pitch black' and prompting both officers to use flashlights, police said after the shooting. Liang, for reasons unclear, also had his gun drawn, police said. He was about 10 feet from Gurley when, without a word and apparently by accident, he fired a shot, police said. Gurley was struck in the chest. The two made it down two flights of stairs after he was shot, but he collapsed on the fifth-floor landing and lost consciousness, according to the woman, Melissa Butler. Protesters demanding justice for Akai Gurley, holds a placard at the site of his shooting death in Brooklyn on December 27 last year . Gurley was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died, police said. After Liang discharged the bullet, he and partner Shaun Landau did not respond to radio contact for more than 6.5 minutes, the New York Daily News reported in December. New York police almost immediately declared that his death was a 'very unfortunate tragedy' and commissioner Bill Bratton described Gurley as a 'total innocent.' Police officials pieced together the details of the shooting from radio reports and interviews with the girlfriend and the second officer, but they have not spoken to Liang and won't until after the criminal proceedings are completed. Liang was placed on desk duty after the shooting. The shooting came at a time when the NYPD, the nation's biggest police department, is changing how rookie officers are used fresh out of the academy to give them more training and time with more senior officers. The shooting recalled a 2004 incident in which 19-year-old Timothy Stansbury was shot dead by a startled officer on a Brooklyn rooftop of a housing complex. His family got a $2 million settlement with the city.","A grand jury has indicted Officer Peter Liang over the death of  unarmed Akai Gurley .

"Flipped vertically on its nose between a house and a stone wall, the driver of this vehicle had to be cut free by firefighters after finding himself in a tight spot when his car left the road. The miraculous escape in Buckfastleigh, Devon, occurred when the driver lost control and skidded into the narrow gap, requiring firefighters to cut him carefully out of the vehicle. Pictures of the rescue show firefighters from the local fire station grappling inside the up-ended car in a bid to free him from the front seat. A firefighter attempts to rescue the driver from inside the vehicle after it became stuck in the narrow space . Fire crews cut part of the car door and used a step ladder in order to create a platform for the rescue . The driver of the vehicle was freed and then taken to hospital via ambulance. Firefighters later said his seat belt saved him from serious injury . A spokesman for Buckfastleigh fire station said: 'On arrival the crews confirmed that a private vehicle had left the highway, a male casualty was still inside the vehicle and being tended to by paramedics and members of the HART Team. 'Our first priority was to secure the vehicle and eliminate the danger of the vehicle falling onto its side. 'Due to the location of the incident and position of the vehicle, access was hampered and as a result crews cut the check strap and the top of the door with the hydraulic cutters to create some space. 'The door, along with the use of a short extension ladder, T-bar and line was used to make a platform to allow better access. The driver of the vehicle was later taken to hospital. The spokesman added that it was only because the driver was wearing a seat belt that he was not seriously injured.","Driver left stuck inside car after crashing into gap between house and wall .

"It's a cold and windy Tuesday in February  and I'm on my way to Cheshire, looking - in my head - pretty glamorous. And by glamorous, I mean that I have woken up half an hour earlier than I normally would, blow-dried, brushed AND straightened my hair and I have a full face of make-up on. All before 9am. Or at least I thought it was a full face of make up-until I arrived at Opium in Hale Barns, the salon owned by Ampika Pickston from the hit reality TV series, The Real Housewives of Cheshire. Scroll down for video . Before and after: When FEMAIL writer Olivia Foster arrived at Real Housewives Of Cheshire star Ampika Pickston's beauty salon Opium in Hale Barns for a makeover (left) she already thought she was  wearing a lot of make-up, until they put even more on her (right) The dream team: Ampika (centre) poses with her salon's beauticians Stacey Bolland (left) and Angela Ferguson (right) The salon is full of silver, chandeliers and incredibly good-looking, very groomed people. In fact, the pretty beauticians, who are busying themselves applying polish at the nail station, look better than I do on most nights out and I wonder if I have time to sneak into the toilet and shove on another layer of lipstick. I'm here to find out what it takes to look like the nation's new favourite reality stars - the glamorous women of Cheshire. The breakout star of the show is Ampika, the tanned, big-haired straight-talking businesswoman who's also the only divorcee of the programme. When I meet her in the flesh - all hair, legs and a pearly white smile to boot- she doesn't disappoint and it takes no time at all to feel like I'm in an episode of the ITV2 show. 'Just wait til we're done with you,' she beams, leading me in to a treatment room complete with faux fur blanket  and offering me a glass of Champagne, which I politely decline as it's only 11.45 in the morning. Facial time: Stacey cleansed Olivia's skin and removed her make-up before she started the procedure . The first step in my Real Housewives makeover is a  CACI facial, which involves being prodded with what look like cattle prongs. Thankfully, they don't feel like them though and the beautician Stacey Bolland explains that the probes, which feel like a firm massage, are lifting and re-shaping my face. I'm pretty sceptical that it's doing anything at all but when the right side is finished she hands me a mirror and I have to say the results are pretty impressive. The probes sent waves through Olivia's face which are supposed to lift and tighten her muscles . My face looks visibly lifted to the point that the left side now looks a little saggy in comparison, which, at 27, is not something you want to see. The treatment, which is known as a non-surgical facelift, concludes with LED light therapy which is supposed to iron out the lines on your forehead. I resist saying that until this makeover started, I didn't even think I had any. Next up is the Skinbreeze facial, which starts with an orbital microdermabrasion head that exfoliates the outer layer of your skin. Olivia, left, tries out the Real Housewives' beauty treatments while a fully made-up Ampika looks on . At the end of the Skinbreeze facial, Olivia's beautician Angela sprayed a relaxing mist over her face . This stings a bit but is soon cooled by a face mask. I ask Ampika how often she would recommend having the treatments done and she replies: 'If I could I would have one about every couple of weeks. 'It's important to maintain your skin. Our clients come in regularly and usually sign up for a course of ten treatments.' Sounds like this real housewife malarkey is a lot of hard work. Angela Ferguson, who does the treatment, explains that the results are supposed to be like having the Botox without having to pump your face full of chemicals. Ampika and Olivia have their nails done, Real Housewives style - with a glass of Champagne . Ampika helped  Olivia to pick a light, classic colour that wouldn't clash with her dress . A second reveal shows my face is smooth and incredibly clean-looking and it does look tighter - there's something to this  'notox,' thing after all. The only downside is that with the top layer of my skin removed, the emergency fake tan I had applied the night before is clear to see in a ring around my neck. But it's a small price to pay for crystal clear skin and they assure me this can be covered with make-up later on. Next up came the task of picking a nail varnish to match my Karen Millen makeover dress - fresh from Ampika's own wardrobe with the tags still on. 'I think you should go with a light colour, something classic,' says Ampika, who has owned the salon in the the leafy Cheshire suburb for the last year. Time for a wash: Kirsty washed Olivia's hair before getting to work on drying it and putting it into an extravagant up-do . Liz gave Olivia a similar look to Ampika's, recreating the Cheshire businesswoman's favourite smoky eye . Make-up complete: When the make-up was done you could no longer tell Olivia had a fake-tan error . As I settle down at the nail bar, she brings me a glass of fizz and I begin to think I could get used to this Real Housewives lifestyle. On the ITV2 show, Ampika and her fellow housewives Dawn Ward, Lauren Simon, Tanya Bardsley, Leanne Brown and Magali Gorre certainly do appear to live the high life. The women fill their weeks with Champagne brunches, charity galas and plenty of gossip. But there are some downsides, or at least 'odd' sides to starring in a successful television show. During my time at the salon, Ampika is bombarded with phone calls from a man pretending to be her ex-husband, Mark. While it seems he's just a harmless fan, it must be a bit disconcerting for her and her staff. From London girl to Cheshire housewife: Olivia is given Ampika's  make-up and now her dress . I ask her if it's been odd adjusting to life on the small screen. She says: 'It is very surreal, but mostly people are nice and I've had a lot of support.' On the show, Ampika comes across as the tough one of the group but in real life she definitely has a softer side. She also has a strong work ethic that doesn't come across on the programme - she's very hands-on with the salon where she works seven days a week. After my nails are finished, we head upstairs and she lends me her own make-up artist, Liz Clough, to begin the final steps of my transformation. 'I always like to have a glamorous eye,' she advises, so I opt for the same. Great host: Ampika made sure to make her new lookalike Olivia feel welcome at her Opium salon . At the front desk: Ampika works in the salon seven days a week and is very hands-on with the business . It feels strange to be wearing so much make-up in the middle of the day but I must say the results are amazing. My skin looks flawless and I have contouring that even Kim Kardashian would be envious of. With my make-over nearly complete, Opium's hair-stylist Kirsty Dickson teases my hair into a giant bouffant do and it's time to slip on my dress. Ampika too slips into a new outfit - a breast-baring, leg-showing, showstopper of a gown that wouldn't put her out of place on Strictly Come Dancing. As she's slipping into her costume, she says: 'When I'm in London I like to shop at Harrod's and Selfridges but I buy a lot of my clothes abroad as well as I hate to wear the same things as everyone else.' As the day draws to a close and I wave goodbye to Ampika and the other salon staff, I can't help but feel a little sad to be leaving Cheshire. I'd certainly like to keep my Real Housewives look, if only I had my own hair-stylist and make-up artist...","Olivia Foster, 27, traveled to Cheshire for a Real Housewives makeover .

"Hollywood stars, music legends and prominent businessmen were yesterday revealed to have held secret Swiss accounts with HSBC – as the bank was accused of helping the super-rich to avoid paying taxes. Leaked bank files showed a virtual celebrity Who’s Who of thousands of wealthy customers who held secret accounts, including singers David Bowie, Tina Turner and Phil Collins and actress Joan Collins. The files led to accusations that HSBC’s private banking arm had aggressively marketed Swiss accounts to its wealthiest customers, allowing some to hide millions of pounds in undeclared ‘black’ accounts and avoid paying taxes in their home countries. Scroll down for video . Leak: Details of thousands of HSBC customers have been released, including Elle Macpherson (right), whose lawyers said she 'has accounted for UK tax on the basis of full disclosure in accordance with UK law’. David Bowie (left with wife Iman), who was also named, said he banked in Switzerland because he lived there . Details: Account details leaked from with HSBC's Swiss banking arm named Joan Collins and Christian Slater . The bank records – containing details of more than 100,000 customers worldwide, including 8,844 in Britain – were stolen in 2007 by Herve Falciani, a computer expert working for the bank in Geneva. Falciani, 43, said he took them as a ‘whistle-blower’ because he knew tax evaders were using the bank. He fled to France and gave the files to authorities there. Last night’s Panorama programme on BBC1 said Britain’s biggest bank had helped some of its wealthy clients cheat the country out of millions of pounds in tax. It is not illegal to hold a Swiss bank account but it is against the law to use a secret account to hide assets to avoid paying tax. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the celebrities named as holding accounts. The revelations prompted a major political row yesterday after it emerged that the bank’s chairman at the time, Stephen Green, now Lord Green, was later appointed as a minister in David Cameron’s Government. Singers Bowie, Turner and Phil Collins and Formula One star Fernando Alonso said they banked in Switzerland because they lived there. There is no suggestion any of them were involved in illegal tax practices. Actress Joan Collins’s accountant said she co-operated fully with a 2011 HM Revenue & Customs check which found she did not owe any additional tax. Others named included Hollywood actor Christian Slater and footballer Diego Forlan. They did not respond to requests for comment. Scandal: HSBC's Swiss bank, pictured in Geneva, allowed its clients to withdraw bricks of cash, allowed clients to conceal undeclared 'black accounts' and gave accounts to criminals and corrupt businessmen . Lawyers for supermodel Elle Macpherson, another celebrity on the list, said: ‘Ms Macpherson is an Australian citizen who has accounted for UK tax on the basis of full disclosure in accordance with UK law.’ HSBC, which has its headquarters in London, said its Swiss arm was not fully integrated into HSBC after its purchase in 1999, allowing ‘significantly lower’ standards of compliance and due diligence. It said it had taken ‘significant steps’ to tighten security and introduce reforms. In a day of dramatic developments: . HSBC admitted that some account holders had taken advantage of bank secrecy rules to hold undeclared accounts, but said it had ‘fundamentally changed’ its systems. Customers were said to have withdrawn ‘bricks’ of cash from accounts in Switzerland, a tax haven, effectively allowing them to take the money into their home country without declaring it to tax authorities. Prince and Princess Michael of Kent (pictured together last year) were among those named as holding secretive Swiss accounts. The account was 'inactive' and they deny any money was ever held in the account . Officials at HMRC were given the leaked data in 2010 following an investigation in France and looked at about 1,000 cases, recouping £135 million in tax, interest and penalties. But the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, Labour MP Margaret Hodge, questioned the rigour of the HMRC investigation. She said: ‘I don’t think the tax authorities have been strong enough, assertive enough, tough enough.’ She also raised questions about Lord Green’s knowledge of the scandal, saying: ‘Either he didn’t know and he was asleep at the wheel, or he did know and then he was therefore involved in dodgy tax practices.’ Lord Green declined to comment, telling the Guardian: ‘As a matter of principle, I will not comment on the business of HSBC, past or present.’ Former tax inspector Richard Brooks told Panorama: ‘I think they [HSBC] were a tax avoidance and tax evasion service. I think that’s what they were offering. ‘They knew full well that people came to them to dodge their tax liabilities.’","Accounts show virtual celebrity Who's Who of wealthy customers .

"The oldest living crew member of the USS Arizona, the battleship which sunk in just nine minutes during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, resulting in the loss of 1,177 lives, has died aged 100. Retired Navy Lieutenant Commander Joseph Langdell was the ship's last surviving officers, before his death at a nursing home in Yuba City, Northern California, on February 4. Langdell was one of the few who was not killed when the Japanese attacked the Arizona on December 7, 1941, because, by a stroke of luck, he happened to be on shore at the time. Had he been onboard, the then 28-year-old would have  died, he later said. Scroll down for video . Navy Lt. Commander Joseph Langdell - seen here wearing his dress white uniform - has died aged 100. He was the oldest living crew member of the battleship USS Arizona to have survived Pearl Harbor . Langdell, who was 28 at the time, watched the USS Arizona sink in just nine minutes - taking 1,177 of his crew mates with it . Langdell was an ensign on an assignment which meant he was sleeping on a military base next to the ship in Honolulu, Hawaii, that morning. The young officer, who graduated from Boston University in 1938 before joining the Navy aged 26, was awoken by 'a strange noise' - the sounds of the Japanese bombing Pearl Harbour. He rushed outside, and watched his ship sink in just nine minutes. He would later tell the Appeal Democrat he was 'as close as you could get' to the bombing without being hit. 'I felt absolutely helpless as I watched the attack,' Langdell recalled on the 56th anniversary of the attack that drew the United States into World War II. 'If I had been aboard, I would have been killed in that No. 2 (gun) turret. That was the one that blew up. 'It was my luck to be assigned off the ship that day.' Only 335 people survived on the USS Arizona, and Langdell spent the following hours and days trying to rescue shipmates from the burning water, preparing for another possible air assault. In total, eight battleships were lost or damaged in the attack - including the Arizona - while 2,335 men died. The bombing led to the U.S.'s entry into World War Two. 'I saw some of my men wading ashore,' he said in 2009. 'We took them down to the naval hospital, and went back and got some more. Ten days later, he was tasked with leading the survivors to remove the dead bodies 'above the waterline'. It took them two days. It took Langdell and other survivors two days to clear the bodies from the Arizona. Pictured: The American destroyer USS Shaw explodes during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour . Langdell, left, seen here greeting Sgt. Carlos Ramirez at the Pearl Harbor Memorial in 2011, remained in the navy for another four years . The New Hampshire native spent another four years in the Navy - marrying his wife Libby in 1942 - before going to work as an auctioneer, a furniture manufacturer's representative and eventually the long-time owner of a Yuba City furniture store. The couple had three children - two boys and a girl. However, he kept quiet about his war experiences until they were older. Younger son Ted said his father  returned to Pearl Harbor for the first time since the war in 1976, when his older son was in the Navy. After that, Langdell took comfort in meeting with fellow survivors and pride in always wearing a USS Arizona hat - becoming a regular at the parades in his hometown. 'It drew attention not just to him, but gave him the chance to tell stories,' Ted said. 'Anyone in the service has stories to tell if you make the effort to listen and to really hear and try to understand what they are saying.' In 2001 - 50 years after the attack on the Arizona - Langdell would come face-to-face with one of the men who carried out the bombing. As part of a film remembering the Arizona, Langell accepted a floral wreath in memory of his crew mates from former Japanese Lt Commander Zenji Abe at a memorial to the ship. Abe - who is described in USS Arizona: The Life and Death of a Lady as having dropped one of the first bombs - says he prays the men are at peace. 'I appreciate your thoughtfulness,' Langdell responds. 'It took more courage on your part to present this wreath than it did for me to accept it.' Langdell's ashes will be put aboard the USS Arizona Memorial in Hawaii, mostly likely on December 7. The reunion association says there are now eight remaining survivors. Langdell - seen here standing in the Shrine Room of the USS Arizona Memorial in Pearl Harbor in 2008 - did not talk about his experiences in the attack until his children had grown up . He would later become an active member of the USS Arizona's survivors association, and was a regular at parades in his hometown.

"In the end, it took an Old West method for demolition workers to topple the final tower left standing after a Las Vegas casino implosion. The 13-hour saga came to a close after the building was lassoed with steel cables attached to a crane that then pulled and pulled until the elevator shaft of the Clarion hotel-casino came tumbling down. 'The building is finally down,' site owner Lorenzo Doumani announced late yesterday afternoon. More than 4,000 pounds of explosives were used to demolish the Clarion before sunrise Tuesday. Demolition workers toppled the final tower left standing in the Las Vegas Clarion hotel-casino implosion by using a 'lasso trick' with a crane that was reminiscent of the Old West . After the first explosion, the concrete block structure (pictured here after finally getting pulled down) had dropped four stories and was left standing at a height of 100 feet . The building was lassoed with steel cables attached to a crane that then pulled and pulled until the elevator shaft came tumbling down . Crews had to use cables and a crane because no wrecking balls were immediately available and the the remainder of the building, which was leaning, was considered a safety hazard . After the dust cleared, the concrete block structure had dropped four stories and was left standing at a height of 100 feet. There were no wrecking balls immediately available and the the remainder of the building, which was leaning, was considered a safety hazard. So crews went to their Plan B - cables and a crane, as seen on a video posted to YouTube. The 12-story Clarion casino-hotel, which opened its doors in 1970 and was briefly owned by actress Debbie Reynolds, became the 13th hotel to gain implosion infamy in Sin City. Ready to rumble: With the sound of slot machines blurring out the noise, more than 4,000 pounds of explosives were used to demolish a Las Vegas hotel early Tuesday . Steeped in history: The 200-room casino-hotel first opened as the Royal Inn and was called the Debbie Reynolds - for its one-time owner . Behind-the-scenes: The implosion required several months of planning and 4,400 pounds of explosives, said Anthony O. Schlecht, safety coordinator for Las Vegas-based Burke Construction . Dust everywhere: Preparation for the demolition extended to covering nearby pools, including at the neighboring Marriott hotel . Doumani, a developer who purchased the property in October for $22.5 million in cash, plans to build a 60-story hotel tower that could be the tallest occupied building on the Strip. There would be no condos or casino. 'Instead of trying to compete with everybody, you have to have something unique,' he said. And that uniqueness could involve catering to convention-goers, including incorporating untraditional office-space to appeal to companies that frequent Las Vegas for conventions. He said he hopes to have a plan in place by the end of the year and doesn't expect any kind of opening before 2018. Doumani said he'll be posting updates to 305CCD.com including video of Tuesday's implosion. He watched the demolition - which lasted around ten seconds - with his family. After listening to a pre-implosion soundtrack of Frank Sinatra the group, flanked by two showgirls, did a countdown to the Clarion's final seconds at nearly 3am, . The 200-room casino-hotel first opened as the Royal Inn and was called the Debbie Reynolds - for its one-time owner - as well as the Greek Isles and the Paddle Wheel. Bright future: Lorenzo Doumani, a developer who purchased the property in October for $22.5 million in cash, plans to build a 60-story hotel tower that could be the tallest occupied building on The Strip . Amanda Dickerson had never stayed at the Clarion or any of its incarnations, but she reveled in its demise early Tuesday morning after traveling from Ripon, Wisconsin, to check an unlikely item off her life's bucket list: witness a building implosion in person. 'We don't do this in Wisconsin,' she said after the dust had almost settled. 'It was truly amazing.' Dickerson, 35, her boyfriend Pete Kuhn, 38, and Las Vegas local Cherie DeWilde, who first alerted her friend to the impending implosion, had been scoping out the casino-hotel earlier Monday when they got to talking with the construction crew. After telling their tale, the trio earned an exclusive invite to watch the building crumble from across the street alongside the developer, his family, friends and members of the press. 'It was one of the best experiences of my life,' Dickerson said. Pointing to the leftover rubble, Kuhn joked that it resembled something else. 'That also looks like our wallet this week,' he said. What took seconds to destroy required several months of planning and 4,400 pounds of explosives, said Anthony O. Schlecht, safety coordinator for Las Vegas-based Burke Construction who said the preparation extended to covering nearby pools, including at the neighboring Marriott hotel. It's been a while since a casino-hotel was felled by controlled explosives. Between 2004 and 2007, six Vegas properties were brought down, but in the eight years since, the only Strip-side implosions were the segment of the Tropicana and a parking structure. Flashback: The casino-hotel (seen here in 2007) was also known as the Greek Isles and the Paddle Wheel during its time . The Clarion was no marquee property on the scale of a Stardust, which was imploded eight years ago, or a Dunes, which made way for the Bellagio. 'It's a little harder to gin up the same degree of interest,' said University of Nevada, Las Vegas history professor Michael Green of the Clarion's less noteworthy impending implosion. Doumani said he knows this isn't a landmark property. Perhaps appropriately, Doumani watched the implosion of the casino-hotel he bought last year from a parking lot that paved over the spot where the Landmark casino-hotel once stood, before it was demolished in 1995. Instead the Clarion, off the Strip across from the area's convention center, has had several names and had fallen into bankruptcy nearly as many times, he said. 'It is not a storied site,' he said. He said it was the building itself, and rooms that resembled cubicles, that didn't work, not the location. Its proximity both to the Strip and to the convention center appealed to Doumani. He will now work on financing the rebuild as he waits for nearby development to come to fruition.","Demolition workers 'lassoed' the building with steel cables they attached to a crane, and then pulled until the elevator shaft came toppling down .

"A recent report found that as people upgrade from the iPhone 5S to the 6 and 6 Plus, the amount they use their devices increases. In particular, people with an iPhone 5S were found to use their phones 55 per cent of the time compared to 80 per cent for the 6 Plus. And now a separate study has discovered that all of this extra use equates to twice the amount of mobile data, on average. The figures are taken from Florida-based Citrix’s latest Mobile Analytics Report that collected data usage from mobile network subscribers. The report found iPhone 6 Plus owners use twice the amount of data than the iPhone 6 and this is linked to 6 Plus users being more engaged with their devices . The figures were taken from Florida-based Citrix’s latest Mobile Analytics Report that collected data usage from mobile network subscribers. By studying business and personal use, the report found iPhone 6 Plus owners use twice the amount of data as iPhone 6 users, and 10 times as much as those who own the 3GS. 'iPhone 6 Plus subscribers generate the most data volume, double that of an iPhone 6,' explained the report. Pocket studied more than two million articles and videos opened using its app. It compared the before-and-after behaviour of iPhone and iPad users and found people with an iPhone 5S use their phone 55 per cent of the time. This increases to 72 per cent for the iPhone 6 and 80 per cent for the iPhone 6 Plus - both at the detriment of the iPad. Those with the iPhone 6 now open 33 per cent more articles and videos in Pocket than they did with a 5 or 5S, and those with the 6 Plus open 65 per cent more items than they did with a smaller phone. 'This increase impacts subscribers when choosing a new device [and] clearly the phablet sized iPhone 6 Plus shows data usage patterns more akin to tablet usage.' In a blog post, the firm added: 'Advice to those seeking to upgrade to an iPhone 6 Plus: your data plan bill is about to get bigger!' Citrix links this to the fact iPhone 6 Plus users are typically more engaged with their devices. These claims are in reference to previous research, including stats by Pocket app, which found people with the iPhone 6 open 33 per cent more articles and videos than they did with a 5S, and those with a 6 Plus open 65 per cent more items than before. Pocket found that users with both an iPhone and an iPad watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus.

A promising athlete from the same club which trained some of Britain’s top Olympians has been jailed for robbing teenagers at gunpoint. Abdi Abdi, 19, of Aston, Birmingham, represented Birchfield Harriers - where gold medallists Denise Lewis, Mark Lewis-Francis and Kelly Sotherton all started their careers. But his running career now lies in ruins after he was convicted of firearms and robbery offences committed outside the running club’s Alexander Stadium in Perry Barr, Birmingham, which also hosts the UK Athletics British Grand Prix. A court heard he robbed ‘vulnerable’ teenagers of expensive bikes and mobile phones at a BMX and skateboarding track just half-a-mile away from the famous stadium. Adbi admitted one firearms charge and was convicted of two more as well as three robbery offences after a trial in December. He was sentenced to four years’ detention at Birmingham Crown Court on Friday. Sentencing, Judge Michael Chambers QC said: ‘During the trial your coach spoke about your considerable ability as an athlete and this is the tragedy of this case. ‘You were a promising athlete who had sponsorship and did not need to rob other people. My conclusion is you enjoyed the thrill and peer group esteem from these offences. ‘You and two other Somali young men targeted vulnerable teenage boys with expensive BMX bicycles and mobile phones who frequented the skate park. ‘I am quite satisfied, having heard the evidence, that you planned to rob them. Firearm: The court heard officers found a gun (above) inside his gym bag but the athlete told them he had found it in bushes and was going to hand it in . Scene: Abdi committed the offences outside Birchfield Harriers running club's Alexander Stadium (pictured) in Perry Barr, Birmingham, which also hosts the UK Athletics British Grand Prix . 'You went there late at night and you were armed with an imitation firearm, a gas-powered BB gun which had the appearance of a real handgun. I am also satisfied you were the ringleader.’ The court heard Abdi and two other men picked on lads as young as 15 and produced a gas-powered handgun to force them to hand over belongings. In the first hold-up, the teenager pushed a realistic-looking BB gun into a 16-year-old’s neck and back before the victim fled on June 5 last year. The athlete went back to the park ten days later and robbed three 15-year-olds of their bikes and phones at gunpoint. But Adbi was caught on June 23 when three teenagers saw him cycling through the track in Perry Park and recognised his BMX as stolen. They alerted police who arrived and were forced to use a Taser before arresting the talented runner.

Running star: Mark Lewis-Francis (pictured) also began his career with Birchfield Harriers in Birmingham . The court heard officers found the gun inside his gym bag but the athlete told them he had found it in bushes and was going to hand it in. Abdi committed six robberies between April and June last year where almost £3,000 property was stolen. Balvinder Bhatti, defending, said the athlete was still motivated to continue his running training after his release. She added: ‘The tragedy of this case is that everything you have heard about Abdi and read about him is at odds with the seriousness of the offences for which he has been convicted.’ Speaking after the case, Detective Constable Laurence Green, of West Midlands Police, said: ‘A search of Abdi’s back pack revealed the handgun, although he said that he had found it in bushes and was intending to hand it in to police. ‘He further maintained that he had bought the BMX bike from a man in Alum Rock for £50 and had no knowledge that it was stolen. ‘The lads were aware of the number of robberies happening in the area involving a firearm and the warnings being issued by police to visitors in the park, yet they bravely chased after the offender.’","Abdi Abdi, 19, of Aston, Birmingham, represented Birchfield Harriers .

"Drones could prove invaluable in search and rescue operations as well as disaster scenarios where it is dangerous for relief workers to enter buildings. But currently quadcopters risk injuring humans with their blades and break easily upon light collisions because of their delicate, exposed parts. Now engineers have created the ‘world’s first collision-proof drone’ that has a spherical case, meaning it can bounce around buildings like a ball. Scroll down for video . Engineers have created the ‘world’s first collision-proof drone’ (pictured) that has a spherical case, meaning it can bounce around buildings like a ball . The Gimball drone uses obstacles to find its way around buildings, instead of avoiding them, so it could roll along a row of windows before locating an opening, for example. Scientists from Switzerland’s Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne first unveiled their drone in a roll cage made of pentagons last year, but have now won $1 million in a drone competition sponsored by the United Arab Emirates. ‘Gimball can safely fly indoors and in complex environments, is easy to fly, and can be operated close to humans,’ they say on their website. ‘It solves multiple challenges in inspection of industrial facilities, rail and roadways, firefighting, search and rescue, marketing and communication as well as law enforcement.’ The drone, named Gimball, can fly safely indoors (shown left) and crawl through confined spaces (right) to inspect industrial buildings. It's hopes it could be used to detect survivors in buildings hit by disaster . A pilot from California has teamed up with drone makers to create a global database that lets anyone set up no-fly zones above their homes and offices. To add a zone, users must enter their location, name and an email address to verify the request. This address is converted into a latitude and longitude point, as well as a series of points that accurately marks out the edges of a property. For the first property the site doesn’t ask for proof of residence, but for subsequent addresses users need to show a form of identification or utility bill. The address is then sent to drone makers and added to a no-fly database used each time a drone takes off. Many drones have technology that automatically prevents them flying over registered regions. At launch, founder Ben Marcus has partnered with manufacturers Horizon Hobby, Yuneec, Hexo+, PixiPath, Ehang, Drone Deploy and RCFlyMaps. By partnering with Mr Marcus, these makers promise to adhere to the registered zones but are not under a legal obligation to do so. This means that the machines could provide a cheap, fast and safe alternative to sending humans into crumbling buildings after earthquakes or in warzones, for example. The drone’s rotors are suspended inside a free moving spherical carbon fibre cage so they don’t injure humans, or break when hitting obstacles. Its rotating camera stand - called a gimbal system - and HD camera are also housed in the protective cage. Images sent from the camera to a remote control unit, allow operators to see what the drone is ‘seeing’,The Washington Times reported. Because all the delicate machinery is inside the cage, the drone can bounce between roof rafters and roll along uneven floors without damaging itself - or any nearby humans - and remain stable after a collision. Its structure also enables it to send back close-up images to operators, which could show up details of defects in industrial buildings, for example, Wired reported. The engineers behind the drone also claim that it’s simpler to operate than a conventional quadcopter because the drone can bounce off walls and floors, preventing expensive crashes. The researchers’ company, Flyability, plans to use the prize money to continue developing the drone, including adding infrared night vision and creating software so that it can be easily used by search and rescue professionals. It aims to enable the drone to be used to find victims, as well as detecting chemical leaks and assess damaged infrastructure and buildings. Dr Adrien Briod, CTO and co-founder of the company, said: ‘The funds will be used to finalise the development and manufacturing of our beta prototypes, to allow the delivery to our first customers as early as April 2015’.

"On trial: Brustholm Ziamani, 19, was arrested while carrying a 12-inch knife and a hammer and said he would 'harm' David Cameron if he had the chance, the Old Bailey heard today . A teenage Muslim convert accused of planning to behead a British soldier told police he would 'harm' Prime Minister David Cameron if he had the chance, a court heard. Brustholm Ziamani, 19, was arrested in East London last August carrying a 12-inch knife and a pick hammer wrapped in an Islamic flag after boasting how he was going to 'kill soldiers'. He was previously questioned  by counter-terror police over extremist posts he made online after an earlier arrest last June, his trial at the Old Bailey heard today. In an exchange from one interview read to the jury, he said he would 'do harm' to the Prime Minister if he had the opportunity. He was asked by officers to confirm what he had said in a previous interview, in which the tape recorder had broken. The officer said: 'What would you do if you saw David Cameron and had an opportunity? You said you would do him harm if he had no security around?' Ziamani replied: 'Yes'. He also put posts on Facebook under the name Mujahid Karim supporting Sharia law and stating he was 'willing to die in the cause of Allah', the jury heard. A letter written by Ziamani to his parents in which he talked about being martyred and also the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich in May 2013 was also discussed in the interviews. He told police he ‘didn’t disagree’ with the brutal murder of Lee Rigby and felt it was justified because ‘he had taken part in killing innocent Muslims in Afghanistan’. DC David Atkinson of the Counter Terrorist Command, who stopped Ziamani on the street, told the court he was wanted by police because he had been posting messages on Facebook that encouraged terrorism. DC Atkinson said when he stopped the 19-year-old, he found a large knife and a hammer in his possession. When the knife and hammer were discovered, Ziamani allegedly told officers: ‘You haven’t asked me what they are for.’ He was interviewed at Walworth police station in the presence of his solicitor and said he was upset about the system and the way nothing was being done. Ziamani said he was angry Muslims were being so laid back and not doing anything about it. In court: The jury heard he also put posts on Facebook under the name Mujahid Karim supporting Sharia law and stating he was 'willing to die in the cause of Allah'. Above, a court sketch of Ziamani made yesterday . Ziamani boasted he was part of the Islamic State of Ireland and Britain in a chilling five-page letter to his parents. In the letter for his Christian family he had turned his back on, he boasted that he planned to ‘do a 9/11 and 7/7 and Woolwich all in one day’. He warned: ‘You want war you got it. British soldiers heads will be removed and burned, u cannot defeat the Muslims. We love to die the way you love to live.’ Ziamani told HMP Wandsworth security officer Paul Morris he was on his way to behead a British soldier when he was arrested. He also boasted of knowing one of Lee Rigby’s murderers, Michael Adebolajo, and Muslim hate cleric Anjem Choudary. ‘He said that he had been arrested and he was on his way to an army barracks, he didn’t say where, and said he was going to behead a British soldier and hold his head in the air while a friend unknown was going to photograph him doing so,’ Mr Morris told the jury. ‘He was very, very calm. Very matter of fact.’ Mr Morris had gone to Ziamani’s single-occupancy cell alone for a ‘welfare visit’ and to see how radical or extreme he may be, the court heard. The guard offered him a chance to see one of two Imams at the prison, the jury heard. ‘He said he had already met an Imam, had a disagreement with him and said his ideology would not be changed by anyone, Mr Morris said. ‘We were just having a general chat. He was very polite, very respectful to be fair. ‘He told me he was arrested by police with weapons in his rucksack I believe,’ the officer continued. ‘He said he knew Michael Adebolajo,’ Mr Morris said, adding: ‘He said he loved him and also said he used to hand out Islamic leaflets in Greenwich with him as well.’ Copycat: Ziamani's 'ambition' was to allegedly carry out an attack like one one in Woolwich by extremists Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, left and right, who killed Lee Rigby, the court heard yesterday . Asked if he was worried, Mr Morris replied: ‘I was very concerned. He just seemed so calm, so direct in the way he described. ‘He said there’s nothing I can do to help him. There’s nothing we can do to change his ideology.’ Ziamani also asked about Belmarsh prison where his ‘real brothers’ were and said he knew members of Islamic group Al-Muhajiroun, known as ALM and mentioned Anjem Choudary, the court heard. The prison guard said he offered Ziamani help in the form of a mentor. ‘Mr Ziamani was not interested. He said “my ideology will not be changed by anybody,’ he added. The court has previously heard he researched the location of army cadet bases in the south east of the capital. Ziamani denies planning a terrorist attack. The trial continues.

"Hypnosis helps women recover more quickly from debilitating breast cancer surgery, researchers claim. Patients who are put in a trance just before the operation spend less time in hospital and also have fewer side effects if they need chemotherapy. They are hypnotised by an anaesthetist who talks softly about a chosen topic such as cooking or the beach, before administering a local anaesthetic to numb their breasts. The women do not fall asleep but instead go into a dream-like state. Hypnosis helps women recover more quickly from debilitating breast cancer surgery, researchers claim . Doctors at one hospital in Brussels say the technique has been so successful there that a fifth of the women undergoing surgery for breast cancer are now hypnotised beforehand. In research presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas they compared 110 women who had been hypnotised with 110 undergoing standard surgery. The women who were hypnotised were only given a local anaesthetic - on the presumption that the trance-like state was enough to numb any pain - whereas the others were put to sleep under a general anaesthetic. Researchers found that hypnotised patients spent a day less in hospital afterwards and were keen to be discharged, whereas those given general anaesthetic were not ready to go home. A third of women who then underwent chemotherapy or radiotherapy suffered less severe side effects of fatigue and nausea, the researchers found. Doctors at one hospital in Brussels say the technique has been so successful there that a fifth of the women undergoing surgery for breast cancer are now hypnotised beforehand . Lead researcher Dr Martine Berliere, of the Cliniques Universitaires St Luc in Brussels said it was though the hypnotised patient was in the 'operating room but her spirit is not'. She said it was the first time in her clinical experience patients, had asked to go home so soon: ‘It’s a positive finding, in all cases they said ‘I have recovered and I want to go home.’ It is not clear how hypnosis might speed up recovery times, but the researchers think it some how boosts the immune system. Blood tests afterwards having shown improved lymph node function, in patients that were hypnotised.  The gland plays a crucial role in the immune system by acting as a filter for cancer cells. Dr Berliere said that she hoped that in future research would show hypnosis also prevented cancer from returning. Professor Anthony Howell, a cancer specialist at Manchester University said: ‘I think these data are extremely impressive as they show a rapid recovery. ‘It’s an extremely interesting study.’ However, he said more research would be needed before women could be routinely offered hypnosis before surgery.","One in five breast cancer patients in Brussels is hypnotised before surgery .

"Famed TV host Marc Summers, who helmed the original series of Nickelodeon's Double Dare in the 80s and 90s, has revealed he has been quietly battling cancer for the last five years. The 63-year-old made the admission Monday morning during a radio interview in Philadelphia with WWMR's Preston and Steve. The father-of-two spoke on the show on how he was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 2010 and subsequently underwent two years of chemotherapy. He described his ordeal as 'hell', according to philly.com. Scroll down for video . Big reveal: Marc Summers appeared on radio show WWMR's Preston and Steve on Monday morning and spoke about how he has been battling chronic lymphocytic leukemia for the last five years . Quiet battle: Veteran TV host Marc Summers, 63, has been battling leukemia for the last five years . Summers said he was reluctant to discuss his condition before now because he was worried it might affect his career. He said he and his agents decided to keep it quiet. 'I've sort of compressed this thing and it's made me nuts,' he said. 'I thought it was time to come out. 'I'm not covering up anymore - I've had it, I'm in remission and ... I'm ready to move on.' Doctors gave Summers the all-clear in December. Summers said he considered revealing his story to Oprah Winfrey at the end of last year while appearing on a 'Where Are They Now?' segment. However he said Monday he didn't feel he had as much as of an emotional connection to Winfrey than he did with the crew of WWMR's Preston and Steve. Instead, Summers told Winfrey how his Obsessive Compulsive Disorder - which has spoken about often over the years - affected his career. Happier Times: Summers is seen here with producer Henry Winkler at an event in LA in 2003 . Veteran: Summers, seen here on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in 1994, has been in the industry 30 years . 'I was signed up to do the 'Hollywood Squares' version that Tom Bergeron actually did,' he said. 'The next thing I knew, I was fired before we even got started, supposedly because my reputation was that I was difficult to work with because of the OCD.' In January, WWMR's Steve Morrison revealed he had prostate cancer. Morrison had the prostate removed before the holidays in 2014 and is expected to make a full recovery. Summers is currently hosting Unwrapped, the longest running show on Food Network. He has held the job for 11 years. He has also hosted Next Food Network Star and Ultimate Recipe Showdown.

"Scottish actor David Tennant talked for one minute on the subject of Shakespeare's stage direction, 'Exit, Pursued by a Bear' David Tennant has become the most successful debut contestant on Radio 4’s quiz show Just a Minute. He made it through a full 60 seconds without repetition, hesitation or deviation. The actor talked for one minute on the subject of Shakespeare’s stage direction, ‘Exit, Pursued by a Bear’, without once being interrupted on his very first appearance on the show. It is believed to be the first time in nearly 50 years of the show that a contestant has made such a fluent debut. Host Nicholas Parsons congratulated the Doctor Who and Broadchurch star on his performance. After hearing the effort, which was received with uproarious applause by the Radio 4 audience, the host Mr Parsons said: ‘A newcomer, coming on in this very difficult game, we make it sound easy for the listeners. And it is very difficult. ‘And you have gone on, on your first attempt, speaking for 60 seconds without repetition, hesitation or deviation. Well done… I think you can relax now David.’ The actor replied: ‘Can I leave now before I ruin my record?’ The episode, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 last night, saw him join Stephen Fry, Julian Clary and Paul Merton for the Just a Minute challenge. Mr Tennant  delighted with his first topic, Shakespeare’s stage direction from The Winter’s Tale ‘Exit, Pursued by a Bear’. Calling it ‘the most famous direction in theatrical history’, Mr Tennant – who recently appeared on stage in Hamlet – spoke at length about the precise staging of the play. The long-running quiz show, which began in 1967, sees contestants challenged to speak for one minute ‘without repetition, hesitation or deviation’. It has played host to the cream of British acting and comic talent over the years. A spokesman for Radio 4 said the Just a Minute team could not recall any other example of a newcomer making it through a full minute on their first attempt saying it was ‘very possibly’ the only time it had happened.

"The Oscar curse suggests that winners of the award will be destined for misfortune as soon as they get their hands on that golden statue. Nicholas Cage, Halle Berry and Kirk Douglas and  have all been victims, as has Sam Mendes and Sandra Bullock. And for male actors in particular, that misfortune is likely to be romantic rather than professional, according to a new study. The Oscar curse suggests that winners of the award will be destined for misfortune as soon as they get their hands on that golden statue. Kate Winslet and Sam Mendes announced their divorce a year after she won the Best Actress Oscar for The Reader in 2009 . The research, led by University of Michigan, found that the sudden shift in fortunes can have a damaging impact on relationships. 'Since many aspects of our lives are organised as winner-take-all tournaments, it's necessary to be aware of the potential downsides,' Michael Jensen, a strategy professor at Michigan's Ross School of Business. They found specialising in action films increases the divorce rate of male actors, but not the divorce rate of female actors . The Oscar curse goes back to the 1930s and Hollywood's golden age. Luise Rainer, the first actor to win multiple Oscars, blamed her wins for 'The Great Ziegfeld' in 1936 and 'The Good Earth' in 1937, for the rapid decline of her career. Nicholas Cage (left) and Sandra Bullock (right) have all been victims after both going through a divorce after winning an Oscar. The study suggests men are worse hit than women. Specialising in action films increases the divorce rate of male actors, the study found . The researchers claim male actors, but not female actors, are more likely to divorce if their spouse is nominated for or wins an Oscar, Reese Witherspoon split from her husband Ryan Phillippe in 2007 - one year after she took home the Best Actress award for Walk The Line . Professor Jensen and co-author Heeyon Kim of the National University of Singapore, found no evidence of negative professional consequences for male or female actors. The study confirmed there are fewer roles for female actors than male actors. Married male actors participate in more movies than divorced male actors, whereas divorced female actors participate in more movies than married female actors. Hollywood is not ready for female action heroes: Specialising in action films increases movie participation for male actors but decreases movie participation for female actors. Male action heroes are more likely to divorce: Specializing in action films increases the divorce rate of male actors, but not the divorce rate of female actors. Male actors, but not female actors, are more likely to divorce if their spouse is nominated for or wins an Oscar. Oscar winners appear, on average, in more films following their wins than Oscar nominees and other actors. 'The professional Oscar curse is, in other words, only a Hollywood myth,' Professor Jensen said. 'The personal consequences of the Oscars are different.' The researchers looked at overall divorce rates of Oscar winners and nominees, and found that they weren't all that different from other actors. However, they found that male actors who won an Oscar were three times as likely - and nominees were twice as likely - as other male actors to divorce during their first year of marriage. Female Oscar winners and nominees were much less likely to divorce than other female actors. The team came to the conclusion after examining all actors who played lead roles in 1,023 top commercial and top artistic films from 1930 to 2005 - a sample of 808 actors that included 165 Oscar winners and 227 Oscar nominees who did not win. Kirk Douglas, one of the actors nominated for Oscars but did not win and went on to get divorced not long after. in this image Michael Douglas (left) greets his father Kirk  as they arrive at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party in 2012 . They analysed male and female elite actors separately because the labor markets and Oscar success criteria for male and female screen actors are different. 'Our results emphasise an important conundrum for male actors - Oscar nominations/wins can help a career but can also ruin a marriage,' Professor Jensen said. They also found that male actors, but not female actors, are more likely to divorce if their spouse is nominated for or wins an Oscar. However, a separate study in 2011 found that the Best Actress winners were more likely to end up divorced than others who had been nominated but failed to win a gold statuette. Researchers at the University of Toronto in Canada found that female winners of the top acting award have a 63 per cent chance of having a shorter marriage than non winners. At the time, British star Kate Winslet, Sandra Bullock and Hilary Swank are all among the most recent winners who saw their careers hit new heights but their personal lives go in the opposite direction. A year after winning the Best Actress award playing a concentration camp guard in The Reader in 2009 her marriage to director Sam Mendes ended. A separate study in 2011 found that the Best Actress winners were more likely to end up divorced than others who had been nominated but failed to win a gold statuette.

"A convicted murderer who was given a lethal injection for the brutal killing of a special education teacher sang for a minute after receiving his fatal dose before he was pronounced dead. Walter Timothy Storey, 47, died nine minutes after receiving the lethal drug at 12.01am on Wednesday at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri. In a final statement, Storey said: 'For this world full of anger, hate and revenge, I would like to pray for peace, forgiveness and love! I love everyone, even those who are doing this deed.' Convicted murderer Walter Timothy Storey (pictured left  in 2012 and right in his 1990 arrest photo) died on Wednesday at 12.10am, nine minutes after receiving lethal injection in Bonne Terre, Missouri . On February 2 1990, a drunk Storey, then 22, broke into an apartment next door to his mother's home in St Charles, where he was living, to steal money for more beer. Jill Frey, a 36-year-old special education teacher, had left the sliding glass door on to her balcony open. Storey confronted Miss Frey in her bedroom and viciously beat her, leaving the woman with six broken ribs and severe head and facial wounds. He used a kitchen knife to slit her throat so deeply that her spine was damaged. Miss Frey died of blood loss and asphyxiation. The killer then returned the next day to clean up blood, throw clothes in a trash bin and scrub Miss Frey's fingernails to remove any traces of his skin. The 36-year-old's body was discovered after she failed to report for work on Monday morning. However Storey failed to spot a key piece of evidence: blood on a dresser. Victim: Special education teacher Jill Frey, pictured, was brutally beaten and had her throat slit by Storey in 1990 at her St Charles, Missouri home . 'There was a really good palm print in blood,' said Mike Harvey, a retired St. Charles detective who now works as an investigator for the St. Charles County prosecutor. Lab analysis matched the print to Storey, whose prints were on file for a previous crime. The St Louis-Dispatch reported that the victim's brother, Jeff Frey, was among the 14 people who watched Storey die. He read a statement which said: 'This guy had no mercy on Jill but now we are expected to have mercy on him.' His sister had dedicated her life to helping children with special needs, Mr Frey said, adding: 'To say Jill was a special person is an understatement.' He said that waiting 25 years to watch Storey executed had been excruciating for Jill's loved ones and that her parents had passed away before they could see their daughter's killer die. Storey claimed that he had been upset over his pending divorce when he killed Miss Frey. Storey was convicted and sentenced to death. He was executed on Wednesday after losing an 11th hour-appeal to the Supreme Court on grounds that the lethal injection could cause a painful death. Missouri obtains execution drug, pentobarbital, from an unnamed compounding pharmacy, and prison officials refused to disclose details about how or if it has been tested. Storey's attorney argued that the secrecy made it impossible to know if the barbiturate would work quickly or cause an unconstitutionally painful death. The U.S. Supreme Court and Missouri Governor Jay Nixon denied appeals to spare his life. It was Missouri's first execution of the year after the state executed a record ten inmates in 2014. Last month, the Supreme Court put three executions in Oklahoma on hold until a decision is reached on the method of lethal injection used. Storey was sentenced to death three separate times in the case. The Missouri Supreme Court tossed the murder conviction the first time, citing concerns about ineffective assistance of counsel and 'egregious' errors committed by Kenny Hulshof, who was with the Missouri attorney general's office at the time and handled the prosecution. Mr Hulshof was later a congressman and a candidate for governor. Storey was tried again in 1997, and sentenced again to death. That conviction was also overturned, due to a procedural error by the judge. Storey was sentenced to death a third time in 1999. Storey's lawyer had said he was remorseful for his crimes and had spent 'thousands of hours' working in a restorative justice program in prison, trying to help crime victims. U.S. states have executed seven people so far in 2015 after putting 35 inmates to death last year., according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Missouri will change its time for executions from midnight to 6pm starting with the next scheduled execution in March, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch. A local anti-death penalty group held a vigil on Tuesday night into Wednesday morning in Springfield, the state capital.","Walter Storey, 47, executed for 1990 killing of school teacher neighbor Jill Frey at her home in St Charles, Missouri .

"In 2011 the RAF launched an investigation into whether the first female Red Arrow, Flight Lieutenant Kirsty Stewart, was having an affair with squadron leader Ben Murphy but found no evidence of one. But now the pair have both left the famous aerobatic flying team and are set to marry. Ms Stewart, 36, joined the elite squadron, based at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire, in 2010. Shortly afterwards rumours began circulating that she was seeing Mr Murphy, 38. Plane-ly in love: Kirsty Stewart - the first female Red Arrows pilot - is to marry her former Arrows Team Leader Ben Murphy . Ms Stewart and Mr Murphy have both now left the Red Arrows and are said to be living together . The gossip gathered so much momentum that in 2011 the RAF began an investigation into the matter. The relationship was reportedly disrupting the dynamic of the team. A source told The Sun: ‘The team as a whole became very unhappy and dysfunctional. Knowledge of the allegations went right to the top of the RAF.’ The investigation did not find any evidence of improper conduct, so the pair, who are both divorced, continued flying. In 2011 the RAF investigated rumours that Kirsty Stewart and Ben Murphy were having an affair, with their alleged relationship reportedly distrupting the team dynamic . Mr Murphy left the Red Arrows not long after the RAF’s probe, and Ms Stewart, who flew as Red 9, left in March 2012 claiming to have been affected mentally by the deaths of two of the team’s pilots. Flight Lieutenant Jon Egging, from Rutland, died when his plane crashed near Bournemouth Airport in Dorset in August 2011 and Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham died on November 8, 2011, when the ejection seat suddenly engaged while his Hawk T1 aircraft was still on the runway at RAF Scampton. It’s understood that Ms Stewart and Mr Murphy are now living together. Sources told The Sun that she has ‘a big rock on her finger’. Mr Murphy now works for defence and aerospace giant Lockheed Martin while Ms Stewart is still employed by the RAF, but in ground roles.","Kirsty Stewart and Ben Murphy flew with the Red Arrows until 2012 .

"A 19 year old woman has fronted court, accused of supplying the prohibited drug which allegedly killed her best friend. Rebecca Hannibal from Cammeray in Sydney’s north, is accused of giving an ecstasy pill to her best friend Georgina Bartter in November last year. Ms Bartter was just 19 when she died after collapsing on the dance floor at Harbourlife Dance Party at Mrs Macquarie’s Chair in Sydney. Georgina Bartter (far right) died from a suspected adverse reaction to a drug. One of her best friends Rebecca Hannibal (centre) has been charged with supplying the prohibited drug after allegedly buying the drug for Ms Bartter . Ms Hannibal (left) and Ms Bartter, both 19, were very close friends and had just returned from a five week European holiday together with a group of friends . Ms Bartter (behind) was so close with Ms Hannibal (front) that she gave a speech at her 18th birthday party . The university student was rushed to St Vincent's Hospital but died from multiple organ failure. The coroner's report is yet to be released but it is reported that Ms Bartter died after taking 'one and a half pills' of a drug known as a 'purple speaker'. Ms Hannibal was arrested in relation to her friend's death in December and made an appearance at court last week. Her arrest was allegedly kept quiet so police could continue their investigations in the hope of making further arrests, according to Sydney Morning Herald. 'A 19-year-old Cammeray woman was charged on 23rd December 2014 with supplying a prohibited drug,' NSW Police confirmed to Daily Mail Australia. 'She appeared at Downing Centre Local Court on 4th February 2015. 'There she was bailed prior to reappearing at that same court on 18th March.' Ms Hannibal reportedly also plead not guilty to one charge of drug supply during her court appearance, according to Sydney Morning Herald. Ms Hannibal (left) was arrested and charged on December 23, more than a month after Ms Bartter's tragic death on November 8 . Facebook is filled with photos of them together, with the teens pictured celebrating and carefree at Ms Hannibal's 18th . Tragically, the two young women shared a very close bond. They were 'best friends' and had travelled to Europe for five weeks together just months before Ms Bartter's death. Facebook is filled with photos of them together, with the teens pictured celebrating and carefree at Ms Hannibal's 18th. They pose for photos with wide grins and silly faces. Ms Bartter, as one of her closest friends, gave a speech that night about her long-time friend. A day at Harbourlife Festival was intended to be just another fun day for the two friends before it went horribly wrong. Detectives from Sydney City Local Area Command established Strike Force Oibell to investigate the supply of prohibited drugs in Sydney. Two people have now been charged in relation to the death of Georgina Bartter, after police arrested the man accused of selling the drugs to Ms Hannibal on Saturday. Police will allege that Ms Hannibal bought the drugs from Matthew Forti, also 19 in the days leading up to the festival. The 19-year-old man was finally arrested at Willoughby in north Sydney on February 7, following months of police investigations. More than 5,000 people had attended the dance party where police arrested 78 people for drug offences. Following extensive investigations, police alleged that the man had in his possession an amount of prohibited drugs during a search. The 19-year-old woman was at Harbourlife festival at Mrs Macquarie's Chair near Sydney Botanical Gardens . Bartter later died after reportedly taking 'one and a half pills' of the drug known as purple speaker . Hundreds attended her funeral service St Mary's Catholic Church in North Sydney a week after her death . Detectives executed a search warrant at a home on Robert Street, where they located and seized further drugs. The drugs have been seized and will undergo forensic examinations. The man was was taken to Chatswood Police Station where he was received three charges of supplying prohibited drugs, as well as charge for a possessing prohibited drug. He was granted conditional bail to appear at Downing Centre Local Court on March 25. Investigations by Strike Force Oibell continue.

"GP receptionists are being sent on customer care courses to stop them being rude to patients. The sessions are being trialled in 90 surgeries following a surge in complaints from the public that they were being ‘patronised’ and ‘spoken to like idiots’. All 802 receptionists and administration staff are being sent on the three-hour courses which teach them how to ‘understand anger’ and be respectful. GP receptionists are being sent on customer care courses to stop them being rude to patients. Stock photo . The courses are being rolled out in two health trusts – Bradford City Clinical Commissioning Group and Bradford District Clinical Commissioning Group – which serve about half a million patients. Managers said they had decided to fund the £33,000 cost of the trial after listening carefully to ‘frustrated patients’. One patient, at the Horton Bank Practice in Bradford, said: ‘Receptionists are often rude and patronising.’ Writing on the NHS Choices website, the patient added: ‘I am often being spoken to like an idiot.’ Another, a patient at the city’s Manningham Medical Practice, said: ‘Most of the receptionists are unpleasant to talk to and not very helpful.’ A patient at the Lister Surgery claimed that staff were ‘unfriendly, lazy and rude’ and could rarely answer questions. A report in 2012 blamed a sudden surge in complaints by patients on unhelpful and surly receptionists. The Health and Social Care Information Centre highlighted how there were 9,924 grievances about ‘general practice administration’ – a rise of a quarter in just 12 months. The customer care scheme – unearthed by GP magazine Pulse – is believed to be the first of its kind, but if deemed a success other areas could follow suit. Sessions began in November and will last until April, and are taught by private consultancy firm Striding Edge. More than 800 receptionists and administration staff are being sent on the three-hour courses in Bradford. Pictured, The Grange Practice in Bradford . NHS managers said that so far there had been an ‘enthusiastic response’ from those receptionists who had been on the courses. Dr Andy Withers, clinical chairman of Bradford Districts CCG, said: ‘Listening to patients and GPs about the shared concerns and challenges experienced in general practice will lead to better access and use of services. Improving patients’ access to primary care services is a priority for us, and that’s why we’ve set up this training. ‘GP receptionists are often the first point of contact for a patient, so it’s vital they make a positive impression. We’ve had a really good response from local practices to the offer of training and I’m confident that this will further improve customer service and communication skills.’ Sharon Barraclough, business development manager at The Grange Practice in Bradford who helped set up the scheme, said: ‘The benefit of good customer service cannot be underestimated, and for many receptionists the favourite part of their job is the interaction they have with patients – however, it’s not always the easiest part. ‘Training is vital to what we do “on the front line” and this course recognises the important role every member of the practice team plays in making sure all patients receive the best quality of care possible.’","GP receptionists in Bradford are being sent on three-hour courses .

"Helen Carter, 40, kissed a teenage girl pupil and encouraged her to send sexually explicit images of herself . A teacher who started a sexual relationship and had 'phone sex' with a pupil after she came out as a lesbian has been jailed for 12 months. Helen Carter, 40, kissed the teenage pupil while working at Bromfords School in Wickford, Essex, and encouraged her to send sexually explicit images of herself. The disgraced teacher encouraged her to send pictures of her naked breast and used a heavily encrypted messaging application to swap messages. Judge Jonathan Black described Carter's actions as a 'gross abuse of trust' as he jailed the former English teacher for 12 months at Basildon Crown Court. He said: 'The victim described how you had become close, exchanging explicit sexual messages and texts. 'She described these messages in terms as 'having phone sex'. 'She also described how the relationship became more sexual. 'Each of you would send each other explicit sexual messages describing what you would do to the other sexually were you to live together. 'In some of these messages, you asked her if she was masturbating whilst sending the messages inciting her to masturbate. 'In my view, your behaviour towards this child in your care constitutes a gross abuse of trust.' Carter started working at Bromfords School - a large secondary school with more than 1,000 pupil - as an English teacher in September 2012. The under-fire school was rated as 'requires improvement' by Ofsted in November last year. Past pupils include Big Brother winners Brian Belo and Chantelle Houghton. The court heard how a relationship had grown between the lesbian teacher and the victim after she came out to her at school. Miss Nneka Akudolu, prosecuting, said: 'She said she had approached Miss Carter and had come out to her as she would go to her if she had any problems. 'It was not long after Miss Carter had declared she was also gay that they struck up a friendship. 'She had just broken up with her girlfriend and had fallen out with her best friend. 'At the time, the defendant was pretty much her only friend.' The friendship developed into an illicit relationship with sexually explicit messages being shared over internet app, Telegram. The social messaging app is heavily encrypted and can be set to automatically destroy messages after a set period of time. The disgraced teacher at Bromfords School in Wickford, Essex incited her to send pictures of her naked breast and used a heavily encrypted messaging application, to swap messages . Family of the teenage victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, became suspicious and discovered a selection of incriminating messages when checking her iPad. Police were contacted and Miss Carter was arrested at the school in May last year. Miss Akudolu continued: 'The Crown would assert this was a vulnerable individual but I'm not sure if I can say she was targeted. 'There is a question mark if she was groomed.' In one of the messages the victim offered to buy Carter a birthday cake adding: 'When we're laying together and we wake up in each other's arms we'll smear each other with cake.' Mike Warren, mitigating, said his client had struggled with the stress of her first teaching position and was 'emotionally fragile'. Judge Jonathan Black described Carter's actions as a 'gross abuse of trust'as he jailed the former English teacher for 12 months at Basildon Crown Court . He added: 'Miss Carter embarked on teaching at a late stage in life. 'Not wishing to speak ill of the school, it was a school that had special measures issues and she found it difficult to cope. 'She was a fairly isolated person and the victim seemed to gain as much from the friendship with the defendant as the defendant did with her. 'She does not seek to put any blame on the victim and acknowledges this is her own fault.' Carter admitted four counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust, three counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity by a person in a position of trust and one count of making indecent images of a child. She was sentenced to 12 months in jail and was ordered to pay £100 victim surcharge. The former teacher was also placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years and was made the subject of a sexual offence prevention order for 10 years.","Helen Carter, 40, shared explicit messages and pictures with  teenage pupil .

"The family of an Ethiopian runner who famously won an Olympic marathon barefoot is suing Vibram, the maker of a popular line of minimalist running shoes, saying it used his name without permission. Abebe Bikila, who died in 1973, was a last-minute entrant in the 1960 Olympics in Rome and didn't like the fit of the shoes he'd been provided. Running barefoot over the cobbled streets, he shattered the existing Olympic record, finishing in just over two hours, 15 minutes. The family of Ethiopian runner, Abebe Bikila, who famously won an Olympic marathon barefoot, is suing Vibram, the maker of a popular line of minimalist running shoes, saying it used his name without permission . Running barefoot over the cobbled streets, Bikila shattered the existing Olympic record, finishing in just over two hours, 15 minutes. He is the only person to win gold in the marathon while running barefoot . Vibram named some models of its Five Fingers foot-glove style running shoes after him, and even trademarked the name 'Bikila' in 2010 as barefoot or nearly barefoot running became more popular in the United States. Bikila's victory in Rome is legendary among running fans, as he was a last-minute addition to the Ethiopian team when another runner fell ill . But in a lawsuit filed Monday in federal court in Tacoma, Bikila's son, Teferi Bikila, of Tigard, Oregon, said the company didn't have permission to do so. 'He won the Rome marathon with bare feet, and nobody did it before then or since then,' Bikila, 45, said in a phone interview Tuesday. 'It's important that his legacy be respected.' The family is seeking at least $15million in damages, said their attorney, Alex Trauman. A Boston law firm that has previously represented Vibram said Tuesday it was not authorized to comment on the lawsuit. Vibram President Michael V. Gionfriddo did not immediately return a voice mail message left at the company's headquarters in Concord, Massachusetts. Bikila's victory in Rome is legendary among running fans, as he was a last-minute addition to the Ethiopian team when another runner fell ill. The running shoes he was issued caused blisters, and he decided to run barefoot — the way he had trained — along a course that passed the Obelisk of Axum, a granite monument the Italian fascists plundered from Ethiopia in 1937 after they conquered the country. He won the gold, beating what was then the Olympic record by about eight minutes. Bikila also went on to win the 1964 Olympic marathon in Tokyo — just 40 days after having his appendix out. He wore shoes for that race. In 1969, a car crash left him paralyzed, and he died of complications a few years later. The complaint alleges violations of federal law as well as Washington's Personality Rights Act. Washington's Personality Rights Act is considered one of the most progressive such laws in the nation because it specifies that the heirs of a deceased person can continue to assert personality rights. Michael Atkins, a Seattle trademark lawyer who is not involved in the lawsuit, said it appears that the family has a solid claim. 'The personal rights statute says every person has a right to control their own name,' Atkins said. 'Whether you're a celebrity or an ordinary Joe, no one can use your name to promote their product without your permission,' he added. Vibram named some models of its Five Fingers foot-glove style running shoes after him and trademarked the name 'Bikila' in 2010 .","Abebe Bikila won a gold medal in the 1960 Olympics after running marathon barefoot when the shoes he was provided with gave him blisters .

"The two Malaysia Airlines' disasters in 2014 have had a 'significant impact' on the numbers of Britons holidaying in Malaysia. Malaysia has dipped from ninth place last year to 16th this year in a list of best-selling destinations compiled by Kuoni. In March last year Malaysia Airlines MH370, with 227 passengers and 12 crew aboard, disappeared in the Indian Ocean. Travel to Malaysia has slipped from ninth in the list to 16th in data released by Kuoni in their projections for long-haul holidays for 2015 . The Malaysia Airlines' disasters, including the MH17 that was shot down over Ukraine, has seen the number of Britons visiting Malaysia fall . Then on July 17 the carrier's flight MH17 was shot down over war-torn Ukraine, with the loss of 298 lives, including 10 Britons. Kuoni said today: 'The Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crash in July last year following the missing plane has impacted significantly on sales (to Malaysia).' 1. Maldives . 2. Thailand . 3. UAE (Dubai and Abu Dhabi) 4. Sri Lanka . 5. USA . 6. Mauritius . 7. Cuba . 8. Antigua . 9. Singapore . 10. Barbados . Publishing its long-haul destination report for 2015, Kuoni said the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Mexico and Cambodia were the fastest-growing long-haul holiday destinations for British travellers. The Dominican Republic moved from 38th place last year to 23rd place in the list of top destinations, while Cuba, at seventh, is at its highest-ever placing. Other emerging destinations for 2015 include Ethiopia, which has been added to Kuoni’s 2015 touring programme for the first time, and the Philippines, which are now more accessible with a direct flight from London to Manila. The Maldives was once again the top destination, followed by Thailand, the United Arab Emirates and Sri Lanka. Kuoni's managing director Derek Jones said: 'This has been one of the busiest January periods I can remember. 'In our 50th year of operating in the UK market, we can clearly see how travel trends have changed over the decades. 'Destinations such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, which were once the domain of backpackers, have become popular for mainstream travellers of all ages who want adventure combined with comfort and style.' Top of the tree for where Britons will holiday to in 2015 on long-haul trips is The Maldives, and it's easy to see why .

"The six-year police veteran who was shot dead this weekend in a grisly murder-suicide at a Dallas apartment was allegedly abusive to the shooter, who told a 911 operator she was his girlfriend before turning the gun on herself. On Monday, police identified the shooter as 42-year-old Otto Machelle Thomas. They say Thomas called 911 around 6:15pm to report that she had murdered her boyfriend, 40-year-old Larry Tuttle, and that someone needed to come pick up her 6-year-old daughter. Thomas revealed her motives to the operator, saying: 'He was getting ready to hit me again and I just went off. I killed him because he was going to hit me again.' Scroll down for video . Murder-suicide: 42-year-old mother Otto Machelle Thomas, left, called 911 on Saturday to say she shot dead her boyfriend 40-year-old cop Larry Tuttle, right, because she feared he would hit her 'again'. When officers arrived on the scene, Thomas committed suicide by shooting herself . When officers arrived at the scene, they ordered Thomas to  put away her weapon and unlock the door to Tuttle's apartment. Instead, she walked away from the window and a gunshot was heard. SWAT teams swarmed the apartment and found the couple dead, with Thomas' young daughter uninjured in a bedroom. Her daughter, who neighbors say is autistic, has been transferred to the care of Child Protective Services, which are trying to get in contact with Thomas' family in Mississippi. Police say there have been no prior disturbance or domestic violence calls to the apartment. Tuttle's wife Kandie Morgan told KXAS- TV that they had been separated for a few months, and that he had been a great father to their 10-year-old son. Police are unsure whether Thomas was living with Tuttle at the apartment. They say she recently lived in an apartment in Arlington. Left behind: SWAT teams stormed Tuttle's apartment and found the couple dead, with Thomas' 6-year-old daughter uninjured in a bedroom . Thomas was featured in a short article in a 2001 issue of Ebony magazine, which described her as a military police officer in the Army who counseled youth groups. At the time she was living in Kansas City, Kansas and that she had a son, suggesting that she has an older child. She has no other criminal record besides a 1996 harassment charge in Bell County, Texas that was dismissed. Tuttle's neighbor Jared Ingram said he often saw the father and his son around the Lake Highlands Landing apartments. '[They were] playing with different things, playing with his toys, cleaning up his house sometimes, things like that,' Ingram said, adding that Tuttle was a 'good neighbor'. The Dallas Police Association wrote on Facebook Monday that Tuttle was a 'great officer who will never be forgotten'.","Shooter has been identified as 42-year-old mother Otto Machelle Thomas .

"Dangerous teeth-whitening products are being sold to unsuspecting customers on the internet. The scale of the problem was laid bare last night when Trading Standards officers revealed they seized illegal whitening kits worth more than £500,000 from a house in London. The medical-grade treatments are being sold with nearly 60 times the legal level of bleaching agent hydrogen peroxide. The illegal gels, which promise to whiten teeth in just seven days, are being marketed as a cheap alternative to professional whitening services. However, dentists say they can lead to mouth blisters and irritated, extremely sensitive gums. Trading Standards officers in Hillingdon, west London have seized 12,000 teeth-whitening kits worth in excess of £500,000 amid fears the products could cause painful blisters to the mouth and gums because of high levels of hydrogen peroxide . Teeth-whitening has become increasingly popular as more Britons seek the Hollywood smile sported by celebrities. But with professional whitening costing up to £700, some are tempted by cheaper kits offered online. As a result, fraudsters have moved in on the business – with some selling pirated kits turned out in overseas factories using substandard and even risky ingredients. The latest batch of seized products, found in a house in Hillingdon, West London, contained 5.9 per cent hydrogen peroxide, meaning they could only be legally supplied to dental practitioners. Without the proper medical training, a higher dosage of hydrogen peroxide than is safe can easily end up being applied and lead to teeth and gum damage. According to European law, teeth-whitening products are only safe to be sold directly to customers if they contain a maximum of 0.1 per cent hydrogen peroxide. Uxbridge Magistrates' Court has now issued a court order for the 12,000 seized kits to be destroyed. Hillingdon Council said they belonged to a Polish national called Piotr Kaszubski, who has since fled the country. A spokesman said: 'Trading Standards officers uncovered evidence that the goods were being supplied online to consumers with inadequate checks being made. Mr Kaszubski has returned to Poland and stated that he was merely an agent for an American company, so it was decided to seek forfeiture of the products worth in excess of £500,000.' Checks by the Mail indicate that some of the products, which go by the branding Whitetime Dental Expert, were still being sold online last night. According to one website: 'You do not have to spend hundreds for professional teeth whitening. Whitetime is the answer.' Hillingdon councillor Jonathan Bianco said: 'Products like this should only be used under the supervision of a qualified dental practitioner. The kits were seized from a residential property in Sipson, near Heathrow. Experts warn the strong bleaching gels, which are 5.9 per cent hydrogen peroxide, should only be handled by a dental practitioner (file image) 'We always put our residents first and our trading standards team work hard to identify and seize dangerous products, and prosecute when possible.' Last month the General Dental Council secured its first prosecution of someone illegally training others to carry out teeth-whitening. Martyn Collier, a beauty trainer from Monmouthshire, was fined £11,490 for illegally training beauticians in the service. Only dentists are permitted to carry out teeth-whitening in Britain. Nicolas Martin, professor of restorative dentistry at the University of Sheffield, said that hydrogen peroxide is dangerous if not applied by a medical professional. 'If a dentist does not regulate their use, there is a risk of harm,' he said. 'There is a further risk that unregulated products used by individuals without professional supervision may be more caustic and/or toxic and potentially cause severe and dangerous injuries.'","Trading Standards officers seized 12,000 kits from a home in West London .

"Malaysia's opposition leader said he was the victim of a 'political conspiracy' as the nation's highest court upheld his conviction for sodomy. Anwar Ibrahim will now go immediately to prison to serve the five year sentence he was given in March 2014. The Federal Court rejected his appeal, saying there was 'overwhelming evidence' that he had sodomised a young former aide. The decision was  criticised by the United States, Australia and human rights organisations. Malaysia's opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim faces a lengthy prison sentence after his appeal against a sodomy conviction was rejected by the Federal Court . Shortly after the decision was announced, Anwar launched a scathing attack on the justices, accusing them of collusion in a 'political conspiracy' by Malaysia's authoritarian regime. 'In bowing to the dictates of your political masters, you have become partners to the crime,' he said. 'You have chosen to be on the dark side.' 'I will not be silenced! I will never surrender!' Anwar shouted at the judges as they abruptly got up to leave. Sodomy is punishable by up to 20 years in prison in Muslim-majority Malaysia. Anwar was taken from the court in the afternoon to begin his sentence. Government critics call the case part of a long-running campaign to destroy Anwar, a former deputy premier who was ousted from the ruling party in the late 1990s and later helped unite a previously divided and hapless opposition into a formidable force. The ruling is a heavy blow to both Anwar and the opposition. Anwar is now 67. Even if freed early, he is barred from politics for five years after his release, making another comeback unlikely. Graphic showing a timeline of legal battles for Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim . 'This is a struggle. Not only for Anwar but for all Malaysians, against a regime that will stoop to anything for political gain,' Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, Anwar's wife and president of his political party, told local media. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has previously admitted meeting Anwar's accuser, Mohamad Saiful Bukhari Azlan, in 2008 just before the charges were filed, but denies orchestrating the case. A statement by his office insisted the court reached the verdict 'only after considering all the evidence in a balanced and objective manner,' and called on all parties to respect the decision. But the ruling drew harsh criticism. A US embassy statement said 'the United States is deeply disappointed and concerned,' adding that the episode 'raised serious concerns regarding the rule of law and the independence of the courts.' Malaysian riot-police stand guard outside the Federal Court in Putrajaya, outside Kuala Lumpur, on February 10, 2015 . Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said her government was 'deeply concerned by the severity of the sentence.' Amnesty International called it 'deplorable' and part of a Malaysian government campaign to silence critics. 'We consider Anwar Ibrahim to be a prisoner of conscience,' it said. It is the second disputed sodomy conviction for Anwar in a career marked by sharp ups and downs. - 'Overwhelming evidence' - . He was a popular top leader of the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) until his ouster in a bitter 1998 power struggle that saw him arrested and jailed for six years on previous sodomy and corruption charges. That case was widely viewed as tainted by politics, and the sodomy conviction was eventually thrown out. Wan Azizah -- the wife of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim -- leaves after her husband's appeal on a sodomy conviction was rejected by the federal court in Putrajaya, outside Kuala Lumpur, on February 10, 2015 . Supporters of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim shout slogans outside the Federal Court in Putrajaya, outside Kuala Lumpur, on February 10, 2015 . Later joining the opposition, Anwar led a three-party alliance to the brink of ousting UMNO, one of the world's longest-ruling parties. But the alliance risks falling apart over deep policy and personality differences. Sidelining Anwar raises troubling new questions, especially with no clear successor in the wings. Analysts, however, say jailing Anwar also bears risks for Najib's regime, which lost the popular vote in 2013 elections, but clung to power through gerrymandering. 'Jail time will make Anwar a martyr for a new generation, rally his supporters at home and abroad and signal the weakness of (Najib's) government in its need to remove an opponent,' Bridget Welsh, a Southeast Asia politics analyst with National Taiwan University, wrote in a recent essay. Malaysia's Federal Court ruled that Mohamad Saiful Bukhari Azlan -- a former aide to Anwar Ibrahim -- gave 'credible' evidence during a 2008 sodomy trial in Kuala Lumpur . UMNO has a history of using police and judicial organs to pressure opponents. The current charges were filed in 2008 shortly after the first of two historic Anwar-led opposition election showings. Many legal experts had expected Anwar's acquittal, but Chief Justice Arifin Zakaria said in reading out the court's judgement that it found Saiful's accusations 'credible'. 'We have overwhelming evidence that (Saiful) was sodomised,' he said, adding that Anwar's conspiracy allegations 'remain unsubstantiated'. UMNO has dominated multi-ethnic Malaysia since independence in 1957, but has rapidly lost ground to the opposition Pakatan Rakyat (People's Pact) alliance, which vows to dismantle UMNO's authoritarian rule and crony capitalism, and to reform discriminatory policies favouring the ethnic Malay majority.","Anwar Ibrahim was jailed for five years by Malaysia's highest court .

"A California man is facing multiple charges in relation to the death of a transgender woman who allegedly died from an unregulated silicone injection he gave her at a party. Liborio De La Luz Ramos, 44, was arrested Thursday and charged with one felony count of voluntary manslaughter by an unlawful act and two felony counts of unauthorized practice of medicine, the Los Angeles Times reports. Ramos is neither licensed to practice medicine nor is he allowed to perform  surgical procedures. Charges: Liborio De La Luz Ramos, 44 (photographed), is facing multiple charges in relation to the death of a transgender woman who allegedly died from an unregulated silicone injection he gave her at a party . But police say he did just that, giving Felipe 'Katya' De La Riva, 40, the silicone injections to her buttocks that allegedly led to her death. Ramos and Riva met through Santa Ana's transgender community, ABC reports, and Riva reportedly received the injection from Ramos to enhance her buttocks in late December at a 'silicone party' in a Santa Ana hotel. On Jan. 1, Riva admitted herself into Kaiser Hospital because of a respiratory problem, according to a police report.

"Battered: Graffiti artist Combo suffered a dislocated shoulder after being attacked by a gang for painting a mural calling for religious harmony in Paris . A French graffiti artist has told how he was attacked by a gang  after refusing to take down a mural calling for religious harmony in Paris. The artist, known as Combo, 28, was left with a dislocated shoulder and bruises across his face after being set upon in a ghetto in the east of the capital. He had just finished a design that featured the word 'coexist' written with a Muslim crescent for letter C, a Star of David as the X and a Christian cross as the 'T'. It was accompanied by a life-size self-portrait and his tag 'combo'. Four youths reportedly asked him to remove it and then attacked him when he refused, it was reported by Le Monde. The attack has highlighted the religious tensions in the French capital that have flared up since last month's massacre at the Charlie Hebdo newspaper by Islamist extremists. Combo, also known as the Culture Kidnapper, revealed details of the assault on his Facebook page. 'They were tired that I wasn't giving, so they left me bleeding and fled,' he wrote. 'They promised me the same treatment if I did it again and told me to shave off my beard.' He declined to discuss the identity of his attackers, saying 'it would only add fuel to the fire', adding: 'I won't forgive them for what they did of course, but I won't seek revenge either. 'I filed a complaint with the police and I trust the French judicial system to do its job.' When asked whether Paris had changed since the Islamist attacks, Combo said: 'It is different, clearly. 'The way people look at me especially. Not because of my origins I believe, but because of my beard. Calling for peace: The design featured the word 'coexist' written with a Muslim crescent for the letter C, a Star of David as the X and a Christian cross as the 'T'. It was accompanied by a life-size self-portrait . 'That being said, I'm not being paranoid and I'm very confident about the future. I'm forbidding myself to be pessimistic. 'The atmosphere is heavier than usual, but I only see it as temporary thing. It doesn't drastically change the way I work. 'We always had racism issues in France, especially towards Arabs. And the perception one may have, particularly from abroad, is clearly something that is fuelled by the media.' The graffiti artist organised a campaign on Sunday in which participants pasted posters of the same mural he was beaten up for painting all across Paris. Twelve people died when gunmen Said and Cherif Kouachi attacked the offices of Charlie Hebdo. A policewoman was shot dead the next morning. Then there were four more fatalities in a Kosher store before three Al Qaeda and Islamic State-linked terrorists were themselves gunned down. All three Paris terrorists were born and brought up on Paris sink estates, and had started out as street criminals. Combo was beaten up for posting this mural but copies of it have now been pasted up across Paris . A coexist poster outside a Paris metro station.

"This is the terrifying moment that a rocket attack was launched on a residential area of Ukraine leaving at least six civilians dead. More than 20 explosions were seen striking homes and buildings during the two minute attack on Kramatorsk, a town about 30 miles from the front lines. Ukraine's military headquarters in the east of the country, from where Kiev military directs its campaign against pro-Russian separatists, were also hit. Local officials said at least six people were killed in the bombardment that left a further 21 injured. Scroll down for video . At least six civilians were killed after rockets hit the residential town of Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine . More than 20 strikes were carried out in Kramatorsk in a matter of minutes during the rebel attack . Photos from the scene, showing an artillery shell stuck in the ground next to a residential building and two bodies lying nearby. In the two minute long video clip the woman filming can be heard repeatedly screaming 'boys,' Vocativ reported. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko told parliament that Russian-backed rebels launched an artillery strike on the town. He said: 'Twenty-five minutes ago, the main headquarters of our anti-terrorist operation took a strike from a Tornado rocket. The headquarters took this strike, but a second strike was carried out on residential areas of Kramatorsk. Relatives crying over the body of a victim of the shelling in the residential area of  Kramotorsk, Ukraine . Death: More than 20 explosions were seen striking homes and buildings during the attack on Kramatorsk . Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko told parliament that Russian-backed rebels launched the artillery strike on the town . Kramatorsk was the site of major fighting until July when pro-Russian separatists retreated . In the two minute long video clip the woman filming can be heard repeatedly screaming 'boys,' 'There is information about wounded service personnel. There is information about a significant number of wounded among civilians,' he added. The government-controlled Donetsk regional administration said the rockets had been fired from the rebel-controlled Horlivka area, which is about 50 km away from Kramatorsk. Kramatorsk was the site of major fighting until July when pro-Russian separatists retreated. The fighting, which the UN says has killed more than 5,300 people since April, comes ahead of a crucial summit involving Western leaders tomorrow, as well as peace talks later today. The volunteer Azov battalion, loyal to Kiev, said on social media that it had captured several villages north east of the strategic port of Mariupol, pushing the rebels closer to the border with Russia. However, rebel military spokesman Eduard Basurin said in a televised news conference the rebels had not retreated. A rocket shell in the street in the town of Kramatorsk . The Azov said rebels shelled the village of Kominternove, east of Mariupol, causing unspecified civilian casualties. The rebels also reported advances. Mr Basurin said they had surrounded the railway hub of Debaltseve, the focus of fierce fighting in past weeks, cutting it off from a major road. A video posted online by a rebel-sympathisng website showed separatists moving along the route while the bloodied bodies of Ukrainian soldiers lay on the side of the road. At least seven Ukrainian troops were killed overnight in the east, military spokesman Anatoliy Matyukhin said. In the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, which comes under constant shelling, two civilians were killed and 12 injured. The fierce fighting and a mounting death toll comes amid renewed efforts to work out a peaceful solution in a conflict that has displaced at least a million people and left the powerhouse of the Ukrainian economy in ruins. Representatives of Ukraine, Russia, rebels and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe are meeting for long-anticipated talks later today in Minsk to lay the groundwork for a meeting tomorrow between the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France. The Kremlin today warned the West ahead of the talks against sending weapons to Ukraine or putting pressure on Russia. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told the Russian News Service radio station that any talk about imposing new sanctions on Russia or arming the Ukraine government would destabilise the situation. In Washington yesterday, President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel rallied behind efforts to reach a long-shot diplomatic resolution to the conflict, but they offered no clear path for how the West would proceed if talks this week fail. Ms Merkel staunchly opposed arming Ukraine's beleaguered military while Mr Obama dangled the prospect that the US could for the first time send weapons to Ukraine.","Six civilians killed in rocket attack on Kramatorsk, eastern Ukraine .

"For most people getting a parking fine would be enough to ruin their day. But England captain Wayne Rooney could not stop smiling after  a traffic warden left a yellow ticket on his £100,000 silver Range Rover outside his favourite Chinese restaurant in Manchester. Rather than deal with it himself he then handed the ticket to his long-serving agent Paul Stretford, who looked a little less pleased. Just the ticket: Wayne Rooney was unperturbed after getting a parking ticket in Manchester and smiled as he handed it to his agent Paul Stretford . Small change: Rooney earns enough in two minutes to pay the £60 fine thanks to his £300,000-a-week deal with Manchester United . Rooney is unlikely to be perturbed by the £60 ticket because it only takes him two minutes to earn the amount thanks to the  £300,000-a-week deal he signed with Manchester United last year. The striker was filming a promotional campaign at Wing's Chinese Restaurant accompanied by his manager and brother-in-law Joe McLoughlin, his wife Coleen's younger sibling. The 29-year-old star posed with a dragon mascot in the venue's dining area and posted the picture on his official Facebook account with the caption: 'Had a good day filming yesterday at my friend Wing's restaurant and learning about Chinese New Year.' Wing's is known to be a favourite for Rooney, who held his birthday celebrations there last October, dining out with his family and Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart. Favourite spot: Rooney leaves Wing's Restaurant with agent Paul Stretford and brother-in-law Joe McLoughlin . Wing's Restaurant is a popular haunt for Rooney and he held his birthday celebrations there last year with his family and other footballers .

"Tony Abbott's deputy has publicly urged him to respond to concerns about his powerful chief of staff, Peta Credlin. Deputy Liberal leader Julie Bishop said government MPs had offered the prime minister 'very frank and blunt' assessments of how his office was run. 'The prime minister must respond to their concerns if they are valid concerns,' Ms Bishop told the ABC on Tuesday. Deputy Liberal leader Julie Bishop has called on Prime Minister Tony Abbott to address concerns about his chief of staff . 'The prime minister is a smart man. He will take this into account.' Ms Bishop reportedly has a strained relationship with Ms Credlin who has angered many government MPs by centralising control and vetoing staffing decisions. The foreign affairs minister described Ms Credlin as a very powerful figure with 'a lot of opinions'. But she stopped short of joining backbench MPs who want the prime minister to dump her. 'His particular staffing arrangements are a matter for him,' she said. Mr Abbott has vowed things will change in his office after he fended off a party room push for a leadership spill on Monday. It has been reported Ms Bishop does not get along with Peta Credlin (pictured above) who has angered many MPs by centralising control and vetoing staffing decisions . The prime minister held onto his leadership after 61 MPs voted against a spill motion and 39 for it. Mr Abbott is facing a joint party room meeting on Tuesday in which the concerns about his office are likely to get another airing. His restive backbench is also expected to grill Mr Abbott and his senior ministers on a number of policy issues, such as the future of the unpopular GP co-payment. Treasurer Joe Hockey is set to face some tough questions as he begins preparing his second budget, amid ongoing unhappiness with his performance. But Ms Bishop rejected reports Mr Abbott may dump Mr Hockey from the job. 'Joe's continuing as treasurer,' she said. Ms Bishop's comments come after a leadership spill on Monday, which saw him remain as prime minister . Social Services Minister Scott Morrison also backed Mr Hockey staying in the job, despite being touted as the man most likely to replace him. Asked whether Ms Credlin should resign, Mr Morrison said: 'That's a matter for Tony Abbott.' Former assistant treasurer Arthur Sinodinos, who backed the unsuccessful leadership spill on Monday, said Tuesday's meeting would be a 'new paradigm' for the government. 'I suspect you'll find a lot of MPs on their feet raising issues,' he told ABC radio. 'I think there's a new assertiveness on the backbench.' Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said the party had now put its internal issues behind it. 'There absolutely won't be any recriminations,' he said of Monday's spill motion. 'We have to pull together.' One of the backbenchers who pushed for the spill said the party was now getting behind the prime minister. 'Unfortunately it required something like this for the prime minister to realise there were very significant problems both in style and substance that needed to be addressed,' West Australian MP Dennis Jensen said.","Julie Bishop has called on Tony Abbott to respond to MPs' concerns .

"Tributes were paid by friends and family today to a late teenager who ‘touched thousands of lives’. More than 600 people gathered to pay their respects to ‘strong’ and ‘brave’ charity fundraiser Jak Trueman, 15, days after he lost his fight with a rare form of cancer. Among the mourners was his girlfriend Hannah Boyd, 14, and memories were shared during a touching ceremony at the Kirk of Calder Church in his home village of Mid Calder, West Lothian. Emotional day: Among the mourners at Jak Trueman's funeral at the Kirk of Calder Church in Mid Calder, West Lothian, were his girlfriend Hannah Boyd (left) and mother Allison (right, with Rev Nanda Groenewald) Mourning: Jak's Glasgow Rangers-themed coffin was carried into the church as his friends and classmates from West Calder High School and team mates of his football club Mid Calder Colts watched . Many of the attendees were dressed in Glasgow Rangers football colours on the request of Jak's family, while more than 300 people stood outside listening to the service on speakers. Jak's Rangers-themed coffin was carried into the church as his friends and classmates from West Calder High School and team mates of his football club Mid Calder Colts watched. Mark Traynor, 44, an instrumental music instructor who taught Jak the tuba since he was nine years old, led the service. He said: ‘I'm really proud to have taught the young lad. It's a sad day and he will be missed. He was a big likeable soul who always had a smile on his face. ‘The family want to make sure the legacy he left continues. Jak was very keen that what comes out of this tragedy, others are helped along the way. ‘I really think that he will be well known in this community for many years to come. My lasting memories of Jak are that we shared some good banter. It was a real pleasure to have known him.’ Happy memories: More than 200 pupils and teachers at West Calder High School watched Jak fulfil a vow to take his girlfriend Hannah to the prom last week (left). The couple are also pictured together (right). Couple: Jak was happiest 'when he was spending time with us and his beautiful Hannah', his mother said . The entrance hymn 'Our God is a Great Big God' preceded a prayer from Rev Nanda Groenewald. Current Hearts and former Rangers goalkeeper Neil Alexander also paid tribute to Jak with a poem. He said: ‘I truly feel blessed that I got to meet Jak and be able to call him my pal. I am extremely privileged to be asked to be the patron of his charity. ‘I'm sure he is looking down with that smile we all knew and loved at the support here today. It just shows how many people loved and cared for such a special person.’ Mourners at the touching service heard readings by the teenager's GP, Ian MacLeod, and a version of the song 'A Drop in the Ocean' by Jak's sister Aimie. Through tears, his mother Allison described him as an inspirational character who ‘touched thousands of lives on so many levels’. She said: ‘This is every mother's absolute nightmare come true and the very last place I thought I'd ever be standing. 'Blessed': Current Hearts goalkeeper Neil Alexander (with wife Joanne) also paid tribute to Jak with a poem . Flowers: Many of the attendees were dressed in Glasgow Rangers football colours on the request of Jak's family, while more than 300 people stood outside listening to the service on speakers . ‘But we are here and there is absolutely nothing we can do about it except honour my amazing, strong, brave, handsome, intelligent, loving, talented inspirational boy - my son Jak. ‘Proud is an understatement of how I feel about my precious son. Since he was born I have loved him unconditionally. ‘Jak's family and friends meant the world to him and he was never happier than when he was spending time with us and his beautiful Hannah. ‘I remember about six months when they had started going out, he came into the kitchen one day and said “mum, I just love that girl”. ‘If there is any purpose to this tragedy, it's got to be that my amazing son has touched thousands of lives on so many levels. ‘Our family members will never be the same again, in a good way, as he has brought us so much closer together than we already were. He has inspired us to see the good in every situation.’ In blue: Six months after the couple had started going out, Jak told his mother of Hannah 'I just love that girl' End of the service: Family members, friends and colleagues embraced and applauded after the ceremony . She added: ‘Most of all, he has left a little bit of heaven here on earth. In hospital: Jak, of West Lothian, died last Monday . ‘Strangely enough, as much as my heart is broken and my body aches for him, I am actually finding myself beaming with pride at the amazing, wonderful, loving inspirational son I had. Even though his life has been short, it has been fantastic.’ As the service closed, Jak's coffin was carried out the church to the tune of 'Simply the Best' by Tina Turner. Family members, friends and colleagues embraced and applauded. Jak was diagnosed with a very rare form of blood cancer - known as Gammadelta T-cell lymphoma - in August. He had been set for a bone marrow transplant three weeks ago, but learned that the disease had spread to his bones and organs. He spent his last days fulfilling as many of his wishes as he could and trying to raise as much money as possible for charity. More than 200 pupils and teachers at West Calder High School watched him fulfil a vow to take his girlfriend Hannah to the prom a fortnight ago. Hedied last Monday. Collections at the funeral service were given to a charity set up by Jak's family, dubbed Team Jak, in a bid to fight cancer. A fundraising page for leukaemia and lymphoma research set up during his final days has since raised more than £55,000 - well over double the original target.Jak was laid to rest at St Drostan's Cemetery in Markinch.","More than 600 people gather to pay their respects to Jak Trueman, 15, .

The Chancellor was speaking after Prime Minister David Cameron met officials from the Treasury and Bank of England for a meeting at Downing Street to discuss measures to protect Britain from the consequences of a possible Greek debt default or exit from the euro. Speaking at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Istanbul which has been dominated by the situation in Greece, Mr Osborne acknowledged that a crisis in the eurozone would spill over to affect the UK and warned of the dangers of a 'chaotic and disorderly exit'. 'There's no doubt that the UK economy would be affected by a crisis in the eurozone. We know that from recent experience,' he told Bloomberg Business TV.' He added: 'That's why we need to take steps to protect ourselves at home. And that why it's right that we step up our contingency planning. It's why I see it is vital that we go on working through our economic plan so that we are taking steps to secure and strengthen our economy.' Greece's new prime minister, Alexis Tsipras (left) - elected last month on an anti-austerity platform - is facing a showdown with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel over writing off Greece's debts . Greek troops march to the front in 1941 following the Nazi invasion that year . Germany has rejected Greece's demands for £120bn in reparations for Second World War damages – adding there is ‘zero’ chance they will pay. New Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, in his first major speech to parliament, said his country had a 'moral obligation' to claim repayment for a forced wartime loan and other reparations. Mr Tsipras's anti-austerity Syriza party claims Germany owes it around £120bn, or around half the country's public debt, which stands at over £235bn. Greece had 'a moral obligation to our people, to history, to all European peoples who fought and gave their blood against Nazism,' Mr Tsipras said to parliament. But Germany's economy minister rejected the call, insisting the matter was concluded with a signed treaty 25 years ago. 'But the idea that Britain or indeed the rest of the world is entirely insulated from what happens in the eurozone is sadly not true.' Greece's new prime minister, Alexis Tsipras - elected last month on an anti-austerity platform - insisted last night that he was confident of reaching a deal on the £240 billion national debts which his Syriza party blames for six years of deep recession. Following talks with Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann in Vienna as part of his whirlwind tour of eurozone capitals, Mr Tsipras said that only 'political reasons' could block a deal with Greece's creditors, adding: 'I think that would be a decision to torpedo our common European future. And I think nobody harbours such intentions.' But Greece has suffered a ratings downgrade, tumbling share prices and hikes in bond interest since Syriza came to power, while the European Central Bank has said it will no longer accept its bonds as collateral for credit. It remains unclear whether compromise can be reached at an emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels tomorrow. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she is waiting to see whether Athens puts 'a sustainable proposal' on the table. Mr Osborne said: 'It's clear to the world economy that this stand-off with the eurozone and Greece is growing each day and I think the risks of a miscalculation or a misstep leading to a very bad outcome is growing as well. 'And so, here at the G20, we are urging all parties to this dispute to try and find some common solutions and we are also at home stepping up our preparations for whatever the outcome may be. 'We have to make sure that the British people are best protected from whatever develops in this crisis, because I am clear that the Greek exit from the euro would be very difficult for the world economy and potentially very damaging for the European economy. 'We have to be prepared for that outcome. So we have to make sure that we choose a path of competence and stability over potentially a chaotic and disorderly exit.'","Chancellor said there was an increasing risk the stand-off will end badly .

The 10km course will be action-packed, suitable for endurance race veterans or competitors who are looking for a challenge. 'You will encounter hills, woods, streams, hedges and hay barns as you seek the finish line in a bid to beat your team mate.'

'This is an opportunity to join Nicky for an early morning 5km run. After your run, join Nicky for a hearty breakfast.' The chance to hit the shops with Mrs May was one of the most highly-prized lots. The glossy brochure stated: 'Merge fashion and politics with the longest serving Home Secretary for 50 years.

"One in three rioters who brought terror and destruction to the streets of London went on to commit crimes including murder, rape and robbery, figures revealed yesterday. Some 1,593 of the 3,914 thugs charged or cautioned following the disturbances of August 2011 have reoffended. Among the near-6,000 fresh crimes they notched up in the three years since the riots were 12 killings, 180 serious assaults such as wounding and 151 crimes involving a weapon. Scroll down for video . Riot: Of the 3,914 people charged or cautioned by Met Police in the wake of the London riots in August 2011 (pictured), at least 1,593 have re-offended. The offences include murder, rape, GBH, drug charges and theft . Trouble: Rioters plunged much of Britain into chaos over  in August 2011, looting shops and torching buildings . But although some rioters are still in jail for offences committed during the lawlessness, the vast majority have either been freed or given non-custodial sentences. The statistics sparked fresh calls for the authorities to get a better ‘grip’ on young men entrenched in a life of violent crime and warnings that failing to keep career criminals under control is putting people in danger. The figures are also likely to be echoed in other cities struck by rioting that spread from the capital, including Bristol, Birmingham and Manchester. A breakdown of figures released under the Freedom of Information Act reveal a total of 5,878 new crimes committed by the London rioters. Of these, 1,172 were violent offences – including 314 ‘assault with injury’ crimes, 171 common assaults and 265 cases of harassment. Along with 21 rapes, there were also 719 burglaries, 451 robberies and 1,075 thefts. Some 1,819 drug offences included 221 trafficking charges, and there were 36 frauds and 213 cases of vandalism. Incredibly, one rioter went on to commit 72 new crimes. The data also reveals how 168 of the 1,593 reoffenders in London belonged to gangs. Some 107 people – 17 of them gangsters – committed ten or more new offences. SELFIES and online messaging are creating a generation of youngsters who are ‘kinder’ and less likely to commit crime, Boris Johnson has claimed. The London Mayor said concerns that smartphones and handheld games consoles were turning children into ‘lidless lizards’ could be ‘more or less entirely dismissed’. He argued that gadgets gave the young ‘endless opportunities’ for self-expression and communication that kept them from being ‘sucked into crime’. In a speech on technology in Boston during a whirlwind tour of the US, Mr Johnson said: ‘I would say that on the whole the younger generation are nicer, kinder, more well-balanced and more emotionally literate than my lot ever were.’ He said while young men are typically drawn into crime because of ‘anger, low self-esteem and a sense of social exclusion’, selfies, texts and shared videos provided by handheld gizmos offer ‘myriad pipette drops of self-affirmation’. He referred to technology as a ‘liberator’ that gives voters the right to vent their feelings every day, adding: ‘I see no evidence whatever that tech is coarsening or depraving the young people of today.’ A total of 261 rioters, including 49 gang members, carried out between five and ten more crimes. London’s Deputy Mayor Stephen Greenhalgh, said urgent changes were needed to protect the public by keeping a better ‘grip’ on offenders. He called for New York-style reforms that would put City Hall in overall control of the capital’s entire criminal justice system. He said the figures proved that the riots in 2011 were fuelled by ‘prolific offenders rather than low-level opportunists’. ‘Even though the police have learnt the lessons of the riots, the wider criminal justice system needs to up its game and stop playing pass the parcel with these violent criminals,’ he warned. ‘We need to grip these offenders. Many have not been deterred, despite prosecuting them more quickly in 2011, and have gone on to rape and murder in some cases.’ The Metropolitan Police said it is working hard to reduce reoffending, but the responsibility for monitoring freed criminals fell mainly to other agencies. Rioters plunged much of Britain into chaos over several days in August 2011, looting shops, torching buildings and terrorising neighbourhoods. The unrest began in the capital and was sparked by the killing of Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by police in Tottenham, north London, on August 4. However, the rioting quickly spread to other parts of London and Britain, with Birmingham, Bristol and Manchester all hit by 'copycat violence' over the subsequent days. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'Re-offending has been too high for too long and we are introducing wide-reaching reforms to the way offenders are managed to tackle this unacceptable issue. 'This year, for the first time, all prisoners will receive at least 12 months rehabilitation on release to tackle their criminal behaviour. 'This includes those on short sentences who have the highest re-offending rates and up until now have received no statutory post-prison support. 'This will be vital in cutting crime and making our communities safer.' The figures, released by Scotland Yard, show that the offences were committed between the aftermath of the riots and the end of last year. The re-offenders included 168 gang members, the police figures revealed .","Of the 3,914 people charged over London riots, 1,593 have now re-offended .

"A group of more than 100 members of Princeton’s class of 1978 have penned an open letter condemning their fellow alumna Susan Patton, better known as the Princeton Mom, for her recent comments about campus rape. Patton, a 1977 graduate of the prestigious Ivy League college who was the president of her class, was catapulted to fame last year when she wrote a column offering female college students advice on how to find a husband. The controversy stirred by the op-ed resulted in a book deal for the outspoken Mrs Patton, who last March released her self-help bestseller titled Marry Smart: Advice for Finding The One. Scroll down for videos . Under fire: A group of 123 members of Princeton's class of 1978 have written an open letter condemning Susan 'Princeton Mom' Patton for her comments on date rape . Outraged: Susan Patton (left), known as Princeton Mom, said in an interview with Elisabeth Hasselbeck (right) that she believes many reported rapes are just the result of 'bad manners' But the self-proclaimed Princeton Mom, whose two sons also attended her alma mater, did not stop at dolling out tips on making a good match. In December, Patton dived head-first into the University of Virginia rape scandal, claiming that sexual assault could be a 'learning experience' for female students. During an interview on CNN, Patton described rape as a ‘clumsy hook-up melodrama' and criticized women who find themselves in a precarious situation for not telling the man they're with to stop and leave. Mom's pearls of wisdom: Patton, a 1977 graduate of the prestigious Ivy League college, was catapulted to fame last year when she wrote a letter offering female college students advice on how to find a husband . Patton sounded a similar note a month later in her appearance on Fox & Friends, during which she once again weighed in on sexual abuse. At her appearance, Patton came out strongly against teaching children about rape and molestation in schools, saying that sexual assault often can be chalked up to 'bad manners.' These recent pronouncements on the subject by Susan Patton have led a group of 123 Princeton alumni to speak out against her this week in a letter published in The Daily Princetonian, the university's student newspaper. ‘We believe we speak for the great majority of Princeton moms and dads, as well as alumni who do not have children, in saying rape in general — and date rape in particular — is inexcusable, rape survivors deserve our help and support and anyone who sexually assaults another person should be prosecuted legally,’ the open letter read in part. The alumni behind the strongly worded missive went on to accuse Patton of shaming victims of rape by placing the blame squarely on them. ‘Rape and sexual assault are violent crimes against persons of any gender,’ the letter stated. ‘It is particularly disturbing when college students violate the trust of people they know.’ The group of alumni brought up another letter, penned by Patton herself to the Daily Princetonian in March 2014, in which she compared a woman who gets raped to someone who doesn't look both ways before crossing the street and gets hit by a car. In response to her controversial comments at the time, more than 200 faculty members signed an open letter to the student paper speaking out against Patton and expressing their support for victims of sexual abuse. Bestselling author: The controversy stirred by Patton resulted in a book deal for the outspoken Ivy League graduate (left), who last March released the self-help opus Marry Smart: Advice for Finding The One (right) ‘Yet the wider world continues to see this woman dressed in orange and black associating her out-of-touch personal beliefs with our alma mater,’ the 123 Princeton graduates stated this week. ‘We — along with many other alumni — see these views as outrageous and unworthy of being associated with Princeton.’ The alumni concluded their letter by calling on the Princeton administration to continue striving to create a climate where accusations of sexual abuse are taken seriously. Class of 1978 graduate Julie List, who spearheaded the open letter against Patton, said that unlike her previous relatively harmless remarks urging young women to lose weight and get regular manicures in order to land a good husband, her opinions on campus rape could prove ‘actively damaging.’ ‘With this, I strongly felt she was really, really undermining the young women who might have finally gotten the courage to come forward if they were raped by an acquaintance or on a date,’ Ms List told the Post. Speaking to the Washington Post, Susan Patton said some of her comments have been taken out of context. School colors: The alumni have accused Patton of going around dressed in Princeton's colors of orange and black and making herself out to be the voice of the university . ‘I have never said that rape is a learning experience. What I said is when women drink a little bit, get a little tipsy, have consensual sex with a man they know they shouldn’t have had sex with and wake up in the morning and think, “Oh my God, what did I do?” — that is not rape. It’s a learning experience,’ she said. Patton also has denied the alumni's claim that she has appointed herself a spokeswoman for the university by using the moniker Princeton Mom and wearing the Ivy League school’s colors. 'I'm speaking for myself,’ she insisted.","A group of 123 members of Princeton's class of 1978 published an open letter in the Daily Princetonian condemning Susan Patton .

"A Mormon man has taken a smiling selfie for every day he was on a lonely two-year missionary stint because it reminded him to be happy. Gabriel Guerrero, of Salt Lake City, Utah, said taking a selfie every day while on his Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints mission was not just a way of recording his experience, but it also kept him smiling when things got tough. Mr Guerrero served his mission for LDS in the Washington D.C. North Mission. Scroll down for video . Gabriel Guerrero (pictured) said taking a selfie every day while on his Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints mission was not only a great way to record his experience but kept him smiling when things got tough . He attended the missionary training center in Provo on December 12, 2012 and from day one took a picture of himself every morning. 'I saw a lot of people online doing selfie videos, but I didn't see any missionary ones,' Mr Guerrero told the Deseret News. 'The funny thing was that I initially was going to not smile as the others had done, but then as I was doing it, I thought to myself, ""This is a happy thing! I should be smiling!""' Mr Guerrero said that although he was initially concerned his companions would think he was behaving oddly, his daily photo became something the other missionaries looked forward to. Mr Guerrero served his mission for LDS in the Washington D.C. North Mission and sometimes felt lonely . He says taking a smiling picture everyday would remind him he was happy - even when things got tough . He would announce to the others that he was about to take his daily photo and they would each try to photobomb it. When he returned home on December 9, 2014, Mr Guerrero stitched all of the photos together to make a video. He posted the video on YouTube on January 26 and so far it has had more than 35,000 views. He now says he is glad he smiled in each of the photos, as it helped him through the tough times during the mission.

"Scotland Yard's four-year, £33million probe into journalists has descended into a nonsensical witch-hunt, according to a police and crime commissioner. Kevin Hurley said officers should focus on terrorism, violent crime and serious fraud – rather than on pursuing reporters suspected of paying officials for information, intercepting voicemail messages or hacking into computers. The former Met superintendent, who became commissioner for Surrey in November 2012, also called for greater protection for whistle-blowers and new laws to make it more difficult for police to seize details of phone calls made by journalists. Kevin Hurley said the £33m probe into journalists would put 600 extra officers on the street for a year or pay for 20 murder investigations . 'There are many murders, serial rapes and serious assaults that remain unsolved in this country, to say nothing of the fact that police forces around the country don't have sufficient resources to tackle terrorism,' he added. Describing the scale of the media investigations as 'utter nonsense', he insisted: 'Some journalists did step over the mark. 'But nobody's died – let's get a sense of proportionality. Let's have some wisdom in decision-making.' Mr Hurley said that £33million would put 600 extra officers on the streets for a year or pay for 20 murder investigations. 'I know of a London borough's CID office which has been cut by two thirds. What are we doing spending this much money investigating journalists? 'Where is the public-safety issue in that?' he added. 'We need to be spending our money on tackling terrorism, murderers, rapists and people who defraud our businesses, putting people out of work. 'This has gone far enough – it is time to focus on keeping the public safe.' In an interview with Press Gazette, he said: 'The point has been proven. What are we now going to achieve? 'What does it prove, how does it make us safer? We can't afford to put enough armed officers on to the streets to take on terrorists.' Scotland Yard's four-year, £33million probe into journalists - including former editor of the Sun Rebekah Brooks - has descended into a nonsensical witch-hunt, according to the police and crime commissioner . Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act have revealed that the Met had spent £33.5million up to the end of September 2014 investigating allegations against journalists. Last week a row broke out in court over a 'secret' decision to appoint a new judge to preside over the retrial of four Sun executives accused of bribing public officials for information. Judge Richard Marks QC, who oversaw the first trial of the men, had been expected to officiate when the case is heard again later this year. But at an Old Bailey hearing on Friday, it emerged that he had been mysteriously substituted by Judge Charles Wide. In a hearing lasting more than an hour, it was claimed that several more senior judges had intervened to put Judge Wide in charge. He is the only judge so far to have presided over a case that has seen a conviction of a journalist in relation to allegations of unlawful payments to public officials for stories.","Kevin Hurley said officers should focus on terrorism, crime and fraud .

"Bill and Hillary Clinton's charitable foundation reportedly received as much as $81million from clients with accounts with at HSBC's Swiss bank in Geneva. The contributions - including $1million in exchange for Bill attending a lavish fancy-dress party in Russia - come from wealthy clients who are protected by Switzerland's robust banking secrecy laws. Details of 30,000 accounts have come to light after an enormous banking leak - which brought with it the names of seven donors to the charitable Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Donor: Bill Clinton, center, received substantial contributions to his foundation from people with accounts at the secretive Swiss bank - such as Richard Caring, left, who paid $1million after Clinton dressed as a Russian general for a lavish fundraiser, pictured above . According to the Guardian, chief among the donors was Canadian mining magnate Frank Giustra, who reportedly handed over $50million to the presidential organisation. Michael Schumacher, the racing driver seriously injured in a 2013 skiing accident, was listed as another donor, as was billionaire Eli Broad and French financier Arpad Busson. Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who flew President Clinton round in his private jet, also gave tens of thousands of dollars, according to reports. The most colorful Clinton anecdote from the leaked files, however, involves Richard Caring, a regular political donor in Britain, who paid out $1million to get Clinton to a costume party in Russia. Caring is a British businessman who has large interests in fashion, property and fine dining, mostly in the United Kingdom. He is one of the richest men in the country. Caring, whose dealings with HSBC's Swiss bank involve a much-scrutinized $3.4million cash withdrawal, gave the Clintons' foundation the large donation following his attendance at a ball in St Petersburg's Winter Palace in November 2005. Clinton, dressed as a Russian general, was seen celebrating alongside Caring at the bash, which featured music by Tina Turner and Elton John. Friends: Sir Philip Green, Richard Caring, his wife Jackie Caring and Bill Clinton at the 2005 bash . Clinton addressed the lavish event, which was attended by some 450 VIP guests. The donation to his foundation followed a month later. The Guardian reports that HSBC’s notes contain an instruction to ‘transfer [$1m] to Bill Clinton’s Foundation as a contribution following his involvement in the charity function.’ Though Swiss accounts are often involved in tax-dodging scheme, there has been no evidence to suggest any of the Clinton foundation donors evaded tax. A statement from the foundation said that all donations are carefully vetted. The Clintons and individual donors declined comment to the Guardian. Caring did not comment on his Clinton donation. Speaking to the Daily Mail about the large cash withdrawal, he said: 'I appreciate it was a large amount of money but I was put in that position at the time because the people I was dealing with did not want to use HSBC in a particular transaction.

"Lindsey Vonn broke down in tears after being disqualified from a world championship run in front of her home crowd in Beaver Creek, Colorado. The four-time world champion - famous for her relationship to Tiger Woods - bravely smiled and waved to her adoring fans but her sadness spilled over when she was out of view. Vonn, 30, was the gold medal favourite in the Alpine combined race which contains elements of downhill and slalom skiing. But she crumbled under the intense pressure and recorded a 'did not finish' after straddling a gate in the slalom section - meaning her FIS Alpine World Cup run counted for nothing.

Brave face: Vonn (pictured) smiled and waved to the crowd as she finished the world championship run that did not count . Intense pressure: 30-year-old Vonn's sadness eventually spilled over and she could barely convey her disappointment in an emotional post-race interview . Barely able to speak, she said afterwards: 'It's the hometown championship and I really tried as hard as I could and I just - I came up short and that's disappointing for myself and for my family and for my fans. 'I just didn't figure out this hill at all and I was especially disappointed today because I actually skied a really good slalom the last few days and I thought I had a chance of getting a medal.' The professional skier posted a defiant picture on her Instagram account hours after her failed run. It features a picture of the winter athlete in tight, black sportswear alongside the caption: 'Even if you have setbacks and you have bad days, you have to believe in yourself that things are going to turn around.' Vonn was looking forward to this event in her backyard, where boyfriend Tiger Woods came as a spectator last week. She had to pull out of the Sochi Winter Olympics last year after suffering a potentially career-threatening knee injury in January 2014.

And Vonn  has struggled to find her rhythm on the difficult course because its very icy and she claims 'doesn't 'really feel good on my knee'. Her hometown race was eventually won by Slovenia's Tina Maze, who empathised with the pressure Vonn was under. She said: 'I know exactly what the feeling is like when things are not going the way you want to. 'It happened to me. It happened to everybody. When you're going through that, you need to trust in yourself.' Vonn has a final chance to claim a gold medal in front of her home fans on Thursday when she takes part in the giant slalom event. But she knows it will take a 'miracle', since it's not one of her stronger disciplines these days. She said: 'Just try to forget today as fast as possible and move on to the next race.'","Vonn disqualified in world championship run in front of her home crowd .

"When her weight began creeping up, and her trim size 10 frame ballooned to a fuller size 16, Kate Archibald was left confused. The university student began to pile on the pounds in her first year. While enjoying the student life, Miss Archibald said she couldn't account for her drastic weight gain. But after waking one morning to find her bed covered in dozens of food wrappers, it dawned on the 20-year-old - she had been gorging in her sleep. She has since been diagnosed with a medical condition called nocturnal sleep eating disorder - sleep walking while also carrying out a sufferer's conscious desires. Scroll down for video . Kate Archibald, 20, couldn't understand why she was putting on weight in her first year at the University of Aberdeen. After waking up one morning surrounded by food wrappers she realised she was sleep eating . The now third-year student had noticed her weight increasing as she went from a svelte size 10 to a fuller size 16 by the end of her first year . Now in her third year at the University of Aberdeen, Miss Archibald said: 'I had absolutely no idea why I was putting on weight. 'And I used to get in massive rows with my flatmates about all this food that was going missing - I was adamant I hadn't eaten anything. 'It was only when I woke up one morning surrounded by chocolate bar wrappers that I realised I must have been sleep-eating.' She said her local GP diagnosed the problem, which is listed on her ADHD medication as a potential side effect. Miss Archibald has since stopped taking the drugs as often in a bid to reduce the effect. The philosophy and world religion student told her student newspaper The Tab: 'I used to have to take Adderall for ADHD - one of the side effects is that it completely suppresses your appetite. 'When I was at boarding school, we had our tuck box at the bottom of our beds, and I would wake up when the medication wore off and feel ravenous, so I'd eat as much as I could. 'But when I got older, I stopped needing the medication as often, and because I didn't have any food in my uni room, I didn't think that I was waking up hungry any more. 'When the penny finally dropped that I was a sleep eater, I had stayed round a friend's house and in the morning there was a completely empty selection box - and the bed was filled with wrappers.' During her midnight feasts, Miss Archibald gorges on thousands of calories, eating fatty snacks, including crisps, chocolate bars and nuts - despite hating the taste of them. She said: 'I'm a bit allergic to peanuts - they make my face swell a bit - so I always avoid them. 'But there have been some mornings where I've woken up and my whole face had ballooned, so I must have eaten them in the night. 'One of my housemates had been given a big bar of Galaxy by her boyfriend as a treat - but I managed to eat it and wake up the next morning with my face covered in chocolate. Miss Archibald, pictured at her heaviest, has since been diagnosed with nocturnal sleep eating disorder . The condition is a form of sleep walking, where sufferers act out their conscious desires while they are asleep. Miss Archibald said as well as crisps, chocolate and nuts, she has also been known to eat half a wheel of cheddar cheese and four helpings of spaghetti bolognaise . 'We laugh about it now, but I still have to regularly go to the shop to replace my flatmates' food. 'The weirdest thing I've ever eaten in a night is a wheel of cheddar cheese.' As well as making her way through the snack cupboard, Miss Archibald has devoured four portions of spaghetti bolognaise and even makes toast. Also known as sleep-related eating disorder, sleep eating is a combination of parasomnia and an eating disorder. It has been described as a state of sleepwalking that includes behaviours connected to a person's conscious wishes or wants. This is according to Dr John Winkleman, assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. The condition is thought to be closely related to night eating syndrome (NES). Where it differs is in the fact those suffering NES are completely awake and aware of their binge-eating habits. Those suffering nocturnal sleep eating disorder are unaware of their actions. Dr Winkleman noted both disorders are fairly common, in around one to five per cent of adults, and are predominantly found in young adult women. They are chronic illnesses and cause weight gain, sleep disruption and shame over loss of control over food intake. She said: 'It isn't really seen as an eating disorder, apparently it's more of a parasomnia. 'Basically, my body is conditioned to be hungry in the night and want food - even if I don't. 'It's sleep-walking, rather than an actual eating disorder. 'I've started locking myself in my room now, with lots of healthy snacks - but I still manage to get out and raid the fridge. 'My flatmates think I'm mad, but I'm always apologetic so they don't mind too much. 'I try and combat all the food I eat by going to the gym as much as possible.' Her flatmates, Ellie Harding and Ashleigh Black, have to try and convince Miss Archibald to not eat their food, but feel they are fighting a losing battle. Miss Harding said: 'If there's anything that we don't want her to eat we have to tell her. 'We just have to hope that her subconscious is listening and that she doesn't eat our good food. 'The funny thing is that she's forever going to Tesco in the morning to replace what she's eaten of ours. 'The ultimate fear is that she'll cook something during one of her episodes. 'We don't want her burning the flat down.' Miss Archibald, who said she thinks she sleep eats about three nights a week, added: 'I've never actually been caught in the act, but most nights I sleep naked, so that's probably a blessing.'","Kate Archibald gained weight in her first year at the University of Aberdeen .

"The manager at the New Orleans hotel where Brian Williams was camped out during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 has poured cold water on the version of events that the NBC News anchor has been retelling in recent years. Currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in Iraq in 2003, a number of Williams' other seemingly  outlandish claims over the years are now coming under increased scrutiny. Serious questions have been raised about the credibility of his claim that he saw a body or bodies in the floodwaters of New Orleans' French Quarter, an area that experienced very little flooding. Scroll down for video . Brian Williams' recollections of his time in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina has had further scorn poured on it by the manager of the hotel where he stayed back in 2005 . Myra DeGersdorff, manager of the Ritz-Carlton in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, has rubbished Williams' claims that his life was in danger and that the hotel was 'overrun' by gangs . Now the manager of the five-star Ritz-Carlton where Williams was staying at the time has spoken out to rubbish claims repeatedly made by Williams in the years since. 'Maybe he misremembered,' Myra DeGersdorff told The Washington Post. 'I'm not going to judge him, because it was such an unpleasant week and there were times to be concerned. … And when there is that kind of concern you can misremember. 'And maybe he was out there, and it wasn't impossible he could have encountered a body, but I don't think it was in the French Quarter. The French Quarter only got inches of flooding.' DeGersdorff recollections – backed up by numerous other New Orleans residents – contrast sharply with Williams' story. 'When you look out of your hotel room window in the French Quarter and watch a man float by face down, when you see bodies that you last saw in Banda Aceh, Indonesia and swore to yourself that you would never see in your country...I beat that storm. I was there before it arrived. Williams' reporting from New Orleans received countless plaudits and helped earn NBC a Peabody Award but is now being reevaluated with some skepticism following his Iraq war story climb down . 'I rode it out with people who later died in the Superdome,' he said in an interview in 2006, just a year after the hurricane. DeGersdorff, who was awarded the Ritz-Carlton President's Award for her handling of the hurricane, also denies claims that Williams repeated in an interview with Tom Brokaw last year in which he claimed gangs had 'overrun' the hotel. 'There absolutely was looting in the French Quarter,' DeGersdorff recalled. 'But I wouldn't say they were gangs. … They were primarily individual looters or two or three buddies attempting to break into camera stores; it was unpleasant.' She said 'on more than one occasion,' the looters tried to get inside. At one point, they did 'breach a door,' but were 'immediately' chased out. There were 'maybe one or two of them,' she said. Williams also told his version of events to historian Douglas Brinkley for his 2007 book, The Great Deluge. Currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in Iraq, a number of Williams' other seemingly outlandish claims are currently coming under increased scrutiny . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies. In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone ‘stuck a .38-caliber in my face.’ Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an army Chinook during the Iraq War in 2003. Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on air apology. ‘Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor,’ he wrote on Facebook. Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the floodwaters and that his hotel was ‘overrun’ with gangs, have been called into question by others who were there. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled ‘Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in.’ In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described a helicopter under fire a distance away. Boston, 2006 . A navy vet has accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the armed forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update. Williams' claim that he caught dysentery from drinking floodwaters while reporting on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005 has also been rubbished . According to Brinkley, Williams told him that 'armed gangs had broken into the 527-room hotel, brandishing guns and terrorizing guests. 'Williams, in fact, had seen his first corpse floating down Canal Street from his eighth-floor window earlier that day. Then fever consumed him.' DeGersdorff also questions Williams' claim about suffering dysentery and recalls that the anchor turned down the offer of medication that she had stockpiled in advance of the storm. 'He may have simply misremembered. But I can tell you no one broke out in the hotel with dysentery,' she said. Katrina occurred just months after Williams replaced Tom Brokaw as NBC News' anchor and his reporting from the devastation received countless plaudits and helped earn NBC a Peabody Award. In their face-to-face interview last year Brokaw had praised his replacement, saying that with his reporting during Katrina that Williams 'took ownership, if you will, of the anchor chair'.

"A crumpled set of orders for the Normandy invasion have been found under the floorboards of a New Forest hotel. Staff were astonished to find the documents - some marked 'On His Majesty's Service' - more than 70 years after the Balmer Lawn Hotel in Hampshire was used as an army staff college. The typed notes gave military orders and even detailed the woes of rigging up a ten-mile phone cable for advancing troops on 'D-Day 1' - June 7, 1944, the day after D-Day. On His Majesty's Service: These crumpled D-Day orders were discovered under a hotel's floorboards . Important: The documents, which were accompanied by cigarette boxes, detailed the woes of rigging up a ten-mile phone cable for advancing troops on 'D-Day 1' - June 7, 1944, the day after D-Day . Hotel staff said 'half a bin bag' worth of typed documents and envelopes were found by workers who were refurbishing the luxury four-star hotel. Most are thought to relate to the Canadian military, who were based at Balmer Lawn during the war. The hotel's owner Chris Wilson said: 'We've found spent ammunition under floorboards before, but never this quantity of documents. It ties the hotel to its history. 'They are quite detailed and specific orders to be followed by troops on the ground.' 'They're in a delicate condition and unscrunching them will have to be done very carefully. After that I imagine we'll put them on display.' The 'stash' found in the middle of a bedroom floor last week also included cigarette boxes and toothpaste tubes. Among the paperwork were more innocuous items, including an invitation to troops to 'attend the American All variety Musical-Variety Show, Swingin' in the ETO (European Theatre of Operations)'. Modern day: Renovators made the find at the Balmer Lawn Hotel in the New Forest (pictured) History: The hotel (pictured during the Second World War) was turned into an army staff college in the 1940s . Grim: Allied troops landing on the beaches . Canadian troops were instrumental to the invasion of June 6, 1944 - as their role was to take Juno Beach, one of five along a 50-mile stretch of the northern French coast. The country sent around 14,000 soldiers, 350 of whom died on that first day, and another 450 to be parachuted in behind enemy lines. The allied invasion, a key turning point in the Second World War, was notable for its co-operation between Britain, Canada and the U.S. Soldiers from all three countries underwent months of training. The documents, which were dusty, dirty and in bad shape but still readable, even survived a fire which engulfed much of the hotel in the 1970s. 'We are still in the process of evaluating the papers but some seem to include code on while others are more to do with the day-to-day organisation of the soldiers,' said a hotel spokesman. 'One includes an invite to all personnel to attend a musical variety show. 'Perhaps of most interest are the documents that refer to the D-Day landings. 'One document refers to D-Day 1 - June 7 1944 - and mentions difficulties in setting up a ten-mile telephone cable as troops continued advancing into northern France.' The hotel was built as a private house and hunting lodge in 1800 and extended in 1850. During the First World War it was used as a field hospital, with injured soldiers wheeled onto the wards on luggage trolleys from Brockenhurst station a mile away. During the 1940s it transformed into an army staff college, from which some of the orders for the D-Day landings were issued ahead of time. Dignitaries who visited the hotel during the two wars included King George V, Winston Churchill and General Eisenhower.","Builders found crumpled papers at Balmer Lawn Hotel in New Forest .

"Ministers' decision to cancel direct flights to the UK from West African countries affected by the Ebola outbreak has been sharply criticised by MPs, who said it had 'no basis in science'. The Commons Public Accounts Committee said the suspension of direct flights in the face of what it said was 'scaremongering' increased the cost of dealing with the disease and may have led to further loss of life. Direct flights from the region – including a British Airways route from Liberia to Heathrow with a stopover in Sierra Leone – were halted in August amid concerns passengers could bring the disease into the UK. Commons Public Accounts Committee labelled the flights suspension as 'scaremongering' and say it may have led to further loss of life . In October, Gambia Bird airlines was given permission to resume flights from Sierra Leone to Gatwick, only for them to be swiftly suspended again. Aid agencies have complained the restrictions hamper efforts to get assistance to the stricken region and the committee said they should now be lifted. The committee said: 'The revocation of licences to carriers to fly direct to the region was a political decision with no basis in science and was inconsistent with World Health Organisation advice. 'In our judgment, it will inevitably have led to an increase in the costs of dealing with the outbreak and, potentially, to further loss of life.' In October, Gambia Bird airlines (pictured) was given permission to resume flights from Sierra Leone to Gatwick, only for them to be swiftly suspended again . The committee echoed the findings of previous reports on the crisis that the response of the WHO and the international community to the outbreak was 'totally inadequate'. While it praised the 'bravery' of British volunteers and members of the armed forces who were now working in Sierra Leone, it said the Department for International Development had been 'far too slow' to react the developing situation. 'The department could and should have listened to and responded to the views of Medecins Sans Frontieres and others on the ground who were warning of the seriousness of the outbreak rather than relying on it simply to follow the trajectory of previous outbreaks, which there was every indication it would not do,' it said. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: 'Britain's decision to shoulder responsibility for tackling the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone has saved lives, not cost lives. 'Everyone agrees that the World Health Organisation should have reacted faster and the global system must reform to improve collective detection and reaction.'

"Even grizzly bears let the catch of the day slip through their claws every now and again. These spectacular photographs capture the moment a huge brown bear struggled to get his paws on some fast food as he hunted salmon. The hungry grizzlies showed off their fishing skills just inches from the camera after descending on the river in Ni'iinlii'njik Territorial Park in Yukon, Canada. Photojournalist, Peter Mather, had set up his equipment level with the waterline to capture the salmon desperate attempts to swimming away whilst the bear, above water, eyes it up. One underwater shot even shows a fish moments before a bear feasts on it. Catch of the day: This huge grizzly bear was captured on camera salmon hunting in Ni'iinlii'njik Territorial Park in Yukon, Canada . What a whooper: The brown bear sinks its teeth into a large salmon after pouncing on the fish . The one that got away: Fishing is even a slippery business for bears as this beast appears to lose his lunch . Mr Mather spent ten days at Bear Cave Mountain camp in the park so he could get up close and personal with the bears to take pictures of them. The 39-year-old, who lives in Yukon, was lead by guide Phil Timpany whilst on the trip. 'Fifteen hundred miles upriver from the Pacific Ocean and sitting dead centre on the arctic circle is the most unusual of ecological reserves,' he said. 'Surrounded by tundra and stunted black spruce forest you'll find the Fishing Branch Territorial Park. 'It's an arctic oasis where trees grow three or four times higher than the surrounding ecosystems and where grizzly bears and salmon play out a life-cycle thousands of years old. 'I spent 10 days at Bear Cave Mountain Eco-Adventures camp with guide Phil Timpany. 'To get to the lodge and park, I had to drive 500 kilometres north of Whitehorse to Dawson City, Yukon. 'From there it was a two hour helicopter ride North to the Lodge which is located on the Arctic Circle. It is one of the remotest locations in North America. 'To get the close-ups that I got I used a remote camera set up in an underwater housing. 'In the morning, I'd go down to the river with Phil and set my camera. Many of the bears were exceptional fishermen. The salmon were captured on camera desperately trying to swim away from the predators as he stalks the water . Hungry hunter: The grizzly bear wades through the freezing river water to get his claws on the salmon . The bear is captured charging into the water where he would aim to catch half a dozen fish . When one came near the camera, I'd be about 25 feet away at a viewing platform, and I'd use my remote to take pictures. 'Some of the bears were great at catching fish, and some had little luck. 'Some would charge into the river fast and pounce on them. One bear would snorkel through the deep water and catch them and others would walk the shoreline above the river and jump down on the fish. 'Normally, the bears would come down to the river for an hour and catch half a dozen fish, then they would go into the forest to nap for three hours and return to fish when they woke up. 'It was a once in a lifetime experience to be so close to these giant bears. We would be on viewing platforms not 10 feet away, and the bears would ignore us. 'It was quite a beautiful experience and special to be able to interact so closely with the bears in a very safe situation. It was definitely more exciting than scary. 'Often I'd put my camera down and just watch in amazement as these grizzlies finished off salmon right in front of you.' The bears would spend around an hour-and-a-half catching the salmon before heading back to the forest for a nap .

"A California trooper has been filmed brutally beating a woman on the side of a highway - but authorities claimed he simply stopped her for her own safety. A passing motorist recorded the unidentified California Highway Patrol officer as he punched the woman at least 11 times in the head along the 10 Freeway in Los Angeles on Tuesday. On the video uploaded to YouTube, the woman can be seen trying to protect herself by putting up her hands but she does not appear to resist the trooper.

"Buying the wrong bombs, mislaying anti-aircraft missile systems and gifting Germany a property portfolio have led the Ministry of Defence to rack up losses of £1.58 billion in the past two years, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Previously unseen accounts for 2012-13 show that the MoD has written off huge sums of taxpayers’ money after an array of stores losses, accounting errors and what are categorised in the department’s figures as ‘fruitless payments’. The wastage came at a time when the Government was insisting that it needed to sack thousands of Service personnel to balance the books. Figures obtained by this newspaper reveal that in the last financial year the MoD’s bookkeepers were apparently incapable of accounting for £33.6 million in funds allocated for military purposes. A note in the accounts describes a lack of information over the whereabouts of the money – leading to the ‘write-off of unsupported balances’. Documents also show that while the MoD was axeing historic regiments and withdrawing iconic ships and aircraft from service, it was simultaneously giving to Uzbekistan a fleet of 50 Leyland DAF four-ton trucks worth £450,000, and counter-terrorism training equipment to Pakistan worth £294,000. According to the accounts, the  biggest giveaway of all in 2012-13 was handing back the barracks and buildings in Germany which had been in British possession. The documents state that this cost the MoD £1.5  billion in impairment charges. The figures also reveal that hundreds of troops benefited from a clerical error in the wages department. They were overpaid about £640,000 and there are no plans to recover the excess payments. Similarly the MoD has written off £527,000 for missing anti-aircraft missile parts, £743,000 after the disappearance of lightweight field generators, £390,000 for lost kit in Canada and £277,000 for purchasing bombs which no longer suited their training requirements. Among the so-called ‘fruitless payments’ is £1.6 million for towing  HMS Astute after the submarine  ran aground off the Isle of Skye, and £393,000 paid to landowners  and catering contractors following  the late cancellation of military  exercises. 'Fruitless payment': The Royal Navy submarine HMS Astute... before it ran aground off the Isle of Skye, racking up costs of £1.6million . Defence sources stressed last night that such payments were inevitable given the requirement to change planning schedules due to unforeseen circumstances. The MoD accounts also include a list of payments categorised as ‘claims waived or abandoned’. Among these is a £413,000 bill for security at a G8 summit, the £1.5 million overpayment of tax by the department to HM Revenue & Customs and £417,000 to settle a dispute over computer services at the Defence Academy in Swindon. Waste: Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy condemned the MoD's 'multi-million pound mistakes' Last night, Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy said: ‘This incompetent waste will come as a shock to a country angry at defence cuts. ‘Multi-million pound mistakes come at a time of mass sackings of service personnel and defence equipment being scrapped. ‘People will wonder how the Government can lose expensive items  of equipment. Ministers should minimise waste and prioritise protection for those who serve and their families.’ The MoD has also incurred several constructive losses over the last two financial years, though defence sources insist that these payments, such as the cancellation of the Nimrod MRA4 intelligence gathering aircraft at £3.7 billion, the early withdrawal of the Harrier aircraft at £1.2 billion and the retirement of five Royal Navy vessels at £513,000, will save money in the longer term. The MoD said: ‘The figure of £1.5 billion in the accounts reflects the reduction in the value of the German estate as a result of the decision to withdraw UK forces from Germany earlier than planned. This is not the cost of returning personnel and their families by 2019, which will actually save the taxpayer £240 million per year. ‘The vast majority of write-offs are not items lost or wasted but occasions where we have sold off or scrapped redundant military equipment or gifted equipment to another country. ‘Gifting to countries often prevents the UK military having to get directly involved and thus saves the British taxpayer. ‘For the first time, the MoD has a balanced budget and the Armed Forces have a fully funded ten-year Equipment Plan of some £160 billion.’","Ministry of Defence could not account for £33.6million allocated for military purposes .

"Brian Williams has been accused of lying to skip an event honoring members of the armed forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. The allegation comes from a Boston firefighter who served on the committee that organized the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event at the city's national convention center in 2006. Neal Santangelo, a veteran of the Navy submarine service, told the Boston Herald that Williams had agreed six months in advance to serve as master of ceremonies at the gala banquet. Brian Williams appeared briefly during the September 30, 2006, episode when he featured in a Weekend Update sketch alongside Amy Poehler and was informed that Seth Meyers had got the job as her co-anchor . Then on the day of the event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but could only greet guests and leave. According to Santangelo, he arranged for a police escort to rush Williams to the airport so he could get back to New York. He recalls that he and the other organizers were stunned when they found out that the 'pressing engagement' had been a walk-on part on that evening's Saturday Night Live. Williams only appeared briefly during the September 30 episode, featuring in a Weekend Update sketch alongside Amy Poehler in which he was informed that Seth Meyers had got the job as her co-anchor. 'I … cannot believe that you left us for this,' Santangelo wrote in a letter to Williams the following week. 'In an act of egotistical, blatant self-promotion, you deceived the (Medal of Honor) Recipients, declined to break bread with them and disrespected them. The Congressional Medal of Honor is the highest award for valor in action against an enemy force which can be bestowed upon an individual serving in the Armed Services of the United States . 'Pressing engagement': Brian Williams has been accused of lying to skip an event honoring members of the armed forces in 2006 so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live . 'You placed comedy before courage … Your conduct was irreverent, insulting, incomprehensible and shameful. 'You may attempt to 'spin' the issue to support your position, but that will do nothing but bring you further shame in my eyes.' Santangelo told the Herald that he never sent the three-page letter, out of fear he would come off as a 'loose cannon'. He says both the local committee and national Medal of Honor society agreed with his sentiments but he was advised against 'burning bridges.' Williams still sits on several advisory boards of the Medal of Honor Foundation, an adjunct of the MOH society. 'You need to apologize to America's veterans, and to the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces defending freedom around the globe,' Santangelo also wrote in his October 5, 2006, letter. 'Anything less is unacceptable.' Sangangelo admitted that his experience of working with Williams mean't he didn't have any sympathy for the anchor's current troubles. Williams apologized last week for falsely claiming that he was in a helicopter that had been hit by a grenade while in Iraq in 2003, but many critics and veterans have called for him to be fired. The Congressional Medal of Honor is the highest award for valor in action against an enemy force which can be bestowed upon an individual serving in the Armed Services of the United States. Currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in Iraq, a number of Williams' other seemingly outlandish claims are currently coming under increased scrutiny . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies. In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone ‘stuck a .38-caliber in my face.’ Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an army Chinook during the Iraq War in 2003. Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on air apology. ‘Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor,’ he wrote on Facebook. Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the floodwaters and that his hotel was ‘overrun’ with gangs, have been called into question by others who were there. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled ‘Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in.’ In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described a helicopter under fire a distance away. Boston, 2006 . A navy vet has accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the armed forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.","Brian Williams has been accused of lying to skip an event honoring members of the armed forces in 2006 so that he could attend a 'pressing engagement'

"The 14-year-old girl, who has been named locally as Sacha Wheeler (above), was killed after being hit by a train at a railway crossing near Whitstable, Kent . A 14-year-old girl has died after being struck by a train on a foot crossing, where four other people have been killed in the last five years. The teenager, who has been named locally as Sacha Wheeler, was killed after being hit by a train at a railway crossing near Whitstable station in Kent on Sunday. The girl's next of kin have been informed of the incident and police said they are not treating the death as suspicious. British Transport Police said a file would now be passed to the coroner. Tributes have been paid to Sacha, who was a Year 9 pupil at Simon Langton Girls' Grammar School in Canterbury. One friend, called Ellie, wrote on Twitter: 'I miss her so much already. I will never be okay with this. 'RIP Sacha my best friend, you are way too f****** young I love you man x.' Another added: 'This was a tragic accident, my thoughts go out to Sacha's friends and family at this time.' On Facebook, a close friend called Josh Wood, wrote: 'Rest in peace. You was (sic) such a pretty nice girl always laughing and smiling. Always cheered me up when I was down. 'You will be truly missed by everyone. I'll love you always. Gonna be a hard time without you being here (sic).' In a statement released today, Simon Langton Girls' Grammar School headteacher Jane Robinson also paid tribute to Sacha. She said: 'We were deeply saddened to learn of the death of one our pupils. 'Our whole school community is deeply shocked by Sacha’s tragic accident, and our hearts go out to her family. 'So many of the girls have come in with flowers today as a tribute to Sacha, and have written messages on her memory tree. 'She was a great asset to our school and will be sadly missed by us all. 'We have been supporting her classmates today and counselling is being offered to those who need it.' Floral tributes have also been left at the scene of the incident, with one saying: 'We love you Sacha, you will be missed.' Another added: 'You were not known to us, but in passing, you have touched the deepest part of souls forever, rest in peace.' Heartfelt floral tributes have been left at the scene of the incident, which occurred at about 6pm on Sunday . One tribute, believed to be from a pupil at Simon Langton Boys' Grammar School, said: 'We love you Sacha' Another tribute left by a couple unknown to Sacha said: 'You have touched the deepest part of souls forever' The incident occurred at acrossing near Whitstable, Kent, where four others have died in the last five years . The circumstances surrounding the teenager's death have not yet been confirmed. A British Transport Police spokesman said: 'Our officers were called to [the] foot crossing, near Whitstable station, at 6pm on Sunday after reports a person had been struck by a train. 'Colleagues from Kent Police and South East Coast Ambulance Service also attended, but a 14-year-old girl was pronounced dead at the scene. Her family has been informed. 'We are not treating the death as suspicious, but we will prepare a file for the coroner.' There have been four deaths at the pedestrian railway crossing in the last five years. In December 2010, ice cream parlour owner Jan Graham, 54, was killed on the crossing. Friends of Sacha took to social media to the teenager, while others left floral tributes next to the rail crossing . Three weeks later, in January 2011, artist Anne Nacci, also 54, was found dead at the same spot. And in February 2011, tea room owner Anthony Sait, 40, died after being hit by a train on the crossing. All of the deaths were unconnected and the cause of each was found to be suicide. Network Rail today said the crossing is one which it would like to shut down, following the number of fatalities. A spokesman said: 'This was a tragic incident and our thoughts are with her family and friends. 'We want to close level crossings where we can and this is one that we would like to close. Closing a crossing isn't always a simple or easy. 'To do so, we need to work very closely with people who use the crossing and our lineside neighbours.'","14-year-old killed after being struck by a train at railway crossing in Kent .

"Flight restrictions relating to drones and national parks, military bases and near airports are clear and strict. But since unmanned crafts have become more popular, homeowners and businesses are increasingly concerned about the drones flying over their private property. To allay these fears, a pilot from California has teamed up with drone makers to create a global database that lets anyone set up no-fly zones above their homes and offices. Scroll down for video . To add a zone, users need to enter the location, their name and an email address to verify the request. This address is converted into a latitude and longitude point which is then sent to drone makers and added to a no-fly database. Many drones have technology that automatically prevents them flying over listed regions . To add a zone, users must enter their location, name and an email address to verify the request. This address is converted into a latitude and longitude point, as well as a series of points that accurately marks out the edges of a property. For the first property the site doesn’t ask for proof of residence, but for subsequent addresses users need to show a form of identification or utility bill. The address is then sent to drone makers and added to a no-fly database used each time a drone takes off.

By partnering with Mr Marcus, these makers promise to adhere to the registered zones but are not under a legal obligation to do so. And the size of the zone depends on individual makers, although Mr Marcus recommends it covers 500ft (152 metres) around each property. Other drone manufacturers are not obliged to comply to the no-fly zone you have established, however. Legally, drones can’t be flown over restricted airspace including national parks, military bases and within a five mile (8km) radius of medium and large airports. Commercial drones are additionally subject to stricter laws and regulation. ‘Evolving technology is allowing drones to have a positive impact on everyday lives through many applications. However, drones may also affect lives in a negative way,’ explained Mr Marcus. ‘Many people are concerned about their privacy and safety [and] NoFlyZone.org offers these people a method to control the airspace above their property and to prevent drones from flying over. ‘While the FAA and other similar regulatory agencies around the world struggle with implementing rules about drones, drone manufacturers and operators want to take a proactive step to self-regulate and deliver quality products and services while minimizing negative consequences.

NoFlyZone then unblocks that airspace, and people can unblock their property at any time. The updates to the database aren’t made automatically, however. The site sends the database to drone partners on a monthly basis, and any new drones produced after drone manufacturers are sent the latest database will include the latest properties. ‘It could take some time before all in-service drones are updated to include your property in the no-fly database', continued Mr Marcus. ‘In the future, when drones are connected by internet, we plan to update your privacy settings by pushing the information to the drones over internet in near-real time.’","Database was set up by pilot Ben Marcus from Santa Monica, California .

"The father who claims his wife abandoned their newborn son because he has Down syndrome has  four other children from a previous marriage, including a girl with the same condition, Daily Mail Australia can reveal. Samuel Forrest and his wife Ruzan Badalyan split just a week after their son Leo was born with Down syndrome in Armenia on January 21. Mr Forrest, who says his wife of 18 months abandoned their son because her family were ashamed of his condition, has made global headlines since he started crowd fundraising to bring Leo to his native New Zealand. Samuel Forrest left New Zealand a few years ago following a messy divorce that saw him lose his four young children (pictured), including his youngest daughter who has Down syndrome - the same condition affected his three-week-old son Leo . More details of Mr Forrest's background are emerging, including that he left New Zealand four years ago following a messy divorce that saw him lose his three daughters and one son. His youngest daughter was born with Down syndrome - the same condition affecting three-week-old son Leo. Mr Forrest, who lived with his wife and children in Whanganui on New Zealand's north island, was brought up as a member of the Exclusive Brethren church. He was ex-communicated from the church  when he divorced his wife and was banned from seeing his four children, now aged between six and 15 years old. Samuel Forrest  split from his wife just a week after their son Leo was born with Down syndrome in Armenia on January 21 . Mr Forrest, who says his wife of 18 months abandoned their son because her family were ashamed of his condition, has made global headlines since he started crowd fundraising to bring Leo to his native New Zealand . In a series of emails around the time he left the church, Mr Forrest repeatedly says he 'lost four innocent children' and blames the Exclusive Brethren for the 'deliberate break-up of a family'. Daily Mail Australia has obtained a photo of Mr Forrest with his four children before he lost contact with them in 2011. 'All his extended family are also members of the Exclusive Brethren and are still forbidden by their religion to have any contact with him,' a source said. 'It was one of the reasons why he left in the first place and went to Armenia. He had no contact with his children and saw no future for himself in New Zealand. It was all very sad.' Mr Forrest married his Armenian wife Ruzan Badalyan 18 months ago and they divorced a week after baby Leo was born on January 21 . Mr Forrest's crowd funding website has already raised more than $490,000 in his bid to bring up baby Leo in Auckland where he can have access to established disability services . Mr Forrest married his Armenian wife Ruzan Badalyan 18 months ago and they divorced a week after baby Leo was born. At the time, Mr Forrest said his wife refused to look at or even touch Leo because Armenian culture believes a child with a condition like Down syndrome brings shame on the entire family. She has been under scrutiny since her decision to give up Leo was made public. Mr Forrest, who was brought up as a member of the Exclusive Brethren church in New Zealand, was ex-communicated after he divorced his wife in 2011. He hasn't seen his family since . Mr Forrest wrote on his crowd-funding website on Monday that he 'still feels a great deal of love' for his ex-wife despite her decision to give up their son. 'I can assure you that I have tried my best to convince my wife we could keep the baby, but in her family, an orphanage seemed a safer option for Armenia,' he wrote. 'I did everything I could to keep our family together, including suggesting we all go to New Zealand together. Her family also spent time trying to persuade me to surrender our son to an orphanage. 'Ruzan should not be the target of all of the frustrations that this situation has created. Our paths may be moving in different directions, but she is Leo's mother and I still feel a great deal of love for her.' It comes after Ms Badalyan hit back at her ex-husband's claims she abandoned her baby, instead saying she had to make a 'ruthless decision' in the best interests of Leo. She released a statement via Facebook saying the long-awaited birth of her son was the happiest day, but when she woke she could only see alarmed faces around her. 'My first question was about the whereabouts of my child. I remember the sad faces of my relatives and the doctors and the diagnosis that sounded like a verdict: ""Your child was born with a Down Syndrome."" One can never imagine my feelings at that moment,' she wrote. 'Hardly had I recovered from the first shock, when the doctor approached me and told me to voice my decision whether I was going to keep Leo or not. I had to make the most ruthless decision in my life within several hours. At the time of Leo's birth, Mr Forrest said his wife refused to look at or even touch Leo because Armenian culture believes a child with a condition like Down syndrome brings shame on the entire family . Mr Forrest wrote on his crowd-funding website on Monday that he 'still feels a great deal of love' for his ex-wife despite her decision to give up their son . 'The first thing that came to my mind after the diagnosis was that I don't want my child to live in a country where certain stereotypes dominate the lives of people with DS and no opportunities at all. I want him to be involved and well-received in society, an integration that will require years and years for our society to adjust to. 'I saw the evasive looks of the doctors, my relatives' tear-stained faces, received calls of condolences and realised that only a move to a country with such standards as New Zealand would entitle my son to a decent life.' Leo's mother said the cost of raising a children with a disability also weighed on her. 'In Armenia every child is loved and respected and family is a high value, but in this country children with special needs do require special attention, huge financial resources and dedication,' she said. 'In the hardest moment of my life when my husband should be next to me and support and help to take the right decision, I could not find any support from his side. 'After that incident, he left the hospital notifying me hours later that he was taking the kid with him, that he is going to leave the country for New Zealand and I do not have anything to do with the situation.' Ms Badalyan (pictured here on her wedding day) hit back at her ex-husband's claims she abandoned her baby, instead saying she had to make a 'ruthless decision' in the best interests of Leo . Leo's mother said the cost of raising a children with a disability also weighed on her and described the decision as the 'hardest moment of my life' Ruzan Badalyn (left) pictured at her wedding alongside her sister Arevik will remain in Armenia after filing for divorce for her New Zealand husband . Mr Forrest's crowd funding website has already raised more than $490,000 in his bid to bring up baby Leo in Auckland where he can have access to established disability services and adequate support. But it is unclear how much family support he will receive when he returns. 'It's well known within the Exclusive Brethren community that Sam has been cut off by everyone because of divorcing his wife. He has no one to come back to,' a source said. 'You would hope that he'd get some support but it's very unlikely.' Mr Forrest has been left stunned by the outpouring of support since he first shared his story. The outpouring of kind emotions and great wishes has been overwhelming. Leo is one lucky guy,' he said. 'He is doing well and is very healthy. He gets visitors daily who shower him with love and affection. Leo is the number one priority for me right now and needs all my attention.' He said the money raised was far beyond what they expected or needed. The money will be used find a house in Auckland and to give Leo education opportunities. There are also plans to use some of the funds to support parents in Armenia who are raising children with disabilities. For more information on Leo's cause, visit www.gofundme.com/bringleohome.

"The mastermind behind the Bali Nine drug trafficking plot is allegedly currently enjoying an extravagant lifestyle in Sydney, having literally won the lottery after he escaped all convictions. The unnamed man is living the high-life whilst two Australian men, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, face execution by firing squad this month. It's alleged the ringleader won $5 million after the nine Australians were arrested in 2005, according to Sydney Morning Herald. This comes as Indonesia's attorney-general said he plans to move this month's executions forward, effectively ruling out the chance of of Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers entering a fresh legal challenge against their death penalties. Australian Halen Chan (L), the mother of death-row prisoner Andrew Chan, and brother Michael Chan (R), leave after visiting Andrew at Kerobokan Prison on February 10 in Denpasar, Bali . Ken Chan, the father of Andrew Chan, leaves after visiting Andrew at Kerobokan Prison on February 10 . The unnamed drug lord who masterminded the Bali Nine plot had been the subject of previous police investigations into drug trafficking before the 2005 bust. However, he stepped away from his life of crime following his incredibly lucky lotto win, according to SMH. Chan and Sukumaran have never exposed the identity or the person or people they were working for, fearing they would put their families in Australia in danger. According to Fairfax, the mastermind behind the 2005 Australia to Indonesia drug run is suspected of having a high-level involvement in the syndicate. Chan and Sukumaran were handed death penalties in 2006 and all subsequent appeals have failed. The Bali Nine duo's lawyers are planning a challenge of the presidential decree that denied them clemency in the State Administrative Court. But Indonesian Attorney-General HM Prasetyo predicts the challenge will fail. Raji Sukumaran (R), the mother of Myuran Sukumaran, a Australian convicted of drug smuggling on Indonesia's death row, arrives for a visit at Kerobokan jail . Andrew Chan's brother Michael arrives to visit his brother on February 10. The families have been visiting frequently following the government's announcement that the two men on death row will be killed this month . 'Clemency is a prerogative which cannot be hindered or challenged by anyone,' he told reporters in Jakarta on Tuesday. 'That's the prerogative right attached to the authority who has it. 'The administrative court cannot change that decision.' But the attorney-general also said it was also open to the president to reconsider clemency requests. The two men facing imminent death reportedly only had low-to-mid-level involvement. However, there are new reports that there is a possibility the execution of the two Australians will be further delayed. Indonesia's justice and human rights minister, Yasonna Laoly, has claimed the executions may not take place this month due to political tensions, according to ABC News. Family members of Myuran Sukumaran arrive for a visit at Kerobokan jail. The two men on death row recently lost their final appeals for clemency despite arguing that they had rehabilitated themselves in prison . The delay would occur due a conflict in Indonesia between corruption investigators and the national police force. However, attorney-general Muhammad Prasetyo contradicted Laoly's claims, insisting that the executions would go ahead as planned. Helen Chan, the mother of convicted Bali Nine drug smuggler Andrew Chan, has made an impassioned plea for her son's life to be spared as he, along with Myuran Sukumaran, face execution by firing squad this month. On the ABC-TV Four Corners program she described his daily life as 'every day he is walking in the valley of death' Raji Sukumaran, meantime, has on Monday blamed the Australian Federal Police for her son's plight after they tipped off Indonesian authorities but those same officials insist they would do the same again and also into the future. 'It's a strange thing to wish to spend the rest of your life in prison. But we don't want them to die,' she said. The families of the Australians on death row have made a trip to Jakarta's presidential palace on to plead for the two Sydney men to be spared. Scroll down for video . Helen Chan, mother of Australian death row prisoner Andrew Chan, accompanied by her son Michael, has pleaded to Indonesian authorities to spare her son from the death penalty . Raji Sukumaran, mother of convicted Australian drug-smuggler, Myuran Sukumaran, reacts after making an emotional appeal to Indonesian authorities not to carry out the execution of her son during a media conference in Jakarta on Monday. The mothers of the two Australians facing the executive begged authorities to 'spare our sons' lives', as their lawyers revealed plans for a last-gasp legal bid . Raji Sukumaran, the mother of death-row prisoner Myuran Sukumaran, her son Chintu Sukumaran (far left), is pictured with Helen Chan (second from right), the mother of fellow death-row inmater Andrew Chan, and her son Michael Chan (far right) during a visit at the national human rights commission in Jakarta . He is willing to face it, he is not ignoring his wrongdoing,' she said. 'This is what I am proud of. I feel that he is very down to earth - facing death every day, but not crying or making a scene. 'Therefore this time when I see him, although I am sad, I have inner peace.' Her son Andrew told Four Corners that he will continue to read and stay fit. 'Here I am, I sit here and I study. People say I can't. I sit here on a death-row sentence and most people turn around and go, 'It's a waste of time.' I believe it's not. I believe the Lord has a purpose for me. And it's not here and it's not to die.' Bali Nine duo Myuran Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right) could be executed by the end of the month . Sukumaran's mother Raji and his brother Chinthu along with Chan's mother Helen and his brother Michael will meet with Indonesia's national human rights organisation Komnas HAM to set forth the legal battle in a bid to save the condemned pair's lives. 'Our days are very difficult, we can't stop thinking of what will happen and the violent way he will be killed. My mum keeps thinking about his and Andrew's dead body being handed to her, she is having nightmares,' Chinthu Sukumaran said. 'Why is it that the Indonesian president does not give him a chance and have pity on us being aged parents?' Ms Chan told Four Corners. 'We are old and in poor health and we do not have long to live, therefore we would not like to see our son go before us.' It follows after the lawyer who represented the Bali Nine ringleaders when they were first sentenced to death row is putting his job on the line by claiming he has new evidence that could save the duo. Australians on death row Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are scheduled for execution this month. 'I was stupid. I didn't really think through the consequences or anything. Somebody asked me to do something and I just sort of did it' Myuran Sukumaran said to Four Corners . In an extraordinary twist, Muhammad Rifan says he has 'never revealed evidence' that could discredit him but he was prepared to ' take the heat' for the Australian drug smugglers, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who are expected to face the firing squad by the end of the month. 'It's something that implicates us, it could discredit me. But for them I will take it. I told Myuran it's okay,' he said. 'It's one last thing I can do for them.' 'Those judges, I believe they were very sorry because after sentencing them to death, they told me that was not want they wanted. 'This highlights the problems that time, between the Indonesian government and the Australian government. 'Look, you know, I think every criminal, what rushes to their mind, they're not gonna get busted, full stop,' said Andrew Chan . 'I see at that time, the judges were not independent in sentencing the case.' Even though the families blame the Australian Federal Police for the son's fate, Mike Phelan, who led the Australian probe into the Bali Nine, said: 'I think it's a tragedy that we've got young lives that are potentially facing the death penalty, but I believe it was a successful operation and, you know, taking eight kilograms of heroin, which is a very significant amount of heroin, off the streets is a significant operation.' Sukumaran admitted on the ABC program: 'I was stupid. I didn't really think through the consequences or anything. Somebody asked me to do something and I just sort of did it because they were my friends and I trusted them and I believed in them. 'Look, you know, I think every criminal, what rushes to their mind, they're not gonna get busted, full stop,' said Andrew Chan. But a final clear warning from Mr Phelan. 'Even with the aid of hindsight, should the same set of circumstances present themselves again with another syndicate or other people, we would exactly the same thing.'","The mastermind behind the Bali Nine drug trafficking plot lives in Sydney .

"A onetime California school official was sentenced Monday to 10 years in state prison for sexually assaulting two women when they were her students, including a woman who confronted her in a recorded phone call that went viral on YouTube. Andrea Cardosa, 41, of Perris, was sentenced in Riverside County Superior Court on three charges of committing lewd acts on a child. She avoided a potential life sentence by pleading guilty last month. Prosecutors dropped more than a dozen other counts. Guilty: Andrea Michelle Cardosa, an educator who was confronted with allegations of abuse in a phone call by a former student who then posted the conversation on YouTube, has been jailed for 10 years . Pleaded guilty: Cardosa was charged with abusing a former student at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside beginning when the girl was 12. The abuse lasted from 1997 to 2001, prosecutors said . Old photo: Andrea Cardosa has been accused by a former student of sexually abusing her when she was 12 . Cardosa was charged with abusing a former student at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside beginning when the girl was 12. The abuse lasted from 1997 to 2001, prosecutors said. In court papers, prosecutors said Cardosa molested the girl more than 100 times in a locker room and Cardosa's car, and at the home of Cardosa's sister. In a recording that was posted online in January 2014, the former student telephoned Alhambra High School, where Cardosa was assistant principal, and confronted her. The now 29-year-old mother Jamie Carrillo said that she made the video post as the statute of limitations has run out for her to be able to prosecute and that she didn't want Cardosa around other children. In the call, she tells the woman, who identifies herself as Ms Cardosa, that she did something terribly wrong at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside 15 years ago. Ms Carrillo then asks what the woman would do if a student told her that she was having a sexual relationship with a teacher to which she replies that she would involve law enforcement. 'You should be so ashamed and so disgusted with yourself,' the caller said. 'I am. I am,' Cardosa said. 'I regret it every day. Every day.' Cardosa later resigned. Confession: The then  28-year-old Jamie Carillo posted a YouTube video where she confronted the woman who allegedly sexually abused her in middle school . Took her on trips: Ms Carrillo said that the teacher (pictured right) took her on out of town trips and made her feel 'special' More than one: After Jamie Carillo (pictured) posted her video on YouTube, a second alleged victim came forward to say that she had also been abused . She asks: 'So how is that any different from what you did when I was at Chemawa Middle?' To which the convicted molester answered: 'It's not.' Ms Carrillo goes on to tell her attacker that she has children of her own and that her former teacher's actions ruined her life and that she is 'disgusting'. When she hangs up the phone, Ms Carrillo shows that she made the call on the screen and reads out the number. She says: 'And I'm shaking like a leaf... not even an ''I'm sorry.'' Or anything. Just that she regrets it.' Horrific abuse: The 29-year-old alleges that her former teacher (left) abused her when she was a student at a California high school . Alhambra Unified School District Superintendent Laura Tellez-Gagliano released a statement saying the YouTube link was emailed to the school and they passed it to the Alhambra Police Department. Ms Carrillo said that the coach kissed her in the locker room and put her hand down the then 12-year-old's pants. The former student then said Ms Cardosa, who is believed to have been in her mid-twenties at the time of the assaults, organized out of town trips so that she could have sex with the underage girl. The 29-year-old said: 'Everything was stolen from me. She just completely manipulated me into thinking that I needed her and I wanted it.' Cardosa molested the girl over 100 times, and acts were committed in a locker room, Cardosa's car, and at the home of Cardosa's sister, where the two were almost discovered. The ex-student spoke at Cardosa's sentencing. 'I will stand up for my 12-year-old self who did not have anyone to fight for her,' the woman, now 28, said in a written victim-impact statement she read in court. 'It is never OK for an adult to betray the trust of a child.' Another former student came forward after the recording appeared online. Brianna, now 18, told detectives that she met Cardosa when she was a student at a middle school in Perris. She said Cardosa drove her to a secluded area in 2010, where she tried to kiss her and inappropriately touched her. Cardosa was charged with abusing that victim from 2009 to 2010 while she was a 15-year-old student at Tomas Rivera Middle School in Perris. A statement was read in court on behalf of that woman, who described having nightmares and trust issues. 'How will I ever trust anyone around my son?' she said in the statement. The victims also have sued the Riverside Unified and Val Verde Unified school districts.","Andrea Cardosa, a former assistant principal, pleaded guilty to three counts of lewd acts with a child under 14 .

"A British family have been awarded £12,300 by Thomas Cook after their Mexico holiday turned into a disaster. Dianne Blakeway, 57, her husband Roy, 61 and sons Ben, 20, and Robert, 30, all fell ill with a violent gastric bug during their trip to the Gran Caribe Real Resort & Spa in Cancun. After recovering from the illness, Mrs Blakeway, from Cheshire, then had a fall on her way to the restaurant, leaving her in severe pain and with soft tissue injuries. Thomas Cook had initially denied liability but eventually reached an out-of-court settlement. The family were awarded £5,800 for the illness and a further £6,500 for Mrs Blakeway's accident. Dianne Blakeway (right) with her sons (fro left) Robert, 30, Ben, 20, and husband Roy, 61. The family from Cheshire won a settlement from Thomas Cook after suffering stomach illness on holiday in Mexico. Dianne also received a payout after an injury suffered in a fall while walking to the restaurant . The Blakeways stayed at Gran Caribe Real Resort & Spa in Cancun to celebrate a family wedding . The Blakeways had been in Mexico in May 2014 as part of a 24-strong party celebrating a family wedding. 'After the outbreak, the resort closed the restaurant for two days, whilst men in white suits were seen disinfecting corridors and rooms,' Mrs Blakeway said. 'Glasses were no longer being used for drinks and were replaced with plastic cups.' According to Holiday Illness Claims, owned by Farnworth Rose solicitors, Thomas Cook reached a settlement after court proceedings were issued. A spokesperson for Thomas Cook told MailOnline Travel: 'Thomas Cook is sorry that the Blakeway family fell ill and Mrs Blakeway was injured while on holiday at the Gran Caribe Real Resort & Spa, Mexico . 'We can confirm that we have reached an agreement with the family’s legal representatives and that this matter is now resolved.' The lobby of the Gran Caribe Real Resort & Spa in Cancun where they Blakeways stayed . The holiday company added: 'Thomas Cook makes strenuous efforts to ensure the quality and safety of the holidays it sells having dedicated teams who undertake audit programmes and work with hotels in the event that issues are identified. 'We would kindly ask any customers who may have concerns relating to their holiday to contact us as quickly as possible while in resort or the UK so that we can deal with them personally in an open, honest and fair manner.' It is important to make sure you have all the correct inoculations ahead of travel, particularly when venturing to more exotic climes beyond Europe. When in any resort, take all the necessary precautions to avoid falling ill, washing hands, staying away from food if you are not happy with how it has been cooked or presented or using probiotics to help increase resistance to bugs. Also, make sure you pack a first aid kit with medicines you may need as well as plasters, rehydration sachets, antiseptic wipes and painkillers. Tesco Bank recommends holidaymakers try and avoid undercooked meat, shellfish and salads as they may not have been washed in safe water. If you fall ill despite taking precautions, flag it immediately to your hotel and tour operator, especially if the illness results in cancelled day tours etc. The companies will need a record of your illness, and may even call a doctor for you, in order to help facilitate refunds if needed. Travel insurance is key if illness progresses, with average bills for healthcare abroad reaching £900 according to the Association of British Insurers (ABI). In Europe, the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) is not a substitute for travel insurance, but will afford the carrier to receive hospital treatment in the European Economic Area and Switzerland on the same basis as a resident of that country. Contact your insurer at the earliest possible moment as emergency helplines can assist with suggesting and arranging appropriate medical facilities, liaising with hospitals on your behalf and offering guidance on what to do next. According to the ABI, your policy will normally stipulate an amount below which you should pay for the treatment received – usually £500 – and then claim that back from your insurer when you return to the UK. Where the cost is above the amount stipulated in your policy, your insurer will normally be able to settle the bill on your behalf. Tracy Stansfield, the solicitor who acted for Dianne in her injury claim, said: 'I am pleased we were able to reach a settlement for Mrs Blakeway after the problems she encountered during her holiday.' 'It is very unfortunate to suffer both personal injury and illness whilst on holiday,' she said. 'I'm delighted we were able to help the Blakeways obtain compensation for the very nasty illnesses they experienced.'","Cheshire family win £5,800 out-of-court settlement after a stomach bug .

"Shamed former IMF-chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has told a court that tales of his roles in sex parties with prostitutes have been exaggerated as he 'only' attended four per year. The 65-year-old, who is facing charges of 'aggravated pimping', tried to play down his role in the alleged sex ring, saying he only attended 12 orgies in three years. Topless protesters  jumped on his car as he arrived at the court in Lille, north of France, this morning, where the disgraced finance boss gave evidence today. Accused: Former International Monetary Fund head Dominique Strauss-Kahn, right, leaves a court in Lille, France, where he is facing charges of 'aggravated pimping', . Denial: Strauss-Kahn, pictured this afternoon, after attending the trial in the so-called 'Carlton Affair' where 14 people including Strauss-Kahn stand accused of sex offences including the alleged procuring of prostitutes . A topless Femen protester climbs on top of the car carrying former IMF chief Dominique Strauss Kahn to court this morning in northern France . The former chief of the International Monetary Fund was giving evidence today at the courthouse in Lille, where he said the frequency of sex parties was 'rare' and had been 'exaggerated'. But on his arrival, three women from the feminist group Femen, who had slogans scrawled on their half-naked bodies jumped on the vehicle carrying Strauss Kahn. They also hurled insults as the car he was travelling in attempted to enter an underground parking area at the court in Lille, northern France. They were eventually rounded up by police with pictures showing some of the women lying on the floor while officers tried to detain them. The protest came as Strauss Kahn arrived at court this morning where he testified in his alleged role in sex parties with prostitutes. The three women, who had slogans scrawled on their half-naked bodies also hurled abuse at the car carrying Strauss Kahn . Police eventually rounded up the three women with one of them being held on the ground as she was detained by officers . The 65-year-old is accused of participating in a French sex ring and instigating parties involving prostitutes in the northern French city of Lille, as well as Paris, Brussels and Washington DC between 2008 and 2011. His lawyers acknowledge their client took part in the parties but say he did not know the women were prostitutes and have rejected the charge against him of pimping, or 'procuring with aggravating circumstances.' But giving evidence today he said he rarely took part in sex parties adding that there were only 12 parties in total - that is four per year over three years. He also insisted that he hadn't committed a crime or any offence and attacked his accusers, saying he had done nothing wrong, and simply enjoyed a 'libertine' sex life. Looking tired and drawn, and dressed in dark navy blue suit, Strauss-Kahn stood with his hands folded as judges asked him questions. The protest this morning came as Strauss Kahn arrived at court for the trial where he is expected to give evidence today .

A fellow protester with a message scrawled across her back is carried away by police officers in front of the courthouse in Lille . A court sketch showing Strauss Kahn giving evidence during his trial in Lille . One of his accusers meanwhile told the court that she was 'forced into' certain sex acts against her will, while Strauss-Kahn stared at her 'smiling'. Referring to his co-defendants, Strauss-Kahn told the court: 'We didn't communicate daily. I had, without wanting to sound pretentious, other things to do at the time'. Strauss-Kahn, who was said to be the 'King of the Party' in the vice ring, added: 'One has the impression of frenetic activity, but we only had four meetings a year for three years.' Asked about the prostitutes who attended his sex parties, the man who is known in France by his initials DSK, replied: 'If you want to know if I was aware of the status of these young women, then the answer is no. 'I had no knowledge that they were prostitutes.' Four prostitutes identified as Melanie, Mounia, Sabrina and Sandrine are civil plaintiffs in the case. Today was the first time he has come face-to-face with two of them, now retired sex workers, since the parties. DSK, who was married to the journalist and art heiress Anne Sinclair at the time of the offences, denies all the charges. Investigating magistrates say that the charge applies because in France it covers any activity seen as facilitating prostitution . Strauss Kahn, pictured in the back seat of a car, arriving at court this morning. He faces charges of 'aggravated pimping' Dominique Strauss Kahn (file picture) risks as much as 10 years in prison and a fine of up to 1.5 million euros (£1.1million) if convicted . In Strauss-Kahn's case, it is alleged that he allowed his rented apartment to be used for sex parties involving prostitutes and that the parties were organised for his benefit. The three-week trial began last week with 14 people, including Strauss-Kahn, defendants in the 'Carlton Affair' case, so named after the hotel in Lille that sparked the investigation into a sex ring. Strauss-Kahn, who was once tipped for the French presidency now says his political career is over and risks as much as 10 years in prison and a fine of up to 1.5 million euros (£1.1million) if convicted. He served as French finance minister in the late 1990s before becoming one of the world's most influential decision-makers in 2007 as head of the International Monetary Fund, a public lender that plays a central role worldwide in the rescue of failing economies. But his high-flying career ended in May 2011 when he was escorted handcuffed into custody in New York following accusations of sexual assault by a New York maid in 2011, which were eventually dropped.","Three Femen protesters attempted to jump on car carrying Strauss Kahn .

"The BBC has probed its coverage of the Baftas  after hundreds of viewers complained about bad language during the show. Host Stephen Fry made a number of risqué and foul-mouthed remarks during Sunday's award ceremony, which was watched by 5.5 million viewers when it was aired on the BBC. At one point the comedian told the audience it was 'p***ing down with stars' inside, while later he introduced Tom Cruise as 'Tom f***ing Cruise' when the Mission Impossible star came on stage to present an award. The BBC confirmed it had received 293 'complaints about language during the show'. The BBC has probed its coverage of the Baftas after a string of viewers complained about bad language used by host Stephen Fry .

The comedian, a regular host of the film awards, also raised eyebrows among audience members after apparently imitating scientist Stephen Hawking's electronically synthesised voice. Professor Hawking - who is known for his good humour as well as his fearsome intelligence - made jokes on stage while presenting an award, declaring at one point that he was 'better looking' than host Mr Fry. Fry then stunned the audience when he responded to the friendly banter from the notoriously good-humoured Hawking with a joke about his voice. After the prize-winners left the stage, he wrapped up, muttering 'that was really super' in what appeared to be an impression of Professor Hawking's electronic voice. A statement on the BBC's complaints website said: 'We received complaints from viewers unhappy with some of Stephen Fry's language while presenting the Baftas.' It went on: 'The Baftas is not a BBC event, but during our coverage of the awards ceremony we try to find a compromise between presenting the events of the night as they happened, while remaining within the expectations of the majority of the viewers at home - which saw over 5.5 million people tuning in to watch.

'Stephen, whose irreverence and style is extremely well-known to viewers, has presented the Baftas for several years.

"It's a simple glass bottle with a red top that has become a symbol of soy sauce in Japan and much of the world. More than half a century after its creation, the Kikkoman soy sauce bottle remains a familiar and comforting shape on restaurant and dining room tables in many countries. Sumi Murayama, 71, has purchased soy sauce in the bottles since she opened a Japanese restaurant in Tokyo 40 years ago. 'The best part of the bottle is its smart red cap, which doesn't drip,' she said. 'Its simplicity perfectly fits a downtown restaurant like this.' The bottle's designer, Kenji Ekuan, died Saturday of a heart condition at age 85. Kikkoman, the world's largest soy sauce brewer, said the bottle helped bring its brand out of the kitchen into restaurants and dining rooms. It says it has sold 400 million bottles around the world since its creation in 1961. Scroll down for video . Hot commodity: Kikkoman, the world's largest soy brewer, says it has sold 400 million bottles of soy sauce around the world since its creation in 1961 . Remembered: Kenji Ekuan, whose works ranged from a bullet train to the red-capped Kikkoman soy sauce dispenser, died of a heart problem at a Tokyo hospital early Saturday . Ekuan, who is a former monk, crafted his iconic tabletop soy sauce bottle for Kikkoman Corp. in 1961. He went on to design the Komachi bullet train connecting Tokyo and northern Japan . Ekuan's works ranged from a bullet train to the red-capped Kikkoman soy sauce dispenser. His office, GK Industrial Design Group, said Monday that Ekuan died of a heart problem at a Tokyo hospital early Saturday. A former monk, Ekuan crafted his iconic tabletop bottle, as familiar as the classic Coca-Cola bottle, for Kikkoman Corp. in 1961. The New York Times reported that before the dispenser's final design was achieved, Ekuan spent three years working on the project -- and also created 100 prototypes. He won international popularity both for the handy, flask-shaped dispenser and of course for the salty brown condiment that flavored many Asian cuisines. The Tokyo native has said he wanted to design a small bottle because of his childhood memory of his mother pouring soy sauce from a big half-gallon bottle to a tabletop dispenser. His dispenser has been used ever since,  the New York Times reported in 2012. At the time, the newspaper reported that over 300 million bottles had been sold globally. Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) curator Paola Antonelli explained to NPR this week why the bottle is included in the museum's collection. 'The bottle is in the collection because it is working perfectly,' Antonelli said. 'I mean, you've never found a clogged spout, I don't think, even if you leave the soy sauce there in your fridge for a long time. 'And also, this beautiful, sensible and extremely graceful design is at the same time ancient and extremely contemporary.' Anttonelli also said on the radio program that 'soy sauce was really important for the identity of Japan after the Second World War. It was a way to actually recover an international profile. 'And originally, the soy sauce was sold in really big bottles. And Kenji was put in charge to package it in a way that could be understood and exported to the whole world. And he did succeeded.' Other of Ekuan's renowned works include the Yamaha VMAX motorcycle, the Komachi bullet train connecting Tokyo and northern Japan, the Narita Express airport liner, as well as audio equipment and company logos. His designs originate from the sights of Hiroshima’s devastation after the U.S. atomic bombing of the city 70 years ago. Other of his renowned works include the Yamaha VMAS motorcycle, the Komachi bullet train (pictured) connecting Tokyo and northern Japan, the Narita Express airport liner, as well as audio equipment and company logos . He heard the voices of street cars, bicycles and other objects mangled and abandoned, saying they had to have been utilized more, he is quoted as saying in a company pamphlet for his Hiroshima exhibit last year. His design principle was a 'democratization' of goods and beauty, to make them accessible for everyone. Ekuan wanted to become a maker of everyday things. Before entering the design world, however, Ekuan became a monk at a Hiroshima temple to succeed his father, who died due to radiation from the atomic bombing. But he eventually changed his path. He graduated from the prestigious Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music in 1955 and went on to get a degree from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. He founded his design studio in 1957. The Huffington Post reported that that the studio is now called GK Design Group, and features a total of twelve firms that focus on different types of design. Last year, Ekuan received a prestigious Italian industrial design prize, the Golden Compass Award, after winning several other international awards. When telling Japan Times about his designs in 2001, he said: 'Design to me has always meant making people happy. 'Happy in the sense of creating items that provide comfort, convenience, function, aesthetics and ethics. 'I used to do a lot of research, fieldwork, wanting to understand the psychology of human needs and response.’ He also designed Yamaha motorcycles, like the one pictured above.

"For 4,000 years, the remains of a small child lay buried beneath a Scottish beach until storms recently exposed the makeshift grave. The child - who is believed to have been around 10 years old at the time of death - was discovered by a walker in Orkney. And now remarkable pictures of the subsequent excavation  show how the complete skeleton was almost perfectly preserved in the sand. An almost complete skeleton of a 4,000-year-old child (shown in image) has been found in Orkney, Scotland. The child - who is believed to have been between 10 and 12 years old at the time of death - was discovered by walker and tour guide Carrie Brown, 32 . The shocking discovery - dating back to the early neolithic period - was made by tour guide Carrie Brown, 32. The child would have have been buried around the same time the pyramids were being built in Egypt. Ms Brown was on a stroll with her partner Ali Thorne, 34, to look at a rock they hoped could be a burial stone, when they discovered the skeleton. But mystery remains about how the child died and if the skeleton belonged to a boy or girl. 'The reason we were there was due to a stone we saw before Christmas time. We thought it might have some runic writing on it,' Ms Brown said. 'We noticed what looked like ribs sticking out of the sand. Three or four ribs were exposed.I thought it was human, or very much hoped it was. 'We told the local archaeologist who quickly had a look and said it was.' The amazing skeleton was found on an beach in Orkney in Scotland . The discovery is said to date back to the early Neolithic period meaning the child would have been buried under the sand (pictured) around the same time as the pyramids were being built in Egypt . The pictures of the subsequent excavation of the grave show how complete skeleton was carefully removed from the site on Sunday. The mystery remains about how the child died and  whether it was a boy or girl . Ms Brown (left) was on a stroll with her partner Ali Thorne, 34 (right) to look at a rock they hoped could be a burial stone. 'We noticed what looked like ribs sticking out of the sand,' said Ms Brown. 'Three or four ribs were exposed. I thought it was human, or very much hoped it was' The remains of the child appear to pre-date one of Orkney's most important archaeological finds - uncovered on the same island after storms. In 1985, a  local farmer found a collection of bones jutting out from an exposed sandbank. Several years later after the site was excavated, a 21.3ft (6.5 metres) viking long boat was uncovered alongside the human remains. Items including an iron sword, a quiver containing eight arrows, a bone comb and a set of 22 gaming pieces were found to date back to between 875 AD and 950 AD. Evidence of human occupation of the remote Orkney Isles appears at around the fourth millennium BC. By this time the bands of hunter-gatherers of the Mesolithic had gradually evolved into a agricultural society. She continued: 'We regularly go on beach walks. Orkney is a great place for archaeology - I've always been interested in it. 'I knew it wasn't the correct thing to do to dig further. I would have been slightly nervous. 'I certainly wasn't expecting to find human remains.' Ms Brown made the discovery last Tuesday and, after the skull was exposed by the local archaeologist, Historic Scotland was called to the scene. Expert archaeologists worked on the site for several days and on Monday the remains were fully removed for carbon dating. Ms Brown said: 'They gave me an approximate date of around 3,000 to 4,000 years old. A child between the age of 10 and 12.' She believes winter storms are the reason why, after 4,000 years, the child has since been uncovered. 'There have been heavy storms here over the last few months,' she said. 'Things get covered up then uncovered. There is a fair chance there is more.'

By this time the bands of hunter-gatherers of the Mesolithic had gradually evolved into an agricultural society . Bronze Age Britons were skilled at making tin and may have traded it with other far flung communities. They used to create elaborate jewellery, such as the delicate bracelet that was found. Other materials found at various sites - including amber beads - show that people traded internationally. A stone flint also discovered, showed that while people used bronze tools, there were also still using earlier tools, which again, would probably have been traded. High status individuals were revered and were buried in elaborate burial chambers with precious possessions.

The discovery was made on the Orkney Islands, (marked) an archipelago in northern Scotland situated around 10 miles (16km) north of the coast of Caithness . Ms Brown believes winter storms are the reason why the child (skeleton pictured) has since been uncovered. 'There have been heavy storms here over the last few months,' she said. 'Things get covered up then uncovered. There is a fair chance there is more'","An almost complete skeleton of a 4,000-year-old child has been found .
The discovery was made by walker Carrie Brown in Orkney, Scotland .
The skeleton was carefully removed from the grave on Sunday .

"Major US museums have banned selfie sticks because they say that the gadget is distracting patrons from the exhibits. Institutions like the Museum of Modern Art in New York are also fearful that the stick could lead to people damaging paintings. Curators have watched dozens of near misses as visitors shove the stick out in front of them, narrowly missing priceless works of art. Major US museums have banned the incredibly popular selfie sticks (pictured) because they say that the gadget is distracting patrons from the exhibits . Selfie sticks are extendable poles that clip onto smart phones and allow users to take a picture of themselves. They have become popular over the last year and among tourists who have used them to take pictures in places like the Eiffel Tower in Paris. But now there is a mounting backlash and in New York the Museum of Modern Art, the Cooper-Hewitt and the Smithsonian Design Museum have banned the gadget. The Guggenheim has also banned selfie sticks and the Metropolitan Museum of Art is reportedly considering a ban. Visitors are being told that the device falls under the umbrella of ‘additional equipment or devices other than handheld cameras’ that have long been prohibited. Curators have watched dozens of near misses as visitors shove the stick out in front of them, narrowly missing priceless works of art . Jennifer Northrup, a spokeswoman for the Cooper-Hewitt and Smithsonian Design Museum, said: ‘You can, just by looking at (it) imagine the havoc a selfie stick might wreak in this kind of space. ‘They could pose a danger to visitors or our objects on view’. Elsewhere in America the the Getty Center in Los Angeles and the Smithsonian’s Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington DC have banned selfie sticks as well. Julie Jaskol, the assistant director of media relations at Getty, said: ‘Selfie sticks are restricted out of concern about damaging the art or people in more enclosed spaces’. In the UK Tottenham Hotspur became the first Premiership football club to outlaw the gadget because it could be used as an ‘offensive weapon’. Arsenal followed suit soon after.","Selfie sticks have become increasingly popular with tourists and visitors .

"Not content with luring bargain-conscious shoppers away from the bigger supermarkets with cheap groceries and deli items, Lidl has also entered the worlds of fashion and beauty. Four years ago, the store's £4 perfume, Suddenly Madame Glamour, outshone Chanel’s £61 Coco Mademoiselle in a trial. Then in 2013, beauty experts raved about the brand’s £1.99 BB cream. And now, the German supermarket giant wants to style us for spring as it unveils a  fashion range that caters to 'savvy style hunters'. Scroll down for video . Cut-price supermaket Lidl has unveiled its spring fashion range, which FEMAIL writer Bianca London put to the test for a weekend away in the countryside. So, can you style a mini-break for under £50? Intrigued by a bargain, FEMAIL put the new range to the test on a weekend away in the countryside to ascertain whether you really can style a three-day break for £50. Following the sell-out success of its autumn fashion range in August 2014, Lidl's new collection, which hits stores on February 26, is inspired by Venice. Named See You in Venice, the range - which is the first of four  to launch this year - is full of Breton tops, jeggings and soft jersey dresses that can be dressed for day or night. For a country walk, the £4.99 jeggings, £5.99 pumps, £5.99 knit jumper and £15 trench work well, and for £25.98 for the whole look, Bianca was very impressed . For an al fresco lunch come spring, the £6.99 nautical dress, £15 trench coat and £5.99 pumps are ideal. The dress was very loose-fitted, which I preferred, but some people would no doubt rather a more fitted option . For lounging around the house, the £4.99 jeggings and £3.99 vests are ideal. The jeggings (jean leggings) are comfortable and come with an elasticated waistband. I opted for the blue vest because the white vest was slightly see-through so ensure you're wearing a neutral bra. This outfit can be dressed up for lunch with the girls by pulling on a £5.99 Breton top and slipping on the practical but stylish £5.99 ballerina pumps. I often find new pumps painful and they sometimes require 'breaking in' but these slipped on with ease. If lunch is a more formal affair, the £6.99 nautical dress teamed with the £14.99 trench coat works well. For me, the trench was the highlight of the range and while it's no Burberry coat, it was perfect for the warmer months and very well cut. Likewise, the £5.99 navy and cream knit jumper was comfortable and could easily become one of my wardrobe staples come spring. I wasn't keen on  the £6.99 red dress, which was far from flattering on my size 12 frame; teamed with the pumps, it did little to accentuate my figure . For dinner, the red dress wasn't quite smart enough for my liking but thanks to its jersey material and fit, it was comfortable, at least . Less successful was the £6.99 red dress, which was far from flattering on my size 12 frame. Plus, as someone who wears heels on a daily basis, the pumps did little for my silhouette so I'd like to see Lidl branch out with its footwear offering. Ultimately, it's cheap as chips. The best value item is a pair of black leggings, which are £2.99, and an entire outfit - including top, bottoms, coat and shoes - can be bought for under £30. Speaking about the range, a Lidl spokesperson said: 'As we see increased demand for fashion forward clothing at great value, it’s an exciting step for us to launch our second complete women’s fashion collection. 'With more choice than ever before, customers can purchase a whole outfit from us without the big price tag. Last year, items flew off the shelves within days of going on sale so we’d advise customers to get down to stores to snap up a bargain quick.' The final verdict? While I wouldn't rock head-to-toe Lidl, I would most certainly mix and match budget fashion gems, such as the trench coat, with a Zara blouse and trousers. The range essentially offers useful staples at an extraordinary price, even giving Primark a run for its money. Lidl will be adding four more drops to their clothing range - and sunglasses and statement necklaces make up the latest collection . The collection can be styled from day, left, to night, right, and no look will set you back more than £30 .","Budget chain Lidl's spring 14-piece range drops on 26 February .

"The final text of President . Barack Obama's request to Congress for authority to use . force against Islamic State fighters is still in the works as . talks with lawmakers continue, the White House said Tuesday. Obama . has said he would ask Congress for a formal Authorization to Use . Military Force (AUMF) for the fight, and White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday the administration will have language to the Congress 'relatively soon.' A source familiar with the extensive discussions between White House officials and lawmakers over the past month told Reuters 'the final text of the AUMF and timing for delivery will not . be locked until we are able to complete these robust . consultations and consider all of the feedback we have . received.' President Barack Obama will present Congress with a formal Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF) request 'relatively soon,' the White House said today . Lawmakers and congressional aides said they expected to . receive language from the White House as early as Wednesday . giving at least an outline of what the administration would like . to see in an authorization. Earnest said the text could come as early as this week but declined to give a specific date, telling reporters at his daily briefing, 'relatively soon would include any of the days that are remaining in this week.' Both Republicans and Democrats said there had been unusually close consultations between the administration and Capitol Hillon the Islamic State AUMF. A major concern in drafting the language, the White House said today, was making sure that it would have bipartisan support. The president believes the message sent by the resolution's passage will be 'even more powerful' if Democrats and Republicans alike stand behind it. The Obama administration official would preview the contents of the AUMF while acknowledging that it would fulfill the president's 'desire to see Congress act in support, or at least demonstrate their support for the strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.' A tight-lipped Josh Earnest said the text could come as early as this week but declined to give a specific date, telling reporters at his daily briefing, 'relatively soon would include any of the days remaining in this week' Kayla Mueller, 26, an American humanitarian worker from Prescott, Arizona is pictured in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters. Today U.S. President Barack Obama confirmed the death the U.S. aid worker who had been held hostage by Islamic State militants . Fueled by outrage over the death of aid worker Kayla . Mueller, the last-known U.S. hostage held by Islamic State . militants, as well as the slaying of journalists and a Jordanian . pilot, lawmakers say they planned quick hearings on the . authorization, and a vote within weeks of Congress' return from . a Feb. 16-20 recess. 'I think we ought to bring it to the floor relatively soon, . which I think we could do in March,' Representative Steny Hoyer, . the number two Democrat in the House of Representatives, told . reporters on Tuesday. John Cornyn, the number two Republican in the Senate, told . reporters he appreciated Obama's consultations. 'I think it's really an important step, and I think Congress . will treat it with the sort of  gravity and seriousness that it . deserves,' he told a news conference. The White House said it was 'hopeful' that Congress would pass the measure without delay. It also suggested that additional Americans may have been abducted by ISIS. Earnest admitted that 'at least' one more American was being held in captivity in the region - moments after using the plural term 'hostages.' In a statement confirming Mueller's death today, the president shared his condolences with her family. 'At this time of unimaginable suffering, the country shares in their grief,' he said, detailing Mueller's humanitarian work in communities around the world. 'Kayla’s compassion and dedication to assisting those in need shows us that even amongst unconscionable evil, the essential decency of humanity can live on,' Obama said. 'She epitomized all that is good in our world.' Continuing, the president said that Mueller's 'legacy endures, inspiring all those who fight, each in their own way, for what is just and what is decent' and promised to hunt down the terrorists who murdered her 'no matter how long it takes.' 'ISIL is a hateful and abhorrent terrorist group whose actions stand in stark contrast to the spirit of people like Kayla,' his statement said. 'On this day, we take comfort in the fact that the future belongs not to those who destroy, but rather to the irrepressible force of human goodness that Kayla Mueller shall forever represent.'","White House said text could come as early as this week but declined to give a specific date .

"A woman who turned her life around after beating drug addiction hanged herself just months after breaking up with her boyfriend of five years, an inquest heard. Shirley Jensen, who developed a drug habit as a teenager in Aberdeen, went on to gain a first-class degree and secure a job as a company manager after serving time in prison for drug possession in 1992. The 41-year-old, who had been teetotal for 20 years, was found dead in her flat in Stockport, Greater Manchester, last September after she failed to turn up at work. Determined: Shirley Jensen, pictured, who developed a drug habit as a teenager in Aberdeen, went on to gain a first-class degree and secure a job as a company manager after serving time in prison for drug possession . Tragic: The 41-year-old, pictured, who had been teetotal for more than a decade, was found dead in her flat in Stockport, Greater Manchester, last September after she failed to turn up for work . A book titled 'Letting Go', which offers advice on relationship boundaries following a separation, and a note which read 'I'm sorry', were found nearby. Her long-term relationship had ended in July when her boyfriend moved out of the  home they shared and she was in the process of looking for a flat of her own when she died. She had also recently started a new job after the company where she previously worked, owned by her mother, closed down. She told family and colleagues the pressure of the three situations had left her feeling 'stressed', Stockport Coroner's Court heard. Her mother, Winifred Barber, told the inquest her daughter had said: 'Three of the most stressful things that can happen to a person have happened to me at the same time - I've ended a relationship, started a new job and moved house.' Miss Jensen, who was hailed an 'inspirational colleague' by colleagues at the auction house where she worked, was found by police after she failed to turn up for work on September 29. The hearing was told Miss Jensen developed her drug habit after falling in with the wrong crowd at school and in 1992 she was jailed for six months for possession of Class A drugs. Respected: Miss Jensen, pictured, was hailed an 'inspirational colleague' by former co-workers . But when she was released after serving half her sentence, she vowed to get her life back on track and became teetotal at the age of 20 and went back to college to further her career and help others. Miss Jensen moved to Manchester where she got a job as a PA before enrolling at Manchester Metropolitan University where she graduated in Sociology with Information and Communications. She also used her past experiences to work with Narcotics Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous and the Citizens' Advice Bureau. The keen traveller also took part in charity runs. Miss Jensen's mother Winifred Barber, 63, told the Stockport hearing: 'One prison officer in the education department was trying to get her back on track and to realise her own potential. 'Despite that it hindered her. She wanted to be a mentor at a high school but they wouldn't let her. As far as we were aware she hadn't touched alcohol or drugs since she was 20 years old. 'She attended NA and AA and helped other women to get over their experience of drugs and alcohol. 'Despite her problem with her record she was always in regular employment or studying. She was never idle.' Miss Jensen went on a management training course before working as an office manager for her mother's auction company where colleagues said she was a 'dynamic and inspirational leader'. But when the company was closed down in July last year, Miss Jensen moved to a new job as an office manager with a property firm. It came at the same time as her five-year relationship was ending. Mrs Barber added: 'He moved out at the end of June/early July and the lease was due to expire on October 21 so she found a flat to move into on her own. 'I never found out why it ended and. I was saddened by the breakup.' 'She was seeing a counsellor on a weekly basis. She didn't try to keep it a secret but she didn't discuss with me what it was regarding. 'She always seemed to find a solution by discussing things with close friends, reading self-help books and she had used other counsellors in the past. She always tried to find a positive solution to any problem she had. Close: Miss Jensen with her 63-year-old mother, Winifred Barber. Mrs Barber told the inquest her daughter seemed upset but 'not distraught' when she last saw her on a family outing two days before her death . Dedicated: Miss Jensen, pictured, moved to Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan University where she graduated in Sociology with Information and Communications after being released from prison . Selfless: She also used her past experiences to work with Narcotics Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous and the Citizens' Advice Bureau. The keen traveller also took part in a number of charity runs . 'She said jokingly the three most stressful things that can happen to a person were all happening to her at the same time. 'She ended her relationship, started a new job and moved house. But she seemed to be taking it in her stride. She was enjoying the new job and the new challenge.' Mrs Barber said she last saw her daughter during a family outing to New Mills, Derbyshire on 27 September. She said Miss Jensen had seemed upset but 'not distraught'. Later, Mrs Barber text her daughter  saying 'I hope you feel better', and she replied she would, adding, 'love you'. Loving: Mrs Barber described her daughter, pictured, as a 'beautiful young woman' Two days later, she received a call from a friend of Miss Jensen who reported she hadn't been to work and there were concerns she had potentially had an accident. Miss Jensen's company had phoned the police and officers broke into the flat that evening. Concerns were raised when her manager said she was 'far too professional not to ring in'. Mrs Barber described how her daughter had left her bills placed neatly on the dining table. Mrs Barber added: 'The paperwork was found on the dining room table, cheques and details. It was all dated September 28. My belief was that she left that to help me to deal with her affairs after her death. She was even thoughtful at that traumatic time in her life.' Miss Jensen's GP, Dr Robert Mathewson, had been in contact with her since 1987. He reported early problems with alcohol and drugs and a referral to the alcohol team in 1995. She relapsed in 1999 and was suffering from depression, but was always reluctant to take anti-depressants, he said. The coroner John Pollard recorded a verdict of suicide. After the hearing, Mrs Barber said she had 'no idea whatsoever' why her daughter took her own life. She added: 'She was a very loving and beautiful young woman. I have great faith and a belief that I will meet her again one day and she will reveal all . 'They would have given her a slap on the wrist for her offence if it happened today. But it stayed permanent on her CRB check. 'A lot of other young people that are trying to turn their lives around can't because they have this block on it. 'I don't think it had a huge effect but when she was seeking to improve her education and in applications for certain jobs she knew it would come to the surface. She did very well in life after what happened.'","Shirley Jensen, 41, was found dead in her flat in Stockport last September .

"Looters are compounding the anguish of grieving relatives in  the MH17 massacre by using bank  cards and mobile phones stolen  from the dead. The shocking development emerged yesterday as emergency workers trying to reclaim missing body parts at the crash site were chased away by heavily-armed pro-Russian rebels accused of   downing the Malaysia Airlines flight. The Boeing 777 was destroyed by a missile killing all 298 people on board while flying over the separatist-held Donetsk region a week ago. Since then, the site has been one of astonishing chaos, with bodies looted, evidence sabotaged and valuable aluminium metal plane parts being stolen and sold for scrap. Scroll down for video . South African helicopter pilot Cameron Dalziel and his wife Reine recently moved to Malaysia with their two children . Cameron Dalziel was killed in the MH17 disaster . A man looks at the debris scattered at the crash site of the downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 . The crash site of MH17 in a field near the village of Grabove, in the Donetsk region . Yesterday, it emerged that the widow of one of the ten Britons killed had been forced to cancel her husband’s credit cards to stop their fraudulent use. Reine Dalziel, the wife of British helicopter pilot Cameron, a 43-year-old father-of-two, was ‘stunned’ by the shameful abuse of her dead husband’s belongings. Her brother Shane Hattingh said: ‘People are abusing it in the Ukraine. They have no respect for each other, look what they’re doing. It made me angry beyond words.’ Mr Dalziel, who had just moved to Malaysia with his family, was killed while on his way home after taking a training course. His wife was said to be ‘destroyed’ following his death.  Mr Hattingh said her whole body was ‘sore from crying’. He added: ‘The little we do know is that Cameron was in business class, and that particular part of the plane was found reasonably intact. ‘So we can only hope that things will work out for us and that we can get Cameron home and start the grieving process.’ Meanwhile, relatives have told of their horror after their loved ones’ phones were answered by strangers with ‘eastern European-sounding voices’. New footage also shows rebels stealing golden  wedding rings and other valuables from the scene. Yesterday, flights continued to carry victims’ bodies from the government-controlled Ukrainian city of Kharkiv to the Netherlands for identification. Poignant: Belongings lay scattered at the crash site near the village of Grabove as the first bodies from flight MH17 arrived in the Netherlands for identification . New evidence has also emerged that the rebels allegedly planned to sabotage the investigation by contaminating the site with parts from other planes . But forensic experts say just 200 corpses and an unspecified number of body parts have been sent to them by rebels from the crash site in the eastern farming village of Grabovo, which is unsecured and now largely deserted. There are fears that vital evidence has been lost as the site is sabotaged and plane debris – including the jet’s mangled cockpit – moved around and stolen to be sold as scrap metal. Remaining body parts have also been left to rot and destroyed by wild animals in the summer heat.Yesterday, the head of Ukraine’s emergency services, Serhiy Bochkovskiy, said officers were forced away from the site by the rebels who confiscated their equipment. Jan Tuinder, a forensics expert leading the Dutch investigation, said what was happening at the scene was ‘criminal.’ He added: ‘There are still some lunatics, it’s very hard for us to get to the bodies.’ Australia has sent a team of 50 policemen to London ready to fly out to try to recover remaining body parts. A toy belonging to a child who died in the downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 is pictured in a field near the village of Grabove, in the Donetsk region . Belongings of victims are pictured at the crash site of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in a field near Grabove . Toys in a bag are pictured at the crash site of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, in a field near the village of Grabove, in the Donetsk region . Rebels have promised secure access to the site for investigators but fighting was yesterday getting worse in the area. Meanwhile, a decree allegedly signed by rebel commander Igor Strelkov was issued stating that valuables taken from bodies must be handed in to contribute to the ‘defence fund’ of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. Jordan Withers, 22, the nephew of British crash victim Glenn  Thomas, 49, said: ‘It’s a hard one to swallow — that my uncle and everyone else’s loved ones are there and they are being degraded and treated inhumanely.’ Evidence of looting? The image appears to show a rebel fighter handling a gold ring amid the wreckage . Hunt for clues? A rebel fighter is filmed rifling through the bag of one of the 298 MH17 crash victims . Ukrainian government adviser Anton Gerashchenko yesterday said looters were stealing valuable aluminium from the site. Andrei Lysenko, of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, said: ‘The cynicism of these gangsters has no limits. According to our information, apart from picking up valuable personal belongings of the passengers, terrorists are using credit cards of the victims.’ Last night Ukrainian prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk announced his resignation following widespread criticism of his  government’s inability to secure the crash site. Wants jewellery for 'defence fund': An alleged decree by rebel commander Igor Strelkov (centre) appears to admit that the bodies of dead passengers on MH17 were looted by pro-Russian separatists . 'Valuable items must be sent to the DPR Defence Fund': The alleged order (above) is apparently signed by rebel army commander Colonel Igor Strelkov and carries what appears to be an official stamp . Children walk past a piece of wreckage from the MH17. Military analysts said the size, spread, shape and number of shrapnel impacts visible all point to a missile system like the SA-11 Buk as previously suspected . Long, sad journey home: Dutch police watch as a plane touches down carrying the bodies of crash victims from Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 at Eindhoven Airport . Contaminating the crime scene: A pro-Russian militant holds up a stuffed animal as others look on at the MH17 crash site which they have been accused of sabotaging in an attempt to hamper the investigation . Russia 'bears responsibility' for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, U.S. intelligence officials said, but they offered no evidence that Vladimir Putin was directly involved. The senior intelligence officials were cautious in their assessment, noting that while the Russians have been arming separatists in eastern Ukraine, the U.S. had no direct evidence that the missile used to shoot down the passenger jet came from Russia. The plane was probably shot down by an SA-11 surface-to-air missile fired by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, the intelligence officials said. U.S. intelligence chiefs have found no evidence of Vladimir Putin's direct involvement in the shooting down of MH17 but said Russia 'bears responsibility' for the disaster . They also said that after analysing taped phone conversations between separatists obtained by U.S. intelligence it could be all but concluded that the culprits did not realise they were targeting a commercial airliner. 'Five days into it [following the crash] it does appear to be a mistake,' one official said. The officials briefed reporters over intelligence related to last week's air disaster, which killed 298 people. It comes a day after the first pictures emerged of damaged panels from MH17, which appear to show evidence of shrapnel and missile damage. They cited intercepts, satellite photos and social media postings by separatists, some of which have been authenticated by U.S. experts. Separatists previously had shot down 12 Ukrainian military airplanes, the officials said . But the officials said they did not know who fired the missile or whether any Russian operatives were present at the missile launch. They were not certain that the missile crew was trained in Russia, although they described a stepped-up campaign in recent weeks by Russia to arm and train the rebels, which they say has continued even after the downing of the commercial jetliner. In terms of who fired the missile, 'we don't know a name, we don't know a rank and we're not even 100% sure of a nationality,' one official said. White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said the US was still working to determine whether the missile launch had a 'direct link' to Russia, including whether there were Russians on the ground during the attack and the degree to which Russians may have trained the separatists to launch such a strike. 'We do think President Putin and the Russian government bears responsibility for the support they provided to these separatists, the arms they provided to these separatists, the training they provided as well and the general unstable environment in eastern Ukraine,' he said in an interview with CNN. He added that heavy weaponry continues to flow into Ukraine from Russia following the downing of the plane.","South African helicopter pilot and father of two killed in MH17 tragedy .

"As a 17-year-old, Rob Washington was relieved to hear he didn't need his wisdom teeth removed. His dentist noted that the teeth were coming through at an angle, but said there was no point taking them out then as they weren't causing harm. 'He told me that the surgery would cause weeks of pain, so I was happy to wait, as he suggested, to see how they developed,' recalls Rob, now 31. And for years, this seemed the right approach: Rob had no pain and his dental check-ups were fine. Melody Barzin has suffered dental problems due to the current guidelines on extractions for wisdom teeth . Yet when he saw a dentist last summer, after a few years of missing check-ups, the molars next to both the wisdom teeth in his lower jaw had decayed and needed filling, possibly removing. All his wisdom teeth needed removing, too. 'The oral surgeon I was then referred to told me that 99 per cent of people with wisdom teeth coming through the way mine had would later develop tooth decay if they were left in,' says Rob, a lawyer from Hampshire who recently moved to Amsterdam. 'I hadn't realised it was inevitable, and was angry that I hadn't just had them removed before they damaged my other teeth.' Rob had his four wisdom teeth removed and is now getting a second opinion on whether his molars also need extracting. His experience is far from unusual, with experts saying that delays in removing wisdom teeth are leaving many people with more serious dental problems. Until 2000, it was routine to remove impacted wisdom teeth - 'impacted' being teeth that emerge at an angle or only partly emerge due to lack of space. Her dentist noticed one of her wisdom teeth was impacted but didn't refer her to get it extracted . Impacted wisdom teeth are actually a relatively modern problem. A couple of hundred years ago, our teeth wore away due to our rough diets, which created space at the back of the mouth for the wisdom teeth to come through (which is usually between ages 18 and 24). Softer diets have changed all this, says Louis McArdle, consultant oral surgeon at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and London Bridge Hospital. Impacted wisdom teeth are often jammed against the molar, making the space between the two teeth hard to clean, which leads to decay. This decay can progress rapidly because the teeth meet close to the pulp - the centre of the tooth which is made up of nerves, tiny blood vessels and connective tissue - says Luke Cascarini, a consultant oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the Wellington Hospital and Guy's Hospital, London. If the molar is badly decayed, then patients end up needing crowns, root canal treatment, or extraction - entirely needlessly, he says. The bacteria from the decay can also cause pain and infection. Extraction of wisdom teeth became routine from the Fifties, thanks to the introduction of power drills and antibiotics. By the mid-Nineties, every year about 70,000 people in England and Wales were having their wisdom teeth removed in hospital (as inpatients or day-cases). But in 2000, new guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) changed the rules so that only wisdom teeth causing problems - such as tooth decay, abscesses or cysts - should be removed. Extractions plummeted and by 2003 the figure had dropped to under 40,000. It saved the NHS money in the short term, but experts now believe this policy has caused patients more problems further down the line. This happened to Melody Barzin, 24, a psychology student who lives with her family in Central London. Three years ago, her wisdom teeth started coming through and her dentist noticed one was impacted. While he said it needed extracting, he didn't refer her to an oral surgeon - because there was no decay. Then, around a year ago, Melody started experiencing intermittent, intense pain in her lower jaw. 'I put up with it for months but then it became more constant. Eating was hard, and at times the pain woke me at night.' In January, she saw a dentist. An X-ray showed her impacted wisdom tooth had become infected and this had spread to the root of the molar beside it and near a nerve in her jaw. This put her at high risk of nerve damage which could cause loss of sensation in her bottom lip. Stories such as these help explain why the number of wisdom teeth extractions are now as high as they were before 2000, because the problem has simply been delayed and is consequently a bigger dental job, say experts. After a painful infection, Melody is having her two wisdom teeth removed this week and will then need root canal treatment on her molar . Indeed, official figures show that by 2010 almost 77,000 patients were having wisdom teeth removed - the highest level for 20 years. And this may be a gross underestimate, suggests Tara Renton, professor of oral surgery at King's College Hospital. She says up to 500,000 wisdom tooth extractions are now done on the NHS each year. Mr Cascarini says: 'Now, instead of patients being in their early 20s, they are in their 30s or 40s, and a lot of them also need the molar tooth in front of the wisdom tooth removed, which wouldn't have happened if they'd been removed earlier.' Being about ten years older increases the risk of pain, nerve injury and infection because we don't heal as well as we age, adds Professor Renton. 'There are fewer complications if they are removed before 25,' she says. Mr McArdle believes that NICE's intention of reducing costs by cutting wisdom teeth extractions - previously one of the most common surgical procedures done on the NHS - has been a false economy. 'It means there are now two problems to fix - the wisdom tooth and the tooth next to it.' After considering evidence from dental experts, NICE is considering updating its guidance. A spokesman said a decision is expected in the next few months. 'Most of the dental profession don't think NICE got it right with the 2000 guidelines,' says Mr McArdle. Professor Renton, who represents the dental arm of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, says it's vital not to introduce a blanket rule, and to consider carefully who needs the surgery because it has risks, such as pain, bleeding, infection, nerve injury, and, in rare cases, jaw fracture. On average, it costs £150 on the NHS if done under local anaesthetic, and more for sedation or general anaesthetic. Privately, it costs up to £2,000. If the dentist sees an impacted wisdom tooth, the patient should be referred to an oral surgeon. The surgeon will take X-rays to see if the tooth is crossing the trigeminal nerve which runs around the jaw. The proportion of people who have a phobia about dentists . The procedure is one of the higher risk dental surgeries for causing permanent nerve damage to the lip and tongue, she explains. About 2 per cent of patients will experience temporary nerve injury, and 0.2 per cent will have permanent damage, but these risks increase tenfold when the tooth crosses the nerve canal. 'Injuries to the nerve can't always be avoided, so patients need to be well informed and find experienced surgeons,' says Professor Renton. 'Permanent nerve damage can ruin lives, with numbness, odd sensations and pain.' Based on X-rays and scans, the surgeon will decide whether to remove all or half of the tooth. Several techniques are used. Professor Renton recommends a minimal access method, where little bits of tooth are removed using a drill, leaving most of the tooth root in the gum. She says this way minimises risks and damage, but it requires a lot of training. Some surgeons remove the whole tooth in one go or in fewer sections using a drill or chisels. People who report having wisdom teeth 'yanked out' using dental forceps should be in the minority now, she says. Melody is having her two wisdom teeth removed this week and will then need root canal treatment on her molar. 'If I'd been told the complications that could occur from leaving wisdom teeth in, much of this could have been prevented,' she says.","Melody Barzin has suffered dental problems due to extractions guidelines .

"A Pennsylvania family is suing Babies R Us and a New Jersey furniture manufacture for more than $350,000 over a dresser which fell on two toddler sisters and crushed them to death last July 4. According to TimesOnline, a wrongful death lawsuit filed in Beaver County court alleges the drawers that crushed Ryeley, three, and Brooklyn Beatty, two, were 'improperly designed for use in a child’s environment'. The suit also claims the product - weighing 124lbs - did not have an 'anchoring strap' to prevent it from falling. It was manufactured by Baby Cache Inc. of Piscataway. Victims: Brooklyn Beatty, left, and Ryeley Beatty, right, died after a dresser reportedly fell on top of them . Source of the problem: Authorities were seen removing the dresser similar to this product found on Babies R Us webpage from the scene . The girls' mother, Jennifer Beatty, and grandmother, Pamela Warnick, apparently purchased the item from a Babies R Us store in Cranberry in early 2010. It was a shop floor model that was being sold on clearance. Attorney Deborah DeCostro alleges the dresser was 'improperly packaged and/or boxed at the time it was sold' and did not come labeled with  safety warnings. A Babies' R Us employee is also said to be facing allegations for not alerting Beatty and Warnick to the 'faults'. Officials from the retailer and the dresser company didn't immediately respond to the Associated Press seeking comment on the lawsuit. The dresser fell on Ryeley and Brooklyn in their Aliquippa home on July 4 2014. Brooklyn died that day and Ryeley two days later. It was reported that the sisters had been playing in or around the bottom drawer of the dresser, causing it to fall onto them. They were home alone with their father, 28-year-old David Beatty, at the time. Tragic accident: An autopsy doctor testified that the girls could have been saved had their father helped them immediately after hearing the dresser crash down . Deadly: Authorities were seen removing the dresser at the scene . He and his wife are currently facing charges of child endangerment. Authorities described the condition of their home at the time of the dresser incident as 'deplorable' with clothing, trash, dog  and human feces strewn about. David Beatty was also facing two counts of involuntary manslaughter but these charges have since been dropped following a hearing in January. It was said that he didn't immediately respond to his daughters after hearing a bang. An autopsy doctor testified that the girls could have been saved had he helped them immediately after hearing the  crash. However, Beatty’s defense attorney, Kevin Kindred, argued he did not consciously disregard a dangerous situation. He described it as a 'tragic accident' adding that the home's condition was being unfairly linked to the deaths.

"A pilot from New York believes he has found the wreckage of the missing Malaysia Airline Flight 370 off the coast of Thailand after searching thousands of satellite images online. Michael Hoebel, 60, spent hours trawling through the images made available to the public on a crowd-sourcing website, TomNod.com, before coming across what he believes is the doomed plane. The recreational pilot from Tonawanda said he was shocked to discover that the aircraft, which vanished two months ago, appeared to be in one piece beneath the water off the northeast coast of Malaysia, just west of Songkhla in Thailand. The image was taken days after the crash. Scroll down for video . Is it the wreckage? Michael Hoebel is pictured showing an image of what he believes is the wreckage of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. He found the image on a website that shares satellite images . 'The perfect size': He said he used a scale given by the website and compared it to the specifications listed on Boeing's website - and discovered that the figure in the water was the right size . Discovery: He said that the lighter markings on the image matched up with the design of the plane . He told WIVB that . he used the scale at the bottom of the map on TomNod and compared them . to the specs on Boeing's website to establish that the white figure he . saw was the perfect size. 'I was taken aback because I couldn't believe I would find this,' he told the news channel. Where is the plane? A map shows where Hoebel believes the plane is, compared to its intended flight (red line) and suspected flight path (in blue) He pointed to the image on his computer as he explained why he thought it was the missing airliner. 'The lighter skin where the wing attaches to the fuselage - you see that lighter skin,' he said, comparing the grainy image to a photograph of the make of plane. And when WIVB reporter Ed Drantch questioned if the shadow could be a shark, Hoebel responded: 'That's a 210ft shark.' TomNod allows members of the public to go through millions of satellite pictures in a bid to help investigate the crash. It also . allows other users to rate whether or not they agree with another user's . theory - and so far, no one has disagreed with Hoebel's, he said. No . one else has noted finding the wreckage at the same spot, he added.

Certain: Hoebel said he looked through thousands of satellite images to find the potential wreckage . Hobby: The recreational pilot, 60, said that he felt deeply for the families who have lost their loved ones . Instead, the search will enter a new phase with the focus on the ocean floor - despite there being no 'pings' from what was earlier hoped were the aircraft's black boxes. Mr Abbott said that as the aircraft, which had 239 people on board, has been missing for 52 days, if there had been any debris from the aircraft it would have now sunk. Malaysia's Prime Minister, Mr Najib Razak, has also conceded that investigators have made no substantial progress since March 8 - the date that the plane is believed to have crashed.

The family was found dead beneath towels and blankets in the bathroom of their west Houston home on February 2 after they failed to attend church - but authorities believe they had been murdered nearly a week before. Their oldest son allegedly beat his parents to death with a baseball bat, a lamp and a hammer, and stabbed his little brother in the back and neck with a kitchen knife. The young boy's body was found in the bathtub, KPRC reported. Rugs inside the apartment had been moved to hide blood stains, and there were other signs that the bodies had been moved or dragged, according to court documents. Tiharihondi had told friends and family that he had joined the Marines and was leaving at the end of the month - but the couple's middle son, 17-year-old Emmanuel, who was at school in California, said that when he last spoke to his mother on January 27, she had indicated that they didn't believe Isaac and were going to confront him about it.

"New research has found that as humans we all have a tendency to look on the bright side of life . If you are struck down by the winter blues, take heart, for things will soon start to feel better. Not only is spring on the way, but new research has concluded that as humans we all have a tendency to look on the bright side of life. A large study of languages spoken across the globe revealed that optimism is ingrained in human nature. Scientists from Australia and the US studied the 100,000 most-common words used in the world’s ten most-spoken languages. Using mathematical analysis, they found that no matter their culture, people are far more likely to use positive words than negative ones. The study, which looked at the most popular words used in newspapers, books, films, the internet and on the Twitter social media site, found that humans have a natural tendency to look at life with a cheerful slant. Dr Lewis Mitchell, from the University of Adelaide, said: ‘Happiness is obviously important, but tough to define and measure. ‘We want to be able to do this in a data-driven, open-source way, so that both the public and policymakers can consult these metrics on a daily basis, as they might interest rates or stock tickers.’ He added: ‘It doesn’t matter whether it’s English, Spanish, Russian or Chinese ─ the words that make up our languages are universally biased towards positive emotions.’ The researchers analysed the 10,000 most spoken words in each of ten languages - English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Indonesian, Chinese, Korean and Russian. They asked native speakers to rate whether those words were ‘happy’ or ‘sad’ on a 1 to 9 scale. The results, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last night (Monday), revealed a positive slant in the way in which humans communicate, no matter the language. The study of languages spoken across the globe revealed optimism is ingrained in human nature. File photo . Even though all ten languages were positively biased, there were some differences between them - Spanish and Portuguese were the ‘happiest’ and Chinese, Korean and Russian were the ‘saddest’. The research provides evidence which backs up the ‘Polyanna hypothesis’ which holds that the human subconscious naturally leans towards optimism. It also explains previous research which shows that people often expect too much out of life. For example, we know that around 50 per cent of marriages end in divorce, but even people who have had a number of failed marriages continue to tie the knot again. This tendency, which psychologists call the ‘triumph of hope over experience’, means we also tend to think we will live longer and be more successful than average, and underestimate our likelihood of having cancer.","Scientists studied the 100,000 most-common words used in ten languages .

"An 18-year-old student who fell asleep during a taxi ride home after a night out, found himself invited into the driver's house. Mike Allison, from Northwich, Cheshire, had been celebrating a friend's birthday in Manchester earlier this month and was mistakenly left behind as the group got out of the ride home. When the driver discovered the A-level student at the back of his minibus at 4.30am, he kindly offered some warmth for the teenager. Hero driver: Student Mike Allison posted this picture, captioned: 'Fell asleep in the taxi and none woke me up. Now I'm back at the taxi man's house in Stretford watching take me out (sic).' Mr Allison and his friends had enjoyed a night of celebration in Deansgate, and had arranged for a minibus to pick them up, arriving home at around 4am. However, Mr Allison's friends failed to see that he was still left in the taxi, so the sleeping teen remained in the vehicle until the driver got home to Stretford, more than 20 miles away. 'I looked around and couldn't see anyone, and so thought one of my drinks had been spiked and that I had been kidnapped or something!,' the student told Buzzfeed. 'The taxi driver was still in the front at this point, so I shouted up to him, asking where the hell we were.' Mr Allison did not want to pay the £50 fee to be driven back to Northwich, so the kind driver offered to let him wait inside his home while he arranged a lift back. Struggle: Mr Allison, pictured right, was offered tea and food by the kind taxi driver after his misfortune . 'So I go into his house, and he offers me a brew and some food. I stayed there for about an hour watching Take Me Out.' Mr Allison posted a picture of the  strange twist of fate on his Twitter, a snap which has since gone viral. 'Fell asleep in the taxi and none woke me up. Now I'm back at the taxi man's house in Stretford watching take me out(sic),' the teenager wrote. Unfortunately for the A-level student, his night did not end when he left the driver's house. Mr Allison, who hopes to study real estate at university next year, told MailOnline, After I left his house at 5.30am, it took me another two hours to find my lift home because my phone died.'","Mike Allison, 18, fell asleep in the minibus home from a night out .

"Cousins and lovers murdered a man after he urinated on their bathroom floor and wrapped his body in cling wrap before burying him, a court has heard. First cousins Jason Wiremu Hiroki and Aroha Hiroki are accused of killing 45-year-old Nick Katopodis after an evening of drinking at the couple's home in Wollongong on July 27, 2011. First cousins Jason Wiremu Hiroki and Aroha Hiroki are accused of killing 45-year-old Nick Katopodis (pictured) after an evening of drinking at the couple's home in Wollongong on July 27, 2011 . 'The crown case is that Jason and Aroha Hiroki were jointly responsible for the death of Nick Katopodis, that they were part of a joint criminal enterprise to commit an act that at least was intended to inflict grievous bodily harm,' crown prosecutor Tony McCarthy said in his opening address in the Supreme Court on Tuesday. Mr Katopodis' body was found buried underneath the couple's home in early 2013. The coroner was unable to determine a cause of death, but noted there were three small fractures on his skull, a broken bone in his left arm and that he had the plastic from a six pack of beer in his mouth. The jury was told that after drinking with the couple and a friend during the day, Mr Katopodis went back to their house to continue partying. Later, Jason found a heavily intoxicated Mr Katopodis urinating on the floor of the bathroom and punched him, knocking him out. The car that murdered 45-year-old man Nick Katopodis was last seen in . Mr Katopodis later went down to the couple's dining room. It was the last time he was seen alive. The crown alleges Mr Katopodis' body was moved to a shed behind the house, wrapped in cling wrap and taken on a skateboard to be buried. His body was found 19 months later and police found blood splatters on the wall and ceiling of the couple's dining room. The couple told police different versions of their story and tried to blame each other, Mr McCarthy told the court. It is also alleged Jason asked a friend about burying a body, telling him 'he wouldn't get off my missus'. Jason's barrister, Janet Manuell SC, asked the jury to put to one side the couple's dysfunctional relationship, and said Aroha would try to paint Jason as abusive. Both Jason and Aroha Hiroki have pleaded not guilty to murder. They are on trial in the NSW Supreme Court . 'We say she was not scared at all,' Ms Manuell said. Aroha's barrister, Ragni Mathur, described Jason Hiroki as a man of violence and said Mr Katopodis died after being king-hit while in the bathroom. Aroha told police Jason Hiroki killed Mr Katopodis with a beer bottle, before threatening her, the court heard. Jason told police that when Mr Katopodis died he was asleep 'on the wacky tabaccy' and that Aroha said she hit Mr Katopodis after he 'came onto her'. Jason has pleaded guilty to being an accessory to murder after the fact. Both Jason and Aroha Hiroki have pleaded not guilty to murder. The couple sat separately in court. The trial continues.","First cousins and lovers accused of killing 45-year-old Nick Katopodis .

"An inquiry into the way MPs police sleaze in the Commons was branded a whitewash last night. The seven-month review by the Commons standards committee found that MPs should continue to sit in judgment on colleagues accused of breaking parliamentary rules. Critics warned the plans would let MPs continue to ‘mark their own homework’. Scroll down for video . Very funny: A seven-month review by the Commons standards committee found that MPs should continue to sit in judgment on colleagues accused of breaking parliamentary rules . The standards committee is the final arbiter of alleged wrongdoing by MPs. In the past it has frequently been accused of taking a lenient approach, particularly against senior figures. Under the new plans half of its members will be drawn from outside Westminster for the first time. The move will result in the number of ‘lay’ members increasing from three to seven. But, controversially, these lay members will still not be given a vote on the committee’s decisions, meaning that MPs will retain the final say. The report found there were ‘strong constitutional reasons’ why MPs needed to remain the final arbiter on whether rules had been broken and what punishments should be enforced. But Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the committee on standards in public life, warned the ‘very modest’ reforms would fail to convince the public that MPs have cleaned up their act. ‘They have chickened out of addressing the real issue of accountability,’ he said. ‘All other professions have a majority of lay members and are chaired by lay members. I can see no reason why the same arrangements should not apply to MPs. But on their committee the lay members do not even have a vote, and that will not change under these proposals. ‘It is a very modest change indeed, and I’m afraid it will not persuade people that MPs have understood the problem and got to grips with it.’ Labour MP John Mann, who has campaigned for sweeping reforms of the system, said the plans did not go nearly enough. ‘The idea that MPs will continue to sit in judgment on each other will be complete anathema to most people,’ Mr Mann said. ‘The public are very clear that they do not want us marking our own homework, and they are right about that. ‘We do not need MPs adjudicating on cases that have already been investigated by the independent commissioner – all it does is fuel public suspicion that some sort of fix is going on. ‘These reforms will not satisfy public opinion. What will happen is that there will be another controversial case where this committee intervenes, and the reputation of parliament will be dragged through the mud again.’ Sovereign body: The report found there were ‘strong constitutional reasons’ why MPs needed to remain the final arbiter on whether rules had been broken and what punishments should be enforced . The review was launched last year following criticism of the committee’s decision to throw out a demand from parliamentary standards commissioner Kathryn Hudson that former culture secretary Maria Miller should repay £45,000 in expenses for over-claiming on her mortgage. The committee slashed the repayment demand to £5,800, saying Mrs Hudson had interpreted the rules on claiming for mortgages too strictly. It argued that although Mrs Miller was technically in breach she had behaved ‘reasonably’. Sir Kevin Barron , Labour chairman of the Commons standards committee, said last year that lay members of the committee should be allowed to vote to improve public confidence. But yesterday he said it had proved legally difficult. He suggested lay members would wield greater influence by not having a vote as they would retain the right to publish their disagreements with any decision taken by the committee. He said: ‘The lay members – okay, they don’t have a vote, but they do have a voice.’ Sir Kevin said it would be ‘disproportionate’ to introduce fully independent regulation of 650 MPs. And he insisted that his committee ‘is not a committee that looks after MPs – we don’t let people off’. Former attorney-general Dominic Grieve said parliament would have to ‘re-write the UK constitution’ to allow outsiders to rule on the conduct of MPs. Mrs Hudson said all new MPs would be given anti-sleaze lessons after the election to help them stick to the rules. But she said that plans for a new code of conduct had been stalled by parliament since 2012.","Critics warn plans would let MPs continue to ‘mark their own homework’

On Friday  two of the gang, who cannot be named, were found guilty of taking part in the violence at Wolverhampton Crown Court. A 16-year-old boy was found guilty of possessing an imitation firearm with intent while a 17-year-old was found guilty of possessing a knife. Two teenagers have previously admitted their involvement in the incident which was caught on camera at an earlier court hearing. Nathaniel Nugent, 18, from Blurton, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, admitted possession of a knife and affray in August last year. The innocent girls were part of a group who had just arrived in the city to enjoy a night out but found themselves thrust into the middle of the gangland row . The injured girl was taken to hospital with back and leg injuries alongside a teenage boy who was treated for stab wounds . A 16-year-old boy. from Wolverhampton, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to possession of a hammer and affray. The four teenagers, who were granted bail, are all facing jail when they are sentenced next month. During the trial, Philip Beardwell, prosecuting, described the brawl as 'a very serious and ugly incident of public disorder'. The court heard how a group of five girls heading for a night out in the city after arriving at the bus station were enveloped by the youths fighting in the street. The 17-year-old was seen waving a knife around moments before the girls heard a gunshot. The 16-year-old was then seen with what appeared to be a firearm that was then pointed at three of the girls. Two of the group are then filmed calmly leaving the three star hotel shortly after as onlookers rush to help the two injured females as they lie in the street . On Friday two of the gang, who cannot be named, were found guilty of taking part in the violence at Wolverhampton Crown Court . Giving evidence, a 17-year-old girl said she had seen a group of around 15 youths running towards the Prince Albert pub and then back towards the Britannia Hotel . Neither the knife nor the gun was found but a blank bullet casing was recovered from the scene. Mr Beardwell said it could not be proved that a real gun was involved and added 'but you can be sure that it was at least an imitation firearm.' Giving evidence, a 17-year-old girl said she had seen a group of around 15 youths running towards the Prince Albert pub and then back towards the Britannia Hotel. She told the court: 'One of them came towards one of my friends who was standing behind me.' 'He was swinging a hammer and shouting threats at my friend. 'He said he was going to hit her with the hammer. I am sure he said he was going to kill her. 'As he raised the hammer in the air I grabbed his arm. 'We were pushing each other and I dropped to the floor. As that happened one of his friends kicked me hard in the ribs knocking the breath our of me. 'Then the youth with the hammer who had fallen over with me got up and hit me with it on the spine quite hard. 'I was curled up in a ball and stayed there for five or 10 minutes.' Witness Mark Tobin, deputy manager of the Britannia Hotel, told the court: 'A boy about 15 to 16-years-old came from the direction of the Prince Albert Pub. The court heard how a group of five girls heading for a night out in the city after arriving at the bus station were enveloped by the youths fighting in the street outside the hotel (file picture) 'I heard him say in a local accent, 'Get here blud, you've had it - I'm going to get you'. 'He was holding a lump hammer. 'He held it in his left hand by his leg. I thought something was about to happen. 'He was about 20ft to 30ft away. I saw two females and around 12 males just outside the restaurant. They looked 14 to 18-years-old. 'As I came closer, I heard lots of shouting and screaming. I can't recall what was being said. I saw a male swinging a hammer around aggressively. 'He grabbed one of the females with his left hand by her hair. 'He was swinging her around by her hair trying to get her to the floor. He was swinging the hammer around but I couldn't tell if it hit her. She was trying to fight him off. 'Another male had his hand up and something black was in his hand but I couldn't see what it was. 'I heard a bang which was like a firearm. 'It was a similar sound to when I have been clay pigeon shooting. There was smoke.' They four will be sentenced at the same court on March 6.","Gun fired and a teenage girl was struck with a hammer as children watched .

"When Nikki Scott lost her husband and the father of her two oldest children, Corporal Lee Scott, during a tour to Afghanistan in July 2009  she thought she would never experience happiness again. But five years on, Nikki is remarried to military man Joe Howlin, who served in Afghanistan alongside her late husband, and she gave  birth to their first baby together just 12 days ago. Speaking on ITV's Lorraine ahead of the  documentary Young War Widows, which airs tonight, the 33-year-old described her mixed emotions at her new-found happiness: 'It’s hard because I sometimes feel guilty – I love two men. Sometimes my head gets a bit messed up. Nikki lost her husband in Afghanistan  in 2009 and says the hardest part was telling her children . She added: 'But  I know I’m lucky. I have two amazing husbands. It's good to finally be in good place.' Nikki told Lorraine Kelly that despite finding love again her late husband is always in her thoughts: 'I keep Lee’s memory alive every day. 'My children say, ""I have one daddy in heaven looking down on us and Jo at home doing all the daddy things"".' 'Joe was out in Afghanistan with Lee. I didn’t know Joe then, but Lee did so Joe can tell the kids what it was like.' In a clip from tonight's documentary the war widow was seen fighting back tears as she paid tribute to her late husband. Nikki Scott with her late husband Corporal Lee Scott and their two children, Kai (top) then five and  Brooke (bottom) who was only a few months old in the picture . Nikki  remarried military man Joe, above, who served in Afghanistan alongside her late husband. She gave birth to baby Tilly just 12 days ago . She said: 'He’d just turned 26 and was full of life. He loved his family. He loved the Army but he loved his kids.' Remembering the last time she spoke to her husband over five years ago, the mother-of three said: 'He was saying, ""I love you, I miss you"" and it was all about, ""When I get back think about what do you want to do"". It was all, ""What have you been doing?"". 'He also did say, ""This is the worst tour I've ever done. This is like nothing I've ever done before. I'm signing off when I come back. It’s not worth it."" 'For Lee to tell me that I knew it was bad because he usually would not have told me anything.' Five days later, Nikki was greeted by Army officials as she returned from a walk with a friend. 'I saw two cars outside the house and I was crying walking down the street. I knew those cars were for me. I thought, ""Lee’s been hurt.""' Sadly she was informed of graver news. Her husband had been killed in a roadside explosion. Nikki recalls last conversation with husband in Afghanistan on the couch with Lorraine Kelly . Nikki said that despite finding love again her late husband is always in her thoughts . 'I thought my life was over,' she said and says the hardest part was breaking the news to her son, Kai, who was five at the time. At seven months old, her daughter Brooke was too young to understand. 'I  had to be straight and clear so I didn't get his hopes up,' she said. 'But it's devastating to see your kids cry. You hug them but you can't make it better.' 'I think that was the hardest part - to tell Kai.' Her daughter Brooke, now six, sleeps with a picture of the beloved father she never knew under her pillow. The 33-year-old described her mixed emotions at her new-found happiness: 'It’s hard because I sometimes feel guilty – I love two men' 'She is very emotional that she can't remember her daddy,' Nikki explained. Choking back tears the mother remembered: 'In the evening when the kids were in bed was the worst because then I had time to think. 'I never thought I'd turn that corner,' she said. It was only when she took Kai on holiday in the aftermath of the tragedy and saw him laugh again that she realised how badly he'd been affected - and felt motivated to live life again for the sake of her children's happiness. 'That's when we set up Scotty's Little Soldiers, which supports kids who have lost a parent in the British armed forces. 'We are now supporting 200 children - and keeping Lee’s memory alive.'

"Domestic violence charges were abruptly dropped on Monday against Carolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy after his accuser could not be found to testify, prosecutors said. District attorneys wanted his his ex-girlfriend, Nicole Holder, to testify at his jury trial slated to begin in Charlotte on Monday. He was accused of assaulting Holder and threatening to kill her. However, Holder has eluded all law enforcement authorities' attempts to contact--and subpoena--her since November while leaving a trail of Facebook travel photos from the Rocky Mountains to Midtown Manhattan. Couldn't find the victim: Domestic charges have been dropped against Carolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy (left) after his ex-girlfriend Nicole Holder (right) failed to cooperate with law enforcement officials . According to prosecutors, Holder reached a civil settlement of undisclosed terms well before the trial. If Holder's Facebook photos are any indication, the former cocktail waitress has found a way to move on. Hardy, a five-year NFL veteran, was found guilty by a district court judge in July but, under North Carolina law, appealed the verdict and was then allowed to have a jury trial. According to the Charlotte Observer, Holder left her job at the nightclub Suite in Charlotte sometime in August. By November, the DA's office had lost contact with her. On December 8, she photographed herself dining at a Denver, Colorado restaurant. Next, on that same day, she posted photos of her self snowmobiling in the posh resort town of Vail. On December 22, she posted photos as she shopped at a high end Atlanta mall. Holder, who police in May said was taken to the emergency room following an altercation with Hardy, stopped contacting prosecutors in November and by December had embarked on a cross-country leisure tour . Jet set: On December 8, she photographed herself dining at a Denver, Colorado restaurant before heading to Vail that same day . The following day, she was posing for photo in New York City's Grand Central Station. 'The victim appears to have intentionally made herself unavailable to the state,' the District Attorney's Office said in a statement. 'Without her testimony in this particular instance, the state could not proceed.' The National Football League placed Hardy on the commissioner's exempt list in September, meaning he was taken off the field but continued to receive his $13.1 million salary. Hardy's suspension will remain in effect until the matter is reviewed, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said after the case was dismissed. Several of the NFL's top players, including Adrian Peterson and Ray Rice, were charged with domestic violence in 2014, prompting the league to overhaul its personal conduct policy. Sharply criticized for being too lenient on domestic violence and sexual assault, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell made the penalties for such crimes much harsher than in the past. Holder worked as a cocktail waitress until around August. Before Hardy's most recent trial date, he and Holder reached a civil settlement that prosecutors believe centered on the alleged assault . After spending a day shopping at a high end Atlanta mall December 22, Holder was photographed in Manhattan's Grand Central Station the following day . Hardy, a 2013 Pro Bowler who played only one game for the Panthers before being suspended last season, will become a free agent next month and it was uncertain if Carolina would re-sign the former sixth-round draft choice out of Mississippi. 'Greg remains on the commissioner's exempt list and the NFL has advised us to allow it to complete its review under the Personal Conduct Policy,' the Panthers said in a statement. 'There is no change in his status at this time.' He was accused of assaulting Holder at his Charlotte condominium in May, sending her to the hospital emergency room. Prosecutors said when she last spoke with them in November, Holder told them that she 'did not want to participate in another trial.' Hardy, wearing a dark suit and white tennis shoes, left the Mecklenburg County Courthouse without speaking to reporters.

"This is the first picture of the Ukrainian air force pilot alleged by pro-Russian rebels to have been the 'executioner' of the 298 victims on board doomed Malaysian Airlines flight MH17. The Russian Investigative Committee - equivalent of the FBI - is calling for Captain Vladislav Voloshin to take a lie-detector test and face formal questioning, asserting there is compelling evidence against him which should be considered by the Dutch-led official probe. Believed to be in his late 20s, he was named by stems from a 'secret witness' at his Dnipropetrovsk air base who says the pilot took off in his Su-17 combat jet on 17 July last year armed with air-to-air missiles. Scroll down for video . This is the first picture of the Ukrainian air force pilot alleged by pro-Russian rebels to have been the 'executioner' of the 298 victims on board doomed Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 . He returned without them soon after the Boeing 777 was blasted out of the sky, it is alleged. After landing Voloshin was 'scared', muttering that the incoming 'aircraft' - supposedly MH17 - 'was in the wrong place at the wrong time', according to the unnamed Ukrainian serviceman, now under guard at a secret location in Russia. The Investigative Committee, headed by Alexander Bastrykin, a former classmate of Vladimir Putin, insists that the witness has passed a polygraph test and his testimony is credible. The Russian Investigative Committee - equivalent of the FBI - is calling for Captain Vladislav Voloshin to take a lie-detector test and face formal questioning, asserting there is compelling evidence against him which should be considered by the Dutch-led official probe . Volshin has not spoken directly on the loss of MH17 but denied through his superiors that he was responsible. Ukraine blames Russia for a crude propaganda stunt in naming him. Since the horror, Moscow has repeatedly claimed that MH17 was shot down by a Ukrainian warplane in the skies close to the Malaysian plane, while also vigorously denying the West's analysis that it was hit by a BUK missile fired by pro-Moscow rebels. The pro-Moscow rebel media in eastern Ukraine has already branded Voloshin as 'the pilot who shot down MH17', showing archive footage of him which it labels 'the future executioner'. Believed to be in his late 20s, he was named by stems from a 'secret witness' at his Dnipropetrovsk air base who says the pilot took off in his Su-17 combat jet on 17 July last year armed with air-to-air missiles . The Investigative Committee, headed by Alexander Bastrykin, a former classmate of Vladimir Putin, insists that the witness has passed a polygraph test and his testimony is credible . 'Let Voloshin take a lie-detector test with Dutch or Malaysian experts,' demanded Investigative Committee's spokesman Vladimir Markin. 'Representatives of the Russian Investigative Committee are ready to leave for Ukraine at short notice with all necessary equipment for testing pilot Voloshin and all others who might know anything about the crash.' He demanded that the Ukrainian military should make a full disclosure of its flight logs on 17 July, the day MH17 was shot down, and allow Russia to interrogate its air traffic controllers. Referring to Ukrainian secret services, he said: 'We're waiting for a response from the SBU.' SBU official Markiyan Lubkivskyi insisted Voloshin was not engaged in combat flights on 17 July, the day MH17 was downed, and had not used weapons against aerial targets in the current conflict. Voloshin denied he had shot down MH17, and had no idea why the allegation was being taken seriously in Russia . 'The officer made no flights that day, and his aircraft was under repair because of damage inflicted during landing on 16 July,' he said, accusing Moscow of a bid to 'discredit' Ukraine. Voloshin denied he had shot down MH17, and had no idea why the allegation was being taken seriously in Russia, he said. The pilot has not spoken directly to the media over the incident. Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, Oleksandr Turchynov, accused Moscow of using propaganda to 'hide the crimes organised by the Russian Federation, including against civilians' in relation to flight MH17. He said: 'A great deal of evidence, including data from satellite observation, has proved that terrorist groups controlled by the Russian military shot down the passenger aircraft'. Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, Oleksandr Turchynov, accused Moscow of using propaganda to 'hide the crimes organised by the Russian Federation, including against civilians' in relation to flight MH17 . They used 'a Russian BUK surface-to-air-missile system', he said. But Moscow is now poised to give its 'whistleblower' sanctuary under its witness protection programme, so preventing him being prosecuted in Ukraine, it is understood. 'As the witness may be in danger, investigators are considering providing him with state protection,' said Markin. He already has a pseudonym 'in the interests of his security'. 'The facts and information that the witness possessed and shared - clearly and without getting confused - convince the investigators that his testimony is truthful, something that, by the way, a polygraph test has confirmed,' said Markin. Six weeks after the MH17 crash, Voloshin's plane was shot down over eastern Ukraine. He ejected, and escaped from the rebel-held region . He 'personally' saw Voloshin's warplane 'loaded with R-60 type air-to-air missiles, with which Su-25 fighters were not normally equipped'. His aircraft returned without these missiles. Markin claimed the account supported other witnesses who testified that 'not long before the crash they saw a warplane in the air in close proximity to the passenger airliner.' He said that 'the Investigative Committee will continue gathering and analysing all information about the disaster. 'If members of an international commission investigating the crash are indeed interested in finding out the truth and decide to request information from us, we are ready to share all available data.'

"Eleven passenger planes were forced to make Mayday calls to land at UK airports last year because they were running low on fuel, it has emerged. New figures reveal that a total of 11 planes had to radio an emergency call to schedule an earlier landing because fuel supplies on the aircraft were so low. A further 100 passenger jets were also caught 'flying on empty', but they didn't have to make Mayday calls, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) figures show. It means a total of 111 planes ended up running low on fuel during flights in 2014 – almost double the 58 British-registered planes which recorded low fuel levels in 2013. New figures show that a total of 111 commercial planes were caught flying low on fuel in UK airspace last year, with 11 of those planes being forced to issue a Mayday call to land because of low fuel levels (file picture) However, in comparison, the number of Mayday calls issued because of low fuel last year was two fewer than the 13 made in 2013. One operator, which the CAA did not name, was responsible for 35 of the 111 reports of low fuel in 2014 - which equates to almost a third. Another carrier was responsible for 12 incidents, while another was accountable for 10. A total of 36 operators were deemed responsible for the entire 111 incidents. London's Heathrow Airport experienced the highest number of reports of low fuel incidents in 2014, the figures show. A total of 19 commercial planes, of mixed nationality, were found to be flying low on fuel as they approached the west London airport. In comparison, there were 13 planes recorded at London Gatwick, four planes at London Stansted, and three at both Manchester and Edinburgh. Planes in UK airspace are required to have enough fuel to complete their journey,  have enough to reach another airport in case of a diversion, circle an airport for 30 minutes if necessary and still have a final emergency reserve, which is equivalent to five per cent of the plane's original upload of fuel. All UK operators have a legal obligation to report safety issues and a low fuel declaration falls within that scope, meaning all carriers are forced to declare when an aircraft's fuel has not met the requirement. Some airlines have allegedly been cutting the amount of fuel they carry to make the aircraft lighter and save money. Others suffer fuel shortages during extreme weather when flight patterns are disrupted or aircraft are unable to land because of adverse conditions. A spokesman for the UK Civil Aviation Authority told MailOnline: 'European airlines have a legal responsibility to carry a set minimum level of fuel, enough for the aircraft to carry out its planned journey and cope with any potential issues during the flight. 'However, in very rare circumstances, for example extreme weather, an aircraft may burn fuel faster than calculated. In most cases the aircraft simply lands with less fuel than expected. 'Occasionally, however, the flight crew decide to request a priority landing as they approach an airport in order to maintain its final contingency reserve fuel. 'Airlines and air traffic controllers have well practiced standard operating procedures in place to deal with these situations.' One operator, which the CAA did not name, was responsible for 35 of the 111 reports of low fuel. London's Heathrow Airport (pictured) experienced the highest number of reports of low fuel incidents, with a total of 19 . Pilots' union Balpa described the rising number of low fuel incidents as a 'matter of concern' and said pressure to remain competitive and keep fuel costs down must never compromise passenger safety. A spokesman said: 'Aircraft flying on low fuel not only put that aircraft potentially at risk, but also impact on the wider operation. 'Handling an aircraft on low-fuel means that other aircraft may have to hold longer to give appropriate priority to the emergency aircraft resulting in a possible ""avalanche effect"". 'It is natural, in such a competitive industry, for airlines to look to carry as little fuel as they can in order to save weight and save money. But that commercial pressure must never be at the expense of ensuring a safe flight. 'The CAA’s approach to safety – that of “Safety Management Systems” – is to allow airlines to make their own judgement calls on safety matters and to monitor the result. 'Therefore we hope that the regulator has picked up the fact that one company has been responsible for 30 per cent of the low fuel incidents recorded and has reacted appropriately.' The CAA confirmed that passengers were not in danger in any of the 111 recorded fuel incidents and said there was 'no safety risk to passengers'. In 2012, budget airline Ryanair was recommended to 'review' the amount of fuel it carries after three of its planes – including one from the UK - were forced to make 'Mayday' emergency landings in Spain when they started to run out of fuel. The airline was operating with a level of fuel that was 'close to the minimum' required in the case of a diversion, watchdogs said. Three Ryanair Boeing 737-800 aircraft heading to Madrid were forced to make emergency landings after being diverted to Valencia because of thunderstorms over the Spanish capital. At the time, the Irish Aviation Authority Report recommended Ryanair 'reviews its fuel policy and considers issuing guidance to crew with respect to fuel when operating into busy airports with mixed aircraft operators and types, particularly in poor weather conditions when diversions are likely.' A Ryanair spokesman said: 'The official IAA report into the three Valencia weather diversions in July 2012 confirmed that all three aircraft took extra fuel (because of adverse weather), all three aircraft flew for one hour more than scheduled (due to the diversions) and all three aircraft fully complied with EU safety regulations.' And in October last year, a Thomas Cook flight from Fuerteventura to Newcastle landed with critically low fuel levels. The plane landed with just 900kg of fuel left after a problem with the aircraft’s wing flaps saw meant it had to be diverted from Newcastle to land at Manchester. The jet should have had 1,627kg of 'final reserve,' as indicated in the Air Accident Investigation Branch's report. The diversion lowered the fuel to dangerous levels, when the pilot could have landed the Boeing 757 at Edinburgh, which was closer, or back to Newcastle once the problem was corrected. A spokesperson for Thomas Cook Airlines told Mail Online: 'As a result of the AAIB’s and our own internal investigation, we have completely reviewed pilot training for go-around manoeuvres to ensure operating procedures are accurately followed and when necessary low fuel levels are appropriately declared to air traffic control. The aircraft landed safely at Manchester Airport.’","111 commercial planes caught flying with low fuel levels in the UK last year .

"The next six months could prove the best time in history to take out a mortgage, experts claimed yesterday. They said a price war between lenders will make it the perfect opportunity for homebuyers or anyone remortgaging. Fixed-rate deals have never been cheaper and may even slip below 1 per cent within weeks. Variable rates have almost halved over the past 12 months to 1.64 per cent. Brian Murphy, of the Mortgage Advice Bureau, said: ‘The next six months are shaping up to be the best-ever window to secure a low interest rate if you are looking to buy or remortgage. House buyers can secure fixed rate mortgages of just 1.19 per cent according to new research, file photo . ‘Today’s prices have never been bettered in modern times and given that a base rate rise is inevitable at some point, it is unlikely they will be surpassed in the years ahead. ‘Lenders have begun the year with a strong appetite for growth, and newcomers are going head to head with established names to launch attractive new deals.’ Bank of England data shows that a typical two-year fix has dropped from 2.37 per cent to 2.01 per cent over the past 12 months. On a £200,000 loan with 25 per cent deposit, that would save £420 a year. A five-year fix has fallen from 3.34 per cent to 3.09 per cent, saving £300 a year. And the average variable rate has plunged from 2.74 per cent to 1.64 per cent – chopping £1,300 off annual repayments. Lenders have dropped their rates after economists tipped the Bank to keep its base rate at an historic low of 0.5 per cent until next year. The arrival of new challenger banks entering the mortgage market has also increased competition, driving down rates further. Experts said two-year fixed rates could fall below 1 per cent while five-year mortgages could go below 2 per cent. Shrewd investors can secure a ten-year fixed rate mortgage for just 2.89 per cent according to new figures . Mortgage broker Andrew Montlake, of Coreco, said: ‘We are now seeing rates fall to a level that once seemed unthinkable. ‘Mortgage lenders are in the midst of a rate war which shows no sign of abating soon, as they battle it out for business. ‘With new lenders coming into the market and competition intensifying we could even see these offerings fall a touch lower. ‘The next few months could well prove to be the best time to lock into low rates which may not be seen again for a generation.’ He warned however that the low rates on offer sometimes came with high one-off fees. Experts have said that two-year fixed deals could drop below 1 per cent as established lenders compete with newcomers to win business . And, while mortgages are cheap, steep property prices mean home ownership is still out of reach for many. Prices across the UK rose by 10 per cent in the last year and 15 per cent in London, with the average home now £271,000 or £501,000 in the capital, according to the Office for National Statistics. Campbell Robb of the charity Shelter said: ‘Despite talk of mortgages being at an historic low, it certainly doesn’t feel like that for many young people and families for whom buying their own home remains a distant dream. ‘Sky high house prices mean families working hard and saving what they can can’t even come close to affording a home of their own. The only way to tackle our housing crisis is for politicians to build the affordable houses we urgently need.’ Mortgage rates are also at record lows for homeowners with lower deposits such as 5 and 10 per cent. But while many banks have slashed interest rates potential buyers must still pass strict affordability tests which were introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority last April. The Mortgage Market Review forces lenders to ask applicants in-depth questions about their income and spending habits to ensure they can still afford their repayments if interest rates rise significantly. Last June, the Bank of England also recommended that no more than 15 per cent of new lending was for high-risk loans worth more than 4.5 times buyers’ income. Both of these restrictions initially slowed down the mortgage market as lenders were reluctant to lend for fear of breaking the rules. However, lending has since bounced back after banks and building societies adapted to the changes. Lenders are now making up for lost time and competing aggressively for customers, including those with low deposits, providing they can comfortably afford such a large debt. Happy days: Rumours that the Bank of England could hold base interest rates  at their current record low of 0.5 per cent for another year has sparked a lending war (pictured, bank Governor Mark Carney) The low-deposit market has been fuelled by the Government’s Help to Buy scheme, where the state helps buyers with small deposits on to the property ladder. One of the reasons banks are able to offer mortgages at such low rates at the moment is because they have a glut of cash to loan out from the Funding for Lending scheme. Launched in 2012, the initiative allowed banks and building societies to borrow cheaply from the Bank on condition they then used some of the money to offer mortgages to home buyers. Rigorous stress testing must still be carried out on customers, however, before loans are agreed. Where are the cheapest fixed rate mortgages? The best rate on an online easy access savings account is currently  1.5 per cent from Kent Reliance in branch.  You could also put money away tax-free in a cash Isa and NS&I has the best easy access Isa at 1.5 per cent. There are 25 mortgages priced below these savings rates - not all are fixed rates, some are tracker or variable rates and the cost of these would move up if interest rate rise. HSBC has a record low two-year fixed rate at 1.19 per cent with a £1,499 fee, but you will also need a big 40 per cent deposit. A 25-year £150,000 mortgage would cost £578 a month and £15,378 over two years, including the fee. But you must watch out for the fees attached to the best mortgages as these have risen, so it is still important to shop around. For example, the high fee actually makes this mortgage more expensive. In comparison,Yorkshire Building Society has a higher rate at 1.29 per cent with a £975 fee. That 25-year £150,000 mortgage with Yorkshire Building Society would cost slightly more at £585 a month, but thanks to its lower fee come in £358 cheaper than HSBC at £15,020 over two years. You could also get a rate of 1.24 per cent from Chelsea Building Society with a £1,675 fee. The Post Office has a two-year fixed rate at 1.37 per cent with a £1,995 fee, while Norwich & Peterborough Building Society has a deal at 1.39 per cent with a £795 fee.","A two-year fixed rate mortgage is now available with 1.19 per cent interest .

"The Sydney property market is about to get a hit of La Vida Loca as Ricky Martin's ex-rental property goes up for auction with hopes of fetching more than $11 million. 138 Hewlett Street in Bronte was rented by The Voice judge for three weeks in 2014 as a home for his twin sons, Matteo and Valentino. 'The Wave House', designed by renowned Australian architect Walter Barda, last sold in 2003 for $2.8 million, is built over several levels which all open to spectacular views of Sydney's iconic Bronte Beach. 138 Hewlett Street in Bronte is going under the hammer in March with an anticipated sale price of $11 million . The property reflects its million-dollar price tag, and comes complete with an in-built lap pool which runs from inside to outside, a private gym, and multiple terraces which flow onto the expansive living area. The Hewlett Street mansion was built by the founder of private investment company Blackfish, Simon Harvey, who also purchased the adjoining rear property in 2007, reported Domain. The property has floor-to-ceiling glass windows overlooking a private courtyard, a second outdoor pool, and open plan kitchen and living area. The mansion is constructed from stained timber and stone, and is divided into two areas to accommodate family and visiting guests. The bottom floor includes a 'lanai', a Hawaiian covered room, to allow visitors to have some space while staying in the house. Singer Ricky Martin rented the property to live in with his twin sons in 2014 while filming The Voice . 'The Wave House' was designed by renowned Australian architect Walter Barda . The property boasts two pools, including a lap pool which extends from inside the house to the outside . 'The timber blinds can be pulled down if they choose to have a rest. But they can also use the space as a retreat during the day for reading,' architect Walter Barda told Stephen Crafti in his book Beach Houses Down Under. Scheduled for auction in May, it is not yet known whether the property will be rented out again to A-listers such as Martin, or kept for private use. Martin is set to call Sydney home for the duration of filming the fourth season of The Voice, along with co-judges Joel and Benji Madden, Delta Goodrem, and Jessie J. Despite living in some of the world's most glamorous cities - Paris, New York, Buenos Aires - the 42-year-old has an affinity with Australia which he says reminds him of his native Puerto Rico. 'My kids were born on the road. We spend most of our time in New York. We are from Puerto Rico but (the boys) don't ask when are we going back to New York...they just want to go back to Australia,' he told the Sunday Telegraph. The mansion is constructed from stained timber and stone, and is divided into two areas . The property has floor-to-ceiling glass windows overlooking a private courtyard . The mansion has a second outdoor pool, a private gym, and an open plan kitchen and living area . The Livin' La Vida Loca singer said his worldly five-year-olds have even adapted to the Aussie lingo and beach culture. 'They have the Aussie slang down but the thing is when I come here, I live at the beach and I feel like I have the same life we have back home. Those walks on the beach, those sunsets, the bike rides. I'm an islander and I don't want to change that.' Martin rented another eastern suburbs home in Bondi Beach in 2013 when he lived in Sydney with his then-partner and the father of his twins, Carlos Gonsalez Abella. The Puerto-Rican rented the property from business magnate James Packer, who moved back into the house following his split from Erica Packer.

The property reflects its million-dollar price tag, and comes complete with multiple terraces . The property boasts panoramic views of Sydney's iconic Bronte Beach . The 42-year-old may now need to look for a new pad to rent when he arrives back in Sydney in April for his One World Tour. The Hewlett Street property, which delivers panoramic ocean views from its cliff-top sandstone ramparts, is hoped to fetch upwards of $11 million, which would be a record for the area. Test cricketer Shane Watson and his wife Lee sold their Hewlett Street property for $9 million in October 2014, breaking price records and setting a new standard, reported Domain. The property was 449 square metres, half the size of the 908 square metres 138 Hewlett Street offers prospective buyers.","The Bronte property rented by singer Ricky Martin is up for auction .

"More men are getting Botox than ever before, but unlike their female counterparts, the goal is not to eliminate all of their wrinkles. New York City-based plastic surgeon Dr Norman Rowe said male professionals are asking for subtle changes in their appearance. He's dubbed the look the 'Wall Street Wrinkle' because a large amount of the men requesting the tweaks are in finance. 'They really want to avoid looking overdone,' he told ABC News, explaining that many men view their wrinkles as a 'badge of honor'. Scroll down for video . Best shot: New York-based plastic surgeon Dr Norman Rowe can be seen giving his patient Joseph Mancuso Botox injections to subtly reduce the appearance of his crow's feet, while keeping the rest of his wrinkles . He noted: 'I don't necessarily see that as much in females. They want complete rejuvenation.' According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, nearly 400,000 US males got Botox injections in 2013, which is a 310 percent increase since 2003. Dr Rowe's patient Joseph Mancuso was filmed getting his first Botox injections to reduce the appearance of his crow's feet. 'I don't want it took like as if I have a very stiff face,' he told the outlet. 'I just want to look natural.' Tiny tweaks: This photo shows Mr Mancuso before Dr Rowe administered his Botox injections . New and improved: Mr Mancuso, who said he wanted to look natural, is thrilled by the results seen in this after photo . Since men aren't looking to get rid of all of their wrinkles, Dr Rowe said the procedure is relatively painless because of the reduction in injections. 'Sure you can grow old gracefully,' he said. 'But what's gracefully? A few grey hairs and wrinkles are good. The men, they just want to look refreshed.' Men are also getting Botox injections in their palms and under their arms so they can avoid sweaty handshakes and perspiring through their shirts. Botox injections can cost patients $300 or more and the effects last four to six months after treatment.","According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, nearly 400,000 US males got Botox injections in 2013 .

"The girlfriend of a trainee firefighter who died after becoming trapped under ice in Canada has expressed disbelief at his death and says she will love him 'now and forever.' Tragic Adam Brunt, suffered fatal injuries over the weekend while undergoing ice and water rescue training in southwestern Ontario. The 30-year-old, who was enrolled in the firefighting program at Durham College, was dragged underwater for 15-minutes after getting caught in a strong current in the Saugeen River. Tributes: Girlfriend, Jenna McNamee posted a photo and comments to twitter on Monday. Aspiring firefighter Adam Brunt, 30, died after becoming trapped under ice during rescue training in Ontario . His girlfriend, Jenna McNamee posted a photo and comments on twitter on Monday. In a series of tweets, she wrote: 'It was supposed to be just a simple ice rescue training. My heart is shattered.' 'My sweet boyfriend and soul mate. You are already so dearly missed. I love you now and forever.' 'We never in a million years expected this to happen. We are in shock. And the love of my life is gone.' Paramedics rushed him to hospital, where emergency workers treated him for 'several hours' before he was pronounced dead, according to police. Authorities said the training program for ice and water rescue was provided by a private firm from Newmarket. A statement from Durham College said: 'We are deeply saddened by this incident and will support our students, staff and faculty through this upsetting time.' 'Most students in this program choose to supplement their class instruction with practical experience, acquired from external trainers. 'We understand that Adam was participating in a training exercise that was being conducted by a private firm from Newmarket. That firm has no affiliation to Durham College.' An investigation is being conducted by the Hanover Police Service alongside the coroner's office and investigators with the Ministry of Labour.","Adam Brunt, 30, suffered fatal injury during rescue training in Ontario .

"If you usually doze off with  your back to your partner and a gaping space between you, you'll be pleased to hear you're not alone. A new study into the most common sleep positions for couples revealed the 'liberty' position, sleeping back-to-back without touching, was most popular with 27 per cent of couples pinpointing it as their regular nighttime stance. It may not ring of romance but relationship psychologist Corrine Sweet, who carried out the study on behalf of bed specialist Dreams, believes there's hidden clues to a strong relationship in the non-tactile pose. The way we sleep speaks volumes about the state of our relationship, say psychologists (picture posed by models) Psychologist Corrine Sweet believes sleep position can speak volumes about the state of a relationship . 'It shows the couple is connected and secure,' says Ms Sweet, who says sleep positions can speak volumes about the state of a relationship. So what does your sleep stance say about your relationship? Liberty: Back-to-back without touching . Some 27 per cent sleep in this position with plenty of space keeping them apart. Ms Sweet said that couples who adopt the Liberty are: 'Connected and secure in themselves, this position shows both closeness and independence in the relationship.' Cherish: Back-to-back touching . 'A quarter of pairs (23 per cent) like to sleep separately, facing different directions - and is often a sign of a new romance. Ms Sweet said that it means that, 'both partners are relaxed and comfortable with one another – this is often common in new relationships.' 'Spooning' and the 'lover's knot' were found to be the third and fourth most popular positions . Spooning: Front-to-back touching . The classic loving sleep position although one of the most famous, is only adopted by a fifth (18 per cent) of couples. Ms Sweet said it's a 'traditional position' and demonstrates a dynamic, 'where one partner takes a protective stance over the other.' Lovers’ knot: Face-to-face, . The most complex position in which a couple lies facing each other, with their legs and arms intertwined for ten minutes before they separate, is a sign of relationship strength. Yet only eight per cent adopt this complex position. Ms Sweet said it's, 'a compromise between intimacy and independence, allowing for the best of both worlds.' He may feel like  superhero but do you? Sleep positions can be an insight into a relationship . Superhero: Starfish position . Women may hold out for a hero but when it comes to going to bed it's the last thing you need. Some three per cent of selfish sleepers adopt the starfish position, pushing the other partner so they're hanging off the bed. Ms Sweet's verdict is that: 'One partner dominates the space, while the other takes a secondary role.' The romantic: Resting head on chest . This intimate posture, in which one partner rests their head on their partner's chest, while their legs are intertwined is often seen in early relationships. Adopted by four per cent of couples Ms Sweet explained it 'represents vibrant, passionate or rekindled love.' Couples who sleep face-to-face, as in these positions above, are in the minority . Pillow talk: Face-to-face without touching . With space between them but their bodies mirroring each other, only three per cent of couples lie in the pillow talk position. But Ms Sweet noted that it could indicate an emotionally demanding union. 'This position shows a need for intimacy and close communication.' The Lovers: Face-to-face with legs intertwined all night . There's a reason only two per cent of pairs lsleep lying so closely intertwined. Ms Sweet said that although it's 'romantic and very intimate, this position also shows a lack of independence from each other.' Despite sleep studies showing that 94 per cent of couples who spend the night in contact with each other are happy with their relationship, Ms Sweet believes autonomy in the bedroom is no bad thing. And considering 25 per cent of couples argue in bed because they are kept awake by their partners, it's no surprise one in five British couples choose to sleep in separate beds. Which of these rings true in your relationship? Physiotherapist Sammy Margo, author of The Good Sleep Guide, also believes couples should not resist sleeping apart if it means a better night's sleep. She said: 'More often than not sleeping separately has nothing to do with a couple's relationship and everything to do with their urgent need for a better night's sleep. 'Often it starts when one partner has an episode of illness, such as a cough, heavy cold or back pain, and moves temporarily to another room so as not to disturb their partner (or in some cases to the sofa) and they both enjoy such a good night’s sleep that they decide to keep it that way. She also point out that men and women sleep differently: 'Men spend more time in stage one sleep and women spend more time in slow wave sleep. 'Hormonal fluctuations due to the menstrual cycle can also disrupt sleep for many women, not to mention the fact that women with curves have different mattress needs to men without curves. 'In short, men and women have different sleep needs. 'Statistics show that people who sleep poorly have a higher divorce rate - so if you persist in sharing a bed despite having your sleep disrupted, you risk not just poor performance at work, reduced concentration and poor health but problems in your relationship.' Physiotherapist and sleep expert Sammy Margo explains how to share a bed without losing sleep: . Problem: Snoring . What to do: One thing you might want to do if your partner snores is to record him or her snoring. A regular tape recorder or video camera will do. Often the first steps in coping with snoring is getting the snorer to believe there is a problem. With the evidence in your hands, you can move on to fixing the problem. Another strategy is to go to bed first. If you are in deeper stages of sleep when your partner comes to bed, his or her snoring is less likely to interrupt your sleep. Problem: Restless sleepers . What to do: Your partner could have restless leg syndrome or a related condition called periodic limb movement during sleep so a check up at the GP is advised to rule this out. If allergies are the problem antihistamines can be the answer or simply cleaning your bedroom and airing your bed more during the day. Check out too that you aren’t using washing powders that are causing irritations. Buying a bigger bed makes sense. Many standard double beds are simply too small so buy the biggest bed you can. If this isn’t possible try a mattress that zips down the middle or try putting two single mattresses on one bed; this way you are far less likely to be woken with a kick. Problem: Differences in body heat . What to do: The obvious answer is to buy and use separate single duvets. You can then both choose the duvet weight and comfort level that you want. Don’t forget to that a cool room is optimal for good sleep. Wearing lightweight natural fibres such as cotton in bed will also help regulate body heat. Problem: You're a lark, they're an owl . What to do: Replace any bedside lamps with reading lights as they are less disruptive.You should also both invest in an eye mask to block out all light. If you’re a lark and your partner is an owl it’s probably best if only your partner wears the ear plugs. This is because one of you needs to be able to hear an alarm and it’s easier for a lark to sleep through when an owl goes to bed than it is for an owl to sleep through when a lark gets up. We sleep more lightly in the second half of the night, so if one of you gets up early, the other is likely to wake more easily. Larks who sleep with owls should also try to put their clothes out ready in another room so that they don’t rustle around in the morning when they are getting dressed. Owls should return the favour at night by getting ready for bed in another room. Pay attention also to the layout of your bedroom so that an owl does not have to pass the lark’s side of the bed at night.","A new study reveals most common sleep positions for British couples .

"A teacher who seduced a boy at her school has been spared prison so she can look after her seriously ill husband and their son. Jacqueline Marks, 33, had sex with the 16-year-old pupil in her marital home and in her car. The head of maths at a school in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, finally ended the relationship after nearly two months. Jacqueline Marks, 33 (pictured outside court today), had full sex four times with the 16-year-old boy during a two-month relationship which also included incidents of touching, kissing and oral sex. She was spared jail . But she was caught out when an ex-girlfriend of the teenager found explicit messages on his iPad. Judge Jonathan Howarth yesterday told Marks she ‘richly deserved to go to prison’ for the ‘serious breach of trust’. But he gave her a nine-month sentence, suspended for two years, after hearing her husband had a heart condition. ‘You bear full responsibility for the breach of the law in this case … there is nothing in your personal mitigation that had led me to suspend the sentence,’ the judge said. ‘But you have a seven-year-old son and you are responsible for his care. ‘You have a husband who in the latter months of last year suffered a serious illness. ‘He is due to have a series of operations – the first of which is on February 27. Your role as a mother and wife is clearly crucial to them.’ Marks had taught the boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, for several years at the secondary school. She took him for seven lessons every week and had begun giving him extra maths tutoring which was organised by the school. Marks (pictured outside court, right) admitted having four sex sessions with the teenager - three times in her car and once at her home in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. She admitted six counts of abusing a position of trust . Edward Renvoize, prosecuting, said by January last year Marks felt ‘flattered’ by the attention the pupil was showing her and a sexual relationship began in May. ‘It escalated to cuddles and kisses and to her performing oral sex on him and then having full sex, once at her home and three times in her car,’ he added. Marks brought the affair to an end as the boy approached his GCSE exams and thought her secret was safe. But on June 23 the boy’s former girlfriend found messages on his iPad. She guessed who was involved, even though Marks was not named in them. Details of the incriminating messages were not given at Cambridge Crown Court. But Mr Renvoize added: ‘[The boy’s ex-girlfriend] was able to work out who the text messages had come from and she showed them to her mother. Marks was also banned from working with males under 18 for the next five years at Cambridge Crown Court (pictured). She was also subjected to supervision requirements and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register . 'When the boy was confronted, he said, “I’ve done it, although it’s not as bad as it looks”.’ Both the school and police were contacted. Marks, of Stevenage, was arrested and at first refused to answer questions but made a full confession in a second interview. Checks on a personal computer revealed she had been visiting sites concerning relationships between teachers and pupils. Marks wept as Paul Kaufman, defending, said: ‘As a consequence of what has taken place, the defendant has lost her career, which she valued hugely and enjoyed. ‘She has lost her status in the community and her complete circle of friends.’ He added that her husband was facing five operations for his heart condition over the next year. As a result of his illness, she was helping him run his small business. ‘The husband has had to deal with the most devastating news,’ Mr Kaufman said. ‘He has accepted it and is prepared to make a go of the marriage.’ Marks admitted six counts of abusing a position of trust. She was banned from working unsupervised with males under the age of 18, and her name will be on the Sex Offenders Register for the next ten years. The victim’s family declined to comment.","Teacher Jacqueline Marks, 33, had sex four times with her 16-year-old pupil .

"What's in a name? Not much, it seems, as far as Eurovision chiefs are concerned: they have invited Australia to take part in this year's notionally pan-European singing contest. Organisers said they are inviting an act from Down Under to be fast-tracked to the final this May in Vienna, in a special move to mark the 60th anniversary of the competition. Broadcasters hailed the 'historic' move and said it would elevate the show to a 'new global level'. Scroll down for video . Australian Eurovision hosts Sam Pang and Julia Zemiro celebrate the 'historic' move . Eurovision... and beyond: The organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest are to allow Australia to compete in a shock move to mark the 60th anniversary of the notionally pan-European music competition . Jon Ola Sand, executive supervisor of the contest at the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), said: 'It's a daring and at the same time incredibly exciting move. It is our way of saying ""let's celebrate this party together"".' Australia has until March 16 to decide who will represent them at the show, which has previously accepted entries from outside Europe but none from so far away. Australian singer Jess Mauboy was a guest performer at Eurovision in Copenhagen in 2014 . Although the country's entry will pass straight through to the competition's grand final, Australia will still be allowed to vote in both semi-finals as well. The country will convene a panel of judges, but organisers are considering a phone in to allow the Australian public to help decide 50 per cent of the votes dished out to other countries. But there is no chance of the Antipodean entrant will wrest this most-European of institutions to the other side of the world; organisers promise that even if Australia does win it will not host next year's show, as tradition dictates of regular entrants. Australia's participation is being touted as a one-off initiative to mark the show's anniversary. However, if they do clinch the title they will be allowed to defend their crown. It is not the first time a country from outside Europe has taken part in Eurovision. Israel, Cyprus and Armenia, in Western Asia, have competed since 1973, 1981 and 2006 respectively; and Morocco, in North Africa, in the 1980 competition alone . Several transcontinental countries with only part of their territory in Europe have also competed: Turkey, since 1975; Russia, since 1994; Georgia, since 2007; and Azerbaijan, which made its first appearance in the 2008 edition. Lebanon in Western Asia, Tunisia in North Africa and even Qatar, in the heart of the Middle East, have all previously tried to enter Eurovision but ended up not competing after complications. Last year's winner: Conchita Wurst, a bearded drag queen from Austria, clinched the title with her belter Rise Like a Phoenix at the final in Denmark . Michael Ebeid, managing director of broadcaster SBS, which airs the show in Australia, said: 'We are very excited to have secured this historic opportunity for Australia to be represented on the world's biggest stage at the 60th anniversary of the Eurovision Song Contest and are honoured that the European Broadcasting Union has supported us to achieve this ambition. 'SBS has been broadcasting Eurovision for over 30 years and we have seen how Australians' love of the song contest has grown during those years.' Alexander Wrabetz, director general of host broadcasters ORF, said: 'The song contest has developed in its history to become the biggest TV entertainment event in the world. 'With the participation of Australia, together with our partners at the EBU and SBS, we have succeeded to lift it to a new global level and to build another bridge for the 60th anniversary - a bridge that spans the globe, starting from the heart of Europe.' Twitter was tonight abuzz with comment on the surprise addition to the Eurovision roster. 'Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest? Anglosphere is just trolling Europe now. Pure humiliation,' wrote Factoria Forex, an account which usually posts investment news in Spanish. Other users questioned Eurovision chiefs' grip of geography. 'Erm...australia are to compete in the 2015 eurovision song contest?? Seriously...what?? did they confuse it with austria??' wrote one tweeting under the pseudonym No. Another using the name Ron Jeremy said: 'So Australia are gonna be in the Eurovision song contest, but they're in ummmm okay, yeah f*** it whatever #logic.' Sam West echoed the notion, saying: 'I can kinda understand how Morocco & Israel have been in the Eurovision Song Contest. But Australia being in it. That is a different story.' Australians using the microblogging platform seemed pleased with the development. David Moutou gushed: 'Our dream has come true! Australia to compete in #Eurovision this year!' But others were more guarded. Mike Ticher posted a pictured of Conchita Wurst, the bearded drag queen from Austria, with the comment: 'Australia enters Eurovision. Hope we don't make embarrassingly kitsch spectacle of ourselves.' Other tweets called for the further extension of Eurovision. Charlie Skelton wrote: 'Australia invited to join #Eurovision? Israel already competes. Time, surely, for Palestine to get the green light.'","Australia to be fast-tracked to this year's final to mark 60th anniversary .

"Jordan Flynn, 19, died suddenly from a rare inflammation of the heart, after visiting the GP and being told he was suffering from a virus . A 19-year-old PE student died suddenly from a suspected heart infection - just days after doctors told him to take paracetamol. First-year university student Jordan Flynn was told by a GP that he had a virus and needed to rest and take painkillers to ease his symptoms. But days later he died with his mother at his side in intensive care - just a week after his 19th birthday. His sudden and unexpected death has shocked his peers at the University of Brighton's campus in Eastbourne, East Sussex, where they held a vigil on Monday night. His heartbroken mother, Angie Flynn, of Birmingham, said: 'He had been ill for a couple of days and he was talking to me on the phone telling me he had low energy, fatigue and was unable to move. 'He also kept passing out so I was worried because his uni friends had all gone home and he was on his own there.' She convinced him to see the GP but she claims they turned her son away believing it was a viral infection. But when he didn't recover, Mrs Flynn told her son to call NHS 111 for advice. The service called for paramedics and Mr Flynn was taken to Eastbourne District General Hospital's coronary unity. She said: 'I sat with him the entire time and he was very, very breathless and very, very restless.' Mr Flynn, originally from Wales, was then taken to be treated by heart specialists at Harefield Hospital, in Hillingdon, north west London, where he died on February 3. He died from previously undiagnosed myocarditis – inflammation of the heart – and suffered a cardiac arrest, the Brighton Argus reports. The rare condition which causes inflammation and is often triggered by a virus, damages the heart muscle or the fibres that conduct electrical pulses to the heart, causing complications. There are no specific causes of the condition but it is usually triggered by a virus. Mrs Flynn said she wishes he had been admitted to hospital earlier and transferred to the specialist unit while he still had some strength. Paying tribute to her son she told Argus journalists: 'I was trying to think how I would describe my handsome smiling son Jordan, but really no words could do justice to his strength, determination, logic, humour and his beautiful soul. 'He was someone I always aspired to be. Mr Flynn was a first year student at the University of Brighton. Students at the university set off sky lanterns to mark Jordan's passing, and will hold a memorial service this week . She added: 'Jordan truly appreciated each day and the simplest things in life made him happy, like pranks, granola, football, his PlayStation and his bed. 'How he lived showed us that success is measured in how you live and not in what you have or do. His ordinary was our extraordinary, his beauty was in not knowing how truly amazing he was.' University of Brighton students set off sky lanterns to mark Mr Flynn's passing, and will hold a memorial service this week. His friend Andy Matthews tweeted: 'RIP Jordan Flynn, sad news and a massive shock. Loved playing football with you and winding you up. You will be missed by a lot of people.' Another friend, Sam Dayaman, tweeted: 'RIP Jordan Flynn , was a pleasure playing football with you and spending time together in our college classes. Sleep tight mate x' His post mortem examination is due to be held this week. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle. There are no specific causes of the condition but it is usually triggered by a virus. Some of the most common infections which cause myocarditis, are those called adenovirus and Coxsackie B. Others include: . Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle, often caused by a virus . Symptoms of the condition, include: . If the inflammation damages the heart muscle or the fibres that conduct electrical pulses to the heart, complications can develop. They can develop quickly, and include sudden loss of consciousness, an abnormally fast, slow or irregular heartbeat, and heart failure. In most cases of viral myocarditis, the illness goes away and there are no complications. In some cases the inflammation and damage is so severe the only treatment option is a heart transplant. In very severe cases the condition is fatal. Also, some cases of sudden death in a previously healthy person are due to an acute myocarditis that develops rapidly.

"A security expert has published 10 million passwords and their corresponding usernames to shed light on how people pick their pins. Mark Burnett claims his move is for research purposes but admitted he is concerned that it may incur the wrath of the FBI. The passwords exposed were stripped of certain details, however, which Burnett says stops criminals gaining access to any accounts. A security expert has published 10 million passwords and their corresponding usernames to shed light on how people pick their pins. Mark Burnett claims his move is for research purposes and is worried that it may incur the wrath of the FBI . Mr Burnett said in a blog post that his decision to publish the data in full on Monday evening - which was gathered from a thousands of global incidents over the last five years, instead of a specific hack - was so experts can better understand how people pick their passwords. For example, the data could be used to work out how often people include their usernames within their passwords, Ars Technica reported. ‘Analysis of usernames with passwords is an area that has been greatly neglected and can provide as much insight as studying passwords alone,’ he wrote. Mr Burnett said that his decision to publish the data in full on Monday evening, was so experts can understand how people pick their passwords. He stripped out necessary data to stop it criminal hackers (illustrated) using the passwords for unscrupulous means . Avoid favourite sports. ‘Baseball’ and ‘football’ were both in the top 10 worst password list. Birthdays and years of birth are easy to guess with the help of personal information. Common names such as Michael and Jennifer are insecure, with many making SplashData’s Top 50 list, too. Experts suggest using eight mixed types of characters, with seemingly random combinations if possible. They say that passphrases – short words with spaces or other characters separating them – are easy to recall and are relatively secure if seemingly random words are used. Experts also advise having different passwords for different sites, instead of relying on one, which if hacked, could prove particularly serious. He said he is concerned that the publication of the data may get him in legal trouble, however. ‘Recent events have made me question the prudence of releasing this information, even for research purposes,’ he said, citing the example of the prosecution of Anonymous activist Barrett Brown. 'The FBI took advantage of him linking to a data dump to initiate charges of identity theft and trafficking of authentication features,' according to Burnett. ‘I think this is completely absurd that I have to write an entire article justifying the release of this data out of fear of prosecution or legal harassment. ‘I had wanted to write an article about the data itself but I will have to do that later because I had to write this lame thing trying to convince the FBI not to raid me.’ In his defence, the researcher said: ‘In the case of me releasing usernames and passwords, the intent here is certainly not to defraud, facilitate unauthorised access to a computer system, steal the identity of others, to aid any crime or to harm any individual or entity. ‘The sole intent is to further research with the goal of making authentication more secure and therefore protect from fraud and unauthorised access.’ To ensure that the logins could not be used for illegal purposes, he removed the domain portion from email addresses, mixed up data from different leaks so it could not be traced to any particular company and removed keywords such as company names or any data that could be linked to an individual. He also removed information that could be a credit card number and any accounts suspected as belonging to government or military members. ‘Furthermore, I believe these are primarily dead passwords…and this data is largely useless for illegal purposes, Mr Burnett wrote. Mr Burnett said: ‘The sole intent is to further research with the goal of making authentication more secure and therefore protect from fraud and unauthorised access.’ A report by SplashData released in January revealed that ‘123456’ was the most popular credential last year, followed by ‘password' (illustrated) This means that passwords have already been changed and that all the data is already available online. ‘…I have taken extraordinary measures to make this data ineffective in targeting particular users or organisations.’ In January, a report by SplashData revealed that ‘123456’ was the most popular credential last year, followed by ‘password.’ The most used passwords of last year were also the most insecure, causing security experts to urge users to pick less obvious login details to keep their information safe. The remaining top five most popular passwords were ‘12345’, ‘12345678’ and ‘qwerty’ according to the firm, which develops password management software. The company, which is based in Los Gatos, California, analysed files containing millions of stolen passwords posted online during the previous year. 1. 123456 . 2. password . 3. 12345 . 4. 12345678 . 5. qwerty . 6. 1234567890 . 7. 1234 . 8. baseball . 9. dragon . 10. football . 11. 1234567 . 12. monkey . 13. letmein . 14. abc123 . 15. 111111 . 16. mustang . 17. access . 18. shadow . 19. master . 20. michael . 21. superman . 22. 696969 . 23. 123123 . 24. batman . 25. trustno1 . As well as lazy number and letter combinations that can be entered with a swipe of the thumb, it also noticed ‘easily guessable’ passwords such as 'letmein,' ‘football’ and ‘batman’ were included in its top 25 worst pins. New additions to the top 25 include: 'baseball', 'dragon', 'football', 'mustang', 'access', 'master', 'michael', 'superman', '696969' and 'batman'. Also in the top 100 are swear words and phrases, hobbies, famous athletes, car brands, and film names.

"A primary school where more than 90 per cent of pupils have English as their second or even third language is one of the highest-achieving in the country . Less than seven per cent of the 240 students at St Peter's Catholic Academy, in Cobridge, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, hold English as their mother tongue, with many pupils joining the school without knowing a word of English. Altogether, 93.3 per cent of the children speak English as a second or even third language - with their first language including Punjabi, Urdu, Bengali, Polish, Kurdish, Filipino, Czech, Arabic, Turkish, Slovak, Bulgarian, German, Malayalam, Portuguese or Slovak. Less than seven per cent of the 240 students at St Peter's Catholic Academy, in Cobridge, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, speak English as their first language. Pictured (from left): Abby Sim, 10, Izzy Albano, 10, Harris Sherafghan, 10, Nazeerah Khan, 11, David Adebiyi, 10, Suhayla Bintahmed, 10 and Felicity Delos-Santos, 10 . Other languages at the school include Tagalog, an Austronesian language; Yoruba, a west African dialect from Benin; Shona, from Zimbabwe; Chichewa, a Malawi language; Pangasinan, from the Philippines; Pashto, from Afghanistan and Bemba, spoken in northern Zambia. Half of the youngsters are from Pakistani heritage backgrounds - while others come from Bangladeshi, Indian, African and Roma cultures. However, despite being one of the most multi-cultural schools in Britain, it is also one of the highest-achieving - with its school-leavers achieving above the national average in reading, writing and maths. The state academy, which caters for girls and boys aged three to 11, received an 'outstanding' rating in its 2011 Ofsted report. St Peter's claims its success is down to its approach in supporting youngsters who speak English as an additional language, suggesting it could provide valuable lessons for other UK schools. The school has extra staff, particularly in the nursery and infants, and they 'immerse' the children in the English language from day one, with vibrant displays in classrooms and corridors. The children work in small groups for activities and every class takes part in a 'literacy circle' once a week. Dianne Mason, executive headteacher of St Peter's, said coping with such a large number of pupils from different backgrounds is due to investment in quality staff. She said: 'I've got outstanding teachers. I can't have anything less than outstanding. 'Pupils have a visual timetable and there are pictures on the drawers. It's so they can start to remember the words by looking at the pictures. 'They will have five or six members of staff in the literacy circle, who read with the children. They read a quality book, take it home, and then bring it back to discuss it - children love it. Despite being one of the most multi-cultural schools in Britain, St Peter's (pictured) is also one of the highest-achieving - with its school-leavers achieving above the national average in reading, writing and maths subjects . 'That enthusiasm is infectious. Pupils are also keen to help their classmates learn English. 'We're concerned that they become fluent in their own language first - then they can learn English. 'When you ask a child a question, unless they have really good English, they tend to translate it into their own language, formulate an answer, and then translate that answer into English. 'They need more time to answer a question. People say it can take seven years for a child to fully understand another language, with all the inferences. 'But with support, they do catch up. We try lots of strategies. There's no let-up.' Some families of pupils at the school have relocated to Stoke-on-Trent through their jobs or to be near relatives. Suhayla Bint-Ahmed, 10, from Cobridge, Stoke-on-Trent, who has been learning about cultures, said: 'My first language is Bengali and my friend speaks Tagalog. 'She's taught me how to count in her language and I've taught her how to count in mine. I think it's cool that we're such a multicultural school.' Another pupil Uswa Mirza, 11, started at St Peter's in October last year and only began learning English weeks earlier. She said: 'I speak Urdu and German and was living in Germany before. 'When I started at this school, it wasn't easy. But they gave me a dictionary so I could understand what words meant. 'My mum and cousins can also speak English and have helped me.' St Peter's claims its success is down to its approach in supporting youngsters who speak English as an additional language and said extra teachers are used to help 'immerse' pupils in the language from day one . However, other children who grew up in the area still arrive at school knowing little English because their parents speak other languages at home. Victoria Foksa, 10, can still remember what it was like to join the school knowing no English. She said: 'It was scary at first. But the teachers helped me and so did my friends. I feel I've learnt so much. My first language is Polish and my first word in English was ""hello"".' Fellow pupil Uswa Mirza, 11, is one of the most recent recruits having started at St Peter's in October and only began learning English weeks earlier. She said: 'I speak Urdu and German and was living in Germany before. When I started at this school, it wasn't easy. 'But they gave me a dictionary so I could understand what words meant. My mum and cousins can also speak English and have helped me.' A new national report has found wide variations in the achievements of English Additional Language (EAL) pupils. It says support in the classroom can be a postcode lottery because of uneven funding distribution and has called for resources to be more effectively targeted at those most in need. The report also suggests youngsters who come to the UK from Portuguese, Somali and Lithuanian backgrounds have especially low outcomes at school, while Russian and Spanish speakers do far better. In 2012, it emerged the 414 pupils at English Martyrs' Catholic School in Birmingham spoke 31 languages between them. A documentary about Gascoigne Primary School in Barking, East London, where youngsters speak over 60 languages is set be aired on Channel 5 on Thursday.","Most pupils don't have English as first language at Stoke-on-Trent school .

He told the magazine: 'I am glad it is on BBC2. When we first started submitting the rushes there was a discussion, at a fairly high level within the BBC, about whether the show should move to BBC1. 'I argued with the producers that this would be a mistake. It wouldn't meet the slot average and therefore the BBC would be put on the defensive.

"A hairdresser was allegedly talking on the phone to her own grandfather when she knocked down and killed a retired couple walking arm in arm during their evening stroll, a court has heard. Taylor McDonnell, 21, was said to have screamed 'Bampi' down the phone - the name for her grandfather - as she ploughed into Denis and Joyce Drew, both 86, in November last year. The court heard the call to her grandparents was at least the fourth she had made during a 20-minute drive through the village of Ponthir, near Caerleon, South Wales to visit her boyfriend. Taylor McDonnell, 21 (pictured) allegedly screamed down the phone to her grandfather as she ploughed into a retired couple as they went for an evening stroll through the village of Ponthir, near Caerleon . Denis and Joyce Drew, both 86, who had been married for 54 years, died after being struck by the vehicle . Retired RAF airman Mr Drew and his former teacher wife, who had Alzheimer's disease, died after being hit by McDonnell's blue Toyota Aygo. The couple - who were both using walking sticks - had been married for 54 years. The 21-year-old, who was wearing slippers at the time, denies being on her phone at the time of the fatal crash and insists she rang her grandparents, Janet and Francis, from a lay-by. Today, a jury heard evidence from Mr and Mrs McDonnell, who said they had both spoken to their granddaughter during that fateful evening. Mr McDonnell said: 'My wife received a phone call from Taylor ... and the phone was passed to me. 'I spoke to her about her father ... and his new job. She sounded elated. 'Then the next sentence I heard her screaming ""Bampi, Bampi"" and then the phone cut off. We tried to ring her back but were unable to get an answer.' Both Mr and Mrs McDonnell said their granddaughter had not told them she was driving when they took the call and neither heard any significant noise in the background. However, Mr McDonell admitted he has problems with his hearing. McDonnell was said to have screamed 'Bampi' down the phone - the name for her grandfather - as she hit the couple, who were both walking along the road with walking sticks . McDonnell (pictured left outside court, and right) was driving in her slippers and was on her way to visit her boyfriend, the court heard. Prosecutor Lucy Crowther said McDonnell made 'four or five' calls while driving . Prosecutor Lucy Crowther told the court: 'McDonnell made a phone call to her grandmother and they had a discussion. 'After the call with her grandmother she spoke with her grandfather. 'He said his granddaughter sounded calm and he couldn't hear any background noise and then suddenly she shouted: ""Bampi! Bampi!"" and the phone cut off.' She added: 'They were understandably distraught because they were worried their granddaughter might have been hurt in some sort of accident. So concerned was her grandfather he set out to try and find her.' Ms Crowther told the court how the pair had nearly finished their crossing a 30mph road outside a well-lit pub when they were hit by McDonnell at 7.30pm. 'She wasn't paying proper attention to her driving - which ultimately caused the deaths of two elderly people - because a telephone call was far more important,' she said. The prosecution said McDonnell (pictured), a hairdresser, admitted speaking on her telephone while driving but said she had been using the loudspeaker function when the crash occurred on November 13, 2013 . McDonnell (pictured), of Caerwent, Monmouthshire, was said to have run hysterically into a nearby pub and started screaming for help while clutching her iPhone in her hand following the crash, the court heard . Following the collision, the court heard that McDonnell  ran into the nearby Star Inn in a hysterical state. Witness Debra Ann Bird, who was in the pub with three friends, said: 'This girl ran in screaming ""Help me"". She looked absolutely devastated and her legs were buckling under her. She was in such a state of shock.' Helena Thomas, a long-time friend of the couple, said Mr Drew was a devoted husband and went everywhere with his wife, who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Mrs Thomas recalled one occasion, two years before the tragedy, when Mrs Drew suddenly walked across a pelican crossing as a lorry approached. She said: 'Did I have sufficient concern to step out into the road and usher her across quickly? Yes. 'But there was enough time for us to cross. I was concerned like I would have been with any elderly person.' Yesterday, family and friends of the elderly couple wept as they listened to the heroic efforts of other motorists to comfort the pair after the crash. The crash happened on a quiet 30mph road in the village of Ponthir, near Caerleon, South Wales (pictured) One driver, who found Mrs Drew lying in the verge, covered her with a jacket, gave her basic first aid and 'talked to her and stroked her hair and held her hand' until paramedics arrived, the court was told. Mr Drew was able to speak to the police officers and ambulance crew as they fought to free him. 'He spent all the time asking about his wife,' said Miss Crowther. Mrs Drew was taken to the Royal Gwent Hospital but died of her 'massive injuries'  just a few hours later. Mr Drew was too weak to undergo surgery to treat the multiple fractures, lacerations and deep bruising he suffered, and he died in the same hospital six days later. Newport Crown Court heard McDonnell admitted speaking on her phone on the night of November 13, 2013, but said she had been using the loudspeaker function at the time of the crash. McDonnell denies two counts of causing dangerous driving at Newport Crown Court (pictured above) Shortly before being arrested McDonnell asked the officer who arrested her, PC Carl Green: 'Why did she walk out in front of me?' and also said a woman hit her windscreen after 'coming from nowhere'. Previously, the court heard that McDonnell had not realised she had hit Mr Drew until being told by someone else. The prosecution alleges that McDonnell was 'grossly distracted' while behind the wheel of her Toyota Aygo on November 13, 2013. They say the defendant had been on the phone for around 18 minutes of her 20-minute journey and spoke to several different people. McDonnell, from Caerwent, Monmouthshire, denies two counts of causing death by dangerous driving. The case continues.
