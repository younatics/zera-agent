"Louisville, Kentucky (CNN) -- Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell uses sports metaphors to describe why he should be re-elected and not sacked by Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, who would be Kentucky's first woman senator. ""Change the U.S. Senate and make me the offensive coordinator instead of the defensive coordinator,"" McConnell said to a small but enthusiastic crowd in Bowling Green. ""Sports fans know you can score on defense, but it's hard. When you're on offense, you get to call the plays and set the agenda for Kentucky and for America. That's what makes a big difference."" Translation: After two straight elections in which GOP fumbles kept Republicans in the minority, McConnell has another chance at running the Senate as majority leader, but that won't happen if he's defeated here at home and knocked out of the game. 2014 midterms: Key races to watch . On the eve of primary day here, McConnell appears confident he has crushed his challenger from the right, Matt Bevin. But it remains to be seen how much of a toll the manpower and money he has spent against Bevin will take -- whether it will weaken him in what is expected to be the toughest campaign against a Democratic challenger in the three decades he has been in office. General election: Who can better define Grimes? It is also unclear whether the Republicans who don't support McConnell in the primary will end up voting for him in the fall. McConnell's campaign points out that Republican primary voters largely rallied around Rand Paul after a divisive GOP battle in 2010 and hope the same will happen this year for McConnell. Grimes, a 35-year-old attorney and Kentucky's secretary of state, has a classic campaign strategy against the 72-year-old, five-term Senate incumbent: it's time for change. ""We've had 30 years of failed leadership under Mitch McConnell; we cannot afford six more,"" Grimes declared emphatically to a packed house at her campaign headquarters here in Louisville. 5 key primaries to watch on Tuesday . To counter that, McConnell is using a classic strategy for a longtime incumbent. He is trying to paint his seniority as a plus and warn Kentuckians about the perils of a junior senator with little clout in Washington representing them instead of a potential Senate majority leader. ""My opponent, I certainly agree, is a new face, but a new face for what? New face for the status quo. Same majority leader, same agenda, no change at all. A new face for no change at all,"" McConnell argues on the stump. But Grimes' full-throated assault on McConnell goes beyond a call for change. She is using McConnell's GOP leader status and his frequent moves to block legislation to make him the symbol of gridlock in Washington. We put that to McConnell in a brief interview. ""What Kentuckians have to decide is which direction they want the country to take,"" McConnell told CNN. ""Do we want to go in a different direction, or do we want Harry Reid to continue to be the majority leader? Do we want a vote for Barack Obama in a state that he carried four out of 120 countries? That's what's really at stake in the fall election,"" McConnell told us. Poll: Democrats competitive in key Southern showdowns . Like Republicans all over the country, McConnell is trying hard to make this election a referendum on Obama, who lost Kentucky big in 2012 and is highly unpopular now. The problem for McConnell is that he too has a high unfavorable rating, and Democrats here are hoping that will be his ultimate downfall. But McConnell has already been working hard to soften his image with positive television ads. He is also almost always accompanied at campaign stops by his wife, former George W. Bush Labor Secretary Elaine Chao. At their appearance in Bowling Green, she introduced McConnell by calling him her ""soul mate."" Republicans hope that helps another challenge he has in his race against Grimes: women. Grimes is unabashed in her quest to get female voters to the polls by reminding them that she would be their first female senator, but also by ripping McConnell on issues relating to women, such as his opposition to equal pay legislation like the Lilly Ledbetter Act. ""I hope you will spread the word not just across Jefferson County but the Commonwealth of Kentucky that this woman, well, she's not an empty dress, she's not a cheerleader, she's not a rubber stamp, she's an independent Kentucky woman that stands on her own two feet,"" Grimes yelled to her crowd here. Grimes edges out McConnell in cash battle . When asked about what polls show is a wide gender gap between him and Grimes, McConnell turned to Obamacare. ""Women in Kentucky have been treated just as badly in this environment as men have. Obamacare, you know women are typically those who manage their family's health care. They've been adversely impacted by Obamacare in a serious way. Surveys indicate women object to Obamacare even more than men. I think it ought to be pulled out from the root of the grass, and we ought to start over. I know that's not the view of my opponent in the fall,"" McConnnell told CNN. As for Grimes, she may be trying to make Washington's problems all about McConnell, but she also clearly knows she has to overcome deep opposition to the President by separating herself from him. ""This election is not a referendum on the President. Nothing about this election is going to change who our President is, but we can actually change who is in Washington, D.C., and put someone there who fights for the people of this state instead of looking out for his own job,"" Grimes told CNN. She has been trying to aggressively criticize the President's policies on coal, seen in this coal-producing state as punitive. Like other Democrats on the ballot this year, she sidestepped our questions about whether she would welcome the President's help. She did, however, tell us she would love to campaign with Hillary Clinton, whom she called her ""role model."" Grimes' father was a prominent supporter of President Bill Clinton during his campaigns and presidency. The former President, whom she called ""family,"" has already been to Kentucky to raise money for Grimes.","Mitch McConnell seems set to cruise to a primary win, but the cost remains to be seen .

"Washington (CNN) -- Actress Daryl Hannah was arrested Tuesday during a sit-in in front of the White House protesting a pipeline expansion project that would significantly increase the amount of oil the United States imports from Canada's controversial Alberta oil sands. The ""Splash"" actress was among more than 100 people arrested at the demonstration, according to the group that organized the protest. ""We stand here today to just say no to slavery, to just say no to tar, sands, oil, and no to the Keystone pipeline,"" Hannah said before her arrest. A representative for the actress was unaware of the arrest when contacted by CNN Tuesday afternoon. The State Department is set to issue what could be a final ruling to allow a massive new pipeline expansion from central Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico. A decision is expected by the end of the year, State Department spokeswoman Heide Fulton said at a briefing last month. Known as Keystone, the project is an expansion of an existing pipeline that now terminates in Oklahoma. Stretching over 1,600 miles -- twice the length of the Trans-Alaska system -- the new pipeline would be one of the biggest in the country. Canada's oil sands have drawn numerous critics who say the way the oil is extracted harms the environment.","A sit-in was held in front of the White House on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee on Wednesday cautioned the United States against engaging with Iran in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In an exclusive interview with CNN's Dana Bash, Sen. Robert Menendez also pushed back against criticism that lawmakers are purposefully holding off on an authorization vote until after Election Day in November. His comments came just minutes before the committee began hearing testimony from Secretary of State John Kerry on the administration's plan to combat ISIS. Obama, Kerry: No U.S. troops will be sent into combat . Kerry said Monday in Paris that the U.S. would be open to having talks with Iran on how to deal with the group. But Menendez said he has ""a problem"" with directly cooperating with Iran ""because Iran has different goals than we have."" He added the country has a history of creating ""sectarian divisions of Iraq"" and is ""is one of the patrons of (Bashar al-) Assad"" and his regime in Syria. ""I don't get how we engage with Iran in this context other than to realize that they're in the theater for their own interests,"" the New Jersey Democrat said. Pelosi stands firm against ground troops before Syrian funding . President Barack Obama said Wednesday the international community and a coalition of at least 40 nations will degrade and defeat the group, which is bent on forming a caliphate from Syria to Iraq, in which strict Islamic law, or Sharia, governs all aspects of life. The House is set to vote on a measure Wednesday to authorize the arming and training of Syrian rebels to help fight ISIS. It is expected to get folded into a bill to fund the government, meaning Congress won't vote for it as a stand-alone measure. Bash asked Menendez if he thinks that's a ""cowardly"" way to approach the situation, as it makes it easier for lawmakers up for re-election to not have to be on the record on a tough vote. ""I get it. And I'm -- and I'm ready and willing to -- I voted for a year ago, on this very same committee, to do exactly what we're doing, maybe for different purposes at the time, it was to defeat Assad,"" he said. ""I'm ready to cast that vote independently or as part of the (funding measure) myself."" Menendez said he also thinks Congress will authorize the use of military force in the region but he didn't indicate the vote would come before the midterm elections. ""It has nothing to do with the election,"" he said. ""This is all about getting it right, not getting it fast. I don't want to have another 2001 or 2003 authorization for the use of military force that has been used 13 years later in four different parts of the world. I don't want to give an open-ended blank check to this or any other president."" Ahead of Kerry's testimony Menendez said he wants to hear ""specifics"" about the plan to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. ""I am convinced we are at war with ISIS,"" he said, adding that he wants to know what ""resources"" the U.S. will use and ""who is playing what senior role"" in the effort. President Obama's top general said Tuesday it's not out of the realm of possibility -- if the situation requires it -- that the Pentagon would call for sending ground troops into Iraq to fight the terror group. On Wednesday, Obama reiterated there would be no U.S. ground troops engaging in combat in Iraq. He told service members at U.S. Central Command in Florida that troops ""do not and will not have a combat mission"" to battle ISIS. ISIS has slaughtered swaths of people in both countries, and has beheaded two American journalists and a British aid worker it held in captivity. ""We must be clear-eyed"" about the risk in engaging in a fight against ISIS, Menendez said in his opening remarks shortly after speaking with Bash. ""I want to hear what success looks like [in Syria and Iraq] after fighting comes to an end,"" the senator said.","Senate Foreign Relations Chair Menendez says he wants ""specifics"" on plan to fight ISIS .

"(CNN) -- The Hapsburg Palaces, romantic banks of the Danube and historic spas draw the crowds to Budapest, but there's a whole world underground within the city limits. Literally underground. While one half of the city, Pest, is flat, Buda's curvy hills are rich with secret labyrinths, hidden bunkers and caving adventures. There are up to 200 caves in total. Budapest's subterranean world owes its debt to the city's spas, or rather their water, which has carved out a network of caverns. Here are some of the highlights. Budapest's natural caves . One of the best things about Budapest is its proximity to nature. Less than half an hour's bus ride from downtown, where the city's outer II District turns into lush hills, there are a number of natural caves worth visiting. Beautiful crystal formations deck out the caves under Szemlo Hill, . At nearby Palvolgy, the caves are more familiar, with stalactites and stalagmites. Palvolgyi Cave, Szepvolgyi ut 162, Budapest . Szemlo Hill Caves, Pusztaszeri ut 35, Budapest (websites in Hungarian) Spelunking beneath the city . Adventurous cavers who enjoy getting dirty, wriggling through tight holes and scaling slippery walls are in luck. The Palvolgy caves actually make up the longest cave network in Hungary, running from a valley housing the showpiece caves into Budapest's Matyas Hill. Descending a metal ladder into a pit 10 meters (33 feet) below, tours emerge into a room known as the ""chapel"" that was once used as an underground place of worship. The three-hour tour gets more difficult as the air gets thinner and the passages tighter -- but the humor and encouragement of the guide makes up for the physical discomforts. Tours can be booked with an English-speaking guide for groups of more than four. Ticket price includes a guide, all necessary equipment and entrance to the caves. Palvolgyi Caving Tours, Szepvolgyi ut 162, Budapest . The Hospital in the Rock . Castle Hill, the mound overlooking the Danube that shoulders Budapest's sprawling palace complex, also holds a few subterranean treasures. Unlike the city's other caves, these passageways have been in use for centuries -- they tell a series of gruesome tales from the city's history. Located on the side of the hill, on the road winding up to the castle, the Hospital in the Rock isn't technically part of the original cave system, although it connects up with it. Once an underground hospital used in World War II, most notably during the siege of Budapest, it eventually became a secret nuclear bunker during the Cold War. The museum can be visited only on a guided tour, which runs on the hour in both English and Hungarian. Tours take visitors through tunnels into the old hospital and end up in the radiation contamination room, where they get to play with an air-raid siren. Creepy wax figures lend an air of authenticity to the horrors of the conditions experienced in wartime, when the hospital, built for only 60-70 patients, took in more than 600 wounded. Hospital in the Rock, Lovas ut 4/C, Budapest . Dracula's prison and the Labyrinth . The Labyrinth is part of the natural cave system under Castle Hill. It's shown signs of being inhabited as far back as prehistoric times, with people living there as late as the 11th and 12th centuries. Caves here have since functioned as wine cellars and masonry mines, but come wrapped in curious myths. The Turks used them for military purposes in the 16th century, but archeological evidence also hints at an underground harem. One of the Labyrinth's headline attractions is Vlad Tepes, known better as Vlad the Impaler, or Dracula, who spent a spell down here as a prisoner. Visiting the Labyrinth is a campy experience filled with waxworks dressed in old opera costumes.

The Cave Church of Gellert Hill . Gellert Hill is a landmark in Budapest. Rising above the Danube, it overlooks the whole city and guards its own cave network. Unlike the caves beneath the city's other hills, most of these are closed off. The main cave open to the public, St. Ivan's, houses a small church with an entrance facing one of Budapest's most famous spas, the Gellert Baths. Use of the cave as a church is fairly new.

"(CNN) -- If you've bought California nectarines, peaches, plums or pluots lately, even the organic kind, check the label carefully. The Wawona Packing Co. in Cutler, California, announced late last week it's expanding a voluntary recall of its products. The fruit may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterium that can cause listeriosis. This serious infection can give you temporary problems such as a high fever, abdominal pain and diarrhea, headaches, stiffness and nausea. The initial recall covered specific lots of fruit packed from June 1 through July 12. The company expanded the recall ""as a precautionary step"" by five days, to fruit packaged through July 17, in large part because it has ""yet to identify with scientific certainty the source"" of the Listeria monocytogenes at the packaging facility. It's a national voluntary recall because ""we do not know the locations of the companies or stores that received the products from our direct customers,"" according to a company statement. The company's testing initiated the recall; scientists found the bacterium on a peach and on two nectarines. How to protect yourself from food poisoning . Since the recall, no other products have been packed at the Cutler facility. The facility will stay closed until the source of the contamination has been determined. Wawona said it has brought in experts to help with the investigation, and the company is working closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Websites for Trader Joe's, Kroger, Costco, Whole Foods Market, Ralphs, Food 4 Less and Walmart, which also operates Sam's Club, initially posted notices about the problem when the first recall went out around July 19. If you do have the fruit in your fridge, look for a sticker that reads, ""Sweet2Eat."" The fruit may also be labeled Mrs. Smittcamp's or ""Sweet2Eat Organic."" Throw out the potentially contaminated fruit or take it back to the store for a refund. Whole Foods also recalled some of their made-in-store products that may have been prepared with the fruit. The store recall involved salsas, tarts, prepared salad and cakes. A full list is on FDA.gov. Products packaged after July 18 and fruit packaged outside of that one particular facility in Cutler is not affected by this recall and should be safe to eat. For people with compromised immune systems, listeriosis could be a fatal infection. Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to severe reactions to the bacterium, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths for women who are pregnant. If you have eaten one of these products, see your doctor immediately. So far, no one has reported getting sick from the fruit. Generally the CDC estimates about 260 deaths and 1,600 people get sick after eating food contaminated with listeriosis. The largest exposure to listeriosis happened in 2011 when people ate cantaloupes contaminated with the bacterium from a farm in Colorado. Nearly three dozen people died after eating the fruit, and an additional 147 people got sick. With that exception, outbreaks have been on the decline since 2001, according to the CDC. 1 dead, 7 sickened by listeria linked to cheese . 22,000 pounds of meat recalled .

"(CNN) -- Twenty years ago, Newt Gingrich and the GOP rode to power on Capitol Hill with a slick ""policy manifesto"" called the . ""Contract With America."" Today, some Republican lawmakers are calling for another such ""contract"" with the hope that they can stimulate greater interest in Republican ideas and policies. Frustrated with colleagues who seem more interested in attacking President Obama than in proposing new ideas, Sen. Lindsey Graham and others are seeking a reprise of 1994, when Gingrich's platform touted five ideas that the Republicans promised to pursue if voters gave them power in the midterm elections. But even if Republicans move forward with a new manifesto -- which some in the GOP oppose in fear of overpromising anything in an era when Washington seems incapable of doing anything -- the product would have little effect on the big problem that Republicans are facing. While Republicans stand a good chance of retaining the House and regaining control of the Senate in the midterms, polls show that the Republican brand name is in big trouble and huge portions of the electorate don't trust the party with power. This doesn't bode well for future presidential elections, when many more voters turn out than in midterms, or for their long-term fortunes on Capitol Hill. The problems facing the GOP are much bigger than anything a media-friendly set of promises can provide. Over the years, the Republicans have inflicted great damage on the image of their party. According to a new Gallup poll, the difference between conservatives and liberals on many issues has shrunk dramatically. Conservatives have lost the advantage they have enjoyed on issues such as gay rights. Gallup predicts that voters will soon be reporting themselves as more liberal on social issues than conservative if the trend continues. Even as much of the electorate has moved toward the center or even the left on social and cultural issues like gay rights and the legalization of marijuana, the official Republican Party has stood still, adhering to the ideas from the culture wars of the 1980s rather than adjusting to the realities of modern times. The same is true on immigration reform, where the party has hued to a hardline stance against a path to citizenship despite the fact that polls show strong public support for liberal legislation. There was a moment when Republicans could have moved in a different direction. When he was in the White House, President George W. Bush, through his ideas of compassionate conservatism as well as his strong advocacy of liberalized immigration policies, did push his party to move away from hardline social conservatism, focusing instead on economic and national security ideas. But he failed. Hardline Republicans blocked his agenda, while the controversies over Iraq and how he handled Hurricane Katrina undermined his political strength. The Republicans on Capitol Hill won the debate, and now the party as a whole is paying the cost. Neither have Republicans helped themselves with economic policy. Ultimately, political parties can't thrive without the support of the middle class. Republicans who have inhabited the White House in recent decades, ranging from Richard Nixon's campaign to appeal to the ""silent majority"" to Ronald Reagan's lure of disaffected Democrats, have found different ways to let voters know that they would back the middle class. Nixon railed against the tumult of the 1960s, appealing to middle-class white Americans who he said were being ignored. Even while courting business, he still accepted policies that helped them. Reagan did the same. Recently, Republicans have had more trouble making this work. Their economic policies leave many Americans feeling that they are left out of the party. This is why that ""47%"" remark of Mitt Romney in 2012 election resonated so powerfully. Republicans are still in better shape with their economic policies than on other issues, but that too is a fading advantage. They look more like the party of the 1% at a time many middle-class Americans are struggling to get by. Republicans have greatly damaged their reputation as a party that can or even wants to govern. Polls consistently show that more Americans trust Democrats than Republicans to handle the major issues of the day. The Republican strategy of obstruction has been very successful at stifling Obama and rallying support among the party faithful. Vicious attacks are a terrific way to motivate activists to get to the polls but not as good at winning broad support among more moderate and independent voters who want elected officials who can lead. Many Americans have concluded that the Republicans are more interested in obstruction than solving policy problems. Although congressional obstruction can cause great problems for the White House, as Sen. Mitch McConnell famously understood from day one of the Obama presidency, it is not a good way to build broader support for the party. It doesn't look like the adults are in control of the room when Republicans are in charge. No matter what they say, Republicans still don't look like a big parts of the American electorate. The leadership of the party is still white and still male, which does affect who voters think the candidates will support. A recent study by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University provided devastating findings for the party on this front, showing that the gender gap in terms of political candidates is huge even if Republicans have made slight, very slight, progress in recent years. There are six times as many women, the study found, representing Democrats as Republicans. The number of female Republican candidates running has declined since 2012, despite a concerted effort by the party to bring more of a gender balance to the tickets. Over time, Democrats have steadily improved (PDF) their gender diversity. All of these problems point to the fact that Republicans have some really substantial rebuilding work ahead of them in the coming years. If the party's only solution is a five-point printout, they are unlikely to find themselves overcoming the leadership gap that they face. The GOP needs to do more than make promises; the party needs to reconfigure some of its basic policy agenda to prove it hasn't become a party that has left much of the electorate behind.","20 years ago, a policy manifesto helped GOP ride to power on Capitol Hill .

"(CNN) -- Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's release from Taliban captivity was largely celebrated at first. In the ensuing days, however, several serious issues have arisen, bearing upon death, honor and the law. Were U.S. soldiers killed searching for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl? A controversy exists over whether soldiers were killed, directly or indirectly, in the search for Bergdahl after he was taken captive by the Taliban. Former soldiers involved in the operations to find Bergdahl asserted to CNN this week that at least six soldiers were killed because of the search for Bergdahl in 2009. They provided the soldiers' names and their dates of death, with circumstances for some of them. A day later, Nathan Bradley Bethea, a former member of Bergdahl's battalion who searched for him that summer in 2009, wrote in the Daily Beast that eight soldiers' deaths were tied to the Bergdahl search. Bethea provided the eight soldiers' names -- including six names that CNN earlier reported. Asked about this point, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters Wednesday that he did not know of specific circumstances or details of soldiers dying as a result of the efforts to find Bergdahl. Bergdahl's former team leader, Evan Buetow, told CNN that, ""I can't say for a fact and I don't know if there is really anyone who can prove that soldiers died on a directed mission to find Bergdahl. However every mission, especially in the following two or more months, those were directed missions. Everything after that, they were still missions that were in search of Bergdahl. ... Bergdahl leaving changed the mission."" Bowe Bergdahl: Strong, well-rounded and easy to talk to, friends say . Did Bergdahl desert? An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded that Bergdahl left his outpost deliberately and on his own free will, according to a U.S. military official briefed on the report. The official spoke to CNN Tuesday on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the information. There was no definitive finding Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something Army officials couldn't do without talking to the soldier. The investigation included interviews with members of Bergdahl's unit, none of whom reported seeing him go, the official said. It is ""unfair"" to Bergdahl and his family to presume anything about his motivations for leaving the base, Hagel said Wednesday. Secretary of the Army John McHugh said Tuesday that ""a comprehensive, coordinated"" review of Bergdahl's case will be conducted. The review ""will include speaking with Sgt. Bergdahl to better learn from him the circumstances regarding his disappearance and captivity,"" McHugh said. Earlier in the week, Hagel declined to address directly detailed questions about Bergdahl's case -- particularly accusations that he deserted, as some of his former brothers-in-arm allege. Before he went missing, Bergdahl spoke of wanting to get lost in the mountains and walking to India, his comrades said. ""I believe he totally deserted,"" said former Staff Sgt. Justin Gerleve, Bergdahl's former squad leader. Did Obama break the law? The Taliban freed Bergdahl in exchange for the U.S. release of five Taliban fighters held in Guantanamo Bay, but the Obama administration didn't tell Congress of the releases. Under law, the White House has to give a 30-day notice to Capitol Hill before any terrorists are transferred from Guantanamo. White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice defended President Obama's decision not to notify Congress. ""Given the acute urgency of the health condition of Sergeant Bergdahl, and given the President's constitutional responsibilities, it was determined that it was necessary and appropriate not to adhere to the 30-day notification requirement, because it would have potentially meant that the opportunity to get Sergeant Bergdahl would have been lost,"" Rice said. The president did indeed break the letter of the law, said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University. But there are questions about the law itself, he added. ""There's two different questions here. One is, did he violate the federal law? The answer to that is most obviously yes,"" Turley said. ""The second question is whether that law is constitutional. And the answer to that is more difficult. ""This is just a notice requirement. There are thousands of such notice requirements. And the problem with the president's argument is there's no limiting principle, that he could argue that all national security laws could fall into the same unilateral power,"" Turley said. Hillary Clinton wanted tougher deal for Bergdahl . Did Bergdahl help the Taliban? There's no evidence that Bergdahl helped the enemy directly, though he's certainly been used in Taliban propaganda. What has partly fueled this accusation is how Bergdahl reportedly had sent e-mails to his parents denouncing U.S. activities in Afghanistan, according to a 2012 story in Rolling Stone magazine. Bergdahl's former comrades also wondered if he gave the Taliban intelligence because the enemy executed ""very calculated, very methodical"" strikes after Bergdahl's disappearance, said former Army Sgt. Buetow. But a U.S. official who has been briefed on the initial Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after Bergdahl disappeared told CNN that Bergdahl's commanders referred to him as ""a good soldier"" in that report. Some of his teammates said he had expressed ""boredom"" and thought his unit was too passive and should have been ""kicking down doors,"" the official said. Taliban video shows Bowe Bergdahl's release in Afghanistan . Was Bergdahl tortured? It's too early to say how severely Bergdahl was mistreated during his five years of captivity. Officials have yet to state the findings of their medical examination of Bergdahl following his release Saturday. A Taliban propaganda video of the handover of Bergdahl showed him looking gaunt and blinking repeatedly -- as if in disbelief or shock. ""He doesn't look that bad to me,"" remarked Chris Voss, a former FBI lead international hostage negotiator, about Bergdahl's condition. Some experts speculate Bergdahl may have experienced Stockholm syndrome, in which he may have emotionally bonded with his Taliban captors over the five years. Why is his unit coming out against him? There's something new and something old motivating the former members of Bergdahl's unit to condemn him. First there were the immediate reports that Bergdahl was being hailed as a hero. Those accounts incensed the former soldiers. The comrades also remembered 2009 and how they searched for Bergdahl. ""He walked off,"" former Pfc. Jose Baggett, 27, of Chicago said. ""He left his guard post. Nobody knows if he defected or he's a traitor or he was kidnapped. What I do know is, he was there to protect us, and instead he decided to defer from America and go and do his own thing. I don't know why he decided to do that, but we spent so much of our resources, and some of those resources were soldiers' lives."" In fact, the former soldiers say they are so outraged that they are speaking out publicly at significant peril. The former servicemen said they earlier signed nondisclosure agreements about the disappearance and search for Bergdahl, but they're now violating it.

"(CNN) -- The Cannes Film festival, which kicked off Wednesday on the French Riviera, is an Olympics of cinema, where endurance matters as much as victory to the 30,000 industry insiders who attend each year. The festival was conceived in the late 1930s as a reaction against Italian dictator Benito Mussolini promoting fascist-Italian and national-socialist German films at the Venice Film Festival. Its first edition, planned in September 1939, was delayed by war till 1946 but its ideals remained the same: to show films from all over the world without prejudice of any sort. But today Cannes jostles in the crowded film industry schedules with other A-list events: Toronto (and Venice) act as Fall launchpads for the following year's awards season, while Sundance is at the vanguard of independent cinema and new talent. Meanwhile the Oscars are considered by many as the supreme accolade of the movie business. Cannes still regards itself as the grande dame of film events the world over -- but does it still matter? The festival, which this year celebrates its 67th edition, stands firmly apart -- and, some would argue, above -- the rest of the crowd. This comes in part from its original ambition, as put by the festival's first president, poet Jean Cocteau: ""The Cannes Film Festival is an apolitical no man's land, a microcosm of what the world would be like if people could make direct contact with one another and speak the same language."" For Cannes is to cinema what the motto ""liberte, egalite, fraternite"" (""liberty, egality, fraternity"") is to France: an aspiration, an ideal, an inclusive forum for all talents, old and new, coming from all over the world, and motivated by one common love: films. Without prejudices. In its early years Cannes was nothing more than a social event where stars mingled on the red carpet. Everyone smiled for the camera and everyone went home happy as almost every film received some kind of an award. Then, Cannes raised its game. First came the Palme d'Or, its top award, given in 1955 and rivaling the Oscars as the most prestigious prize in the film industry. In 1972, the festival declared its independence by setting up its own selection committee: until then, each country had chosen the films which would represent them at Cannes, as still happens with the Oscars' best foreign film category. The selection of features became more discerning, the awards became fewer in number -- and success at the festival became ever more elusive. But if the Cannes glamor of the 1950s and 1960s lingers still, the festival's reputation for passion and controversy has only increased. The entertainment industry is notorious for controlling its sometimes unruly talents, with PR agencies operating like war machines and publicity a matter of life and death at the box office. In contrast Cannes is a unique place for unleashing imagination and wildness. The mix of glamor and high art, frivolity and seriousness combine to make Cannes a temple to cinema like no other. For Cannes is where directors will throw tantrums and tell critics to go to hell in no uncertain terms; where the winner of the Palme d'Or can be booed, as happened to film-maker Maurice Pialat in 1987 when he collected the coveted prize for ""Under the Sun;"" and where a talent like Danish maverick Lars Von Trier can express sympathy at a press conference for Adolf Hitler, then apologize, then be kicked out of the festival by the organizers (he later withdrew his apology). It is also an event which has always embraced the times. In 1968, while students in Paris were rioting and building barricades, the enfants terribles of the French New Wave -- including François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard -- canceled the awards ceremony and turned the festival into a giant marketplace. In 2004, Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" -- which criticized U.S. foreign policy -- became the first documentary to win the Palme d'Or from a festival jury which numbered more Americans than French. For directors and actors, success at Cannes is the Nobel Prize that they secretly covet. And for the 2,500 or so film critics -- who for 12 days start watching their first film at 8am and their last one just after midnight -- it is the most frantic and rewarding time, when masterpieces are seen for the first time and talents speak freely. Q. Can art really get any more expensive? A. 'We will see a billion dollar work' Can any train ride match the Orient Express for glamor and sheer romance?

"(CNN) -- Calling their grit, resiliency and sense of community an inspiration to all Americans, President Barack Obama promised Tuesday that those impacted by last month's deadly landslide in Washington won't be forgotten -- least of all by the federal government. Speaking in Oso, a small community about 60 miles northeast of Seattle that was ground zero for disaster, Obama outlined the ways the government has already helped and will continue to do so. He said that he wanted to visit the area to show support for ""families who are searching for loved ones (and) families who have lost everything."" ""I just wanted to let you know that the country is thinking about all of you, and have throughout this tragedy,"" the President said. ""We're not going anywhere. We'll be here as long as it takes."" Obama spoke exactly one month after the rain-saturated hillside along the Stillaguamish River gave way, unleashing walls of mud that swallowed up roads and homes in and around Oso. First responders, Washington National Guard members and volunteers quickly converged on the traumatic scene, digging through mud, logs and debris 70 feet thick in some places hoping to find the missing. Authorities on Monday put the death toll from the landslide at 41, though that number could rise as the search continues. The President noted that while few knew of Oso before last month, many since have ""been inspired by the incredible way that they community has come together and shown love and support that they have for other in ways big and small."" That might include risking their lives volunteering to find neighbors, providing a meal to those on the front lines or offering up chain saws or rain jackets. ""One resident said, 'We're Oso, and we just do it,' "" Obama said after touring the damage and meeting with various people involved in the search-and-rescue operations as well as relatives whose loved ones died. The debris field is full of toxic sludge, including human waste and toxic chemicals from households, oil and gas, according to Lt. Richard Burke of the Bellevue Fire Department. During the rescue efforts, some workers have come down with dysentery. The work seems never-ending, and the piles of debris and muck remain high a month after the mudslide. But thanks to workers' efforts, water that was 6 feet deep has now drained, making it easier for heavy equipment to navigate the still tricky terrain. One spruce tree that remained standing after the mudslide is now a memorial to the victims and a source of strength to the workers. Obama came to Washington state on the way to a four-country tour to Asia. He will stop in Malaysia, where the mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and its scores of passengers remains unsolved, and South Korea, where a ferry full of high schoolers collapsed last week. The President didn't refer to either of those disasters in his comments Tuesday. But he did laud the response of those in and around Oso for symbolizing what is best his own country. ""This is ... what America is all about,"" Obama said. ""When times get tough, we look out for each other. We get each others' backs. And we recover, and we build, and we come back stronger.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- With a population of 1.3 billion, you'd think that there would be 11 people in China who are good enough to put up a fight on the football pitch. But apparently not. Since 2002, the last -- and only -- time it made it to the World Cup finals, Team China has struggled internationally. A nadir came in June last year, when the side lost a home game 5-1 against a Thai side made up largely of youth team players. Their sorry showing on the football pitch is cause for despair, ridicule and frustration. It's not for lack of trying, however. Imported pedigree . It's often considered an issue of leadership, with flashy, expensive foreign hires typically made to steer the national team. In 2011, amid towering expectations, ex-Real Madrid legend Jose Antonio Camacho was appointed. He was tasked leading China to the 2014 World Cup, but was instead sacked two years later, following that humiliation at the hands of the Thais. With that result, it was considered that he'd left the team worse off than when he started. To make matters worse, the Spaniard was then handed a $4 million severance package. Others say it's the national league that is to blame. Trailing far behind Europe's top leagues in the popularity stakes, the Chinese Super League has again looked outside for help. In order to boost the profile -- and credibility, following a string of attendance-sapping scandals -- of the country's national league, David Beckham, was recruited to boost China's footballing spirit. The former Manchester United and England star is the closest thing the sport has to royalty, and enjoys a fanatic following in the mainland; it was hoped that some of his stardust would rub off on the Super League. Cash injections . Another recent push came in the form of the creation of the Evergrande International Football School, which claims to be the world's largest sporting academy. Property tycoon Xu Jiayin, who owns China's most successful club, Guangzhou Evergrande F.C., opened the school in late 2012 to incubate young football talent on a 167-acre campus. Despite these moves, industry insiders say China is a long way from making it back to the World Cup. Disproportionately tiny pool . ""Success in football is directly related to the population of football players,"" says Rowan Simons, chairman of China Club Football, one of Beijing's biggest sports networks. The club allows thousands of amateurs -- both Chinese and expatriates -- to play the game every week. Simons has been in China, and playing football there, for 20 years. He is arguably one of the most invested people in the grassroots development of the sport there. He says that, statistically, one great footballer will emerge out of every 200,000 players. Right now, China has anywhere between 7,000 and 50,000 kids involved in football, according to the Chinese Football Association. This compares to nearly four million in the UK. According to these calculations, ""China is likely to have one quarter of a world-class player,"" says Simons. Despite the enormous pool from which to select players, growing the footballing population is an huge task. The nation may be crazy about watching the game, but when it comes to playing it, there are hesitations. ""It isn't just China, many countries in Asia do not have a football culture,"" says Tom Byer, an American former professional who, in 2012, was appointed Head Technical Adviser for the Chinese School Football Program Office and Official CSF Grassroots Ambassador. Grassroots development . He is currently developing a unique nationwide football program for kindergartens, which will be announced in the fall. He believes that pre-school kids as young as two years old can begin to become familiar with the game. Byer is often credited for making the Japanese team the top Asian contender that it is today, and Chinese football authorities hope that he will have a similarly positive impact. However, it takes more than just appointing coaches or bringing in top stars, he says. ""The only way to really make a change is by empowering the kids and educating the parents. The best players in the world, such as (Cristiano) Ronaldo or (lionel) Messi, they learned technical skills with no coach,"" he says. ""It's not a secret that parents think of sport as a distraction to education."" Not just about the sport . He argues that youth involved in sport are more successful, and develop as more rounded, confident individuals. ""We shouldn't convince people to play sport just to become professional, we should be focusing on sport as a lifestyle."" Simons agrees that kids are key. He says that the reach of elite football schools, such as Evergrande's new academy, is not sufficient to have the required impact. The coach imagines an ideal future where grassroots football takes off in China, with community-based football clubs in the European mold taking the lead. When he started it 13 years ago, his club was previously exclusively made up of expatriate children. Now, with 3,000 kids on the books, 60% of them are Chinese. The turning point, he says, was when parents realized that learning the sport would have other benefits. Simons used English language learning through playing football, as his foreign coaches would speak English to the budding footballers. Parents, in turn, hope that the environment will help their little ones learn the international language faster. ""When the kids start playing, they fall in love with the game, and parents see benefits not just of learning English, but also of coordination, fitness, teamwork, loyalty,"" he says. He adds that he had a tough time convincing parents of the positives of football, which in China is associated with cheating and match-fixing.. Green shoots of hope . Henry Wang and his nine-year-old son Andy have been with China Club Football for three years. ""Because of the one child policy, it is important for Andy to learn how to be with other kids and to learn team spirit, football can teach that,"" says Wang. ""Football has given him a lot of confidence."" His son, who is in grade three, is currently one of the top three students in his class. Teen players should also be prioritized, says Byers. He argues that more investment should be made at the bottom of the football hierarchy, instead of boosting only the top professional players. ""The buzz right now should be around the AFC (Asian Football Confederation) under-16 tournament, as this will put (the team) in the under-17 FIFA World Cup, and from there everything will fall into place."" It may end up being a little more complicated than that, but as China looks as if it's finally ready to embrace change from the ground up, it may not be long until the Chinese national team once again graces the biggest stage of all.","Despite China's massive population, the country falls far short in terms of footballing prowess .

"(CNN) -- A debate is raging over the tragic case of Justin Ross Harris, who left his 22-month-old boy, Cooper, in a car all day. Cooper perished, and now his father has been charged with murder and child cruelty. Some people call this a tragedy, and some call it a crime. Who is right? Harris will appear in court Thursday to face a probable cause hearing in which the prosecution will try to convince a judge that it was indeed a crime. The defense will likely try to show that Harris' act was simple negligence. Either way, the focus will be on why Cooper was left in the car -- and although this seems counterintuitive -- for the purposes of the criminal proceedings, the tragic death will not be material for determining guilt. To make the case that Harris committed premeditated first-degree murder by intentionally leaving his child in a car to die, the justice system will need to look at his prior history, both criminal and psychological, and consider any other acts that show a complete disregard -- or worse -- for the child. We should see some previous behavior consistent with his ability to act as one of the worst that we identify in our society: people capable of killing their own children. This behavior could include anger at the child or the child's mother, pending divorce litigation, frustration at an illness the child suffers, financial distress or other stressful situations. The defense and the prosecution and law enforcement have to examine these considerations quickly. If they decide that Harris is not the worst among us -- if he is not someone guilty of filicide -- then the alternative is one of negligence. In this case, the cause of ""just forgetting his child in a car"" needs to be analyzed. We as humans often want to reassess our decisions based upon the outcome. Deciding to stay late at work and then being involved in a major accident on the way home puts focus on whether or not you should have stayed late. Splurging for dessert after dinner and getting hit by a car while crossing the street suggests the dessert was significant. The reality is when that decision is made, it is almost always inconsequential. Nobody would have considered it significant if Harris had walked 10 paces away from his car toward his work and then remembered Cooper. The fact that a simply negligent mistake had devastating consequences does not, logically or rationally, make the act grossly negligent or criminal in and of itself. CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin bravely confessed in an opinion piece that she once left her child in the car, something she realized in horror a few moments later. Her baby was fine. It was simple negligence. If Harris' mistake was one of simple negligence, that he truly just forgot to drop Cooper off at day care, then the question is: Should we make a simply negligent act that has significant consequences a criminal act because of those consequences? That is an extraordinarily dangerous precedent to set. Thousands of cars get in accidents every day, most caused by simple negligence. Some are fender benders, some cause significant property damage, some cause simple injuries, some cause significant injuries and some end up with people dying. Our law is well settled in that context -- it is the negligent act that we focus on and not primarily the result. One concept that we use in all of our jurisprudence is the reasonable man theory. That is, most people are presumed to act in a reasonable way, with the term reasonable determined by our societal norms. We judge each other in many circumstances based upon whether or not we've acted reasonably. The reasonable man concept appears in other aspects of criminal law. In self-defense cases, we seek to find if a person had reasonable fear of great bodily harm or death. In civil cases, such as in personal injury law, the difference between simple negligence and gross negligence has huge implications on a plaintiff's chances to be awarded damages -- no matter how severely he or she suffered. To change a well-settled principle of law -- that we are to be judged on whether we acted reasonably or negligently independently from the consequences -- would be a dangerous alteration in the way we interact, not only in the court system, but as a society. Harris probably acted with simple negligence. If he did, he will deal with having been the cause of his son's death for the rest of his life, but he should not be held criminally liable. There is one other possibility to consider. If Harris showed a reckless disregard for the consequences of his actions or a blatant indifference to his legal duties, then he may be guilty of gross negligence. If it is determined that Harris acted in a grossly negligent way, then he should be held criminally responsible. If the facts came forward that he left his son in the car because he was drunk, or because he wanted to go out and party, then a criminal negligence standard would be easy to reach. If I drive my car in a school zone five miles over the speed limit, and run over and kill a child, I am probably only acting in a simply negligent way. If I do so at 70 mph, I would be acting grossly negligently, and should be held criminally liable. We've all been quick to judge Harris, and we're going to have to wait for all the facts to come out before we can make an informed opinion. In this case, making an informed opinion means making a reasoned assessment regarding whether Harris acted on purpose, or whether it was negligence. We just have to be careful not to allow the tragic consequences of the act to influence how we judge the act itself.","Justin Ross Harris has been charged with murder, child cruelty after son died in hot car .
Mark O'Mara: We need to look at any prior behavior that shows complete disregard for son .
O'Mara: If there's none, we look at negligence; ""forgetting child"" needs to be analyzed .
He says it's wrong to judge a negligent act by consequences, no matter how bad ."
"(CNN) -- The voice from the top of Formula One is ominous: . ""Susie Wolff is good -- but will she ever be in a position to show how good she is?"" mused F1's supreme leader Bernie Ecclestone in March. ""I doubt it."" For any team boss deciding whether to give a shot to a female driver, the evidence is clear. In the 50 years since a woman first stepped behind the wheel of an F1 car, the sum total of their achievements is half a championship point. Surely, say F1's top men, there's a reason why a woman can't race with the boys. Wolff, a development driver for the Williams team who is hoping to become the elite motorsport's first female competitor in 20 years, has always been told why she won't make it. From fragile necks to lack of grit, team bosses and F1 luminaries have lined up to give their two cents about the female frailties that have prevented a woman driver from making the breakthrough into regular racing action. Giovanna Amati, the last to enter the championship in 1992, did not start a race. Maria de Villota had seemed set to become the next, but suffered serious injuries in a crash during her first testing session for the Marussia team in 2012, and she died just 15 months later. Two years after the Spaniard's crash, all eyes will be on Wolff when she takes part in practice sessions at the British and German grands prix in July for the Williams team. The big question is, can a woman ever beat the boys at their own game? 'She doesn't have the strength' ""I know that women have around 30% less muscle than men,"" says Wolff. ""And it was always one of the big reasons people said to me that I wouldn't be successful in F1 -- because I simply wouldn't be strong enough."" Former F1 chief doctor Gary Hartstein had a first-hand taste of the physical demands -- and neck-breaking sustained 3.5G cornering forces -- while being taken for five laps in McLaren's two-seater F1 car. ""I thought: if we were doing six laps, I'd have to press the button that tells them 'I don't want to do this anymore!' because my neck hurt so bad,"" he recalls. Any driver, male or female, will need to undergo a grueling course of training to bulk up on core and upper body strength if they are to stand a chance of fighting for grand prix podiums. But after all that, won't women still trail behind the men? ""In terms of strength: No. Forget it. There's no hindrance there,"" Hartstein says. ""That level of core and upper body strength is available to any woman that is prepared to put in the time."" It's not something you need to tell Wolff. She says any doubts she had before her 89-lap test session at Silverstone last year faded fast. ""Already on my first lap out of the pits I knew it was going to be manageable,"" she says. ""I think we are at a slight disadvantage in terms of physical strength but it's something that can be overcome and it's something that won't stop us being successful in F1."" 'She won't be able to handle the pressure' When 84-year-old racing legend Stirling Moss aired his thoughts about ""ladies"" driving in F1, he had no doubts that they could achieve the strength. He only worried they lacked the concentration, focus and ""mental aptitude"" to ""race hard, wheel-to-wheel"" with the top men. Wolff's response was to ""cringe."" For her -- and many other observers -- the comments seemed typical of the offhand chauvinism which she has brushed aside on her way to the top levels of the sport. ""I think we're in a different generation,"" she courteously put it. But new evidence suggests not all stereotypes about the gender's mental makeup are without justification. Hartstein considers the common one: that women are more maternal and men are more aggressive. ""I would have laughed about that a few years ago,"" he says. ""But I think science is beginning to realize that the human brain and human behavior is dramatically affected by sex. ""There are behaviors that you can look at cross-culturally ... in general, men are more reckless more brazen, more risk-taking."" These gender-based differences in the brain could, in theory, he says, have an impact on those character traits that are necessary to succeed in motorsport, and to succeed on the track in any given race. But there is nothing to say any individual female driver will not match the aggression levels of even the most hot-headed male drivers, Hartstein says -- or indeed that calmer strategies will not ultimately prevail. And to put this unknown in context of the things we do know: when it comes to maintaining super-human levels of focus and concentration, female drivers have got all that it takes to challenge in F1, he insists. Hartstein contends that this, too, has a basis in the physical and we can say from tests in marathon performance -- as a marker of aerobic conditioning -- that the best women are as good as the best men. For Wolff, all the talk of aerobic conditioning and gender based differences is just academic. ""I'm incredibly lucky to be in a sport where when I put a helmet on and am out on the track, it doesn't matter what my gender is, all that matters is my performance -- and that's what it always comes down to in sport actually, your performance,"" the 31-year-old says. 'She'll never get the cash' But for Ecclestone, there's more to it than that. Inevitably, there's also the question of money. ""The big problem with a woman, even if she's good enough, is having the opportunity to show that,"" Ecclestone said in an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald. ""Because a team won't take a woman driver unless they bring them massive sponsorship."" With all the positive publicity that has surrounded Wolff's rise and rise, you'd think that advertisers would be falling over themselves to be associated with her. ""Generally speaking, women in sport are certainly an attractive proposition for sponsors as they are often seen as more likeable and trusted, compared to their male counterparts,"" agrees Nigel Geach, senior vice-president of motorsport at market research company Repucom. But consider Williams' chief sponsor Martini: would its advertising -- heavy on retro ""Mad Men""-style imagery and male seduction fantasies -- make sense with a no-nonsense female driver behind the wheel? Geach talks about ""new examples of sponsorship activation"" -- new, less macho brands becoming involved with the sport's female drivers. But, there's a catch: . ""Drivers must first convince investors that they are capable of vying for the points during the F1 season,"" he says. Understandably, no brand wants their name to be seen on the side of a last-place car -- but this is a promise that can rarely be given, even when a prospective competitor has cleaned up in other race categories. Add to that the sport's danger -- made clear by the tragic crash suffered by de Villota, once the most visible female face of F1, before her death last year -- and here the inevitable boon of publicity works against a trailblazing woman driver. If everyone's watching you, no-one will miss you pulling in last, or getting hurt. Whether Wolff is the woman to show that female drivers really can be banked on, no-one wants to guess. But she is happy to show patience and wait for a chance to come her way: . ""There's no pushing women in to get the quota higher, it's simply happening in an organic way,"" says the Scot -- who is married to Toto Wolff, executive director at the dominant F1 team this season, Mercedes, and a shareholder at Williams. ""I think what it takes now is for women to be on the grid, racing. Little girls will be inspired by that and get racing, then you get the best girls rising to the top, and that's when you get future champions.""

"(CNN) -- It's been a busy few days in the world of cybercrime. Late last week, we learned that cooperation between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and overseas police agencies led to the dissection of the amorphous network behind Blackshades -- the tool that allows hackers to remotely access an unwitting user's computer to steal sensitive files, log passwords, and capture webcam images. Law enforcement authorities from the U.S. to Germany to the Netherlands appeared on the doorsteps of suspected hackers with links to the malicious software, eventually arresting 90 people and gathering hoards of evidence along the way. Then, on Monday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder released an indictment for five Chinese nationals on charges of corporate cybertheft. In a statement, FBI Director James B. Comey accused the Chinese government of committing ""cyber espionage to obtain economic advantage for its state-owned industries."" The 31-count cybertheft indictment is the first of its kind to level penalties on a state actor -- in this case five members of the People's Liberation Army -- for allegedly pilfering intellectual property from six U.S. companies. Predictably, China's Foreign Ministry was quick to rebuke the charges as ""fabricated"" and a violation ""of basic norms of international relations."" As if it had been pre-written, the scripted statement then touted China's record as a ""staunch defender of cybersecurity."" Practically speaking, the arrest of 90 semi-amateur hackers is hardly a decisive blow to global cybercrime and the Justice Department's indictment is little more than a legal show of force. After all, the Blackshades network pales in comparison to other high-dealing cybercrime rings and China has already dismissed the allegations as ""fictitious and absurd,"" so don't expect extradition proceedings anytime soon. But the Blackshades arrests and the DOJ allegations against China, although modest, are hardly trivial. The indictment marks the most flagrant expression of the United States' growing intolerance for corporate cybertheft to date. It also communicates to China and the rest of the world the degree to which such behavior directly threatens America's interests, perhaps even in a manner commensurate with more conventional threats like terrorism and WMD proliferation. More than signaling intolerance for cybercrime, both cases have revealed domestic and foreign law enforcement's steady maturation in this space. The international Blackshades raid, which spanned 19 countries, required robust information sharing channels and cross-border operational coordination. On the surface, such partnerships seem routine given that the U.S. regularly partners with foreign law enforcement on drug, terrorism, and financial crimes. But unlike other criminal disciplines, there are no universally-recognized charters governing international norms for cybercrime, and most countries' justice systems are at drastically different stages of development in this nascent legal field. The Feds and their international counterparts deserve a solid pat on the back for this one, but the progress will quickly retreat if the events of the past week don't trigger a more enduring dialogue on international norms for cybercrime. Now more than ever, the line in the sand is clear. On one side is traditional espionage, a practice governed by hundreds of years of international norms that has recently spilled over from sea, air and land into cyberspace. It is a basic function of intelligence. On the other side, is corporate cybertheft, a new phenomenon in which the anonymity of cyberspace affords the thief an enormous advantage over the victim -- especially when the thief is a government and the victim is a business. Quite simply, corporate cybertheft crosses the line because, in today's ultra-competitive geopolitical landscape, it threatens the delicate balance of power between states. Yes, states spy in cyberspace to protect themselves from threats. But the goal of corporate cybertheft is to fundamentally revise the balance of power -- and self-respecting nations simply can't tolerate such behavior. In unprecedented fashion, the faces of five officers from the previously disclosed 61398 Unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army now appear on a ""Wanted by the FBI"" poster, a striking suggestion that perhaps prosecuting cybercrime shouldn't differ all that much from prosecuting other crimes. Not too long ago, the overt portrayal of individuals otherwise known only by their virtual aliases would have been met by fierce opposition from those fearing diplomatic retribution. Despite China's rhetoric and the summoning of the American Ambassador to China Max Baucus Monday night, the U.S. need not fear retribution. But now that we've crossed the Rubicon with this indictment, it's apparent that dealing with cybercrime is more than just a ""name and shame"" game.

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles Clippers co-owner Donald Sterling made it clear Friday that he wasn't going away, suing the NBA for more than $1 billion for its decision to ban him for life and force him to sell the franchise. The lawsuit -- which was provided to CNN by Sterling's lawyer and wasn't unexpected -- marks the latest twist in a case that began last month when TMZ posted a recording in which Sterling made racist comments. It also comes amid fresh questions about the 80-year-old's mental state, raising the issue of how much control he has or should have with the Clipppers. Sterling's inflammatory remarks to his companion, V. Stiviano, spawned outrage among NBA fans, players and executives. Chief among the latter was NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who banned Sterling from the league, fined him $2.5 million and pushed through a charge to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise. Sterling's camp, in its lawsuit, claims that the move to terminate his ownership ""is unconstitutional, in breach of contract, in restraint of trade, in breach of fiduciary duties and ... is malicious and oppressive."" Among other allegations, Sterling says in the lawsuit that he never violated the NBA's constitution and that the recording that spawned this scandal -- and that recording, it says, is the sole base of the NBA charges against him -- is against California law. The lawsuit also states that ""the forced sale of the Los Angeles Clippers threatens not only to produce a lower price than a non-forced sale, but more importantly, it injures competition and forces antitrust injury by making the ... market unresponsive to ... the operation of the free market."" ""(Sterling believes) that the NBA's forced sale ... would create damages of at least $1 billion, which includes capital gains taxes, unnecessary and increased investment-banking fees, legal and transactional costs, and the loss of all future appreciation in the Los Angeles Clippers franchise value,"" it adds. The filing in a federal court in California comes a day after Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly, agreed to sell the Clippers to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for $2 billion. It also comes days before the NBA Board of Governors had been set for a vote that could have forced the Sterlings to give up that team. The NBA said Friday that the June 3 meeting has been canceled -- something Sterling himself had asked for in his lawsuit -- due to the Clippers' pending sale to Ballmer. On Friday, former Time Warner CEO and current interim Clippers CEO Dick Parsons spoke to CNN affiliate KTLA about the team's sale. ""I hope obviously this thing goes through, the sooner this thing is resolved, the better for everybody, the league, the Sterlings, certainly for the team and for the staff, to have some certainty around who's going to own the team going forward and sort of pick up on the momentum that the team has built towards the end of the season. I think it's a big plus,"" Parsons said. In an interview with CNN's Jason Carroll on Friday, Clippers guard J.J. Redick said he feels that the new ownership will cement a team on its way up. ""We're on the verge of doing something great,"" Redick said. He added that ""as a professional athlete, you always have distractions,"" but ""you never want to be part of a national scandal."" Redick also said that a quick resolution is what he hopes for. ""As a player and as a franchise, you want finality,"" Redick said. However, Friday's lawsuit seems to indicate that a quick resolution may not happen. ""The NBA, Shelly Sterling and the Sterling Family Trust today resolved their dispute over the ownership of the Los Angeles Clippers,"" the NBA said in a statement. ""Mrs. Sterling and the Trust also agreed not to sue the NBA and to indemnify the NBA against lawsuits from others, including from Donald Sterling."" The lawsuit filed Friday listed Donald Sterling and the Sterling family trust as plaintiffs. That fact speaks to yet another aspect of this story that's up in the air: Who controls the Sterling family trust, which is the official owner of the Clippers? Lawyer: Sterling 'doesn't want to fight' with estranged wife . The question of whether Donald Sterling has standing over the NBA franchise doesn't just have to do with his racist comments but, more generally, his mental state. Two neurologists have deemed Donald Sterling to be mentally incapacitated, two sources with detailed knowledge of the situation told CNN on Friday. Sterling's lawyer, Maxwell Blecher, firmly shot down this report, calling such a declaration a ""vast overstatement."" Blecher said the 80-year-old was diagnosed with a ""modest mental impairment"" or a ""slowing down."" ""(Sterling is) far from incapacitated,"" his lawyer said. According to one of the sources, there is a provision in the Sterling family trust that says if either Donald Sterling or his estranged wife, Shelly Sterling, become mentally incapacitated, then the other becomes the sole trustee. That could smooth the way for the deal that Shelly Sterling negotiated with Ballmer. So, too, could something Sterling acknowledged in his lawsuit Friday: that another of his lawyers wrote a letter to the NBA on May 20 stating that ""Mr. Sterling agrees to the sale of his interest in the Los Angeles Clippers."" ""This letter confirms that Donald T. Sterling authorizes Rochelle Sterling to negotiate with the National Basketball Association regarding all issues in connection with a sale of the Los Angeles Clippers team,"" lawyer Doug Walton wrote. Where does Sterling stand, then, on whether the team should be sold? His lawsuit makes clear that he believes the NBA has no right to force such a sale, just as the league was wrong in banning him for life and fining him. In addition to damages, the lawsuit seeks a restraining order. It also acknowledges the $2 billion agreement that his estranged wife reached with Ballmer. Asked about such a sale on Friday, before the Board of Governors meeting was canceled, Blecher said that Donald Sterling ""is looking at the whole situation and evaluating where to go from here."" ""He doesn't want to fight with Shelly. That's the bottom line,"" Blecher said. Sterlings could make huge profit . Whatever happens with Sterling's lawsuit, there's no question that, if the sale goes through, it would mean a huge windfall for him and his family. The real estate investor bought the Clippers for about $12 million in 1981. Three-quarters of the NBA Board of Governors would have to OK any deal with Ballmer. If they do at the agreed-upon price, it would be the largest sum paid for an NBA franchise by far. Last month, the Milwaukee Bucks, a team with a losing record in a small television market, sold for $550 million. In a statement earlier Friday, Shelly Sterling confirmed the deal with Ballmer and how it would revamp the team's ownership. ""We have worked for 33 years to build the Clippers into a premiere NBA franchise,"" she said in a statement. ""I am confident that Steve will take the team to new levels of success."" Who is Steve Ballmer? The Sterling's would-be successor as owner, Ballmer, is worth $20 billion, according to Forbes magazine. Ballmer was recently involved in an unsuccessful effort to buy the Sacramento Kings and move them to Seattle, near where Microsoft is based. But in a statement Friday, he indicated that the Clippers would stay in Southern California. ""I love basketball. And I intend to do everything in my power to ensure that the Clippers continue to win -- and win big -- in Los Angeles,"" Ballmer said Friday. How Ballmer's $2 billion Clippers deal could pay off .

"(CNN) -- After the inquisition, the exhibition -- or an exhibition game at the very least. At the Stade de France in Paris, those who once ruled the world took their first steps towards redemption. Call it pigeon steps but this was more evolution rather than revolution. While a new generation of Spanish players may have taken to the field, the result proved to be the same. Not one single shot on target and only a few fleeting moments of encouragement, this will not be a night where those who had hoped for progress will feel reassured. Loic Remy's 73rd minute strike condemned Spain to defeat as those in red struggled to escape the shadow which has been cast upon them since their chastening World Cup experience. It was on a Friday night on June 20 inside Rio de Janeiro's iconic Maracana Stadium where the football's landscape shifted in a seismic measure which so few had predicted. For so long, Spain had danced around the world like a matador teasing a bull, showing its opponent the ball before moving it away with a style and swagger which delighted so many. Its brand of 'tiki-taka' brought success -- the 2010 World Cup sandwiched in between victories at the 2008 and 2012 European Championship finals. But in Brazil it imploded. The warning signs had been there. The Confederations Cup, which was held in Brazil 12 months before the World Cup, gave a glimpse of what was to follow. An embarrassing 3-0 defeat in the final against the host nation should have caused some sort of rethink from Vicente Del Bosque, the man who has presided over the most successful period in his nation's history. And yet it did not come. The opening World Cup game against the Dutch was a sobering affair -- a game in where Spain was fortunate to get one in a 5-1 defeat. Against Chile, where it needed a performance to prove its doubters wrong and protect its legacy, it barely managed to raise itself beyond a whimper. But that episode has passed -- and those who once wore the red with such distinction have also moved on. Xavi Hernandez, the man whose metronomic passing allowed the supporting orchestra to perform with such an overwhelming crescendo, has retired, as too have Carles Puyol and Xabi Alonso. Iker Casillas, the goalkeeper who endured a dismal World Cup, was forced to sit on the bench, while Gerard Pique, the Barcelona defender, was not even included in the squad. No, this time Del Bosque gave an opportunity to those who may yet come to be Spain's future. Koke, the Atletico Madrid midfielder, one of the outstanding stars of La Liga last season, began in midfield alongside club teammate Raul Garcia, while Athletic Bilbao's Mikel San Jose started in defense. But in a disjointed first half, it was those who were absent which perhaps emerged with greater credit. The genius of Andres Iniesta, sidelined with a hip injury was sorely missed while the attacking threat posed by normal full-back Jordi Alba was sacrificed for the more defensive minded Cesar Azpilicueta. But against a France team which will host the European Championship finals in two years time, this new look Spanish side struggled to create any real opportunities. France, which exited the World Cup at the quarterfinal stage following a disappointing performance against eventual champion Germany, fielded a strong side which included Karim Benzema, the Real Madrid forward. Twice in the first half Benzema tested David de Gea in the Spanish goal but on each occasion the Manchester United man was equal to the task. The second half began in similar fashion to the first -- with France on top and playing a sense of freedom, a joie de vivre which Spain could only wish it possessed. Benzema appeared to have given his side the lead after sweeping the ball home following good work by Moussa Sissoko but the offside flag dampened any celebrations. Spain made changes in the second half with the ineffective Diego Costa, so lethal for Chelsea in the English Premier League, making way along with Cesc Fabregas. But even with the introduction of Valencia's Paco Alcacer and Barcelona's Pedro, the visiting side failed to create anything of note. And when France carved out an opportunity with 17 minutes remaining it was duly taken by Remy, who lashed home Mathieu Valbuena's pullback from 10-yards. That goal did serve to awaken Spain from its slumber, David Silva firing inches wide of the far post after neat interplay with Pedro. It was only with the introduction of Silva that Spain looked capable of piecing something together, though when it did, the French defense stood firm. Defeat was not only deserved but it gave the impression that Del Bosque has still not solved his side's problems. Macedonia awaits in Madrid on Monday in the opening qualification game for the 2016 European Championship finals -- there can be no more room for error. Italy success . Elsewhere, Antonio Conte made a successful start to his reign as Italy manager with a 2-0 win over the Netherlands in Bari. Ciro Immobile and Daniel de Rossi scored the goals for the home side against a Dutch team which played for 81 minutes with 10 men after Bruno Martins Indi was sent off. In Sweden, Zlatan Ibrahimovic became his country's leading goalscorer after netting his 49th and 50th goals in a 2-0 win over Estonia. In Liege, Belgium defeated Australia 2-0, while Croatia overcame Cyprus 2-0 and Bosnia eased to a 3-0 win over Liechtenstein.","France defeats Spain 1-0 in Paris .

"(CNN) -- Bullets were pinging off our armor, all over our vehicle, and you could hear multiple RPGs being fired, soaring through the air every which way and impacting all around us. All sorts of crazy insane Hollywood explosions were going off. I've never felt fear like this. I was like, this is it, I'm going to die. Army machine gunner Colby Buzzell posted unfiltered blog entries from Iraq about his combat experiences. When U.S. Army machine gunner Colby Buzzell began blogging about his combat experiences from a military base in Mosul, Iraq, he wasn't looking for attention or trouble. Buzzell just wanted a way to chronicle what he saw and did and felt during the Iraq war. But his visceral, first-hand accounts were a bracing antidote to dry news reports and bloodless Pentagon news releases. In the first major war of the Internet age, Buzzell and other soldier bloggers in Iraq offered readers around the world unfiltered, real-time glimpses of an ongoing conflict. ""Here's a soldier in a combat zone ... writing about it and posting it on the Internet. I don't think that's ever been done in previous wars,"" Buzzell said. ""It just provides another perspective that no embedded journalist can ever do,"" said the veteran, now a freelance writer in San Francisco, California, and the author of ""My War: Killing Time in Iraq."" ""An embedded journalist is just there observing. But a soldier writing about it -- you can't get more embedded than that.""  See an interview with Buzzell » . A suburban skateboarder with punk-rock sensibilities, Buzzell had no background in creative writing before he joined the Army in 2002. Inspired by a Marine buddy and burned out by a string of dead-end jobs, he signed up after a smooth-talking recruiter offered a signing bonus and sold him on the Army ""like it was some [expletive] Club Med vacation."" When Buzzell arrived in Iraq in November 2003, he didn't know what a blog was. But after he read an article about a blogger in Time magazine in June 2004, he began posting anonymous journal entries on the Web under the nickname CBFTW (Colby Buzzell F--- The War). ""The only writing I knew how to do was ... like I was telling a story to the person next to me,"" he said. ""I'd go to the Internet cafe [at the Army base], and my ears would still be ringing from whatever the experience [was] that day. There were times when I couldn't type fast enough."" Over the next six weeks, Buzzell wrote brutally frank, profanity-laced posts about the terror, tedium and misadventures of an infantryman's life in Iraq. At first, few people seemed to notice. But word spread, and before long he was getting hundreds of e-mails a day from readers. Parents of troops in Iraq wrote to thank him for helping them understand their children's wartime perspective. One reader said they found Buzzell's blog more informative than the war coverage in The New York Times. Buzzell even heard from a sympathetic Iraqi in Baghdad who prayed for his safe return to America. But almost nobody -- not even Buzzell's wife -- knew that he was the blogger. Then came August 4, 2004. Mosul erupted in gunfire, and Buzzell's platoon survived an ambush by swarms of black-clad insurgents wielding rocket-propelled grenades. Buzzell witnessed his platoon sergeant survive a bullet through his helmet and narrowly missed being killed himself. The next day, Buzzell went online and found a few brief news reports of the firefight that killed at least 22 Iraqi insurgents and civilians. In his mind, the stories didn't begin to capture what happened. So he wrote a long blog post, titled ""Men in Black,"" about the ambush. I observed a man, dressed all in black with a terrorist beard, jump out all of sudden from the side of a building, he pointed his AK-47 barrel right at my f------ pupils, I froze and then a split second later, I saw the fire from his muzzle flash leaving the end of his barrel and brass shell casings exiting the side of his AK as he was shooting directly at me. I heard and felt the bullets whiz literally inches from my head. The ""Men in Black"" post attracted media attention, and Buzzell was flooded with e-mails and interview requests from around the world. Based on his descriptions of the Mosul attacks, his commanding officers soon figured out that he was the blog's author. The Army confined Buzzell to the base and began monitoring his posts. Then, after he posted an anti-Iraq war rant by Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra, they ordered him to stop blogging. Buzzell's Iraq blog lasted just 10 weeks, but it helped pave the way for others to follow. Today, according to the Army, thousands of active-duty soldiers write some form of online journal, often known as a military blog or ""milblog."" Pentagon security policy forbids soldiers to publish sensitive information, such as unit locations or the timing of military operations, that might put troops in harm's way. But beyond that, soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan are encouraged to blog about military life, said Army Public Affairs Spc. Lindy Kyzer. ""We're actually entering an era of transparency, where we need to have our soldiers talk. It does open up risks. Once you post something, you can't get it back. But we trust our soldiers with a lot,"" she said. ""They are our best spokespersons. They know what the life of a soldier is like, and it's important to convey that to the American people."" Blogging also helps soldiers process traumatic combat experiences that can be hard for them to talk about, Kyzer said. Since leaving Iraq, Buzzell collected his wartime blog posts and journal entries into ""My War,"" which was published in 2005. Excerpts from his Iraq blog also appeared in the Oscar-nominated documentary ""Operation Homecoming: Writing the Wartime Experience."" The war cost Buzzell his marriage and left him with post-traumatic stress disorder, a diagnosis that helped him avoid being redeployed to Iraq last spring. Now 32, he contributes regular features to Esquire magazine and hopes to write another book, the contents of which he's not ready to discuss. Buzzell is no fan of the Iraq conflict, although he's heartened that active-duty soldiers are still reading ""My War."" ""The book is being passed around over there, which is kind of surreal,"" he said. ""I do get e-mails from soldiers over there. Guys will say, 'Thanks for getting our story out,' or 'Things haven't really changed that much since you were here.' ""Looking back now, I don't think we had any business [in Iraq],"" said Buzzell, who wants to see President-elect Barack Obama end the war. ""Hopefully, he gets us out of Iraq in a way that's not a disaster or that gets a lot of soldiers killed.""","Army machine gunner Colby Buzzell began blogging from Iraq in 2004 .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- The grisly search for human remains from Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 entered a new phase Friday, as the largest group yet of international experts scoured the crash site in eastern Ukraine. In total, 70 Dutch and Australian experts reached the scene, many more than had made it there previously in the two weeks since the crash, in which 298 people lost their lives. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, whose monitors escorted the experts on their difficult mission, said via Twitter that ""substantial recovery efforts"" had been made. ""We are happy that we can make sure that these corpses can now be transported to the Netherlands,"" said Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg, head of the Dutch recovery mission. ""We hope that this will bring some solace for the next of kin. It is a relief for our people that they have now started their work."" Friday's visit to the site has been completed and all human remains found will be brought back, the Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice said in a statement. The Netherlands is leading the international investigation. Over the past two days, the international team has taken a different route to reach the crash site, after days of fighting between Ukraine's military and pro-Russia rebels prevented their access. High-level negotiations with both sides made it possible for the experts' convoy of vehicles to cross and recross the front lines to approach from the north, helped by a brief break in the hostilities in the area. Aalbersberg said the recovery team is now on its way to a new base in the town of Soledar, to the northwest of the rural location in eastern Ukraine where MH17 came down on July 17, strewing debris across a huge area. The mission will still have personnel in the cities of Kharkiv and Donetsk, the latter a rebel stronghold that has seen fighting this week. Second victim identified . On Thursday, when just four experts made it to the site alongside eight monitors, they marked locations where they spotted human remains, OSCE spokesman Michael Bociurkiw said. He said then that they might use cadaver dogs and aerial surveillance to search the scene when they returned Friday. ""This all goes back to time is of the essence,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper late Thursday. ""Everyone realizes that time is no longer on our side, that this investigation has to kick-start into high gear right away."" Many coffins holding remains -- collected in the first week after the disaster -- already have been flown to the Netherlands, where the Malaysia Airlines flight originated. There, in the city of Hilversum, more than 200 forensic specialists are working to identify the individual victims from the remains found. The Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice said Friday that the identity of a second victim had been confirmed. The relatives of the victim, a Dutch citizen, have been informed, as has victim's local mayor, the statement said. The painstaking and heartbreaking task of identifying every victim could take months, the Dutch authorities have warned. About two-thirds of those killed were Dutch, with Malaysians and Australians making up a large proportion of the others. As many as 80 bodies could still be lying in the fields of eastern Ukraine where the passenger jet crashed, Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told CNN on Thursday. ""But we won't know until our investigative teams are on the site and combing the crash site for remains,"" Bishop said. ""And that's the grisly and sobering task that they must undertake from now on."" Ukraine's parliament approved agreements Thursday that allow international personnel from countries that had citizens on Flight 17 to work at the crash site. Up to 700 of them can be armed. Talks on crisis held in Belarus . A one-day cease-fire declared by the Ukrainian military ended Friday morning, but Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman said it would seek to maintain a halt in hostilities on the route to the crash site. Overnight, 10 Ukrainian paratroopers were killed near Shakhtarsk, less than 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the crash area, when their convoy came under attack from pro-Russia rebel forces, according to the Facebook page of Ukraine's Counter-Terrorist Operation. Eight bodies have been evacuated so far, and the troops have been pulled out to a safer area, the Facebook post said. The militants have prevented recovery of two other bodies by constantly firing at the site, it added. Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council spokesman Andriy Lysenko said at a briefing Friday that Russia was ""actively preparing firing positions for shelling Ukrainian territory"" and has positioned 17 Grad rocket systems in its Bryansk region, about three miles from the border with Ukraine, according to Ukraine's Ukrinform news agency. Senior representatives of Ukraine, Russia and OSCE, known as the Trilateral Contact Group, held talks on the crisis Thursday in Belarus with representatives of the eastern Ukraine rebel groups. The participants ""committed to securing further safe access to international investigators to the crash site until the investigation activities on the spot are completed,"" a statement from the Trilateral Contact Group said. They also discussed the situation of hostages taken during the three-month-long conflict and agreed to the release ""of a sizable number of persons deprived of freedom,"" it said. Former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma told the news agency Interfax-Ukraine on Friday that 20 people would be freed ""in the near future."" He was also quoted as saying a promise had been made to transfer the personal belongings of those killed on Flight 17, currently still strewn across the crash area. The rebels and Trilateral Contact Group agreed to continue the talks -- held at the initiative of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko -- next week. Russian remains defiant . U.S. and Ukrainian officials have alleged that a Russian-made missile system downed the plane from rebel-held territory; Russia and the rebel fighters deny involvement. Ukrainian and Western leaders also accuse Russia of continuing to arm and support the rebels since the plane's downing, an allegation Moscow rejects. In a bid to crank up pressure on Russia to rein in the rebels, Europe and the United States imposed new sanctions this week aimed at disrupting activity in Moscow's banking, oil and arms industries. But Russia, while warning that the sanctions will harm relations and damage the European economy as much as its own, has remained defiant. Russian state news agency Itar-Tass cited Vladimir Chizhov, Russia's EU ambassador, as saying Friday that his country's banking sector ""will face certain difficulties"" but that its economy ""has sufficient resources to tackle these problems."" U.S. concerns . Obama spoke Friday with Putin and underscored ""his deep concerns about Russia's increased support for the separatists in Ukraine,"" the White House said. ""The President reinforced his preference for a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Ukraine, and the two leaders agreed to keep open their channels of communication. The President also reiterated his concerns about Russia's compliance with its obligations under the INF Treaty,"" the White House said. The Kremlin said Putin and Obama agreed on the need for an immediate end to hostilities in eastern Ukraine and the need to continue dialogue. Sanctions against Russia are counterproductive, Putin told Obama during a telephone conversation initiated by the United States on Friday, the Kremlin said in a statement. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden spoke Friday with Poroshenko. Biden announced about $8 million in new assistance to the Ukrainian State Border Guard Service. It includes ""engineering equipment for improving infrastructure along Ukraine's borders, transport and patrol vehicles, surveillance equipment to extend the visual range of border security patrols, and small boats to conduct maritime patrol and interdiction operations.""

"(CNN) -- At least one person was killed when an overpass bridge under construction collapsed in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, one of the host cities for the ongoing World Cup, firefighters said Thursday on Twitter. Two buses were also damaged in the collapse, said CNN affiliate TV Record, which cited firefighters. Images that circulated on social media showed a bus trapped by the collapsed concrete structure. Another photo showed at least one car was crushed. No further details were immediately available. The overpass traverses a major thoroughfare and is almost four miles from the 58,170-seat Estadio Mineirao where the World Cup games are being played in Belo Horizonte. The overpass was supposed to have been completed in time for the World Cup. Brazil's preparations for the World Cup have been controversial. Some critics say the spending was lavish at the expense of schools, public services and hospitals. Also, many of the country's 12 venues struggled to meet construction schedules in time for the games, and several workers died on World Cup stadium construction sites. Belo Horizonte will host Tuesday's semifinal match between the winner of the France-Germany match and the winner of the Brazil-Colombia game. The city has so far hosted five World Cup games since June 14, when Colombia beat Greece 3-0. Tuesday's game will be the last to be hosted by the city in this year's World Cup. The U.S. team did not compete there this year. Most recently, Brazil and Chile played to a 1-1 tie in Belo Horizonte on Saturday. Estadio Mineirao is one of the most historic venues in Brazilian soccer and was overhauled for the games: The pitch surface was lowered, accessibility improved, and a system installed to capture and store rainwater for reuse. The facility's official name is Estadio Governador Magalhaes Pinto, but it's commonly known as the Mineirao. The stadium is home to Atletico Mineiro and Cruzeiro, both former national champions in Brazil. Even before World Cup ball starts rolling, Rio de Janeiro's Olympics under scrutiny .

"(CNN) -- Air passengers heading for United States are to be subjected to new security checks that could see them delayed if their electronic device has a dead battery. A U.S. government official has told CNN the measures are in response to new intelligence that terror groups are trying to build new, harder-to-detect explosive devices. With stringent airport security already viewed as an inconvenience -- albeit a necessary one -- by many passengers, the new checks have been greeted with concerns over delays, disrupted schedules and the potential loss of expensive and irreplaceable devices. So how will the new measures affect travelers? Here are a few answers: . Which passengers will be affected? In theory the checks apply to all air passengers flying directly to the United States from outside of the country. Those on domestic flights within the United States will not be subjected to the same scrutiny. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is requiring airlines or security officials to perform the checks before boarding, says the measures are already in place at some international airports and will be formulated at others in coming days. The focus of the new measures is on airports in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Key aviation hubs in the UK, Netherlands, Germany and France have already confirmed they're implementing the measures. Security agencies have declined to detail whether every passenger will be subject to heightened screening, but one analyst said this is unlikely. ""I think it's going to be a more of random selection,"" aviation security consultant Jeff Price told CNN. "" I don't think everyone's going to be required to walk up there with their cellphone in their hand."" Which devices will be checked? All electronic equipment could be subject to examination, including laptops, cell phones, tablets and MP3 players. Passengers are being advised to make sure these are all charged before travel so that they can be switched on and demonstrated to be operational. The DHS says there's an increased focus on enhanced explosive trace detections, meaning the devices could also be swabbed for chemicals. Some reports have indicated that Apple and Samsung products are being specifically targeted, but the U.S. Transport Security Administration has declined to respond to questions about this. Price said it's possible that intelligence reports have picked up on specific brands. ""Typically what will occur is that someone will come up with a new type of device and they'll publicize that within their community and try to get others to do it as well,"" he said. ""They'll most likely have designed it to go in certain devices, which is probably what the intelligence has indicated, that's why they'd look at specific brands."" What happens if the battery is dead? The DHS says it doesn't dictate to individual countries how they handle electronics that do not power-up, other than to say the devices can't go on the plane. It's up to individual countries to decide what to do with the devices. Anyone with an uncharged device risks being subjected to extra scrutiny and possibly held back from boarding their flight, according to the DHS and airline officials. Those who get to the airport with a dead battery have several options. They can try to charge the device if they can find a power point (many airports now have free or paid-for charging facilities). Otherwise, if they find the dead battery in time, they can stow their device in their check-in luggage. At some airports, those with no ability to charge up their device will have the option of using a private service to deposit items for later collection or forwarding (at a cost of up to about $100). A spokeswoman for London's Heathrow Airport said final checks will be performed by airline staff at the boarding gate and it's up to airlines to decide what to do with the devices. Similar procedures are in place at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. British Airways says anyone unable to switch on their device will not be allowed to fly and will need to rebook on an alternative flight. Other airlines have declined to outline what measures they'll take. Virgin Atlantic said it won't disclose specific security details. ""Our arrangements are under constant review and can be adapted at short notice should there be a need to do so,"" the airline said in a statement. The DHS said anyone with an uncharged device may have to undergo ""additional screening,"" but didn't elaborate. Will this mean extra delays? News of the enhanced measures has provoked fears of increased lines at security checkpoints but so far this appears not to be an issue. Schiphol airport officials have pledged to ""take all possible steps to avoid additional queuing time,"" but advised passengers to check with airlines about what time they should arrive at the airport. Aviation security analyst Price said he doesn't foresee long lines at airports as a result of the measures. Are the new security measures here to stay? Officially, it's not known how long the new checks will be in place and Price speculates they could indefinitely remain a part of airport procedures. However, he speculates that the intensity of the checks is likely to wane as any perceived level of threat subsides. He said the new checks were likely linked to intelligence specifying a particular device -- as was the case when printer cartridges were restricted following an al Qaeda plot in 2010. ""I think they've got some intelligence that indicates these type of devices are going to be used for explosives and so for the time being they're going to increase the scrutiny and then I think it'll fall off. ""I don't think it will go away completely, it'll be part of a new bag of tricks."" He added that the most significant impact would be that ""people are going to learn to charge their cellphone before going to the checkpoint -- that's for sure.""","Intelligence reports suggest terror groups are working on harder-to-detect explosive devices .

"Tallahassee, Florida (CNN) -- For the past week, the mystery surrounding the killing of a nationally renowned law professor has baffled family and friends from Florida to Canada. Florida State University Professor Daniel Markel was shot in the head at his home on July 18 and died a day later at a local hospital. On Friday, a day after Markel was laid to rest in Toronto, a few new details emerged in a heavily redacted police report. The report shows Markel, 41, was shot in the garage of his home, some time between 10:45 a.m. and 11:02 a.m. The keys were inside Markel's car, with the doors unlocked. The report also states there was no sign of forced entry, which Tallahassee police spokesman David Northway tells CNN could mean Markel knew the shooter. The report does not state whether the garage door was open. Police on Wednesday released via social media a picture of a silver car they term a ""vehicle of interest."" Police on Facebook cautioned it may have been a resident, passerby or delivery driver. A neighbor told police a white or silver vehicle left the home, describing it as a Toyota Prius, or a Prius ""type"" of vehicle. Northway told CNN investigators used a nearby business' surveillance camera to capture an image of what appears to be a Prius. Police say there were no signs of a robbery and have yet to disclose a possible motive. They have been following up on more than 50 leads and offered a $3,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. In a press release Friday, Tallahassee Police Chief Michael J. DeLeo said, ""Our investigators are using all resources available to them and are continuing to explore all of the tips that we have received."" Police have been in contact with Markel's former wife, Wendi Adelson, also an FSU law professor, said her attorney, Jimmy Judkins. She is ""scared to death"" that the killer may be targeting her entire family, said Allen Grossman, a close family friend, who has known the couple for several years. The couple have two young sons. Judkins earlier this week told CNN his client has no idea why this happened. Markel began working at FSU in 2005 after receiving his bachelor's at Harvard College, a master's from the University of Cambridge and a law degree from Harvard. During his FSU tenure, the Toronto native taught several classes and wrote extensively about criminal law, including articles published in the Yale Law Review, among others. Markel also founded PrawfsBlawg, a blog focused on law and life, and his writing appeared in publications such as The New York Times, Slate, The Jerusalem Post and The Atlantic Monthly. On PrawfsBlawg, 10 fellow law professors posted about the respect they had for Markel and the mutual love he shared with his friends and family. ""His boundless energy was at the center of this community; it made it run, it gave it life. We are stunned and bereaved by his loss, and our thoughts go to his two little boys, who were precious to him, and to his family.""","Daniel Markel was found fatally wounded in his home's garage .

"(CNN) -- ""Harry Potter"" is back, albeit briefly. J.K. Rowling has posted a short story on her ""Pottermore"" site which gives a glimpse into the life of a 30-something Potter. The 1,500-word story is presented as an item in the Daily Prophet by gossip correspondent Rita Skeeter, who notes, ""About to turn 34, there are a couple of threads of silver in the famous Auror's black hair, but he continues to wear the distinctive round glasses that some might say are better suited to a style-deficient twelve-year-old."" The setting is the 2014 Quidditch World Cup, which Harry is attending with friends including Ron and Hermione. Also in attendance is Ron's sister Ginny, who is now Mrs. Potter. Skeeter informs the reader that Ron is not aging all that gracefully, and the ""famous ginger hair appears to be thinning slightly."" Harry now sports a mysterious scar on his right cheekbone. According to The Guardian, the story is part of a series of pieces written by Rowling about the 2014 Quidditch Cup for the site, which features all things ""Potter""-related. Growing up with ""Harry Potter"" It's not the first time Rowling has whetted the appetite of ""Potter"" fans since the publication of the final novel in the series, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" in 2007.

"(CNN) -- Many of us are tempted to look backward and replay the myriad mistakes President Barack Obama has made in managing the now extraordinarily obvious crisis in the Middle East. I've done it, plenty of my fellow analysts do it, and now Obama's own Democratic Party members are doing it too. But sunk costs are irrelevant; the president's mistakes are made. The better question is, what does he plan to do now? The President will take to the airwaves on Wednesday to announce to the nation his strategy to confront the growing threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, variously known as IS, ISIS and ISIL. So let's start by saying: Good. Obama has evolved from suggesting ISIS is a minor league terrorist team, to suggesting we have no strategy in place to combat this rising terrorist group. And now? Any strategy embraced by the Obama administration must begin and end with an understanding of the nature of the threat at hand. Too many have reduced the challenge to ISIS alone, failing to understand that the group is merely a more venomous outgrowth of a cancer now sweeping across the Muslim world, from South to East Asia, from Africa to the Middle East. Al Qaeda, its sworn affiliates, wannabes and groups such as ISIS are taking territory as never before. We are rightly paying attention to the brutal beheading of two Americans. But we cannot ignore the forest for the trees. First, ISIS itself now occupies a swath of territory across both Syria and Iraq, and so the notion of a military strategy that hits Iraq without Syria, helps Kurds without Sunnis, or rescues Yazidis without Muslims is mindless. To cripple ISIS, the group must be targeted in Iraq and Syria -- everywhere that it holds land. Second, we will need allies, and those allies will need support from the United States, both on the ground in the form of special operations forces and advisers, and from the air. They will need weapons, now. We can continue to parse the many faults of these groups -- the Kurds, the Iraqi armed forces, the Free Syrian Army and Sunni tribes -- and simply go and fight ourselves. We are better; we are more trustworthy; we will win. But do we want to fight, or do we wish to empower locals on the ground to fight? It seems an easy choice. Third, we need to crush the Qatari lifeline to Muslim extremists of all stripes, highlighted just last week in The New York Times. The Saudis know it and the Emiratis know it. Indeed, everyone but the United States (and perhaps those in the pay of Qatar) seems well aware that the tiny tyranny has effectively been waging war on the moderates of the Middle East for years. Like their alleged clients in ISIS and Hamas, the Qataris are small, but nastier when unopposed. It's time to oppose them, and to unite the Arab League in so doing. Fourth, we need to kill ISIS' leaders. Yes, it's true, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is the fourth leader of what was once al Qaeda in Iraq. When he dies, another will rise in his place. So what? Killing terrorist leaders is not a strategy to defeat terrorism, but it is a useful tactic to slow down momentum, reduce recruiting appeal and otherwise warn the group that it is in our sights. Throughout the Middle East, many are wondering why it is that U.S. drones target terrorist leaders from Somalia to Yemen to Pakistan, but both Iraq and Syria are no-fly zones for American terrorist-killers. Good question. Fifth, we need to remember that ISIS may not technically be part of al Qaeda, but it is part of a larger movement that encompasses al Qaeda. As the American Enterprise Institute's Katherine Zimmerman points out, if ISIS is defeated, ""al Qaeda is right on its heels and would be happy to fill in any vacancies left by ISIS in Iraq and Syria."" Finally, we must remember -- and that goes double for this President of the United States -- that a strategy to defeat ISIS and all those like it cannot be part of the usual hide-the-ball game to get bad news off the front pages and then forget about the problem. This hasn't worked well in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Ukraine or anywhere else. Any strategy will require sustained commitment and a willingness to speak to the American people about the threat more than a few times a year. These are some of the elements of a strategy to begin to ""degrade"" and ""destroy"" ISIS, as Obama has said he plans to do. But it won't just be Americans who are listening for them when Obama speaks on Wednesday. The entire world, but most particularly our enemies, will be looking to see not just strategy, but determination and commitment. Over to you, Mr. President.","President Obama is right to see ISIS as a serious threat, writes Danielle Pletka .
Any attempt to tackle ISIS must start by fully understanding the threat, she says .
We will need allies, and those allies will need support from U.S., Pletka argues .

"(CNN) -- Abu Dhabi is often cast in the shadow of the vibrant Dubai, but the state is challenging its more celebrated neighbor as a premier destination. ""Dubai has the reputation of being the glittery one,"" says travel writer Matthew Teller. ""But I didn't find that at all. I found Abu Dhabi so engaging and more diverse than people give it credit for."" Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates -- home to the UAE capital, Abu Dhabi city -- has a strong maritime past. Fishing was pivotal to the economy before the lucrative exploration of oil. But even as the region progresses the water still plays an important part in its modern culture. Last month Abu Dhabi hosted the Volvo Ocean Yacht Race, ahead of the event's third leg to Sanya, China. The six teams competing in the 39,000 nautical mile challenge across the globe may have been preoccupied by the port races held in Abu Dhabi, but for those taking in the region at their own place, there's plenty on offer. See also: Volvo Ocean Race: Conquering the 'Everest of sailing' The coastline, stretching over 700 kilometers of the emirate, is a highlight of Abu Dhabi, which takes in almost 200 islands. An ideal place to take in the stunning blue waters of the Gulf is the Corniche -- a promenade that spans Abu Dhabi's waterfront. Teller says the Corniche is the perfect people watching spot, with locals descending on the signature walkway once the sun sets and the hot day comes to end. Stroll along with locals or cycle down the promenade to the Emirates Palace. This lavish hotel cost around $3bn to build and occupies more than a kilometer of the city's sands as its own private beach. Rooms in the hotel cost $1,000 a night and it boasts 1,002 Swarovski crystal chandeliers and a gold-leaf dome larger than the one atop St. Paul's Cathedral in London. Out of the city center is the Mina Port fish market and, according to Teller, another opportunity for visitors to the area to get a glimpse of how Abu Dhabi residents live. In the early hours of the morning, the market is bustling with people buying fresh produce. ""You really get a great sense of the local feel,"" says Teller. See also: A look ahead to the Volvo Ocean Race . Despite its reputation as being a modern city hub, Teller believes Abu Dhabi has not forgotten its past. ""The city is very aware of the history of the region,"" says Teller. He says Abu Dhabi's underlying cultural roots are felt throughout and even though it does not have an old city as such, the Heritage Village gives a glimpse of the traditional culture, with reconstructions of Bedouin tents and old markets. The Cultural Foundation, in the center of Abu Dhabi, is often considered a ""must see"" for any tourist. It aims to showcase a range of arts, both of the past and present. There visitors can wander around art exhibits, watch dance or theater performances or simply gaze at the striking building they are housed in. See also: Oman puts women at forefront of Olympic ambitions . The city is hoping to become more of a cultural hotspot to attract international visitors, with local versions of world famous museums the Louvre and Guggenheim planned, however these projects have reportedly been plagued with delays. In keeping with Abu Dhabi's more traditional and more religious roots, in the meantime visitors have the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque to gaze at. The imposing mosque sprawls over a space the equivalent of five football fields and can accommodate almost 41,000 worshipers. The opulent interior includes the world's largest chandelier spanning 10 meters in diameter. To escape the capital, Teller recommends a short drive out to the desert city of Al Ain. ""The culture of the interior is quite different to that along the coast,"" he says. The city boasts the magnificant 19th century Al Jahili Fort -- one of the landmarks of UAE's heritage. The summer retreat of Sheikh Zayed the First is now open for visitors and often hosts concerts. It's another example of Abu Dhabi mixing its past heritage with its future arts. Abu Dhabi may not have the show-stopping reputation of Dubai, but locals are adamant their city offers its Gulf neighbor some tough competition.","Abu Dhabi hosted the Volvo Ocean Yacht Race last month .

"(CNN) -- California has long been a trendsetter. But on the issue of giving driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants, it fell behind other states. After what seems like forever, it is poised to become the 10th state, along with the District of Columbia, to make this concession. California is ready to jump on the driver's license bandwagon after many years of setbacks, betrayals and disappointments for advocates of the cause. Sometimes, it feels like we have been talking about doing this in the Golden State since before the automobile was invented. In fact, while more than two dozen states have debated the issue in recent years, California was one of the first states to consider giving driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants. It could have set the trend, instead of letting nine states -- and the District of Columbia -- get ahead of it. Much of the credit for that early start belongs to persistent Democratic State Sen. Gil Cedillo who has, since 1998, tried eight times to get bills passed in the legislature that would grant driving privileges to the undocumented. Over the years, Cedillo's driver's license bills have been vetoed by Republican and Democratic governors alike. As time went on, it became clear what kind of bill would be most likely to succeed -- one with some critical adjustments making clear that undocumented immigrants would be able to use the licenses only for driving and not for identification to obtain employment or board airplanes, or open bank accounts or obtain public benefits and other privileges. That was a game changer. Other states, such as Utah and North Carolina, also attached special language to driver's license bills. Often, it was something like: ""Not for Identification."" And it was stamped right on the license. Fair enough. A lot of Americans don't like the idea that undociumented immigrants could carry in their wallets a driver's license identical to theirs. This solves that problem. So then Democratic Assemblyman Luis Alejo, with Cedillo's blessing, introduced AB60 granting driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants provided the licenses have special language stamped on them stating that the ID is only good for driving and not for anything else. Last week, both houses of the California legislature approved the bill. And Gov. Jerry Brown issued a statement indicating he would sign it. About 2 million people in California are expected to qualify for driver's licenses, if the bill becomes law. While some activists on the left complain that the language on the license amount to a ""scarlet letter"" that will encourage profiling and discrimination, other advocates are more practical and realize that driver's licenses of any kind are an important step that could make life much easier for a good many people. That's why I support this bill. It will allow drivers to get auto insurance and make it less likely that they will flee the scene of an accident. It represents a fair compromise that gives undocumented immigrants what they need, without giving away the store and blurring the line between immigrants and natives. Lastly, the enthusiasm with which people are reacting to the law highlights what many of us have been saying for a while -- that, despite the nonsense you hear out of Washington, the undocumented would rather have a driver's license so they can get to work than citizenship and the right to vote. This law will also cut down on abuse by making it harder for towns and cities to confiscate vehicles at increasingly popular driver's license checkpoints. Municipalities currently make money on the towing fees, and, if the car is never picked up, on the sale of the vehicle at auction. In some places, we're talking about several hundred cars per month. It generates lots of revenue for the localities, and wreaks havoc on the lives of hard-working people who are just trying to get from point A to point B to support their families. This is happening more often in California as local budgets go into the red. Just because people complain about undocumented immigrants doesn't mean that they aren't eager to make money off them. It happens a little at a time, so the undocumented immigrants don't feel the local officials' hands in their pockets. This law could help put an end to it. Giving driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants -- with restricted use, ""scarlet letter"" and all -- is an idea whose time has finally arrived. It just took California a little longer than usual to catch up to it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","California will soon provide driver's license to illegal immigrants .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thai police are monitoring departures from a popular resort island after the battered bodies of a British man and woman were found on a beach. The deaths on the small southern island of Koh Tao are being investigated as murders. The victims were discovered early Monday partially undressed with severe injuries to their heads, and a hoe with blood on it was found near the bodies, police said. The two Britons, both in their early 20s, were last seen hanging out with friends at a bar in the early hours of Monday before leaving together, said Maj. Gen. Kiatthipong Khaosumarng, the provincial police chief. Police want to interview a number of people seen on surveillance camera footage from the bar, he said, adding that police have ruled out robbery as a motivation for the attack. Authorities believe that the culprit or culprits could still be on the island. They have circulated photos of 10 people they are looking for among local authorities, said Col. Prachum Ruangthong, the police chief of the local precinct. A team of police officers in plain clothes are keeping watch at the main pier on the island, he said. A regional police official had earlier told CNN that people had been prevented from leaving Koh Tao, but Prachum said that wasn't the case. Victims may have met recently . The deaths have shaken residents on the idyllic island, which takes up only 21 square kilometers (8 square miles) amid bright blue waters in the Gulf of Thailand. Authorities said it was the first homicide case on Koh Tao in at least eight years. The island is popular among tourists for its diving locations, white sand beaches and vibrant nightlife. Police said that interviews with friends of the victims indicated that the two Britons may have only recently met while on the nearby larger island of Koh Phangan before traveling to Koh Tao for a party excursion. The British Consul arrived in Koh Tao on Tuesday, the British Embassy in Bangkok said. ""The Embassy is urgently seeking information from the local authorities and Consular staff stand ready to provide assistance to friends and family at this tragic time,"" it said in a statement, declining to give any further details on the case. While the victims' names have been widely reported, the Embassy wouldn't tell CNN if their families have been notified yet. Thai authorities said they planned to send the victims' remains to Bangkok for forensic tests. CNN's Kocha Olarn reported from Bangkok, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","The man and woman were found dead early Monday on a beach on Koh Tao .

"(CNN) -- For many decades, unlike their counterparts in many Western countries, Chinese police did not carry guns. Even the armed police in China, charged mainly with guarding foreign embassies, government buildings and important facilities, would normally only carry unloaded guns, keeping the bullets separate. A police officer firing a gun was a rarity, because China was a safe country. Recently, however, a major shift is occurring that is significantly changing the landscape, as China faces its own ""war on terror."" With the war in Afghanistan winding down, there has been an intensification of terrorist attacks in China. Most bear the same tell-tale fingerprints. They originate from China's Xinjiang Autonomous Region, which borders Afghanistan, and are perpetuated by extremists from China's Uyghur minority, a mainly Turkic-speaking Muslim population. They aim to indiscriminately kill innocent, unarmed people in public places, demonstrating a complete disregard for human life. The deadly terror attack Thursday on Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, was the just the latest in a spate of such attacks to strike China since a jeep plowed into a crowd in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in October, killing five. This week's attack also involved vehicles -- in this case SUVs that drove into crowds at an open market as its occupants tossed out explosives, leaving at least 39 dead and 90 injured, according to Chinese state media. Other attacks have been carried out by knife-wielding mobs, such as the attack on Kunming train station in March that left 29 dead, according to state media. An attack the following month on an Urumqi train station also involved a knife-wielding mob that swarmed the station after an explosion was detonated. Three people were killed, included two suspected attackers, and 79 injured, according to state media. Days later, men with knives attacked travelers at a train station in Guangzhou, injuring six people, according to Chinese police. There have also been foiled attempts at hijacking airplanes. Faced with an intensification of such attacks, right-thinking people in China are united in unreservedly condemning these crimes against humanity. The Chinese people want peace and stability at home, and many are demanding that the government take resolute measures to combat these terrorist attacks. In response, the Chinese government has authorized the arming of police, and instructed them to shoot -- to kill, if necessary -- in combating such attacks. The government has also significantly beefed up the police presence in many cities, particularly at bus and train stations, airports, public squares, schools and other public places which tend to be the targets of such attacks. READ MORE: Q&A -- tensions in China's restive far west . The Chinese government believes the Uyghur terror groups have been strongly influenced by foreign terror groups. Chinese Uyghur Islamic extremists have previously found their way to Afghanistan, with some winding up in Guantanamo. China's concern is that such infiltration will see terrorist attacks in China intensify in coming years, in light of a likely resurgence of violence in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of American and NATO forces from the country. Faced with the potential threat of intensified terror attacks, China will need to significantly beef up law-enforcement capacities further and raise public awareness about potential attacks. China will also need to significantly increase international and regional cooperation to effectively deal with any resurgence of terrorism in Afghanistan in the coming years. In this context, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia, and other multilateral frameworks will have significant roles to play in rallying countries in this part of the world to unite in their common struggle against terrorism. Effectively combating terrorism will require an international united front. The international community will not be well served if we start to label terrorist attacks against one country as terrorism, but terrorist attacks against another country by another name. Put simply, an attack that aims to terrorize people by killing and injuring innocents indiscriminately is a terrorist attack -- and should be universally condemned and dealt with as such. Double standards and hypocrisy will only further embolden terrorists, and will leave more innocent people as victims of such crimes. No decent person -- and no religion -- should condone or justify terrorism. If the international community is united, terrorism in China or anywhere else in the world will never win. Let us unite in our common fight against terrorism and extremism in the world, and prevail.","Terror attacks in China intensify as war in Afghanistan winds down .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama has warned Russia that targeted sanctions are ""ready to go,"" as the Geneva agreement to de-escalate the crisis falters. Officials have vowed more punitive international actions targeting Russia's economy if Moscow, in their view, continues to aggravate the situation. Key Putin allies, high-profile Russian oligarchs and possibly Russian institutions and companies, will be targeted, CNN has been told. Obama, at a news conference Friday in South Korea, said he would be talking to other European leaders about sanctions against Russia as the Ukraine crisis worsens. The West has already introduced sanctions, imposing financial and visa restrictions on around 30 Russian and Ukrainian officials -- but stopping short of measures that would hit trade. However, the uncertainty has fed capital flight, prompting Standard & Poor's to cut Russia's credit rating to one notch above junk. Hours later Russia raised its interest rates to limit the damage. Ukraine hiked its bank rates on April in an attempts to protect its economy against the turmoil triggered by violent protests and Russia's military intervention in Crimea. Russia is deeply integrated in the global economy, and links with the EU are particularly strong. Here's the background to Russia's relationship with the West. How important is Russia's economy? Russia is the eight biggest economy in the world, with GDP of more than $2 trillion. Its economy -- which is heavily reliant on commodities, particularly oil and gas -- is expected to grow only slightly in 2014 to around $2.4 trillion. Hopes it would be one of the decade's powerhouse economies have faded, with its GDP growing just 1.3% last year compared to 2012, one of the sharpest slowdowns in the emerging markets. Russia boomed in the late 1990s and early 2000s as energy prices rose, then stumbled as demand for commodities contracted. But its energy supplies remain vitally important for the European Union, to which it supplies a third of its natural gas. Germany, the eurozone's biggest economy, imports around 40% of its gas from Russia. With the Ukraine crisis taking its toll, Russia's economy may not grow at all in 2014, some analysts have warned. What is Russia's economic relationship with the U.S? The economic relationship between Russia and the U.S. is unbalanced. Russia is the 20th largest trading partner for the U.S., with $27 billion worth of trade exported across the Atlantic. On the flip-side, the U.S. is Russia's fifth largest partner, with just $11 billion worth of trade. According to Russian Foundation chair David Clark, trade is a ""relatively unimportant"" component of relations. Energy links are also weakening as the U.S. looks to shale gas for its energy supplies and heads towards self-sufficiency. However, in March the U.S. State Department took its first step on sanctions, imposing a visa ban on Russian and Ukrainian officials and individuals ""responsible for, or complicit in threatening the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine."" An expansion of the sanctions has been threatened. What is Russia's economic relationship with the EU? The EU is Russia's largest trading partner, and there are deep economic links between the two. Almost half of Russia's exports -- $292 billion worth -- end up in EU countries. Russia, in turn, is the third biggest trading partner for the EU, with $169 billion in imports. The EU initially stepped more cautiously than the U.S. on sanctions. However, earlier this month, the EU said it would reinforce sanctions and target an additional four people in its sanctions. This will bring the total number of people subject to EU asset freezes to 22. Members of the G8 have also said they will not attend a planned summit in Sochi this June, instead meeting in Brussels without Russia. Meanwhile, the West has offered $16 billion in aid for Ukraine, helping the country prop up its ailing finances. The International Monetary Fund has also said Ukraine has $14 billion to $18 billion credit available if required. Why did the U.S. and EU approach Russia differently? The eurozone has only just emerged from its own crisis, and commentators say it could be wary of rapidly cutting ties with such a powerful economic partner. Its reliance on gas out of Russia would also feed caution. In contrast, the U.S. is weaning itself off Russia's energy supplies and its trade relationship is much less intertwined.

"Jerusalem (CNN)  -- Archaeologists in Israel say they have discovered the remains of a home from the time of Jesus in the heart of Nazareth. The Israeli Antiquities Authority said the find ""sheds light on the way of life at the time of Jesus"" in the Jewish settlement of Nazareth, where Christians believe Jesus grew up. The find marks the first time researchers have uncovered the remains of a home in Nazareth from that time period, the Israeli Antiquities Authority said in a statement. ""The building that we found is small and modest and it is most likely typical of the dwellings in Nazareth in that period,"" Yardenna Alexandre, excavation director for the authority, said in the statement. ""Until now a number of tombs from the time of Jesus were found in Nazareth; however, no settlement remains have been discovered that are attributed to this period."" Christians believe that Mary, the mother of Jesus, lived in Nazareth with her husband, Joseph. They believe Mary was in Nazareth when the angel Gabriel revealed that Mary would give birth to the son of God, a baby to be named Jesus. A number of burial caves that date to the early Roman period also were discovered close to the inhabited area during the excavations, the authority said. The discovery was made in the modern city of Nazareth during an excavation in advance of construction of the International Marian Center of Nazareth, which will illustrate the life of Mary. An association in Nazareth plans to conserve and display the home's remains in the center. It will be built next to the Church of the Annunciation, which stands on the spot where Catholics believe Mary once lived. The Church of the Annunciation is in the heart of Nazareth, above an older church and atop the ruins of a church from the Byzantine period. In the middle of these churches is a cave that was believed in antiquity to be the home of Jesus' family. Researchers found storage pits and cisterns in the compound of the Church of the Annunciation, many of which date to the time of Jesus, Israeli archaeologists said. In the excavation, a large, broad wall that dates to the 15th century was exposed. It was constructed on top of and used the walls of an ancient building, the statement said. This earlier building -- the one that dates to the time of Jesus -- consisted of two rooms and a courtyard in which a rock-hewn cistern collected rainwater. Few artifacts were recovered from inside the building -- mostly fragments of pottery vessels from the first and second centuries. Also, researchers found several fragments of chalk vessels, which were used by Jews in this period because such vessels were not susceptible to becoming ritually unclean, researchers said. Another hewn pit, whose entrance was apparently camouflaged, was excavated and a few pottery fragments from the early Roman period were found inside it. ""Based on other excavations that I conducted in other villages in the region, this pit was probably hewn as part of the preparations by the Jews to protect themselves during the great revolt against the Romans in [A.D.] 67,"" Alexandre said.","House is first dwelling found in Nazareth from Jesus' era, archaeologists say .

"(CNN) -- A rash of severe weather pummeled several eastern states Tuesday, killing at least five people and leaving about 300,000 people in the dark. One boy died and eight other children were injured when a storm struck a church camp near Manchester, Maryland, the Lineboro Volunteer Fire Department said. ""We had a very fast moving storm go through the area with heavy winds and rain, and the campers got caught away from their shelter,"" Don Fair of the Lineboro fire department said. He said trees fell on nine campers. One was trapped under a tree, and the others suffered minor injuries. In New York, four people died in the Syracuse area after the storm destroyed four homes, Madison County Undersheriff John Ball said. Killed were a 4-month-old baby; the baby's 35-year-old mother; a 53-year-old man; and a 70-year-old woman, Sheriff Allen Riley said Wednesday. Fierce winds there whipped torrential rain sideways. Several trees were uprooted or snapped at the trunk. Many more houses were damaged, Ball said. And many of those who were fortunate enough to have their homes intact lost power. As of early Wednesday morning, more than 207,000 customers in Pennsylvania still had no electricity, the state's major utility companies said. In New York state, more than 87,000 residents had no power early Wednesday morning, but as of 11 a.m., that number had fallen to 44,900, the governor's office said. CNN's Julie Cannold, Allie Malloy and Tina Burnside contributed to this report.","4 people died when buildings collapsed in the Syracuse, New York, area .

"(CNN) -- Marissa Mayer's appointment as Yahoo's next CEO has inspired a lot of feelings and opinions online. She's the Band-Aid on a bullet wound, a web giant's last hope, a difficult manager who'd run out of ways to move up, a feminist icon, a fresh start. One group that has dusted off its long dormant passion and put her in the ""last hope"" category is Flickr users, who are flooding Twitter with their rallying cry: ""Dear Marissa Mayer, please make Flickr awesome again."" They're expressing their opinion via the Internet's best bullhorns: a single-serving site with the URL dearmarissamayer.com and a #dearmarissamayer hashtag. The page is signed ""The Internet,"" and the hashtag has been taking off on Twitter since this morning. Flickr, the photo-sharing site, was launched in 2004 by Stewart Butterfield and Caterina Fake and bought by Yahoo in 2005. At its peak, Flickr was a vibrant and social community of photographers, ranging from the casual to professional, who had genuine affection for the site. Its boards were filled with positive and helpful comments, there were self-organized groups and avid taggers helping index all that visual content. The community even spilled into the real world with real-life meetings and photo walks. 11 interesting facts about Marissa Mayer, Yahoo's new CEO . But eventually it became mired in Yahoo's corporate culture and innovation stagnated (for the full story of the site's fall, check out Mat Honan's detailed history). Other sites picked up where it left off, including Facebook and Instagram, the stunning 500px and still young Google+. Each has done something better than Flickr, such as making images truly social or improving the design, but none has replicated all the factors that made users love Flickr. Mayer has a daunting job ahead of her trying to reinvigorate Yahoo's many products. But starting with one of the company's most beloved properties isn't bad advice. It has something most other Yahoo features are missing -- users who are rooting for it to bounce back. Flickr may never be the most profitable property for Yahoo, but fixing it up it would be a savvy move to counteract the company's current image problem. A revived Flickr would show the company is listening to users and still has the potential to make products that they want to use. Then they just have to make everything awesome again.

"San Francisco, California (CNN) -- Alcatraz Island was a chilly, unwelcoming place once reserved for infamous criminals. Not even the federal government appeared to want it after the penitentiary closed in the 1960s. Adam Fortunate Eagle remembers ""The Rock"" a little more warmly: a place where fellow Native Americans took a stand that may have helped end the U.S. policy of tribal assimilation. Forty years ago Friday, dozens of Native Americans -- mostly California college students -- boated to the largely abandoned island in San Francisco Bay, starting an unarmed occupation that lasted nearly 19 months and captured the attention of media around the world. A revolving group of Native Americans held the island from November 20, 1969, to June 10, 1971, staying in the former penitentiary buildings without running water, phone service and, for part of the time, electricity. ""We changed the whole course of history, not only for the island, but for the government and its relationship with the Indians,"" Fortunate Eagle, who helped organize the occupiers but didn't stay on the island, said during a visit there with a CNN crew. The initial group demanded control of Alcatraz so it could develop several Indian institutions, such as a center of Native American studies, a spiritual center and a museum, partly as replacements for a San Francisco Indian center that had burned down. The island was ready for the taking. The federal government, which closed Alcatraz's prison in 1963, considered the island surplus property, though there were moves to find a private buyer, said Craig Glassner, a U.S. National Park Service ranger on Alcatraz. But another motive for the occupation was the government's general treatment of Indians. The U.S. 16 years earlier had begun a policy of terminating Indian reservations and relocating the inhabitants to urban areas. ""[The Alcatraz occupiers] wanted to focus attention on broken treaties, broken promises and termination of tribal areas,"" said Professor Troy Johnson, chairman of the American Indian studies program at California State University, Long Beach, and author of several publications on the occupation. The landing party -- calling itself Indians of All Tribes -- was led by Richard Oakes, a Native American and student at what was then San Francisco State College. Many of his comrades were Native American college students he recruited, largely from the University of California, Los Angeles, Johnson said. The government warned the occupiers to leave, and for three days the U.S. Coast Guard tried to blockade the island. But humor -- and the Bay Area's counterculture climate -- would work for the trespassers. Fortunate Eagle, who said he generally remained at his Bay Area home but helped the occupiers with logistics, released a public declaration of the group's intentions. In it, he took shots at European explorers of centuries past, saying the group members claimed Alcatraz by right of discovery and that they would pay for the island with $24 worth of goods. ""The liberal people of San Francisco [and] Oakland, the Bay Area ... they loved what we were doing because we used satire and humor,"" Fortunate Eagle, now 80, recalled. The press covered the occupation, and the public began delivering supplies by boat -- ignoring the blockade, he said. The FBI intended to remove the occupiers, but the White House told it to back off and ordered an end to the blockade, Johnson said. In time, other Native Americans would join the occupation, with the high population point coming on Thanksgiving 1969, with 400 people, Fortunate Eagle said. Fortunate Eagle's daughter, Asha Nordwall, was 15 at the time. She said she remembers staying at the island on weekends, choosing for fun -- as other kids did -- to sleep in the old penitentiary's cells while adults generally slept in buildings meant for the prison's staff. ""We were just kind of happy to be a part of all these Indians coming from everywhere,"" Nordwall said. The population changed over time, with newcomers from across the country boating in and veterans departing. One of them was now-TV and film actor Benjamin Bratt, who as a child arrived with his siblings and mother, who is a Quechua native from Peru. ""Forty years later, Native people still recognize the occupation for what it was and remains: a seminal event in American history that brought the plight of American Indians to the world's attention,"" Bratt and his brother Peter said in a statement. ""It's easy to pass off the Alcatraz event as largely symbolic, but the truth is the spirit and dream of Alcatraz never died, it simply found its way to other fights,"" the Bratt brothers said. ""Native sovereignty, repatriation, environmental justice, the struggle for basic human rights -- these are the issues Native people were fighting for then, and are the same things we are fighting for today."" In January 1970, Oakes, the leader on the island, left for good after his stepdaughter fell down a stairwell to her death, Johnson wrote in an account of the occupation posted on the National Park Service Web site for Alcatraz. Oakes himself would die in a shooting unrelated to the occupation in 1972, Johnson said. In 1971, authorities decided to end the occupation by going in when the group was at its smallest. Police and federal agents removed 15 people on June 10, nearly 19 months after the occupation began, Johnson wrote in the online account. The occupiers didn't get their demands. But President Nixon ended the U.S. tribal termination policy in June 1970, while they still were on the island. This was a result of the public spotlight that the occupation put on Indian issues, Johnson and Glassner said. ""It might have happened anyway, but Alcatraz had the attention of the nation, and it led to those changes being initiated in the White House,"" Glassner said. Today the island is part of the National Park Service, hosting hundreds of thousands of people for tours each year. Fortunate Eagle, who now lives on a reservation in Nevada, said the occupation was the most significant event in Native American history since the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn: ""It brought the Indian issues to the forefront of the public awareness."" CNN's Kristopher Campa contributed to this report.","Native Americans occupied Alcatraz for 19 months, starting in November 1969 .

"(CNN) -- The beheadings of two American journalists and now a British aid worker have rightly prompted outrage around the world. Although ISIS only started to make international headlines this year, its rise has been years in the making. And it should not have taken anyone in the international community by surprise. For three years, the West did little more than pay lip service to the potential broader impact of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's brutal response to a peaceful civil revolt during the Arab Spring. His regime's war on its own people resulted in the militarization of the conflict, which in turn took on a sectarian dimension. In Iraq, meanwhile, the West ignored the message of Iraqi elections and threw its full support behind Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, despite championing democracy. Yet in office, al-Maliki pursued exclusionary policies that left a large segment of Iraqi society feeling sidelined. It was this marginalization that provided ISIS, which now calls itself the Islamic State, an opportunity to exploit the Sunni desire for fairer representation. But as much as ISIS claims to be championing Sunnis, it does not in any way represent Islam. The Quran clearly and categorically condemns forced conversion to Islam. It also accepts other religions and prophets as messengers of God, especially those of the other monotheistic religions: Judaism and Christianity. What ISIS is doing -- including its targeting of Christians and Yazidis -- therefore has nothing to do with practices through the ages, from the Levant to Andalusia. Indeed, Arab Christians have been an integral part of Arab history -- the presence of Christians in this part of the world is not an aberration, and Christianity is as part of the history of this region as Islam. Sadly, ISIS has tried to hijack Islam and is often wrongly labeled a Sunni organization. This is unfortunate as the vast majority of Sunnis are moderates who should not be tarred with the same brush as the extremist group. In fact, Sunnis have largely been the main victims of ISIS atrocities. In Syria, for example, ISIS has often trained its fire on the moderate Free Syrian Army rather than the forces of the al-Assad regime. In Iraq, meanwhile, ISIS has alienated those Sunni tribes that have rejected its extremist practices, while also fighting (predominantly Sunni) Kurdish forces. So how should the West and the countries of the Middle East respond to the growing threat that ISIS poses? The reality is that force alone will not be enough to uproot ISIS and banish the threat it poses to this region and to the rest of the world. Instead, militias such as ISIS -- typically based on rigid and outdated ideological beliefs -- require a multipronged approach. Yes, military confrontation is an important tool, as is boosting economic and social development in areas affected. But the war on ISIS can't be won unless a key reason for its emergence is not tackled: tyranny and a lack of justice. Tyranny is another face of extremism, and it therefore makes no sense to treat it as if it is a viable alternative to radical agendas. With that in mind, it is high time that world leaders not just claim to cherish democracy, freedom, justice and respect of human rights while merely condemning the acts of dictators. Empty words will do nothing to change their behavior. Instead, the West must offer genuine support for moderate, civil opposition in Syria and Iraq. The United States' increased engagement in the region, as signaled by President Barack Obama's speech last Wednesday, is welcome. And the proposed military element -- including airstrikes -- may be successful in containing the threat ISIS poses. But to truly eliminate the risk of its resurgence (or its replacement by some other extremist group), the West has to be more engaged in finding lasting solutions to fundamental problems in the region. What are these problems? Israel's occupation of Arab lands is one. Another is the vindictive government policies that have left large segments of the Iraqi population frustrated, a problem that could in part be resolved by guaranteeing a true power sharing arrangement. Finally, the Geneva process needs to be restarted with a view to forming a transitional government with a mandate for moving toward democratic rule in Syria. Unfortunately, some in the West have suggested that keeping al-Assad might even be desirable, believing he is the lesser of two evils. This is not only preposterous, but also immoral and completely ignores the Syrian conflict's role in ISIS's emergence in the first place. Indeed, my country has firsthand experience of having to confront extremism stoked by al-Assad's regime -- back in 2007, when I was Prime Minister, we discovered an extremist group called Fatah al Islam appeared to have links to Syrian intelligence. Experience has shown us that dictatorships are not a sustainable guarantor of peace for minorities. Instead, only the emergence of a democratic and modern civil state, where all individuals are treated equally, regardless of regardless of religion or ethnic grouping, can bring lasting peace and stability. And the West should see in this struggle not only a moral duty to act but also its own long-term interests. Ending the Israeli occupation through the principles of a two-state solution while backing the forces of moderation in the Arab world would undermine the appeal of extremists and pave the way for democratic states that foster stability. Diversity and pluralism in nations such as Iraq and Syria can be seen as either a challenge or as presenting an opportunity. But one thing should by now be clear to all religious and sectarian actors in the Levant: one group cannot force its lifestyle, opinions or policies onto the other groups. Democracy should not be used as an excuse to marginalize a minority. For years, Lebanon was successful in following a principle espoused by President Obama -- ""the principle of no victor and no vanquished."" He is absolutely right, and governments and others in this region should listen. But if the United States wants to see real change, then it will have to empower those moderate forces that are trying to put these fine words into action.","Former Lebanese Prime Minster Fouad Siniora says ISIS rise should not have been a surprise .

"(CNN) -- The Davis Cup is the just about the only major honor in tennis to elude Roger Federer and the Swiss maestro took another big step to righting that omission Sunday as he led his country into November's final against France. Federer secured the winning point in his singles match against Fabio Fognini to give Switzerland an unbeatable 3-1 lead over Italy in Geneva. The 17-time grand slam winner was never seriously troubled by Fognini, winning 6-2 6-3 7-6 in front of 18,000 fans in the Palexpo Arena. A run of four straight games saw him take the opening set and a single break in the second was enough to forge further ahead. Fognini had four break point chances in the third set but could not take advantage and Federer moved clear in the closing tiebreak. The 33-year-old will be playing in his first Davis Cup final and paid tribute to the fervent supporters who willed him on to victory. ""Its nice sharing your emotions with your fans and team mates,"" he told the official Davis Cup website. Swiss captain Severin Luthi also reflected on their triumph. ""For the whole of Switzerland it's great we're in the finals now. We couldn't be happier,"" he said. ""Roger didn't have that much time to get used to the court and conditions and there is a lot of pressure involved. For me he played again fantastic tennis."" Federer and Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka won their opening singles rubbers Friday but the Italians hit back the following day as Fognini and Simone Bolleli took the doubles to give themselves a glimmer of hope heading into the reverse singles. Switzerland will have to travel to France for the final on November 21-23, with the venue still to be announced. France sealed its passage Saturday when the doubles team of Richard Gasquet and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga defeated Czechs Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek in four sets to go 3-0 ahead. Sunday's reverse singles saw Jiri Vesely beat Julien Benneteau 6-4 6-3 to put the first point on the board for the Czechs before Gael Monfils beat Lukas Rosol 5-7 6-4 7-5 in the second of the ""dead"" rubbers. France is seeking a first Davis Cup triumph since 2001. Switzerland has never won the trophy, losing the 1992 final to the United States.","Switzerland to play France in Davis Cup final .

"(CNN) -- Two former Navy SEALs who were among four Americans killed last week in an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, died after rushing to the aid of their colleagues, according to sources familiar with the incident. Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods were in Benghazi as part of a security contractor force. On September 11, they were ensconced in the safety of an annex location in another part of the city when they got word that the main consulate building was under fire and the diplomats there -- with an armed force of only nine people -- were overwhelmed by the deteriorating situation. Doherty and Woods, along with other security personnel, left the secure annex and made their way to the chaotic scene, rounding up the consulate staff who were under attack and guiding them back to the second safe building. Their grim task also included recovering the body of computer expert Sean Smith, who had succumbed to smoke inhalation from a fire ignited by the attackers. The sources said diesel fuel was used to set the fire and the thick, black smoke created by the accelerant added to the confusion on the ground. U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, who had gone missing during the attack, was not among those evacuated. He was later reported dead. The State Department has not released details about how Stevens died, though numerous media reports have said the ambassador was taken from the consulate to Benghazi Medical Center by locals. After arriving back at the annex, the incident was far from over for the security team, which included Woods and Doherty. An attack was launched on the annex -- this one more intense than the initial assault on the main building. Military officials in Benghazi told CNN that rocket-propelled grenades were among the heavy firepower used by the attackers at the annex, with one official saying mortars were also fired. ""It was during that (second attack) that two additional U.S. personnel were killed and two others were wounded,"" a senior administration official said last week in providing details of the attack. Those two victims were later confirmed to be Doherty and Woods. The men were remembered last week during a transfer-of-remains ceremony attended by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama. Doherty grew up in Massachusetts with a passion for the outdoors. He served two tours of duty in Iraq, starting with the U.S. invasion in 2003, before leaving the military in 2005. He then became a private security contractor, working in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen. A diplomatic source told CNN that Doherty was in Libya to search for shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles -- a mission given high priority after the fall of longtime Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi. Woods, a registered nurse and certified paramedic, served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. After retiring from the Navy, he worked in diplomatic security in posts from Central America to the Middle East. ""Four Americans, four patriots, they loved their country and chose to serve it and serve it well,"" Obama said. ""They had a mission and they believed in it, and they knew the danger and they accepted it. They didn't simply embrace the American ideal, they lived it, they embodied it: the courage, the hope and, yes, the idealism."" CNN's Arwa Damon contributed to this report from Benghazi, Libya.","Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods were part of a security team that rushed to scene of consulate attack .

"(CNN) -- As the pounding of war drums intensifies against ISIS and its advances in Iraq and Syria, at least one senator is voicing opposition to plans to arm Syrian rebels and says he's willing to shut down the government over it. Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat who often finds himself at odds with the White House, said spending $500 million to provide weapons to groups in Syria that are fighting both ISIS and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will backfire. ""At the end of the day, most of the arms that we give to people are used against us. Most of the people we train turn against us,"" Manchin said Tuesday on CNN's ""New Day."" While lawmakers are expected to put off until after the November election a vote on direct U.S. military action in Syria, votes on arming Syrian rebels could come this week as part of a larger funding bill. The House is slated to vote Wednesday, and the Senate soon after, on a measure that ties funding for the entire government to a measure authorizing the administration to arm Syrian opposition groups. Government funding runs out at the end of September and if new legislation isn't passed, many government services will come to a halt. Manchin, who is opposed to arming the rebels, called tying the two issues together an ""atrocious"" package. ""I'm willing to vote. I will vote no -- absolutely no -- and stand tall in West Virginia to explain my vote,"" he said. Manchin said his critics might say he voted to shut down the government. His response: ""But guess what's wrapped into it, a policy that might get us embroiled (in war) for years and years."" Congressional leaders are reluctant to hold a stand-alone vote on the measure because of the upcoming midterm elections less than two months away. Lawmakers would have to go to their districts and explain their positions to a war-weary public. Manchin is not up for re-election this year. But at least one senator running for re-election has indicated opposition to arming the rebels. Sen. Mark Begich of Alaska, who is in a tight race against Republican Dan Sullivan, said in a statement last week that he opposes the plan ""at this time."" ""I am gravely concerned by reports of ISIS seizing and utilizing U.S. weapons intended for those fighting against the Syrian regime, and we must have greater assurance that we aren't arming extremists who will eventually use the weapons against us,"" Begich added. Manchin also responded to lawmakers, including Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who are suggesting that the U.S. approach to ISIS go even further than what President Barack Obama has proposed and include U.S. involvement in a ground war. ""In West Virginia, at least we know the definition of insanity -- doing the same thing over and over, expecting different results,"" he said.

"Tacloban, Philippines (CNN) -- No building in this coastal city of 200,000 residents appears to have escaped damage from Super Typhoon Haiyan. Most roads were impassable Saturday; all communications except for satellite phones were down; medical supplies, food and water were scarce; and there were reports of looting. And that was far from the worst of it. Death toll likely exceeds 1,000 . People who had walked, sometimes for hours, to the relief station at the Tacloban airport told stories of the human cost. Children torn from arms . Marvin Isanan said three of his daughters -- ages 8, 13 and 15 -- were swept from his arms by the storm surge. He and his wife, Loretta Isanan, had found the bodies of the two younger children. ""Only the eldest one is missing,"" Marvin Isanan said through tears. ""I hope she's alive."" A woman at the airport said she escaped the water by climbing onto her roof. From there, she watched bodies float by. Authorities have only estimates of the deaths. Gwendolyn Pang, secretary general of the Philippine Red Cross, estimated that 1,000 people died in Tacloban and an additional 200 on the nearby island of Samar. The airport now houses a makeshift morgue. Further inland, a CNN crew found a small chapel being used to house nine covered bodies -- five of them children. Water, wind and fire create catastrophe . The scene from the air . CNN's Ivan Watson traveled by plane from Manila to Tacloban with civil aviation officials Sunday. ""On approach, you could see entire forests of palm trees that have been flattened in the hills around Tacloban,"" he said. Watson saw flooded villages and devastated coastlines, as well as a warehouse district where every roof seemed to be missing. William Hotchkiss, director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines and a former air force commander, said, ""I'm 70 years old, and I've never seen anything like this before."" Eastern islands first to feel typhoon's force . Samar province and Tacloban, in Leyte province, are part of the Philippines' eastern islands. U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur made his famous return to the Philippines near Tacloban in World War II, wading ashore from the Leyte Gulf in 1944. The Battle of Samar was part of the ensuing naval battle in the Leyte Gulf, which ended with Japanese naval forces crushed. The geography made the area the first heavily populated area to feel the force of Haiyan on Friday. The million people who lived along the coast, many of them in rough-built shacks, may have been worst affected by what some said was a 5-foot storm surge that spread through the city of Tacloban at the height of the storm and with devastating speed. It receded quickly, leaving a path marked by pieces of people's lives destroyed. Relief effort no match for need . Interactive map of the storm . The Tacloban airport was not ready to accommodate the landing of large planes carrying aid, though military helicopters began ferrying in supplies on Saturday. Trees and debris had blocked the road to the airport, further delaying the relief operation, but authorities cleared that road Sunday. Residents lined up at the airport for food. But the resources available were proving no match for the massive needs of the people, some of whom scoured piles of garbage in the streets for food, water or even missing loved ones. U.S. offers aid, send teams to help . Some residents broke into grocery stores to find food. The government responded to reports of looting by sending in police reinforcement and a 500-member military battalion. People were wading through waist-high water amid a landscape littered with overturned vehicles, downed utility poles and trees, all of which were blocking the aid effort. With basically no medical supplies left, the city's St. Paul's hospital was hopelessly overwhelmed. The Philippine Red Cross succeeded in getting its assessment team into Tacloban but had not managed to get its main team of aid workers and equipment to the city, Chairman Richard Gordon said. ""We really are having access problems,"" he said, adding that he was considering chartering a boat, which would take at least 1Â½ days to get there. How to help . CNN's Andrew Stevens and Paula Hancocks reported this story from Tacloban; Tom Watkins and David Simpson wrote from Atlanta.","NEW: Seen from the air, forests of palm trees flattened, flooded villages .

"(CNN) -- A recent, widely discussed column in Slate rekindled an old debate about women, drinking and rape. It argued that young women should not become intoxicated because studies have shown that drinking, and the incoherence it produces, can lead to rape. Last week, in an article in USA Today law enforcement officials identified alcohol as ""the No. 1 date rape drug,"" and health care providers urged women not to conduct themselves in ways that increase the likelihood of sexual assault. The conclusion that these articles draw from studies and health professionals show just how far we have not come in understanding the inextricable link between power, violence, misogyny and rape culture. Indeed, some who have contributed to this dialogue have come perilously close to blaming the victims of rape for their own attack. In The Daily Campus, Southern Methodist University's student-run newspaper, student Kirby Wiley last week, argued that ""If the media would focus more attention on the fact that the majority of the women who are sexually assaulted are intoxicated, as opposed to stating and restating how horrible the perpetrator is, then maybe young women would start to listen."" SMU student op-ed links drinking irresponsibly with rape . Focus more attention on the drinking habits of women than on the viciousness of rapists? As Jasmine Lester -- the founder of Arizona State University's Sun Devils Against Sexual Assault, a group that aims to cut sexual violence -- recently told me, ""rapists are rapists, regardless, and it's dangerous to focus on telling potential victims what not to do rather than focusing on punishments for rapists."" Warning women about heavy drinking places the burden of not being sexually assaulted squarely on the shoulders of victims, and when they are raped this twisted dynamic often leads them to blame themselves for their own mauling. This is particularly disturbing because there is no female behavioral pattern that will thwart an assailant who is determined to harm them. The bottom line is that the victims of rape should not be expected to have forestalled their attack, and are never to blame for it, even if they are a drunken ""hot messes"" at the afterparty. My mother and other feminist mentors taught me at a young age that rape is about power, control and the more widespread problems embedded in our enduringly misogynistic society. Many men believe that women, as allegedly weaker people, should be conquered, and that rape is merely an assertion of inherent masculinist supremacy. Many men simply do not subscribe to women's historian Gerda Lerner's ""radical notion that women are,"" in fact, ""human beings."" We need to look no further for evidence of this than the Steubenville, Ohio, incident in 2012 in which a teenage girl was sexually assaulted, was dehumanized, and then blamed and vilified by some in her community and beyond, while others appeared to lament that the futures of her football-hero assailants were ruined by their rape conviction. In a similar case in Maryville, Missouri, this year, a teenage girl alleged she'd been raped, the sheriff ""described it as a 'horrible crime',"" declared that the perpetrators should be ""punished,"" and then the county attorney declined to prosecute, saying ""there was not a criminal offense."" (The charges were dropped, but after a wide outcry, the case was, thankfully, reopened.) Despite these realities and the frequency with which women are subjected to sexual violence, the dialogue of late has recalled pre-feminist movement denunciations of ""bad girls"" who invite sexual assault by wearing provocative clothes, drinking too much and losing their wits. As a father of a young daughter, I find this very disturbing. Blaming excessive drinking for sexual assault among women is like blaming someone who left their keys in their car for the theft of their vehicle. Is leaving your keys in your car unwise? Yes. Is it the cause of your car being stolen? No. The person who stole your car is the responsible one. Besides, they do not need your keys to take your car. Sadly, the certainty of punishment for stealing a car is often much greater than the certaining of punishment for raping someone; 97% of rapists receive no punishment, according to an analysis by RAINN and the Justice Department. Even if someone is being ""stupid"" and leaving his or her car unlocked, and it is stolen, few people will respond by saying ""we should not punish the car thief because who can blame him for taking advantage?"" If we want to help protect women from sexual assault, let us do so by ridding ourselves of misogyny and moving against the source of the problem, not the victim. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Matthew Whitaker.","Matthew Whitaker: Articles said women could avoid rape if they didn't drink too much .
He says it's ridiculous to focus on women's behavior and not crime of the rapist .
He says women should not be expected to prevent their rape, made to feel guilt if they didn't .
Whitaker: This discussion is retrograde. To prevent rape, fix misogyny, not women's behavior ."
"ADRE, Chad (CNN) -- Nearly 100 children at the center of an international scandal that left them stranded at an orphanage in remote eastern Chad returned home after nearly five months Friday, and were being reunited with their families. Some of the children who were nearly abducted by a French charity, pictured in Abeche in November 2007. It was a six-hour bus ride from Abeche, in eastern Chad, to Adre, on the border with Sudan, where mothers and fathers gathered at the post office waiting for their children. During the ride, the bus broke down when its radiator burst. Those accompanying the children were concerned about rebels causing trouble along the way, but that concern turned out to be unfounded. The 97 children were taken from their homes in October by a then-obscure French charity, L'Arche de Zoe (Zoe's Ark), which claimed they were orphans from Sudan's war-torn Darfur region.  Watch as children prepare for return home. » . The group, which registered under the name ""Children's Rescue"" in Chad,  planned to place the orphans with foster families in France. But Chadian authorities stopped the group just before its first planeload of children departed Abeche, after it was discovered that most of the children -- who range form age one to 10 -- were from Chad and had at least one living parent. Both Chadian and French officials were quick to criticize the group's actions. Zoe's Ark head Eric Breteau and five others were convicted of attempted kidnapping. They were initially sentenced to eight years of hard labor in Chad, but were taken to France and jailed there after French President Nicolas Sarkozy intervened by flying to Chad and appealing directly to President Idriss Deby. Although UNICEF and other agencies rapidly determined the children were Chadian, finding their parents was an arduous process, as little paperwork on them could be found. Social workers and officials literally went door-to-door in the Chad-Sudan border region, with photographs in some cases, asking parents whether the children were theirs. Those efforts were hampered by a February offensive in the capital, N'Djamena, by rebels attempting to oust Deby. Furthermore, the children could not be returned home until the criminal case involving them was complete. As the children left the orphanage for the last time on their trip home, Red Cross and UNICEF workers who have cared for them over the months were in tears. Some of the children are too young to know what is going on, but others, who understand, were only told Thursday they were going home, as officials did not want to raise false hopes. Six of the children remained in the Abeche orphanage after it was determined they were from Darfur. Their future is unclear. But the scene in Adre was one of jubilation as families headed out of the post office in a steady stream, taking their children home.  E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- It's almost mandatory that articles about Scotland open by waxing lyrical about the land of tartan, bagpipes and heather. Yes, it has all that, but let's try to get beyond golf courses and kilts, and explore what else this country has to offer. Not least is a fiery independent streak that could, depending on which way a September 18 referendum swings, see it break away from the UK to become a sovereign nation. That would mean travelers heading there might be eligible for another stamp in their passport. If they do go, here's eight things they might need to know: . 1. Scotland loves politics . Even without the independence referendum, Scotland is extremely political. So Holyrood -- the colossally expensive home of the Scottish Parliament -- is a good place to get a feel for contemporary events. The building still divides opinion (go on, ask a taxi driver what he thinks of it), but guided tours are popular with locals and tourists -- as are the weekly shouting matches, otherwise known as First Minister's Questions, that can be seen from the public gallery. Scottish Parliament building, Holyrood, Edinburgh; +44 131 348 5000 . 2. Scotland's favorite dish isn't even Scottish... Haggis, shortbread and scary pies are all well and good, but most Scots prefer to veer off the traditional menu when it comes to chow time. This shouldn't come as a surprise, particularly in multicultural Glasgow, where thousands of Asians, Italians and Eastern Europeans have settled over the past century. The South Asian subcontinent has won out with curry triumphing as the nation's favorite dish. Glasgow has several top-notch curry restaurants, including Mister Singh's in the West End which, now that it's conquered the local cuisine, is creating distinctive Scottish-Indian fusion dishes, such as haggis chasni and mince and tatties (potatoes) curry. Mister Singh's India, 149 Elderslie St., Glasgow; +44 141 221 1452 . 3. ... But its favorite drink is . Not all Scots like a drink, but whisky is perhaps Scotland's most famous export. Distilleries punctuate the islands, Highlands and even the Lowlands of Scotland, and they're all happy to provide tours and tastings -- for a fee of course. The Isle of Islay off the western coast of Scotland has no less than eight, thanks to the fertile peat bogs and pure water sources that inspired Irish monks to get brewing in the 14th century. Despite its global appeal, whisky isn't actually Scotland's favorite beverage. That title goes to Irn Bru -- a lurid soda that can cure hangovers and, apparently, destroy carpets. 4. It gave us the world's first literary superstar . Born in Edinburgh in 1771, Sir Walter Scott was the best-selling author of historical novels such as ""Ivanhoe,"" ""Rob Roy,"" ""The Heart of Midlothian"" and ""The Bride of Lammermoor."" All best sellers in Scotland and across the British Isles, they also had international reach, influencing writers in Russia and the United States. They're also credited with shaping the Scottish identity. The author's recently restored country home in the Scottish Borders, Abbotsford House, is packed full of Scott's eclectic collection of unusual objects and historical artifacts that inspired his greatest poems and novels. Scott's Abbotsford, Abbotsford, Melrose; +44 1896 752043 . 5. Its railways are amazing . Fans of Harry Potter -- created by J.K. Rowling, another literary superstar who's lived in Scotland -- will remember the scene in which a steam train transports children to Hogwarts through spectacular countryside and crosses a dramatic viaduct. This is called Glenfinnan and forms part of the West Highland Railway Line running from Fort William to Mallaig. It even slows down so that the excitable kiddies have time to take pictures. Stunning views also form the backdrop of rail crossings over the Forth and Tay bridges spanning waterways on Scotland's east coast. The rest of the rail network is still a cheap(ish) way to visit almost every corner of Scotland. ScotRail's Freedom of Scotland Travelpass gives four days' unlimited travel on trains, ferries and some bus and coach services, while the Kids Go Free ticket gives further discounts as well as free entry to a some of Scotland's best attractions. 6. It's a bridge to Scandinavia . While the chain stores on Edinburgh's Princes Street may reflect the UK's commercial grip on Scotland, its bleak, beautiful and distant islands seem to lean closer to Norway. That's likely because many were once part of the Old Norse kingdom, only becoming Scottish after centuries of Scandinavian rule. The Western Isles changed hands in the 13th century, followed by Orkney and Shetland about 200 years later, but links are still strong. Many place names and island flags hark back to their Nordic roots and there's even a direct flight between the coastal Norwegian city of Bergen and Shetland during the summer. The island of St. Kilda is a highlight. Once the westernmost point of the British Isles, this barren rock was once hope to a population with genetically large feet and prehensile toes that allowed them to clamber over its cliffs. St. Kilda was abandoned in 1930 and a ruined village now haunts its landscape. Caledonian MacBrayne Ferries; +44 (0)1475 650100 . 7. Bannockburn is still an issue . The way some Scots go on about Bannockburn, you'd think the battle there took place last year, and not in 1,314 years ago. This was the clash that saw Scotland's King Robert the Bruce lead his outnumbered army to victory against the English army of Edward II, without a drop of Irn Bru to help them. Their tactics changed the path of Scottish history, helping forge a spirit of independence whose endurance must partly be responsible for the current referendum -- it's a happy coincidence for Scottish nationalists that the vote takes place in the year of the battle's 700th anniversary. Clearly Scottish memories don't need much jogging, but there's now help from a newly opened center that invites visitors to take their place on the battlefield and come face-to-face with the opposing kings. Battle of Bannockburn, Glasgow Road, Whins Of Milton, Stirling; +44 844 493 2139 . 8. Its summer festivals are better than its summers . Shivering visitors might gripe that Scotland's summer comes and goes in the time it takes to tell a joke, but at least there's something to laugh about. That's largely thanks to the Edinburgh Festival, which every August gathers some of the world's best gagsmiths and future stars of comedy for a cavalcade of career-defining standup shows. To be pedantic, there's no such thing as the ""Edinburgh Festival,"" it's actually a series of different overlapping festivals, but most locals and visitors lump them together. The highbrow Edinburgh International Festival is the oldest, around which the lower brow Edinburgh Festival Fringe established itself. These have been joined by more recent additions including the middlebrow Edinburgh International Book Festival. Locals are famously grumpy about thousands of ""creatives"" descending upon the Scottish capital for a few weeks, but it's still the best time to experience the city.

"(CNN) -- A new version of Google Glass, the company's breakthrough entry into the world of wearable tech, is on the way. Current testers, or ""Explorers,"" in Google's parlance, will get a chance to swap out their current models for the new ones, the company said in a Google+ post. The new Google Glass hardware will work with eyeglasses or shades, and include an ear bud to replace the speaker in the current model. The bone-conduction speaker, which, similar to some hearing aids, literally sends sound waves through the skull to the ear, has been called faulty by some testers. The swap begins Friday and testers will have 60 days to decide if they want new Glass. The roughly 10,000 current testers also be able to invite up to three friends into the program, which requires testers to fork over the current $1,500 price of the glasses. ""Over the next few weeks, all Explorers will have the opportunity to invite three friends to join the program,"" the post said. ""They'll be able to buy Glass online and can have it shipped to their home, office, treehouse or igloo. We're counting on you to get Glass to the people you think will make great Explorers."" Google has not said when Glass will go on sale to the general public, though it is expected to be some time next year. Google Glass, worn like regular glasses, has a high-resolution display and lets wearers use voice commands to shoot photos or videos and access features like e-mail, text messaging, Google Maps, Google search and a handful of other apps. It's not clear what hardware changes will be made to make the new Glass work better with other eyeglasses, though some in the tech press were speculating that users will be able to insert prescription lenses into it. It's possible to wear both Glass and eyeglasses currently, though many users who have tried have called it awkward. The post didn't say how the overall design of Glass will be tweaked in the next version. Looking a little bit like something out of an '80s sci-fi movie, some have said the device looks ... well ... goofy, at least on the sometimes geekish early adopters who have been sporting them. Glass has been a groundbreaker in wearable tech, a movement that's shaping up to be the coming wave in the technology world. Samsung has weighed in with Galaxy Gear, a smartwatch that works with its Android smartphones. Google and Apple are believed to be joining the smartwatch market soon, and Pebble and Sony are just a couple of the other names that have wristwatch tech for sale.

"London (CNN) -- It may be the biggest salvage operation in history, but no one would accuse it of being the fastest. Now, two and a half years after running aground and sinking off the coast of Italy, the Costa Concordia cruise liner is almost ready to make its final voyage. If everything goes to plan, over the next couple of weeks the rotting 951-foot vessel will be re-floated and towed north from the Italian island of Giglio -- its resting place since it capsized in January 2012, killing 32 passengers and crew in the process -- to the port in Genoa to be dismantled. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's a lot of work to do before this decaying husk of a ship is back out on the open seas, and there's a lot that could go wrong in the meantime. CNN contributor Barbie Nadeau is writing a book about the Concordia, so we asked her to break down the big questions for us. What's happening now? Before the Concordia can be towed away, it first has to be re-floated. That process starts Monday, when crews will attempt to lift the 114,000-tonne ship off of the underwater platforms that it's been resting on since it was ""parbuckled,"" or rolled upright, last year. The re-floating process will take around five days. 30 huge steel hollow boxes, or sponsons, attached to either side of the Concordia are being pumped full of compressed air to give the ship buoyancy. Crews raised the ship two meters in the first six hours Monday before moving the ship off of its underwater platforms. Crews will now check it for fissures, clean it and attach the flotation devices on each side together under the bottom of the boat with giant chains and cables, creating a false bottom. Workers will then raise the decaying cruise liner one deck at a time by pumping more air into the sponsons. Each deck will take approximately six hours to raise and clean. Once they've raised the Concordia three decks above water, Italian environmental officials will inspect it for leaks. Then it's tow time. When will it be towed and how long will it take? With 60,000 tonnes of salvage gear attached to its 114,000 tonne frame, the Concordia isn't exactly a speedboat. Traveling at a maximum speed of two knots (2.3 miles per hour), it will take about five days to tow the ship to Genoa, roughly 200 miles north of Giglio. It could happen as early as July 18th, but only if the weather grants the salvage team a clear five-day forecast. It's just too risky to attempt to tow the decomposing liner through anything less than calm waters. The ship's been upright since September. What's taken so long? Weather has accounted for a number of delays. It was September 2013 (more than 18 months after it sank) by the time the stricken vessel was rotated upright, and the ideal time to tow it away had already passed for the year. The Mediterranean is at its most tranquil from mid-July to early August, so salvage crews spent the past 10 months making final preparations for this window of time. Interactive: How the ship was tipped upright . What does Greenpeace have to say about this? Greenpeace has chartered a ship to monitor the Concordia operation. The environmental group is concerned that the ship will leak a trail of toxins into the Mediterranean during its five-day voyage to Genoa, and says the fragile liner should be taken to Piombino, a much closer port that could be reached in a single day. So why is the Concordia going to Genoa? The port at Piombino may be closer, but it would need to be dredged in order to be deep enough to take the Concordia. The port wouldn't be ready until the end of September, and by then the weather conditions would make Mediterranean waters too choppy to navigate until this time next year. Costa Crociere, the firm that owns the Concordia, also runs a large part of Genoa's port. The company wants to bring what's left of their former marquee ship back to their home port, rather than having to keep tabs on it from afar. Costa also wants to recycle intact parts of the ship -- engine components, plumbing structures, anything else that's waterproof -- and use them in their other cruise liners. How long will it take to ""recycle"" the Concordia? It will take around 125 workers between 18 months and two and a half years. Once the Concordia's in Genoa, crews will construct a giant tent over the ship and none of us will ever see it again. The front and the back will be dismantled first, and any possessions that passengers left behind as they fled the sinking liner will be returned to their owners. How much is this all going to cost? Costa Crociere's Michael Tamm said the operation has already cost an eye-watering $1 billion, and will top $2 billion or more by the time it's done. That's more than three times the $612 million than it cost to build in 2004. What are the chances of the ship making it to Genoa? An optimistic 80%, according to the salvage firm. The worst case scenario was that the ship could fall apart during the first six hours, but things appear to have gone well. The next biggest risk is that it could break while it's being towed through the waters off the coast of Corsica, which is where the Mediterranean's currents are the strongest. Is this the end of the story? Not at all. Once the Concordia leaves Giglio, a company will come in to clean up the mess left by the salvage firms. Giglio's residents, meanwhile, are debating whether to turn their new underwater salvage platforms into a dive attraction, or to tear them down. Costa Crociere is also being sued by dozens of survivors of the accident, and the Costa Concordia's captain, Francesco Schettino, is on trial for manslaughter and abandoning ship.

"(CNN) -- Former U.S. Marine Dan Hottle knew he had found his dream job at Yellowstone National Park. Hottle grew up going to the national parks on family vacations, exploring parks in New Mexico, Colorado and the rest of the Southwest. After he left the U.S. Marine Corps in 2002, his combat tour in Afghanistan was still on his mind. Just walking into a convenience store created sensory overload. So he bought a backpack, filled it with camping gear and hiked national parks extending from California to the Midwest. ""Where I had just come from was so austere,"" he said. ""So the national parks were the perfect place to be by myself. It's the best thing I could do."" Hottle had worked as an enlisted public affairs specialist in the military and had run his own video production business after being discharged. Keeping his eyes open for jobs in the federal government, he noticed a job posting for a spokesman at Yellowstone that seemed too good to be true. With his wife's encouragement, he applied and got the job two weeks later. Yellowstone's military history . Hottle is one of many military veterans who have worked for the National Park Service and at Yellowstone, the nation's first national park, established in 1872. The U.S. Army administered the park for the first 32 years of its existence, and many of its first park rangers were veterans. Yellowstone's headquarters are old Army barracks dating to the early 1900s. About 300 full-time employees live there year-round. ""It's pretty rural and only packed with visitors in the summer,"" he said. ""We have seven months of winter, so you have to be really outdoorsy and love your surroundings."" It can also be brutal. ""Nature is what's driving life here,"" he said. ""We've seen the most brutal acts of nature happen in our front yard. I accept it because I know where I live, and I know what I'm seeing. ""I saw an injured bison on the road, and I know it's going to be food for a grizzly bear later this afternoon. That's hard for people to get their heads around. They think it's cruel and inhumane for some of the natural processes to occur. But they get it when we explain it to them."" Park stats: Yellowstone National Park was the fourth-most-visited national park (PDF) in 2012, with 3.4 million visitors last year. The location: Yellowstone is located on 2.2 million acres, mostly in Wyoming's northwest corner. (Just 1% is in Idaho, and 3% is in Montana.) Although Yellowstone is open year-round, just one road from Cooke City, Montana, to Mammoth Hot Springs, Wyoming, is plowed in winter. See an interactive map of Yellowstone National Park . If you go: Park admission is $25 for a private, non-commercial vehicle, $20 for a snowmobile or motorcycle and $12 for visitors ages 16 and older arriving via foot, bike, skis, etc. Passes are valid for seven days and grant admission to Grand Teton National Park. (Save your receipt for proof of payment.) Permits are required for boating, fishing, backcountry camping and weddings. For a day trip, don't miss: Canyon Village, in the center of the park. While Old Faithful Geyser is the big draw for first-time visitors to Yellowstone, it can take the whole day to enjoy and get around the geyser basin where it's located. Hottle likes to send people about 25 miles away to Canyon Village, which features the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. Formed by the Yellowstone River, the canyon is about 20 miles long with widths ranging from 1,500 to 4,000 feet and depths of 800 to 1,200 feet. It's also fairly young, estimated to be between 10,000 to 14,000 years old. ""I think it's the prettiest part of the park,"" Hottle said. ""It's got bears, elk, bison, wolves. If you're going to see any animal, you're going to see it in the middle of the park."" If you're determined to see Old Faithful, don't miss the nearby Grand Prismatic Spring. ""The vibrancy of the colors around the spring are created by natural bacteria,"" Hottle said. ""Those are quintessential colors of science and Yellowstone."" Favorite less-traveled spot: Hottle's favorite spot doesn't have a name. It's in the northeast corner of the park, just outside Lamar Valley and near Cooke City, Montana. About 55 miles from his home in Mammoth Hot Springs, Wyoming, ""it's the most rugged and mountainous part of the park,"" he said. ""It feels like you're in the Swiss Alps with rugged young mountains that pop up, getting most of the snowfall in the park and raging rivers. There aren't a lot of visitors."" His family hikes there year-round, snowshoes and skis there in the winter and has picnics there in the summer. ""It's where we see the most wildlife,"" he said. Favorite spot to view wildlife: The rangers will tell you that anytime you go off trail anywhere in the park, there's a good chance you'll spot wildlife. Still, Hottle likes his chances on the drive through Blacktail Plateau. Early in the morning or later in the evening, when he's driving the only car on the road, Hottle likes to stop at a pullout about halfway to Lamar Valley, where he can sometimes hear wolves howling. He doesn't have to hike more than one or two miles for a good chance to see a wolf pack or any of other animals that live in the park. Although the spot is well-known in the wolf watching and backcountry hiking community, he said, ""most people would drive right through it."" Most magical moment in the park: He remembers a moment with a five-point bull elk at Phantom Lake in 2011. Near Blacktail Plateau, the lake usually fills during the spring melt and dries up by July. But sometimes it can last throughout the summer. As the sun was setting, ""I sat down on a rock to look at the water, heard a snorting noise and saw a five-point bull elk swim out into the water in front of me,"" he said. ""I just saw his great big eyes and heard his breathing, swimming almost silently."" Hottle watched the elk swim to the side of the lake and climb out of the water. ""He shook himself off -- he weighed 700 pounds maybe -- and ran over the other side of the road into the trees. Before he disappeared into those trees, he looked at me. A wildlife-to-human moment."" Watch the elk swim through Phantom Lake . Funniest moment at the park: Moments after he spotted that bull elk, a tourist asked him, ""Where's the wildlife?"" Every day, people come up to him and ask him that question, and ""behind them are 30 elk"" or other wild animals, he says. ""I think that's pretty funny."" ""You can drive around for two weeks and not see a bear, and then three show up in my front yard,"" he said. ""You just get lucky."" A ranger's request: Don't try to admire the wildlife and scenery while driving. ""We have so many vehicle accidents here because (people) are trying to see the whole thing through their windshields while they're driving,"" Hottle said. ""I don't take my eyes off the cars passing me for a second, and everyone is in their cars with their heads turned sideways."" Don't stop in the middle of the road, either, although visitors often do. ""You can start your own traffic jam,"" he said. Instead, stop in pullouts and park your car to admire the spectacular natural landscape. Another request: Stay away from large animals. For three months in the summer, park rangers use orange cones to block off elk calves resting in the grass. ""Female elk with calves can take people out,"" Hottle said. Another park he likes to visit: Glacier National Park. Even though it's next door in Montana, it's a nine-hour drive for Hottle and his family to get there. ""It's just spectacular,"" he said. ""There's a wildness about Glacier that makes it even more dangerous and adventurous than Yellowstone,"" he said. ""You can step off the road and walk five minutes into the woods and be completely lost. If you step away from your car, make sure have your GPS and radio and bear spray.""

"(CNN) -- Aside from the iconic (and sadly discontinued) TV ads, the ""I'm a Mac"" vs. ""I'm a PC"" battle has never been a particularly close one, at least in terms of sheer numbers. To put it bluntly, Apple gets creamed. But a leading tech analyst has put together a graphic showing that the ratio of Windows-based computers to Macs has tightened dramatically and is closer than it has been in a decade and a half. Analyst Horace Dediu of Asymco has been following the Mac-PC war for years and recently crunched the numbers to show that, in 2011, Microsoft's PC desktops and laptops outsold Apple's Macs by a less-than 20-to-1 ratio. Which, sure, is still lopsided. But it's the lowest margin since 1996 and is roughly the same as 1985, shortly after the Mac was first released. And it's significantly tighter than in 2004, the PC's high-water mark, when it was outselling Macs by a ratio approaching 60-to-1. Factor in mobile gadgets like smartphones and tablets, where Apple has so far outshined Microsoft (though the Windows-makers hope to change that with the new Surface tablet) and you've got a playing field that, if not level, is certainly less tilted than it used to be. The shift, Dediu wrote Wednesday, began in earnest in 2004. ""Although PC volumes continued to grow, they did so more slowly and the Mac grew faster,"" he said in a blog post. ""What coincided with this was the emergence of portable computing. The MacBook became easily differentiable as a ""better"" laptop. It was not faster, did not have more storage or any key metrics being used to sell PCs. It was just better as an integrated product."" That's been the biggest shift since the mid-90s, Dediu writes, when the success of Windows '95 gave a similar boost to Microsoft. The PC advantage steadily climbed from 1995 to 2004, dipping only once in a 10-year span. When iPhones, iPads and other mobile devices are factored in, Microsoft's advantage sits at about 2-to-1, Dediu said, and the two could break even within the next two years. It's unclear how much he factored in Windows 8, Microsoft's new operating system that will run on both PCs and portable devices with the goal of marrying them together into a seamless computing experience. But Dediu says that Microsoft's evaporating lead could be bad news for the software company. ""The consequences are dire for Microsoft,"" he wrote. ""The wiping out of any platform advantage around Windows will render it vulnerable to direct competition. This is not something it had to worry about before. ""Windows will have to compete not only for users, but for developer talent, investment by enterprises and the implicit goodwill it has had for more than a decade.""","Analyst shows Mac vs. PC gap narrowing .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A German woman and two California lawyers have been charged with extortion for allegedly accusing the son of a wealthy Saudi sheikh of sexual assault and torture. Leyla Ors, 33, told Los Angeles detectives last March that Thamer Albalwi, 23, had raped and tortured her. He was arrested and charged with four counts of sexual assault based on her story and a physical exam, according to the Los Angeles district attorney. A judge dismissed those charges against Albalwi last Friday after prosecutors disclosed their extortion case against Ors.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Nightmares and a panic attack haunted Steven Robles after a great white shark attacked him at a Southern California beach Saturday, but he was out of the hospital Sunday. Robles, 40, was weak and sore a day after the attack near the Manhattan Beach pier, he told CNN. Robles said he was in a ""complete state of panic"" when he came face to face with the 7-foot shark, but ""pure instinct"" kicked in. ""I saw this shark eye to eye, staring at me as it was crunching into my chest."" He grabbed its nose and pried it away from his chest, he said. The shark, which a fire official said was a juvenile great white, immediately swam away and did not return, Robles said. The great white was apparently agitated after struggling for its life for the previous half hour before the attack on Robles. A fisherman who used chum to attract sharks to the pier had cut it loose after hooking it but failing to land it, Robles said. Marine biologist Eric Martin told CNN affiliate KABC that it likely was a ""response bite"" by the juvenile shark and ""the swimmer just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time."" ""I thought 'Oh, my God, this is it, I'm gonna die,"" Robles said. But the shark's bite was not deep, sparing Robles' ribs and organs, he said. ""It wasn't a full-size bite,"" said Capt. Tracy Lizlotte, a lifeguard for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. The scars to his psyche may be deeper. Robles, who would swim two miles from the Hermosa Beach pier to the Manhattan Beach pier each Saturday, said he is afraid to go back into the water. ""I hope I do someday, but it's off the table right now."" He spent a restless night Saturday, waking up from nightmares, he said. The aftermath of the attack was recorded on cell phone video by someone on the beach who was alerted by the screaming. CNN affiliate KTLA posted the video on its website. It shows a group of swimmers frantically trying to reach shore with the victim screaming loudly from the water and people on the pier urging him to hurry, yelling that the shark was still close by. Manhattan Beach Pier has been closed until Tuesday, police said in a news release. Experts debate beach photobomber: Shark or dolphin? There are plenty of great white sharks in the Southern California surf, but they pose no danger to beachgoers, according to Randy Hamilton, a shark expert with California's Monterey Bay Aquarium. ""I just go back to the last 50 years on how many great white sharks have actually caused a death in Southern California,"" Hamilton said in a CNN interview in December. ""I only know of one incident where someone got a nip on the foot."" The great whites around Southern California are juveniles, also known as ""young of the year."" At less than 18 months old, they only eat fish, Hamilton said. When the sharks approach adulthood, they relocate to the cooler waters near San Francisco, where they change their diets to mammals -- sea lions and seals, he said. Shark attacks are still pretty rare, but they have increased at a steady rate since 1900, ""with each decade having more attacks then the previous,"" according to statistics from the International Shark Attack File based in Gainesville, Florida. ISAF says on its website that in 2013 there were 72 unprovoked shark attacks on humans, actually the lowest number of global attacks since 2009, when 67 attacks occurred. The research organization emphasized on its website that an increasing number of shark attacks doesn't mean the rate of attacks is increasing. ISAF research shows people are spending more time in the surf, which increases the interactions between humans and sharks. One-ton shark headed to Texas coast . What devoured this great white shark?

"New York (CNN) -- A young concert-goer is seen in a video rubbing white power on his gums. He starts sweating profusely before plunging into crazed drug trip that ends with him alone under the glare flashing lights. The words ""Don't miss the moment"" appear across a black background: ""Be present. Avoid the risks."" That's the message of an anti-drug public service announcement that concert-goers at New York City's annual Electric Zoo music festival will be required to watch in order to gain entry to the event later this month. Last summer's Electric Zoo festival gained national attention when several people were sickened and two people died after overdosing on the drug MDMA, either in ecstasy pills or its ""pure"" powder or crystal form, also known as ""molly."" The popular festival was cut short as a result of the deaths. ""Our message to concertgoers is simple: The Electric Zoo experience is exceptional and worth being present for,"" Made Event founders Laura De Palma and Mike Bindra said in a joint statement. ""Molly can cause you to not only miss the moment, alienate your friends and have an overall adverse and unpleasant experience ... but can also make you sick and can even be fatal. Fans will experience how great it is to 'Come To Life' at one of our concerts from lights, sounds and crowds."" Federal authorities last month arrested an upstate New York man on drug charges in connection with the sale of molly to concert-goers -- including one who died -- at the festival on Randall's Island last August. MDMA is believed to have caused both of the deaths at the music festival, which was attended by more than 130,000 people, in late August 2013. Police identified the two victims as Jeffrey Russ, 23, and Olivia Rotondo, 20. There's something (potentially dangerous) about molly . On August 30, 2013, near the end of a concert at Electric Zoo, Russ told his friends he wasn't feeling well, according to court documents. He collapsed and suffered a seizure. When Russ arrived at Harlem Hospital Center, his heart was beating rapidly and his temperature was about 108 degrees Fahrenheit, court papers said. Russ was pronounced dead at 3:21 a.m. on August 31. The pills found on Russ contained MDMA and methylone, according to court documents. The medical examiner ruled that Russ died from ""acute intoxication by the combined effects of [MDMA] and methylone with hyperthermia."" Ticket buyers at this year's festival on Randalls Island Aug. 29-31 will be required to to watch a two-minute video about MDMA this year. ""Fans will experience how great it is to 'Come To Life' at one of our concerts from lights, sounds and crowds,"" De Palma and Bindra said in the statement. The two-minute film ""The Molly"" was created, written and produced by ""Dexter"" creator/writer James Manos, Jr., and his daughter Ellie Manos, 19. On social media, the reaction to the video has been mixed. Culture and music website Flavorwire.com tweeted: ""Electric Zoo's 'The Molly' PSA Won't Stop Drug Use at EDM Festivals -- But It's Still Better Than 'Just Say No.'"" One commenter on Electric Zoo's Facebook page said: ""You guys had the chance to provide some real information that could have actually saved lives but instead shoved some DARE drivel down everyone's throat.

"(CNN) -- It may not be fair, but it's not illegal -- not in Iowa. Melissa Nelson, a worker fired for being ""irresistible"" to her boss, spoke out Saturday about a high court decision that said her termination broke no discrimination law. ""The last couple of days have just been an emotional roller coaster. I'm trying to stay strong. It's tough,"" she told CNN's Don Lemon. ""I don't think it's fair. I don't think it's right."" Nelson spoke one day after the all-male Iowa Supreme Court ruled on her case. The high court sided with a lower court, ruling that Nelson's termination did not constitute sex discrimination under the Iowa Civil Rights Act. Iowa Supreme Court: OK to fire 'irresistible' worker . She was not fired because of her gender, the court decided, but because her boss and his wife felt Nelson was a threat to their marriage. Nelson was hired in 1999 as a dental assistant for James Knight. She stayed on at the Fort Dodge business for more than 10 years. ""The court got it absolutely right,"" said Stuart Cochrane, Knight's attorney. He said that for the Iowa Supreme Court to have acted otherwise, it would have had to ""ignore every other case we could find"" with similar facts. At first blush, he said, the result might sound bizarre. But Cochrane stressed that if all the facts of the case were known, the court's decision would seem more fair. ""He and his wife really agonized about it,"" Cochrane said about Knight. ""He didn't want to terminate her."" According to the high court's decision, Knight complained to Nelson toward the end of her employment that her clothes were tight and ""distracting."" Cochrane said Knight asked her repeatedly to dress differently. Nelson denied that what she wore was out of place, and when asked by CNN's Lemon whether she dressed appropriately at work, she said she wore scrubs. At one point, Knight told Nelson that ""if she saw his pants bulging, she would know her clothing was too revealing,"" the decision read. Read the court's decision (PDF) At another point, in response to an alleged comment Nelson made about the infrequency of her sex life, Knight responded: [T]hat's like having a Lamborghini in the garage and never driving it."" Nelson and Knight, both married with children, also exchanged text messages to each other outside of work. Neither objected to the texting. But Knight's wife, who was employed at the same dental office, found out about those messages in late 2009 and demanded he fire Nelson. In early 2010, he did just that. In the presence of a pastor, Knight told Nelson that she had become a ""detriment"" to his family and for the sakes of both their families, they should no longer work together. Knight gave Nelson one month's severance. In a subsequent conversation between Knight and Nelson's husband, Knight said Nelson had done nothing wrong and that ""she was the best dental assistant he ever had,"" the decision read. Nelson filed a lawsuit, arguing that Knight fired her because of her gender. She did not contend that he committed sexual harassment. In response, Knight argued that Nelson was fired because of the ""nature of their relationship and the perceived threat"" to his marriage, not because of her gender. In fact, he said, Knight only employs women and replaced Nelson with another female worker. A district court sided with Knight; Nelson appealed. Framing the issue for the Iowa Supreme Court, Justice Edward M. Mansfield wrote: ""The question we must answer is ... whether an employee who has not engaged in flirtatious conduct may be lawfully terminated simply because the boss views the employee as an irresistible attraction."" Answering the question, he continued: ""The issue before us is not whether a jury could find that Dr. Knight treated Nelson badly. We are asked to decide only if a genuine fact issue exists as to whether Dr. Knight engaged in unlawful gender discrimination when he fired Nelson at the request of his wife. For the reasons previously discussed, we believe this conduct did not amount to unlawful discrimination, and therefore we affirm the judgment of the district court.""

"(CNN) -- Firefighting crews made some headway Monday against a wind-whipped wildfire in the Texas Panhandle. The Double Diamond Fire in Hutchinson County is now 65% contained, up from 35% earlier in the day, according to the Texas A&M Forest Service. The blaze has burned more than 2,500 acres and destroyed 160 structures, 91 of them homes, authorities said. It prompted at least 2,100 people to flee their homes, said Troy Ducheneaux of the Forest Service. Late Monday, about 400 people were still unable to return home, said Danny Richards, emergency management coordinator for Hutchinson County. Some areas remain risky because of downed power lines, he said. Paula Lea was one of the people who fled. ""It almost looked like a tornado -- I mean, just a tornado of smoke. And it was so thick and heavy, you just couldn't breathe,"" said Lea, who spoke to CNN at a temporary shelter. She said her home survived, but her father-in-law's house did not. A cold front raised humidity and was helping firefighting efforts. Richards said authorities were still tackling hotspots. The wildfire started late Sunday afternoon and was driven by strong, shifting winds. The cause has not been determined. The State Fire Marshal has been called in to assist the investigation, Richards said. Fast-moving wildfire burns at least 20 homes in Oklahoma . What to know about wildfires .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Marine Corps reservist held in a Mexican prison for more than three months on a weapons charge could have been released within days of his detention if not for ""missed opportunities"" by his original legal counsel, his attorney told CNN. In an exclusive phone interview, Fernando Benitez -- the latest attorney for jailed Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi -- said his client's case was allowed to ""simmer"" by his original attorneys. They have since been fired. ""For anybody being involved in a criminal case in Mexico, the first 96 hours ... those first 96 hours are crucial,"" Benitez said. ""A lot can be done, and releases can and are obtained regularly, but you have to aggressively address a defensive strategy."" Now, Benitez says, his client is at the mercy of the Mexican judicial system, and there is no timetable for his release. Tahmooressi has maintained that he took a wrong turn on the California side of the border into Tijuana, Mexico, the night of March 31. His mother told CNN in May that Tahmooressi, who served in Afghanistan, had moved to the San Ysidro, California, area to get treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. He was detained by Mexican border officials for possessing a .45-caliber pistol, a 12-gauge pump shotgun and an AR-15 rifle. For weeks, Tahmooressi sat in a Tijuana prison while his defense attorneys failed to submit evidence to the court in the initial stages of his defense. Tahmooressi and his attorneys alleged that he was beaten and tortured by guards and prisoners at the prison. Mexican officials have denied that claim. He has since been transferred to El Hongo Penitentiary in Tecate, where he told CNN earlier this month that he is being treated well. Benitez has submitted evidence and will continue to do so between now and August 4, Tahmooressi's next court date. His combined legal bills have already surpassed more than $20,000, according to the family. ""In Andrew's case, several windows of opportunity were missed,"" Benitez said. ""It's frustrating to us. I would have loved to have taken advantage of those opportunities. But now we need to work with what we have and that's exactly what we're going to do."" Germane to Tahmooressi's defense is that Tahmooressi's rights were violated under the Mexican constitution, Benitez said. ""I believe he was denied several basic human rights, which, it's my contention, should result in reparation from the court"" in the form of declaring a mistrial or tossing out the testimony ""of those officers who are singling him out as the responsible party in this case."" A 20-year criminal defense veteran, Benitez said he has a strong track record of acquittals or cases being thrown out in federal court. In 2011, he defended former Tijuana Mayor Hank Rhon, whose house was raided by Mexican soldiers who discovered an arsenal of illegal guns and ammunition. Benitez successfully argued that the raid was performed without a warrant. All charges were dropped. The same should be expected for Tahmooressi's case, Benitez told CNN. ""Andrew's case, believe it or not, is technically not that complex,"" Benitez said. ""It's a mistake many people have made. I've driven my car up to San Diego and back to Tijuana and I can tell you I've made the same mistake he made. And I'm a resident. The evidence we've been uncovering all supports his story.""

"(CNN) -- While most of the country moves forward on legal protections for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender persons (LGBT), Republicans in Texas have retrenched their opposition in a shocking manner. The Texas Republican Party adopted a plank in its platform endorsing reparative therapy for gays and lesbians, even though such treatments have been rejected as harmful by all leading medical and psychological associations and even outlawed in some states. Texas Gov. Rick Perry added fuel to the fire by comparing gays and lesbians to alcoholics and refusing to step back from such insulting comments. Perry's views, however, bear further exploration. In his remarks, he used genetic predispositions to make his comparison: ""I may have the genetic coding that I'm inclined to be an alcoholic, but I have the desire not to do that -- and I look at the homosexual issue the same way."" At a very superficial level, there is a kernel of truth here. Scientific studies have demonstrated that biology plays a role in one's sexual orientation. Studies of identical twins, who share the same genes, have shown that, if one twin is gay, the other is more likely to be gay, suggesting sexual orientation is influenced by genetics. Scientists also discovered a ""fraternal birth order effect"": the more male children a woman has, the greater chance that the next one will be gay. The reason for this effect is unknown, but it suggests there may be some change in the mother's body that influences the development of the male fetus. Perhaps the greatest furor over the biological origins of sexual orientation occurred in 1993. Scientist Dean Hamer and others published a study in Science that showed a connection between a particular part of the X chromosome and male homosexuality. Although the study did not find a particular gene, it suggested that such a gene exists on the X chromosome. More recent studies have identified other potential links between homosexuality and genetics, and scientists have offered explanations on how same-sex attraction could advance procreation. Reviewing all the various studies in his 2012 book, ""Gay, Straight, and the Reason Why: The Science of Sexual Orientation,"" neuroscientist Simon LeVay concludes that, ""taken together, the multitude of research studies published since 1991 have greatly strengthened the idea that biological factors play a significant rule in the development of sexual orientationâ€”in both men and in women."" Many gay rights activists laud these studies because they support the argument that LGBT persons should be afforded legal protections because sexual orientation is an immutable trait, akin to race or gender. If it's in our genes, you can't discriminate against us. But finding the biological origins of same-sex attraction has the potential to undermine the rights of gays and lesbians. For example, could someone try to get a patent on a gene related to sexual orientation? While it is possible to patent certain genetic material, the gene must be ""useful"" to qualify for patent protection. Why would a gene related to sexual orientation be useful? Most patents on genes relate to diseases, such as breast cancer, diabetes, or, as Perry noted, alcoholism. The utility of these inventions is readily apparent â€” developing treatments for these pathological conditions. But what use is a gay gene -- to ""treat"" gays and lesbians? I believe such genetic discoveries should not be patent eligible because they are not useful. Gays and lesbians are not sick, and the medical community agrees. The exploration of why a gay gene should not be viewed as ""useful"" highlights the broader concern with these scientific studies: It becomes easier for LGBT opponents to argue that gays and lesbians are biologically flawed, akin to a disease that should be and could be cured. The 1996 movie ""Twilight of the Golds"" explores this dynamic in the context of a prenatal test that could predict the likelihood that the child would be gay, and the consequent decision of whether to end the pregnancy. In a more commercial and thinly veiled context, the 2006 movie ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" explored the potential implications of inventing and administering a ""cure"" for a stigmatized physiological condition. Even though we tend to view science as objective, it is often laden with moral considerations. The concept of a ""gay gene"" reveals this normative slant. Why is it the ""gay"" gene and not just the ""sexual orientation"" gene, or even the ""straight"" gene? Calling it the ""gay gene"" reveals the bias in favor of heterosexuality, which risks viewing gays and lesbians as biologically flawed and thus inferior. LGBT legal rights should not be contingent on biology or immutability. And, contrary to Perry's insinuation, sexual orientation is not like a disease. It is like eye color or left-handedness -- a natural and healthy variation within the population. We must take care that our rights do not hinge on biology. While it is strange to find wisdom from comic book characters, Halle Berry's character Storm in the X-Men had it right: There is nothing to cure. There is nothing wrong with us. And our rights shouldn't depend on it.","In Texas, the GOP endorses reparative therapy for gays and lesbians .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- With its orange paint, muscular look and mounted steer horns, an unusual race car has been turning heads on the streets of this capital city. But that's not even the most interesting thing about it. This is a Rally Fighter, believed to be the first production vehicle to be designed through crowdsourcing, the process of drawing input from a global community of interested people via the Internet. ""If Henry Ford had had Twitter and Internet access, he surely would have made his automobiles in a very different way,"" said John B. Rogers, president and co-founder of Local Motors, the Arizona car maker that built the Rally Fighter. The company's slogan: ""Made by you in America."" Rogers spoke at the South by Southwest Interactive festival in Austin on the use of crowdsourcing to make the best possible automobile in the cheapest and most efficient way. Local Motors claims that its Rally Fighter is the first vehicle in the world to be created following this principle. Rogers said it was produced in 18 months, about five times faster than through conventional processes. The design was chosen through a 2009 vote by a community of hundreds of people on the Internet. The winning design was submitted by Sangho Kim of Pasadena, California, and the result is a car with a 6.2-liter engine, eight cylinders, automatic transmission, rear-wheel drive and 430 horsepower. The Web community also participated in the design of several vehicle components, like the doors. Local Motors says it spent $3 million on the car's development, much less than what is spent on commercial models by the major automakers. How did it achieve that? To Rogers, it was by rethinking the vehicle's features. ""It costs $10 to design a five-point seat belt like the Rally Fighter's, compared to the $6 million it takes to develop an airbag,"" Rogers said. The price of this car is $99,900, which includes a six-day stay at Local Motors' Arizona plant -- to build the car. You see, when someone buys a Rally Fighter, they don't get an assembled car but a kit. It includes detailed instructions in the form of manuals, wikis and YouTube how-to videos -- plus the support of Local Motors' experts. Dozens of the cars have been sold, mostly in the U.S. and some in Kazakhstan, Russia and Great Britain, Rogers said. The goal is to sell 2,000 Rally Fighters before abandoning the model and starting work on a new one. Founded five years ago, Local Motors is now home to more than 25,000 community members and 50 full-time employees. Besides the Rally Fighter, the car maker is working on a prototype military vehicle -- the XC2v -- for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a research arm of the Pentagon. Local Motors has also launched challenges to communally design the best pizza delivery vehicle and the best shoe for driving, projects requested by Dominos Pizza and Reebok. Rogers said he also wants to build a crowdsourced motorcycle, a boat and a more affordable $10,000 car.","Rally Fighter is believed to be the first production vehicle to be designed through crowdsourcing .

"(CNN) -- The mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 appeared to deepen as reports emerged that passengers' cell phones continued to ring long after the flight went missing Saturday. After the torment of not knowing what has happened to their loved ones, relatives of MH370 passengers had resorted to calling their phones, and were greeted with ringtones. The aircraft disappeared unexpectedly from tracking early Saturday. No distress call from the pilots was received, and search efforts to date have not yielded any conclusive results, only adding to the uncertainty surrounding the fate of the Beijing-bound flight. Speculation quickly mounted on social media that these ""phantom calls"" amounted to evidence that the flight had not crashed, as has been widely assumed. ""Frustrated! ... There are reports from family members that phone calls to their missing loved ones have 'rung through,' indicating the phones aren't on the bottom of the ocean,"" one Facebook user surmised. However, technology industry analyst and ""E-Commerce Times"" columnist, Jeff Kagan told CNN that no conclusions can be reached concerning the ringing phones. When a cell phone rings, he told ""The Situation Room,"" it first connects with the network and attempts to locate the end-user's phone. ""If it doesn't find the phone after a few minutes, after a few rings, then typically, it disconnects and that's what's happening,"" he said. ""So, they're hearing ringing and they're assuming it's connecting to their loved ones, but it's not. It's the network sending a signal to the phone letting them know it's looking for them."" Kagan told Wolf Blitzer that the technology meant he couldn't speculate on what ringing phones in this situation could mean. ""Just because you're getting ringing, just because the signs that we see on these cell phones, that's no proof that there's any -- that's just the way the networks work."" What is a transponder?

"(CNN) -- Police in Peru say they nabbed one of the world's top scam artists on Wednesday when they arrested a securities broker whose alleged crimes earned him a spot on the FBI's most wanted list. Authorities say Eric Bartoli had been on the lam for more than a decade after bilking hundreds of investors out of millions of dollars. He faces a number of charges, the FBI says, including money laundering, securities fraud and conspiracy in connection with an alleged $65 million Ponzi scheme. His case was featured on the CNBC series ""American Greed: The Fugitives"" in an episode titled ""Main Street Double Cross,"" which detailed authorities efforts to find Bartoli. ""They track him to Kentucky, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont. They're just hopping around,"" a promo posted on the show's website says. ""And then at some point, he did disappear. Nobody could find him."" Bartoli, 59, who also has several aliases and passports from Peru and Argentina, had been at large for more than 10 years. But police in Peru tracked him down on Wednesday in what the FBI told CNN Cleveland affiliate WOIO was a joint operation between U.S. and Peruvian authorities. They escorted a tight-lipped Bartoli, wearing a track suit and a bulletproof vest, before television cameras. Authorities arrested him when he was jogging in a park south of the country's capital Wednesday morning, the state-run Andina news agency reported. ""A team of Cleveland and international FBI resources worked closely with the Peruvian authorities to locate and apprehend Eric Bartoli,"" Stephen D. Anthony, special agent in charge of the FBI's Cleveland Field Office, said in a written statement. ""We hope that the long awaited prosecution of Bartoli will provide some satisfaction to the many individuals he defrauded."" U.S. authorities have requested his extradition, Andina said. But a court in Lima had also issued an arrest warrant for him, accusing Bartoli of money laundering, Peruvian National Police Col. Oscar Llatas told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. Investigators in Peru uncovered a series of shell companies tied to Bartoli that moved massive quantities of money, Police Col. Segundo Mejia said. In Peru, Llatas told Andina, Bartoli allegedly duped victims by offering them large returns on investments in oil, telecommunications and craft companies. He started to operate in Peru in 2005, Llatas said, and intelligence reports indicate he entered the South American nation in 2010. ""Once he got money from his victims,"" Llatas said, ""he disappeared.""

"(CNN) -- It's been a World Cup filled with plenty of goals, surprise, intrigue and -- in Luis Suarez's case -- an unwelcome incisor intervention. Along with Suarez, who was handed a hefty ban by FIFA Thursday for gnawing at Giorgio Chiellini's shoulder, Cristiano Ronaldo also went home early from Brazil 2014. So too did world champions Spain, much-fancied Italy as well as England, who managed just one point from three games in a group that saw Costa Rica and Suarez's Uruguay reach the last 16. Remarkably Costa Rica topped one of the tournament's toughest groups with two impressive wins over Uruguay and Italy and a draw against England. For European observers, who perhaps don't have the chance to watch much Latin American football, this has been a World Cup that has arguably showcased the tactical innovation and passion of the Americas. ""Whereas Latin American coaches were previously laughed off as naive and old-fashioned, there's every reason to admire the developments that are happening now in places like Argentina, Chile and Colombia,"" former Monaco chief executive and technical director Tor-Kristian Karlsen, who has regularly scouted players from Latin America, told CNN. ""There's no coincidence that some of the biggest European club sides are in the hands of Latin American coaches,"" added Karlsen, referring to Manchester City's Chilean manager Manuel Pellegrini, Atletico Madrid's Diego Simeone and fellow Argentines Marcelo Bielsa, who has just taken charge at Marseille, and Mauricio Pochettino, recently appointed by Tottenham Hotspur . ""I particularly find the work Jorge Sampaoli -- and Bielsa previously -- have done with Chile highly impressive."" Both Sampaoli and Bielsa have built Chile's game around that nation's cultural and sporting genetic heritage. ""It's clear that they have created a playing style around the physical makeup and attributes of the Chileans,"" said Karlsen. ""Players from Chile were always recognized for their stamina, running capacity, combative spirit and fierce temper. ""In Sampaoli's and Bielsa'a fast, high-pressing game, they take advantage of those characteristics to the very maximum. That's ingenious thinking."" For the likes of Sampaoli and Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez, nothing is left to chance, with both coaches analyzing their own teams and the opposition with the software package Kizanaro. While Sampaoli, Mexico coach Miguel Herrera and Colombia's Argentine manager Jose Pekerman have extracted the very maximum from their players, that hasn't been the case with England and Russia, coached by veterans Roy Hodgson and Fabio Capello. ""Maybe the conservative 'safe pair of hands' approach of European sides like England, Russia and Spain is becoming out of date,"" argues Karlsen. ""It's like they are still subscribing to the idea that a national team manager is all about man-management and that the opportunity to create clear technical and tactical concepts -- especially in terms of the attacking side of the game -- is minimal due to the lack of time spent with the players. ""But managers like Germany's Joachim Low and Sampaoli prove that a national team job is as suitable as a club job for sophisticated technical concepts. ""I also think that in Western Europe we tend to overvalue the idea of a manager's personality, reputation and profile, at the expense of his ideas and ability to invent tactical schemes and concepts."" Having come into this tournament having won three major tournaments in a row — Euro 2008 and 2012 as well as the 2010 World Cup -- Spain found themselves out after the first two games following a 5-1 humiliation at the hands of the Netherlands and then a 2-0 defeat by Chile. Karlsen believes this tournament has highlighted the need for national football federations, as well as managers, to continually evolve if they want to stay ahead. ""I'm quite confident that the poor performances from certain European nations will put a lot more pressure on their incumbent managers to come up with clear and unique ideas as to how their sides can be improved,"" he says. ""Supposedly being good at man-management and defensive organisation simply doesn't suffice any more. The smaller non-European nations are catching up tactically, leaving no room for complacency."" Low wins special praise from Karlsen for Germany's rigorous preparation for this World Cup campaign, preparation rewarded as ""Die Mannschaft"" topped another tough group. ""I know that the Germans have been particularly meticulous in their preparations for the tournament, for example by rehearsing match-day routines on the day of certain training sessions,"" he says. ""Germany have an amazing team working around the clock during -- and leading up to — the tournament to ensure that every little detail is catered for. ""Maybe this is where some of the other nations fail. In football, organization around the team is extremely important and can make a great deal of difference."" Ahead of the World Cup there had been talk of how the weather might affect the European teams, one of the arguments often advanced as to why a European side has never won a World Cup in Central or South America or the U.S. ""I don't really believe that the European teams have been that much affected by the climatic conditions,"" says Karlsen. ""Germany, USA, France or Switzerland are no more used to the conditions in Brazil than Mediterranean sides such as Spain, Portugal and Italy. ""Besides, Germany and USA have done well playing in particularly difficult climatic conditions. ""Organization around the team, such as carelessly picking hotels, training sites and understanding every players' need is the key to success -- and having competent people to take care of these issues is paramount. ""The name of the continent where the tournament is held doesn't really matter that much if you are well prepared."" Weather aside, this World Cup has also demonstrated that Latin American players might just care more about international football. ""The Latin American teams seem to have a stronger identity and the players seem to show an overwhelming sense of pride when wearing the national team colors,"" said Karlsen. ""Maybe, for a variety of reason, this is isn't quite as strongly felt among Western European players these days. ""It's a generalization, but if one European player ends up giving 98% during the World Cup and a South American offers 100% that can make a difference on the pitch."" Four players have particularly impressed Karlsen in the group stages. ""I would say the Colombian James Rodriguez for showing on the world stage that he's possibly the best playmaker in the world at present,"" he says. ""Neymar is performing magnificently, with all the pressure he's carrying the nation on his shoulders. Without his creativity and flair, Brazil would look nothing more than average. ""I've also been extremely impressed with the Uruguayan center-back, Jose Gimenez. At only 19 he's settled so well into the void left by the out-of-form Diego Lugano. ""It's amazing, given that Gimenez has just played one single league appearance for Atletico Madrid. ""Alexis Sanchez is also having a great tournament for Chile.""","South American teams Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay and Argentina qualify for last 16 .

"(CNN) -- Get used to hearing the name Georgina Haig. Up until now, the actress has been best known for her work on the sci-fi TV series ""Fringe,"" but all that is about to change. Haig, 28, has been cast as Queen Elsa on ABC's ""Once Upon a Time"" series. The show features fairy-tale characters living in a small town in Maine. Disney is the parent company of ABC, and with the mega-success of its animated film ""Frozen,"" there was little doubt that some of those characters would eventually be incorporated into the ABC series. It was recently announced that ""Greek"" actor Scott Michael Foster had been cast to play the role of Kristoff, the rugged mountain man who befriends Queen Elsa's younger sister, Anna, who'll be played by newcomer Elizabeth Lail. But fans were still eagerly waiting to learn who would play the role of Queen Elsa of Arendelle, a part that's voiced by Idina Menzel in the animated film. The arrival of the character was revealed during the show's May finale. Haig is an Australian actress who appeared in the critically acclaimed series ""Underbelly"" in her native country. On the U.S. TV series ""Fringe,"" she played Henrietta (Etta) Bishop, the daughter of two of the show's main characters and an active member of the Resistance. The actress is also appearing in the new CBS drama series ""Reckless,"" which premiered in June.

"(CNN) -- In the spinoff ""Bachelor in Paradise,"" ABC has rounded up past ""Bachelor"" and ""Bachelorette"" contestants to give them a second chance at finding love. (Or is that fame? Perhaps a lucky few will find both.) With its premiere on Monday night, ""Bachelor in Paradise"" has established itself as a decent supplement for those craving the real ""Bachelor"" deal. Instead of having a gang of suitors compete for the affection of a single person, ""Bachelor in Paradise"" has everyone date each other. Host Chris Harrison told TVGuide that it's the original concept ""times 10, which leads to love triangles, drama and amazing dates."" We'll let viewers decide how ""amazing"" the dates are, but Harrison did get one thing right: Monday's premiere episode wasn't short on drama or tears. The series kicked off the search for ""love"" with eight women and six men at ""Bachelor in Paradise's"" beach house. Each week, new men and women arrive on the set to keep the stakes high. The first group of 14 spent the hour pairing off -- usually in the ocean -- and the escalating tension led to at least one breakdown in front of a raccoon. By the end of the episode, two women went home, although one of them decided to flee the Mexican retreat by choice. Former ""Bachelor"" contestant Nikki Ferrell -- the one now dating Juan Pablo Galavis -- may have called the series a ""train wreck,"" but for a lot of viewers, that's half the fun. Watchers at E! and Hollywood Life have deemed ""Bachelor in Paradise"" worth your time, and Monday's episode earned modest ratings, with 5 million tuning in.

"(CNN) -- A near all-black Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner has been delivered to launch customer Air New Zealand, giving Boeing fans and aviation nerds a dramatic introduction to this latest model of the fuel-efficient plane. The head-turning aircraft, sporting a special edition, mostly black livery, was handed over to the carrier in Everett, Washington, with around 1,000 Boeing employees and Air New Zealand executives attending. ""It's a big night for us all, seeing the plane come out of the hangar here,"" said Air New Zealand captain David Morgan. ""I'm very excited to be able to get my hands on this aircraft and proudly fly it back to New Zealand."" Newer = bigger . The 787-9 is 20 feet longer than its predecessor, the 787-8, and can hold 40 more passengers. It also has a greater range of 8,000-8,500 nautical miles, compared to the 787-8's range of 7,650-8,200. ""Obviously with their geography they're the perfect airline to really exercise this airplane -- they'll really be able to use the amazing performance that the 787-9 has,"" said Boeing's Mark Jenks, vice president, 787 Airplane Development. The manufacturer said it was on track to deliver 10 of the new planes to Air New Zealand by mid-year. Twenty-six customers have ordered 409 787-9s to date, accounting for 40% of all 787 orders.

"(CNN) -- Renowned radio personality Casey Kasem is in critical condition at a hospital in western Washington, a spokesman for St. Anthony Hospital told CNN in a written statement Thursday. ""Mr. Kasem is alert and appears comfortable at this time,"" Scott Thompson, a spokesman for the facility in Gig Harbor added. The 82-year-old former host of ""American Top 40"" and ""Casey's Top 40"" is receiving antibiotics through IVs, blood pressure support medicine and care for his bed sores, Thompson said. Kasem was admitted to the hospital Sunday after one of his daughters and an ambulance crew retrieved him from a home where he and his wife were staying with friends. ""Any further updates on Mr. Kasem's condition will be at the discretion and approval of his children,"" Thompson said. Danny Deraney, a representative of daughter Kerri Kasem, told CNN that members of the family, including Casey Kasem's brother, were flying to Washington. When asked if they feared Casey Kasem might die, Deraney said it could be his last moments or he could get better. Deraney clarified that he never meant that Kasem's health was failing as was reported by several media outlets. On Thursday, a message appeared on the Twitter account of Deraney PR, saying that Kasem was in ""stable condition."" A patient can be listed as both critical and stable, if his condition is poor but not deteriorating further. The radio icon has been at the center of a family feud between Jean Kasem, his wife of 34 years, and his three children from his first marriage. Kerri Kasem; her sister, Julie; and their brother, Mike Kasem, have contended since last year that Jean Kasem has prevented the three siblings from visiting their father. Kasem has Lewy body disease, the most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer's, and has been bed-ridden for some time. He had been at a facility in Santa Monica, California, before Jean Kasem took him to Washington state after his daughter Kerri Kasem won temporary conservatorship over her father's care. Last week, a Washington court granted Kerri Kasem the right to visit her father one hour a day and to have him examined by a doctor. On Friday afternoon, a Kitsap County judge will continue the hearing and get an update on the situation, Deraney said. Deraney expected the judge to rule on whether Jean Kasem would have to let Kerri Kasem have more input on where her father lives and who cares for him. Casey Kasem, who was also the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon ""Scooby-Doo"" and an announcer for NBC, retired in 2009. Kasem's daughter wins additional powers in court .

"(CNN) -- The third installment of our Going Green series looks at cutting-edge ideas from around the globe. Once again, Philippe Cousteau brings his expertise to CNN reporting on sea turtle conservation on the east coast of the United States. The declining population can be traced in part to man-made problems like the fishing industry and pollution. However, a major problem is the destruction of sea turtle nesting grounds by development and coastal erosion. New study maps sea turtle danger zones . Cousteau takes a helicopter ride above the coast of South Carolina to view the turtles' declining habitat from the sky before getting an up-close view of their most protected nesting grounds.

"(CNN) -- Here's an unusual site. A developer in the South African city of Johannesburg has transformed an old grain silo into trendy residences, re-purposing the entire ten-story building and topping it with disused shipping containers to provide extra living space. The result may look like a giant Jenga puzzle, but the Mill Junction project aims to provide affordable accommodation to just under 400 students. See also: Paris metro stations given exciting second life . South African universities have high dropout rates, according to figures from the country's Council on Higher Education, with many students forced to quit their studies before graduating. According to Citiq, the company behind the project, Mill Junction will help students from poorer backgrounds by offering them budget living space close to school campuses. The building has been fitted with communal kitchens, study areas, free WiFi and a rooftop social area. ""Our intention with these projects is to provide people with decent accommodation at affordable prices that is well located centrally in the city,"" Citiq CEO, Paul Lapham, told CNN. ""I am really excited about how these kind of projects can help address the dire shortage of good student accommodation in South Africa,"" he added. As well as providing an important social function, Lapham believes the project has helped maintain the architectural heritage of Johannesburg. The distinctive grain silos had lain dormant since the late 1980s but provide a striking visual reminder of the old industries once housed in the city. Adding shipping containers, meanwhile, has put an extra five levels on the original structure (including the rooftop space) and makes creative second use of materials that would otherwise lie idle. See also: Could micro-homes offer big housing solution .

"(CNN) -- The tension of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict could be felt on CNN on Saturday morning when a prominent Palestinian-Canadian human rights attorney refused to appear on screen with a representative of the Israeli government. On CNN's ""New Day Saturday,"" Diana Buttu -- a former legal adviser to the Palestinian Liberation Organization -- said she would not go on television at the same time as ""an Israeli government spokesperson who defends the indefensible."" The two would have appeared on a split screen. Buttu was speaking from Nazareth, while Mark Regev -- the Israeli spokesman -- was in Jerusalem. ""This isn't just a question of talking and sitting down in the same room but the fact that Israel has denied the freedom to millions of Palestinians for decades now,"" Buttu said. While it's not uncommon for advocates in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to refuse to appear beside people with opposing viewpoints, these situations highlight the increasingly intractable nature of the conflict. Violence has sharply increased in the region since three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped last month in the West Bank and found dead this week. Two days later, a Palestinian teen was taken in Jerusalem and found dead; an autopsy revealed he was burned alive and hit with a blunt object to the head. Buttu was highly critical of Israel's airstrikes in response to the West Bank kidnappings, but did condemn Palestinians who are calling for a third intifada, or uprising. ""What every (Israeli) government spokesperson has been doing has been defending the collective punishment that they've meted out on thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank,"" Buttu said. Regev, who spoke after Buttu, said communication between the two sides is a necessary part of the peace process. ""I think the only way we can overcome the problems is by dialogue, by talking -- by Israelis and Palestinians engaging,"" Regev said. ""I know there's an extremist element on the Palestinian side that refuses to that."" Regev also criticized the recently formed unity government between Fatah, which governs the West Bank, and Hamas, which controls Gaza and is labeled a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union. ""We're ready for peace, we're ready for dialogue,"" Regev said. ""What is the problem? On the Palestinian side there's a tolerance for this extremism.""

"(CNN) -- More than 4,000 pounds of rib-eye and other fresh beef products have been recalled because they could contain contaminated materials linked to mad cow disease. The meat in question was processed at Fruitland American Meat in Jackson, Missouri, and distributed to a Whole Foods distribution center in Connecticut, which services its New England stores, and a restaurant in New York City and another one in Kansas City, Missouri. The beef was produced and packaged between September 2013 and April 2014. The inspectors found no indication any of the animals slaughtered showed signs of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the formal name of mad cow disease. In a statement issued by the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, a spokesperson said: ""All of these animals received full inspection, both before and after slaughter, by FSIS personnel and showed no abnormal signs or symptoms associated with BSE. ""Out of an abundance of caution, FSIS issued a Class II recall (a remote risk) for product that does not have paperwork showing that nerve tissue was removed. FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products."" The USDA requires brain and spinal tissue be removed from meat products from cattle 3 years and older because it can carry the protein that causes mad cow disease. People who consume meat tainted with mad cow disease could develop a rare, fatal disease in humans called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.

"(Travel + Leisure) -- Try finding a hotel mystery shopper willing to dish on one of their stays. Ask them to reveal the dirt on the unkempt suite, the coquette of a concierge, or the wilted flower that sullied the room service tray. You can't. According to the Mystery Shopping Providers Association (MSPA) there are some 30,000 of them in the U.S., hired by luxury hotel brands to check-in anonymously and judge mercilessly. But like a CIA agent or the rare hair stylist who'll keep your secrets, gossip is not in the mystery shopper's after-hours repertoire. Even if they don't name names, everything they unearth is strictly confidential. Perhaps it's to be expected in an industry where everyone, from the booking agent to the bellhop, is famously discreet. If loose lips sink ships, a too-revealing mystery shopper could certainly submerge an hotelier or two. Thankfully, Stephanie Perrone Goldstein, vice president of sales & marketing for the New York-based Coyle Hospitality (whose clients include Starwood Hotels and Resorts and Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group), produced a nine-year veteran willing to answer a few questions. Travel + Leisure: Best hotels in New York City . The catch: we would speak by phone, with Goldstein playing watchdog, and the mystery shopper would remain nameless and description-less -- more incognito than Brangelina on holiday. Even by phone, the woman radiated confidence. She'd completed over 500 mystery shops in luxury hotels on four continents, and her voice came through the wires sternly, as if she'd been in upper management a day too long. She works as an independent contractor (paid by the job). What she looks for at each hotel varies from client to client -- some brands maintain a checklist of ten things to look for upon arrival, others more than 80. ""I pack a measuring tape, because a few hotels want me to get down to the nitty-gritty,"" she says. ""Is the radius of light emitted from the lamp exact? Is the paint on the walls in a particular palette?"" 5 Tour de France alternatives . Occasionally, she'll check in as the most obnoxious breed of hotel guest: the road-weary whiner. ""I'll call the front desk and say the room smells like smoke even when it doesn't, just to see how they'll respond,"" she says. Fake-outs are staged and executed thoroughly; she'll go as far as to empty the batteries from the remote and grumble about the fritzy T.V., or unhook the chain from the toilet to time how long it takes the staff to fix it. It's an exacting art. After she checks out, her report is written up, fact-checked by Coyle, and delivered back to the client in a matter of weeks. Travel + Leisure It List: The best new hotels 2012 . ""My goal, honestly, is to get hotels to provide the highest possible level of service,"" she says. ""When I return to these properties personally -- and I do, if they're great -- I get such satisfaction seeing that."" In the era of Yelp and TripAdvisor, when travelers can report anything at all to the Googling masses, trustworthy accounts are more important than ever to hoteliers. Coyle isn't alone in providing unbiased evaluations to luxury brands that clamor for it. 27 must-sees on earth . Zachary Conen, senior vice president of sales and marketing at LRA Worldwide, a mystery shopping firm based in Pennsylvania, says they maintain a stable of 120 full time consultants who travel 42 weeks out of the year. They too are tight-lipped, but happy to tell you their standards, which alter depending on the client. Is there a seasonally appropriate fruit at the front desk? Did you get a call from the concierge within thirty minutes of check-in? Are the amenities Gilchrist & Soames and perfectly arranged? Competition for the positions is fierce: you're required to have three years of management experience in the hospitality industry, excellent written and interpersonal skills, and a credit line of up to $7,500 -- presumably for booking your travel, which is reimbursed in its entirety. Once you're hired, there are other hurdles (namely, weeks of training at LRA University, learning the intricacies of each luxury brand.) The coursework is hush hush, of course, but it may be among the cushiest of educational experiences on the planet. One can picture these people lazing about in hotel robes, fawning over thread count quantities and proper lobby manner with equal zeal. Travel + Leisure: America's best cities for singles . The concept of sending in a ringer to report back is nothing new. Mystery shopping began in the 1930s with three men touring the country, staking out Woolworth's and Kresge's (now Kmart) department stores. It gained traction during the civil rights era, when the government hired black and white ""customers"" to investigate the compliance, and the prolific lack thereof, to desegregation laws in restaurants and corner stores alike. Today it's a $1.5 billion-a-year production, a large chunk of which is travel-based. ""In the late 1980s, Hilton was among the first luxury hotel brands to utilize the service,"" says Mike Bare, co-owner and president of Bare International and one of the original founders of the MSPA. Three decades later, it's common practice among hotel brands around the world. (Proof: LRA recently opened a satellite office in busy Singapore.) And soon enough, its taciturn nature may be over. ""You'll see the secretive side of mystery shopping change; it's becoming a vestige of the past,"" says Jeff Gurtman, a former executive at both Coyle and LRA and now vice president of brand strategy for Dana Communications, a hospitality marketing agency. The wealth of online reviews has reignited the idea that the customer's feedback is not only important, but critical to success. Starwood recently announced that it's allowing guest commentary, both good and bad, on its own websites; and more and more guests are leaving feedback directly on Facebook. ""Hoteliers read online reviews thoroughly,"" Gurtman says. ""If they notice a trend there that speaks to a problem, they have mystery shoppers to go in and test it with surgical precision."" Essentially, they're hiring people to complain so you never have to. And in the thoughtfulness-driven economy of high-end hotels, that might be the most considerate act of all. Planning a getaway?

"(CNN) -- A woman climbed a barbed wire fence at Halifax Stanfield International Airport in Nova Scotia, Canada, on Sunday with the intention to stop the plane she thought was carrying her husband, said a Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesman. ""Her intent was to stop the aircraft from taking off,"" said Sgt. Al LeBlanc. ""She jumped the security fence, but she was nowhere near the aircrafts. The airport staff and the Mounted Police responded right away and apprehended her."" The woman climbed over a 10-foot security fence with angled barb wire around 8:30 a.m. local time, according to Peter Spurway, the airport's communications vice president. ""She was immediately spotted by the aircraft control tower. One of our folks was on the area and apprehended her. She was in the airfield for 10 minutes. We had a small aircraft in the area and the traffic control tower rerouted the aircraft,"" said Spurway. Spurway said the woman then told police that she believed her husband was on an aircraft, and she was trying to stop him. ""This is a very unusual type of incident. I had never heard of such an incident before in my many years as an officer,"" said LeBlanc. Police took the woman to the hospital for a medical assessment. According to LeBlanc, she suffered minor injuries from scaling the fence. The 37-year-old woman is a resident of the Fall River, a small suburban community southwest of the airport. LeBlanc said her husband was not a passenger on any plane and criminal charges are unlikely. The airport is conducting a full review of their security measures, according to Spurway.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A North Georgia chapter of the Ku Klux Klan has applied to ""adopt"" a stretch of highway in Union County, Georgia, according to paperwork obtained by CNN on Monday. The application, which would allow the white supremacy group to receive state recognition for cleaning up a one-mile portion of a highway, was filed by the International Keystone Knights of the KKK on May 21. If the Georgia Department of Transportation accepts the application, the KKK would be responsible for cleaning litter on a part of Georgia State Route 515 in the Appalachian Mountains near the North Carolina border. ""All we want to do is adopt a highway,"" said April Chambers, the chapter's secretary. ""We're not doing it for publicity. We're doing it to keep the mountains beautiful. People throwing trash out on the side of the road ... that ain't right."" Jill Goldberg, a Georgia DOT spokeswoman, confirmed the application but said, ""the department is deferring comment beyond that, however, until a resolution is determined."" Reader feels dirty for agreeing with KKK . DOT officials will discuss the matter Monday with representatives from the state attorney general's office, she said. Chambers told CNN she didn't know anything about that meeting but said the group is supposed to meet with the DOT at some point. State Rep. Tyrone Brooks, D-Atlanta, has been working against the group's adoption application, she said. ""We're not racists,"" Chambers said Monday. ""We just want to be with white people. If that's a crime, then I don't know. It's all right to be black and Latino and proud, but you can't be white and proud. I don't understand it."" A similar request in Missouri set off a legal battle that stretched for years and went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. A Ku Klux Klan chapter sought to adopt a portion of Interstate 55. A federal appeals court ruled the state could not bar the KKK from participating in the program, and the high court declined to review the case, letting that ruling stand. However, the Missouri Department of Transportation eventually kicked the KKK out of the program because members were not picking up trash as agreed, spokesman Bob Brendel said Monday. The state also named the stretch of I-55 after civil rights activist Rosa Parks, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Georgia has been participating in the Adopt-A-Highway program for more than 20 years. The program provides advertising for sponsors who agree to clean a stretch of road on a sign posted along the stretch. ""Any civic-minded organization, business, individual, family, city, county, state, or federal agency is welcome to volunteer in the Georgia Adopt-A-Highway program,"" the DOT website says. There is no charge to sponsors, Goldberg said. ""We provide the safety vest and materials to collect the trash. We provide what's needed to do the program ... their contribution is the labor."" Chambers said the group is more than 100 strong. ""We have a lot of support,"" she said. ""I don't see why we can't (adopt the stretch of highway),"" she said. ""Would it be any different if it was the Black Panthers or something? Someone always has some kind of race card."" On its website, the International Keystone Knights of the KKK says it is ""fed up with the Federal tyranny and oppression of Reconstruction, and the time was ripe for Clandestine Armed Resistance.""

"Karachi, Pakistan (CNN) -- For the second time in two days, Pakistan's largest and busiest airport was forced to shut down after militants launched a brazen attack on airport security forces. Tuesday's assault targeted the Airport Security Forces academy near Karachi's Jinnah International Airport, the airport's manager told CNN's Saima Mohsin in Karachi. Security forces told CNN that an unknown number of gunmen attacked the academy's entrance and were met with an armed response. The attackers fled, and no one was killed in the attack, officials said. Once again, the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility. ""This wave of attacks will be continuing in retaliation for the shelling and atrocities of the government,"" spokesman Shahidullah Shahid said by phone Tuesday from an undisclosed location. Ten militants stormed the same airport's cargo area late Sunday night, leading to an hours-long siege that left 36 people dead, including the assailants. The Pakistani Taliban also claimed responsibility for that assault, saying the attack was retaliation for the death of former chief Hakimullah Mehsud, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in November in North Waziristan. The militant group, also known as the TTP, had warned of more carnage starting Tuesday. Shahid said earlier this week that the Pakistani Taliban would engage ""in a full-out war with the Pakistani state, starting on June 10."" But the airport itself was safe Tuesday, Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority said. ""#Jinnah Airport is safe, #ASF academy is under attack,"" the aviation authority tweeted Tuesday. The Civil Aviation Authority said flights were temporarily suspended but later resumed Tuesday. By Tuesday afternoon, the situation was ""under control,"" military spokesman Asim Bajwa said. ""3 to 4 terrorists fired near ASF Camp, ran away,"" Bajwa tweeted. ""No breach of fence, no Entry. Chase is on, situation under control."" Airstrikes kill 15 militants . Hours before the renewed violence in Karachi, the Pakistani military launched a deadly assault targeting nine militant hideouts Tuesday. At least 15 militants were killed in the airstrikes on Khyber Agency, in tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, the Pakistani military said. A military spokesman said he could not confirm whether the airstrikes were directly related or in response to the violence at Karachi's airport earlier this week. But it's those kinds of attacks that the Pakistani Taliban warned would spur more violence from their end. When the TTP claimed responsibility for Sunday's airport attack, it called on the government to end airstrikes -- or face more attacks like the Karachi airport terror attack. Apparently, the TTP followed through with its promise. History of terror . The Pakistani Taliban, formally known as Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, has long conducted an insurgency against the Pakistani government. ""Their primary target is the Pakistani state and its military,"" said Raza Rumi of the Jinnah Institute, a Pakistani think tank. ""It resents the fact that (Pakistan) has an alliance with the West, and it wants Sharia to be imposed in Pakistan."" The U.S. Justice Department charged Mehsud in 2010 for his alleged involvement in a 2009 bombing at the United States' Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost, Afghanistan. The attack killed seven U.S. citizens, including five CIA officers and a member of Jordanian intelligence. Mehsud took over from Baitullah Mehsud, a fellow clan member, in 2009 after the latter was killed in a U.S. drone strike. Four years later, Hakimullah Mehsud suffered the same fate. CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Karachi; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Khushbu Shah and journalists Saleem Mehsud and Zahir Shah also contributed to this report.","The situation near Jinnah International Airport is under control, military spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- He was antisocial and difficult to work with at first. He'd clearly been abused by his father as evidenced by the deep, round scab near his shoulder. He hadn't been eating well. And he was so skittish that the slightest noise or motion set him off. But Army veteran Jeff Wilson needed a new dog, and this pound puppy -- a border collie-German shepherd mix -- was it. He named him Lobo, and it wasn't long before Wilson, 44, realized they had the same issues. ""We were kind of kindred spirits,"" he said. ""I think it really helped deepen our connection because he wasn't just helping me; I was helping him. I was helping him get past the same obstacles that I had. I had to recognize it in myself and get past that to help him."" Wilson is a former tank commander and flight engineer who isn't at liberty to speak about his time in Iraq other than to say he manned a machine gun while hanging out of the door of a helicopter. He can also say that he was often ""exposed to very dangerous situations"" during his 14 years in the service. He has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety from post-traumatic stress disorder, and he's not alone. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, 11% to 20% of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans are suffering from PTSD. Wilson said his depression turned him into a hermit. He would ""curl up and not talk to anybody,"" and his anxiety made it difficult to go into public. If he did leave the house, he was hypervigilant. If someone walked up behind him or dropped something that emitted a clatter, it triggered the ""fight or flight"" mechanism he'd groomed in the military. The anxiety was so bad that before he was diagnosed with PTSD, he went to the emergency room four times because he thought he was having a heart attack. He ""self-medicated"" so heavily with booze that it strained the relationship between him and his now-wife of two years. ""I was having to drink to numb all my senses and be quasi-normal,"" he said. But today, with Lobo by his side, Wilson is finding it easier to cope. The two have been working with Operation Freedom Paws, a nonprofit in Gilroy, California, that helps veterans train their own service dogs. It is run by Mary Cortani, a veteran and one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2012. Veterans in Focus: Celebrating, honoring veterans . When veterans train ""their own service dog, there are immediate benefits right off the bat,"" Cortani said. ""They have a mission and a purpose again. It gives them something to focus on and to complete. It gives them a sense of security and safety. ... They know they're not alone. They've always got their buddy at the end of the leash."" Now Wilson tells Lobo, ""Watch my back,"" and his four-legged friend stands behind him and gives him a nudge if anyone approaches. When something stokes Wilson's anxiety, Lobo senses it, jumps up and puts his paws on Wilson's chest so he can redirect his focus. ""Knowing he's there makes me comfortable,"" Wilson said. ""I'm not worried about the attacks. I still think about them, but I'm not hampered by them. I can go to the movies."" A study on hold . The Veterans Affairs Department recently put a study on hold that would determine the effectiveness of canine therapy for troops suffering from PTSD. Until that study is complete, the VA will continue providing dogs for a variety of ailments, but not PTSD. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Georgia, co-sponsored the 2009 legislation that kicked off the study. He was inspired by the strides that dogs helped his mother make from 1995 to 1998 after she was stricken with Alzheimer's. ""She wasn't very fond of dogs at all, but when she developed Alzheimer's, they became a key part of her therapy,"" the senator said. ""She was unable to really communicate at that time, but you could easily tell, emotionally, the calming effect the service dogs had."" Dogs: A medicine for mental health problems? Isakson said the VA is rewriting the parameters of the study to take into account the dogs' temperaments and the importance of matching the trainers, not just the dogs, with the patients. Yet not everyone is convinced ""the VA has the right stuff"" to conduct the necessary experiments, said Corey Hudson, CEO of Canine Companions for Independence and president of the North American chapter of the umbrella organization, Assistance Dogs International. Hudson said he hopes the study will be large enough to consider the broad gamut of symptoms associated with PTSD, as well as the anecdotal evidence suggesting canine companions can help tug the disorder's sufferers from their shells. ""There's something mystical and magical about dogs and people and placing them together,"" said Hudson, who has ""worked with and against the VA"" during his 22 years of experience with assistance dogs. Canine Companions for Independence has more than 900 puppy raisers and works to pair veterans with dogs regardless of whether the VA shells out for it. Hudson doesn't cite scientific studies, such as the one that says canine interaction increases a human's level of oxytocin, a hormone that reduces anxiety and blood pressure. Instead, he speaks about how dogs love unconditionally and don't judge. He explains how they naturally spark social interaction -- ""Cool dog; can I pet her?"" -- and how ownership precludes people from locking themselves in their homes, away from society. ""You can also use them as an excuse to get out of things or leave early,"" Hudson said. Case in point . Shadow is one pooch accustomed to being used for such occasions. The 2-year-old Labrador-Bernese mountain dog mix is the inseparable pal of Jennifer Haeffner, a seven-year Army veteran who had been housebound for about five years before meeting Shadow in the summer. ""He's a very active dog. It makes me do things. I don't have the option of hiding in the house. I have to go out,"" said the 41-year-old Ripon, California, resident. Share your story, honor a veteran . During Operation Desert Storm, where she served for about nine months between 1991 and 1992, she was sexually assaulted on multiple occasions by other service members, she said. It's a fairly common occurrence that befalls about one in four women in the military, according to the VA. It left her feeling alone in the world. She wanted to disappear. She forgot how to deal with people and eventually became a recluse, considering it a ""good month"" if she got out just once to shop for groceries. She didn't attend any of her large family's gatherings. Too many people and too much noise, she said. It terrified her. ""For years after that, I would go out and wander the streets late at night, just hoping someone would kill me because I wasn't brave enough to kill myself,"" she said. About five months ago, her therapist recommended that she meet Cortani. Cortani recalls Haeffner wouldn't look her in the eye when they met. Her leg bounced when she spoke, and she pressed her fingernails into her arm. Her boyfriend was constantly by her side. ""You could just tell the pain and the anguish that even meeting me for the first time was causing,"" said Cortani, an Army veteran herself. Who's your CNN Hero of the Year? Vote now . Operation Freedom Paws teaches participants to train their own dogs, to customize their behavior. First, the dogs learn to sit, then heel -- the basic stuff. Shadow now knows how to pick things up for Haeffner so she doesn't put stress on her bad back and hips. He acts as a barrier, physically putting himself between her and any new people she meets. When she wakes up feeling gloomy, he lets her stay in bed and pet him until she's ready to face the day. If she hears a sound during the night, he stays by her side as she checks it out, and Shadow is quick to snap her out of nightmares. ""He'll breathe on me or lay his head across mine to wake me up,"" she said of her 55-pound companion. ""If I'm in a bad mood, he'll come over and insist I play with his toy or lay his lead in my lap or lick my feet -- cheer me up."" Cortani said the difference between the Haeffner of five months ago and the Haeffner of today is like ""night and day."" She builds friendships. She's been to the aquarium. She's gone horseback riding. She goes places without her boyfriend. ""She's creating her own new normal,"" Cortani said. Added Haeffner: ""I'm much better now. I'm happier.""

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Anna Loginova was, for many Russians, a feminine icon -- bridging the glamorous world of modeling and the murky depths of Russian crime. Anna Loginova is photographed in one of her last shoots for the Russian edition of Maxim magazine. But this week, the stunning Loginova became a victim of the criminals she made sure could not get to her millionaire clients. She was killed trying to stop a thief stealing her own car on a busy Moscow street. As a glamour model, 29-year-old Loginova often appeared on the covers of Russian magazines, scantily clad. She fronted advertisements for high-profile brands in Russia, like the German carmaker BMW. But behind the glossy images, Loginova had another profession: She was an experienced bodyguard, trained in martial arts, commanding high prices to protect Russia's wealthy elite. One notable client was Russian boxer Kostya Tszyu.  Watch editor describe how she never had fear » . Having a female bodyguard is more than just a status symbol in Russia. Industry insiders say women bodyguards are not recognizable and, thus, allowed to sit at tables with their clients during dinners and other events -- unlike their male peers who are usually forced to wait in the lobby. Those who knew Loginova say she was passionate about her double life, saying she saw no contradiction between her femininity and her dangerous job as a bodyguard. ""She was kind and sweet, not like a terminator, not like Sigourney Weaver in 'Aliens,'"" said Igor Cherski, editor of Maxim magazine's Russian edition, which commissioned her last glamour shoot. ""But I feel that she was not afraid of anything. There was no fear in her eyes,"" he added. It seems that fearlessness may have gotten her killed. On a busy street in southeastern Moscow on Sunday night, police say they recovered her battered body after she tried to prevent her Porsche Cayenne from being stolen -- clinging on to the high-end SUV as it sped away. The vehicle was later found abandoned. ""According to eyewitnesses, an intruder just threw her out of the car,"" explains Oleg Pavlov, a special police investigator in charge of the investigation. ""She grabbed the door handle, but when the car took off and picked up speed, she let go."" No one has been arrested in connection with the killing. Russian media have been giving the killing prominent coverage, with witnesses expressing their shock that this kind of crime could happen. But luxury car theft in Moscow is not uncommon, and Loginova herself was no stranger to it. In her last magazine interview, she described how she foiled another carjacking just four months ago as she parked her car outside a flashy Moscow fashion boutique. ""So while I was closing my car, a guy of 30 years old or slightly older jumped on me,"" Loginova said. ""So I did a jujitsu move -- I bent his hand that grabbed mine, and struck him in the face with my elbow. It was a total surprise for him. ""As he was leaning back covering his face, I pulled a pistol from my bag and aimed it at him. He obviously realized that was no joke,"" she said. ""Then a car immediately pulled up nearby, something like a Honda, a dark car, and he jumped into it. And I still stood there with my pistol. I was actually spooked too."" That experience apparently emboldened Loginova to defend her car for a second time. But she was overwhelmed. Even the formidable skills of Russia's most famous -- and glamorous -- bodyguard couldn't save her. E-mail to a friend .","Russian model-and-bodyguard killed in Moscow during carjacking .

"(CNN) -- When Erin and Doug Halka began planning their wedding, they also looked for ways their guests could share photos of their ceremony and reception. ""We thought about using disposable cameras, putting them on all the tables, and letting people take pictures,"" said Doug Halka. But the thought of collecting cameras and developing film seemed antiquated. Then they came across WedPics, one of several photo-sharing apps for weddings. The app lets guests upload images directly to a private album viewable online by the bride and groom, wedding guests and other invitees. ""Everyone's got their phone in their pocket at all times,"" said Doug Halka. ""They're snapping pictures, they can immediately upload the photos, and now we have all the pictures to share with everyone else."" Since the Halkas signed up for WedPics, 423 photos have been uploaded to their page. The pictures range from their courtship to the engagement party and all the way to their April wedding in Atlanta. ""Now we have pictures just in one place to remember our entire wedding,"" Erin Halka said. No longer do brides and grooms have to rely on a single official photographer to capture all the key moments from their big day. Increasingly, couples are crowdsourcing their wedding photography through WedPics and similar photo-sharing apps such as Capsule, Wedding Party, Guest Shots and AppilyWed. Most wedding apps are free and are available for iPhones, iPads and Android devices. Guests can also upload images to the apps' websites from a desktop or digital camera. Online wedding albums are kept private unless couples enable social sharing, which allows guests to share photos and videos back out to their existing social networks. ""It enables every couple to create a private social network around each of their individual weddings,"" said Justin Miller, CEO and co-founder of WedPics. ""We see people uploading photos and videos from early on in their engagement all the way through the honeymoon."" Incorporating technology at weddings has become increasingly popular. According to a recent survey from wedding site TheKnot.com, 19% of couples are using wedding apps to crowdsource their photos and another 41% are considering doing so. Other couples are taking this a step further by inviting guests to share their wedding photos in real-time streams on social media. ""A lot of couples are creating their own custom hashtags for their wedding and then encouraging guests to take photos and upload them to Instagram and sometimes Twitter,"" said Anja Winikka, site director for TheKnot.com. Still, Winikka doesn't see apps or hashtags replacing the professional photographer at weddings. ""The one gripe I might hear is that guests kind of get in the way,"" she said. ""If you have a bunch of guests with their phones up, it changes the look of the photo entirely. On the other hand, I don't hear photographers who are worried that this is going to take away from their business."" Wedding photos: When snap-happy guests go too far . The prospect of a sea of smartphones and point-and-shoot cameras sticking out of the aisles has led some couples to want to unplug. According to TheKnot's survey, 28% of brides have either asked or are planning to ask their guests not to take photos during the ceremony. ""Unplugged weddings have become sort of a trend because it's so common for everybody to have their phones out,"" Winikka said. ""The idea there from the couples' perspective is that everyone is going to be really present."" Even so, a lot of couples still want as many photos as possible to remember the big day, she added. Since 2012, more than a million people, including couples and their guests, have signed up for WedPics, Miller said. Miller started the company in his basement in Raleigh, North Carolina. He had 12 people working for him full time when his young company was featured in the local newspaper. ""The day after (the story) was released, we got a knock on the door with somebody showing an eviction notice,"" he said. ""It turned out to be a blessing in disguise because we landed our first tech angel investor."" Since then, WedPics has moved offices and raised even more money. The company recently closed their first round of venture-capital funding, and future prospects look bright. After all, said Miller, ""People are always going to be getting married.""","A batch of apps will collect your wedding guests' pics in one place .

"(CNN) -- After President Obama announced his support for same-sex marriage, a group organizing a fundraiser on his behalf suddenly had to find a bigger venue. The event, featuring the pop singer Pink, is one of two LGBT-organized fundraisers Obama is expected to attend on the West Coast on Wednesday. A CNN analysis of President Obama's biggest fundraisers, known as bundlers, shows that at least 33 -- or about one in every 16 bundlers -- is openly gay. Together, they have raised at least $8 million for the campaign between January and the end of March. CNN poll: Majority of Americans say they have gay friends, family members . By contrast, in the same period, bundlers from the television, movie and music industry, some of whom attended a recent high-profile fundraiser hosted by actor George Clooney, raised $6.8 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Interactive: Celebrities back candidates for president . While campaign finance laws require donors to disclose their full names, addresses, occupations and employers, there is no box to check for sexual orientation. Nor does the law require candidates to release information about their bundlers. Under prodding from watchdog groups, presidential campaigns have released bundler data in past elections. Obama's campaign has released its list. Republican candidate Mitt Romney's campaign has not. In CNN's analysis, only bundlers who have disclosed their orientation in past CNN reporting or in trusted LGBT publications were counted as gay. The Washington Post has reported that as many as one in six bundlers supporting Obama are gay. The Advocate Magazine estimates one in five. Glancing down the names on the bundlers list released by the Obama campaign for the first quarter, it is easy to find people known for their work on behalf of the LGBT community. Tim Gill, a software entrepreneur who runs a large Colorado-based foundation that backs gay rights projects, has already contributed $672,800 with his partner Scott Miller to the Obama for America campaign. Fred Eychaner, who owns the Chicago-based Newsweb Corp., has donated $1,220,550 so far. He co-hosted a $35,800-per-person LGBT organized fundraiser for Obama in February. Kathy Levinson, the former president and CEO of the Menlo Park, California-based Etrade, gave $202,150. The LA Gay and Lesbian Center Women's Night named Levinson a ""Community Role Model"" in 2000. She was instrumental in raising money to stop the anti-same-sex marriage law in California. Donations made after Obama announced his support for same-sex marriage May 9 won't be released until mid-June, when the campaign files its second-quarter reports with the Federal Election Commission. Many LGBT bundlers have maintained a close relationship with the president throughout his first term. A state dinner in March was attended by bundlers Gill; Eychaner; Barry Karas, a former Human Rights Campaign board member; James (Wally) Brewster, senior vice president of General Growth Properties, a real estate investment trust that owns and operates shopping malls; Dana Perlman, a corporate lawyer who has served as co-chair of the Obama/DNC LGBT Leadership Council; Joseph Falk, a Miami mortgage broker and others. Support for Obama from the LGBT community was challenged after the initial excitement of his first campaign, largely because of what was perceived as his lukewarm support on same-sex marriage. Some say a low point came during the election in 2008, when evangelist pastor Rick Warren asked Obama how he defined marriage and he called it ""a union between a man and a woman."" He added: ""For me as a Christian, it is a sacred union. God's in the mix."" He further angered the community by picking Warren to deliver his invocation at the presidential inauguration. Actor Alan Cumming wrote in 2010, ""We keep hearing that Obama is an ally, that DADT [the 'don't ask, don't tell' policy that kept LGBT people from openly serving in the military] will end under his watch, but what do we actually get? Diddly squat."" Dustin Lance Black, who won a best screenplay Oscar for ""Milk,"" a movie biography of the gay San Francisco politician Harvey Milk who was gunned down because of his sexual orientation, said last year that he had been an Obama supporter before but might sit out the upcoming election. When President Obama finally signed the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell"" and ""evolved"" in his position on marriage by saying he was in favor of it for the LGBT community, both Black and Cumming did more than just say they supported the president. They donated money. They also encouraged others to do the same. David Mixner, who started one of the first LGBT-themed PACs in the late 1970s, said the community has come a long way in being accepted in electoral politics. ""We had some candidates who wouldn't take our money back then because they didn't want to be associated with anyone who was gay,"" Mixner said. He said he believes that changed with the Clinton administration, which the PAC raised $4 million to support. ""Now the community knows how to raise money and contribute on their own and we are more than welcome at the table."" The LGBT community is such an important part of this president's re-election effort that the Obama for America campaign hosts a special section for it on its website. It includes a video discussing the president's support for LGBT issues narrated by actress Jane Lynch, who is openly gay. It also offers Obama merchandise like T-shirts and drink koozies to bring to Gay Pride events this summer. The president has already attended several LGBT-organized fundraisers, including one in New York hosted by openly gay singer Ricky Martin, the Futuro Fund, and Obama for America LGBT Leadership Council. Another event in Washington, hosted by Karen K. Dixon and her partner, Dr. Nan Schaffer, was rumored to have raised more than a million dollars for the campaign, although the Obama team won't comment on the record about fundraising. Tickets for one of the California events were selling so well the campaign had to find a larger venue. There also is great interest in a Chicago fundraiser co-hosted by LGBT bundlers Brewster and Bob Satawake. The couple has already raised $288,663, according to the CNN analysis. ""I think there has always been a strong base of support from LGBT people for the president,"" said Michael Cole-Schwartz, spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign, whose incoming president Chad Griffin is a bundler. ""He earned even more respect from the community -- from repealing 'don't ask, don't tell,' to signing the hate crimes law giving the first civil rights protection for us in federal law, to coming out against DOMA,"" the Defense of Marriage Act that defines marriage for federal purposes as unions exclusively between a man and a woman. ""Now, with his saying he believes in full marriage equality, we have another reason for people in our community to be generous with their time and money."" It is difficult to know if there are any openly gay bundlers for the Republicans, because Romney has not disclosed his bundler list. The Republican candidate has, however, voiced his opposition to civil unions and supports a federal amendment to the U.S. Constitution to deny same-sex couples the right to marry. But some gay Republicans say Romney is not totally close minded on LGBT issues. ""On gay issues, where Romney stands is not as black and white as it seems,"" said R. Clarke Cooper, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, an organization for gay and lesbian Republicans. ""One thing he has been consistent on, as governor and as a candidate for president, is he has spoken in broad terms about ending discrimination in the workplace. He has said there is no room for it."" Cooper said the Log Cabin Republicans haven't decided yet if they will endorse Romney. That announcement will come sometime this fall. He does believe, though, that there are gay donors to Romney's campaign. They just might not be as outspoken. ""We joke that at Pride (festivals), the question we most often ask other Republicans we see there is, 'Are you out?' Meaning 'out' about your politics yet.""","A CNN analysis of Obama's biggest fundraisers shows about one in every 16 is openly gay .

"(Mashable) -- HP has announced a major new initiative and a slew of new devices that enable users to print from any device to a web-enabled printer by simply using e-mail. The idea -- which builds off the Google Cloud Print announcement we saw back in April -- starts with giving each printer its own unique e-mail address. That printer's owner (and their designated family, friends, and colleagues) can then print documents by sending it an email from a smartphone, from a tablet, or any other device that allows it. Called HP ePrint, the technology eliminates the need for installing drivers and enables a variety of new apps and services. Putting Documents in the Cloud . The new printers that HP is unveiling today along with ePrint can connect directly to Google Cloud using their touchscreen interface. That means users can print Google Docs directly from the cloud without using their desktop computer, as well as scan documents directly to their Google Docs account. Other Google services like Calendar and Picasa for photos are also supported. Similarly, Box.net and Docstoc users can also retrieve and push documents to and from the cloud through new print apps. A New Opportunity for Publishers . Another area HP is exploring with the ePrint concept is scheduled delivery. This allows users to get content printed at specific times -- for example, getting a customized daily newspaper printed out every morning that they can take with them on the train. MSNBC has signed on as a partner to pilot this concept, and HP has teamed with Yahoo to sell the ads, which, you can imagine could include a mix of contextual advertising and locally relevant promotions and coupons. Another Platform for Developers . Beyond productivity and news, initial apps include Facebook for printing photos and events and MapQuest for printing maps and directions. HP also sees a big opportunity for providing different types of activities for parents and kids, and to that end has signed on Crayola for coloring pages and PBS for a variety of education-driven printing. As for the market size for developers here, HP says it expects to ship, ""tens of millions of web-connected printers"" by the end of next year. Currently, developers interested in building apps need to apply for access to HP's SDK. Why's HP Doing This? Beyond selling printers, HP needs to sell ink. With more and more types of documents getting digitized and smartphones replacing former functions of printers (think coupons and tickets), HP needs new ways to drive printer usage. Web-connected printers fill this need in a few ways. First, they connect to the ever growing cloud for business users and make their lives easier. Second, the email-to-print concept clearly has the potential to drive new kinds of usage, both from business users and consumers who do things like print photos and news. Finally, there's also opportunities for developers to create sticky apps -- perhaps not on the scale we've seen in mobile, but with HP betting the future of its printers on web connectivity, you can bet we'll see some big winners emerge from the developer community. HP will dive into these topics at apress conference this morning to kick off Internet Week New York, where I'll be moderating a panel with a number of the players involved in the new ePrint initiative. We'll try and bring you video of the discussion later on. Disclosure: HP is a sponsor of Mashable's Internet Week New York channel. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- With the wind in her hair, the ice cold air on her cheeks and powder flying from her skis, Grete Eliassen took her sport to new extremes. The American hit the ramp hard, soaring 31 feet above the snow before returning to earth a world-record holder. That monumental leap in Utah three and a half years ago confirmed Eliassen's status as a force in her emerging discipline. Less than a decade after turning her back on downhill ski racing, it was a moment for the freestyle star to savor. ""I was on the Norwegian national team but I quit ski racing because it wasn't fun for me anymore,"" she told CNN. ` ""I love powder, I love getting air."" As a teenager Eliassen had to choose between following her dream and pursuing her passion. Downhill racing and a shot at Olympic gold was a possibility, but she opted for a career in the discipline she loved -- freestyle skiing. ""I thought I would go to the Winter Olympics for ski racing, when I decided that wasn't my passion I let my Olympic dream go,"" said the 27-year-old, who was born in the U.S. but has a Norwegian father. With Russia's first Winter Games drawing ever closer, the two-time X Games gold medal winner could get one last chance to fulfill her childhood dream. Slopestyle is a freestyle skiing discipline that sees competitors tackle a variety of obstacles, such as jumps and rails, as they descend a downhill course. Rather than being ranked by time, skiers are judged on the variety and difficulty of the tricks they perform as they traverse the obstacles. At Sochi 2014, it will be part of the Olympics for the first time. ""I've been watching the Olympics since I was a little girl,"" said Eliassen, who is based in Salt Lake City -- which hosted the 2002 Winter Games. ""It's my favorite show every four years, watching all the female athletes. ""I've been following my heart the whole time having fun, now it's back in my sights. It is crazy how dreams you think could never happen can happen. ""This is my only shot at the Olympics. I'm getting older and I've competed a lot in this sport, I know this will be my one and only shot."" Slopestyle is the latest event to make the transition from the modern, high-octane world of the X Games into the ancient, rarefied confines of the Olympic arena. While Eliassen is embracing this new chapter in the short history of her sport, she is also keen to pay tribute to slopestyle's X Games roots. ""The X Games has always been our Olympics because in the past we never had the Olympics,"" explained Eliassen. ""This year is definitely going to be different. We can look at snowboarding, where usually in an Olympic year it's a little toned down at the X Games, some athletes don't do it. ""For our sport it's important to do it all, all of the contests which have been there since the beginning like the X Games. It's the birthplace of our sport."" The inclusion of slopestyle in the Olympic program has brought Eliassen under the umbrella of the U.S. ski team, giving her access to coaches and facilities which were previously inaccessible. ""Before the Olympics my training consisted of going to the gym, building up my muscle to prevent injury,"" she said. ""But now we're part of the U.S. ski team I have a strength and conditioning coach, I have an air awareness coach for trampoline skills -- anything in the air and more gymnastic. ""There's been so much more coverage of our sport. I've done way more media interviews. I'm just really excited to be a part of it."" The Olympics and the media circus which accompanies the Games has helped slopestyle's profile hit new heights. Eliassen hopes the young sport can continue to go from strength to strength. ""I turned professional age 17, I won the U.S. Open, shortly after that I won the X Games and I kept winning and winning,"" she said. ""I've been in the sport for over a decade now, which is incredible. I've seen it grow from such a little thing ... I was the only girl in my terrain park, now I see girls in there every day, which is amazing. ""Now I get to see it grow into the Olympics, which is really cool."" The final U.S. selection competitions take place in December and January. If Eliassen is picked she will complete a journey which began when she was a child bouncing on a trampoline in her parents' backyard. ""I had a little garden trampoline,"" she said. ""I have a bigger trampoline now, you can jump really high, which is crazy. ""I'm not sure how I learned all of these tricks on my garden trampoline, but I did."" Pushing the envelope has always been Eliassen's style, culminating in her history-making leap in 2010. ""When I did my world record jump, I jumped 31 feet,"" she said. ""You don't do that first. You start off with a small jump and you build up to a medium jump. It's always progression. You start off small and you work your way up. ""Our sport is all about progression and making things look newer, the other sports are quite regimented. You never know what you're going to see in our sport."" Come February, slopestyle fans could see Eliassen with a gold medal around her neck.","Grete Eliassen is a U.S. slopestyle skier aiming for Sochi 2014 .

"(CNN) -- More than 200 dinghy sailors caught in heavy weather off the coast of Northern Ireland have been accounted for and have now returned to shore, the coast guard says. A rescue operation was launched Monday after news that 87 boats were in difficulty, at Strangford Lough inlet, in County Down. Twenty people ended up in the water, 10 of whom needed medical attention, with most showing signs of hypothermia, Liam Colquhoun of the Belfast Coastguard said. ""We have now been told by our rescue units on scene that everyone has safely returned to shore and that no one is missing,"" Colquhoun said. ""The weather conditions on scene have been pretty treacherous, with winds gusting up to 60 mph."" In a statement earlier, the coast guard said that it had been alerted to the situation just before 2 p.m. (1 p.m. GMT). Two helicopters -- an RAF aircraft from Wales and an Irish coast guard helicopter -- were called to help, alongside vessels from the coast guard and Royal National Lifeboat Institution, or RNLI. Bernard Roddy, a volunteer for RNLI at the scene, told CNN that the weather had been good, but a random squall had hit, causing a large wave that overturned a number of dinghies. The East Down Yacht Club, based at Strangford Lough, is hosting the world championships for the GP14 class of sailing dinghy, with Monday the first day of racing. The boats are two-man recreational dinghies.","NEW: All involved in a mass dinghy capsizing in Northern Ireland have been accounted for .

"(CNN) -- They're books you've likely seen in the hands of readers at the pool or under the shade of a beach umbrella, often a dog-eared paperback folded in two and smeared with sunscreen. While there are no hard and fast rules about what constitutes a ""beach read,"" the idea is that they can be read quickly, or that they're light in tone. Always, they're captivating and preferably escapist. Now that beach season has arrived, we quizzed five best-selling authors about their favorite summer reads. Of course, they're each having busy seasons, working on new novels or showing off those that debuted recently. But they all plan to have some quality time with books. Click through the gallery above to see what makes each author's reading list for the coming months, and read on to learn about their all-time favorite beach reads. Emma Donoghue, author of ""Frog Music"" For summer, Emma Donoghue, of ""Frog Music"" and ""Room"" fame, wants ""a meaty plot; brilliant language; extra points for hilarity."" She wants something she can read for hours on end, ""anything too delicious to spoil by only reading it in 10-minute snippets when you're tired."" Books from two Pulitzer Prize winners -- Jhumpa Lahiri and Michael Cunningham -- are on her to-read list this summer. But a beach read doesn't even need to be a book, Donoghue said. ""When I'm on beaches I read magazines, because then it doesn't matter so much if my kids spatter them with sunblock, mud or juice."" Joshua Ferris, author of ""To Rise Again at a Decent Hour"" Joshua Ferris, who wrote the National Book Award finalist ""Then We Came to the End,"" said he doesn't vary his reading choices, regardless of the time of year. Classics like ""Desert Solitaire"" make his summer reading list this year. ""What I bring to the beach is whatever I'm reading at the moment, and what I'm reading at any given moment usually concerns death, misery and marital discord, which don't seem too beachy,"" Ferris said. ""I find it impossible to alter my reading for the sake of a season, and I never want to take a vacation from being honestly and firmly in the world."" His favorite vacation read of all? ""The back of a beer bottle."" Michael Koryta, author of ""The Prophet"" A good story is important to Michael Koryta, whose new novel, ""Those Who Wish Me Dead,"" debuts in June, but a vivid setting is key. ""It would need to be a very atmospheric book, one that transports you to another place. The setting need not be tropical but I feel it should be remote or at least romantic,"" he said. This summer, Stephen King's ""Mr. Mercedes"" and Jo Nesbo's ""The Son"" make his list. But Koryta called Stephen King's ""Bag of Bones"" hard to beat and said ""Jaws"" by Peter Benchley ""redefined the way people looked at the ocean from the beach."" Sarah Lotz, author of ""The Three"" Sarah Lotz, whose novel ""The Three,"" was released in May, prefers a beach read ""that can be put down and picked up without straining my brain (it's quite easily strained)."" She said crime and fantasy are among her favorites, ""something I can lose myself in."" This summer, books by Stephen King and Lauren Beukes make her reading list. But Lotz said she'll never forget reading V.C. Andrews' ""Flowers in the Attic"" as a preteen. ""I think the whole of my generation was glued to it in the '80s,"" she said. ""It's a truly horrible novel in a lot of ways, but I was absolutely sucked in by the melodrama of it, and whenever I think of it, I smell coconut suntan oil."" Jojo Moyes, author of ""The Girl You Left Behind"" Jojo Moyes, whose romance ""The Girl You Left Behind"" will be available in paperback in June, said vacation is the perfect opportunity for something more challenging. This year, it will be ""The Vacationers,"" by Emma Straub. ""The ability to sit and read for long stretches means that I read books that might be a little more challenging than in my everyday life, when I tend to fall asleep after two pages,"" Moyes said. ""A couple of years ago, I read Hilary Mantel's 'Bring Up The Bodies,' which I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have managed at the end of a working day."" Last summer, Moyes started reading George R.R. Martin's ""Game of Thrones"" series and said it was ""slightly odd to be reading about medieval blood and gore and walls of ice while lying in the idyllic warm French countryside. But it worked.""

"(CNN) -- ""My thighs cramping up on the very first day ... the mental trauma ... physical adversity ... I felt a great deal of fear wondering how I would make it through the next month,"" says Akshay Nanavati. The 30-year-old American businessman and former Marine is describing his 28-day run across Greenland in 2012, dragging a 190-pound sled. ""Waking up, swallowing down the most disgusting freeze-dried food, packing up our tents and skiing for up to 12 hours a day in temperatures so cold that on some days my entire beard would be covered in ice. ""This was my life for one month, except for the five days we were stuck in storms so powerful, the inside of our tent sounded like a washing machine."" Nanavati finally completed the journey 20 pounds lighter in bodyweight, with mild frostbite on his fingertips, a swollen ankle and a sunburned nose. And he's going to do it all again, about 190 times. His mission is to run across every country in the world in the next 20-25 years. There is no globally accepted definition for the number of countries in the world. The United Nations puts the figure at 193 and the U.S. State Department puts it at 195. But that's a lot of running, whichever authority you listen to. It's the first time this specific feat has been attempted, though other similar attempts have been recorded, and this former Marine is doing it in reaction to a Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnosis he received after returning from a seven-month deployment in Iraq. ""When I returned home from Iraq, the VA (Department of Veterans Affairs) diagnosed me with PTSD,"" Nanavati tells CNN. ""I see now that it is not PTSD but post traumatic growth that has led to my decision to run across the world, because I choose to do something that inspires me to wake up every morning in order to make my life and the world better."" Making history . Tom Denniss became the fastest person to run a loop around the globe -- more than 20 countries -- from 2011 to 2013. Robert ""the runningman"" Garside trekked across 30 countries in five years during the late 1990s. (Editor's note: An earlier version of this story included information about Garside's run that has since been removed.) Starting with four crossings covering 125 miles (201 kilometers), around the Caribbean islands -- Barbados, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Antigua and Barbuda -- in June 2014, Nanavati aims to complete 20 countries by May 2015. The runner's troubled history . ""I began running at the age of 18 after recovering from a life of drugs that killed two of my friends,"" he says. ""Running and physical fitness became my way out of that life and into the Marines. ""It replaced the high I got from drugs."" The adrenaline junkie then discovered skydiving, mountain biking, scuba diving, rock climbing, ice climbing; ""anything that forced me to face my fears,"" he says on his website. Then came the Marines, Operation Iraqi Freedom and the PTSD diagnosis. If the runs themselves don't sound tough enough, Nanavati also plans to do it all while still running his current business, Existing2Living, which aims to help people achieve their potential. That business will help with the funding of the trips, and he has some small sponsorships too, from running shoe manufacturers. The most challenging trip will be one crossing Israel and Jordan, a 550-mile (885-kilometer) run planned for December 2014. ""Running allows me to experience the spectrum of the human condition: ultimate bliss, extreme suffering, complete stillness where there is no past and future and everything in between. ""In one run, I get to experience an entire human life."" His most hotly anticipated run will be across Rwanda, currently planned for August 2014. ""I wrote my history thesis about the genocide and am very fascinated by the resilience of humanity displayed by the people in [Rwanda],"" says Nanavati. ""Not only will that trip involve the run across Rwanda, it will involve working with genocide survivors as well -- the overall mission of this project is about connecting with humanity."" Pain, fear and extra shoes . His mission will depend on meticulous planning and a willingness to embrace fear, he says. ""Every time I look at my itinerary and realize how much work I have to do, not just in terms of training, but also in terms of logistical planning, it terrifies me,"" says Nanavati. He replace shoes every 350 miles (560 kilometers), requiring at least two pairs on each run. ""I have to not only plan for my next few runs, but plan for the ones after that as well to ensure success. ""On a 50-kilometer (31-mile) run last weekend, I went through many moments where I asked myself, 'Do I really want to do this for the rest of my life?'"" ""But as soon as I got back home, I found a 50-miler (80-kilometer run) that I want to run next because, despite the pain, there is nothing like that feeling of reward that comes with accomplishing something that pushed your mind, body and spirit to its limits.""","Akshay Nanavati plans to run across every country in the world .

"(CNN) -- Police began drilling Friday outside a suburban Detroit home in the search for Jimmy Hoffa, the labor strongman whose disappearance is one of the most notorious and mysterious in U.S. history. A tipster told police that a body was buried at the spot in Roseville, Michigan, about the time the Teamsters boss disappeared in 1975. The tipster did not claim it was Hoffa's body, authorities said. Police Chief James Berlin said Thursday that while the tipster's information seems credible, he's not convinced the body is Hoffa's because of the timeline. He spoke with the tipster August 22 and believes the person did see a burial. 2010: Digging into the Hoffa legend? The tipster did not come forward sooner out of fear, Berlin said. Dan Moldea, author of ""The Hoffa Wars,"" said the tipster, a former gambler, contacted him March 30. The tipster used to do business with a man who had ties to Anthony Giacalone, an organized crime figure who was supposed to meet Hoffa the day he disappeared, Moldea said. ""I am very skeptical,"" Moldea said of the planned dig. If Hoffa's burial had taken place at the spot, it would have been in full view of the neighborhood, the author argued. And if Hoffa's body was disposed of, it would have been done in a way that no evidence would be left years later, he said. It shouldn't take long to get a sample, which will be sent to Michigan State University for analysis, CNN affiliate WXYZ reported. The reading will determine whether there are human remains at the site but will not identify them, Berlin said. ""It took us a while to get the proper equipment to do what we're going to do. If this is a person, they've been down there for 35 years. What's a few more days?"" Berlin asked. Results from the soil testing should be available next week, the chief said Wednesday. ""If they are positive, we will then start excavating,"" Berlin said. The alleged burial site is under a concrete slab, and the residence is occupied by new homeowners, who've been ""cooperative and excellent to police,"" Berlin said. The FBI in Detroit had no comment on the planned search, and a statement from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said the Hoffa family had nothing to say at this time. ""The Hoffa family does not respond every time a tip is received by authorities. The FBI keeps the family informed, and they will have no comment until there is a reason to comment,"" the statement said. Hoffa remains among America's most famous, and in many ways infamous, missing people. His presumed death has vexed investigators for four decades. One of the most powerful union leaders at a time that unions wielded a great deal of sway over elections -- and were notoriously tied to organized crime -- Hoffa was forced out of the organized labor movement when he was sent to prison in 1967. He served time for jury tampering and fraud at a federal penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, until being pardoned by President Richard Nixon on December 23, 1971 -- on the condition that he not try to get back into the union movement before 1980. Two weeks before Hoffa's disappearance in 1975, federal investigators discovered that hundreds of millions of dollars had been stolen from the Teamsters' largest pension fund, Time magazine points out in its list of the top 10 most famous disappearances. Hoffa, 62, was last seen July 30, 1975, at Machus Red Fox restaurant in suburban Detroit. He was there ostensibly to meet with reputed Detroit Mafia street enforcer Giacalone and Anthony Provenzano, chief of a Teamsters local in New Jersey, who was later convicted in a murder case. Both men have since died. Hoffa believed Giacalone had set up the meeting to help settle a feud between Hoffa and Provenzano, but Hoffa was the only one who showed up for the meeting, according to the FBI. Giacalone and Provenzano later told the FBI that no meeting had been scheduled. The FBI said at the time that the disappearance could have been linked to Hoffa's efforts to regain power in the Teamsters and to the mob's influence over the union's pension funds. Police and the FBI have searched for Hoffa intermittently ever since. In September 2001, the FBI found DNA that linked Hoffa to a car that agents suspected was used in his disappearance. In 2004, authorities removed floorboards from a Detroit home to look for traces of blood, as former Teamsters official Frank Sheeran claimed in a biography that he had shot Hoffa. Sheeran died in 2003. Investigators ruled that blood found in the house was not Hoffa's. The FBI has a sample of his DNA from a hair brush. Two years later, the FBI razed a horse barn in Michigan after what it called ""a fairly credible lead."" But the disappearance remains unsolved. Urban lore long suggested that Hoffa was buried around the end zone at the former Giants Stadium in New Jersey. As TruTV puts it, the mystery surrounding Hoffa is not simply a ""whodunnit."" ""The likely suspects are all known, and their motives are well documented. The question is: Where? What exactly did they do to Jimmy Hoffa, and where did they dispose of his body?"" But over the years, numerous theories have been floated. In 1987, Joe Franco -- a former Hoffa strong-arm -- and a New York Times reporter published ""Hoffa's Man,"" which Fortune described as ""the hair-raising inside story of Jimmy Hoffa."" ""Rather than being kidnapped by rival union forces as law enforcement authorities have long speculated, Franco says Hoffa was abducted by two federal agents,"" Fortune reported. ""He thinks they drove Hoffa to a nearby airport, took off in a small plane, and pushed him out over one of the Great Lakes. Franco says he did not tell federal investigators this bizarre, and unverifiable, story because they would not grant him immunity."" Hoffa's son, James P. Hoffa, is the current president of the Teamsters. Photos: American gangsters .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A patient admitted to a New York City hospital with a high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms Monday is being tested for Ebola. He recently traveled to a country in West Africa where Ebola has been reported, Mount Sinai Hospital said in a statement. The patient was placed in strict isolation, and doctors are working to determine the cause of his symptoms. They expect to get test results back in a day or two. ""Odds are this is not Ebola. It's much more likely that it's a much more common condition,"" said Dr. Jeremy Boal, chief medical officer of the Mount Sinai Health System. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta agrees. About half a dozen people have recently returned from West Africa and gotten tested because of symptoms consistent with the disease. None of those cases has been confirmed as Ebola, Gupta said. Meanwhile, an American suffering from Ebola is expected to arrive in Atlanta on Tuesday from Liberia, where she contracted the deadly virus. Her plane departed early Tuesday morning, a source said. Missionary Nancy Writebol was set to travel aboard an air ambulance equipped with an isolation unit. It will land at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, and from there she'll be rushed to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital about 20 miles away. ""The reports from our medical doctors there on site caring for her is that she's in a more weakened condition; however, today has been a good day,"" said Bruce Johnson, president of SIM USA, where Writebol was working in Liberia. He told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" that her husband had told him Writebol's appetite was returning and that she had asked for potato soup. ""We're just grateful and very cautiously optimistic about how she's doing right now,"" Johnson said. Writebol is one of two Americans stricken with the disease while aiding Ebola victims in the latest outbreak in West Africa. Ebola has killed more than 700 people in three nations: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Their evacuation to Atlanta marks the first time anyone infected with the virus has been known to get treatment in the United States. Both patients will be treated at an isolation unit where precautions are in place to prevent it from spreading, unit supervisor Dr. Bruce Ribner said. The first American evacuee, Dr. Kent Brantly, was making progress since he arrived in Atlanta from Liberia on Saturday, a U.S. official said. ""It's encouraging that he seems to be improving,"" Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""That is really important, and we are hoping he will continue to improve."" Brantly, 33, is the first known patient with the deadly virus to be treated on U.S. soil. He landed at Dobbins and was quickly rushed to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital. A prayer service was held for Brantly on Sunday night at the Southern Hills Church of Christ in Abilene, Texas. A family friend reportedly read a statement from his family. ""We cannot share any news of Kent's condition but please know that we believe Kent will be healed and that healing will come from the hand of God. To say thank you is SO inadequate for what we're feeling! We are humbled & simply, blown away by the response,"" it read, CNN affiliate KTXS reported. Ebola doesn't spread through airborne or waterborne methods. It spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people. There is no FDA-approved treatment for Ebola, and Emory will use what Ribner calls ""supportive care."" That means carefully tracking a patient's symptoms, vital signs and organ function ad taking measures, such as blood transfusions and dialysis, to keep patients stable. The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding. Early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. They later progress to vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function -- and sometimes internal and external bleeding. Emory's isolation unit aims to optimize care for those with highly infectious diseases and is one of four U.S. institutions capable of providing such treatment.

"(CNN) -- When I heard that Melanie Griffith and Antonio Banderas are divorcing I was surprised at my own reaction, which was, honestly, sadness. I always thought they were an exciting couple -- both are passionate people who conquered a risky business, and each had a past that was just a little messy. Griffith had three marriages before meeting Banderas, two of which were to Don Johnson. Banderas had one previous marriage, but was certainly the epitome of the ""Latin lover"" in looks if not swagger. And yet they seemed deeply in love and stalwartly committed to each other over the years. I know -- they are a Hollywood marriage, which can be a minefield for marital stability. But for better or worse, these are also real people marrying with hopes of being together forever. Because they are famous, we follow their lives through the tabloid or lifestyle magazines. They become part of our daily landscape and in a strange way as we become invested in their welfare. I realized as a read the story of their breakup that I wanted them to stay together -- forever. I wanted their private lives to have the ""happily ever after"" of their movies. I thought this pair had deeper roots and a deep enough connection to last for the long run. So, I think my sadness came from the recognition about how unrealistic I was. Hollywood marriages face special pressures that hurt their odds of lasting forever. But even if they were an average couple, the truth is that having made it to 18 or 20 years as they did, does not, in the slightest, guarantee you a sealed forever deal. Marriages these days can fall apart at any stage of the relationship. The famously enduring marriage of Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward turns out to be more of an anomaly than a model. Really, when you think of it, Newman and Woodward were cast from a mold that was formed by a different generation and that mold appears to be broken. Now, long marriages have no guarantees of continuance, even if they have lasted decades. Just ask Robert Redford and Lola Van Wagenen (27 years) or Jerry Lewis and Patti Palmer (36 years). In fact, the statistics tell us that the biggest percentage increase in divorces is among people over 50. So if you thought that getting older formed a protective bubble over your relationship, think again. Lifetime marriage is turning into a crapshoot for many people, especially Baby Boomers. Maybe holding on till ""death do them part"" is least likely for Hollywood stars whose work takes a hard toll on their relationships and whose exit from marriages is not generally impeded by financial concerns. But really, no marriage is immune against what seems to be an epidemic of marital unraveling. Well, so be it. But we can do things that give us better odds of staying with our spouse. To me, that means we have to be intentional about our relationship every day, year, and decade we are together. We have to aim high, have a lot of fun, work hard at being each other's lover and friend and always do everything we can to repair problems along the way. If it ends, it ends -- but it shouldn't die without having been given every chance to live. So, lets be realistic. You can't predict the future. I thought about this as I was looking at a photo of Melanie Griffith and saw a huge tattoo on her arm that said ""Antonio."" Uh-oh -- I thought. If you yearn to have a name tattooed on your body, choose your mom's or the name of your first pet. Otherwise, take it from Melanie, Antonio and countless others: Even long marriages have an uncertain future. I am not saying to plan for an exit while you are trying to make a solid entrance, I am just saying -- take care and have a Plan B.","Melanie Griffith and Antonio Banderas are divorcing after 18 years of marriage .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich completed the $50m signing of Spanish midfielder Javi Martinez from Athletic Bilbao, on Wednesday. Martinez, part of the victorious Spain squad at the 2010 World Cup and the 2012 European Championship, had a $50m release fee in his Bilbao contract, but was required to pay the amount himself, which created huge tax liabilities for the player and complications for the German club. Bayern's chairman Karl-Heinz Rummennigge described the transfer as ""very complicated"" and accused Bilbao of ""refusing to cooperate from the very first day"" of negotiations. ""We've had tax and legal problems to solve over the last few days, but fortunately we've succeeded,"" he said. ""The player has made an indirect contribution by foregoing a large sum of his salary. Our management is convinced the player will do very well with us,"" he added. Despite being only 23, Martinez has made 201 appearances for Athletic Bilbao and was a key member of the side that enjoyed a surprise run to the final of last season's Europa League. The Basque native can play in central midfield, or as a center-back. ""Bayern are one of the best teams in Europe, and the whole world,"" Martinez told the club's website. ""There are so many top players here, all of them fantastic footballers. That's hugely motivating for me. And naturally, I'm looking to win trophies,"" In the English Premier League, Tottenham Hotspur announced the signing of Belgian midfielder Mousa Dembele from London rivals Fulham. ""We are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement with Fulham for the transfer of Mousa Dembele,"" Tottenham announced on their website. Neither side confirmed the fee involved, but it is believed to be in the region of $24m. Dembele was signed as a striker for Fulham from AZ Alkmaar ahead of the 2010-11 season, but thrived for the club after moving into a midfield role . ""Dembele originally joined Fulham as a forward, although his ability to drive forward with the ball and his eye for a pass saw him played in an attacking midfield role last season, a move that proved a huge success,"" explained a statement on the club website. Tottenham will be hoping the 25 year old can replace Luka Modric, after the creative Croatian midfielder completed his moved from Spurs to Real Madrid earlier in the week. ""Following two full seasons at Craven Cottage, the Club would like to thank Mousa for his contribution and wish him well throughout the rest of his career,"" Fulham said in a short statement on their website. In Italy, AC Milan further strengthened their attacking options with the capture of Bojan Krkic on a year long loan from Serie A rivals Roma. Krkic joined Roma from Barcelona last summer for $15m, but the Spanish club have the option to re-sign the player next summer for $16.25m. After making more than 100 appearances for Barcelona, Krkic enjoyed a fruitful debut season in Italy, scoring seven goals in 33 appearances. AC Milan will be hoping the young forward can help replace Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who moved to Paris St-Germain earlier in the season. In his final season at Barcelona, Krkic was, coincidentally, chosen to replace Ibrahimovic as Barcelona's number nine after the Swedish striker moved to AC Milan. Also on Wednesday, Bayer Leverkusen completed the signing of former Bayern Munich goalkeeper Michael Rensing, who was released by Cologne following their relegation last season. ""We have signed an experienced and high quality back up for our number one,"" explained Leverkusen managing director Wolfgang Holzhauser on the club's website. ""We've made this move as we are involved in three competitions."" North German side Hamburg have also made moves to strengthen their side before the close of the transfer window. Czech midfielder Peter Jiracek has moved from Wolfsburg, signing a four year contract with the Rothausen. In Spain, Atletico Madrid strengthened their defence with the capture of Domingo Cisma from Racing Santander. The defender played for Atleti's youth teams and declared he was ""back to stay"" at the club, despite only signing a one year deal. ""A special group of players is being assembled here and I hope my arrival will increase the competition for places,"" he said. Real Betis have completed the signing of French born Poland international Damien Perquis from Sochaux. Perquis has signed a three year contract after impressing during his brief appearances at Euro 2012.","Javi Martinez completes $50m move from Athletic Bilbao to Bayern Munich .

"(CNN) -- Those who live in fear today imagine that America is being overrun by foreign, disease-carrying, tax-sucking criminal hordes. They cannot imagine that immigrants, whether documented or not, could ever contribute to our country. They refer to the children and families trying to cross the southern border as ""illegals."" But to quote John Lewis, who fought 50 years ago for civil rights and fights now for immigration reform, ""There is no such thing as an illegal human being."" Language matters. Words are expressions of power and identity. And even something as trivial as punctuation can say a lot about what it means to become American. For instance, I never hyphenate. As I explain in my new book ""A Chinaman's Chance,"" I call myself ""Chinese American"" -- without a hyphen. American is the noun, Chinese the adjective. Or, rather, Chinese is one adjective. I am many kinds of American, after all: a politically active American, a short American, an earnest American, an educated American. This is not a quibble about grammar; it's a claim about the very act of claiming this country. The hyphenated form, ""Chinese-American,"" to me signifies a transaction between two parties, as in Chinese-American diplomatic negotiation or Chinese-American commerce and trade. The hyphen implies a state of interchange across nations. It does not name a person, much less a citizen. For the same reason, I never really accepted the label that my immigrant parents attached to me and other second-generation kids: ""ABC,"" or American-born Chinese. I understand why they used it. They had been formed in China. They were deeply culturally Chinese and as they tried to make their way in this country and raise kids, they hoped those kids would think of themselves the same way. We didn't, exactly. The second generation rarely does. While Chineseness was a deep influence on my palate and vocabulary and moral sensibility, I grew up in this land, an American. I went to Chinese school on Sundays, but I counted the minutes until I could get back to playing baseball with my best friend John. I was raised at home with a Chinese belief in family obligation and social propriety, but I was schooled everywhere else in an American spirit of individual invention and reinvention. Actually, my immigrant dad taught me this. He's the one who introduced me to the noxious phrase, ""a Chinaman's chance,"" which since the 1850s had meant ""slim to no chance."" When he came here in the late 1950s, he decided, with his wry sense of humor, to reappropriate this slur. He would apply it playfully to commonplace situations, such as saying that the Yankees had ""a Chinaman's chance"" of making a ninth-inning comeback. That's how I grew up. To call me ""American-born Chinese"" is to make my birthplace and upbringing incidental rather than central. It is to imply that wherever a person of Chinese ethnicity may be born, he is not truly of that place; he is just a sojourner, attached to a vast global web of Chinese. That's not the way of our nation. In America, immigrants become American -- and by so doing, change America. The change is accelerating. We've already become heavily Hispanic. Now -- to the surprise of many -- Asians have become America's fastest-growing group. People who look like me can no longer be presumed foreign until proven otherwise. We are becoming the new face of the United States. In 1914 or 1814, when Italians or Irish were coming in great waves (uninvited by government, by the way, and unsanctioned by law), ""becoming American"" meant assimilating to a white, WASP way. In 2014, it means entering a vibrant and more complex omniculture that mixes the styles and memes of the entire world. This shouldn't be scary. It should be exciting. For what makes America enduringly great is precisely this ability to synthesize the best of the rest of the planet. That's our edge -- as long as we don't blow it. Yes, not blowing it includes taking illegal immigration seriously because borders do matter, and so does enforcing borders. But it primarily means keeping our eye on the bigger picture: that we are stronger when we are more inclusive and better when we activate our full diversity. Welcoming and integrating legal immigrants is therefore a necessity. So is creating a pathway to citizenship for our undocumented neighbors, friends and colleagues so that we don't leave millions of people stuck in second-class limbo. There will never be a simple answer to the eternal American question, ""Who is 'us'?"" But in this moment when jobs feel scarcer and life feels more zero-sum, we have to make a conscious choice to be bigger than our fears. That, without hyphens or hyperventilating, is the true American way.","Eric Liu: Words are expressions of power and identity, and even punctuation matters .
Liu: As I explain in my new book, I call myself ""Chinese American"" -- without a hyphen .
He says the hyphenated ""Chinese-American"" signifies a transaction between two parties .
Liu: Similarly, ""ABC,"" or American-born Chinese, is also inadequate in its identity label ."
"(CNN) -- Amid the death and destruction of life in Gaza, a spark of hope for the future: A Palestinian couple have married in a makeshift wedding ceremony at the UNRWA shelter which has become their temporary home. Omar Abu Namar, 30, and Heba Fayad, 23, moved to the shelter -- a U.N. school in Gaza City's Shati refugee camp -- after their homes in Beit Lahiya were destroyed in the conflict with Israel, throwing their wedding plans into disarray. Fayad's white dress and other items for the wedding were lost, and she and her husband-to-be faced the prospect of having to postpone their special day indefinitely, before friends, family and others stepped in to help. ""I went to UNRWA and told them that I am engaged and asked them if they can help me to do the wedding,"" Abu Namar explained in an interview with the Watania Media Agency, published on YouTube. ""They said yes, we will help you with it. They stood by me, and helped with the wedding from A to Z."" UNWRA offered to host the wedding at the shelter, and even paid for the couple to spend their first few nights as husband and wife at a hotel, away from the crowds of thousands of fellow displaced people now living under the same roof. Those crowds -- the couple's new neighbors -- were in attendance as Abu Namar and Fayad celebrated their wedding. For many the party, complete with dancers, music, balloons and cake, offered a much-needed break from the bloodshed, and a chance to forget the troubles of recent weeks. ""Now that we are at the wedding, we have a change of spirits: enough depression and melancholy, this is something else,"" guest Haya Aziz told the Agence France-Presse news agency (AFP). UNRWA spokesman Christopher Gunness told CNN the wedding was a rare piece of good news for Gaza. ""It is truly heartwarming that amid the carnage and devastation we have a story of love and humanity -- it is a reminder of the dignity and the destinies that lie behind the statistics."" But he added that despite the individual romance of Abu Namar and Fayad's story, ""one must never lose sight of the fact that Gaza has seen its worst devastation in recent memory.""

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Open a car door on a summer day, and a sauna blast will quickly remind you just how seethingly, sticky hot it can get inside in just a short time. It's suffocating. For 22-month-old Cooper Harris, strapped all day into a child's seat in his father's SUV, as the sun baked it, it was fatal. Investigators in Georgia wanted to know how high the temperature climbed in that back seat, so this week they recreated that sauna heat in Justin Ross Harris' silver Hyundai Tucson. They drove it to the spot where it sat in the sun for seven hours on June 18, the day Cooper died. They have not released the data yet, but CNN weather experts believe temperatures could have climbed to nearly 140 degrees inside the car. The National Highway Traffic Safety Authority has corroborated the possibility. ""Even outside temperatures in the 60s can cause a car temperature to rise well above 110Â° F,"" the agency said. The test came in the same week that the Cobb County medical examiner's office said toxicology tests on the boy revealed nothing abnormal, meaning he apparently was not drugged or medicated. That report and the autopsy report -- which found the child's cause of death ""consistent with hyperthermia"" and that investigative information ""suggests the manner of death is homicide"" -- will not be released to the public until the investigation is complete, the office said Thursday. Cooper's father, Justin Ross Harris, is charged with murder and child cruelty. He has pleaded not guilty. Harris fired by employer . Harris, who worked for two years at the The Home Depot's corporate offices in the Atlanta suburb of Smyrna, has been terminated, a spokeswoman for the company said Thursday. Harris, a web designer, had been on unpaid leave since charges were filed last month. Catherine Woodling gave no details of the termination. A Home Depot charity fund paid for Cooper's funeral. Measuring temperatures at key times . During this week's car test, investigators parked in the same space that Harris did, WAGA reported, and measured the temperature at times of day that are key to the father's murder case: . -- At 9:30 a.m., when police say Harris pulled into the parking lot at The Home Depot's corporate offices. He normally would have taken Cooper to daycare then, but left him in the car. -- At 12:42 p.m., when the 33-year-old father placed light bulbs he had purchased inside the car. -- And at 4:16 p.m., when investigators say Harris drove off. Should the government step in to prevent hot car deaths? On the day Cooper died, the high temperature reached 92 degrees. Investigators used outside thermometers on Tuesday to monitor outdoor temperature rises. Dozens of children die in hot cars every year, the NHTSA said. People are in danger of dying of heatstroke when their body temperatures climb above 104 degrees and stay there for prolonged periods, according to the Mayo Clinic. Heat attacks the brain, heart, kidneys and muscles, the Mayo Clinic said. Victims can experience nausea and faintness, before organ damage sets in, eventually leading to death. The elderly and small children are particularly susceptible to heatstroke. Who is Justin Ross Harris? Death highlights key role of digital evidence . Uncomfortable details . Initially, police said the death of the toddler was the result of tragic absent-mindedness. They said the dad had apparently forgotten the boy was in the back seat of his Hyundai Tucson and apparently didn't remember until he was done with his workday, drove a couple of miles and pulled into a shopping center parking lot. But suspicions grew as police investigated, and Harris was charged. Investigators also have unearthed uncomfortable details in Harris' online activities. He has performed Internet searches on child death in hot cars, they said. While Cooper was left in the car, Harris was allegedly chatting via an online contact service with women. Police say that Harris, who is married, has, in the past, sent sexually explicit messages and photos on the service, including to an underage girl. Leanna Harris, Justin's wife, has not been named a suspect in the case. Officer Michael Bowman, a Cobb County police spokesman, said Monday, ""Leanna Harris has been interviewed. Detectives continue to work on the case."" Opinion: In hot car death, leave the mom alone . Police have alleged she behaved strangely in the days before and moments after the death of her 22-month-old boy.

"(CNN) -- FIFA says it will help police in Brazil with investigations into allegations that one of its commercial partners has been involved in a ticket scalping scandal. Brazilian authorities arrested Raymond Whelan, the English chief executive of FIFA partner company MATCH Hospitality, on Monday as part of an inquiry into the illegal sale of tickets for the 2014 World Cup. ""FIFA continues to fully collaborate with the local authorities and will provide any details requested to assist with this ongoing investigation,"" football's world governing body said in a statement. ""FIFA wants to reiterate as mentioned at various occasions its firm stance against any form of violation of the criminal law and the ticketing regulations, and is fully supporting the security authorities in our joint efforts to clamp down on any unauthorized ticket sales."" Police arrested Whelan at the Copacabana Palace hotel in Rio de Janerio for questioning as part of 'Operation Jules Rimet' set up to probe scalping. Whelan's Swiss-based company MATCH Hospitality describes itself on its website as ""the only company worldwide that is officially authorized by FIFA to offer and guarantee exclusive hospitality packages for every match of the FIFA World Cup."" The company issued a statement Tuesday in response to Whelan's arrest saying: ""Ray Whelan has been released from police custody and will assist the police with further enquiries. ""MATCH have complete faith that the facts will establish that he has not violated any laws. ""MATCH will continue to fully support all police investigations, which we firmly believe will fully exonerate Ray. In the meantime, Ray Whelan, as well as the rest of the MATCH personnel will continue to work on our operational areas of responsibility in order to deliver a successful 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil."" It emerged Tuesday that the Infront Sports and Media company presided over by Philippe Blatter -- the nephew of FIFA president Sepp Blatter -- also owns shares in MATCH Hospitality. ""Infront is a 5% minority shareholder of MATCH Hospitality,"" Infront said in a statement. ""Infront's President and CEO Philippe Blatter does not hold any position with MATCH Hospitality. Infront is fully supporting MATCH Hospitality in collaborating with the local authorities."" Whelan is among 11 people arrested on suspicion of illegal ticket selling at the 2014 World Cup. Authorities believe some of the tickets were sold to international tourists who had arrived in Brazil for the world's biggest sporting event. Brazilians have purchased the majority of the 2.5 million tickets on sale for the World Cup despite high prices. Media reports in Brazil Tuesday said that Whelan had subsequently been released by the police after an application by his lawyers. Last week, a cloud of controversy distracted from the football fiesta as match fixing claims surrounding Cameroon's participation in the event emerged. The Cameroon Football Association confirmed it is investigating allegations made in the German media that seven of its players were involved in match fixing during the group stage of the World Cup finals. The tournament continues on the pitch when host Brazil faces Germany in the first of the semifinals Tuesday.

"New York (CNN) -- Prosecutors say for now, they won't be charging the driver of a double-decker tour bus that collided with another bus in Manhattan's bustling Times Square Tuesday, injuring more than a dozen people. Police initially charged William Dalambert, 58, of Irvington, New Jersey, with driving while impaired, but preliminary tests did not show any drugs or alcohol in his system. So, Manhattan prosecutors declined to file charges ""until we we have completed our investigation,"" Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, said Thursday. He has been released. ""We are awaiting results of the full toxicology report,"" she said. ""We are taking this matter seriously and prosecutors in the Office's Vehicular Crimes Unit are conducting a thorough investigation."" Dalambert was driving a bus that struck another double-decker bus on Seventh Avenue, police said. At least 13 people were injured, one seriously, after the two tourist buses that traverse city neighborhoods collided about 4 p.m. Tuesday. The crash occurred near a normally packed sidewalk next to the TKTS booth at 47th Street and Seventh Avenue at Times Square, police and fire officials said. Authorities said a preliminary investigation revealed that a Gray Line double-decker tour bus, driven by Dalambert, was traveling southbound on Seventh Avenue and sideswiped a City Sights double-decker tour bus and a GMC Yukon, also traveling southbound on Seventh. The collision caused the Gray Line tour bus to go up on the sidewalk and strike a traffic light pole, which fell to the sidewalk. Investigators have clear video showing a bus closest to the sidewalk speeding through the intersection and striking an SUV and another bus that just passed the intersection, according to a law enforcement official who saw the video. The driver of that bus claimed he was having brake issues, the law enforcement official said. But an examination of the bus revealed no mechanical problems. By all accounts, the collision could have been worse. Earthcam video from the scene showed pedestrians running from the crash site moments before a towering pole crashed to the sidewalk, appearing to strike a man in the leg and narrowly missing his head. A fire official at the scene said the number of injuries was surprisingly low, given the size of the pole. Times Square is a popular launching spot for the ubiquitous double-decker buses, which take tourists around Manhattan. After the accident, dozens of tourists stood at what is sometimes called the ""Crossroads of the World,"" taking pictures and video of the crash scene.

"(CNN) -- Keith Olbermann -- formerly of MSNBC, formerly of Current TV, formerly of Fox, formerly of ESPN -- wants back in the game. More to the point, he wants to return to his sports roots by reuniting with ESPN. Now it would be easy to torpedo that idea by noting that Olbermann has burned bridges everywhere he has worked and could inflame things back at ESPN. But I won't. Instead, I'm going to lead a chant: Let's Go Keith!! It would be great fun to see him holding forth again on sporting matters. Is the guy supposed to stay sidelined for the rest of his life, just because he's got a bit of a temper? Don't the fans of America deserve better? Watch: Did George Stephanopoulos lay a glove on Dennis Rodman? The New York Times reports that Olbermann recently had dinner with ESPN's president, John Skipper, who says they had a fine time. But they weren't just shooting the breeze: ""Clearly he was looking to see if there was an entry point to come back,"" Skipper said. Olbermann, in turn, praised Skipper's ""vision and charm."" So to put it in betting terms, what are the odds? ""There was no real appropriate place for Keith to come back, nor did I feel like I was prepared to bring him back,"" Skipper told the Times. Wrong answer. ESPN is in the business of covering athletic competition, right? What could be more spellbinding than waiting to see whether Olbermann declares some jock the ""worst person in the world"" or, even better, grabs a baseball bat in some confrontation with the bosses? Watch: Do Mitt and Ann Romney get why he lost the election? I'm being facetious, of course. But I miss the guy, even though there have been times when he has thrown brushback pitches at me. But I'm going to rise above that, for the greater good of television. The thing about ubertalented people is that they're often difficult to manage. Olbermann is a great broadcaster, but sometimes he lets his anger get the best of him. He makes life very difficult for his bosses. The question, as always, is whether he's worth it. Olbermann worked for ESPN from 1992 to 1997, so he can claim, you know, it's a new century and all that. He and Dan Patrick were a very popular team as co-hosts of ""SportsCenter."" But then Olbermann left, prompting an ESPN executive to offer this classic quote: ""He didn't burn bridges here. He napalmed them."" Watch: John Boehner doubles down on street talk about Senate's backside . Abandoning sports for politics, Olbermann hosted ""The Big Show"" on MSNBC, riding the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky wave to prominence until he quit, saying he was ""ashamed"" of what he was doing. Next up was Fox Sports, where Olbermann worked for three years. ""I fired him. He's crazy,"" owner Rupert Murdoch later said. Olbermann has always blamed Rupe for his departure. After a brief stint at CNN, where he had also worked early in his career, Olbermann headed back to MSNBC and almost single-handedly revived the channel. Tapping into a surge of sentiment against President George W. Bush during the Iraq war, Olbermann's ""Countdown"" redefined MSNBC as cable's leading liberal outlet and boosted its ratings for eight years. But clashes with management grew. He was briefly suspended over making political donations, and the two sides severed their relationship. Olbermann resurfaced with a $10-million-a-year deal at Current TV, boasting about his independence from corporate media as Al Gore gave him the title of chief news officer. But the marriage quickly soured, with Olbermann complaining about the cheesiness of the facilities (""a daily logistical nightmare"" that ""more closely resembles cable access,"" according to an e-mail from his rep) and management complaining about temper tantrums, a mug-throwing incident and days off. After less than a year, the two sides wound up suing each other last spring. Now you might say this is a cautionary note for a future employer, and you might be right. But after a year of unemployment and tweeting mainly about sports, perhaps Olbermann has mellowed. Watch: Should Andrew Sullivan have suggested Pope Benedict XVI is gay? To be sure, ESPN has certainly tolerated its share of loudmouths, from the analyst who was let go for calling Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III a ""cornball brother"" to the commentator who uttered the n-word on the air. Olbermann's problems tend to unfold off the field, not in front of the camera, though he's occasionally apologized for going too far. And it couldn't hurt for ESPN to jazz things up. Skipper isn't exactly raising expectations, saying: ""There are not that many successful examples of people who have come back, in part because it's like water filling a vacuum. When somebody leaves, somebody else fills their place."" Sure, play it safe. Or throw the long pass and see what happens. Remember: Watching Keith Olbermann is a great spectator sport. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: There's talk that Keith Olbermann wants to return to ESPN .
He says Olbermann has been controversial at several leading media outlets .
Kurtz says Olbermann has great talent and deserves another shot at sports .
Kurtz: Working with Olbermann may not always be easy, but he can be worth the trouble ."
"(CNN) -- Michigan has dealt a tremendous blow to unions, approving a right-to-work measure in the heart of organized labor's industrial stronghold. The new law -- passed by legislators and signed hours later on Tuesday -- not only signals a change in America's so-called Rust Belt, but is also the latest sign that the power of organized labor is shrinking in the United States. American unions already have a fraction of the influence they did a few decades ago. Only about 12% of workers are union members, down from 20% in 1983, according to federal data. In the private sector, the plunge has been even steeper: union membership has dropped from 17% in 1983 to 7% today. That's partly because certain unionized industries have become a smaller part of the overall work force, particularly in manufacturing. It's also a result of government action. Michigan has become the 24th state to adopt a right-to-work law, which removes the requirement for people to pay unions to work at unionized agencies, effectively decreasing union funding and making it less likely that workers choose to organize. America's up and down relationship with unions . Union supporters in Michigan didn't go down without a fight. They staged a rally outside the state capitol in Lansing as lawmakers voted. ""People need to wake up and fight,"" teacher Sarah Zigler said at Tuesday's rally. ""People need to realize what unions have done for them. Who gave people the 40-hour work week? Who fought for workplace safety? Who brought you the weekend? Who brought you workers comp? Who gave people overtime pay?"" ""Unions!"" protesters shouted after each of her questions. Faces of the 'right to work' protest . For much of American history, unions have been credited with helping millions achieve the American dream and criticized for ""heavy-handed"" operations (They were also reviled for corruption in the days of Jimmy Hoffa.). But unions have long remained a force to be reckoned with. Today, Michigan becomes the latest state in the Rust Belt, the heart of America's manufacturing industry, to chip away at their power. Earlier this year, Wisconsin had its own showdown over the power of unions when Gov. Scott Walker -- who opposes unions -- overcame an attempt to recall him from office. The failed recall vote was fueled by anger over laws he pushed that stripped collective bargaining rights from most public unions. Indiana also passed a right-to-work law this year. While there have been moments of good news for organized labor, including pay bumps for GM autoworkers, industry analysts agree that organized labor no longer holds the sway it once did among America's workers. So why the downfall of American unions? That depends on who you ask. Blaming big business . Big businesses are behind campaigns to squelch organized labor, and they are seeing some success, according to Gordon Lafer, a political science professor and opponent of right-to-work laws. What right to work really means . ""The anti-union campaigns of the last three years, starting with Wisconsin, have really been driven ... by big national organizations and money,"" said Lafer, a union member and who teaches labor studies at the University of Oregon. ""I think an important question to think about is: Why are big private companies spending a lot of money and energy fighting public sector unions? ""They want more free trade, lower minimum wage, the right not to pay sick leave, and all those things which are not per se about union contracts. But the biggest single opponent they have is the labor movement, even in its shrunken and weaker state."" Lafer blames businesses and key business figures for lobbying to push such laws ""not because of what unions are doing now for their own members but to get them out of the way on issues that will affect everybody else."" These campaigns stigmatize unions and encourage people who are unemployed to resent unions rather than big business leaders, he argued. ""Their fear is populism,"" he said, referring to those who are ""at the top of the economy, during downward mobility."" ""They want the discontent to not be aimed at people running the economy."" There's also an element of fear among those who have jobs, he said. In this time of economic uncertainty, workers are afraid to organize because they don't want to upset their employers and lose their jobs. It's the economy . For businesses to recover from the recession and build jobs in America, they need to get out from under organized labor, according to some analysts. And that has led to the decline of union power -- which is good news, they say. ""Unions have lost power in the private sector over time because of competition, globalization, and the fact that they don't add any value to worker productivity,"" said Chris Edwards, an economist with the Cato Institute and a fan of right-to-work laws. Businesses are responding to today's realities and ""can't pay above-market wages forever,"" he said. ""So either they will move work abroad or they will automate to try to get rid of as many workers as they can."" Union membership by state . To build jobs in America, Edwards said businesses can't be beholden to mandatory collective bargaining, which can increase wages and expenses without increasing profits. In recent years, the retirement of baby boomers has fueled anti-union sentiment as some companies struggle to pay pensions as well as health care for the aging population -- benefits that were negotiated through collective bargaining. And, Edwards notes, that pressure comes on top of the economic downturn. Listen to how unions are bracing for a long battle . ""Unions are going the way of the dinosaur in the U.S. private sector, which is a good thing for workers and businesses because it will make America more competitive,"" he said. ""If right-to-work laws extend to the 50 states, then private sector unions will be dead in America."" How does Edwards feel about the death of all private sector unions? ""Good riddance,"" he said. Is it all about red vs. blue? The decline in union strength is also tied to the political battle between Democrats and Republicans. ""There has been a recognition by both the unions and people who are not happy with unions in the last 12 years or so that unions have been fundamentally the powerhouse between the Democratic party and their electoral math,"" said Linda Kaboolian, lecturer on public policy with Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Unions provide money and put ""boots on the ground"" to get Democratic candidates elected. If they shrink, so will the money and power of that central blue voting bloc, Kaboolian said, adding that ""it's a perfectly rational point of view"" for right-wing organizations to take. Union organizers did a great deal to push for President Barack Obama's re-election in key states, including Michigan. The president himself paid a visit to the state this week, voicing his opposition to the state's right-to-work measure. ""What we shouldn't do is take away your rights to bargain for better wages,"" Obama told workers. ""These so called right to work laws don't have to do with economics, they have to do with politics."" Kaboolian insisted that economic arguments for slicing union strength don't add up. Even if unionized workers cost more, they can often prove to be a higher-quality work force that will last, grow and learn new skills, she says. Kaboolian speaks of her own experience, having served as a union officer at the University of Michigan. She was also a manager and a worker in both unionized and non-unionized agencies. She said she does not advocate for or against right-to-work laws. James Sherk of the conservative Heritage Foundation rejected the idea that unions' decline are tied to American politics. He said the changes are being driven ""by efforts to attract business,"" not an underhanded political effort, he says. ""We're coming out of a pretty nasty recession ... Businesses understandably don't want to be unionized.""","Michigan is the latest 'Rust Belt' state to approve a right-to-work law .
It's the latest sign that organized labor's influence is waning in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- ""Slow and steady wins the race"" may be the moral of a children's tale, but the adage didn't hold up over the weekend in the case of Clark the tortoise vs. California police. The 150-pound tortoise decided to make a break for it in Alhambra, California, on Saturday. But he was no match for local police, who found the creature wandering the streets east of Los Angeles. ""Almost had a pursuit!"" the Alhambra Police Department wrote on its Facebook page. ""It took two officers to take this guy into custody,"" they explained -- because of the creature's weight. Handcuffs, they joked, weren't an option. In short order, police say, Clark was reunited with his family. Locals chimed in on Facebook, most celebrating Clark's safe return. One woman claimed she saw the tortoise while he was on the lam ""eating grass and leaves and moving at a fast clip."" Others made Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle jokes. But the Alhambra Police Department shut those down, writing that Clark ""did not respond to 'Michelangelo,' 'Leonardo,' 'Raphael,' or 'Donatello.'"" It's not the first time the police department has taken a walk on the wild side. The department encountered a man riding his horse through town on July 30. And on August 1, officers stopped another man who went for an evening jog in the nude. When officers asked the naked man what he was doing, they say, he told them he'd taken a pill and ""decided to go for a run."" Alhambra Police did not speculate whether drugs played a role in Clark's decision to lead them on a low-speed chase.

"(Mental Floss) -- Divorce is almost always a messy business, but certain settlements between former beloveds can be somewhat absurd. Here's a look at some examples of offbeat divorce settlements. 1. Now that's a breakup record . Marvin Gaye was a tremendous singer, but he wasn't always so great at keeping track of his personal finances. He spent lavishly, which meant that he often couldn't cover his bills. He was having particularly big trouble footing the bill for his 1977 divorce from Anna Gordy, so Gaye's lawyer worked out a novel settlement: Gaye would record a new album and give all of the royalties to Gordy as alimony. Gaye headed into the studio and recorded the double album ""Here, My Dear"" to fulfill this deal with Gordy. Unfortunately for Gordy, critics and audiences didn't love Gaye's divorce-themed concept album; although today's critics praise the album, it was the singer's worst charting record of the 1970s. 2. Don't hassle his attorney, either . As part of actor David Hasselhoff's 2008 divorce settlement with ex-wife Pamela Bach, he got to keep total possession of the nickname ""Hoff"" and the catchphrase ""Don't Hassle the Hoff."" Mental Floss: 6 David and Goliath trademark disputes . 3. If only divorce lawyers had their own Nobel . Nobel laureates may be some of the world's smartest people, but even they can bungle their divorce settlements. Take Robert Lucas, the 1995 winner of the economics prize. As part of his 1988 divorce settlement, his ex-wife got half of the funds from any future Nobel win, so when Lucas picked up the prize in 1995, he forked over half of the cash to his ex. Lucas must have been particularly irritated that the divorce settlement clause actually expired in 1995, so if he had nabbed the Nobel in 1996 he wouldn't have had to share his brainy booty. Lucas could at least take comfort in knowing he was in good company. All of Albert Einstein's prize money from his 1921 win in physics went to his ex-wife, Mileva Maric. 4. At least this is equitable . Cambodian couple Moeun Sarim and Vat Navy had been married for 18 years when they decided to part ways last year. Husband Moeun accused his wife of infidelity, so he decided to take the whole ""splitting everything 50-50"" concept to its logical conclusion. Moeun had his family come over and cut away half of the couple's 20' x 24' house. While his wife's half of the marital home remained standing, he deconstructed his own portion and carried the building supplies back to his parents' home. 5. Man really gets his wife's goat . Australian Steve Killeen managed to get his ex-wife's goat in their divorce. Literally. When Killeen and his wife split, he ended up with her pet goat, which he now takes for daily walks through Sydney. 6. Let us now divide any shared organs . Earlier this year, Long Island's Dr. Richard Batista made an odd request during his divorce: he wanted his allegedly unfaithful wife to return the kidney he'd given her. Dr. Batista gave his wife, Dawnell, a kidney in 2001, and as part of the messy divorce he claimed that he would either like the organ or compensation of $1.5 million. Legal scholars were skeptical of Batista's request given that a) organ donation is legally a gift, not a loan and b) losing her ex-husband's kidney would have been ruinous for Dawnell Batista's health. The court rejected Batista's claim earlier this year. Mental Floss: 11 body parts named after people . 7. Better than hotel soaps . When hotelier Conrad Hilton married the younger Hungarian actress and beauty queen Zsa Zsa Gabor in 1942, the union raised some eyebrows. Eventually, Gabor got tired of Hilton and began sleeping with her stepson, Nicky. Hilton and Gabor ended up divorcing in 1947, and she picked up $275,000 in the process. Gabor later joked, ""Conrad Hilton was very generous in the divorce settlement. He gave me 5,000 Gideon Bibles."" 8. Writer keeps his ex close . Prolific Belgian author Georges Simenon requested an odd stipulation in his 1949 divorce from his wife Tigy. Simenon's ex got a large alimony, one she later said was comparable to a top executive's salary during the 1950s, but she had to live no more than six miles away from Simenon so he could always see his children. 9. Peter Sellers' timing just a little off . In 1980, Peter Sellers was in the process of divorcing his fourth wife, Lynne Frederick, when he dropped dead from a sudden heart attack at the age of 54. Unfortunately for Sellers' children, their father hadn't gotten around to amending his will to reflect his cooling feelings for Frederick, and the divorce was not yet finalized. As a result, Frederick inherited Sellers' £4.5 million ($7.3 million) estate and the rights to all of his work, while the Sellers children got a meager £750 ($1,213) each. Within six months Frederick was married again, this time to celebrity journalist David Frost, but that union only lasted a year. Mental Floss: 13 bizarre stipulations in wills . 10. Charles and Diana's divorce Is a royal pain . When Prince Charles and Princess Diana divorced in 1996, there were all sorts of odd assets to divvy up. For starters, there was the issue of titles. Diana lost the right to be called ""Her Royal Highness,"" a move that peerage experts said was unprecedented. She did, however, retain the right to live in Kensington Palace, her jewelry, and the right to entertain at St. James's Palace with the Queen's permission. While Diana also picked up a financial settlement of $22.5 million, she lost a variety of honorary military titles as well. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"(CNN) -- Calling all ladies! The stunning landscapes of Arizona create the perfect spot for an adventurous girls vacation. No, I'm not suggesting you plot a ""Thelma & Louise""-type western getaway and wildly escape from your men and the police. Instead, relax with your favorite girlfriends (legally) and soak up the beauty of the mountainous landscape and all the experiences the area between Sedona's famous Red Rocks and the Grand Canyon has to offer. This spring, two girlfriends and I met in Phoenix to start our western road trip. Check out our itinerary, and use it as a guide for ideas on building your western trip. Phoenix to Grand Canyon (233 miles) We flew into Phoenix, but this wasn't a trip about big cities, so we high-tailed it out of the Valley of the Sun in our rented Nissan Rogue and drove 4½ hours north along Interstates 17 and 40 and Highway 64 toward the Grand Canyon. As we traveled along these scenic highways, the vegetation changed from saguaro cactuses to tall pine trees. The towering San Francisco peaks near Flagstaff were a highlight of the dramatic scenery along our route. The peaks are a volcanic mountain range and provide a number of recreational opportunities, from snow skiing to hiking. Grand Canyon . We arrived at the southern entrance to the Grand Canyon, just north of Tusayan, right before sunset and had our cameras ready. The park guides said Hopi and Yavapai points are some the best places to view a sunrise or sunset, and they didn't lead us astray. For dinner, we dined inside the park's Bright Angel Lodge (which is just a few feet from the canyon rim) at the Arizona Room. The restaurant specializes in hand-cut steaks, and fish and chicken inspired by flavors of the Southwest. One of its signature drinks is the Prickly Pear Margarita, which includes Hornitos Reposado tequila, prickly pear cactus syrup, lime, Triple Sec and sweet and sour mix. Both the food and drinks were excellent. We stayed outside the park, where rates are generally cheaper, but we admired El Tovar Hotel, the park's priciest and most famous lodge. Built in 1905, famous guests over the years have included Theodore Roosevelt, Bill Clinton and Paul McCartney, to name a few. The hotel was also featured in the 1983 Chevy Chase film ""National Lampoon's Vacation."" The following morning, we met our tour bus outside the Bright Angel Lodge for a guided view of the national park. (We used the Grand Canyon's official website to find our tour operator.) Our bus ride covered 52 miles in a little under four hours as we traveled east from the lodge along the rim of the canyon. The tour stopped at Lipan Point, touted as the most scenic viewpoint on the East Rim drive. The  Watchtower, designed in the 1930s by famed architect Mary Colter in the style of the ancestral Puebloan people, also offered stunning -- even soul-enriching -- views of the canyon. The Grand Canyon offers endless opportunities for exploration, beyond what we discovered during our 24-hour visit. Thousands of visitors each year hike the park's various trails, bike along the Greenway trail and paved roads, enjoy airplane and helicopter tours, and brave rafting trips and mule rides. Grand Canyon to Sedona (119 miles): . The diverse landscape during our southbound road trip between the Grand Canyon's South Rim and Sedona kept us busy with our cameras. In  Coconino National Forest, the scenery ranges from deserts and ponderosa pine forests to volcanic peaks. Elevation in Coconino ranges from 2,600 feet to 12,633 feet at the summit of Humphreys Peak. A snowstorm caught us during a small portion of the drive, but we ended the journey with sunny skies in Sedona. I'd never seen such extreme climate changes in a 120-mile trip until this excursion. Sedona area . Sedona's main attraction is no doubt its stunning array of red sandstone formations, enveloped in the area's celebrated spiritual energy. The Red Rocks provided a truly awe-inspiring backdrop for our outdoor adventures. But first, shopping -- naturally a part of many girls trips, and ours was no exception. Sedona is filled with art galleries, boutiques, New Age metaphysical shops, antiques and even an outdoor shopping mall. Be sure to pick up made-in-Sedona cactus jellies, Native American crafts or even healing gemstones during your visit. A skeptic finds inner peace in Sedona . Our first big adventure (beyond shopping) was a two-hour off-road tour in an open-air Jeep. Our professional driver, who doubled as an informative tour guide, showed us geologic formations and some of the trademark Red Rock formations. There are numerous outfitters who provide Jeep tours, and prices vary, depending on the type of excursion you select. We decided to bundle our Jeep tour with a 1½-hour horseback riding trip near the banks of the Verde River in Cottonwood, Arizona. During our horseback riding adventure, in a place ironically called Dead Horse Ranch State Park (none of our horses died on this trip, by the way!), we rode under cottonwood and sycamore trees and enjoyed the panoramic views of Mingus Mountain. We finished our excursion with a picnic lunch near the horse arena, which was included in the tour package. Back at our hotel in Sedona, we hopped into our trusty rental car and wandered to an amazing piece of architecture -- the Chapel of the Holy Cross. From some angles, the chapel looks as though it's rising from Sedona's famed rock formations, and many comment that the structure has ""universal appeal"" because of its unique design. Construction of the chapel was completed in 1956 to wide acclaim, and it was designed by Marguerite Brunswig Staude, a former student of legendary architect Frank Lloyd Wright. And while we didn't necessarily find religion during our visit, we fantasized what it might be like to get married in this church. But that will remain a fantasy, since the chapel doesn't perform wedding ceremonies. A skeptic finds inner peace in Sedona . We finished our day with a visit to the spa, since Sedona is known for its spa treatments. (As are many girls trips!) I selected a package called New Beginnings, where I received a psychic reading, followed by a one-hour massage. The reading was marketed as a way for ""clearing the old and expanding the new energies inside of me."" We felt refreshed from our treatments and walked away from the experience more relaxed than when we first started. I'm not sure if I bought into the psychic reading, but it was interesting to hear what my future may hold. Day trips from Sedona . The area around Sedona is rich in Old West and Native American culture and history. During our visit, we hopped into our rental car and explored some nearby cliff dwellings, including Montezuma Castle and the Palatki Ruins. These ruins of cliff dwellings (plus many more we didn't have time to visit) stand as a monument to the ingenuity of the ancient people who built them hundreds of years ago. Trips to both locations were about a 25-minute drive from our Sedona hotel. Another highlight of the trip was a visit to Jerome, Arizona, a historic copper mining town that has transformed itself into a quaint tourist town filled with shops and eateries. We enjoyed a mouth-watering lunch at the Haunted Hamburger restaurant, which we're told is a favorite among locals for its juicy, thick burgers. We capped our trip with a visit to a winery region along North Page Springs Road, about 15 miles south of Sedona. (We had a designated driver!) Wine producers say cool nights and mild winters make ideal growing conditions for reds like merlot and cabernet. It was a perfect (and tasty) ending to a fabulous girls trip.","Arizona provided a perfect backdrop for the author's girls trip .

"(CNN) -- In the third grade, Marlon Gibson was so overweight his mom had to take him to the men's store to buy his Easter suit. ""Even back then, I absolutely loved clothes,"" Gibson said. ""That's what really keeps me honest with all this weight loss. I want to go to the mall to buy more than socks."" At his heaviest he weighed 405 pounds. Now the 5-foot-11-inch associate director of student conduct at Emory University in Atlanta weighs 160 pounds. Since January 2011, he's lost 245 pounds, or the equivalent of a gas stove. He says anyone can do it his way: without surgery or a special diet program . ""I always tell people it's the three p's: persistence, passion and perseverance,"" Gibson said. The turning point came when the 34-year-old watched his wife tear up during ""The Biggest Loser."" ""She told me she loved me, but she worried that I wasn't going to be around long because of my weight,"" Gibson said. ""I had to do something."" Gibson had been heavy all his life. Growing up, none of the adults in his family ever talked to him about healthy eating. They didn't have to, he says. ""My mom used to joke my dad would get kicked out of buffets, he had such a great appetite and such a great metabolism. He never had to work to be small,"" Gibson said. ""My mom was never bigger than a size 6."" His mom tried to set a good example with daily exercise. ""She was the person who got up and did her Jane Fonda video every morning,"" Gibson said. But he was an only child, and everyone in his family showed their love with food. His grandmother, especially, doted on him. ""She would take me to McDonald's nearly every day,"" Gibson said. ""I did love a big cheeseburger and fries, and I never met a sweet I didn't like."" He wasn't much into sports or exercising either. ""I never learned to swim at camp because I'd get ear aches,"" Gibson said. ""I remember playing kickball in second grade and broke my pinky finger. And from there on out, when they'd ask me to play, I'd say, 'Nope, I'm good.'"" As he steadily gained weight, Gibson said he was lucky that the kids didn't bully him about it. ""I've always had a great sense of humor and can deflect the attention from my being obese,"" Gibson said. That sense of humor also got him in trouble. While attending an all-boys Catholic school in Ohio known for its orderly discipline, he served a lot of time in detention. But being the class clown also paid off with fast friendships. ""I'm lucky; people have always been nice, or at least they try to be,"" Gibson said. ""People would often give me a back-handed compliment like 'you're handsome for a fat kid.'"" He met his wife, Sheree, at a fraternity function in 2004. They were in graduate school at the time. They married two years later. Soon after he watched her tear up over ""The Biggest Loser,"" he cut himself trying to force a zipper closed on a pair of pants that were too tight. That's when he finally decided he had enough. He had to lose weight, and he wanted to do it in a way that would stick. Rather than cut out all bad food, he gradually reduced the amount he was eating. ""I loved fried chicken, so I decided I would eat six pieces instead of eight,"" Gibson said. ""Then I'd reduce it further to four pieces, and then eventually dropped fried chicken all together. I ate meat more like it was a protein condiment. Now I don't eat any meat at all. I'm a dedicated vegan."" Gibson said he is ""hyper vigilant"" about what he eats now. He'll start the day with a protein shake before he heads off to the gym in the morning. After he works out, he eats oatmeal with apple slices. Lunch is vegetarian chili with a salad and more vegetables such as Brussels sprouts, broccoli or corn on the cob. Dinner is often popcorn, with an occasional smoothie for dessert. ""By now this kind of eating is a habit -- so much so that when I went to visit a friend in Iowa, I packed my popcorn and chili and ate it on my layover in Chicago,"" Gibson said. He breaks from routine every once in awhile, though. ""In May I turned 34 and decided to splurge,"" Gibson said. ""We went to a vegan bakery and got a slice of the hummingbird cake, which we split. I hadn't had cake since 2010."" Gibson also exercises daily. ""Spinning is my favorite. I like to do two 70-minute spin classes back-to-back,"" Gibson said. He also runs at least 3 miles in the evening and does crunches and push-ups before bed. Gibson stays focused with the help of a coach, Ryan Blanck, CEO of offtrackonpurpose.com. Blanck lives in North Carolina, so all their sessions are virtual. Gibson finds their sessions particularly effective. ""He gives me positive encouragement and tough love. I remember one time he said, 'Your motivation isn't where it once was.' That's all I needed to hear. When I went to the gym that day I told my wife drop me off further away -- I need the walk."" This healthy living has paid off. In addition to the weight loss, Gibson no longer needs high blood pressure medicine. He says he's ""got energy for days."" He also loves to motivate others and talks about his weight loss at church and helps friends. ""This weight loss has transformed my life,"" Gibson said. ""It's totally possible. You just have to hold yourself accountable."" Have you lost weight? Share your story on iReport .","Marlon Gibson weighed 405 pounds at his heaviest .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China's top legislature approved resolutions to officially amend its controversial one-child policy and end re-education through labor camps. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed the resolutions Saturday, according to the Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency. The resolution is equal to a legal document in China. The changes to the one-child policy, first announced last month, will mean couples will be allowed to have two children if one of the parents was an only child, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. Currently, both parents must be sole children to be eligible for a second child. The one-child policy, which started in the 1970s, is believed to have prevented some 400 million births, according to Xinhua. Although the policy has been applauded by many for slowing down China's rapid population growth, it has also been widely criticized for resulting in forced abortions and hefty fines for families. Some critics say the law hurts China's elderly, who typically rely on their children for support in old age, and even constrains economic growth as the working-age population begins to decline. Since the 1990s, the birth rate has declined, with Chinese women giving birth to an average of 1.4 to 1.6 children. Officials say the easing of the one-child policy does not mean China is ending its family planning. ""China still has a large population. This has not changed. Many of our economic and social problems are rooted in this reality,"" said Jiang Fan, an National People's Congress deputy and member of the NPC Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee, in Chinese media. ""We cannot risk the population growing out of control."" The easing of the one-child policy is expected to go into effect in some regions in the first quarter of 2014, according to Xinhua. Re-education camps abolished . China had hinted as early as January that it would terminate the controversial re-education through labor camps. The notorious camps date back to the 1950s when the new Communist regime sought to silence its enemies to consolidate its power. Critics say the camps, which fall outside of the formal prison system, are often misused to persecute government dissidents, including intellectuals, human rights activists and followers of banned spiritual groups like the Falun Gong. China's forced labor camps: One woman's fight for justice . The abolition of labor camps called ""laojiao"" goes into effect Saturday. Xinhua reported that the people still serving in re-education through labor camps will be set free. Human rights organizations say the changes to the labor camps may just be cosmetic. Amnesty International told CNN earlier this month that the labor camps are being replaced by other types of facilities such as ""legal education camps"" or renamed as drug rehabilitation camps.

"(CNN) -- From the air, the 99 islands of Hallyeohaesang National Marine Park look like patches of moss on a blue carpet. Only 30 of them are inhabited, and a boat ride through the islands show glimpses of sleepy shoreline villages and bays dotted with fishing boats. In the heart of the 545-square-kilometer park, off the main tourist route, is an island shaped like a barbell, called Bijindo. Bijindo has a unique geographical feature -- a powdery white strip of sand tethering two ends of the island together. Locals call the island Miindo, which means ""beautiful island."" Different universe . On Bijindo, time seems to stop. There's a single road on the island -- it connects the two villages of Waehang and Naehang -- but not a car in sight. Older villagers rest beneath the shade of trees while dogs walk by without care. Small waves break against a beautiful empty beach. Island life . Time on the island is simple. Visitors relax on the beach. Hike a few trails. Try out some of the best fishing in the country. Other than that, the most popular thing to do is watch the sun rise and set over the islands. Lee Jeong Mi, of the Tongyeong Tourist Information Center, considers off the beaten track islands like Bijindo to be national treasures. ""It's the best way to experience real island life,"" she says. ""The view from the islands is also different from other places in Korea. ""On most islands you look out over the sea at an open horizon. It's an almost lonely feeling. But here, the islands in the marine park are so close together that they almost seem like friends."" More travel spots . Travelers is often passe by Bijindo in favor of more popular islands in the marine park. Somaemuldo and Deungdaeseom islands feature spiking rock formations and cliffs. Yeonhwado is known as the Buddhist island -- its temple is a pilgrimage site for devout Buddhists. Another island worth seeing is Hansando, which houses a shrine devoted to one of Korea's most venerated naval commanders, Yi Sun Shin. It was near here that in 1592 Admiral Yi and his troops won the decisive Battle of Hansando against attacking Japanese. Yi used special ships akin to floating tanks, known as dragon boats or turtle ships, that were covered with spiked iron plates. Each had a large wooden dragon's head at the bow. Island hopping . The ferry terminal to get to the Hallyeohaesang Park islands is located in Tongyeong, a city full of cultural sites, making it a good place to spend time in before or after the islands. The Tongyeong International Music Festival takes place every March. In August, the city celebrates the Great Battle of Hansan Festival with a street parade. Fresh seafood is a huge draw. Where to stay . Accommodations are humble, to say the least. In Tongyeong, the Napole Motel is right on the harbor and next to the city's most famous seafood market. Napoli Motel, Tongyong-si, Dongho-dong 160; +82 55 646 0202; from ₩70,000 ($62) peak season, ₩40,000 ($36) low season . On Bijindo, Bada Iyagi Pension sits right on the beach. Each room has a small terrace overlooking the water. Camping is allowed on the beach but campfires are not. Bijindo Bada Iyagi, Bijin-ri, Wayhang; +82 55 642 6171; from ₩170,000 ($151) peak season, ₩80,000 ($71) low season . Where to eat . There aren't many places to eat on Bijindo. The island is just too small. Most visitors bring their own food and cook where they're staying -- most rooms on the island have a small kitchen or barbecue pits. One restaurant that stands out is Bijin Sikdang, which serves a good Haemul Dwenjang Jigae (seafood soybean stew) for ₩10,000 ($9). Bijin Sikdang, Bijin-ri, Wayhang; +82 55 642 9704 . In Tongyong, which is known for seafood, the Jungang Live Fish Market is the epicenter for eating anything that comes from the ocean. Vendors sell live fish in plastic tubs. Point to one and the fishmonger will cut it up and send it to one of the restaurants in the market where you can have it prepared for you. It's like a raw fish festival every day. The city of Tongyong lends its ancient name to a popular dish, Chung Mu gimbap. All around the market, small restaurants serve Chung Mu gimbap, rice rolled in laver (algae) and served with squid pickled in hot red pepper. Oysters are another local favorite. Daepungwan restaurant offers an unforgettable oyster medley. The B Course (₩17,000/$15 per person) includes oyster bibimbap, guljun (fried oyster pancake and gul tangsuyuk) and deep-fried oysters in sweet and sour sauce.

"(CNN) -- When faced with a home full of his estranged wife's relatives, police say, Ronald Lee Haskell opened fire. When faced with a judge, he collapsed. The episode Friday in a Texas courtroom reportedly came during a reading of the six capital murder charges facing the 33-year-old suspect. Two law enforcement officials held Haskell for 20 about seconds before sitting him on the floor. They then put him in a desk chair and wheeled him out of the courtroom. Yet Haskell returned -- in time for the judge to set his arraignment for August 14. Then, he will likely hear the murder charges again, for the four children and two adults he allegedly fatally gunned down. It's hard to comprehend the extent of the bloodshed or the apparent horror of the scene. Yet reports suggest that people close to him felt threatened by him well before the mass murder in Texas this week. Even his own mother. Father of victim: Survivor called 911, likely 'saved all of our lives' According to the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, Karla Haskell and her son got into an argument July 2 at the home they shared in San Marcos, California. As she attempted to leave and call for help, ""Ronald physically restrained her and prevented her from leaving,"" a news release from the department said. After her daughter returned home to find her -- which happened around 8 p.m., hours after the incident began -- Karla Haskell relayed her story to a sheriff's deputy. And, at the deputy's recommendation, she obtained a temporary restraining order against her son. Meanwhile, the California sheriff's department deputies began looking for Ronald Lee Haskell or his truck. They didn't find either. In fact, authorities didn't catch up with him until exactly one week later. That came after a three-hour standoff in Texas, at the end of which Ronald Lee Haskell was taken into custody. By then, the full, gory details of what authorities say he did had become painfully clear. Texas authorities said Haskell entered a Spring, Texas, home demanding to know the whereabouts of his estranged wife, Melannie Haskel. She was not there, but that didn't stop him from killing -- according to the Harris County Sheriff's Office -- Stephen Stay, 39; Katie Stay, 33; two boys, ages 13 and 4; and two girls, ages 9 and 7. Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Ron Hickman said a victim called to notify police ""of the location that she believed that he may go from there."" There was only one person -- a 15-year-old girl -- who survived the attack; authorities indicated she was critically wounded, though a relative later said she should make a full recovery. Roger Lyon, father of Katie Stay, credited that teenager for ""her bravery and courage in calling 911, an act that is likely to have saved all of our lives. ""She is our hero."" Estranged wife accused Haskell of dragging, hitting her . Karla Haskell wasn't the only person who had sought protection against Ronald Lee Haskell. So, too, did his estranged wife, Melannie. Police in Logan City, Utah, said Thursday that officers responded to a domestic violence complaint in June 2008 in which Melannie Haskell accused her husband of dragging her by the hair and hitting her in the head in front of their children. Ronald Haskell was subsequently charged with domestic assault and domestic violence in the presence of a child. Those charges were eventually dropped after a plea deal was reached. Utah police said Melannie Haskell in August of 2013 reported a protective order violation in which she alleged Ronald Haskell threatened her and her lawyer. She alleged another such violation that October, saying that he had shown up at one of their children's elementary schools. As police noted, ""neither protective order violation was prosecuted.""

"(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania woman charged in the November slaying of a man she and her husband met through Craigslist has told a newspaper that she killed many more victims, and authorities told CNN Sunday they are investigating the woman's shocking claims. A law enforcement source close to the investigation said Miranda Barbour's new claims could be ""the real deal."" ""It's conceivable,"" the source said, who did not want to be identified because of the ongoing investigation. From prison on Friday, the 19-year-old Barbour told a reporter for the Daily Item in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, that she participated in at least 22 killings in the past six years in Alaska, Texas, North Carolina and California. ""When I hit 22, I stopped counting,"" Barbour is quoted as saying in a phone interview from Northumberland County Prison on Friday night. ""I can pinpoint on a map where you can find them."" Sunbury Police Chief Steve Mazzeo told CNN that investigators have been in contact with the FBI and law enforcement in some of the states where Barbour has lived. Police: Newlyweds lure man through Craigslist for thrill killing . ""We investigate all leads just because that's the proper protocol to follow through,"" Mazzeo added. The FBI said it's too early to say what its involvement may be in the case. ""The FBI's Philadelphia Division has recently been in contact with the Sunbury Police Department regarding Miranda Barbour, and will offer any assistance requested in the case,"" it said in a statement to CNN. Barbour told the newspaper she had her first experience with killing when she just 13, shortly after she said she joined a satanic cult in Alaska. Authorities are looking closely at Barbour's claims that she was involved in Satanism, according to another law enforcement source close to the investigation. Public defender Edward Greco, who is representing Barbour, told CNN he was not aware that his client was planning to give the interview. Barbour requested the interview that was recorded on audio at the Northumberland County Prison, according to the Daily Item. The reporter, Francis Scarcella, told CNN he was not allowed to bring in a notepad or any other recording device. He said police allowed him to listen to the interview after it was conducted. ""I feel it is time to get all of this out. I don't care if people believe me. I just want to get it out,"" Barbour is quoted as saying. Greco would not comment on the accuracy of Barbour's claims. Investigators believe Barbour had Craigslist encounters with at least 30 men, according to a source close to the investigation. Police are trying to find those men, the source said. The father of Barbour's 1-year-old child is deceased. Sunbury police have said his death is part of their investigation. Greco says the Craigslist case is still moving forward, and a trial date has not been set. Barbour and her husband, Elytte Barbour, 22, face several charges including criminal homicide in that case. Both have pleaded not guilty. The Barbours are accused of luring Troy LaFerrara, 42, through a ""companionship"" ad on Craigslist, and stabbing and strangling him to death on November 11, 2013. The couple, married for only three weeks at the time of the slaying, just wanted to kill someone together, police said. They moved from North Carolina to Pennsylvania after they tied the knot. Elytte Barbour told police at the time that he and his wife had tried to kill others, but the plans didn't work out. ""I remember everything,"" she told the Daily Item, adding the November killing was the couple's first. ""It is like watching a movie."" After connecting on Craigslist and agreeing to have sex for $100, according to her interview with the Daily Item, Miranda Barbour met LaFerrara at a mall parking lot and drove to Sunbury. She stabbed LaFerrara 20 times with a knife in the front seat of her red Honda CR-V while her husband tied a cable cord around his neck, police said. LaFerrara's body was found in the backyard of a home in Sunbury, a small city about 100 miles northwest of Philadelphia, on November 12. The last number dialed on his cell phone led police to the Barbours, according to authorities. Miranda Barbour told the Daily Item that she felt no remorse for her victims and said she killed only ""bad people."" ""If I were to be released, I would do this again,"" Barbour is quoted as saying.

"(CNN) -- Barring a surprise, the next big round of Apple announcements are coming June 2. The company has announced the dates for its next Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), an annual event where Apple gives the press and developers a peek at its latest projects. Because it's a conference for application developers, the big unveilings tend to focus on operating systems and software, so don't bet on any major iPhone or iPad announcements. Desktop and laptop lines may get a refresh at the event, however. Last year, Apple announced the latest version of its desktop operating system, OS X Mavericks, and a heavily redesigned update to the mobile operating system, iOS 7. They also gave us the first peek at the cylindrical Mac Pro. This year Apple will likely preview iOS 8, the updated operating system for iPhones and iPads. One rumored new feature is Healthbook, a hub for health and fitness apps that take advantage of all the sensors packed into the mobile devices. There's also good chance we'll get an update to OS X, following up Mavericks with a new Mac operating system, 10.10. Apple could also update the MacBook, iMac and MacBook Air with new, faster processors. The MacBook Air might finally get ""retina display,"" Apple's term for its high-res screens. The long rumored iWatch could also make its debut at this event, although that seems unlikely. But Apple is notoriously secretive and might still be able to slip in a few surprises. WWDC lasts five days, running from June 2 to 6. For consumers, the real action happens during the opening keynote when CEO Tim Cook and select Apple executives take the stage to give a choreographed pep talk and demonstration of new products. After the splashy news announcements, developers from around the world attend sessions, classes and talks to learn the nitty-gritty details of creating programs for the various operating systems. They get one-on-one time with Apple engineers and work hands-on with the new platforms. It's also a huge networking event, peppered with meet-ups, open bars and parties. Apple says 1,000 Apple engineers and 5,000 developers attend WWDC. Most of the major tech companies with platforms host annual developers conferences. In addition to getting free news coverage, the companies can make tidy amounts of money on the events. WWDC costs $1,599 to attend, while this week's Microsoft Build lasts three days and costs $2,095, and Google I/O is three days and $900. And on April 30, Facebook is bringing back its one-day F8 developer conference after a hiatus.","Apple's annual developers conference will take place June 2-6 in San Francisco .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- On September 1, 2012, an adult inmate was attacked at Baldwin State Prison in Hardwick, Georgia. He had a sense of what was coming so he ran to a dorm entrance and screamed for help. Help didn't come. Other inmates dragged the man to a bathroom where he was stomped, kicked and punched. They tied his hands and poured scalding water on his groin and thigh. They forced a broomstick up his rectum. Eventually, his assailants let him go, which -- amazingly -- puts that inmate in the lucky category. Lucky to be alive. Thirty-three prisoners and one officer have been killed by other prisoners in Georgia since 2010, according to a report released Wednesday by the Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta. The report details the attack on that inmate, and other attacks on other prisoners, and calls for the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate. It says the Georgia Department of Corrections (GDC) has failed. Calls to the Georgia department were not immediately returned Wednesday. ""People who are supposed to be running our prisons have lost control,"" said Sarah Geraghty, senior attorney at the Southern Center for Human Rights. ""It appears they either cannot or will not take appropriate steps to address the level of violence."" 'Violent prisons teach and breed violence' The violence is staggering and, according to the center's report, becoming more and more brutal. In January, a prisoner at Coffee Correctional Facility in Nicholls, Georgia, suffered third-degree burns after boiling water was poured on his face and genitals, and bleach was poured into his eyes. In February, a prisoner had three fingers severed by a man with a 19-inch knife at Wilcox State Prison in Abbeville, Georgia. And just this week, an inmate at Augusta State Medical Prison in Grovetown, Georgia, died after being stabbed. The problem, Geraghty said, is multidimensional. One, prisoners have access to lethal weapons. Two, supervision and protective custody procedures are inadequate. Three, locks on some cell doors have been broken -- and left that way for years. And on, and on and on. ""It has reached a point where nearly every day we receive calls or letters from someone who was assaulted or stabbed or beaten or raped in our state prisons,"" Geraghty said, stressing that inmates aren't the only ones in danger. The conditions pose significant risk to correctional officers and to the public as well. Last year, some 21,000 men and women were released from Georgia prisons, according to the report. ""Prisons are supposed to provide rehabilitation. But violent prisons teach and breed violence,"" it reads. Federal report finds Alabama prison 'toxic,' female inmates abused . What could happen next? A request for comment to the Department of Justice was not immediately returned Wednesday. Besides launching an investigation, the department could recommend changes and pursue litigation. It's done so before in a number of cases. The report highlights three Georgia prisons as particularly dangerous: Baldwin State Prison, Hays State Prison and Smith State Prison. Twenty-one percent of the 33 homicides of Georgia prisoners since 2010 took place at Smith State Prison, located in Glennville, Georgia, according to the Southern Center for Human Rights. But Geraghty is not asking the Justice Department to look at specific prisons; she wants it to investigate the system as a whole. The center says three times as many prisoners were killed in Georgia in 2012, as compared to 10 years ago, and that in that one year, Georgia had more homicides in its state prisons than some other states' prisons had in the last 10 years. For context, between 2001-2011, there were 31 state prisoner deaths by homicide reported in Georgia, nine in Alabama, 21 in South Carolina, 44 in Florida, eight in Pennsylvania, seven in Mississippi and 142 in California, the nation's most populous state, according to Justice Department statistics. ""The U.S. Department of Justice should launch a thorough investigation,"" reads the center's report. ""It is not possible to stop all violence in prison. But the frequency and severity of violent incidents that are now occurring in Georgia's prisons do not happen in a well-run system."" Texas inmates sue over lack of air conditioning .

"London (CNN) -- Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger poked fun at the Monty Python stars on Monday ahead of the comedy troupe's reunion concerts this week as ""a bunch of wrinkly old men trying to relive their youth and make a load of money."" Appearing in a video shown at the Monty Python Live (mostly) news conference at a central London theater, Jagger is asked by his assistant if he wants tickets for the shows. The singer, who is watching the World Cup football on TV with bandmate Charlie Watts, replies: ""Who wants to see that again? It was funny in the 60s."" He adds: ""The best one died years ago. Maybe back in the 70s it was fantastic -- it was the funniest thing. We've seen it all before. I mean they've put it all up on YouTube."" Jagger's assistant then runs through the playlist for the next Stones concert: ""Start with something everyone knows like 'Let's Spend The Night Together,' then 'Get Off My Cloud,' then hit 'Satisfaction.'"" His assistant then suggests: ""Dead Parrot Sketch."" To which, Jagger replies, straight-faced: ""Yeah, 'Dead Parrot Sketch.'"" The five surviving members of Monty Python -- Graham Chapman died in 1989 -- will perform together live for the first time since 1980 this week, putting on 10 shows at the O2 arena in southeast London. The first shows sold out in a matter of minutes when they were announced last November, and tickets for extra performances will go on sale on Tuesday morning. The comedians say the extravagantly choreographed performances will be their last. The very last show, on July 20, will be broadcast live in more than 2,000 cinemas around the world, and on TV. At Monday's news conference, however, the stars -- all now in their 70s -- joked that they would reform every 33 years. Python member Eric Idle, who is directing the shows, said they would perform many of of their best-known sketches such as the ""Lumberjack Song,"" ""Dead Parrot"" and ""The ""Spanish Inquisition,"" as well as new material. ""Our motto has been 'leave them wanting less,'"" he joked. Echoing Jagger's comments in the preceding film clip, Idle agreed there were similarities between pop bands reforming and themselves. ""(The fans) want to hear 'Let's Spend The Night Together,'"" Idle said. ""So it would be folly to try to write better things than our best old work."" Michael Palin said the final live shows were taking place in England, ""where it started,"" and is part of ""saying goodbye publicly"" to fans. Idle added that, the day before the run opens, there was a ""weight of expectation"" on their shoulders. The Pythons admitted they had reunited mainly for the money, but said they were enjoying working together again. And with ""nothing more to be done"" to prepare for the shows, the mood now was one of excitement, he added. Idle, Chapman, Palin, Terry Gilliam, John Cleese and Terry Jones became comedic legends with the creation of Monty Python's Flying Circus in October 1969. They produced 45 TV episodes for the BBC and five films together before going their separate ways in 1983. The shows mostly consisted of a string of often incoherent sketches, only occasionally with conventional punchlines and loosely tied together by Gilliam's stream-of-consciousness animations. Although the TV show ran for only four seasons, it proved a massive cult hit when it was shown in the United States beginning in 1974 -- just as the show was winding up on the other side of the Atlantic.","Mick Jagger pokes fun at Monty Python stars before this week's reunion tour begins .

"(CNN) -- An Arizona mayor is comparing a Border Patrol proposal to put razor wire on portions of the U.S.-Mexico border fence to building the Berlin Wall. ""We've had a black eye because everybody is using the border as a political issue,"" Nogales Mayor Arturo Garino said. The proposal, according to Garino, would put concertina wire on top of the 20-foot-high fence to the east and west of town. ""Tucson Sector Border Patrol is considering a proposed deployment of concertina wire in the Nogales area,"" Border Patrol spokesman Brent Cagen wrote in an e-mail. ""Currently this proposal is still under review. Specifics concerning this proposal are unavailable at this time."" Should the U.S. be more like Mexico? Nogales is a major trade hub on the border, abutting the Mexican state of Sonora. It is considered part of the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector, which consists of 262 miles stretching from the Arizona-New Mexico border to Yuma County, near Lukeville. Garino, a former law enforcement officer and member of the Southwest Border Task Force, praised the Border Patrol for the ""tremendous"" decrease in drug and human trafficking in southern Arizona. But he said that adding razor wire will negatively affect international trade. ""I strongly believe we don't need it,"" he said. ""It's an eyesore. It's a dangerous thing. We need to build relations with Sonora and Mexico. Let's become a power in the world economy."" Victor Brabble, public affairs manager for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said Garino's concerns will be taken into account before a final decision is made. ""We are consulting with community leaders to evaluate the economic, environmental, political, and social implications our proposals may have on the communities we serve,"" he wrote in an e-mail. House GOP split over immigration reform . Nogales City Councilman John Doyle, a Nogales native, echoed Garino's opposition to the proposal and said he was shocked to learn about it. ""We've always been the home of the brave, and now we are living in fear,"" he said. Nogales officials will meet with Homeland Security personnel this week to continue reviewing the proposal, which is being considered as a deterrent to would-be illegal crossers, Garino said. ""Right now, it's a proposal,"" he said. ""But if somebody says 'yes,' it's going up."" Garino also grew up in Nogales and said he thinks the best deterrent is increased manpower. Agents should be reassigned from checkpoints and interior bases to the border, he said. ""Bring the Border Patrol to the border and have them do their jobs.""

"(CNN) -- Is it OK to not like Fenway Park? Can you say so without sounding as if you're the kind of guy who would love to break in and trash Buckingham Palace, the Louvre, the Vatican, the Taj Mahal, Graceland, Disneyland and Hogwarts? Is there anyone from New England who would go, hmmm, maybe you're right? Or would everyone there like to see you sentenced to 20 years in Shawshank for insulting Boston's baseball park, which in that corner of America is considered a hate crime? Samuel L. Clemens (no relation to Roger), aka Mark Twain (a plain-talkin' Midwestern indigene like myself), once wrote of a certain Massachusetts metropolis: ""One of the most engaging peculiarities of Boston is her reverence for her traditions, her relics, her antiquities."" He was referring to her Massacre, not her ballpark, but I think he really nailed her. Twain died on April 21, 1910, in Connecticut, as good a place to get sick and kick a bucket as any. (A great many insurance agents there.) Two years later, damn near to the day, a new Boston place of business opened its gates to the public. April 20, 1912, turned out to be a big day in that city's history, even if most of the folks from the Fenway district 100 years ago were still talking about a big tub in the Atlantic that went down with poor Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet on it. I am pleased to acknowledge that Fenway Park's centennial is upon us. I am less pleased to confess that -- at the risk of offending any Red Sox fan who feels as if you have just spat on his or her great-grandfather's grave -- what I love about Fenway is, to be perfectly frank with you, nothing. If you love it, love every single thing about it, good for you. I am very sorry, but not all of us do. All right, now here comes the disclaimer where I give you a lot of yada-yada about how much I do like the city of Boston itself, the community, the Commons, heck, the whole Commonwealth, and have never in my life spent a bad hour there. I have no grudge against the Red Sox in any way, shape or form. I am not a Yankees guy. I have admired the pride of New England folk ever since Hester Prynne took a high hard one, oh about letter-high. I have long liked Sweet Baby James and Marvelous Marvin and Tip and Yaz and Eck and El Tiante and Oil Can and Big Papi and the Pops and the Pats. I even thought for a few years that ""Boston Legal"" was the best show on TV. If I belabor this point, it is out of self-preservation. SI: A lyric to the little bandbox . I am no Boston basher by nature and have no desire to be branded as one. I was a ChiSox child, but liked the BoSox just fine. The first game Dad took me to was Sox vs. Sox, and darned if Ted Williams didn't wallop a home run. So did the pitcher, a guy named Jerry Casale whom I never laid eyes on thereafter. To earn a living (if you can call it that), I got a newspaper job. I have been to Fenway a couple dozen times. I saw Pudge behind the plate and Dwight in right. I interviewed Dom DiMaggio once. I interviewed Ted's kid, the one who deep-froze him. I became a Hall of Fame voter who did not vote for Jim Rice. I didn't care much for Bill Buckner, so I didn't much care when that ball went through his legs. I was in St. Louis on the 2004 night when the Red Sox took the World Series to reverse the Bambino curse. I wrote about Harry Frazee selling Babe Ruth to New York for $100,000 so he could back a show called ""No, No, Nanette."" I promptly got a note from Harry Frazee III, saying no, no, that was a big fat lie because his grandfather did no such thing. ""His theater money went into baseball,"" I was told. When the park first went up, Bostonians undoubtedly felt like Kubla Khan must have when a stately pleasure-dome he did decree. For 1912, Fenway Park must have been such an architectural marvel, you'd think Howard Roark of ""Fountainhead"" fame designed it. I am sure the washrooms had indoor plumbing and everything modern. The seats in the grandstand were so large, they could comfortably accommodate men as large as 5-foot-5. Little did they know that come April 20, 2012, there would be all kinds of wild changes in the world, like a manned spaceship to the moon, a black man in the White House and a woman maybe even being considered for membership at Augusta National. I applaud the fact that the cute bandbox at 4 Yawkey Way, Boston, 02215 is now the oldest venue for a professional athletic team in these United States. It is in the news for turning 100. Willard Scott and Smuckers will no doubt salute it. It is also in the news becase of an outspoken, outlandish, outstanding (choose one) opinion expressed by a young fellow by the name of Luke Scott, a designated hitter (one of those post-1912 things) for the Tampa Bay Rays (ditto), who had the temerity to say of Fenway Park: ""As a baseball player, going there to work, it's a dump."" Whoa, did his spit hit the fans. You'd have thought he compared Fenway to the quake-struck Fukushima Daiichi nuke plant. You know, in a keep-out, run-for-your-lives kind of way. I grant you that it didn't help the kid's popularity any that Scott went on to say of Fenway's fans that ""they're ruthless, they're vulgar, they cause trouble, they talk about your family, swear at you ... who likes that?"" Uh, not me. The Real Housewives of New Jersey, maybe, but not me. I neither adore nor abhor Fenway, but I believe its time has come and gone. I have seen the Yankees, Tigers, Giants, Orioles, White Sox and others erect fine new ballyards for future generations to enjoy. They have done so over the objections of every stubborn cuss who insists that his or her grandkids and great-grandkids must attend the old park just because I did and, oh, I love it so. Come on. Let the kids of April 20, 2022, and 2032 and 2102 have a pristine, up-to-the-minute place to watch the Sox, a place to create memories of their own. Yes, yours is a ""real"" ballpark. I enjoyed the scene in ""Moneyball"" in which the team's owner takes Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) to the park to absorb its beauty. It was such a sweet scene in that true story, I almost wish it were true. Boston's boss interviewed Billy at his Florida home, not at the park. SI: Baseball's oldest venue -- and still its best . I have been Googling a few interesting observations of late, finding quotes from ex-Sox who love the team, love the fans but, yes, may God forgive them, would love a new park. I see the Massachusetts junior senator, Scott Brown, is taking a teasing about expressing his fondness for Fenway on its 100th anniversary after having devoted considerable effort at the beginning of this 21st century to having the Red Sox build a new park next door to the Patriots' one 'way out in Foxborough. It was apparently an error on his part, for those of you scoring at home. A ""dump,"" the word the Tampa Bay boy used, is a tad harsh. Bright gents like the baseball expert Peter Gammons and the Chicago columnist Rick Morrissey have applied that same tag to Wrigley Field in recent times, absent of malice. It is not about dissing the Cubs or their fans. It is about reminding them that the park has crummy plumbing, hungry rats and crumbling concrete. It is about ballplayers who must shower, shave and dress in locker rooms about as roomy as a Kardashian's closet. ""Baseball's Most Beloved Park"" it reads on a sign by a Fenway doorway, or at least it did the last time I was there. It is a matter of opinion, not fact. Let's let the Red Sox have the benefit of the doubt and concede that this claim is true. Let it be beloved. Let it be revered. Let it be blown to bits, then build a bigger, better, more beautiful Fenway Park, tall green left-field wall and all. I love you, Boston. Don't hate me.

"(CNN) -- Better late than never. As those in green danced with joy and celebrated the apparent end of Mexico's World Cup curse, those in orange were already planning their flights home. Mexico, which had failed to win a last-16 match in its previous five attempts, finally appeared to have cracked it. Giovani Dos Santos' strike, which came in the 48th minute, looked like it had secured a quarterfinal place for only the third time in nation's history -- and the first on foreign soil. And yet, with the prize within its grasp, Mexico faltered at the last. With just two minutes of the contest remaining, step forward Wesley Sneijder. A man for whom nothing had gone right all afternoon. His passing was wayward, his touch was off and the quality with which he has been blessed appeared to have temporarily escaped him. But when the Netherlands needed the Galatasaray man the most, he delivered. With 88 minutes on the clock, the ball came out to Sneijder on the edge of the penalty area and he sent an unstoppable right-footed effort into the bottom corner. Cue the hysteria from the Dutch fans, who had already consigned themselves to an evening of drowning their sorrows and an early flight back to Amsterdam. In the energy-sapping conditions of Fortaleza, where the temperature pitchside reached over 100, Mexico suddenly wilted. For the best part of 90 minutes it had negated the attacking threat of the Dutch, seen off Robin van Persie and looked good value for a place in the last eight. After all, for a team which only qualified for the tournament following a playoff against New Zealand, a place in the quarterfinals would represent a huge success. Mexico, led by the charismatic and affable Miguel Herrera, have become one of the most difficult sides to beat. But when it needed its resilience most, it failed. Instead, Arjen Robben, the man who had tormented Mexico for large periods of the second half, was brought down inside the penalty area by Rafael Marquez. While the Mexican players protested following Robben's spectacular fall, their anger fell on deaf ears. ""He dived three times, he should have cautioned him the first time,"" Miguel Herrera, the Mexico coach, told reporters of Robben after the game. ""It seems to me the reason (we lost) was the referee, the man with the whistle. He left us outside the next stage of the World Cup. ""If the referee starts marking fouls that don't exist, you leave the World Cup to circumstances out of your hands. We expect the referee committee to take a look at that and that this gentleman goes home, just like us."" Herrera was still seething after the game as he addressed the press -- and television replays suggested he had a point. Nevertheless, a penalty was awarded and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar showed remarkable composure to fire low into the corner and break Mexican hearts in the fourth minute of six added on. ""The players showed they had faith and belief until the very end,"" van Gaal told reporters following the 2-1 victory. ""The humidity was not in our favor, so when you see that until the very last minute we were fresher and fitter than the Mexicans, that is a big compliment to my players. ""Not only did they have belief but physically they prepared so well to play this match. That of course gives us enormous confidence going forward."" Few would have expected such late drama, with the Dutch appearing to struggle to create many clear-cut opportunities before falling behind. Mexico, which defeated Cameroon and Croatia either side of a draw with Brazil, started positively and felt it should have been given a penalty when Ron Vlaar fouled Hector Herrera. Those appeals were dismissed by referee Pedro Proenca, as were the shouts from the Dutch when Robben was upended by a combination of Hector Moreno and Marquez. With both teams having slowed down play following the tournament's first three-minute cooling break, introduced by FIFA to combat dehydration in the hot weather, it was little surprise that the first half ended goalless. But the second 45 minutes proved a far more entertaining affair -- especially given Mexico's rapid start. Dos Santos received the ball 20 yards from goal and his fierce effort flew past Jasper Cillessen and into the far corner. That goal appeared to stun the Dutch -- a side which had swept all before it in the group stage. After all, this was a Netherlands team which had dismantled reigning world champion Spain 5-1, beaten Chile comfortably and fought back to see off Australia. But in the oppressive heat, the men in orange appeared to be toiling under the heavy sun. When the Dutch did get forward, they found the irrepressible Ochoa in the form of his life. Already a star following his performance against Brazil, where he produced save after save, the Mexico goalkeeper was at it again. First, he denied Stefan de Vrij from close range, pushing his header onto the post before standing tall to block Robben's effort. The Dutch looked down and out. And then it happened. Step forward Sneijder, one of the few experienced players who was there that fateful night in South Africa when his side was beaten in the final by Spain. With just two minutes remaining, his rasping effort flew past Ochoa and breathed new life into his ailing teammates. Huntelaar, who had replaced the ineffective van Persie, then converted his injury-time penalty to spark wild celebrations. A date with Costa Rica now awaits the Dutch -- for Mexico, it's home time once again. Brazil 2014 World Cup: schedule of matches .","Netherlands defeats Mexico 2-1 in Fortaleza .

"(CNN) -- Brenda Cruz and her family were flabbergasted by what they spotted as they were driving on Interstate 77 in North Carolina this weekend: . A man was hanging on to the back of a fast-moving white sedan in the right-hand lane. ""All of a sudden the kids say, 'There's someone on top of the car on the trunk,' and I'm like, 'What?'"" Brenda Cruz told CNN affiliate WSOC. The man was lying across the outside of the car's trunk, she said, as the vehicle sped along at around 50 mph Saturday afternoon. She pulled out her cell phone and began to film the bizarre scene as other cars on the road slowed down, waiting to see what would happen. The family said they witnessed the man shattering the rear windshield before clambering inside the moving vehicle, which was being driven by a woman and had a child in a car seat inside. ""Whenever he lifted his hand to smash the glass open, it looked like it was something sharp,"" Brenda's 17-year-old son, Samuel, told WSOC, saying he was concerned about what might have happened next. ""I'm really worried because I just hope she's OK, you know, with her kid,"" he said. Authorities said Monday that the incident began as a domestic dispute at a nearby Payless ShoeSource and continued on the highway. ""The female driver is the victim and will not be charged,"" said Keith Trietley, spokesman for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. ""She chose not to prosecute the male suspect. They are known to one another and were involved in a domestic dispute. No one was injured during the incident."" Trietley declined to identify the couple, noting that no charges have been filed.

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy is once again top of golf's world rankings and, on the evidence of his current form, the Northern Irishman is set for a long stay at the summit. Two weeks after winning the British Open, McIlroy overhauled Spain's Sergio Garcia to triumph at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational in Akron, Ohio on Sunday. The 25-year-old posted a four-under-par final round of 66 to finish 15 under for the tournament, two strokes clear of Garcia -- who tied for second behind McIlroy at Hoylake last month. McIlroy is now red-hot favorite to seal his fourth major crown at the U.S. PGA Championship, which begins Thursday at the Valhalla Golf Club in Kentucky. ""It's the most comfortable I've ever felt trying to close out a golf tournament out there today,"" he told the PGA Tour's official website after eating up Garcia's three-shot overnight lead in the final round at Firestone, during which Tiger Woods withdrew with a recurrence of his back injury. ""I felt normal,"" McIlroy added. ""I felt like it was the first round or the second round. It didn't feel like a fourth round."" His fortunes are in stark contrast to this time last year. A switch of equipment supplier coincided with a slump in performance which culminated with McIlroy enduring a torrid time at the 2013 British Open, where he failed to make the cut. Fast forward 12 months and McIlroy has the Claret Jug sat on his mantelpiece after successfully mastering his Nike clubs -- in particular his driver. He hit the ball further than any of his competitors over the four days of play at the World Golf Championships event, leading the field in driving distance with an average of 317 yards. ""The big thing for me is if you let it affect you mentally, it makes it more difficult,"" said McIlroy, reflecting on his difficult spell last year. ""If you can stay strong mentally when you're going through the struggles you always seem to come out the other side OK. ""It's when it affects you mentally you can start to lose confidence, then you're losing confidence in your swing. It can spiral out of control, kind of like I did last summer."" McIlroy will be aiming to win the season's final major for the second time in his career when the action tees off later this week.

"(CNN) -- Paul Mazursky, a five-time Oscar nominee who directed and wrote such films as ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice,"" ""An Unmarried Woman"" and ""Down and Out in Beverly Hills,"" has died, his agent said Tuesday. He was 84. The cause of death was not revealed, but Mazursky had been in ill health for some time. Mazursky was known for his compassionate touch as a writer and director, guiding such performers as Dyan Cannon (1969's ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice""), Art Carney (1974's ""Harry and Tonto"") and Jill Clayburgh (1978's ""An Unmarried Woman"") to Academy Award nominations for acting. Carney, in fact, won a best actor Oscar for his performance as a widower who travels cross-country with his cat, Tonto. Indeed, Mazursky was fond of such low-key, human stories, though usually with a dose of humor. ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice"" was about wife-swapping; ""An Unmarried Woman"" was about a wealthy New Yorker whose husband leaves her, putting her in the dating pool for the first time in years. In a 1977 interview with Film Comment, Mazursky said that studios would have preferred him to make films for more money and with bigger stars, but he followed his gut, opted for a lower budget and went with character actor types over movie stars. ""They would prefer that I do one for $6 million rather than $2 million and shore it up with a couple of names. It's easier to sell. And I would have done it with a big star if I thought there was one who was perfect for the part,"" he said. Instead, however, he cast people like Carney and Ron Silver (1989's ""Enemies: A Love Story""). Other Mazursky-directed films include ""Blume in Love"" (1973), ""Next Stop, Greenwich Village"" (1976), ""Moscow on the Hudson"" (1984) and ""Scenes from a Mall"" (1991). Mazursky was also a part of television history, having co-written the script for the pilot of ""The Monkees."" Mazursky started out as an actor, making his debut in Stanley Kubrick's early work ""Fear and Desire"" (1954) and guest-starring in several TV series, including ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Real McCoys."" He made frequent appearances in his own films and was an often wise-cracking presence in other works, including ""The Sopranos,"" in which he played a card dealer friend of Junior Soprano, and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" in which he played Norm, an assistant of Mel Brooks. In real life, Brooks and Mazursky were close friends. When Mazursky received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame late last year, Brooks said, ""If he were gay, and I were gay, I think we would hang out together. That's how much I love him."" ""I love you too,"" Mazursky said. ""Prove it!"" Brooks retorted. ""Pick up the bill for once, why don't you.""

"(CNN) -- I must have met Doc, as we called Maya Angelou, way before I remember. We often attended readings, but the first time she absolutely caught my attention was at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. It wasn't all that cold, but Maya and others had fur coats on. My mother, who was a big fan of the Seven Sisters colleges, had come with me. We both had on cloth coats. Doc, as we all know, was 6 feet or taller. Mommy was 4-foot-11, and I am 5-foot-2. Not only were we shorter, we felt smaller. I looked at that group and made a silent vow to never allow my mother to be with this group again without a fur coat. We purchased one soon after. When Mommy died, I shared that story with Doc. Maya laughed. ""We had no idea,"" she said. And laughed again. Mommy owes Doc. Opinion: Maya Angelou: The definition of a phenomenal woman . When Doc moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, she was not far from me in Virginia, so I got to see a lot of her. If I had any inkling she was frying chicken, I'd go down and spend the night. When Jay-Z sent her a case of wonderfully expensive champagne, those days I had to spend the night! Everyone came to Doc's place, which was great fun. You'd wake up in the morning not knowing who would be down to breakfast. The superstars; the wonderfully funny; old friends from another country; a congressman. And Doc treated them all the same. Maya Angelou remembered by those she inspired . Her ability to speak to everyone in the same voice was what made her the force she was. Our only disagreements were about food. She was a great cook, and I think of myself as a good one. We were arguing about rack of lamb, one of my specialties. My recipe comes from the late, great country cook Edna Lewis. I went home after my visit and decided I should not just talk the talk but also walk the walk. I called my good friend Joanne Gabbin from Furious Flower Poetry Center to have her come with me to Doc's to cook. Jo is a great cook, too. We got on Doc's calendar, packed all our ingredients and spices and boogied on down. Doc sat at the head of the table, where she could see everything going on in the kitchen. She inspected the lamb, checked the veggies, tasted everything and praised Joanne. I think she loved me a little bit because she, like my only living aunt, always felt free to make minor corrections. ""I think the lamb is a bit overdone,"" she offered. ""Well Edna Lewis is in heaven, and I checked with her before I put this on the table,"" I responded. We both laughed. I know if the lamb was not done properly, she would have eaten it and not said a word. I wanted to fry chicken for her, too, but time just ran out. Our mutual friend, the late author Alex Haley, always said, ""Find the good and praise it."" Maya took it to heart. She would always seek the good in any situation, or she avoided the question. Opinion: How Maya Angelou gave me life . In all my years of knowing her, I only heard her once speak ill of someone and that was well deserved. Like everyone, I have read and reread ""I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings."" And like that caged bird, Maya sought an inner freedom. We only have to look at her life to see that she took every ounce of joy life had to offer. I will remember her as a courageous woman who always wanted to love, and wish her a rightful place in literature. Some of Angelou's most powerful speeches .

"(CNN) -- It's hard to imagine a young child, strapped into a car seat under a baking sun, slowly succumbing to a hellish death. It's even harder to imagine that it could have been anything other than a terrible accident. But that's what police in Cobb County, Georgia, say happened last week when 33-year-old Justin Ross Harris left his 22-month-old son, Cooper Mills Harris, strapped into a car seat while he went to work. He's been charged with felony murder and second-degree child cruelty. Here are the key elements about this disturbing case: . What happened? On the morning of June 18, Cooper and his father stopped for breakfast at a Chick-fil-A restaurant near his office in suburban Atlanta. Afterward, Harris put his son into the rear-facing car seat for the half-mile drive to the office. Instead of taking Cooper inside to the day care at his office, police say Harris left the boy strapped into his car seat and went inside to work. According to police, he came out and opened the driver side door and put something inside at lunchtime. He left the office at 4:16 p.m., stopping a few miles later in a shopping center parking lot, where he called for help, screaming, ""What have I done?"" How did Cooper die? Although final autopsy reports aren't yet in, it appears he died the same way at least 619 other children have died since 1998, according to a study by a San Francisco State University researcher: his body got too hot and there wasn't anyone there to cool him down. It's a condition called hyperthermia. ""Essentially what happens is that the body temperature gets so high that it begins to kill the cells,"" forensic pathologist and former medical examiner Vincent DiMaio told HLN. ""It's like you're cooking something."" While hyperthermia can strike anyone with enough exposure to heat, babies and small children strapped into rear-facing car seats are at particular risk, if a parent or caregiver forgets they are there. On an 80-degree day, a car can heat to an unsafe temperature in just two minutes, according to the National Weather Service, and the temperature can rise to 123 degrees in just one hour. On the day Cooper died, the temperature peaked at 88 degrees. So why is the father charged with murder? Police at first seemed sympathetic to what seemed like a tragic accident, but later said there was more to the case. ""The chain of events that occurred in this case does not point toward simple negligence and evidence will be presented to support this allegation,"" Cobb County police Chief John R. Houser said in a statement. A subsequent affidavit released by the Magistrate Court of Cobb County may indeed support the allegation. The document states that when investigators interviewed Justin Harris, ""he stated that he recently researched, through the Internet, child deaths inside vehicles and what temperature it needs to be for that to occur. Justin stated that he was fearful this could happen."" What are his family and friends saying? Leanna Harris spoke in defense of her husband during Cooper's funeral Saturday in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Justin Harris' hometown. Justin Harris spoke as well, by phone from jail, thanking attendees ""for everything you've done for my boy."" The family has not answered questions from the media. Neither has anyone close to the family. Of the numerous family and friends of Harris contacted by CNN, none would speak. Most said they had been advised not to. Cooper's obituary says the boy was ""loved and cherished and protected by both parents and all family members for his short 22 months of life."" And on a now-closed change.org petition calling on authorities to drop the charges, several posts from people who said they know Harris spoke well of him. ""He has been nothing but a caring father and supporting husband,"" wrote one poster, identified as Michael Gordon of Northport, Alabama. What's next? Justin Harris is being held without bond at the Cobb County jail after pleading not guilty last week. He's scheduled for a preliminary appearance on July 3. Because he's charged with murder, a grand jury will also have to review his case if the magistrate in an upcoming hearing finds probable cause for the charge to stand.

"(CNN) -- Do gamers prefer to build or destroy? A look at the combat-intensive themes of most top-selling console games would suggest the latter. But then along came ""Minecraft"" for Xbox. The long-established PC game that focused on building and crafting was released for the Xbox earlier this month -- and the results should shake the notion that gamers just want to kill something. In the first 24 hours of the May 9 release, the Minecraft Xbox 360 edition was downloaded more than 400,000 times, smashing the Xbox Arcade's first-day digital sales record and becoming the fastest selling Xbox Live Arcade title in history. Markus ""Notch"" Persson, the creator of Minecraft, tweeted that this console version of Minecraft was ""profitable in an hour."" Since release, Minecraft has been skyrocketing up Xbox Live's weekly activity ranking. The most recent numbers place Minecraft in second place, ahead of the first-person shooters ""Call of Duty: Black Ops,"" ""Battlefield 3"" and ""Halo: Reach,"" in addition to the sports title ""FIFA '12."" Only ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3"" remains ahead, for the moment. This achievement is not surprising to those familiar with the ""Minecraft"" mania on the PC, where it was first launched in late 2009 and became a gaming phenomenon. In its first 15 months, Mojang, the gaming company Persson built around Minecraft, reported revenues totaling $80 million. ""Minecraft"" was not a product of the typical game development and it's not produced by one of the best-known production companies of the gaming industry. Instead, it was started by Notch -- as he's known to the game's fans -- an independent game developer who was willing to experiment with a unique game design, try a risky new online business model and forge a new relationship with gamers. He shared his thoughts on this at the official launch for Minecraft in Las Vegas. ""When I grew up with games, there was a lot of experimentation going on. People would try and create an idea, and not just copy the most successful game out there,"" he said. ""Initially I was mostly doing it because of the technical challenge, and then it became fun."" Fortune: Minecraft's pixelated profit machine . The game's formula is not entirely new. Open world ""sandbox"" games have been a part of many successful titles. This is where the player is not restricted to a particular path, either in the game's physical world or in the game's narrative. But no one had really taken this concept to the extreme that Notch has. In ""Minecraft,"" the player is placed somewhere on a gigantic world at sunrise, and that's it. There is no apparent storyline, mission or purpose, beyond a few tips and achievements. Players are given a world of their own to do with as they like, which often becomes an addictive adventure of survival, exploration and building. Yes, building. This is the core mechanic of ""Minecraft."" The world is composed of blocks that you can remove and replace. This is first done in order to survive, as players wall themselves in at night, nervously listening to the creatures roaming nearby. But then, if things go well, their imagination takes hold and a simple house becomes a castle, or the Roman Colosseum, or whatever else the player can imagine. Then full-grown adults spend the next four to six hours in a state of childhood bliss, virtually playing with Legos again. When Notch first released Minecraft to the online public, the game was far from finished, and was still in an early Alpha stage. Releasing it at this point held significant risk, he said, as players could dismiss what could be a great game because of the glitches, bugs and the unfinished quality of a pre-beta version. Instead, the opposite happened. ""Fairly soon, people started talking about it and actually appreciating it,"" Notch recalled. ""And ever since then, that's what kept me going -- people actually liking and playing it."" If selling an unfinished game online by himself wasn't risky enough, Notch took it a step further by making the classic version of the game available free. This skyrocketed the game's popularity, and close to 25 million people have since downloaded the game on their PC. More than 5.8 million copies have been purchased. Another result from this unconventional business model is the relationship it has formed between Notch and his fans. Instead of just being consumers, these early players felt they were a part of the game's development. The game updates felt like gifts to the players, instead of the natural progression toward a title's release. ""The players got invested in the testing and the suggestions and the feedback kind of early on and actually started buying the game early,"" he said. ""The way that they talked about the game is definitely why it's spread so fast, because there was no marketing before that -- just word of mouth."" One way players talked about ""Minecraft"" was through more than 4 million YouTube videos. Notch and his team at Mojang have been very responsive to fan suggestions and ideas, and have also supported the modding community, which has built a host of add-ons for the game.

Most gaming companies hope to build interest and a player base with a successful launch, especially for their first title.

"(CNN) -- Very few pandas are born each year, but even fewer of the fragile cubs stay alive. That's why zookeepers say it's a ""miracle"" after a panda gave birth to a healthy set of triplets, who have now survived over two weeks and are reportedly doing well. The cubs, which weighed 83 grams, 90 grams, and 122 grams, respectively, at birth, are thought to be the only living panda triplets in the world. The 12-year-old mother, Juxiao (whose name means ""chrysanthemum smile"") gave birth to the adorable cubs on July 29 in China's Chimelong Safari Park in the southern city of Guangzhou. The delivery took four hours, said Dong Guixin, the manager of the park. ""After nearly half a month under the care of the mother, the babies are very healthy,"" China Daily reported Dong as saying. ""They now weigh nearly two times what they did when they were born... It was a miracle for us and the births exceeded our expectations."" The new trio are now with their mother and are being cared for by a team of feeders, he said. Pandas are known for having very low survival rates. According to the Chengdu Research Base for Giant Panda Breeding, only one-third to one-half of pandas born in Chinese captivity manage to survive past infancy. In 1999, another set of giant panda triplets was born in China, but one died after three days. In the next few weeks, another little panda could enter the world: Tian Tian, a panda living in Scotland's Edinburgh Zoo, is suspected to be pregnant and may give birth before the end of August. Thanks to science, there are more baby pandas .","Panda triplets were born on July 29 in Guangzhou, China .

"(Mental Floss) -- Turns out, the best drinking stories in history are actually, well, historical. So raise a glass to your forefathers and marvel at these tales. She is not moving that fast. This is what the waitress would look like if you drank everything on her tray. 1. Admiral Edward Russell's 17th-Century throwdown . Think you can drink like a sailor? Maybe you should take a moment to reflect on what that truly means. The record for history's largest cocktail belongs to British Lord Admiral Edward Russell. In 1694, he threw an officer's party that employed a garden's fountain as the punch bowl. The concoction? A mixture that included 250 gallons of brandy, 125 gallons of Malaga wine, 1,400 pounds of sugar, 2,500 lemons, 20 gallons of lime juice, and 5 pounds of nutmeg. A series of bartenders actually paddled around in a small wooden canoe, filling up guests' cups. Not only that, but they had to work in 15-minute shifts to avoid being overcome by the fumes and falling overboard. The party continued nonstop for a full week, pausing only briefly during rainstorms to erect a silk canopy over the punch to keep it from getting watered down. In fact, the festivities didn't end until the fountain had been drunk completely dry. 2. The London Brew-nami of 1814 . The Industrial Revolution wasn't all steam engines and textile mills. Beer production increased exponentially, as well. Fortunately, the good people of England were up to the challenge and drained kegs as fast as they were made. Brewery owners became known as ""beer barons,"" and they spent their newfound wealth in an age-old manner -- by trying to party more than the next guy. Case in point: In 1814, Meux's Horse Shoe Brewery in London constructed a brewing vat that was 22 feet tall and 60 feet in diameter, with an interior big enough to seat 200 for dinner -- which is exactly how its completion was celebrated. (Why 200? Because a rival had built a vat that seated 100, of course.) After the dinner, the vat was filled to its 4,000-barrel capacity. Pretty impressive, given the grand scale of the project, but pretty unfortunate given that they overlooked a faulty supporting hoop. Yup, the vat ruptured, causing other vats to break, and the resulting commotion was heard up to 5 miles away. A wall of 1.3 million gallons of dark beer washed down the street, caving in two buildings and killing nine people by means of ""drowning, injury, poisoning by the porter fumes, or drunkenness."" The story gets even more unbelievable, though. Rescue attempts were blocked and delayed by the thousands who flocked to the area to drink directly off the road. And when survivors were finally brought to the hospital, the other patients became convinced from the smell that the hospital was serving beer to every ward except theirs. A riot broke out, and even more people were left injured. Sadly, this incident was not deemed tragic enough at the time to merit an annual memorial service and/or reenactment. 3. New York state of mind: The Dutch ingratiate themselves to the natives . In 1609, the Dutch sent English explorer Henry Hudson westward for a third attempt at finding the fabled Northeast Passage. A near mutiny forced him southward, and upon reaching land, he encountered members of the Delaware Indian tribe. To foster good relations, Hudson shared his brandy with the tribal chief, who soon passed out. But upon waking up the next day, he asked Hudson to pour some more for the rest of his tribe. From then on, the Indians referred to the island as Manahachtanienk -- literally, ""The High Island."" And not ""high"" as in ""tall;"" high as in ""the place where we got blotto."" Most people would agree that Manhattan has stayed true to the spirit of its name ever since. 4. The worst aftertaste in history . In 1805, British Admiral Horatio Nelson was killed during the Battle of Trafalgar off the coast of Spain. Most sailors were simply put to rest at sea, but as an admiral, Nelson had to be brought back to England for an official burial. To preserve his body during the voyage home, the second-in-command stored Nelson's body in the ship's vat of rum and halted all liquor rations to the crew. Not a bad idea, but when the ship reached port, officials went to retrieve Nelson's body and found the vat dry. Disregarding good taste (in every sense), the crew had been secretly drinking from it the entire way home. After that, naval rum was referred to as Nelson's Blood. 5. Indian elephants raid the liquor cabinet . No wonder they don't sell beer at the circus. Apparently, elephants like to get wasted. In fact, an outpost of the Indian army in the jungle region of Bagdogra has been under attack ever since a local herd of elephants raided the base in search of food and discovered the soldiers' entire winter rations of rum. Since then, the pachyderms have regularly raided the base for a drink and have smashed down all defenses put up by the army, including electrified fences and firewalls. According to The Daily Telegraph, ""An officer recently posted there explained that the elephants broke the rum bottles by cleverly curling their trunks around the bottom. Then they empty the contents down their throats. They soon got drunk, he said, and swayed around. They enjoy themselves and then return to the jungle."" This is by no means a singular incident, though. The animal kingdom is well-known for its ability to identify fruit that's begun to ferment. Anthropologists even believe this is how early man discovered alcohol -- by observing the strange behavior of animals on a fruit bender. E-mail to a friend .

"Cape Town, South Africa (CNN) -- Africa's passenger airline industry may still be awaiting full take off but Boeing has identified the continent as a market ripe with potential. The U.S. company -- one of the world's biggest airplane manufacturers -- has found its order book filled with an increasing number of African clients in recent years. But with airlines based on the continent still only accounting for a fraction of overall air traffic between Africa and the rest of the world, the company's Vice President of Sales for Africa, Van Rex Gallard believes there remains plenty of room for further expansion. ""Right now the African market for the airlines is quite small,"" he says. ""African airlines only have around 2% of the total of revenues of the traffic between Africa and the rest of the world, so to me the potential is huge,"" he adds. The latent ""potential"" that Gallard refers to is confirmed by industry statistics and future passenger projections. According to research conducted by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in February 2011, Africa is now the second fastest growing region in the world in terms of commercial aviation, behind China. The Airbus Global Market Forecast published earlier this month meanwhile reported that sub-Saharan Africa alone will require at least 542 new aircraft by 2020 to meet rising passenger numbers. By providing the technology and expertise to meet these increased capacity requirements, Gallard believes that Boeing and the African airlines they provide for can jointly reap the benefits. ""We have a lot of customers in Africa and this is actually a very exciting period,"" he says. ""The numbers, if everything stays the way it is right now ... without the African airlines growing faster and the way they should, it would be around 800 airplanes for the next 20 years (and) worth around 100 billion dollars,"" he adds. Gallard cites airlines such as Nigeria's Arik Air -- which recently purchased two 747-8 Passenger Airplanes, Boeing's biggest passenger planes ---, Ethiopia Airlines, Kenya Airways and Rwanda Air as some of the companies striving to meet Africa's burgeoning aviation and connectivity needs. But while bullish about the potential of these companies in the years to come, he remains wary of the infrastructure, political and technological challenges they must first navigate if they are to fully meet their potential. Gallard cites a lack of trained pilots, poor safety records, African governments unwilling to open their skies and foreign competitors -- particularly from the Middle East -- who can undercut the prices of African airlines, as some of his most pressing concerns. Yet in spite of these issues Gallard remains optimistic about what can be achieved if airlines, manufacturers and governments work together for the good of continent as a whole. ""Aviation ... is a machine that will develop the region,"" he says. If governments and African airlines can combine their interests and meet these challenges, he adds ""they will be able to find growth and development,"" across Africa, taking full ""advantage of this machine.""","Africa is one of the fastest growing regions for commercial aviation.

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of police confronted rioters in a small Dutch town where a 16-year-old girl's birthday party invitation on Facebook spawned a large gathering that turned destructive, authorities said Saturday. Video of the incident showed rioters hurling glass bottles and other debris at security teams in Haren, which is located 115 miles (185 kilometers) northeast of Amsterdam and is home to about 20,000 residents. Prosecutors said 34 people were arrested Friday night and Saturday morning after rioters torched at least two cars, threw stones and smashed storefront windows. Police embrace social media as crime-fighting tool . At least 36 people were injured, including one police officer, according to police spokesman Paul Haedanus. One man suffered a broken jaw, he said. ""Last night, scum wreaked havoc in our community,"" Haren Mayor Rob Bats told CNN affiliate NOS. ""Haren woke up this morning after a dramatic evening and night."" Bats said the incident had a ""tremendous impact,"" even though authorities had been preparing for it. Earlier, the mayor had persuaded the girl's family not to hold the party, authorities said, and unsuccessfully urged revelers not to attend. Prior to Friday's mayhem, Oscar Dros, the town's chief of police, said he had contacted authorities in Germany to discuss their own experiences with riots. ""An incident like the one in Haren last night is unprecedented in the Netherlands,"" Dros told NOS. Prosecutors said revelers began arriving Friday afternoon, though some appeared ""ready and prepared for confrontation."" Authorities estimate that at least 3,000 people turned up for the event, and that specific ""ring leaders"" had contributed to the destruction. News of the party had gone viral on social media before Friday, authorities said. There were multiple mentions of an American film called Project X, in which three high school seniors throw a birthday party that spirals out of control. On Saturday, a group called Project Clean-X Haren emerged on Facebook, which posted video of organizers wielding shovels and carrying flowers. Last year, the phenomenon emerged in other cities, including London and Philadelphia, where the city cited the culprits as members of a ""flash mob"" who decided to gather at a given place via e-mail and social media.

Hanksville, Utah (VBS.TV) -- Travel twenty minutes north of this tiny town, to the craggy red desert of the San Rafael Swell, and you may discover a spaceship. The cylindrical craft isn't from another world, but it offers a glimpse of one. It is the centerpiece of the Mars Desert Research Station, an environment created by the Mars Society, a growing non-profit organization that supports the research, exploration, and eventual colonization of the mysterious red planet. The swell, chosen as a simulation site for its topical resemblance to Mars, provides the volunteer researchers who come here with an opportunity to live and work in a Mars analog, an environment that's as close to the red planet as is earthly possible. While conducting geological and psychological experiments that could someday be useful to a real Martian expedition, this small group of Mars devotees -- some space scientists, some simply eager adventurers -- live and work in complete ""sim."" They consume only dehydrated, shelf-stable food like Bisquick and ghee, exercise to preserve their muscles in ""reduced gravity,"" abide by the ""if it's yellow, let it mellow"" adage in an effort to conserve water, and wear spacesuits when they venture outside. Animating their work is a vision of planetary colonization that is steadily creeping from the realm of sci-fi to reality. With the retirement of the Space Shuttle, NASA is shifting its focus to longer-term manned missions -- a dream that has been outlined by President Obama. ""Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn, operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time, ultimately in ways that are more sustainable and even indefinite,"" the president told NASA in April of 2010. He then followed this up stating by the mid 2030s, ""I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth. And landing on Mars will follow."" See the rest of Mars on Earth at VBS.TV . Even if trips to Mars are still decades away, public interest appears to be reaching new heights. After the Journal of Cosmology published a paper in October suggesting that the first trips to Mars would be feasible only as one-way journeys, the journal's editor received over 400 emails from people ""volunteering"" for the mission. Motherboard's Kelly Loudenberg recently paid a visit to the Station to get a glimpse of what life on Mars looks like on Earth. Compared with present government-run experiments, like NASA's undersea NEEMO and the European Space Agency's Mars 500 -- a six-man, 18-month-long isolation test inside a mock spaceship -- life in the Society's desert station can sometimes look like an elaborate make-believe game for grown-ups. But this isn't a lark or a theoretical exercise: living in a state of constant ""dress-up,"" in the words of crew member Nori Cassman, is meant to prepare for the possibility of life -- human life -- on Mars.","Volunteer researchers live and work at station in the Utah desert, simulating life on Mars .

"(CNN) -- If you're traveling by air this month, there's a good chance the government owes you money. Don't believe me? You can thank Congress and its inability to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. Here's how you can get your money back, though be prepared to wait a little while for things to settle. Congress periodically has to renew the authorization of the FAA to do a variety of things, and one of those things is collecting taxes on air travel. As with everything in Washington, the left and the right all try to sneak in politically charged riders that prevent the FAA reauthorization from moving forward to fund important projects such as the NextGen air traffic control overhaul. Until last month, Congress had been simply extending the current authorization for months at a time until something could be worked out. That changed on July 23. When July 22 ended, so did the current authorization for the FAA and that meant it could no longer collect taxes. There was hope that once the debt-ceiling bill was passed, attention would shift to getting the FAA back up and running, but both chambers decided to take the month off. Then Thursday, congressional leaders reached a deal to resume funding temporarily for the FAA, and the Senate passed the legislation on Friday. Secrets to avoiding flight delays . When FAA authorization ended, four taxes on air travel had to be dropped: . • The 7.5% tax on the base airline ticket price • The domestic segment tax of $3.70 per person per segment (a single takeoff and single landing) • The international travel facilities tax of $16.30 per person for flights that begin or end in the United States, or $8.20 per person for a flight that begins or ends in Alaska or Hawaii • The 6.25% tax on the amount paid for transporting property by air . As you can see, this applies to both domestic and international flights on any airline, regardless of where it's based. So if you bought a round-trip ticket going from Jacksonville, Florida, to Los Angeles via Atlanta for $500, here's how the taxes and fees break down: . • Base fare -- $425.30  • 7.5% excise tax -- $31.90  • Domestic segment tax -- $14.80 ($3.70 per flight segment)  • September 11 security fee -- $10 ($2.50 per flight segment)  • Passenger facility charges -- $18 ($4.50 per departure from each airport) The passenger would be owed $46.70 for the excise and segment taxes if this ticket was purchased before July 23 for travel since the FAA shutdown. Summer travel: Watch out for amateurs . So if you bought your ticket before July 23 for travel between July 23 and, well, whenever the FAA comes back to life, then you can get a refund for the taxes that you paid at the time of purchase. If you bought a ticket beginning on July 23, then you weren't charged those taxes. If the FAA is reauthorized before you take that trip, then you probably won't have to pay back taxes. While Congress could try to collect, it would be virtually impossible to make it happen and ill-advised to even try. The Internal Revenue Service has issued guidelines on how exactly to go about getting your refund. First stop? The place where you bought your ticket. If you booked through a travel agent, go back to that agent and ask for help getting the refund. Your agent will be able to keep on top of the news to see how and when to make this happen. I wouldn't, however, bother doing it until your trip is completed so that you know exactly how much is owed to you. (If you file for a refund after your first flight, then you have no way of knowing if the FAA will again be collecting taxes by the time you return.) If you booked directly, talk to your airline. So far, few airlines have issued much guidance. We do know that both Delta Air Lines and US Airways have committed to refund the taxes directly to the travelers. Delta says it will issue a refund ""once an agreement is reached with the IRS on the procedure for doing so."" US Airways said effectively the same thing. Other airlines, however, have either given no clarification or have sent people back to the IRS. JetBlue, for example, is telling customers to go directly to the IRS to get money back. To do that, however, is also an undefined process. According to the IRS, travelers must ""submit proof of taxes paid and travel dates to the IRS under procedures that are under development. The IRS will provide additional guidance at a later date."" In other words, if you bought your ticket before July 23 and are traveling after, you are owed money. We just don't know how you'll get that money back yet. I imagine the IRS is hoping people don't make their claims and the agency can pocket the extra cash, but the money is rightfully yours. Keep all your documents for completed travel and stayed tuned for updates on the IRS procedures.","Fliers who bought tickets before the FAA shutdown might be entitled to a tax refund .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration took steps Friday to fire 36 screeners and bosses at Hawaii's Honolulu International Airport after an investigation substantiated allegations that bags were allowed on planes without proper screening. The firing is believed the biggest in the agency's history, and officials said it underscores that they will not tolerate employees who compromise security. In March, Honolulu's KITV 4 News reported that TSA officers assigned to a morning shift regularly allowed checked bags to be loaded onto flights on nine daily departures without being screened for explosives. Sources told the TV station that the lapses occurred for as long as four months and involved thousands of checked bags. CNN confirmed the investigation. TSA officers are required to screen 100 percent of all checked bags before they are stored in the cargo holds of passenger aircraft. TSA officials said they did not know exactly how many bags were allowed onto flights without being inspected but said the lapse took place during the last four months of 2010. A TSA official said that in addition to rank-and-file screeners and some supervisors, the airport's federal security director and assistant federal security director for screening have received letters proposing their removal. A number of TSA employees also are being recommended for suspensions, the agency said. ""TSA holds its work force to the highest ethical standards, and we will not tolerate employees who in any way compromise the security of the traveling public,"" Administrator John Pistole said in a statement. ""We have taken appropriate action through our newly established Office of Professional Responsibility and are committed to ensuring our high security standards are upheld in Hawaii and throughout the country."" The TSA said that after it became aware of the problem, it took steps to ensure that every bag is properly screened at the airport. The TSA routinely tests security operations to ensure that protocols are being followed. The TSA said it used closed-circuit TV, random inspections, covert tests, and peer and management oversight to check on the integrity of the system.","NEW: Firings believed to be largest in agency history .

"(CNN) -- On January 19, a team of at least 15 people assassinated Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. Dubai police released video footage of 11 of them. Although it was obviously a very professional operation, the 27 minutes of video is fascinating in its banality. Team members walk through the airport, check into and out of hotels, get into and out of taxis. They make no effort to hide themselves from the cameras, sometimes seeming to stare directly into them. They obviously don't care that they're being recorded, and -- in fact -- the cameras didn't prevent the assassination, nor as far as we know have they helped as yet in identifying the killers. Pervasive security cameras don't substantially reduce crime. This fact has been demonstrated repeatedly: in San Francisco, California, public housing; in a New York apartment complex; in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; in Washington; in study after study in both the U.S. and the U.K. Nor are they instrumental in solving many crimes after the fact. There are exceptions, of course, and proponents of cameras can always cherry-pick examples to bolster their argument. These success stories are what convince us; our brains are wired to respond more strongly to anecdotes than to data. But the data are clear: CCTV cameras have minimal value in the fight against crime. Although it's comforting to imagine vigilant police monitoring every camera, the truth is very different, for a variety of reasons: technological limitations of cameras, organizational limitations of police and the adaptive abilities of criminals. No one looks at most CCTV footage until well after a crime is committed. And when the police do look at the recordings, it's very common for them to be unable to identify suspects. Criminals don't often stare helpfully at the lens and -- unlike the Dubai assassins -- tend to wear sunglasses and hats. Cameras break far too often. Even when they afford quick identification -- think of the footage of the September 11 terrorists going through airport security or the July 7 London transport bombers just before the bombs exploded -- police are often able to identify those suspects even without the cameras. Cameras afford a false sense of security, encouraging laziness when we need police to be vigilant. The solution isn't for police to watch the cameras more diligently. Unlike an officer walking the street, cameras look only in particular directions at particular locations. Criminals know this and can easily adapt by moving their crimes to places not watched by a camera -- and there will always be such places. And although a police officer on the street can respond to a crime in progress, someone watching a CCTV screen can only dispatch an officer to arrive much later. By their very nature, cameras result in underused and misallocated police resources. Cameras aren't completely ineffective, of course. Used properly, they're effective in reducing crime in enclosed areas with minimal foot traffic. Combined with adequate lighting, they substantially reduce both personal attacks and auto-related crime in multistory parking garages. And sometimes it is cost-effective for a store to install cameras to catch shoplifters or a casino to install cameras to detect cheaters. But these are instances where there is a specific risk at a specific location. The important question isn't whether cameras solve past crime or deter future crime; it's whether they're a good use of resources. They're expensive, both in money and in their Orwellian effects on privacy and civil liberties. Their inevitable misuse is another cost; police have spied on naked women in their own homes, shared nude images, sold best-of videos and even spied on national politicians. Though we might be willing to accept these downsides for a real increase in security, cameras don't provide that. Despite our predilection for technological solutions over human ones, the funds now spent on CCTV cameras would be far better spent on hiring and training police officers. We live in a unique time in our society: Cameras are everywhere, but we can still see them. Ten years ago, cameras were much rarer than they are today. Ten years from now, they'll be so small, you won't even notice them. Already, people can buy surveillance cameras in household objects to spy on their spouses and baby sitters -- I particularly like the one hidden in a shower mirror -- or cameras in pens to spy on their colleagues, and they can remotely turn on laptop cameras to spy on anyone. Companies are developing police state-type CCTV surveillance technologies for China, technology that will find its way into countries like the U.S. If universal surveillance were the answer, lots of us would have moved to the former East Germany. If surveillance cameras were the answer, camera-happy London, with something like 500,000 of them at a cost of $700 million, would be the safest city on the planet. We didn't, and it isn't, because surveillance and surveillance cameras don't make us safer. The money spent on cameras in London, and in cities across America, could be much better spent on actual policing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Schneier.

"(CNN) -- In the sight of Rio de Janeiro's Christ the Redeemer, the man who would be king awaits his destiny. Diminutive and unassuming, Lionel Messi's faith in his ability has never been in question -- but a God-like shadow has always haunted him. If Diego Maradona is a deity to Argentines, then Messi is a prophet. ""He was our water in the desert,"" national coach Alejandro Sabella said of Messi after his side's World Cup quarterfinal victory over Belgium. Messi may not be Moses -- the ability to turn a rock into a pool of water is a stretch too far even for the Barcelona star -- but his football powers frequently attract supernatural praise. After his two goals against Nigeria, opposition coach Stephen Keshi declared that Messi was of a different planet -- specifically Jupiter, although he didn't explain why. Messi's achievements are well documented -- 381 goals in 466 matches for Barcelona, three European Champions League titles and six Spanish La Liga triumphs only tell half the story. Four times he has been named world player of the year, while his face is posted on billboards across the world, with sponsors clamoring for his signature. And yet, back where it all began, he does not receive the same affection as he does in the streets of Catalunya. ""The name of Maradona will always be a heavy burden on Messi's shoulders,"" says Cristina Perez, one of Argentina's leading sports journalists. Maradona only ever won a Spanish Cup with Barcelona, before guiding Napoli to two Italian league titles, but it was on the international stage where he truly left his mark -- most notably leading Argentina to World Cup glory in 1986. ""Maradona's achievements as a footballer were absolutely stunning,"" Perez told CNN. ""He used his gifts and guts to beat them all one by one before winning the World Cup in a glorious performance."" As much as his skill at Mexico '86, Maradona's use of his hand to deflect the ball past England goalkeeper Peter Shilton in Argentina's 2-1 quarterfinal victory is still debated to this day. Was he a cheat or was this a professional doing anything to create an advantage for his team? A bit of both, according to Maradona. ""A little bit by the Hand of God, another bit by the head of Maradona,"" is how he described his goal afterwards. ""That is why people forgive him for almost everything and still celebrate even the 'Hand of God' goal as an emblem of cunning and hunger of triumph,"" says Perez. Maradona's performances at that tournament still astound to this very day. The way he ran through the bewildered England defense in Mexico City to score his second goal, just minutes after his first controversial effort, led to it being labeled one of the greatest in football history. In the semifinal Maradona scored twice against Belgium in a 2-0 win, beating four Belgian defenders to score his second goal. In the final, he set up Jorge Burruchaga to score the winning goal as Argentina claimed a 3-2 victory over West Germany. His performances secured hero status in Argentina and allowed him build up a huge amount of goodwill which would be sorely tested later when he was banned for drugs at the 1994 World Cup. Maradona, was a man of the people, a boy who had grown up playing football on the streets of Buenos Aires, fighting each and every day to make his way in the world. He had something about him that people could relate to -- something Messi, for all of his qualities, did not possess. ""Leo doesn't have the charisma or the eccentric side which helped build Maradona's gifts as a player,"" says Perez. ""He had a provocative and flamboyant personality -- he's still known as God. ""But nobody can live on the past and the future depends on Messi's talents, otherwise there will be nothing more but nostalgia."" Messi and Maradona could scarcely be more opposite in character and lifestyle. In the lead-up to the triumphant World Cup triumph in 1986, Maradona was in a daze. A public row over an illegitimate child with his mistress threatened to ruin the nation's hopes, while throughout his career he was linked with the Camorra -- the Neopolitan mafia -- and, having suffered defeat in the 1990 World Cup final against Germany, was then banned for drug taking at the 1994 tournament in the U.S. But in 1986 he single-handedly carried an Argentine nation, still recovering from the impact of the Falklands War, onwards to victory. It was the pinnacle of his international career which spanned 91 games and 34 goals. Messi is more of a private and retiring type -- while he is not shy in coming forward with the ball at his feet, he does not command the same attention within Argentina that Maradona enjoyed. Much of that has to do with Messi's upbringing. While Maradona grew up and made his name in Argentina, Messi moved to Barcelona at the age of 13. He is quite open about the decision to uproot from his hometown of Rosario in Santa Fe and move halfway across the world. ""When I was 11 years old they discovered that I had a growth hormone deficiency and I had to start a treatment to help me to grow. Every night I had to stick a needle into my legs, night after night after night, every day of the week, and this over a period of three years,"" he said in the book ""Messi,"" by Guillem Balague. ""I was so small, they said that when I went onto the pitch, or when I went to school, I was always the smallest of all. It was like this until I finished the treatment and I then started to grow properly."" And grow he did -- not just in height but in stature too. Messi was the focal point of Pep Guardiola's Barcelona revolution and the emergence of tiki-taka football which dominated Spanish and European football. Yet as his stock at Barcelona rose with each passing game, those back in Argentina remained skeptical. The accusation was that Messi was not one of them. This was a player who had abandoned his homeland before he had managed to form any kind of Argentine identity -- he was Catalan. ""There are still some people -- too many people in my opinion, because there shouldn't be any at all -- who aren't totally convinced by him,"" Argentine football expert Sam Kelly told CNN. ""But the vociferousness of his celebrations, the quality of his performances since Sabella took charge in particular, and his undoubted centrality to the team, has now won over all but the most tiresome drunken critics. ""He doesn't have the same 'everyman' feel as Maradona, and it's difficult to imagine him ever shooting his mouth off as much, but bearing in mind he's only just turned 27 I think he will one day be considered on the same level as Maradona the player -- but the warmth of feeling for the person might never quite match up to Maradona."" Four years ago, when Messi and Maradona combined their powers at the 2010 World Cup -- it proved disastrous. Messi failed to sparkle, Maradona cut a figure of fun on the touchline as coach and Argentina was thrashed 4-0 in the quarterfinal by a rampant Germany. Perhaps now it is time for revenge, for on Sunday, Messi will captain Argentina in the World Cup final -- his 93rd appearance for the Albiceleste -- against Germany. He has managed 42 goals in that time, four of which have come in this tournament. Now more than ever, Argentina needs Messi -- it needs the ability to escape the problems which threaten to plague the country, notably a $100 billion default, with the economy shrinking by 11% and unemployment sky-rocketing. Argentine officials will meet with a mediator in New York on Friday to end a long-running dispute with investors who turned down restructuring terms on the nation's debt after 2002. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has not missed the opportunity to take advantage of the World Cup, with the government running nationalistic adverts on state-run television during the games. If the tactic is to distract the public then it has worked to some extent -- and Messi has played his part. Those celebrating the prospect of a first World Cup final in 24 years allowed their worries to disappear at least temporarily as they celebrated the nation's Independence Day with extra fervor. But if Argentina fails to reach a deal by July 30, it will fall into its second sovereign debt in 12 years. For the moment, though, monetary difficulties are put to one side as the nation fixates on the chance to become world champion for the first time in 28 years. ""I don't remember such feeling of contentment since I was a child and the return of democracy after the dictatorship in 1983 and then again when we won 1986 World Cup,"" added Perez. ""In a time of economic crises and scandals of corruption in the government, this moment provides a huge relief in the middle of adversity. ""So reaching the final game gives us real happiness and makes the country proud."" Germany represents an almighty challenge for Messi and his team. This side, which obliterated host nation Brazil 7-1 in Tuesday's semifinal, believes this is the moment its potential is finally fulfilled. But for Argentina, this opportunity is one it cannot afford to pass up after waiting for so long. ""Brasil, Decime Qué Se Siente"" — translated to ""Brazil, Tell Me How It Feels"" -- is the song that has been sung throughout the tournament by Argentine fans confident of their team's success. Those words have become more venomous since Brazil's abject exit, and those who had dreamed of a home victory could be about to witness the host country's worst nightmare -- an Argentine World Cup-winning party on the Copacabana. That is the dream that 40 million Argentines will pray for their footballing prophet to deliver.","Argentina faces Germany in Sunday's World Cup final .

"(CNN) -- Arizona has temporarily halted executions after the prolonged death of a convicted killer during an execution described by Sen. John McCain and others as tantamount to torture. It took death row inmate Joseph Wood two hours to die Wednesday afternoon. His attorney says Wood ""gasped and struggle to breathe"" after receiving a novel combination of drugs. McCain told Politico he supports the death penalty in some cases, but he said Wood's execution was carried out in a ""terrible"" way. ""The lethal injection needs to be an indeed lethal injection and not the bollocks-upped situation that just prevailed. That's torture,"" he told Politico on Thursday. The Arizona Republican knows a little something about torture. McCain served as a U.S. military pilot in Vietnam. He was shot down, captured and beaten and tortured. After Gov. Jan Brewer ordered a review, the state's attorney general ordered a halt to all executions, pending the investigation of the Wood case. ""I have been advised by the Arizona attorney general that his office will not seek any warrants of execution prior to the completion of the review of this matter,"" said Corrections Director Charles Ryan. Reporter Troy Hayden witnessed the execution and compared Wood's death last breaths to ""a fish on shore gulping for air."" Wood's attorneys even tried to stop the execution more than halfway through, with one calling it ""bungled"" and ""botched."" State officials and his victims' relatives disagreed, saying Wood snored and didn't appear to be in agony. Opinion: 5 ways to improve the U.S. death penalty . Reports that the execution was botched are ""erroneous,"" Ryan said. Wood was comatose and never in pain during his execution, he added. ""The record clearly shows the inmate was fully and deeply sedated ... three minutes after the administration of the execution drugs."" Arizona execution raises questions over novel lethal injections . Wood's slow death is fueling a debate stirred up as states look for new drug combinations for lethal injections, thanks in part to pharmaceutical companies' decisions to withhold or stop making drugs used in the past. ""It took Joseph Wood two hours to die, and he gasped and struggled to breathe for about an hour and 40 minutes. We will renew our efforts to get information about the manufacturer of drugs as well as how Arizona came up with the experimental formula of drugs it used today,"" attorney Dale Baich said in a statement. He added, ""Arizona appears to have joined several other states who have been responsible for an entirely preventable horror -- a bungled execution."" Oklahoma's botched lethal injection marks new front in battle over executions . One of the victims' relatives had a strongly different view -- that he didn't suffer, and that he got what he deserved. ""I don't believe he was gasping for air; I don't believe he was suffering. It sounded to me like was snoring,"" said the relative, Jeanne Brown. ""You don't know what excruciating is. What's excruciating is seeing your dad laying there in a pool of blood, seeing your sister laying there in a pool of blood. This man deserved it. And I shouldn't really call him a man,"" she said. Wood had been convicted of murder and assault in the 1989 deaths of his estranged girlfriend and her father. The state used midazolam, an anesthetic, and hydromorphone, a narcotic painkiller that, with an overdose, halts breathing and stops the heart from beating. It's one of the new combinations that states have tried -- with some controversial results -- after manufacturers based or operating in Europe prevented U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions.

"(CNN) -- Robin Williams touched more people emotionally than he will ever know. After the news broke that the beloved comedic actor had taken his own life on Monday, hundreds of tributes poured in to CNN iReport. Many were from people who had met him over the years. ""I told him that I have waited 30 years for this moment and that it was an honor. This look came over his face like that comment had really touched him,"" said Dan McMaster, who met Williams during his Weapons of Self-Destruction tour in 2009. From a surprise hug for a woman during a stand-up comedy show to visiting a dying child to fulfill her last wish, the stories of how Williams affected those he met were profound. The actor was a longtime supporter of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and a big supporter of the United Service Organizations, or USO, which provides support and morale-boosting performances to U.S. troops and their families.

"(CNN) -- The Arkansas medical examiner has ruled the death of a man shot while handcuffed in the back of a police car as a suicide, the state crime lab announced Monday. Chavis Carter, 21, died July 29 while in the back of a Jonesboro, Arkansas, police car. The police report from that night shows officers detained Carter after learning there was a warrant for his arrest in Mississippi and searched him twice before leaving him handcuffed in the backseat of a patrol car. ""At the time of discharge, the muzzle of the gun was placed against the right temporal scalp,"" the crime lab's report states. Police said they discovered a .380-caliber Cobra semi-automatic pistol when the found Carter's body slumped over. Many people in Jonesboro were skeptical about the shooting, as was Carter's mother. ""I think they killed him,"" Theresa Carter told CNN on Wednesday. ""I mean, my son wasn't suicidal."" She also said her son was left-handed and had called his girlfriend to tell her he would contact her from jail. She wondered how police could find a bag of marijuana and not find a gun when they searched her son. There have been several protests in Jonesboro by citizens who don't believe the police explanation. Police have released a video in which an officer dramatizes how someone could shoot themselves while in the back of a police car. The officer was the same height and build as Carter, police said. They also have released the interview room video of a witness who said police were standing outside the car when a shot was fired. The autopsy also showed that Chavis Carter tested positive for marijuana, amphetamines (including meth) and benzodiazepines, classified by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration as depressants. Jonesboro police said the investigation into Carter's death is ongoing.","Crime lab concludes suspect shot himself in right temple .

"(OPRAH.com) -- One of the small sorrows of my adult life is being married to a man who won't eat tongue. ""It's delicious,"" I tell him, but he won't budge. ""If you tasted it and didn't know what it was, you'd love it,"" I say. ""The problem is all in your head!"" ""So?"" he says, perfectly content with his head and its problems. ""I'm still not eating it."" Undeterred, I describe the excitement I felt as a kid when I'd lift the lid on my mom's big frying pan and spy a beef tongue cooking there. ""It was curled -- you know, like that Rolling Stones logo,"" I say, ""only brownish gray, and covered in cream of mushroom soup, and, um...."" I realize I'm not making headway. Tongue is a hard sell to someone who has already placed it firmly outside his own personal sphere of comfort. We all have versions of these spheres, into which we segregate the edible from the inedible. Culture and ethnicity play a huge part in what winds up inside them (we do not eat monkey; the Penan of Borneo do), as do our parents and friends, advertising, politics, religion, our anxieties, and life experiences. It's no wonder each person in the Western world (where we have so much choice about what to eat) probably defines ""edible"" in a slightly different way. Our individual menus are as unique as our fingerprints. Oprah.com: One woman explores the virtues of eating everything . Take my friend Maria Ricapito. She is an adventuresome cook who is utterly incapable of eating an egg if the white and yellow aren't combined. She can eat omelets and scrambled eggs. But fried eggs? Deviled eggs? Hard-boiled eggs chopped up in potato salad? ""I can't even choke them down,"" she says, her voice taking on a tinge of hysteria. ""Something about the texture -- you know how the yolks are kind of crumbly and the whites sort of rubbery and solid? It just doesn't work for me at all."" No one starts out life with an aversion to eggs or tongue-- or, for that matter, to liver, okra, lima beans, or any of the dozens of other foods many people come to revile as adults. Indeed, according to Paul Rozin, Ph.D., professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert in disgust and food choice, there are only a handful of flavors our brains are hardwired to reject, and all are typical of foods that historically had a high likelihood of making us sick -- spoiled things like moldy bread and sour milk, and bitter things like caffeine. ""A lot of natural plant toxins are bitter,"" he says. In addition to this self-protective mechanism, there are two other universal, built-in predilections: First, a suspicion of (yet interest in) unfamiliar foods. And second, the ability to connect something new we ate to certain consequences, such as nausea. Oprah.com: What happens when anxiety controls your diet . That's it. ""Everything else is acquired,"" according to Elizabeth Capaldi, PhD, provost of Arizona State University and a longtime professor of the psychology of eating. ""There's no inborn dislike for any other taste or smell, even of vomit or feces."" In other words, you can't blame genes when you pick the anchovies off your pizza. So where do we acquire our vast range of idiosyncratic dislikes? ""Their origin is obscure,"" says Rozin. He admits that we generally grow to dislike foods that remind us of our bodily functions, guts, or mortality -- which might explain why liver (and other mealy, pasty foods) and oysters (and other squishy, slimy foods) put off so many people. Oprah.com: What you need to know about the meat you buy . It might even account for Maria's egg issue. She half-recalls overhearing as a child that eggs were chicken embryos, a thought that disturbed her in a way she still can't quite explain without turning green. Says Capaldi, ""Sometimes an idea produces an emotional reaction, and the emotion produces a physiological reaction"" -- namely, nausea. This isn't hardwired self-protective ""disgust,"" but it may have somehow piggybacked on the same apparatus. As Capaldi says, ""The disgust mechanism is a very, very powerful thing. Putting something in your body is an intimate act."" Any revulsion you feel toward a food is magnified by the thought that it will become part of you. This apparatus occasionally goes haywire. In 2007 BBC Television chronicled the struggle of David Nunley, a strapping 28-year-old father of two, to overcome a lifelong inability to eat anything but cheese, chips, and white bread. After four weeks of therapy and nutritional counseling, he managed to add salad to his diet; hot food still made him gag. Oprah.com: How to eat in your 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and beyond . You don't have to be as compulsive as Nunley to feel similar dread. History is full of stories of ordinary people who refused to eat unfamiliar food. The first colonists to America faced this predicament, myths of the first Thanksgiving to the contrary. They ""had come upon a land of plenty,"" according to Eating in America, by Waverley Root and Richard de Rochemont. ""They nearly starved in it."" Why? Because among other things, they ""could not or would not adapt themselves to the foods available locally...and elected instead to depend on supplies from England."" Close to death, many awaited shipments of English beef rather than swallow a morsel of lobster or a clam. The few among them who trusted the natives eventually provided a bridge to these strange new forms of sustenance. It sounds perverse, until you consider what you would do if you washed up on the shores of Cheju island and were offered a meal of sautéed silkworm pupae. You, too, might bide your time, hoping for a box of Cap'n Crunch to float in on the waves. Oprah.com: The innovative spirit of vegan cooking . Yet, clearly, diets aren't set in stone. We constantly add new things -- goji berries, lemongrass, Splenda -- and reject others -- chicken nuggets, say, after seeing Food, Inc. ""You can think yourself into an aversion,"" says Capaldi. And most of the time, you can think yourself out of one. Fuchsia Dunlop did. The English author of two Chinese cookbooks and a memoir, Shark's Fin and Sichuan Pepper, she went to great pains to get past her revulsion to some of the foods she was fed in China -- including goose intestines, pig brain, scorpions, bee larvae, and tendons from cows' throats, which she describes as ""just like rubber bands."" Because the Chinese truly relish these foods, she wanted to learn to like them, too. It helped to realize that Chinese cuisine, which has been evolving for thousands of years, celebrates variety in textures -- slimy, chewy, gelatinous, crunchy -- the way French cuisine champions complexity in flavor. ""In China, the sensation of a thing in your mouth is part of the pleasure of eating it,"" says Fuchsia. ""In the West, if you get a bit of cartilage in your mouth, it's the rubbish, but in China it's the good part. It's fun to try negotiating your way through a chicken wing with your teeth and tongue."" Oprah.com: What's the right diet for you? Take the quiz! Still, she admits that overcoming certain aversions required an iron will. Take ""thousand-year-old eggs,"" made by submerging raw duck eggs for three months in a brew of ash, lime, tea, and salt. ""The white turns into brownish jelly, and the yolk is a dark creamy thing edged in moldy green-gray."" At first Fuchsia found them revolting, but now she eats them with abandon, having decided to ""think of them as the egg equivalent of blue cheese."" I can't say how I'd react if served a thousand-year-old-egg, but, like Fuchsia, I see aversions as obstacles worth fighting to overcome. I've been this way since I was a kid and vowed to taste an olive and an oyster every year until I grew to like them -- an outcome I had utter faith in. But I must confess that my tolerance for odd foods sometimes makes me intolerant of other people's aversions to them, and that's not fair. Much as I'd like to coerce my husband into eating delicious, slow-cooked beef tongue, I have to accept that only he can decide what to him is delicious, and what remains banished forever to the land of utter yuck.

"(CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration is in the process of firing six checked-baggage screeners and suspending 14 others at Boston's Logan International Airport. The workers were all responsible for screening baggage in one of the 10 screening rooms in the airport, a TSA spokesperson who could not be identified due to the sensitivity of personnel actions told CNN. The six people the agency has proposed firing did not always send bags that needed a secondary screening to agents in another room to perform those inspections, the spokesperson said. TSA behavior detection officers retrained after profiling complaints . The 14 workers, including two managers, who the agency proposed suspending allegedly did not pay complete attention to the screening machines. They allegedly read newspapers or talked on the phone while they worked, or did not report the behavior. The suspensions are slated to last three to 14 days and will be unpaid. The alleged misconduct was discovered by a routine internal review, and additional investigations showed it was not happening in the other baggage inspection rooms at the airport, the spokesperson said. ""All TSA employees are held to the highest standards of conduct and accountability. These standards are critical to our work and TSA's commitment to the safety of the traveling public,"" read a TSA statement provided to CNN by another agency spokesman, David Castelveter. No security incidents were found related to any of the bags that should have been physically inspected, and the first agency spokesperson noted there are additional layers of security besides the inspections. The employees recommended for termination or suspension have the right to appeal under TSA employment rules. Those who complete a suspension will undergo retraining. TSA agents assigned to a behavior detection unit in Boston were ordered to undergo intensive retraining after allegations earlier this month that they were targeting minorities for questioning based on their race or ethnicity.

"New York (CNN) -- The man who pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree vehicular manslaughter after driving a speedboat into a barge on the Hudson River, killing a bride-to-be and her fiance's best man, was sentenced to two years in jail Tuesday, prosecutors said. Jojo John, 36, was piloting a 19-foot Stingray powerboat around 10:40 p.m. on July 26, 2013, when it slammed into one of three construction barges strapped together near the Tappan Zee Bridge, 25 miles north of Manhattan, hurling Lindsey Stewart and Mark Lennon into the river, resulting in their deaths, according to court documents. John's blood alcohol level was found to be 0.15, nearly twice the legal limit of .08, and ""cocaine metabolites"" were found in his system, prosecutors said. ""The defendant's reckless decision to drive a speedboat while under the influence of alcohol and drugs tragically caused the untimely deaths of two innocent people,"" Rockland County District Attorney Thomas Zugibe said in a statement. ""The sentence imposed today is more than justified,"" Zugibe said, adding that two years in Rockland County jail will give John ""time to reflect on his thoughtless actions."" John and four others, including groom-to-be Brian Bond, were injured. John was arrested while recovering from his injuries at Nyack Hospital. Stewart and Bond were to be married two weeks later, according to family, with Lennon as best man.

"(CNN) -- The recently merged Continental and United Airlines canceled 24 flights Wednesday due to pilot sick calls, which occurred as United Continental Holdings is negotiating a collective bargaining agreement with the pilots, an airline spokeswoman said. The airlines, which merged last year to become the world's largest carrier, said the sick calls began Tuesday, largely impacting the airports in New York and Newark, New Jersey, said airline spokeswoman Megan McCarthy. The Air Line Pilots Association didn't have an immediate comment Wednesday, but last month, the association said much work remains before the merger could be considered a success. The association and the merged airlines are in contract negotiations. Capt. Wendy Morse, chairman of the United Master Executive Council of the Air Line Pilots Association, made that remark as shareholders gathered for an annual United Airlines meeting.

"(CNN) -- Tree poaching conjures up the lawless Amazon jungle, but America's magnificent redwood forests now face a piecemeal but steady assault by poachers too, California officials say. Thieves are cutting massive chunks from the base of the champion trees, which are the tallest on Earth and are up to 2,000 years old. While state officials say the damage is far from any Amazonian deforestation, they do rank the desecration alongside elephant tusk poaching. Under the cloak of darkness, bandits are poaching the burl from the old-growth redwoods in Redwood National and State Parks in California, and that lumpy feature from the tree base is then sold for thousands of dollars to make furniture, bowls and even souvenirs, officials say. ""We've seen a peaked increase (of theft and damage),"" says Candace Tinkler, chief of interpretation and education at the park. ""Unfortunately I feel that it's more than we can keep track of."" Tinkler compares the theft to elephants being killed for their ivory tusks. She has been with the parks for three years and has noticed a spike in thefts during her tenure, she said. ""The distribution goes beyond what we could have imagined. There's a black market for this stuff, and it goes well beyond California borders,"" she said Tuesday. What makes the poaching so distressing is that the burls are crucial to the survival of the redwoods, whose towering forests block out the sun and draw tourists worldwide. When a burl cutting occurs, a lot of the bark is damaged or removed, and that bark is critical to protecting the redwoods from insect infestation and fire because the material is flame-resistant, Tinkler said. ""When you take away the burl and leave an open scar, it's similar to me having a major cut on my leg and I left it exposed,"" Tinkler explained. ""Now I'm exposed to other infections."" To combat the poachers, officials at Redwood National and State Parks in northern California have closed an eight-mile drive through the forests at night. The California Department of Parks and Recreation said smaller pieces of poached burl can sell for hundreds of dollars, and the larger chunks can fetch thousands. Taking the burls from a state park is a crime, and their size determines whether the crime is a misdemeanor or felony, the Humboldt County district attorney's office said. The burls provide unique and beautiful patterns for coffee tables and bar counter tops, and smaller pieces can be used for knife handles. But such a defacement of a forest distresses rangers. Redwoods are on many 'bucket lists' The Redwood National and State Parks comprises 133,000 acres of forest, coastlines, prairies, rivers and streams. Approximately 40,000 acres are old-growth forest and are a big draw for international visitors who consider a drive through the park a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Ranger Mike Poole, who works in the public information office at the park, receives numerous calls every week asking about the redwoods, located along the California coast north of San Francisco. ""One of the things I hear a lot is 'seeing the redwoods is on my bucket list,'"" Poole said. That's why protecting and preserving these behemoth beauties is a mission that rangers take very seriously at the park, which the United Nations labels a World Heritage site. ""We're one of those places that we have around the world that everyone thinks is precious enough, important enough, rare enough, that we need to protect it for the future,"" Tinkler said. ""It's not just a crime against us as Americans... it's a crime to everyone."" CNN's Michael Martinez and Paul Gunther contributed to this report.","In darkness, poachers cut the burl from the base of redwoods in California .

"(CNN) -- As the sun sets over Seattle, Phoenix Jones straps on his bodysuit and pulls a black and yellow mask over his face. He is getting ready to venture into the night, looking for anyone who may be breaking the law. The 25 year old is not a policeman with a quirky dress sense, but one of the most prominent members of the real-life-superhero community, a movement of people who wear costumes inspired by comic book characters, trying to prevent crimes in their area. Jones patrols Seattle's more troubled neighborhoods five nights a week with his group, the Rain City Superhero Movement. His wider network, The Alliance, has 34 members across the United States, London and Dubai. His decision to become a real-life caped crusader came after his car was broken into, and his young son was hurt by the shattered glass. He said: ""I decided to actively fight crime and threw myself completely into it. After my experience I just felt there was so much apathy around and wanted to do something to make my community safer."" The masked adventurer has been voted Belltown Neighborhood Hero by Seattle Magazine readers' choice poll, and has been documented as stopping a car from being broken into with his group. An unorthodox superhero . Jones, whose day job is teaching autistic children life skills, says he didn't read many comic books when he was young, because he couldn't identify with the heroes. ""It never appealed to me,"" he said. ""For example Batman, he was this billionaire living in a mansion and I was just a broke kid."" Then, at 14, he came across a little-known character called Nightwing who worked as a waiter during the day, and fought crime at night, and was hooked. ""I fell in love with this idea, that you don't need to have a lot of money to go out there and make a difference,"" he said. Read more: At 75, is Superman over the hill? Jones doesn't tackle criminals unprepared. He is a former mixed martial arts fighter, and wears a $10,000 bulletproof, Kevlar reinforced, fire-retardant jumpsuit, made with D3L smart fabric which hardens on impact. His superhero activities landed him in trouble in 2011, when he was arrested for pepper spraying people outside a bar in Seattle. Jones said he was trying to break up a fight, and he was later released without charge. Helping abuse victims . The so-called ""Guardian of Seattle"" is married to fellow superhero Purple Reign, who uses her hero persona to raise awareness of domestic violence. She said: ""I was in an abusive relationship, and a lot of people around me noticed but said nothing. Now I want to inspire others to be heroes and stop minding their own business when they see abuse, as well as speak up for victims who have not yet found their voice.""

Her campaigning earned her the University of Washington Women of Courage honor last November. Purple Reign says her superhero name represents the transformation she underwent from a victim to survivor of domestic abuse. ""Purple is a color which is very often used in domestic abuse awareness campaigns, and reign comes from the fact that I now reign over my own life,"" she said. ""Wearing the suit has helped me feel more confident and in control, and move on from my past. I am not a victim any more, I feel powerful.""

"(CNN) -- British Airways confirmed the emergency landing of an A321 last month after the pilots complained of feeling lightheaded and put on their own oxygen masks. The flight bound for Glasgow, Scotland, on December 20 returned to London's Heathrow Airport shortly after takeoff, said airline spokesman Richard Goodfellow. Airline engineers checked the aircraft after landing and dismissed the possibility of contaminated air in the cockpit, Goodfellow said. He would not comment on the cause of the incident while an national investigation is ongoing but said, ""We believe it was an isolated incident."" Reports of the incident surfaced over the weekend in the British press after passengers apparently posted details on a flight-oriented website. A senior flight attendant was called to the flight deck about 20 minutes after takeoff and alerted by the pilots that they were using their emergency oxygen supply, Goodfellow said, disputing reports that the pilots needed flight attendant assistance to put on the oxygen. ""The pilots followed the flight procedures they were highly trained for, and the flight landed without incident,"" he said. After a safe landing, the 116 passengers were placed on a new flight with an entirely new crew, he said. The pilots were examined by an airline doctor but were not hospitalized. The plane was returned to service.","Pilots on a December flight felt ill and put on their oxygen masks .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- The Dalai Lama has formally relinquished his political and administrative powers, a spokesman said Tuesday. The Tibetan spiritual leader approved amendments to the exiled constitution to enable him to devolve his political responsibilities into the community's elected leadership and judiciary, according to officials. Lobsang Choedak, a spokesman for the exiled Tibetan government, said the changes were carried out during a three-day session of its parliament in the Himalayan town of Dharamsala, India. The Dalai Lama approved them Sunday. The amendments came after a special assembly of Tibetans urged the Dalai Lama to reconsider his decision to cede his ceremonial powers, a plea he rejected, Choedak said. Lobsang Sangay, who was elected head of Tibet's government-in-exile last month, now fills the shoes of the Dalai Lama as ""head of state,"" Choedak said. But the Dalai Lama remains the spiritual leader of the global Tibetan community. In March, the Dalai Lama announced his plan to retire as political head of the Tibetan exile movement, saying the community needed an elected leader ""to whom I can devolve power."" ""The essence of a democratic system is, in short, the assumption of political responsibility by elected leaders for the popular good,"" he said in his March message to Tibet's parliament-in-exile. ""In order for our process of democratization to be complete, the time has come for me to devolve my formal authority to such an elected leadership.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The nation's major airlines -- lambasted for years because of canceled flights, long tarmac delays, late arrivals and lost luggage -- have significantly improved in all four of those key measurements of customer service, the federal government said Thursday. Indeed, airlines set an 18-year record for on-time performance during the first half of this year, a report by the Department of Transportation said. And lengthy tarmac delays have decreased dramatically. The 586 lengthy tarmac delays recorded during the first half of 2009 dropped to four delays for the same time period this year. Alaska Airlines: Note on wing 'not the best approach' The improvements are ""very good news,"" said Kate Hanni of Flyersrights.org, a passenger advocacy group that fought for rules penalizing carriers for tarmac delays. ""We said that our tarmac rules were going to force efficiency, and that's what we think is happening,"" Hanni said. ""I think the weather has something to do with it as well, in all fairness,"" she said. Airlines also have worked to improve customer satisfaction, Hanna said. ""I think they realized they hit a bottom and they realized their customers wouldn't take any more abuse."" In a statement, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood also credited the new DOT rules. ""Our new airline consumer rules and our vigorous oversight of the aviation industry are holding airlines accountable to their customers,"" LaHood said. An airline trade group heralded the report. ""Our member airlines are delivering levels of customer service that no other industry, given its complexity, matches and are working to make air travel even more efficient for passengers and shippers,"" Nicholas Calio of Airlines for America said in a statement. The improved service, interestingly, has not resulted in fewer complaints to the DOT. Instead, complaints rose 24% during the first half of 2012, the report says. A DOT spokesman said the department has seen an ""uptick"" in complaints when there's a lot of publicity about airline consumer issues, such as January when many of the provisions of the new airline consumer rule took effect. Industry officials say the complaints may be on the rise because the DOT has made it easier to file grievances, and because passengers may be complaining about factors not covered by the DOT report, such as rising ticket prices, cramped seating and baggage fees. Plane lands at wrong airport in West Virginia . The DOT may see another uptick when a new requirement takes effect requiring airlines to publish the DOT toll-free hotline number on web sites and e-tickets. The DOT's Air Travel Consumer Report released Thursday says: . -- The 15 largest U.S. airlines had an 83.7% on-time arrival rate during the first six months of the year, the highest mark for any January-June period in the 18 years the department has collected comparable data. -- Airlines canceled 1.1% of flights, also the lowest rate for the past 18 years. -- There were only four tarmac delays longer than three hours on domestic flights during the six-month period. This follows the department's rule, which took effect in April 2010, setting a three-hour limit for aircraft carrying passengers on domestic flights to sit on the tarmac. In contrast, there were 586 lengthy tarmac delays between January and June of 2009, the year before the tarmac rule went into effect. -- Airlines posted the lowest rate of mishandled baggage for the period since the data was first reported in September 1987. The record of 2.97 reports of mishandled baggage per 1,000 passengers improved on the previous January-June then-record low of 3.60 set last year. There were other measurements that, though small in number, put airline customer service in a negative light. The DOT received 344 complaints about airlines' treatment of disabled passengers during the six-month period, up 20.7% from the comparable period in 2011. And airlines bumped -- involuntarily denied boarding -- to 0.98 per 10,000 passengers, up from a 0.80 rate in the first half of 2011.

"Washington (CNN) -- Transportation Security Administration officials are investigating an incident this week in which a traveler apparently unintentionally picked up the wrong bag and boarded an airplane -- not knowing the bag had a gun belonging to an armed pilot. Thursday morning's incident at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport resulted in the delay of two flights, the hourlong closure of an airport checkpoint and an ongoing TSA investigation, officials said. The gun belonged to a JetBlue Airways pilot who was authorized to carry it under the TSA's Federal Flight Deck Officer program, which trains airline pilots in the use of handguns and authorizes them to use them in jet cockpits to deter hijackers. The firearm ""was properly secured in a fashion that rendered it incapable of being discharged,"" TSA spokesman Nick Kimball said. Persons familiar with the investigation said a woman apparently picked up the bag at the airport gate and boarded a flight to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, while the pilot who owned the bag was getting on his flight to Pittsburgh. Before her plane departed, the woman realized she had the wrong bag and gave it to the plane's flight crew, who looked inside and saw the pilot's identification. While the exact circumstances are unclear, a source said, the bag was returned to JetBlue, and it was found to contain the pilot's firearm. At that point, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey police were contacted, the source said. A JetBlue spokeswoman Jenny Dervin said two flights were delayed about an hour because of the mix-up and that another pilot was assigned to fly the plane to Pittsburgh to avoid further delay. The TSA said Friday the pilot ""has been relieved of his firearm"" pending the investigation. Pilots who join the TSA program do so voluntarily, and are not compensated by the government for their security services. In 2008, a US Airways pilot was fired after accidentally discharging his handgun in the cockpit while a plane was flying at 8,000 feet on approach to Charlotte, North Carolina. The bullet penetrated the fuselage but did not damage any crucial instruments or wiring. The incident apparently occurred while the pilot was attempting to secure the gun during the fight's landing phase, which was in violation of TSA rules. CNN producer Mike M. Ahlers contributed to this report.","Woman picks up wrong bag with gun belonging to pilot, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Hurricane Irene has come and gone, but many travelers are still going nowhere fast in the aftermath of the storm. The airlines are just recovering after canceling thousands of flights over the weekend, some mass transit systems are still struggling, and train service remains sporadic in parts of the Northeast ravaged by Irene. The problems created a ripple effect throughout the country, with fliers who were trying to get into the region also encountering frustrating delays. ""We got to go to work. How are we going to do that? Now we're thinking of driving to New Jersey because we can't stay here all this time,"" said Bridget Corg, who was trying to return home from Miami, CNN affiliate WSVN reported. ""I'm ready to go so I can go to work. Get to the airport, cancellation,"" said Jerry Delerme, who was trying to fly to New York from south Florida. ""I'm flying standby, so that means I'm not getting home probably until (Tuesday)."" It will take a few days for everyone to get where they want to go, said Mateo Leras, a spokesman for JetBlue. The airline is adding several flights Monday to take care of passengers who couldn't fly over the weekend. Airlines and airports getting back to normal . About 650,000 to 700,000 air travelers have been grounded since Friday because of flight cancellations prompted by Hurricane Irene, said Daniel Baker, CEO of FlightAware.com, a flight tracking service. The good news is that many of the affected passengers made alternate arrangements, so not everyone is in the backlog that carriers are dealing with now, Baker added. ""The airlines are hoping to be back on a regular schedule this afternoon, and so at least the cancellations will dwindle down,"" Baker said. ""But it will be through the week"" before the backlog is resolved, he said. ""There's no question that there's really widespread ramifications."" Did Irene affect you? Share photos, video, but stay safe . Airlines are urging passengers to check their flight status before leaving for the airport. Those who are stuck and must pay out-of-pocket to stay at a hotel should go online and look for some great last-minute rates, said Anne Banas, executive editor at SmarterTravel. She recommended checking Hotels.com or downloading the Hotel Tonight smartphone app for a list of same-day deals. ""You can also sometimes call a local hotel and ask for a 'distressed travelers rate.' Usually it's a discount they offer in situations like these, when there are storms and people can't get out of town,"" Banas said. ""Doesn't always work."" But there's hope stranded fliers will see an improvement soon. Tuesday and Wednesday are usually the slowest air travel days of the week, which will help travelers get on the flights they want, said Todd Lehmacher, a spokesman for US Airways. The airline reached out to 90,000 people ahead of the weekend to reschedule their itineraries, he said. Most passengers were accommodated before the storm began, American Airlines spokeswoman Andrea Huguely said. The carrier is considering extra flights if there's a lot of overflow and demand, she said. Airlines including American and US Airways said they don't expect any impact on Labor Day travel. ""This is a well-prepared(-for) and well-planned event,"" Baker said. ""The airlines announced it really well, they canceled flights, and they're getting back going again. ... It comes off as very organized."" Still, some travelers abroad are having trouble coming back to the United States. CNN's Deborah Feyerick, who has been traveling in Greece, was supposed to return to New York on Sunday, but the first flight on which her airline could rebook her was Thursday. Australian traveler Shaun Cunningham is stranded in Costa Rica. He was supposed to fly back to London via New York, but his travel agent told him he wouldn't be able to take that route until September 10. So Cunningham paid 1,200 pounds for a one-way ticket that connects via a different country, allowing him to fly out sooner. Meanwhile, train travel is still feeling the impact of Hurricane Irene. All Amtrak service between Boston and Philadelphia is canceled because of the extensive flooding, debris on tracks and power issues due to the storm. There's also no Acela Express service between Boston and Washington. New Jersey rail service is suspended until further notice, but bus and light rail service is operating on a modified schedule on Monday. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority has suspended a number of regional rail lines.","An estimated 650,000 to 700,000 air travelers have been grounded since Friday .

"(CNN) -- The three Iranian security officers rang the doorbell, politely informed the man of his arrest, thoroughly searched the house, confiscated high-tech gear and books, and whisked him away to the nation's notorious Evin Prison. The early Sunday morning raid took three hours. Now, every second seems like an eternity for the man's anguished family members, praying for his physical safety, hoping for his release, and getting their heads around the prospect of a long stint in prison, his relatives told CNN. His family says the reason for his arrest is his religion. The man is one of 16 Baha'is swept away in raids on or after May 21 targeting educators dedicated to teaching members of their community who are denied entry to universities in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Of those 16, nine have since been released. But this educator remains in prison, a Baha'i official told CNN. The crackdown is the latest example of the Shiite Muslim regime's relentless persecution of those who adhere to a faith deemed heretical by the ruling ayatollahs. The Baha'i faith, founded during the 19th century in Iran and now with 5 million to 6 million adherents worldwide, is a monotheistic religion that focuses on the spiritual unity of humanity. The clerics who hold sway in Iran regard the Baha'i faith as blasphemous because its founder, Bahá'u'lláh, declared himself to be a prophet of God. Muslims believe the Prophet Mohammed was the last prophet of God. Iranian security officials in Tehran, Karaj, Isfahan and Shiraz raided as many as 30 homes of Baha'is who were part of the Baha'i Institute of Higher Education, or BIHE, established in 1987 to help their co-religionists get undergraduate and graduate degrees. More than a dozen people were arrested in the raids, the most sweeping against the education initiative since 1998. ""The BIHE university was a cover for the propagation of the Baha'i faith and was used to trap citizens in the Baha'i spy network and to gather information from within the county,"" the Iran Daily, an official government newspaper reported. ""Authorities have discovered Baha'i propaganda, CDs and books in the possession of those who have been arrested,"" according to the newspaper. The raids have drawn condemnation from the Baha'is and other voices, including the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an American government agency that monitors religious discrimination across the globe. ""The Iranian government will stop at nothing in its shameless persecution of the Baha'is in Iran,"" said the commission's chairman, Leonard Leo, in a written statement. ""It's not enough that authorities already have a policy in place preventing Baha'is from attending Iranian universities -- the government is now systematically trying to dismantle the Baha'i community's internal initiative to ensure that its youth have the opportunity to get an education beyond high school."" The 300,000-person Iranian Baha'i community has endured intensified persecution since the shah of Iran was toppled in 1979. Since the Islamic regime took power decades ago, the U.S. commission says, 200 Baha'i leaders in Iran have been killed, more than 10,000 have been dismissed from government and university jobs, and followers are forbidden to ""establish places of worship, schools, or any independent religious associations in Iran."" They are ""denied government jobs and pensions as well as the right to inherit property. Their marriages and divorces also are not recognized, and they have difficulty obtaining death certificates. Baha'i cemeteries, holy places, and community properties are often seized or desecrated,"" the commission says. Baha'i spokesman Farhad Sabetan, who teaches economics at California State University, East Bay, said that while Baha'is are not allowed to serve as military officers, they were recruited to serve as low-level privates in the Iran-Iraq war. And since 2005, around 400 Baha'is have been jailed arbitrarily, the U.S. commission said, including seven of the community leaders seized three years ago. ""It reminds one of what Hitler wanted to do prior to the extermination,"" Sabetan said. That is a reference to the persecution and genocide of Jews under Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime in Germany in the 20th century. As Baha'is were systemically banned from higher education, they developed the underground-style institute. Sabetan said that the thinking had been, ""Why can't we just start something ourselves?"" At first the classes were correspondence courses. Others were held in private homes, where dental students stood over kitchen sinks in denture-making lessons. ""It became a grass-roots homegrown development."" No one bothered the students and teachers at first as the group amassed volunteers, equipment and willing students. Its faculty comprised volunteer professionals who once taught in Iran but lost their jobs after the revolution because they are Baha'is. But about 10 years later, the crackdowns started. The power plays made no sense to Baha'is and seemed like oppression for oppression's sake. Sabetan said one teacher told him that security officers ""destroyed everything"" in a raid and didn't even have the good sense to confiscate the material for their own use. With the help of funding from foreign Baha'i organizations, the system grew and is now a virtual online college. The effort is a serious initiative to help Iranian Baha'is gain the right qualifications for trades and professions and the bachelor's degrees issued by the school have been accepted by some Western colleges, the Baha'is say on their website. The Baha'i educational network offers over 20 associate, undergraduate and graduate degrees in a range of subjects from literature and law to math and pharmacy, the website says. Sabetan said he doesn't know what compelled the authorities to carry out the latest raids, but at least one of the people has been charged with acts against the security of the regime. ""It's not clear to us how the study of physics, chemistry and science endanger the Iranian government,"" Sabetan said. The professor seized in the Sunday, May 22 raid typified the faculty, according to his wife and daughter in Iran. They did not want to be named for security reasons. His relatives said he was unpaid for his labors teaching math and economics to fellow Baha'is. The security officers told the teacher and his wife he would be held in Evin Prison's Ward 209. That's a section of the penitentiary said to be for political prisoners and run by intelligence officers. ""He was not paid or reimbursed for this work,"" his daughter told CNN. ""He did it out of love, love for teaching and love for his students. He wanted to give young people an education so they can have a good life and make something of themselves. It was his passion in life to educate others."" After the three security officers, armed with a warrant, walked in the Baha'i man's house, the man quickly told his wife that the police had arrived. ""Please put your veil on, your brothers have come,"" a phrase meant to show respect to the police of the Shiite regime, which expect women cover their heads. The officers explained that they would be looking through the family's personal belongings. While the wife accepted that, she insisted that she accompany them; the officials let her. ""I couldn't just sit down and let men sort through my home. I told them, 'This is my house.' I couldn't just stand to the side,"" she told CNN. The men were respectful, she said. They didn't destroy material or ransack the house. But they seized memory cards from cameras, mobile phones, computer hard drives and books on the faith and university. Before the father was taken away, he told his wife not to worry, saying the authorities will realize he didn't do anything wrong. But his relatives and the Baha'i community are worried that interrogators attempting wider clampdowns will try to pry names of other teachers and students out of the arrested teachers. Before one unsuccessful effort to visit him at the prison last week, his wife said, ""God willing, I will be able to see him tomorrow and he will be released. I am positive about this because he did not do anything wrong and he is a good person.""","The Baha'i faith, founded in Iran, is considered blasphemous there .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two years after the terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, many Republicans still have unanswered questions about security issues related to the incident. Many Democrats say that after dozens of hearings, briefings, probes and reports on the subject, this latest committee could amount to nothing more than a fishing expedition. One thing both parties agreed on at Wednesday's first hearing of the latest inquiry - the new House Benghazi Select Committee- was that substantial security improvements by the State Department and an eye to the lessons of the past are necessary to prevent future American deaths. The September 11, 2012, attack left U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods dead, and immediately sparked controversy, with Republicans accusing the Obama administration of mishandling the attack and manipulating the talking points used to discuss it for political reasons. Numerous investigations into the attack have been championed on the right by media organizations and by Republicans, including former presidential candidate Mitt Romney and House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa. The goal of this latest committee -- the House Benghazi Select Committee -- is to ""produce the final, definitive accounting on behalf of Congress of what happened before, during and after the terrorist attacks on our facilities in Benghazi,"" according to committee Communications Director Jamal D. Ware. Wednesday's hearing, titled ""Implementation of the Accountability Review Board (ARB) Recommendations"" -- a topic the committee spokesman said was selected by Democrats -- was aimed at examining the steps being taken to implement a series of proposals to make sure high threat diplomatic posts get the security they need. Gregory Starr, Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security, Mark J. Sullivan, Former Director of the United States Secret Service and Todd Keil, former assistant secretary for infrastructure protection at the Department of Homeland Security testified before the committee. Related: Clinton supporters launch counter-attack on Benghazi claims . ""Now is the time to clear the smoke, remove the mirrors. Now is the time for the Department of State to finally institutionalize some real, meaningful and progressive change,"" Keil, also a member of the ARB's Independent Panel on Best Practices, said in his opening remarks. ""They can't lose this moment. Words and cursory actions by the Department of State ring hollow absent transparency and verifiable and sustainable actions."" Past recommendations ignored? Keil, Select Committee Chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) and other members said too often the recommendations made after a security failure have been ignored. Gowdy cited proposals presented after the Beirut embassy bombing in 1983 and the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. ""It is stunning to see the similarities between the recommendations made decades ago and the recommendations made by the Benghazi ARB and, if you doubt that, I want you to compare the recommendations of those made 25, a quarter of a century ago, 25 years ago, with the recommendations made by the Benghazi ARB,"" Gowdy said. ""We do not suffer from a lack of recommendations. We do suffer from a lack of implementing and enacting those recommendations and that has to end."" Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee who has accused Republicans of politicizing the Benghazi attack, said his goal was to focus on reform efforts and to learn from past tragedies. Cummings called the attack a ""transformational moment"" -- a comment later echoed by Keil and Republican members. Related: War against ISIS - What does Rand Paul's 'yes' mean? One high-energy exchange between Ohio Republican Jim Jordan and Keil focused one of the Best Practices Panel's 40 recommendations that the State Department create a new post -- undersecretary for diplomatic security, to help make sure one designated official would be accountable for security. Keil said that was the panel's top recommendation. ""In our executive summary we said one clear and overarching recommendation is crucial to the successful and sustainable implementation of all the recommendations in this report is the creation of an undersecretary,"" Keil said. State has declined to implement that recommendation, even though it is similar to one made after the East Africa embassy bombings, Keil said. Jordan slammed the agency's track record. ""What's it going to take for the State Department to put in place the practices that will save American lives?"" he asked. ""They didn't follow their own standards that were developed in 1983 after the Beirut embassy bombing. They didn't follow the waiver policy to deviate from those standards and now they're not following the Best Practices Panel's number 1 recommendation. What's it going to take?"" Starr said the department looked at the recommendation very seriously and decided what was most important was that he had direct access to the secretary. ""I am directly reportable to the secretary for security threat information and security threats against our people,"" he said. Starr said a good deal of progress had been made in implementing other recommendations to mitigate the risk to US personnel in dangerous places. ""Like you, we want to keep our people safe,"" said Starr in his opening testimony, but he also warned that ""While we can do everything we can to reduce the risk, we can never eliminate it fully."" Sullivan, who was also chairman of the Independent Panel on Best Practices, said better communication, planning and logistics and risk management might have helped prevent the deaths in Benghazi and said improvements were being made in each of those areas. Starr and Keil raised questions about whether U.S. personnel even need to be stationed in dangerous places and said there must be a risk-management process in place to answer that key question in each instance. ""We need to ask the question, why are we in the most dangerous places?"" Starr said. ""And the 30 places that we identified as the highest threat, highest risk, that's exactly what we're doing, going through every single one of those 30 and doing this vital presence validation process. The first step is, what is our national interest for being there?""","A new Benghazi Select Committee got under way on Capitol Hill .

"Washington (CNN) -- Eight federal air marshals are being fired for drinking alcohol during training, and six others are being disciplined for not reporting it, according to the Transportation Security Administration. The marshals, who typically fly with guns to protect commercial flights, were in New York in February for training and were not scheduled to fly that day. The group, which included one supervisor, went to lunch at a restaurant, where eight drank alcohol, TSA spokesman David Castelveter said. Some of the marshals had their weapons with them at the time. The incident was reported to an internal federal air marshal website by a marshal who was there, and the TSA launched an internal investigation, Castelveter explained. Under employment rules, seven of the agents will have a chance to appeal their terminations. One of the agents had recently been hired and was still on probationary status and so was fired immediately. ""TSA holds all of its employees to the highest professional and ethical standards and has zero tolerance for misconduct in the workplace,"" Castelveter said in a statement.

"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden headlined a small Catholic event Wednesday in Des Moines, Iowa, stoking speculation about his presidential aspirations. Biden used most of his speech to tout Nuns on the Bus, a group of liberal Catholic nuns who convey their message of social justice on road trips. But his praise for the group came in the form of stressing likely Democratic issues in the midterm elections: the importance of health care and growth of the middle class. ""This nation is stronger when every voice is heard and everyone has a seat at the table,"" Biden said on the steps of the Iowa Capitol. ""Right now, only some of the voices are being heard, and as a result over the last couple of decades, things have gotten out of whack, folks."" Biden says use of 'offensive' term Shylock was a poor choice . To those in the audience, the presidential politics of the vice president's visit were obvious. Biden has admitted he is thinking about running for president, and a recent CNN/ORC International poll found that 15% of Iowa Democrats would like him to be the Democratic nominee in 2016. The vice president's trip comes on the heels of Hillary Clinton's much-talked about trip Sunday to the Harkin Steak Fry, the annual outdoor fund- raiser run by Sen. Tom Harkin. The visit was Clinton's most obvious step toward a presidential run since leaving the State Department in 2013. In the same CNN/ORC poll, 53% of Iowa Democrats favored the former secretary of state. ""Joe tells it like it is, and we are blessed to have him,"" said Craig Stark from Clive, Iowa, who said he hopes Biden runs in 2016. As for how he feels about Clinton, Stark said, ""Well, we don't have dynasties like Bush dynasties. ... To me we need new blood."" The crowd also featured some of Biden's most ardent supporters from his short-lived 2008 presidential campaign. ""Joe Biden knows how to tell the truth, whether it is the politically correct thing to say or not,"" said John Olsen, who proudly said he supported Biden in the 2008 caucuses. ""You will become a fan of Joe Biden if you ever get a chance to meet him. He is the most personal, down-to-earth, lovable guy."" Clinton's weekend visit was the first time she had been in Iowa since 2008, but Biden is no stranger to the Hawkeye State. The vice president last visited a year ago when he spoke at the Harkin Steak Fry, the most important annual event for Iowa Democrats that is widely seen as a must-stop for Democrats considering a run at the White House. ""It's amazing when you come to speak at the steak fry, a whole lot of people seem to take notice. I don't know why the hell that is,"" Biden joked then. ""You've attracted the entire national press corps here."" Biden has also made a point to acknowledge Iowa on a regular basis. Biden called John Lundell, the new mayor of Coralville, Iowa, to congratulate him on his victory in November. And in May, Biden stopped by a party of Iowans in Washington for a lobbying trip. Wednesday's speech was not Biden's only stop in Iowa. During his visit, the vice president did a rope-line photo session with supporters of local Democratic campaigns, including congressional ones, according to campaign sources in Iowa. The photo session was seen as a perk for supporting local Democrats. Biden's speech was the kickoff of the latest initiative from Nuns on the Bus in which the group will encourage voters in 36 cities along a 5,252-mile route to turn out and vote in the 2014 midterms. The vice president focused a great deal on what Democrats are talking about ahead of the election: the poor and middle class. ""Things are out of whack,"" Biden said about the tax system in the United States. ""It comes down to a simple question of fairness. Americans have always done best when we acted as one America. Because when we do, the nation succeeds"" He added: ""It is time for a fair tax structure ... one that values hard work as much as inherited wealth. ... It is time to close these tax loopholes, folks."" Nuns on the Bus was also active around the 2012 midterms. The group organized a multistate tour to bring attention to Rep. Paul Ryan's proposed budget cuts for Medicare and other social welfare programs. Sister Simone Campbell, executive director of the group behind the bus tour, told CNN that Biden's attendance was meant to encourage civic engagement but said the event was ""not partisan."" ""Right now, we are just doing what Pope Francis challenges us to do,"" Campbell said. ""He says the heart of the problems of our society and our world is inequality and what we have to do is respond to the needs of the poor and those who are left out."" Campbell didn't comment about Biden's presidential chances, but she said she had an idea about why he agreed to attend the Nuns on the Bus event. ""Every time I have seen him, he tells me that Catholic sisters help keep him Catholic,"" she said with a laugh. ""I think part of the reason he is coming is his own nourishment and his support of us.""","Vice President Joe Biden travels to Iowa, a key state in presidential campaigns .

"(CNN) -- It shouldn't be a surprise. An image of a woman holding her own, looking smart and strong in the workplace, is more inspiring than a photograph of a stressed female executive struggling with a briefcase and a howling baby. But at a presentation Wednesday at the Cannes Lions advertising festival in France, Facebook COO and Lean In founder Sheryl Sandberg, and Getty co-founder and CEO Jonathan Klein revealed what had spurred them to create the Lean In collection, a curated selection of Getty imagery that shows women in a more diverse light - and revealed why it's better for business. ""We still live in a world - and this is a shocker,"" Sandberg said wryly, ""but it's still overwhelmingly run by men. ""Less than six percent of CEOs in any country, including the [United States], are women."" ""There is huge cultural variety around the world,"" Sandberg continued, ""But the stereotypes of men and women are actually exactly the same. ""Men are told to lead, to be results focused. Women are told they should speak when spoken to. Little girls are called bossy, little boys are called leaders. ""As human beings when something surprises us, or goes against our expectations, we dislike it. So if we show images of women leading, we actually change this."" Klein said, ""There is nothing more powerful than an image that captures something in the moment ... that gets people to change their minds."" Stepping away from stereotypical images showing women in passive or objectifying situations, the collection offers alternative representations of women doing physical jobs, working in robotics, aging gracefully and - Sandberg said emphatically - ""not laughing eating salad."" The Lean in/Getty partnership, which launched in February, was greenlit by Sandberg when Getty's Pamela Grossman and Lean In's Jessica Bennett presented Getty findings that suggested commercial clients were starting to look for a broader representation of women to use in their creative. And it's working. Getty has seen sales of the images in the 2,500-strong collection -- all of which were previously available -- jump by 54%. ""I wish we could see that pattern repeated across the entire Getty archive,"" joked Klein. Lean In's push for a wider diversity of imagery in the media is part of a broader commercial trend towards a presentation of womanhood that's more reflective of the lives of real women. Sandberg, who attributes this to the appeal of authentic user-generated content on social media, highlighted the groundbreaking example of Dove's ""Real Beauty"" campaign, which celebrated a wide variety of female body types in addition to the lean silhouette traditionally favored by the media. She also pointed to more recent examples such as Pantene's ""Labels against Women"" viral hit, produced for P&G Pantene by BBD Guerrero, Manila, that highlighted the different words (""persuasive"" vs ""pushy,"" ""dedicated"" vs ""selfish"") applied to high achieving men and women. Campaigns such as these prove that a more representative approach that's less perfect and more reflective of a diverse, global audience can gain significant social traction - nirvana to advertising executives seeking the holy grail of ""earned social media"" - industry jargon for trusted consumer word-of-mouth endorsement. The Pantene Philippines advertisement's 46 million views boosted brand favorability, especially in women aged 18-24, and increased engagement with the brand by over four times, according to the agency. Its follow-up,""Not Sorry,"" which launched Wednesday also, leverages the success of the popular #sorrynotsorry hashtag and questions why women feel the need to constantly apologize. It's widely expected to repeat the success of its predecessor. Sandberg then challenged the audience of advertisers and agencies to reflect a more representative world in their creative, citing their potential reach. ""Bestselling books will sell two million copies,"" she said. ""The first Pantene advert got 46 million views. [The campaign will] have reached 40 million people by the time the [latest] campaign is done. ""We can show women with crying babies in briefcases or women hiding under their desks, or we can show women at their desks.""","A new collection of Getty Images curated in partnership with Lean In shows women in a more diverse light .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Billionaire Donald Sterling opposes his wife's effort to sell the couple's ownership of the Los Angeles Clippers for a record $2 billion because he was negotiating a big broadcast deal with Fox that would be worth more, he testified Tuesday. Sterling was asked by his wife's attorney whether he was fighting her proposed deal because he wanted to restore his dignity. ""The reason you are handling the case is because you want to charge millions in fees, right?"" Donald Sterling said in a probate court trial. ""The reason is not because of my dignity."" Sterling cited how another NBA franchise in Los Angeles -- the Lakers -- struck a deal with Time Warner Cable to broadcast its games for 20 years for a reported $3 billion in 2011. ""The reason is that the Lakers signed a deal with Warners for $3 billion. The reason is, I am negotiating with Fox,"" Sterling said. Fox representatives couldn't be immediately reached for comment Tuesday. Donald Sterling became tearful describing his wife as a wonderful person, but one who cannot run all the couple's corporations. ""My wife can't run anything. She is beautiful, she is intelligent. But she can't run these things. You think it's my ego?"" Donald Sterling said on the stand. Donald Sterling testified for the first time in a trial examining how his wife had him declared mentally incapacitated and then took over the couple's trust that owns the Clippers. Shelly Sterling is trying to sell the basketball team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, but Donald Sterling is opposing the proposed sale. The NBA ordered the couple to sell the team after Donald Sterling made racial slurs against African-Americans in an audio recording. Donald Sterling, an attorney, was combative on the stand at times, but he also had the entire courtroom laughing at least three times. The judge warned him he was a witness, and not a lawyer trying to control the courtroom. The trial, which began Monday, was continued until Wednesday. Donald Sterling will return to the witness stand at 1:30 p.m. PT. Shelly Sterling also was in the courtroom Tuesday. During an afternoon recess, Shelly Sterling approached her husband, and he gave her a kiss. She cried and then left the courtroom. She later returned. Earlier in the trial's second day, the attorneys for Donald Sterling cross-examined a physician who had certified Sterling as mentally incapacitated. The questioning of the doctor stopped when she needed to retrieve more of her notes. Dr. James Edward Spar, a second physician who examined Sterling and also certified him as similarly incapacitated, also took the stand Tuesday. He was asked to send more documents to Donald Sterling's legal team. A state judge in Los Angeles is hearing evidence on whether Shelly Sterling acted properly when she removed her husband from the couple's trust, in which they equally own the NBA franchise. Tuesday's proceeding began with testimony from Dr. Meril S. Platzer, a neurologist who was one of two physicians who examined Donald Sterling and certified him as being mentally incapacitated and unable to continue as trustee. A third physician reviewed those findings and endorsed their conclusions. Shelly Sterling took over the couple's trust after doctors made the determination about his mental state. Donald Sterling's lawyers say he was tricked into the medical examinations. They also dispute the assessment that their client is mentally deficient. Late last month, another doctor found Donald Sterling to be mentally fit, a source with knowledge of the situation told CNN. In court Monday, Platzer said she examined Donald Sterling on May 19 and found he is suffering from early stages of Alzheimer's and may have had it for three to five years. Platzer said in a May 29 certification that Donald Sterling has ""an impairment of his level of attention, information processing, short-term memory impairment and ability to modulate mood, emotional liability, and is at risk of making potentially serious errors of judgment,"" court papers said. Spar, a specialist in geriatric psychiatry who examined Donald Sterling on May 22, said Sterling suffers ""mild global cognitive impairment"" and ""the overall picture is consistent with early Alzheimer's disease, but could reflect other forms of brain disease,"" court papers said. Under the trust agreement, if Donald Sterling became mentally incapacitated, he would be removed as a trustee, Shelly Sterling's attorney said. But the judge said he is not deciding on Donald Sterling's mental capacity. Rather, the judge is going to rule only on issues of the trust and whether its procedures were followed correctly.

"(CNN) -- The world's appetite for fish is now at an all time high according to the United Nations.  Figures from the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) state fish is currently the most-traded food commodity, worth around $102 billion in 2008. But as our appetite for fish increases, the world's fish stocks are becoming increasingly overexploited and depleted, which ""gives cause for concern"" the U.N.'s 2010 State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture report has stated. Put simply, we are eating too much, says Dr Daniel Pauly, marine biologist and professor at the University of British Colombia. ""The pressure we are imposing on the world's fisheries is excessive. Either we are eating too much or we are too many,"" he said. But he added: ""Fishery science is very much divided in this debate."" ""Three or four years ago there was wide consensus that fisheries were doing very badly, now again it has become a contentious issue, much like talk on global warming,"" he continued. Much of the debate is focused around annual figures of global fish catches, which reached a peak of 86.3 million tons per year in 1996. Since then there has been a decline, with 2008's annual fish catch dropping to around 79.5 million tons. While some scientists suggest the downward trend shows a move away from over-fishing and a replenishing of fish stocks, others believe the data proves fish stocks are already overexploited or depleted. Pauly believes the change in fish catches and a spike in fish consumption can be explained, in part, by the expansion of fishing operations into new waters over the last 50 years. ""Europe like the U.S. and Japan now get most of their fish from the developing world,"" he said. ""As the European stock was depleted, Europe simply went south and expanded. We find the same sort of expansion in Japan and the U.S., so instead of being sustainable, we have just moved on. The logical end of this, and we have begun, is fishing krill in Antarctica. "" he continued. But he said: ""This southward expansion seems to be at an end, because there are no more waters to be conquered. While scientists disagree on the current state of fisheries worldwide, the FAO has made its conclusions clear, stating global fishing catches will not be able to increase ""unless effective management plans are put in place to rebuild over-fished stocks."" As Pauly states: ""The need to rebuild instead of expand is not rocket science. If we do not rebuild our fisheries, how will we ever produce a decent yield?""","A United Nations report has stated global consumption of fish is at an all time high .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea says it may back out of the family reunions it agreed to hold with South Korea if the latter continues with the annual drills it holds with the United States. Annual military exercises in the region by South Korean and U.S. forces are scheduled for the end of this month. ""The reckless act of war is a violent violation and infringement of humanitarianism,"" a spokesman for the North Korean Policy Department of the National Defense Commission said Thursday. ""It does not make sense to carry out the reunion of families, who were separated due to the War, during a dangerous nuclear war practice."" The drills, the South Korean defense ministry said Thursday, will go on. The reunions of about 100 people from each country are scheduled to take place between February 20 and 25, the South Korean unification ministry said Wednesday, following face-to-face talks between the two sides. If they go ahead, the meetings of divided Korean families would be the first to take place since 2010. North Korea has unceremoniously pulled the plug on such meetings in the past. ""If such agreements get turned around repeatedly, it cannot move forward,"" South Korean Unification Minister Rhoo Kihl-jae told reporters. ""We've seen these in the past several decades. To expand the trust, I want to say that the agreement must be kept."" Drills infuriate N.Korea . The drills infuriate North Korea, which says it sees them as a prelude to an invasion. Last year, it ratcheted up its threatening rhetoric to alarming levels as the exercises took place. In its calls so far this year for better relations, North Korea has asked South Korea not to take part in the drills -- a request that Seoul and Washington have rejected. Past disappointment . Reunions were due to take place last September, but Pyongyang canceled them with only a few days notice, accusing Seoul of souring ties between the two countries. The reunions are an emotive issue. And time is running out for many of the surviving members of the families that were split by the 1950-53 war between the two Koreas. A lot of them are now in their 80s and 90s. Tens of thousands of people in South Korea are on the list of those wanting to take part in the reunions. This month's planned reunions are scheduled to take place at the site where previous ones were held: Mount Kumgang, a resort on the North Korean side of the border that used to be jointly operated by both sides.

"(CNN) -- A Muslim activist group has launched a new ad campaign to reclaim a word they say has been abused and distorted by Muslim extremists and by anti-Muslim groups. The MyJihad ad campaign is using print ads and social media to educate the public about what they say is the true meaning of the word ""jihad."" The Merriam Webster dictionary defines the term as ""1: a holy war waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty; also: a personal struggle in devotion to Islam especially involving spiritual discipline"" and ""2: a crusade for a principle or belief."" But some religious activists dispute the emphasis on ""holy war."" They say the word is often misunderstood and has been co-opted and ""misapplied"" by radical Muslims who use it to justify terrorist acts and by anti-Muslim groups who use the word to foment fear in non-Muslims. ""The word 'jihad' literally means struggle, struggle for a good cause,"" said Nihad Awad, national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. ""It is a concept, a noble concept, within Islam that emphasizes a personal struggle within yourself to be a better person, a better husband, better wife, better worker, better neighbor,"" he explained. ""It is not aggression, and it does not mean to commit harm against other people. If people commit harm against innocent people, it will be in violation of the spirit of Islam and a violation of the concept of jihad."" Lawyers seek to limit New York police surveillance of Muslims . The campaign is the brainchild of Ahmed Rehab, an activist who is also the executive director of CAIR in Chicago. He launched the effort in December with a small group of activists. They began running ads on 25 city buses in Chicago and later expanded to buses in San Francisco. The ads began running at four metro stations in Washington in late January. They depict Muslims and non-Muslims sharing how they define their personal struggles. One shows a white Jewish man and a black Muslim man standing side by side, with the slogan ""#MyJihad is to build bridges across the aisle."" Another shows a young female photographer wearing a headscarf and holding a camera. The slogan reads ""#MyJihad is to capture the truth even when it's unpopular."" Rehab said the donor-funded campaign is about making sure Muslim children can grow up in a world where they're judged on their own merits and not according to radical stereotypes. Controversial 'Defeat Jihad' ad in NYC subways? ""I don't wake up in the morning looking for my Kalashnikov or AK-47,"" he said, highlighting one such stereotype. The group has also taken its campaign to social media, asking supporters to post on their Facebook pages and use #MyJihad on Twitter to share their personal struggles. Rehab said they have received tens of thousands of encouraging tweets, Facebook messages, letters and e-mails. The campaign has also attracted skeptics, especially online. A user with the Twitter handle @Shaqton wrote: ""Al-Qaeda: #MyJihad is carrying 'earth-shattering, shocking and terrifying' attacks against 'heart of the land of non-belief' -- U.S. and Europe."" Another user, with the handle @PeterTownsend7,wrote: ""Claiming that critics read the Quran 'out of context' is another way of saying that you wish it did not say what it plainly does #myjihad."" Awad said the organizers of the campaign should expect to face resistance to their message but believes they will be successful in starting a conversation about this important tenet of Islam. Faith groups launch campaign to counter controversial 'Defeat Jihad' ad . ""It's an uphill battle, because you are trying to dismantle preconceived ideas about the concept of jihad, because traditionally people have seen stereotypes and they have seen actions by some Muslims, and the majority of Muslims did not step in to say, 'No, this is our faith, and we are going to claim it,'"" he said. ""It is going to be an uphill battle, because you are trying to undo accumulation of misperception and mispractice -- misperception by non-Muslims and mispractice by some Muslims, and I think it's important for us to take this initiative."" The group hopes to place ads in more cities in the United States and around the world and to expand to other media such as radio and television. ""The message is global. The goal is anti-radicalization,"" Rehab said.","Muslim group wants to reclaim true meaning of the word ""jihad""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel approved Wednesday the construction of a settlement in East Jerusalem just before U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is to visit the country on a peace mission. Kerry will meet with Israeli, Palestinian Authority and Jordanian officials in Jordan and Jerusalem from Thursday to Saturday in the wake of President Barack Obama's efforts in Israel last March urging renewed peace talks. Palestinian chief peace negotiator Saeb Erekat called out to the world Thursday to stop Israel from building more settlement homes. Letting Tel Aviv get away with it, takes away any motivation for Israel to work towards peace, he said. In January, the United Nations Human Rights Council said Israeli settlements amount to ""creeping annexation"" of Palestinian territories by Israel and have taken a ""heavy toll"" on the rights and sovereignty of Palestinians. The construction of new homes is ""taking Palestinian land, lives and livelihoods,"" Erekat lamented. Wednesday's approval of a 69-unit settlement in East Jerusalem -- which Palestinians consider to be the capital of their future state one day -- harkens to an incident in 2010 when Israel announced another East Jerusalem settlement during a visit by Vice President Joe Biden. Then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the announcement ""insulting"" to the United States. On Wednesday, Meir Margalit, a Jerusalem City Council member from the left-wing Meretz party, criticized Wednesday's settlement approval and described it as ""provocation"" by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government. The approval by an Israeli planning committee was part of a ""very long process"" and now means that construction can start at any time, Margalit said. ""This is a provocation by Netanyahu's government when John Kerry is coming to re-start the negotiations,"" Margalit said. ""To approve these houses in Har Homa, or also known as Jabal Abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem, is a foolish move. This means that Israel has no serious intentions to restart the peace process,"" Margalit said. Israel's construction of settlements ""is more important than peace in the Middle East,"" Margalit charged. But a senior Israeli government official who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue said there was no political influence behind the approval process. ""This is private land, private constructions and nothing to do with the government or with government agendas,"" the official said. Brachie Sprung, an advisor to the Jerusalem mayor, said construction permission was granted by local planning and building committee. ""It should be noted that the municipality has no legal right to stop the property ownership of the citizens to whom the ground belongs,"" Sprung said in a statement. ""There is no change in the policy of the municipality over the last four years, and we are continuing to build in all the suburbs of the city according to the development program for Jews and Arabs as one,"" Sprung said. Thousands of housing units are expected to be built throughout Jerusalem in coming years, Sprung said. ""New building in Jerusalem is necessary for the development of the city and gives the opportunity for youngsters and students to live and buy,"" Sprung added. Hagit Ofran, settlement watch director for the Israeli activist group Peace Now, said the construction plan was initially filed in April 2012, and the length of time behind its approval is typical. CNN's Kareem Khadder reported from Jerusalem and Michael Martinez wrote and reported from Los Angeles. Mike Schwartz also contributed from Jerusalem.","NEW: Palestinian chief negotiator calls international community to stop settlements .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama met Saturday with family members of ailing South African statesman Nelson Mandela and spoke by telephone with Mandela's wife as she maintains a vigil by his bedside. However, he and first lady Michelle Obama will not visit the anti-apartheid icon at the hospital ""out of deference to Nelson Mandela's peace and comfort, and the family's wishes,"" the White House said. ""I expressed my hope that Madiba draws peace and comfort from the time that he is spending with loved ones, and also expressed my heartfelt support for the entire family as they work through this difficult time,"" Obama said after meeting with Mandela family members in Johannesburg. Madiba is Mandela's clan name. Those present for the meeting at the Nelson Mandela Foundation included Mandela's two daughters, Makaziwe and Zindzi, and eight of his grandchildren. ""I have drawn strength from the support received from President Barack Obama, Michelle, Malia and Sasha,"" said Mandela's wife, Graca Machel, of her phone conversation with the U.S. president. Machel said she had already conveyed the Obama family's ""messages of strength and inspiration"" to her husband. 5 things Obama wants young South Africans to know . Obama is undertaking his first full day of activities Saturday in South Africa, a nation where hearts are heavy over the poor health of the revered statesman. He held a town hall-style meeting with young people in Soweto, a Johannesburg neighborhood at the heart of the anti-apartheid struggle, where he spoke of the vital role Africa's youth would play in the continent's future. Obama earlier held bilateral talks with South African President Jacob Zuma in Pretoria, with trade high on the agenda. In a news conference after the talks, both paid tribute to Mandela's contributions as an anti-apartheid campaigner and former president. ""I know that he is your personal hero as well,"" Zuma said. ""The two of you are also bound by history as the first black presidents of your respective countries. Thus, you both carry the dreams of millions of people in Africa and in the diaspora who were previously oppressed."" Trade, other ties . Obama said the thoughts of Americans and people worldwide are with Mandela, his family and South Africans. ""The struggle here against apartheid, for freedom; Madiba's moral courage; this country's historic transition to a free and democratic nation has been a personal inspiration to me. It has been an inspiration to the world,"" he said. ""The outpouring ... of love that we've seen in recent days shows that the triumph of Nelson Mandela and this nation speaks to something very deep in the human spirit: the yearning for justice and dignity that transcends boundaries of race and class and faith and country,"" Obama added. ""That's what Nelson Mandela represents. That's what South Africa, at its best, can represent to the world, and that's what brings me back here."" The two presidents also addressed the importance of growing trade and business relationships between their nations, and between the United States and the continent. ""I'm here because I think the United States needs to engage with a continent full of promise and possibility,"" Obama said. ""It's good for the United States. I welcome the attention that Africa is receiving from China, Brazil, India and Turkey ... I'm not threatened by it."" Obama's trip aims to bolster U.S. investment opportunities, address development issues such as food security and health, and promote democracy. It comes as China aggressively engages the continent, pouring billions of dollars into it and replacing the United States as Africa's largest trading partner. Africa's greater integration into the global economy will benefit everyone, Obama said, with the potential creation of new jobs and opportunities. But he said his advice to Africa is to make sure those who come to invest in the continent and its natural resources also bring benefit to Africans, in terms of jobs and ""value added,"" not just themselves and a few top leaders. HIV/AIDS gains . Obama also praised South Africa for its leadership in tackling HIV/AIDS, saying that within a few years it will be the first country in Africa fully to maintain its own HIV care and treatment program. This move will allow the United States to focus its assistance on other countries, he said. Zuma brought up South Africa's bid for a seat on the U.N. Security Council. Obama acknowledged a need to update the Security Council but said doing so was complicated. He also pointed out that many nations want a seat at the table but not all live up to their responsibilities to act or make difficult decisions. Obama's visit to Africa's biggest economy is part of a three-nation trip that started in Senegal and will end in Tanzania next week. Asked about his father's native Kenya, where some are disappointed at Obama's decision not to visit, the U.S. president said the timing was not right but that the United States would continue to work with ""one of our oldest partners in Africa."" Obama said he had decided to visit other African nations in part because he had been to Kenya ""multiple times."" He said it didn't seem the ""optimal time"" to go because Kenya had just had a presidential election, which he was pleased to see happen peacefully. The new administration also has to manage issues around the International Criminal Court, he said. The ICC has indicted Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, accusing him of funding a local militia that conducted reprisal attacks in the last election in 2007. His deputy, William Ruto, also faces charges of crimes against humanity at the ICC. Both deny wrongdoing. ""If in 3Â½ years, if I'm not there, you can fault me on my promise,"" Obama added to his questioners, who were connected to the Soweto meeting via a remote hookup from Nairobi, Kenya. Mandela critical but stable . Zuma said Mandela remained in critical condition following his hospitalization three weeks ago, but he is stable. The South African president voiced hope the 94-year-old's condition would improve and that he'd be able to leave the hospital, where he has been since June 8 with a recurring lung infection. Former South African President F. W. de Klerk and his wife, Elita, have suspended their visit in Europe due to Nelson Mandela's medical condition, the F. W. de Klerk Foundation said Saturday. The de Klerks will arrive back in Cape Town on Sunday, and ""their thoughts are with the Mandela family during this difficult time and they join in their prayers for an improvement in Mr. Mandela's health,"" the foundation said. A meeting between the U.S. president and Mandela would have had historic significance. Like Obama, Mandela broke through racial barriers to become the first black president of South Africa. The two have met before when Obama was a U.S. senator. As Mandela's condition has deteriorated, South Africans have gathered outside the hospital, praying, lighting candles and leaving notes for the man they refer to as ""tata,"" the Xhosa word for father. Mandela became an international figure while enduring 27 years in prison for fighting apartheid, South Africa's system of racial segregation. He was elected the nation's first black president in 1994, four years after he was freed. Mandela remains popular worldwide as an icon of peaceful reconciliation. ""If and when he passes from this place, one thing I think we'll all know is that his legacy is one that will linger on throughout the ages,"" Obama said. In addition to a series of events planned for the weekend, Obama will also visit Robben Island, where Mandela spent a majority of his decades in prison.

"Paris, France (CNN) -- A French court on Wednesday sentenced Manuel Noriega to seven years in prison for money laundering -- but.the former Panamanian dictator could be eligible for parole as early as next year, his lawyer told CNN. Noriega, who has been a prisoner since being toppled in a U.S. invasion more than 20 years ago, was also fined 2.2 million euros ($2.7 million), the amount he was accused of laundering in drug trafficking profits through French banks. The former dictator, who was was extradited from the U.S. to France in April, looked shaken and disconsolate at the sentence. Noriega spoke briefly to his three daughters after the sentencing, then had to be helped out of the court by French police, CNN's Jim Bittermann reported from the scene. Noriega's lawyer, Yves Leberquier, said during the trial he was ""flabbergasted"" at prosecutors' call for his client to spend 10 years in jail, saying that a long sentence would mean death in jail for Noriega. If he serves the full seven-year sentence he will be 83 when he is released. But another lawyer, Antonin Levy, said Noriega would get credit for the 32 months he served in a U.S. prison during a court fight over his extradition to France to face the charges. He can apply for parole halfway into his seven-year sentence, Levy said. During the trial, Leberquier tried to paint Noriega as the victim of larger geopolitical forces, accusing the U.S. of placing and moving pawns to serve its interests. He urged the court to see beyond the image of Noriega as a dictator and a drug trafficker, which he said was given to him by the United States. The rise and fall of Noriega, Central America's strongman . Noriega told the court that he had a once-strong relationship with the United States. ""I received high praise from the U.S., Interpol and other countries who all benefited from my fight against drugs,"" Noriega said. Testifying in Spanish -- and standing for a total of five hours with only two five-minute breaks -- he added, ""I was especially in contact with the CIA,"" describing himself as a ""mediator."" The CIA has not commented on Noriega's claims. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cleared the way for Noriega to be sent to France in April after he spent more than 20 years in a U.S. federal prison. Noriega and his attorneys had argued that the United States was violating the Geneva Convention by not sending him back to Panama, where he was seized by U.S. troops after the United States invaded that country in 1989. U.S. federal courts ruled against him. U.S. forces removed the ex-dictator from office during Operation Nifty Package, the 1989 invasion of Panama. Noriega had fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City. U.S. troops set up large speakers around the compound, blaring music at all hours, a psychological ploy to rattle the general. He eventually surrendered on January 3, 1990, and was quickly escorted to the United States for civilian trial. After his drug conviction, Noriega was given prisoner of war status. His federal sentence, originally for 30 years, ended in September 2007 after time off for good behavior. In Panama, Noriega is wanted for the murder of a political rival. Panama has requested his extradition, but the United States honored France's extradition request instead. Panama has convicted him in absentia but has said he would get a new trial if he returns to his home country. CNN's Jim Bitterman and Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","French court sentences Manuel Noriega to seven years in prison .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama congratulated Michael Sam on Saturday for being the first openly gay football player taken in the National Football League draft, the White House said in a statement. ""From the playing field to the corporate boardroom, LGBT Americans prove everyday that you should be judged by what you do and not who you are,"" Obama said. He also congratulated the NFL and the St. Louis Rams, the team that drafted Sam. Sam, an All-American defensive end who played for the University of Missouri, made history when he was picked by the Rams in the seventh and final round. He was the 249th of 256 players selected. The 24-year-old got the news by telephone from Rams' coach Jeff Fisher, who told Sam: ""You are a Ram. The wait is finally over."" Sam, who was filmed by ESPN as he got the call, broke down in tears and kissed his boyfriend. ""Thank you,"" he could be heard saying to Fisher. Later, Sam took to Twitter to post a picture of himself, smiling. ""Thank you to the St. Louis Rams and the whole city of St. Louis,"" he said in the post. ""I'm using every (ounce) of this to achieve greatness!!"" See Sam's reaction . St. Louis is only a two-hour drive from Columbia, home of the University of Missouri, where Sam starred. Besides being a first-team All-American, the 6-foot-2, 260-pounder was named the co-defensive player of the year in the Southeastern Conference, widely considered college football's best league. His fellow Tigers named him the team's most valuable player. With those credentials, Sam was expected to be selected, but as the three-day draft wore on, there were questions whether he would. Fisher told ESPN that Sam was a player who was rated by the team as going much higher in the draft. ""We weren't going to miss the opportunity to add an outstanding player to our roster,"" he said. In February, Sam came out in interviews with ESPN and The New York Times, a decision that raised questions about whether he had damaged his chances to play in the NFL. ""I came to tell the world I'm an openly proud gay man,"" he said in an interview with ESPN. Sam said he told his Missouri teammates in August and suffered no repercussions. He said he was surprised to discover many people in the media already knew he was gay. ""I understand how big this is,"" Sam said in the ESPN interview. ""It's a big deal. No one has done this before. And it's kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL."" Sam also spoke about his sexual orientation to The New York Times, saying: ""I just want to make sure I could tell my story the way I want to tell it. I just want to own my truth."" At the start of the draft on Thursday, it appeared it was also on Sam's mind. ""No matter what happen(s) these next few days, I will always cherish moments like this!!!,"" he said in a post on Twitter. Sam's draft was viewed as a barometer of whether the NFL was ready to accept an openly gay player. His selection is viewed as a bright spot for a league that has faced a host of criticism in recent months, from questions about the lack of minorities promoted to the number of players arrested for bad behavior. ""I think this is a good day, against the backdrop of what has happened in the NBA recently,"" Margaret Hoover, a political commentator and gay rights activist, told CNN. The NFL Players Association also weighed in on Sam's good news. ""We wish him the best of luck as we do all of the 2014 NFL Draft class,"" said George Atallah, the association's assistant executive director of external affairs. Other athletes have come out as gay, but they didn't have Sam's profile. Among them are the NBA's Jason Collins, the WNBA's Brittney Griner, WWE's Darren Young, UFC's Liz Carmouche, MMA's Fallon Fox and Major League Soccer's Robbie Rogers. Of those athletes, Collins made the biggest media splash. ""I think it's great. I'm looking forward to seeing him play,"" Collins, who plays for the Brooklyn Nets, told ESPN after the draft pick was announced. The road to football stardom was not an easy one for Sam, who graduated from Missouri in December. One of eight children, he grew up in Hitchcock, Texas, where he was raised primarily by his mother. At one point, he has said, he lived out of his mother's car and briefly stayed with another family. Three of Sam's siblings have died, including an older brother he saw die from a gunshot wound. Two of his brothers are serving prison sentences. Complete coverage: Rams pick Michael Sam . NFL draft winners and losers .

"(CNN) -- Forget the distracting cameo by David Petraeus. Despite its disjointed narrative, ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II"" twisted me around so many times with its compelling story that I really enjoyed myself. Treyarch Studios set this new chapter of the popular first-person-shooter franchise in two time periods: the late 1980s and 2025. They consulted with military experts who helped guide what the future technology of war should and shouldn't look like. The game's single-player campaign staggers like a drunken New Year's reveler between the past and the future. Missions hop from one time to another with little or no continuity between the actions. One mission will have you battling in Panama during the late '80s, and then the next takes you to a luxury resort in the Cayman Islands in the near future, with different characters and different weapons. The reason for this back-and-forth is nestled in the father/son storyline of the Mason family. Dad Alex is a Black Ops vet who is called back into active duty in 1986 to help the CIA with some missions in Africa and Latin America. In the future, son David is a Navy SEAL, leading a Joint Special Operations Command team. Linking the two is a terrorist known as Raul Menendez. He harbors great anger toward the West and capitalism in general. Players discover Menendez's motivations through the past missions, which reveal how he plans his final revenge in the future. The backdrop for all this is the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, and a new Cold War between the U.S. and China. The new tensions are spurred not by ideology but by a soon-to-be depleted resource known as rare earth minerals -- those materials used in nearly all our computer technology. Combat . Combat is pretty typical for a first-person shooter game. Plenty of weapon choices and some destructible environments make for fast-paced, frenetic battle scenes. Some of the weapon effects are suspect though as shots to the head do not always kill their targets. The enemies aren't the brightest bulbs in the box and are predictable in their actions. There were times I cleared the area of bad guys, just to have another wave rush in before I could move forward. And then another one after that. Also, my adversaries didn't show much imagination when attacking, choosing the same pathways each time and the same prairie-dog tendency to pop up from behind cover so I could pick them off. There is little challenge to the larger combat scenes. More fun is the vehicle portion of combat. Using the nimble quad-copter drones in the sky and the mechanized CLAW (Cognitive Land Assault Weapon) on the ground brought new energy to the battles. During the Strike Force missions (these are side missions to the central campaign, but critical to the final outcome), players can take over control of these devices, which offers a refreshing new perspective on the battlefield while dealing damage to the enemy. The Strike Force missions themselves are new to the franchise. They're not directly part of the storyline, but how you perform in them will help shape the game's ending sequence. Players are tasked to attack or defend different points on a battlefield, and can either do it at ground level, by taking over one of the combat units, or by directing all the troops from an overhead view. Failure is an option here, and if you don't succeed with your squad allotments, you don't get to try again. Story . I found the storyline interesting. While most of the action occurs through the eyes of the Mason family, there were some instances when I got to see what was happening from another character's perspective. This helped explain much of the reasoning behind characters' actions. A Petraeus shows up briefly near the end of the game as the secretary of defense in 2025, congratulating the team on a job well done. (Game publisher Activision, in a recent statement, said, ""Including Gen. Petraeus and other real-life figures was strictly a creative decision made many months ago when the storyline was drafted."") Other real-life people in the game include former Panamanian President Manuel Noriega and Lt. Col. Oliver North, the central figure from the 1987 Iran-Contra scandal. North did his own voice for the game and even acted an adviser. Historical footage from the 1980s and '90s features former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. The game's ending is simultaneously emotional and confusing. But your experience may vary. Key missions produce variable endings, depending on what you do and who survives. They all add up to a variety of endings for the main characters and add to the replay value if you are the kind of gamer who wants to see all the potential conclusions. Multiplayer modes . If killing the undead is more your speed, ""Black Ops II"" brought back the zombies from the previous game in a side-campaign fight for survival. This turned out to be more fun than I expected because of the bonus add-ons you can collect and the power-ups that turn your weapon into a more potent killing machine. The zombie voice acting is extremely funny. I don't know if I'd enjoy a full game of just zombies, but it does make a nice change of pace from all the realism of the regular combat. If you like multiplayer action, ""Black Ops II"" gives you plenty of modes. You can choose your class, weapons and maps from many different combinations. Most matches contain up to 12 players, while some go as high as 18. The action is clean and the intensity is high. At one point during my multiplayer session, there were more than 650,000 players online. You can also record your gameplay to view later and see what you did right and wrong. However, I should mention that some things -- such as my brutal ending to the game -- are not meant to be seen again. Overall, ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II"" doesn't break any new ground with its graphics or gameplay mechanics. But it does provide an emotionally intense single-player story, an enjoyably silly zombie mode and enough multiplayer modes for everyone to find a good game. Combined, that's enough to keep gamers glued to their controllers for many nights to come. ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II"" is available in North America; it will be released in Europe and Australia on November 30, and Japan on December 20. It can be played on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows PC. The game is rated M for mature due to blood and gore, intense violence, strong language, suggestive themes and use of drugs. This review was done with a provided Hardened Edition copy for the Xbox 360.","""Call of Duty: Black Ops II"" is an exciting ride that should keep gamers riveted .

"(CNN) -- The Internet has radically altered many things, not least the speed at which we all share and receive information, and the depth of the information available. Before the Internet, information about individuals (that they did not choose to share with you themselves) could only be found by finding others who knew the individual or by trawling through media archives. The Internet changed all that. Now, at the touch of a button, it is possible to call up a huge amount of information about individuals -- not just public figures, but ""ordinary"" people, all sorted by search engines in complicated, secretive ways over which we have no control. This, many argue, is a major flaw in the system that needs fixing. Why should Google, Yahoo or any other search engine be the arbiter of what information others see about me when they run a search? What if the information that is returned in that search is ""irrelevant"" or ""outdated"" and no longer reflects who I am -- or indeed causes people to treat me differently? These worries are understandable. But the solution proposed by the European Union Court of Justice earlier this month is not the answer. Recognizing people's concerns about their privacy, the European court ruled that individuals had the ""right to be forgotten"" -- that they should be allowed to request search engines to remove information considered ""irrelevant, outdated, or otherwise inappropriate"" and that the search engines would have to remove this material from search indices except in public interest cases. It is this gray area that is of concern to Index on Censorship. Search engines are not public bodies -- and while there is a legitimate reason to worry about the way in which these organizations present search results, the way to fix that is certainly not through a vague and woolly ruling that leaves decisions about what is and is not in the public interest in the hands of a private body. There is no legal oversight or appeals process built in to the ruling -- the court simply leaves it up to Google and others to decide (independently of one another, a further recipe for chaos and confusion) what is and is not in the public interest. Much has been made of the fact that the ruling would exclude public figures -- but that misses the point. It is not so much current public figures wanting to whitewash their personal histories that should worry us, but the potential for those who may become important public figures -- or simply be relevant to us for other reasons (because they want to sell us products or join us in business, say) -- many years hence, to have links to information about them deleted now, making it almost impossible to find in future. Index urges the court to put a stay on its ruling while it pursues a regulatory framework that will provide legal oversight, an appeals process and ensure that private corporations are not the arbiters of public information. While it is clearly understandable that individuals should want to be able to control their online presence, the court's ruling fails to offer sufficient checks and balances to ensure that a desire to alter search requests so that they reflect a more ""accurate"" profile does not simply become a mechanism for censorship and whitewashing of history.

"(CNN) -- Only the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles stood between life and death for Troy Anthony Davis, and the core principles of American jurisprudence should have been the board's guide. But the board ignored those principles in denying Davis clemency. Davis was convicted in 1991 of the 1989 murder of Savannah police officer Mark MacPhail. But the trial included no physical evidence to support his conviction. The prosecution produced no murder weapon, no DNA evidence and no surveillance tapes. He was sentenced to death on the basis of nine so-called eyewitnesses, who testified in the trial. Seven of those witnesses, however, have since recanted or materially changed their stories. The jury, for instance, relied on two people who did not witness the crime but who testified that Davis had confessed to the shooting. Since then, both have said they were lying. The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles declared in 2007 that it ""will not allow an execution to proceed in this state unless and until its members are convinced that there is no doubt as to the guilt of the accused."" And in the Davis case, a significant measure of doubt remained. The U.S. Supreme Court took the extraordinary step of ordering a lower court to conduct an evidentiary hearing in the case because of the witness recantations and the absence of hard evidence. But in that hearing, the federal judge established a much higher standard of proof than the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles. After finding -- astonishingly for the first time -- that executing an innocent man is unconstitutional, the court then required Davis to prove that he was innocent. Proving innocence is far more difficult than establishing doubts as to one's guilt and flips our system of criminal jurisprudence on its head. Instead of the American system's presumption of innocence and a requirement that the state prove guilt, Davis' evidentiary hearing began with the court presuming guilt and required the condemned to prove his innocence. Even though the judge in the evidentiary hearing denied Davis a new trial, he conceded the standard was ""extraordinarily high."" Davis was unable to meet this nearly insurmountable task. But while he fell short of ""proving"" his innocence, he established doubts as to his guilt, prompting the judge to concede the state's case against him was ""not ironclad."" I support the death penalty, and have for a long time. And I am not making a judgment as to whether Davis is guilty or innocent. But surely the citizens of Savannah and the state of Georgia want justice served on behalf of MacPhail, the police officer. Imposing a death sentence on the skimpiest of evidence does not serve the interest of justice. The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles did not honor the standards of justice on which all Americans depend by granting clemency. In doing so, it will allow a man to be executed when we cannot be assured of his guilt. That was the final admirable principle standing between Davis and his scheduled death by lethal injection Wednesday. And the parole board did not uphold it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Barr.","Bob Barr: Georgia parole board's denial of clemency to Troy Davis was wrong ruling .

"(CNN) -- Pele has backed Brazil to deliver a ""fantastic"" World Cup amid growing fears the country will not be ready in time to host football's showpiece event. The legendary former striker, who won three World Cups with Brazil between 1958 and 1970, has rejected accusations that delays to a number of the 12 venues hamper his country's ability to put on a spectacle. FIFA , the game's world governing body, has confirmed it expects all six stadiums still under construction to miss the deadline of December 31. ""I've no doubt,"" Pele told CNN when asked if he thought the World Cup would be a success. ""We had a little problem with the Confederations Cup (in June) but I've no doubt the World Cup will be a fantastic show."" Two people were killed last month at Arena Corinthians when a crane hoisting a part of the metal roof collapsed, causing the piece to fall, partially damaging the building, according to a statement released by the construction company, Odebrecht Infrastructure. After meetings ahead of Friday's World Cup draw, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said it had received confirmation that Arena Corinthians would not be completed until the middle of April. ""It is a question of trust,"" he said at a press conference at the Costa Do Sauipe resort where the draw will be held. ""For the time being there is no Plan B."" Despite the setback, Pele is adamant that Brazil will be ready for the tournament, which is scheduled to start in Sao Paulo on June 12. ""I think Brazil has the stadiums,"" he said. ""We have eight months to go before the World Cup. We have to forget about the stadiums and pay attention to the game."" FIFA also confirmed that stadiums in Cuiaba, Manaus, Natal and Porto Alegre have yet to confirm their schedules, but are expected to host their first events in January 2014. Curitiba, meanwhile, is scheduled to host its first match in late February or early March. Brazil has not hosted the World Cup since 1950 -- when it lost 2-1 in the deciding match to Uruguay. It is a result which still rankles with Pele. ""Listen, if I was God, I would like to see Brazil play against Uruguay,"" he added. ""It's a good opportunity to get revenge. ""To talk about the possibility today ... of course we have two national teams that play very good. ""I think Germany is at a very good level. Spain has a chance to get to the final and Brazil. ""At the moment those are the three national teams, but you cannot forget Argentina, Italy, England -- all the teams that have tradition to be in the final. ""But I hope Brazil get to the final."" Pele sat down with CNN in Sao Paulo where he was shooting a Subway commercial with swimming champion Michael Phelps. He is set to take part in Friday's World Cup draw where all 32 teams will discover their fate. But the 73-year-old says he is desperate to avoid pulling balls out of the pots in case he hands Brazil an impossible task to get through the group stage. ""I don't know exactly what my role will be but normally when I've been at other World Cup draws in other countries. my role was to take the ball, do interviews and talk with people. ""But here in Brazil, I will not try to take the ball because I'm afraid I won't put Brazil in a good group.""","Brazilian football legend Pele says 2014 World Cup will be ""fantastic""

"(CNN) -- When I was a federal prosecutor, I had some sleepless nights. On a few occasions, it was after I had lost at trial; I would lie in bed and think of what I did wrong. Other times, though, my sleepless hours came after I had won a trial or gotten what I wanted at sentencing. The haunting question was always the same: What if I was wrong? Some might consider that admission a sign of weakness or a lack of resolve, but in retrospect, I see those nights as ones in which I was fully human. The cost of being wrong as a prosecutor is almost unthinkable. This is especially true in a capital case, such as the recent and tumultuous end game in the Troy Davis case in Georgia. Davis' final appeals to the state of Georgia were denied, despite the fact that seven of the nine witnesses against him had recanted their stories. His last hope, the U.S. Supreme Court, denied his application for a stay of execution on Wednesday night, sealing his fate. He was executed shortly after 11 p.m. The meaningful cases in law almost always involve a clash of virtues. School prayer cases, for instance, sometimes balance two virtues reflected in the Constitution itself: The guarantee of free exercise of religion, and a bar on the establishment of a state religion. In the Troy Davis case, what virtues were in conflict? On the side of execution without further delay, the virtue upheld is that of ""finality of judgment."" That is, once a verdict and judgment are rendered, it should be difficult to upset. Victims' family members sometimes see a promise in that judgment, and finality renders a certainty to the process that some see as promoting deterrence of crime. Congress, in passing bills such as 1996's Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (which strictly limited the ability of someone like Troy Davis to receive relief by petitioning for a writ of habeas corpus), sought to promote this value. The Supreme Court has also repeatedly cited ""finality of judgment"" as an important value in cutting off appeals. Other than the mention of capital punishment itself, it is hard to see much support in the Constitution for the virtue of finality. On the other hand, those seeking to delay the execution of Davis for reconsideration of the evidence promoted other virtues: deliberation and mercy. Unlike ""finality of judgment,"" these virtues are firmly rooted in the Constitution itself and the core values of Americans. Deliberation is a predominant central virtue promoted by the Constitution. That document requires that in criminal cases, there be an initial appearance, indictment by a grand jury, representation by counsel and the right to not only appeal a conviction but to petition for habeas corpus. All of these slow down the process. Above all, our Constitution expressly mandates ""Due Process,"" even when that process produces delay and uncertainty, as it is bound to do. Deliberation is what makes us civilized, and when it fails, we fail profoundly. A second virtue, mercy, is also an explicit part of the Constitution. The federalists insisted on the inclusion of the pardon power, for example, for the express reason that it gives the system some outlet for this core virtue. (In Davis' case, it is the Georgia Board of Pardons and Parole that had the power to grant clemency). The first signer of that Constitution was George Washington, who then lived out the virtues of that Constitution as president. He was literally the commander-in-chief; when the Whiskey Rebellion arose in western Pennsylvania, he personally led the army to quell the rebels, astride a white horse. Just as importantly, living out the constitutional virtue of mercy, he pardoned those rebels who were sentenced to hang for treason. The Troy Davis case shows us a truth: We have wandered too far from our own best virtues. If we are to err, let it be on the side of deliberation and mercy, rather than the unsettling finality we have seen pursued by the state of Georgia. Should we choose those better virtues, we might all sleep better. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Osler.","Mark Osler: Courts considering Troy Davis case had to balance values .
He says the argument to proceed was the virtue of ""finality of judgment""

"(CNN) -- This weekend marks the kickoff of what millions of Americans have been looking forward to since the final minutes of Seattle's Super Bowl victory in early February -- another football season. Players, primed and ready, will take to the field, inspired to make their mark on the new season. Loyal fans, football-starved from a long offseason, will tune in to cheer on their hometown teams. No one can avoid the nervous energy that defines the start of a new season. But one thing fans should never have to worry about is whether or not this week's game will be impossible to watch due to a TV blackout. It is unfortunate that we will kick off yet another football season with federal rules on the books that serve only to protect the leagues at the expense of sports fans. One of these rules is the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) sports blackout rule, which prohibits a cable or satellite company from carrying a game that is blacked-out within the local broadcast area. While this affects leagues beyond the NFL, it occurs most often when, under the NFL's rules, a home game does not sell out at least 72 hours before kickoff. Under the FCC's sports blackout rule, cable and satellite companies are unable to televise that game in the local broadcast market, leaving local fans in the dark. While the blackout rule was originally cast as a way to encourage ticket sales, this rationale is no longer supported by the facts. The FCC is aware of this and voted unanimously last December to propose elimination of the rule, acknowledging that the record does not support the argument that blackouts increase ticket sales and that ""the sports blackout rules have become obsolete."" The comment period for this change concluded long ago, and the well-developed record clearly supports erasing the blackout rule from the books. But we are still waiting on the commission to cast a final vote. We wrote FCC Commissioner Tom Wheeler in June, urging him to bring the rule to a final vote before the start of the new NFL season and he indicated the FCC will do so by ""early fall."" That time has now come, another season is upon us, and there is no reason to further delay. This is not a partisan issue, as a clear majority of FCC members from both political parties supports striking the rule. In an increasingly divided government, it would be a breath of fresh air for Republican and Democratic FCC Commissioners to unite with football fans and vote to spike this outdated regulation. It is not surprising that since the vote last December, the NFL has launched an expensive lobbying and public relations campaign aimed at ensuring the blackout rule stays on the books. Their efforts have obscured the facts, arguing erroneously that the sports blackout rule has worked since its inception nearly 40 years ago. Unfortunately for the league, facts are stubborn things. Research by sports economists indicates there is no link between the blackout rule and stadium attendance. The league has even threatened to move games from free broadcast TV to pay services like cable if the FCC carries through with the vote. This last-minute pitch is all for the purpose of protecting the NFL's bottom line and preserving the status quo, which netted the league over $9 billion in revenues last year. Further, the NFL enjoys nonprofit status -- meaning it pays no income tax -- and many games are played in stadiums financed in large part with taxpayer dollars. Federal regulations shouldn't favor multi-billion dollar sports leagues over consumers, especially when those leagues have benefited so greatly from those very same taxpayers and sports fans. As the new season begins, we hope the FCC will do the right thing, and immediately vote to eliminate this outdated anti-consumer rule. At a time when Washington doesn't seem capable of achieving much, making sure fans aren't left in the dark this season could count as a real accomplishment, one deserving a cheer from the American people.","McCain, Blumenthal: NFL game blackouts are unfair to fans .

"London (CNN) -- Police in England said Friday they have seized what could be the parts for Britain's first firearm made using 3-D printing -- but later said more testing is needed to establish if this is the case. An initial news release from Greater Manchester Police said officers had found ""a 3D printer and what is suspected to be a 3D plastic magazine and trigger which could be fitted together to make a viable 3D gun"" when they searched locations Thursday in the Baguley area, near Manchester in northwest England. But after doubts were raised, the force released a second statement stressing that the parts were still being examined. ""We need to be absolutely clear that at this stage, we cannot categorically say we have recovered the component parts for a 3D gun,"" Assistant Chief Constable Steve Heywood said. ""What we have seized are items that need further forensic testing by national ballistics experts to establish whether they can be used in the construction of a genuine, viable firearm. ""We will also be conducting a thorough analysis of computers we have recovered to establish any evidence of a blueprint on how to construct such a weapon."" U.S.-based tech blog Gigaom reported that it appeared the items police suspected of being gun components were in fact spare parts for the 3D printer. The raid that netted the items was part of a planned week of action against criminal gangs in Manchester, police said. A man has been arrested on suspicion of making gunpowder and is being questioned. 3-D printed guns a boon for criminals? In his statement, Heywood said the seizure had prompted discussion around the potential threats posed by 3-D printing. ""Clearly the fact we have seized a 3D printer and have intelligence about the possible production of a weapon using this technology is of concern. It (is) prudent we establish exactly what these parts can be used for and whether they pose any threat,"" he said. ""What this has also done is open up a wider debate about the emerging threat these next generation of weapons might pose."" Printing instructions . Others have also raised concerns about the potential for 3-D printing to be used to create weapons. U.S. requires group to remove 3-D gun instructions from its website . This year, the U.S. State Department ordered Defense Distributed, a nonprofit group set up by a Texas law student, to remove instructions for printing a handgun with a 3-D printer from its website. Video shows test-firing of 3-D printed handgun . The group's founder, Cody Wilson, had posted a video online showing a single shot being fired from ""The Liberator,"" a plastic handgun that, with the exception of a metal firing pin and a piece of metal included to comply with the Undetectable Firearms Act, was assembled entirely from parts made with a 3-D printer. Wilson complied with the order, but not before the design had been downloaded more than 100,000 times. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London subsequently acquired two models of the Liberator pistol, which were put on display last month as part of a design exhibition. The Science Museum in London also has a Liberator on display.

"(CNN) -- How does a survivor of sexual abuse respond to students rioting at Penn State? ""You're not getting it. You just don't get it,"" said Dave Lorenz who was abused by a priest as a teen. ""It's just stupid youthfulness."" Earlier this week, legendary head football coach Joe Paterno was removed in the midst of a scandal involving sexual abuse allegations against a former defensive coordinator, Jerry Sandusky. What started as an apparent celebration of Paterno turned into a riot in the Pennsylvania town of State College. The crowd tipped over a news van and decried the media in anger Wednesday night. They held signs in support of ""JoePa"" -- a nickname for Paterno. Some said their frustration stemmed from the media's focus on Paterno, rather than the charges against Sandusky. Watching footage of Penn State students rioting in the streets Wednesday night, Lorenzo shuddered, then hung his head. What bothered Lorenz is that students ""rallied around (Paterno's) house, cheering him up."" ""The kids up there just don't understand what this does,"" he said. ""Stop thinking of the adult and start thinking of what happens to a child that goes through this. You love the adult, you may not know the kid. Start thinking of the kid and the horror they go through, because it's hell."" Paterno has been under scrutiny because of his response to allegations brought to him in 2002 by a graduate assistant. The assistant allegedly said he witnessed Sandusky, now 67, having sex with a young boy in a shower at the campus football complex, according to a grand jury indictment. Paterno reported the allegations to his boss and Pennsylvania's attorney general said it appeared Paterno had met his obligations under state law. But critics said the coach should have reported the suspected abuse to police. Sandusky is accused of sexual offenses, child endangerment and ""corruption of a minor"" involving eight boys. Many within the Penn State community condemned the crowd's actions. In the campus newspaper The Daily Collegian, an editorial read: ""Wednesday night was an embarrassment for Penn State... The way students reacted set our university two steps back."" Penn State grapples with conflict over coach's firing, horrific allegations . Earlier this week, as questions about the coach's action mounted, students began swarming Paterno's home. The gatherings had the tone of a pep rally. Kayla Garriott, a 22-year-old college student who was sexually abused as a child, said the open support for Paterno was disrespectful to survivors. ""That's the first thing people look at -- that their football team is without their head coach that's been there so many years. Nobody looks at the eight children."" The rioters are ""never going to be in those children's shoes. It's not about football. It's about eight children who are never going to get back their lives back. They're going to live with this the rest of their lives. They might not get over that."" This kind of spectacle could even make abused kids more reluctant to go to the police, she said. The Penn State scandal prompted numerous calls from sexual abuse survivors, said Barbara Dorris, the outreach director at Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. ""I have talked to people all over the country who have dealt with their abuse,"" she said. ""This is bringing it all back. It's so upsetting. They were crying. They were angry."" The reaction of the crowd could send an unintended message to children and teenagers who've been abused: They may feel blamed for what happened to the football team and the rioting, said Dorris, who was also abused as a child. It's a ""horrible statement that a winning football team is more important than the safety of the children. It mirrors what happened in the (Catholic) church."" SI.com: Penn State tragedy shows danger of making coaches false idols . Jerry Needel, a Penn State alum who graduated in 1999, watched the news unfold and felt he had to do something. ""This just shook my beliefs and a big part of my identity to the core,"" he said. He started a campaign to shift the attention to supporting victims of child abuse, by raising money for RAINN, which stands for Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network. In addition, some Penn State students are planning to dress in blue for their next football game to support the victims of child abuse worldwide. Jennifer Marsh, the director of the National Sexual Assault Hotline said the news story is bringing awareness and facilitating a national discussion about abuse, a topic often cloaked in secrecy. ""The biggest takeaway we've seen is just the outpouring of support to victims and survivors.""

"(CNN) -- Despite food safety measures, the threat of foodborne illness remains in meat and produce -- and some types of illness are on the rise, recent reports say. About 48 million people contract some form of food poisoning each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Salmonella remained the top cause of foodborne illness last year, according to the CDC's 2012 report card on food poisoning, issued Thursday. However, the overall instance of Salmonella was unchanged from the 2006-08 data, the agency said. The report card is based on reports from 10 U.S. regions, representing about 15% of the country. The second most common cause of illness was Campylobacter, which increased 14% over the 2006-08 data, the CDC said. Campylobacter lives on live chickens and can taint meat during slaughter; it can also be found in raw, unpasteurized milk. Chicken and ground beef top a list of ""risky meat"" published Tuesday by the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Researchers from this advocacy group examined data from foodborne illness outbreaks over a 12-year period and found between 1998 and 2010, meat and poultry products were linked to ""at least 1,714 outbreaks involving 33,372 illnesses."" That estimate may only be the tip of the iceberg, the group said, as people may not seek medical attention for food poisoning and cases go unrecorded. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has an online reporting tool for those who think they might have a foodborne illness. ""We applaud CSPI's ongoing efforts to educate consumers about food safety,"" Dr. Elisabeth Hagen, the USDA's undersecretary for food safety, said in a statement responding to the report. ""While we have made progress in making food safer -- including cutting E. coli O157-related illnesses in half -- we still have work to do. As Salmonella rates continue to stagnate, we look forward to CSPI's support, and the support of other groups committed to food safety, of our efforts to reduce this dangerous foodborne pathogen, including modernization of the poultry inspection system."" In addition, the Environmental Working Group last week published an analysis of existing data on antibiotic-resistant bacteria contained in meat sold in supermarkets. Eighty-one percent of ground chicken, 69% of pork chops, 55% of ground beef and 39% of chicken were found to contain the bacteria, the organization reported, citing data from a February Food and Drug Administration report. Antibiotic resistance reduces doctors' options to treat you if you become ill. What government tests found in your meat . On Monday, the Environmental Working Group published the latest version of its ""dirty dozen"" fruits and vegetables. The advocacy group describes it as a consumer shoppers' guide to determine which types of produce pose the highest threat of pesticides. Although pesticides are not a cause of foodborne illness, produce can be a source of food poisoning. In 2012, cantaloupes, spinach and spring mix salad and mangoes were linked to outbreaks. Improving food safety begins before the products ever reach the consumer, at the slaughterhouse and in the fields, but ""being careful in the kitchen is also very important,"" said Dr. Robert Tauxe, deputy director of the CDC's Division of Foodborne, Waterborne and Environmental Diseases. So what's a consumer to do? At the store . A CDC study published in 2010 once again highlighted the fact that young children can be exposed to raw meat and poultry products while riding in shopping carts, particularly if they ride in the basket of the cart. Researchers suggest that parents keep their child away from these products, which could be leaking juices carrying bacteria, by placing their child in the cart's seat, and not place meat or poultry products in the seat while shopping to avoid contamination. All consumers can benefit from separating their raw meat, poultry and seafood purchases from other food products to prevent cross-contamination. The USDA recommends placing these types of foods in plastic bags and also placing these purchases in separate shopping bags at checkout. Storage . Packaging meat products in leak-proof containers would also help cut cross-contamination. New Zealand, for instance, saw a significant reduction in foodborne illness after mandating leak-proof packaging, Tauxe said. When you get home, storing raw meats in a plastic bag or container to prevent any juices from dripping on other foods is also important. Listeria monocytogenes, another type of illness-causing bacteria, can grow in foods in the refrigerator, according to the CDC. Use an appliance thermometer to check the temperature inside the fridge; it should be 40 degrees or lower, and the freezer should be 0 degrees or lower. Food preparation . Start with clean hands. Wash with soap and water for 20 seconds (sing ""Happy Birthday"" twice) before and after handling food -- and after other activities, such as changing diapers or using the bathroom. Ideally, use separate cutting boards for fruits and vegetables and raw meat to avoid cross-contamination. Wash fruits and vegetables under running water. Scrubbing melons and cucumbers with a clean brush is recommended; using soap to clean them is not. Some home cooks wash their meat under running water before cooking, but, experts say, that can spread contaminated juices in places that may not be visible. Use hot, soapy water to clean utensils and cutting boards after preparing foods; use hot, soapy water and paper towels or clean towels to clean work surfaces. Proper cooking is essential for meat, poultry and seafood. Cooking temperatures have to reach a certain temperature to destroy bacteria such as E. Coli and Salmonella; a meat thermometer is the only way to be sure those temperatures have been reached. A thermometer should be placed in the thickest part of the meat without touching the bone. Ground beef, lamb and poultry should be cooked to 160 degrees Fahrenheit; whole chickens, turkeys and poultry parts to 165 degrees; and whole cuts of meat-like steaks, chops and roasts to 145 degrees, followed by three minutes of rest time before carving or eating. Storing leftovers . Harmful bacteria can start growing at room temperature, so any leftovers should go into the fridge or freezer within two hours of cooking. Storage times for the fridge and freezer can vary depending on the food.","Meat, fruit and vegetables can all pose a risk of foodborne illness .

"(CNN) -- ""Dancing with the Stars"" got off to a fresh start Monday with actor Alfonso Ribeiro taking the lead in the season 19 premiere. The episode was the debut of the new cast, which includes ""Fresh Prince"" star Ribeiro, comedian Tommy Chong, athlete Lolo Jones, ""Duck Dynasty"" star Sadie Robertson and more. Performing a jive with pro partner Witney Carson, Ribeiro got a standing ovation for his moves. Judge Julianne Hough, herself a former ""Dancing with the Stars"" pro, said she was ""blown away,"" and her fellow judges Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli and Carrie Ann Inaba seemed to agree. All told, Ribeiro walked away from Monday's show with a score of 36 out of a possible 40, the best of the night. Right behind him was ""Duck Dynasty's"" Robertson, who nailed her cha-cha with pro partner Mark Ballas. Performed to Katy Perry's ""Birthday,"" Robertson's routine earned a score of 34. On the greener side of things was Tommy Chong, who rolled onto the set with his comedy partner, Cheech Marin. The 76-year-old bluntly told Time magazine recently that he's hoping to give his career another boost with ""DWTS,"" along with his dream of becoming ""the poster boy for the marijuana community."" ""Medical marijuana is my passion in life. I went for jail for my beliefs. Now that we're getting legal, I want to focus on the benefits of medical marijuana -- it helps little children with epilepsy and MS, and it helped me with my cancer,"" Chong said. And while ""Dancing with the Stars"" won't allow him to ""show pot leaves or bongs,"" Chong continued, ""they have Tommy Chong, who really is a pot leaf."" So when he made his entrance during Monday's show, it was no accident that Chong and his partner, Peta Murgatroyd, were wearing so much green. (""Peta, my partner,"" Chong told Time, ""is going to look like a little marijuana bud."") The verdant pair did a cha-cha to Snoop Dogg's ""Drop It Like It's Hot,"" much to the delight of the judges, who awarded them 27 points. On the lower side of the scoreboard were designer Betsey Johnson and Olympian Lolo Jones. Johnson's cha-cha suffered from a bit of a wardrobe malfunction, and she and partner Tony Dovolani earned the lowest score of the night with a total of 20. Jones and her pro partner, Keo Motsepe, didn't fare much better. Even she admitted that her routine, a cha-cha, was pretty ""awful,"" and the judges didn't disagree. Jones and Motsepe were given a score of 22, the second-lowest of the evening. The ""Dancing with the Stars"" audience also gets a chance to weigh in on its favorite pair.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The life and apparent death of the ex-Los Angeles Police Department cop who declared war against police corruption has generated a social media fringe of fans asserting that Christopher Jordan Dorner was really a hero seeking justice, despite being a suspect in four killings. The sympathizers have garnered 18,336 supporters on a Facebook page entitled ""We Stand With Christopher Dorner."" The online group has posted Dorner's manifesto against corrupt police, a document that was ""scrubbed by mainstream media outlets,"" the webpage charges. Another Facebook page, ""We Are All Chris Dorner,"" had 3,819 ""likes,"" or followers, with 6,620 people talking about the page devoted to how the 6-foot, 270-pound Dorner was ""the victim of a manhunt and smear campaign. 5 years ago he was fired from the LAPD for seeking to expose corruption within it."" ""He killed CORRUPT cops, cops kill INNOCENT people!"" one supporter wrote on one of the Facebook pages. Sheriff: 'This investigation is over' ""it's a shame we the people couldn't help dorner against these government forces,"" another wrote. Other supporters used Twitter: ""Apparently burning people alive is now considered appropriate behavior for the police. Judge, jury and executioner,"" tweeted one man whose handle is @becomeyoung. That comment referred to how Dorner, 33, a fired Los Angeles police officer and former Navy reservist, was believed to have been killed Tuesday in a vacant mountain cabin outside Los Angeles. The cabin caught fire during a shootout and standoff with police, who also fired tear gas. Dorner was a suspect in the killing of four people -- including two law enforcement officers and the daughter of another -- during the past 10 days, authorities said. Readers on CNN.com offered their own comments, advancing a theory that police made sure Dorner was dead to silence him. ""Like Dorner said he cross the blue line and they burn him down for it,"" said one reader identified as silla1. ""Poor guy, driven over the edge and then killed in the cover-up. guess you need assault rifles at home with the LAPD around,"" wrote a person named Phrenchy. ""Well, it couldn't have turned out better for the LAPD, they definitely didn't want Dorner in court. Heads would have rolled if Dorner would have been taken in alive somewhere,"" said a posting by WeDontMatter. Public fascination with and endorsement of an anti-hero is common in history and the arts, especially when the figure advances a political message that resonates with people, experts said. ""He's been a real-life superhero to many people,"" said Marc Lamont Hill, an associate professor of English education at Columbia University. ""Don't get me wrong. What he did was awful. Killing innocent people is bad. ""But when you read his manifesto, when you read the message he left, he wasn't entirely crazy. He had a plan and mission here, and many people aren't rooting for him to kill innocent people, they're rooting for somebody who was wronged to get a kind of revenge against the system."" Hill added. ""It is almost like watching 'Django Unchained' in real life."" Fueling Dorner's folk-hero status is social media's iconoclastic tone, said BuzzFeed Radio host Jack Moore. ""You'll have people on social media who support these villains,"" Moore said. It's also home to fans of James Holmes, the man charged with killing 12 people and wounding 58 more in a Colorado cinema in July, he added. ""There is some part of it that is social media weirdness,"" Moore continued. The narrative of Chris Dorner ""resembles a Denzel Washington movie where someone is wronged, and he stands up for himself and goes down in a blaze of glory,"" he said. Opinion: Don't focus on Chris Dorner's politics . Films are steeped in lore of the little guy raging against injustice, sometimes based on historical figures such as Bonnie and Clyde, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and Frank and Jesse James, said Elayne Rapping, a retired professor of American and media studies at the State University of New York in Buffalo. Fictional or historical, the characters are often portrayed as latter-day Robin Hoods, victims of oppression or the everyman brutalized by an economy or authority, Rapping said. ""Americans have always been fascinated with outlaws, going back to early movies, James Cagney and things like that,"" Rapping said. ""You always root for the underdog because of a sense of rebellion. ""We sympathize with them because very often, people do feel they are tied down to rules and regulations and don't have autonomy, and people say, 'I'm going to disregard this, and I'm going to do what I want to do,' "" Rapping added. Twitter users began marking their comments with ""#TeamDorner"" in support of the ex-officer. There were about 4,000 original posts with that hashtag by Wednesday afternoon. Meanwhile, more than 1,870 people joined the Twitter page @WeRChrisDorner, a fan page linked to a similarly named Facebook page. Some tweets pointed out how innocent civilians were mistakenly fired upon by police on Thursday during their weeklong manhunt in Southern California. Los Angeles Police mistakenly shot and wounded two people in nearby Torrance as the civilians drove a blue pickup resembling Dorner's vehicle. The LAPD officers involved in the shooting were placed on paid administrative leave. Torrance police also fired upon another blue pickup the same day, but no one was injured in that incident, a law enforcement source said. ""From the perspective of people watching, two cars filled with innocent people were shot at in what to a lot of people looked like street justice than police procedure,"" said Karen North, a social media expert and psychologist at the University of Southern California. Manhunt: A car chase, a gunfight and a fiery cabin . ""It certainly doesn't help a police department that has a history of what looks like brutality, and then they act in a way that looks rash and unthinking on TV,"" North added. On a talk radio station in the African-American community in Los Angeles, some residents ""were lionizing and admiring Dorner,"" said civil rights attorney Connie Rice. Rice has sued the LAPD for racism on behalf of more than 100 minority officers, an experience that she described as ""hand-to-hand combat."" The LAPD had a ""racially hostile culture,"" evidenced in the videotaped police beating of Rodney King in 1991 that later triggered street riots, Rice said. ""The LAPD's relationship with the black community could only be described as a state of war. Outside of Mississippi, I've never seen anything like it,"" Rice said. Because of reforms, however, the department has improved, and she even has a parking space at the police department's offices, she said. She pointed out how Police Chief Charlie Beck has agreed to reopen the investigation that led to Dorner's firing in 2008. In his manifesto, Dorner said he was relieved of his duties after he reported excessive force by a fellow officer in July 2007. He joined the force in 2005. The LAPD's history of racism aside, Dorner's alleged violence cannot be tolerated, Rice said. She also took strong exception with Dorner's supporters and fans in the black community and on the Internet, which she also called the ""Id town where a lot of the ugly things come out."" ""The community that comes from Martin Luther King Jr. can never condone this kind of violence,"" Rice said.","Christopher Dorner is a ""superhero"" to some, like ""Django Unchained,"" expert says .

"London (CNN) -- A Buckingham Palace guard has been pulled off of royal wedding duty this week because of offensive posts on his Facebook page, the British Ministry of Defence told CNN Monday. Cameron Reilly, the guard, used an offensive term to describe Pakistanis on his Facebook page, which was taken offline on Monday. CNN saw the comment before the page was removed. ""In view of the nature of the allegation, it would not be appropriate for the individual to be on parade for The Royal Wedding,"" the Ministry of Defence said in a statement. Reilly, who was pictured on his page wearing the traditional tall black bearskin hat of Buckingham Palace guards, did not immediately respond to CNN attempts to contact him via Facebook. Prince William of Wales, the second in line to the British throne, is marrying his college girlfriend Kate Middleton at Westminster Abbey in London on Friday. British media reported that Reilly called Middleton a ""stupid stuck up cow"" and used an obscenity to describe her on Facebook. The Ministry of Defence declined to confirm that. He listed ""causing trouble"" and ""casually breaking the law"" among his interests on Facebook. He said on the page that he joined the Scots Guards in 2010, and he posted several pictures of himself in military uniform. It's in a comment on one of those photos -- showing himself holding a rifle in each hand -- that he tells a friend he couldn't fit in any more guns because he had ""2 many paki's scalps in it already."" ""Paki"" is considered a deeply offensive term by many people of Pakistani descent. Prince William's own brother Prince Harry had to apologize two years ago for using the term to describe a fellow soldier in a video he made. A spokesman for Prince Harry apologized in a statement released by St. James's Palace. The spokesman said the prince -- who is third in line to the British throne -- ""understands how offensive this term can be, and is extremely sorry for any offense his words might cause."" He called another soldier ""our little Paki friend, Ahmed,"" in the video, which was filmed in 2006 and posted in 2009 by the News of the World tabloid. ""There is no question that Prince Harry was in any way seeking to insult his friend,"" the St. James's Palace statement said.

"(CNN) -- The arrest of drug kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman is a monumental moment in the world's war on drugs. That he was hiding in plain sight -- in a beach resort hotel in the Mexican Riviera town of Mazatlan -- is as dramatic a twist in the manhunt for Guzman as is the narrative behind his life and his control of the international Sinaloa drug cartel. Guzman captured after years on the run . Here are three reasons why the arrest of Guzman -- now being held by Mexican authorities and sought for extradition by U.S. authorities -- matters so much. 1. His legend . Chicago declared him and his use of the city as a drug-dealing hub as Public Enemy No. 1, joining bygone gangster Al Capone in that distinction. West Point's Combating Terrorism Center devoted a report to the international presence of Guzman and his drug trafficking. Perhaps most importantly, El Chapo is synonymous with narco culture and its lurid glorification. Guzman, 56, is the drug kingpin extraordinaire. El Chapo, which means ""Shorty"" in Spanish, inspires American rap songs and a genre of Mexican ballads called narcocorridos. ""All I wanna be is El Chapo, Three billion dollars in pesos"" is part of the chorus to a 2012 rap by Gucci Mane. Maybe the most potent message of El Chapo's arrest is how it undermines his most audacious myth -- that he could never be caught again, unfindable in Mexico's back country. Guzman had been caught once before by Mexican authorities, in 2001, but he escaped from a high-security Mexican prison. Lore holds that he slipped out of the prison by hiding in a laundry basket. ""He kind of plays up to it. All these guys do,"" Scott Stewart, vice president at Stratfor, a global intelligence firm, said about the El Chapo legends. ""It just kind of adds to the whole mythology -- kind of like the old pulp Western books they used to write about these outlaws."" Guzman had eluded authorities since the 2001 prison break because he cultivated an old-school mafia style of bribing officials at every level of government throughout Latin America, officials said. 2. One of the world's most wanted . Guzman's drug operation is believed to have penetrated not just all of the Americas, but Europe, Australia and west Africa as well, according to the West Point report. ""The United States remains the most important demand market for Sinaloa Federation productsâ€”marijuana, cocaine, and methamphetamines. The European Union and Australia, however, have proven attractive due to the economics of price elasticity and their distance from the supply source,"" according to the report. But authorities have been mounting pressure on Guzman's Sinaloa cartel in recent months. His lieutenants have been killed or captured by Mexican authorities. Earlier police operations yielded a trove of intelligence, including cell phone and other data, a U.S. law enforcement official said. That helped Mexican authorities and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents hunting Guzman gain confidence in recent weeks that they could arrest him. ""Although it's a ridiculous phrase, the world's most wanted drug lord is accurate,"" said Malcom Beith, author of ""The Last Narco,"" which is about Mexico's drug war. ""There's tons of other drug lords around, but I think the Sinaloa cartel, given its growth, given its influence hemispheric and otherwise, I think that puts him on the top."" Phil Jordan, who spent three decades with the DEA and headed the agency's El Paso Intelligence Center, also characterized Guzman in superlatives. ""When you arrest the most powerful man in the Americas and in Mexico, if you talk to any cartel member, they'll say that he's more powerful than Mexican President Pena Nieto,"" Jordan said. ""This would be a significant blow to the overall operations not only in the Americas, but Chapo Guzman had expanded to Europe. He was all over the place."" Even Forbes magazine put Guzman among its World's Most Powerful People since 2009. Forbes estimated his fortune at more than $1 billion. 3. U.S. indictments . Guzman's arrest has re-energized Mexican and U.S. lawmen who spent years tracking his cartel and yet unable to capture him -- until now. The United States doesn't want to see Guzman escape again. That's why they are eager to see him extradited to the United States as soon as possible, where he is named in multiple federal drug indictments and has been on the DEA's most-wanted list. ""It is a significant arrest, provided he gets extradited immediately to the United States,"" Jordan told CNN. ""If he does not get extradited, then he will be allowed to escape within a period of time."" Added one U.S. official: ""Now comes the hard part."" That official was referring to Guzman's extradition to the United States. The legend of 'El Chapo'","Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman ran Mexico's notorious Sinaloa drug cartel .
His arrest pierces legendary status as elusive, above the law .

"(CNN) -- Jury selection began Tuesday in the trial of reputed Boston mob boss and longtime fugitive James ""Whitey"" Bulger on murder and racketeering charges. Bulger was arrested in California in 2011 after 16 years on the run. Now 83, he's charged in the killings of 19 people during his days as the leader of south Boston's Winter Hill gang. Federal prosecutors say Bulger led the Irish mob from the late 1970s through the mid-1990s. But after Bulger fled impending racketeering charges, investigators found he had been an FBI informant whose handler tipped him off about the charges -- a tale that became the inspiration for the Oscar-winning 2006 drama ""The Departed."" Judge removed from Whitey Bulger trial . His lawyers tried to get the case against him tossed out, arguing that Bulger had been given immunity by the FBI. A federal judge denied that request in March, finding Bulger had no immunity for crimes committed after he cut a deal with the feds. Bulger's onetime FBI handler is serving a 50-year sentence for second-degree murder and racketeering. Bulger's brother William -- a former state Senate leader -- was forced to step down as president of the University of Massachusetts after then-Gov. Mitt Romney accused him of being evasive during congressional testimony about the whereabouts of his brother. Whitey Bulger's longtime girlfriend, Catherine Greig, went on the run with him and was arrested with him in Santa Monica. She pleaded guilty to conspiracy to harbor a fugitive and two counts of identity theft, in 2012. Landmark U.S. manhunts .

"(CNN) -- It's the kind of thing that seems to happen every day to innocent grandmas, teens and toddlers when they pass through the airport: Savannah Barry, a 16-year-old Type 1 diabetic, uses an insulin pump that can malfunction when exposed to technology used in airport screenings. When she passed through the Salt Lake City airport for a flight home to Denver in May, she asked for a pat-down, but Transportation Security Administration workers directed her to pass through a scanner. Her parents weren't there -- she was on a school trip -- but she trusted TSA agents to guide her. But the pump makers could no longer guarantee that Savannah was receiving the correct amount of insulin after it passed through the scanner, and it had to be replaced. Savannah's story became another milestone in travelers' collective loathing, annoyance and exasperation with the 50,000-person agency charged with protecting the nation's transportation systems. Travel industry watchers say the mood toward the TSA isn't at its worst right now, but it's at risk of getting there. Ten years since the agency's creation -- and nearly 11 since the last major act of terrorism aboard a U.S. plane -- travelers still detest the TSA. While the TSA doesn't count grumbles as fliers remove their shoes or leave behind oversized shampoo bottles, the number of complaints received by phone or e-mail has decreased, according to TSA data. The numbers this year are lower than in recent years past: 1,294 complaints total in March, the most recent month for which data are available. That's down from a peak of 4,027 in May 2004, the highest number since the TSA began to track and release complaint data eight years ago. Perhaps the most maligned parts of TSA security often get the lowest number of complaints. Screening procedures drew 1,960 complaints since January 2010, and security checkpoint processing time got 2,484 complaints since then. Travelers' stuff, it turns out, is the source of most complaints. Since the start of 2010, the highest number of complaints -- 18,196 -- related to damage claims for checked bags, problems for which airlines and the TSA share liability. (It's also the area that experienced the biggest decreases in recent complaint tallies.) In second place, at 10,187, were complaints about treatment of personal property at security checkpoints. The mood toward the TSA isn't good, but it was worse in late 2010, when the TSA began to deploy full-body scanners and pat-downs in airports, said National Geographic Traveler's ombudsman and consumer advocate, Christopher Elliott. Back then, some declared ""We won't fly"" or rallied behind the idea of National Opt-Out Day, which called for passengers to request pat-downs instead of going through the scanners on the busiest travel day of the year. (In the end, Opt-Out Day didn't disturb lines.) That November, a USA Today/Gallup poll found that 57% of adult fliers were bothered or angered by security pat-downs, while 42% felt that way about full-body scans. The outrage spawned a social media-fed genre of viral videos and stories about poorly handled TSA scans -- like Savannah Barry's -- and grope-y pat-downs. Fliers weren't happy then, Elliott said, and he thinks the tension is bubbling again. ""People trust them until something happens, until they get a screener that makes them take their pants off or frisks them in a way they think is too invasive,"" he said. The TSA is ""under pressure from Congress to do more with less. There are questions about the safety of the body scanners. There have been numerous misunderstandings between passengers and the (screeners). All those things add up."" Air rage: Passengers 'quicker to snap' Unofficial complaints about the TSA go way beyond frustration over wrapped holiday gifts and suspicious baked goods. Critics say it's ineffective, inconsistent and unconstitutional; that it's not actually making travelers safer and creates a false sense of security; that its officers are poorly trained, its equipment unsafe and its methods embarrassing. In May, an inspector general's report said the TSA wasn't adequately tracking or fixing airport security breaches. New this week, some complain it costs fliers too much. After 10 years with a security fee of $2.50 for passengers, the TSA wants to offset rising costs by boosting it to $5 for each leg of a trip. TSA officials said they're trying to help their relationship with travelers by clearing up security do's and don'ts in a mobile app and allowing some direct contact through ""Blogger Bob"" Burns. The agency wants to shorten waits and reduce invasive security checks by expanding PreCheck, a program that puts passengers who share more personal information on a fast-track through security screenings; it will be in 35 of the country's largest airports by the end of the year. For now, users are mostly frequent fliers invited to join, but the TSA said PreCheck will open up to military personnel, kids and people ages 75 and older. Airline squeeze: It's not you, 'it's the seat' But does the TSA need to win any government agency popularity contests? Does it make a difference if its customers don't like it or if they trust it at all? A difficult relationship with travelers might mean the TSA misses out on useful observations that could be shared by roughly 50 million passengers who pass through airport checkpoints every month. New York law enforcement has successfully relied on people's observations and ingrained the idea in the public through the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's now-familiar slogan, ""If you see something, say something."" The Department of Homeland Security launched its own ad campaign with the slogan last year, although it wasn't aimed specifically at customers who come into contact with the TSA. ""The TSA had never really gotten the kind of traction we needed with our customers,"" former TSA Administrator Kip Hawley wrote in his book, ""Permanent Emergency: Inside the TSA and the Fight for the Future of American Security,"" published in April. ""Gaining the willful participation and support of the public would give us access to the largest and most dynamic network out there."" Security technologist Bruce Schneier said he's not aware of data that link security to the relationship between the agency and its customers -- but it's a good question. ""I believe the TSA is having a credibility problem,"" he said. ""If you hate something, you're going to have a worse time doing it. If people don't trust something and hate it, then it goes less well."" A study published in Security Journal last year found that passengers in the United Kingdom had a higher opinion of whole-body scanners after they were presented with unbiased information about them, including risks and sample images. They found them fast and less intrusive than pat-downs. Not informing passengers about scanners can open the door to misinformation and critics, the study's authors said, and hurt the long-term acceptance and legitimacy of airport security. What will make customers happy, though, depends on their complaints. Schneier said he'd be happier if the TSA ran airport security that looked more like it did before September 11, 2001, before liquid bans, body scanners and shoe removal. He calls the TSA's best-known processes ""security theater"" but said there's no political will to eliminate it. ""Everyone complains about the TSA, but nobody really wants to be on the hook for getting it wrong,"" he said. The golden days of air travel: How glorious were they? Elliott, the consumer advocate and author of ""Scammed: How to Save Your Money and Find Better Service in a World of Schemes, Swindles and Shady Deals,"" said he'd feel better about the TSA if it eliminated its Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response, or VIPR, teams at train stations and NFL games and instead stuck to airport security. When he's in line to fly, he wants better explanations about TSA procedures and to know that more money is steered toward intelligence instead of ""unconstitutional"" scans and pat-downs. ""It's a matter of using billions of dollars in a smarter way,"" he said. ""There's always going to be people that say, 'If you take a step back, you're going to create the next 9/11.' Those are paranoid voices, and they're always going to be there. I have to listen to the rational voices that say we've gone too far."" The Barry family in Denver wants TSA agents trained so everyone with a medical device or condition can make it through security checkpoints safely, said Sandra Barry, whose daughter's insulin pump was replaced after its ill-fated trip through Salt Lake City's airport. Barry said they respect that TSA officers are highly trained and low-paid and ""have an important job to do."" She can even understand why security officers wanted to send Savannah through the scanner: It was busy, scanners are quick, and the public usually isn't thrilled about security agents patting down teenage girls. But the Barry family isn't flying again until they're confident their kids -- both of whom have Type 1 diabetes -- will have pumps that work beyond the checkpoint. Insulin pumps can cost $8,000 to $10,000, Barry said, and it can be hard for pump users to switch back to injections. The family will be driving to their summer vacation destinations this year. The agency said last month that it would respond directly to the Barry family and that it regularly works with disability and medical condition advocacy groups to adapt screening procedures. Indeed, Barry said, they spoke with TSA officials on a conference call this week and are reviewing a proposal they hope will make flying easier for diabetics. So far, Barry said, the TSA has been slow but responsive. ""We could be their best advocate. This could be a total turnaround and nice PR for them,"" Barry said. ""Right now, our relationship is really amicable, and we'd like to keep it that way.""","Complaints to the Transportation Security Administration have dropped .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A series of car and roadside bombs targeting buses and bus stations rocked predominately Shiite areas of Iraq on Thursday, killing at least 19 people and wounding more than 100, police said. Two separate incidents happened at bus stations in Karbala province, south of Baghdad. In the first bombing, a car exploded at a bus depot near the Awan Shiite shrine, killing a bystander and wounding 17. Later Thursday, a pair of bombs erupted in a busy bus station in northern Karbala, killing at least five and wounding 15 others. Read more: Dozens killed in attacks in Iraq . In Salaheddin province, north of Baghdad, a car bomb and three roadside bombs exploded near buses carrying Shiite pilgrims in al-Dujail. The blasts killed at least eight and wounded 81. And in Babil province, south of the Iraqi capital, another bus station bombing killed five and wounded 10. Overall, violence has dropped significantly in the country since the peak of sectarian violence between 2005 and 2007, but flare-ups have become commonplace again recently. Read more: Suicide bomber kills Iraqi lawmaker, police say . Last month, at least 208 Iraqi soldiers, police officers, and -- mostly -- civilians were killed in attacks, according to figures compiled by Iraq's Interior, Defense and Health ministries. The uptick in violence has coincided with three weeks of demonstrations in Sunni provinces, including Anbar and Mosul, with protesters demanding that the Shiite-led government stop what they call second-class treatment of Iraq's Sunni community. Sunnis largely boycotted Iraq's 2005 elections, leading to the emergence of a Shiite-led government. The move left the once-ruling minority disaffected, which contributed to years of bloody insurgency and sectarian warfare. These protests were triggered last month when Iraqi security forces arrested bodyguards of Finance Minister Rafie al-Essawi, a Sunni. Al-Essawi on Monday escaped a roadside bomb attack on his convoy near Baghdad. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq reported from Iraq and Mark Morgenstein contributed from Atlanta.","At least 19 people killed and more than 100 injured in bombings in Iraq, police say .

"Boston (CNN) -- As the seven-week-long parade that was the trial of Boston mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger passed by, jurors, courtroom spectators and the public watched and listened as former bookies, former drug dealers, extortion victims, gangsters, convicted killers, families of murder victims, and former FBI agents made their appearances. Everyone in that parade had one thing in common: their lives were forever altered by the 83-year-old man who now sat day after day after day at the defense table. In courtroom give-and-take, there was profanity, there was violence echoing in the testimony of some witnesses as they described killings in gruesome detail, there was pain etched into the court record by the words of relatives as they remembered loved ones lost to Bulger's wrath. In the end, the jury came back with a guilty verdict on 31 of 32 counts against Bulger, including involvement in 11 murders, extortion, money laundering and weapons possession. But for those who became part of the Whitey Bulger parade -- and who still walk through their days with its many impacts -- the verdict wasn't really the end. Bulger linked to 11 murders . ""I said 'rat-tat-tat-tat' as Whitey was being led out of the court room, because it was reference to the comment he had ... about killing my father,"" Cheryl Connors said after court Monday. The jury found that Bulger was involved in killing ""Eddie"" Connors, a Dorchester bartender who was lured to a phone booth in 1975 and murdered with a machine gun. Bulger was the shooter, according to witness testimony. During the trial the jury heard a recorded conversation with Bulger describing the murder of Connors and imitating the sound of a machine gun. ""Eddie Connors ... the guy in the phone booth ... pa-pa-pa-pa pow,"" Bulger said in the recorded chat with relatives. So Cheryl Connors made her own machine-gun sounds Monday. ""I yelled that as he was going out, knowing that he would know what I was talking about,"" she said. That recorded phone conversation was one of the few moments the jury heard Bulger's voice, except for a few expletives he let loose from time to time to describe witnesses or testimony not to his liking. In the early days of the trial, it was like a meeting of old friends, Bulger listening carefully -- laughing heartily at one point -- to colorful recollections of former Boston bookie Richard O'Brien, who ran a successful bookmaking operation that he inherited from his father. Bulger guilty in killings, racketeering . But this was no remember-when reunion between two elderly men. The 84-year-old O'Brien, who lives in Florida and uses a wheel chair, described a meeting between Bulger and a man who owed him money. When the man balked at paying, Bulger replied, ""We have a business besides bookmaking."" ""What's that?"" the man asked. ""Killing (expletive) like you."" Bulger, who had shown little emotion up during the trial until then, threw his head back and let out a laugh. Hitman, convicted killer, and former partner John Martorano also took the stand and implicated Bulger in 13 murders. Martorano alluded to Bulger as ""Judas,"" a term that he described as ""a person like an informant, a rat, a no-good guy. I was brought up that that was the worst thing in the world."" Although Bulger's lawyers tried to highlight inconsistencies in Martorano's testimony, he didn't waiver, declaring he hadn't lied to prosecutors since cutting a deal that guaranteed his testimony in exchange for a 14-year sentence. Martorano admitted to over 20 murders and served just 12 years on good behavior before becoming a free man in 2007. Prosecutors revealed a 700-page file that showed Bulger was on the FBI books as an informant for nearly 20 years, at the same time he was committing acts of murder, extortion, and money-laundering. In a trial that exposed deep-seated corruption in the FBI and government during Bulger's heyday, jurors heard from a disgraced FBI supervisor who admitted to tipping off Bulger's rogue informant handler that one of Bulger's associates had turned and had become an informant. Disgraced John Morris apologized in court to the family of Michael Donahue, one of the victims determined by the jury to have died when he was caught in the crossfire of an attempted hit on another man. Morris said he was sorry for leaking sensitive information that eventually made its way to the reputed South Boston crime boss and cost Donahue his life. ""I don't ask for your forgiveness, but I do want to express my sincere apology for things I may have done and things I didn't do,"" Morris said to the Donahue family. Michael Donahue's three sons and widow, Patricia, sat front row in the reserved section in the Boston courtroom. Bulger uttered under his breath ""You're a f---ing liar,"" as Morris, who admitted to accepting thousands of dollars in payoffs, testified that there was ""no question"" the Irish gangster doubled as an informant for FBI in Boston. That was not the only time expletives flew in federal court. Bulger's former mob enforcer, Kevin Weeks, described as a ""surrogate son,"" to Bulger, said in court ""We killed people that were rats, and I had the two biggest rats right next to me ..."" At that, Bulger turned and hissed, ""You suck."" ""F--- you, OK,"" snapped Weeks from the witness stand. ""F--- you, too,"" shouted Bulger from his chair at the defense table as the jury watched and listened. ""What do you want to do?"" said Weeks, his eyes locked on Bulger, who was flushed and staring right back. Weeks testified he was there the night Edward ""Brian"" Halloran was killed. He placed the murder weapon squarely in Bulger's hands. ""Bulger just kept shooting,"" said Weeks describing Halloran's writhing, bullet-ridden body as ""bouncing off the ground."" Bulger was convicted in connection with Halloran's death. Prosecutors offered up extortion victim after extortion victim to show Bulger conspired to collect ""rent"" from operating criminals in South Boston. William Lindholm barely survived a life-or-death Russian-roulette-style drama after Bulger tried to extort $1 million. According to Lindholm, Bulger ordered one of his associates to shoot past Lindholm's head with a gun equipped with a silencer -- proving the gun worked -- before ordering his associate to reload the weapon with a single bullet. ""A bullet was put in the chamber, it was spun and pointed at my head,"" said Lindholm. ""The trigger was pulled and it didn't go off."" Prosecutors wrapped up 30 days of testimony by placing 30 guns and nearly $822,000 in cash on a table -- items seized from Bulger's Santa Monica, California, apartment when he was arrested in 2011 after spending 16 years as a fugitive. Bulger's defense wrapped its case with witnesses in five days, calling former FBI agents whotestified to the corrupt nature of Boston FBI in the '70s and '80s. The defense put 20 photos on the public docket unveiling Bulger's softer side, leading people to speculate that the gangster might testify. In the end, he did not. ""My thing is...I didn't get a fair trial. This is a sham. Do what ya's want with me,"" the defendant told the judge before the case went to the jury. His voice shaking, Bulger insisted he had a deal with the late Jeremiah O'Sullivan, head of the Justice Department's New England Organized Crime Strike Force who later became U.S. attorney in Boston during the height of Bulger's alleged gangland reign. ""In return, he promised to give me immunity. As far as I'm concerned I didn't get a fair trial,"" Bulger said. CNN's Kristina Sgueglia and Deborah Feyerick reported from Boston, and Monte Plott wrote from Atlanta.","The trial was a parade of witnesses, characters, victims .
Memories were relived, murders were recalled .
In the end, the jury believed the stream of testimony, evidence against Bulger .

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- At least 10 heavily armed militants forced their way into a court building Sunday in Mogadishu, Somalia, and launched a deadly attack, according to a local journalist who witnessed the aftermath. Some of the assailants detonated explosives before others exchanged fire with government security, witnesses said. Diplomatic sources told CNN that 29 people were killed in the courthouse attack. At least nine members of the Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab were also killed, the sources said. That group claimed responsibility for the attack. Nearly 60 people were wounded in the skirmish, the officials said. ""Above all, today's operations ought to drive this unambiguous message home: there is no safe haven for apostates in Mogadishu!"" the group said on Twitter, according to a CNN translation. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said called the strike ""nothing but a sign of desperation by the terrorists,"" saying the militants ""are in complete decline."" The president said the court complex was one of several sites hit. ""We are moving forward, but the enemy of Somalia, the enemy of all mankind, will attempt to set us back and try to prevent us from prospering. I want the terrorist to know that our country, Somalia, is moving and will keep moving forward and will not be prevented to achieve the ultimate noble goal, a peaceful and stable Somalia, by a few desperate terrorists,"" he said. The regional court was in session at the time of the attack, witnesses said. The building also houses the nation's Supreme Court. Radio Mogadishu, a state radio service, reported that at least 100 people who were in the building had come out safely. Somali security officials said two Turkish nationals from a passing aid convoy and two Somali civilians were killed in a car bombing attack near the Mogadishu airport. Witnesses told CNN there also were fatal bombings at a military intelligence building and a clinic.

"(CNN) -- The small fruit has the color of a cranberry, the shape of an almond and tastes like a flavorless gummy. The ""miracle fruit"" makes acidic foods, such as lemons and grapefruits, sweet and candy-like. But after chewing the fruit and rubbing the pulp against the tongue, the berry, known by a promising name -- ""miracle fruit"" or Synsepalum dulcificum -- releases a sweetening potency that alters the taste buds. For about 15 to 30 minutes, everything sour is sweet. Lemons lose their zing and taste like candy. Oranges become sickeningly sweet.  Hot sauce that usually burns the tongue tastes like honey barbecue sauce that scorches as it trickles down the throat. Through word of mouth, these miracle fruits have inspired ""taste tripping"" parties, where foodies and curious eaters pay $10 to $35 to try the berries, which are native to West Africa. About five months ago, a Miami, Florida, hospital began studying whether the fruit's sweetening effects can restore the appetite of cancer patients whose chemotherapy treatments have left them with dulled taste buds. ""What happens in patients is the food tastes so metallic and bland, it becomes repulsive,"" said Dr. Mike Cusnir, a lead researcher on the project and oncologist at Mount Sinai Medical Center. ""Most of the patients undergoing chemotherapy have weight loss. Then they cut further into their diet and then this furthers the weight loss. It causes malnutrition, decreased function of the body and electrolyte imbalance.""   Watch a flavor tripping demonstration and the interview with Cusnir. » . One of Cusnir's patients, Don Blechman, told him about the fruit after discovering it while he and his wife volunteered at a tropical fruit garden in Coral Gables, Florida. ""We didn't need it, but we thought it's wonderful and told a lot of people,"" said his wife, Terry Blechman. ""If you can't eat because everything tastes bitter, and one berry gives you back your taste for a meal, what is it worth? It's worth everything."" Cusnir filed for an investigational new drug application, which is required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to use an unapproved product in a new patient population. His study seeks 40 cancer patients. ""The majority have given good feedback that it did improve taste,"" Cusnir said. ""A few patients felt there wasn't much change. The feedback is mixed as it usually is in any situation. It's been encouraging, but we haven't analyzed the data so far."" If the results show promise of helping cancer patients to maintain a healthy body weight and appetite, there will be bigger studies, Cusnir said. The process is expected to take several years.  ""If this doesn't work, we move on and spend resources on something else instead,"" he said. It's not only cancer patients and foodies turning to the miracle fruit. Carmen Duporte, a Fort Lauderdale,Florida, resident, integrated the miracle fruit into her routine drinks of aloe vera juice. Duporte drinks the juice to cleanse her digestive system, but hates its thick and long-lasting taste. ""It's really bitter,"" she said. ""If I don't take [the miracle fruit], I'd be having that taste for a long time. When I drink it with the fruit, there's no taste in my mouth."" Duporte told her friends about the berries, because ""it's such a friendly fruit."" Through word of mouth, the miracle fruit has picked up buzz. ""This new resurgence of interest is fascinating,"" said Linda Bartoshuk, a professor at the University of Florida's Center for Smell and Taste. ""It popped on the scene and people are having fun with it. It motivated us to go back and do research."" Bartoshuk seeks to better understand how the berry works. In the 1970s, she studied the fruit while working for the U.S. Navy and Army labs. The miracle fruit contains a natural protein, called miraculin, which has sugar molecules that bind to the tongue, she said. When acid enters the mouth, the sugar molecules press into the sweet receptors. Some of her colleagues are looking into how the berries could help people with diabetes and obesity, because they sweeten the taste of food. Unlike sugar, the miracle fruit  has very few calories and unlike artificial sweeteners, the berries are natural. Bartoshuk said she hasn't seen any reports of dangers from eating the berries, but warned against premature health benefit claims. ""Everyone's immediate response is it's an artificial sweetener, it'll help you lose weight,"" she said. ""But the bad side is artificial sweeteners don't help you lose weight. Any real claims for health benefits are going to have to be supported by good research."" After the FDA in 1974 declared that miraculin was a food additive, the miracle fruit grew in obscurity in South Florida and remained a local treat. Individual farmers, like Curtis Mozie, a retired post office employee, raised the berries and began shipping them to customers who found him on the Internet. ""I felt like everyone else needs to be aware of this fruit,"" said Mozie of Fort Lauderdale. ""Why was it kept hush-hush? I wanted people to enjoy the fruit and enjoy the experience and any edible item that doesn't taste good with the help of the miracle fruit."" Curiosity about the fruit began to circulate among exotic fruit seekers. After a few media reports, other small farms cropped up and companies started selling the miracle fruit and tablets. ""No offense meant to people who want to pay money to eat miracle fruit and weird things. We used to do that every Friday,"" said Richard Campbell, who oversees the tropical fruits at the Fairchild Tropical Fruit Garden. ""We grew up with miracle fruit. People came over, ate miracle fruit and sat around eating limes. I feel stupid I didn't think of charging anyone.""","Miracle fruit launches ""taste tripping"" parties where foodies eat lemon, hot sauce .

"(CNN) -- A low-level systems administrator? Or a highly trained spy? Edward Snowden sought to bolster his credentials during an interview with NBC ""Nightly News"" anchor Brian Williams. The one-hour interview, Snowden's first with a U.S. television network, is scheduled to air at 10 p.m. ET on Wednesday. An excerpt aired Tuesday night. ""I was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense of the word -- in that I lived and worked undercover, overseas, pretending to work in a job that I'm not -- and even being assigned a name that was not mine,"" Snowden said. ""Now, the government might deny these things. They might frame it in certain ways, and say, oh, well, you know, he's a low-level analyst. ""But what they're trying to do is they're trying to use one position that I've had in a career, here or there, to distract from the totality of my experience, which is that I've worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, undercover, overseas. ""I've worked for the National Security Agency, undercover, overseas. And I've worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency as a lecturer at the Joint Counterintelligence Training Academy, where I developed sources and methods for keeping our information and people secure in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world."" Snowden continued: ""So when they say I'm a low-level systems administrator, that I don't know what I'm talking about, I'd say it's somewhat misleading."" A spokeswoman for the NSA declined to comment Tuesday on the NBC report. Williams traveled to Moscow, where Snowden fled to escape prosecution for leaking classified documents that detailed U.S. surveillance programs. Snowden hasn't been able to leave Russia since U.S. officials charged him with espionage and revoked his passport. What he leaked sparked a national debate about privacy and security. President Barack Obama and military officials remain in support of mass, warrantless surveillance. But civil libertarians, technology companies and others oppose it, noting the lack of transparency. CNN's Jose Pagliery and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.","NSA document leaker Edward Snowden says he was trained as a spy .

"(CNN) -- Beach volleyball played on sun-kissed Brazilian sand conjures up many images in the mind. But beach tennis? What's that all about? Vinicius Font is on a mission to change that perception as he muscles in on a sport -- think elements of the court mixed with those of volleyball -- that has been traditionally dominated by Italy. ""Everybody told me I was crazy when I started practicing my ass off, because there's no money in it,"" the Brazilian, who is the the first non-Italian to top the world rankings, tells CNN's Human to Hero series. ""But I saw the Italians playing and I said, 'I can play like them. I want to.' ""I started working hard for this. I would go on the beach with coconuts and trash cans and put them as targets for the serves and do sprints. All alone. ""Then my craziness got people -- more crazy people -- around me, so I started teaching beach tennis."" A popular pastime for nearly a century, the game was not formalized as a competitive endeavor until the 1990s by Italian Giandomenico Bellettini. Unlike conventional tennis, the beach version does not allow the ball to hit the ground. As in volleyball, players serve and volley it over the raised net, diving around the sand to keep it in play with their paddle-like rackets. ""In the beginning I didn't like the game that much because it was quite slow. It was too slow. But then I tried more, and I saw the game evolving and I just fell in love with it,"" Font says. ""I found a coach, the Italian guy who brought the game to Brazil. We share an apartment and he's been helping me since I started."" In 2013 Font helped Brazil become the first team apart from Italy to win the world title, and this season he has spent a month as the sport's No. 1 player -- a year ahead of the goal he'd set himself. ""Everything happened really quickly, and I got a glance of what it feels like to be No. 1 -- and I want to be back there."" It's a far cry from when he started out in the sport. Font used to go to work in Recreio in the morning, then in the afternoon he'd skip lunch and travel 40 minutes across Rio de Janeiro to Ipanema Beach, train with his coach, before heading back home to work until 10 p.m. ""I played tennis my entire life,"" Font says. ""In 2008 a friend told me that there was this sport coming to Brazil. That I should try it because serve and volley is all I can do in tennis, so you can be good at this."" Font made his life easier by moving to Ipanema, and now has a team supporting him: two coaches, a nutritionist, a physical trainer, a Pilates trainer, a psychologist. He can now look back and laugh at his early efforts in the sport, starting from his first serve in a proper tournament. ""The ball hit the side of the racket and went straight in the water. That was terrible, terrible. But funny,"" Font recalls with a smile, breaking into laughter as he does throughout the interview. ""My coach says that the way I play, it's very stupid -- and smart at the same time. Stupid because many times I do the wrong shot, but I believe so much that it actually ends up working, so that's the smart part of it. ""In order to play beach tennis, you have to be fast. Not only in the legs, but in the reactions. ""You have to jump high, and you have to be prepared to commit mistakes, because mistakes happen every game."" On the tour, Font regularly partners Alex Mingozzi in men's doubles; the Italian is ranked just below him in fourth, while world champions Alessandro Calbucci and Marco Caravini have returned to joint top. ""The thing I love the most in beach tennis is the friendship you can have with other players. In tennis, I never had that,"" Font says. ""Sometimes I had very bad arguments, sometimes got in fights in tennis. In beach tennis I've never been even close to this. ""We shake hands when we cross sides. Win a tournament, lose a tournament in the final, we go out, we have a drink, we have a beer, we have a talk. We have dinner."" Font admits he has been seeking help from his psychologist to calm down his on-court attitude. ""I would get frustrated when my partner would make a mistake, and I would react really bad towards my partner,"" he says.","Vinicius Font is the first non-Italian player to be ranked No. 1 in beach tennis .

"London, England (CNN) -- When people say the message of Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" is as relevant today as it was in 1843, they usually have in mind Ebenezer Scrooge's conversion. Overnight, he's transformed from a mean old skinflint who believes that those unable to support themselves had better die ""and decrease the surplus population"" to an almost riotously generous giver to charitable causes. They remember especially, perhaps, Scrooge's change of heart toward his poor, underpaid clerk Bob Cratchit and how he promises to ensure that Bob will be able to afford the medical treatment that his beloved little son, the crippled Tiny Tim, will need if he is to survive -- a plot detail that resonates with particular strength in America today, where citizens struggle with health care costs. Less often remembered, though, is an eerie interlude that can easily be taken as a mirror of our own times: Scrooge's appalled encounter with the two fearful children, a boy and a girl, ""yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish,"" who emerge from the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present. The boy's name is Ignorance and the girl's is Want, and the ghost warns Scrooge to beware of them both -- but especially of the boy on whose brow is written ""that which is Doom, unless the writing be erased."" These fearful apparitions were products of Britain's ""Hungry Forties,"" when there was widespread economic distress and great fear of social breakdown, but it is part of Dickens' genius that he was recognizing here a theme that plays out everywhere, in every time and in every culture. It certainly does in today's America with unemployment running at 10 percent (or even higher in some areas) and fears that this could lead to increased crime, and arguably has led to a growing sense of intolerance -- for example, towards immigrant communities -- and political extremism. It may seem odd to include such grim reminders in a tale about Christmas. But Dickens knew about poverty: His own comfortable childhood was transformed when his father's overspending landed him and most of his family in a debtors' prison. As a boy, Dickens worked long hours for about a year in a small-scale factory and later drew on this experience, to him deeply degrading, in the early chapters of ""David Copperfield."" When not working he wandered about the streets of London, which he was later so richly to describe in ""Bleak House"" and his other great novels. For Dickens, building a system of national education (something frustrated in his day by bitter disputes between the different religious denominations) and reforming sanitary (or public health) laws were the two things needing urgent attention from the nation's lawmakers. He continued to fear the danger represented by the boy Ignorance, who re-appears in the last of his Christmas books, ""The Haunted Man"" (1848), as the savage street-child whom Redlaw, the protagonist, tries vainly to help. Of course, things gradually improved for Britain, as they eventually do in most big countries struggling to survive economic lows. In the 1850s and 1860s, as the country became more prosperous, the fear of chaos and revolution receded. Dickens dropped Ignorance and Want from his hugely popular public reading version of the ""Carol"" (performed from 1858 onward), though he never stopped calling attention to the national scandal of the scavenging hordes of starving, uncared-for street children in London and Britain's other great cities (the first Education Act, which brought in compulsory state education at the elementary level for all working-class children, was passed in the year of his death). Today, however, cities still confront gang activity and, as we witness a surge of political and religious extremism, we might wonder what Dickens would make of the situation. As someone who sought in his own journals to fight against the depraving effect of cheap sensational literature produced by those he called ""Panders to the basest passions of the lowest natures,"" he would certainly have been alarmed and horrified by the level of pop culture violence and quasi-pornography -- on TV, in magazines and video games. He would have seen this primarily as a failure of public education, I believe. Again, as someone who in his last novel, ""Edwin Drood,"" depicted a drug addict who turns to murder, he would have been equally appalled by the drug culture now so widespread among the young. The powerful presentation of Ignorance and Want in the latest cinematic version of his immortal ""A Christmas Carol"" would surely have struck him appropriate for our day. In the new Disney film a ferociously scowling Ignorance wields a lethal-looking knife, and Want is a teenage prostitute driven crazy, presumably by drug abuse. Disney brilliantly demonstrates that the urgent social warning Dickens sought to convey in the ""Carol"" in 1843 is quite as relevant to us today as is the story's more personal message about the need for us to open our ""shut-up hearts"" to our fellow men and give generously to those less well off than ourselves. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Slater .","Michael Slater: ""A Christmas Carol"" used Ignorance and Want to warn of poverty's effect .

"(CNN) -- Iran wants ""peace and friendship for all,"" the country's president said Wednesday while again denying Western assertions his nation is pursuing nuclear weapons and trying to destabilize Iraq. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad speaks at the Natanz nuclear facility in April. But Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took a hard line against Israel, calling it ""an invader"" and saying it ""cannot continue its life."" Asked if Iran had launched a proxy war in Iraq -- something the U.S. ambassador and top military commander there both asserted this week -- Ahmadinejad said the United States is merely seeking a scapegoat for its failing campaign in Iraq. ""Forces have come into Iraq and destroyed the security, and many people are killed,"" the Iranian president told Britain's ITN during an interview in the garden of the Iranian presidential palace in Tehran. ""And there are some claims that may seem very funny and ridiculous. Those who have lots of weaponry and warfare and thousands of soldiers -- if they are defeated, they blame others. There is no way to escape for peace."" Iranians do not believe in war and consider it a ""last resort,"" he said. He further claimed that Tehran is a friend of Iraq -- maintaining ""good relationships"" with the Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish factions -- and ""if Iraq is not secure, we are the first country that would be damaged."" He added, ""Responsible people should understand this: that Iran is against any sort of insecurity and attacks, and Iraq is able to defend themselves.""  Watch Ahmadinejad discuss issues affecting his country » . During the interview, Ahmadinejad struck a friendly tone toward Britain, saying he regretted that British soldiers have died in Iraq. ""We are sorry for your soldiers to be killed. We think peace should exist. Why should there be an invasion so that people will be killed?"" he asked. ""We want friendship -- friendship to all. We love all nations and all human beings. Anyone who is killed, we are against it."" Ahmadinejad urged the United States and Britain to reconsider the invasion of Iraq. The two countries should ""correct themselves,"" he said. If they don't, ""the defeat would repeat."" The Islamic republic could help improve conditions in Iraq, but first coalition forces must leave, he said. ""We can help solve many problems in Iraq. We can help secure Iraq. We can help the attackers leave Iraq if the American government and British government correct themselves."" he said. Ahmadinejad has said in the past that Tehran would fill any power vacuum left by a withdrawal of coalition forces in Iraq. The United States has cited the Iranian president's remarks as a reason to continue its efforts in Iraq. As for allegations that Tehran is pursuing a nuclear weapon, Ahmadinejad said he resents the notion that Iran ""has to obey whatever was put to us"" and asked why there is no similar furor over American and British nuclear programs. ""Our bombs are dangerous, but American bombs are not dangerous?"" he asked. When the ITN interviewer asked if he could tour the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran, Ahmadinejad chuckled and asked him if he thought the United States or Britain would allow Iran to inspect their nuclear facilities. ""We do not need a bomb. We are against bombs, actually. There are many reasons we are against it,"" he said. ""From a political point of view, it's not useful, we think."" The United Nations Security Council has so far imposed two rounds of limited sanctions against Iran for the country's refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment program. Tehran has insisted the program is meant for peaceful energy production. In regard to Israel, which Ahmadinejad has said should be politically ""wiped off the map,"" the Iranian president said there is a way to deal with the Jewish state without violence. Giving as an example the dissolution of the Soviet Union -- which he said came about ""without war"" -- Ahmadinejad suggested that ""everything would be solved"" if the Palestinian people were allowed to vote on their fate. However, his hard-line rhetoric resurfaced when Ahmadinejad said Israel ""cannot continue its life."" ""Israel is an invader and is cruel, and it hasn't got a united public. All other nations are against it,"" he said. ""We do not recognize them. They are attackers and illegal.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The growing outcry over how the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell deal with incidents of domestic violence has reached the nation's highest office. Even President Barack Obama has seen the footage of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice punching his then-fiancee. ""The President was shocked by what he saw. Let's put it that way,"" White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. The incident involving Rice is one of several high-profile scandals involving NFL players that have spurred complaints that the National Football League is too lenient on players. A few months after the Rice incident, Goodell suspended him without pay and fined him an additional game check. However, after the TMZ Sports video so clearly showed the forceful nature of the punch, Goodell suspended Rice indefinitely. Last week, the White House addressed the suspension with a statement saying the President believes domestic violence ""contemptible and unacceptable in a civilized society,"" but it wasn't clear whether he had seen the video of the incident from inside the elevator. McDonough said the White House wouldn't at this point try to characterize how the NFL is handling the Rice case. But he did speak generally about Rice's indefinite suspension. ""We all know that Ray Rice being suspended indefinitely seems to be exactly the right thing,"" McDonough said. Other lawmakers Sunday were far more critical of Goodell and the league. ""I have a feeling there's a lot of people that know stuff, what went on here,"" Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota told CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""I'm waiting to see if there is a major cover-up, if it shows [Goodell] lies, there could be many factual situations where, in fact, he should step down."" Klobuchar, a former prosecutor, is one of 16 female senators who sent a letter to Goodell calling on the football league to institute a ""real zero-tolerance policy"" in such cases. The NFL announced late Wednesday that former FBI Director Robert Mueller will lead an independent inquiry into the league's investigation and how it gathered evidence in the case. ""Bob Mueller's integrity is on the line here, and hopefully he'll get the facts out,"" Klobuchar said of the investigation. ""The fact that (the NFL) gave only a two-game suspension and then turn around and after the evidence goes public say, 'Oh, oh, we made a mistake. Now we're going to let him go.' I think that's problematic for the NFL and deeply concerning about how they handle these kinds of cases."" Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who also signed the letter to Goodell, had scathing words for the NFL. ""I think the way the NFL handled this was awful. It was outrageous,"" Gillibrand told CBS's ""Face the Nation."" ""They had all the facts they needed. They had a player who admitted to beating his wife. They had video of him dragging her out an elevator. There was nothing left to determine. That player should've been fired immediately. So we are now looking to the commissioner to enforce a zero-tolerance policy."" Gillibrand also said that if Goodell has covered up what he knew about the Rice incident, he should be benched. ""Initially, I want him to lead the reform to actually create and enforce a zero-tolerance policy. But, given the recent debate, you know, if he lied, if he lied to the American people, then he has to step down,"" she said, ""because he won't have the force of authority to change how they address these issues."" Gillibrand said the bipartisan letter from lawmakers to Goodell may be merely the beginning of a broader congressional push for more accountability in the NFL. ""If the NFL doesn't police themselves, then, you know, we will be looking more into it,"" she said. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we have hearings."" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, recently told CNN that he would not ""rule out"" congressional action to force the NFL's hand on domestic abuse. In the past, members of Congress have leveraged their titles and hearing rooms to press major U.S. sports leagues to face difficult issues. In 2007, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee released the landmark Mitchell Report on steroid use in Major League Baseball. Household names such as Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte were named, and MLB Commissioner Bud Selig responded that the report was a ""a call to action, and I will act."" Baseball fans would eventually see both Selig and Clemens, along with baseball titans Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Rafael Palmeiro and Jose Canseco, testify before Congress. Outcry over the NFL's response to the Rice incident has been compounded by two more recent incidents of domestic violence allegedly involving NFL players. Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings was indicted last week by a grand jury in Texas on a child abuse charge. Shortly afterward, he was placed on the inactive list for his team. The Carolina Panthers placed defensive end Greg Hardy on the team's inactive list in a surprise announcement Sunday, months after he was convicted of a domestic violence charge. Authorities say Hardy choked his then-girlfriend, threw her around, dragged her by her hair and threatened to kill her. Hardy -- 6-foot-4 and 275 pounds -- says he is innocent, and he has appealed a July guilty verdict rendered by a Mecklenburg County judge in North Carolina. Beyond the D.C. Beltway, California's second most powerful government official has called on the San Francisco 49ers to bench one of its own players involved in a domestic violence investigation. Ray McDonald, a starting defensive end, was arrested on felony domestic violence charges last month. ""The 49ers' continued insistence on playing Ray McDonald during his ongoing criminal investigation is a painful affront to every victim of domestic violence and sends a troubling message to our community,"" Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and his wife said in a statement. ""We strongly urge the 49er organization we grew up revering to do the right thing -- right now -- and bench Ray McDonald, pending the outcome of his felony domestic violence investigation by San Jose law enforcement."" McDonald told CNN affiliate KTVU last month that he couldn't say much about what happened. ""The truth will come out,"" he said. ""Everybody knows what kind of person I am ... a good-hearted person.""

"(Mashable) -- In a refreshingly honest statement, Samsung's mobile division VP Lee Don-Joo admitted that the iPad 2 made some parts of Samsung's 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab look ""inadequate,"" and the iPad 2's pricing might force Samsung to lower the price of its tablet. ""Apple made it very thin (...) We will have to improve the parts that are inadequate,"" Lee Don-Joo told Yonhap News Agency. We feel that a bit of information might have gotten lost in translation from Korean to English, as we definitely don't expect Samsung to pull the 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab from the market and release a thinner version. It's more likely that Samsung simply sees the iPad 2's thinness as a big challenge for its future tablet models. The other part of Lee Don-Joo's statement is clearer and far more telling. ""The 10-inch (tablet) was to be priced higher than the 7-inch, but we will have to think that over,"" he said. Samsung, unlike some of its competitors -- for example, the Motorola Xoom  -- won't try to compete with the iPad at a higher price point just because some of the hardware of its tablet looks better on paper and that, in our opinion, is the right approach. Apple has set the price for its tablet in the $499 -- $829 price range (with the cheapest 3G-sporting option being priced at $629), and any Android tablet will have a hard time competing with the iPad 2 at a price too near the upper end of that spectrum. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Barbara Walters isn't fully retiring, but ""The View"" has still given the veteran journalist a send-off to remember. On Friday's show, Oprah Winfrey, Hillary Clinton and Michael Douglas made surprise appearances as they all joined the current ""View"" co-hosts in wishing Walters well as she leaves on-camera work behind. ""I want to start by saying I can't believe this day has come and I can't believe it's for real,"" Clinton told Walters. ""Because I don't know what we're all going to do without seeing you go from one place to another, asking questions that we'd all like to ask."" True to form, Walters snuck in a few more of those questions Friday, asking Clinton whether she'll run for president. ""Well, I am running ... around the park,"" Clinton quipped. And when it came to Michael Douglas, who swore that Walters gives the best parties, the 84-year-old journalist couldn't help but inquire about the actor's relationship with wife Catherine Zeta-Jones, which hit a rough patch last summer. (These days, Douglas said, ""Catherine and I are wonderful."") With that much curiosity still evidently brimming, why is Walters leaving? Well, keep in mind that she's not leaving TV in general. She'll still serve as executive producer of ""The View,"" and will make special appearances for ABC News when needed. It's just that, as Walters said when she announced her retirement in May 2013, she has no interest in appearing on another TV program. CNNMoney: Barbara Walters is retiring but not going away . Walters began her national broadcast career in 1961 as a reporter, writer and panel member for NBC's ""Today"" show before being promoted to co-host in 1974. By 1976, ABC had snatched her up for its own news programs. At that network, Walters launched ""The Barbara Walters Specials"" and ""10 Most Fascinating People"" before becoming a co-host and correspondent for ABC News' ""20/20"" in 1984. Along the way, she's interviewed every U.S. president and first lady since Richard and Pat Nixon. Looking upon the numerous women who had looked up to her throughout her career, Walters said they were her legacy. ""How do you say goodbye to something like 50 years in television?"" she said in conclusion. ""How proud when I see all the young women who are making and reporting the news. If I did anything to help make that happen, that is my legacy. From the bottom of my heart, to all of you with whom I have worked and who have watched and been by my side, I can say: 'Thank you.' "" Ironically, one of the best-informed women in news had no idea what to expect for her farewell taping. ""Nobody told me what was going to happen today, so I couldn't plan for it,"" Walters told HLN's A.J. Hammer after the taping. ""Nobody told me that Hillary Clinton was going to show up. That line of women who said that maybe I inspired or influenced them? Nobody told me about that. Nobody told me that Oprah was going to come in! It was all just a wonderful surprise."" Still soaking it in, Walters reflected, ""I have to remember (all of this) on days that are not so great. I have to remember these women. I have to remember today.""

"(CNN) -- Valerie Trierweiler, ex-partner of French President Francois Hollande, settles some scores in a new book detailing their relationship. In ""Thank You For This Moment,"" released this week, the former French first lady describes the end of her seven-year romance with Hollande. It fell apart after pictures suggesting a liaison between Hollande and actress Julie Gayet were published in the French tabloid Closer in January. ""I am losing it. I don't want to hear this; I rush into the bathroom. I grab the little plastic bag containing sleeping pills,"" Trierweiler writes of her reaction to the pictures. She said Hollande snatched the bag of pills out of her hands. She later spent several days in the hospital, citing stress and fatigue. Trierweiler said she confronted Hollande twice about rumors of an affair, once in March 2013 and again that December. ""I asked him: Swear on my son's head that it's not true and I will never speak of it again,"" she writes. He swore, she writes, but he also called the rumors ""a load of nonsense."" She portrays the French President as a busy man who didn't have time for her anymore. She says she felt ""illegitimate"" and ""dehumanized"" after Hollande took over the presidency. She felt those around the President presented hurdles to the relationship, saying she was told once by a member of Hollande's communication team: ""If you want an evening with Francois, you need to pass it through me."" Trierweiler says the French President tried to win her back several times after the split. She describes a man who's constantly afraid to lose. ""He tells me he needs me,"" recalls Trierweiler in her book. ""Every night he asks me out for dinner. He said he would win me back as if I was an election."" Trierweiler and Hollande were never married. The French newspaper Le Parisien reports that Hollande was not aware of the book and was ""dismayed"" to hear news of its publication. This is not the first time that Hollande's private life has been the subject of headlines in French media. In 2007, he ended his relationship with Segolene Royal, now the ecology minister in his Socialist government. French media speculated that the split occurred because of Trierweiler. The book comes out at a time when Hollande's popularity has sagged. Excerpts from the book were published Thursday in the magazine Paris Match.

"(CNN) -- Nobody gave them a chance -- nobody. Perhaps nobody was listening. Perhaps they didn't want to. For all of the joking and laughing that Costa Rica would simply turn up in Brazil to make up the numbers, there were those who knew the reality would be different. ""Think big"" is the motto that Costa Rica coach Jorge Luis Pinto has always subscribed to. And the Colombian practices what he preaches -- qualification from the group stage was always going to be achieved if you speak to those within the Costa Rican camp. Bravado? A fool's hope? No, this is a side which plays with a belief that comes straight from the very top and trickles through the veins of its players. But it would be foolish to claim that this team has only succeeded because of the spirit which Pinto has engendered -- it has talent too, lots of it. Greece, also playing in the last 16 of the World Cup for the first time, fell the way of Uruguay and Italy on Sunday, beaten by a side playing with a confidence and belief that appears to be unshakable. With the game having reached penalty kicks following a 1-1 draw inside 120 minutes, both sets of players had already given everything they had. Costa Rica's players, who had already suffered the ignominy of having victory snatched away from them, appeared to be running through treacle as they dragged their tired limbs down the field, stretching every muscle and sinew. But having survived to make it through to penalties, those same players found the strength and skill to write yet another chapter in this incredible tale. All seven players had scored and, with his side trailing at 3-4 in the shootout, Theofanis Gekas strode towards the penalty spot. But there was a look in his eyes -- fear. Time appeared to stand still. The 34-year-old looked at the ball, looked at the goal -- but that look of trepidation never left his face. Perhaps Navas had noticed, perhaps he hadn't. It mattered little. For when Gekas stepped forward and placed the ball to the goalkeeper's right, Navas flew across to palm the ball away. History beckoned. Forward came Michael Umana -- a 31-year-old defender who plays in his home country with Deportivo Saprissa. He placed the ball down, a piece of grass stuck to his cheek courtesy of the sweat which dripped from his brow. He drew a breath. There was no shimmy, no stutter, no hesitation. As the ball hit the back of the net, those in white shirts forgot the aches and pains which had left their limbs in agony. Whereas moments ago they could barely walk, now those men draped in the flag of Costa Rica danced their way into the Brazilian night. ""Last night, I dreamed this,"" Umana told reporters. ""It seems untrue. I was relaxed because I dreamed it. I dreamed it but I didn't tell anyone. I felt very confident. ""This is for my family. It's for the colleagues who got injured before coming here. They're not with us, but they gave us a hand on the pitch."" In the end this proved to be a rather exciting contest -- a world away from what was served up in the opening 45 minutes. It was Greece that produced the only real opportunity eight minutes before the interval when Dimitris Salpingidis forced Navas into a fine reflex save from close range. At least the second half was better -- both sides dispensing with their cautious approaches and attempting to take the advantage. Giorgios Samaras tested Navas with a powerful header as Greece, which qualified following a dramatic late victory over the Ivory Coast, began to move forward with purpose. But just as it appeared that Greece was ready to take control, Costa Rica pounced. Captain Bryan Ruiz, the man whose goal saw off Italy, was the hero once again -- taking Cristian Bolanos' pass in his stride before carefully placing his effort beyond the reach of Orestis Karnezis in the Greek goal. That strike sparked scenes of jubilation on the touchline with Pinto, animated at the best of times, celebrating his team's latest success. Having only conceded once in three previous games, Costa Rica's defense looked more than comfortable as Greece attempted a fightback. But with 24 minutes remaining, disaster struck for Los Ticos. Duarte, one of the team's most dependable members, rushed into a challenge on Jose Cholevas, taking out the Greek player and earning himself a second yellow card. As referee Ben Williams held the red card aloft, Duarte left the pitch almost inconsolable, leaving behind his 10 teammates to try to hang on. And hold out it did -- Costa Rica's tenacious approach kept goalkeeper Navas almost unemployed as the clock began to tick down. But just as its players began to dream of the quarterfinals, Greece, one of the most belligerent teams in international football, proved why it remains so difficult to beat. With 90 minutes up, substitute Gekas' low shot was only parried by Navas and Papastathopoulous lashed home. While the Costa Ricans fell to their knees, those in blue continued the onslaught knowing its opponent had been wounded. It might have even won it inside the 90 minutes had it not been for a wonderful save by Navas, somehow reaching to tip Kostas Mitroglou's header over the crossbar. With neither side able to find the elusive winning goal, the tie moved into 30 minutes of extra time. As Costa Rica began to tire, it was Greece which took control and Mitroglou was denied a dramatic late winner by Navas when the striker looked certain to score. That ensured the tie would be decided on penalties and when Gekas had his effort saved, Umana stood up to rewrite history. A tie with the Netherlands in Salvador next Saturday is the reward for this Costa Rican team -- a game in which no doubt it will be written off once again. But for now Costa Rica's players will do what they've done from the very start. They'll ""think big.""","Costa Rica defeats Greece 5-3 on penalties .

"(CNN) -- In the United States, we don't vacation often. And thanks to our ever-growing cadre of mobile gadgets, some experts fear that we don't vacation very well, either. Smartphones, laptops, tablet computers and other devices make it easier than ever to stay plugged in all the time. That's not exactly news. But there's a growing awareness, and concern, that the same items designed to keep us engaged and entertained around the clock can also make it harder for us to ever actually relax. Sure, we're on vacation at the shore, or a peaceful lakeside cabin in the woods. But it can't hurt to whip out the laptop and check work e-mail real quickly, right? You know, just in case something big happened back at the office. Maybe you can't resist peeking at your phone to see what your co-workers are up to on Facebook. Or, you know, to get in a quick round of Words With Friends, or a game of Qrank during that long sunset stroll on the beach. And never mind how many miles there are between you and the office. In 2011, your boss knows you're always just an electronic nudge away. As part of our No Vacation Nation series, we talked to two authors: Daniel Sieberg, writer of ""The Digital Diet"" and William Powers, author of ""Hamlet's BlackBerry: A Practical Philosophy for Building a Good Life in the Digital Age."" Both books address finding a healthy balance in our use of technology. The authors shared some tips on how to keep your gadget in check while on vacation. On why it's important . Sieberg: If you respond to one (work) e-mail, you've just opened the floodgates. You've lost that barrier -- it's gone like a sandcastle in front of the ocean. Now that person knows that you're really not on vacation. You are reachable and you will respond. Hold onto that. Otherwise, it's just a slippery slope to just responding to everything. ... It's not giving you that clarity in your head that you're seeking from a vacation -- the reason you did it in the first place. Powers: It feels like a small thing we're doing. ""I'll just check Facebook"" or ""I'll just go into this one little game I like to do."" What we forget is that it actually takes you into a different state of mind. It's a different type of consciousness, the digital one. That may not be true in 20 years, when we've adjusted to it. But it is now. Create rules for when you can use gadgets . Sieberg: Say, 'Thirty minutes is what I'm going to do.' Then close it down. Put it away. Give it to somebody else. Powers: The No. 1 thing is to set up rituals for yourself and stick to it. It could be once a day. It could be twice in a week. But set those times ahead of time and stick to it. Get friends, family to help . Powers: Get other people, the people you're traveling with, to work with you. Work with each other on it and support each other. You can make it a game. If one person takes the plunge back into 'screen life,' it's easy to follow them. Ban gadgets during meals . Sieberg: No throwing the smartphone out on the table if you're out to dinner or just having family time. It's really valuable keeping them put away for that period of time. If it has to be out, acknowledge it. Let everybody know why it has to be out. If you must get extreme . If you think no amount of planning will be enough to resist the urge to text, tweet, blog or browse, Powers suggests you try intentionally planning trips to places where coverage will be spotty -- or nonexistent. Or, he says, you can emulate a guy who called in to a radio show he was on once. Before he leaves on vacation, the guy gives all his passwords and user names to friends who he trusts. One person gets e-mail. One person gets Twitter. One person gets Facebook. They're under orders, on the day he leaves, to go in and change the passwords. When he returns, they change them back. Don't necessarily go cold turkey . Sieberg: Even if we say we're not going to use them, we're not going to leave them at home. You worry about an emergency. You worry about that work e-mail that you just can't miss. It's not about getting rid of technology. It's about managing your technology more carefully. Powers: These devices are wonderful.

"(CNN) -- The international Fashion Week crowd has packed up its tents and menagerie of models in New York and moved on to London. After that, it's Milan and finally, Paris. Meanwhile those unfamiliar to the Lincoln Center Fashion Week tents, where runway shows and designer presentations take over the city twice a year, are left wondering in a dust of sequins and a lingering cloud of Chanel No. 5: Why all the fashionable fuss? How does Fashion Week impact me and what I wear daily? ""On a strictly business level, it's a $350 million a year business,"" said Steven Kolb, the CEO of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. ""It's the second largest industry in New York City after finance. It isn't just these design jobs, it's the retail jobs, it's the truckers who drive the deliveries around to stores, it's the editors. It's a big, big business."" Particularly in New York, Fashion Week is more for the benefit of the buyers, or the people who decide what items to stock in department stores or boutiques for the upcoming season. From there, Fashion Week designs will eventually trickle down into mass market retail. Garments that debuted on the runway this week may not be hanging from the racks of your local T.J.Maxx anytime soon, but you'll see their influence in the shades, patterns and cuts of mass produced items. If the nearly 200 designers who showcased their lines during Fashion Week are any indication, by spring, the masses will be wearing skirt suits, sheer overlays, blush tones, edgy prints, sexy cutouts and head scarves. Tamara Albu, an associate professor of fashion design at Parsons The New School of Design, said even for consumers who are ""just not that into it,"" -- it being fashion -- the industry's influence is unavoidable. ""Whether we like it or not, whether we want it or not, we are constantly bombarded by information, which, of course, includes fashion,"" she said. ""The manufacturers may translate those specific details to more affordable versions that may be trickled down to mass production garments soon after the shows are over. Being totally oblivious about fashion elements would not exclude the fashion from an uninterested person's wardrobe,"" she said. Insiders assert the pomp, circumstance and air kisses of Fashion Week don't just matter to the economy and your closet; they encourage creativity just like events that celebrate any other medium, such as music or fine art. ""It's not just frivolous. It's an entire industry of ideas and marrying the art of commerce with it,"" said Anne Kwon Keane, fashion director for Lucky magazine. And while most runway looks, like the pink feathered Badgley Mischka gown or Tracy Reese's sequined pants, may seem a little extravagant for the business casual set, Keane, Kolb and Albu agree, there's still a takeaway: silhouettes, textures, colors, tailoring details and ideas on how to accessorize. ""It's a presentation of ideas and when thoughtfully put forward the impact can be really wide-reaching,"" Keane said. ""It can be whatever it needs to be to a consumer no matter the price point and that person's personality,"" Kolb said. Others, like New York-based photographer Mike Mellia, remain skeptical. On Thursday, Mellia will open his latest exhibition, ""The Death of Fashion,"" which questions whether Fashion Week ""has become an anonymous repeating stereotype."" Still Mellia acknowledges fashion's power. ""Fashion's goal is to place itself on an aspirational pedestal because it seeks to transform art into commerce. As a result, the social reach of fashion is often greater than that of traditional art in today's society,"" Mellia said. Are you a fashionista, or do you find the fashion industry irrelevant?

"(CNN) -- The terrorists who attacked the In Amenas gas complex in eastern Algeria appear to have been of several nationalities, and may have trained in jihadist camps across the border in southern Libya, according to sources familiar with the situation there. Read more: Power struggle: The North African gas industry targeted by militants . Algerian security sources told Reuters late Thursday that the militants whose bodies had been recovered from the complex so far included three Egyptians, two Tunisians, two Libyans, a Malian and a French citizen.

Read more: 'Mr. Marlboro': The veteran jihadist behind the attack in Algeria . Libyan authorities have been aware for some time of the existence of three militant camps south of the desert town of Sabha, not far from the Algerian border, a regional security source told CNN. The source said the leader of one of those camps was a Libyan veteran of the 1980s Afghan war. Western intelligence officials had established that the man had met Moktar Belmoktar -- the overall leader of the group that assigned al Barra to carry out the attack -- during a trip Belmoktar made to Libya late in 2011. The source said the three camps include jihadists from Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania and Mali as well as ethnic Tuaregs, and that it was highly possible that these camps were connected to the attack. Read more: Islamists take foreign hostages in attack on Algerian oil field . A former head of intelligence for the Transitional National Council in Libya also confirmed to CNN that he was aware of three camps in the area. Rami El Obeidi said the camps had been operational for about a year and confirmed that foreign fighters had been among the militants training there. El Obeidi also said that extremist militia in Libya were financing militant groups in Mali and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb as well as providing them with logistical support. Read more: Six reasons events in Mali matter . The former intelligence chief said the Libyan army had little capability in this vast area of desert and there was a fear of confronting the extremists. With the French intervention in Mali, he said ""a Pandora's Box has been opened"" -- and he believed oil fields in Libya were also at high risk of being attacked. Foreign oil companies have gradually returned to Libya since the 2011 revolution that ousted Moammar Gadhafi, but much of Libya remains highly insecure and under the sway of independent militia.

A Salafist group in eastern Libya has called for protests after Friday prayers in Benghazi in response to the French intervention in Mali -- posting on its Facebook page that ""Mali is bleeding"" because of the French involvement. El Obeidi said that al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb treated the whole region as one theater and was oblivious to the desert borders that divided the countries of the Sahel. North African media have described Abou al-Barra as the one of the most effective commanders of the Al-Mulathameen Brigade that is led by Belmoktar.

The group was held responsible for the kidnap of more than 30 European tourists in Algeria. A Mauritanian news agency -- Alakhbar -- named another of the attackers killed as Zarghawi Al-Mouritani,18. His real name was Abdallahi Ould Hmeida, the agency said. CNN is unable to verify the report of his death. The Algerian Communications Minister, Mohamed SaÃ¯d, told state media late Thursday that the terrorist attack was the work of a multinational group of terrorists whose aim was to implicate Algeria in the conflict in Mali, destabilize the Algerian state and destroy the Algerian economy, which is heavily reliant on oil and gas revenues. Other Algerian officials have repeated that there would be no negotiations with such groups.

"(CNN) -- Reality TV may prove to be a golden ticket for Clay Aiken's congressional bid. Nearly a decade ago, Americans were introduced to the adorable schoolteacher from North Carolina. Aiken wowed viewers and judges early in the second season auditions of ""American Idol."" No one expected such an incredible voice to come out of such an unassuming package. He came out of nowhere and stole the show. His singing won him a golden ticket to Hollywood, but his resolve won him a unique place in the hearts of American viewers. And that could be just the training he needed for his next career. This week, Aiken once again presented himself as an unassuming candidate, this time jumping into North Carolina politics as a Democrat to challenge U.S. Rep. Renee Ellmers, a Republican, for her 2nd Congressional District seat. As a former political appointee and reality TV show participant, I am intrigued by Aiken's foray into the world of politics. He and I got our start on TV right around the same time. In all of my encounters with him over the last decade, I have found him to be kind, warm and authentic. I bet the voters in North Carolina will see the same thing. A friend asked me if I thought Aiken's TV background would help or hurt him in his congressional race. That's easy. National TV has uniquely prepared Aiken for this adventure into politics. Here's why. Aiken has had to convince millions to vote for him -- first via a toll-free 866 number and soon in a voting booth. He has had to deflect the barbs of critics -- I'm not sure who is worse, Simon Cowell or Sean Hannity. And he has had to learn how to win over the media -- first in Hollywood, now inside the Beltway. Back in 2003 and 2004, reality TV was a lot different. Aiken and I both were parts of instantly successful franchises at the peak of their popularity. Each week, millions of viewers tuned in not only to watch but also to vote for their choices -- or vote off whom they didn't like. This created a new entertainment democracy. Viewers were empowered to choose their favorites, and contestants had to campaign and compete for a spot on the show -- and for the hearts of America on an unofficial campaign trail. Reality TV requires you to have thick skin. When you have to face harsh critics such as Cowell or Donald Trump weekly, you have no choice but to be tough. But the toughest critic of all proved to be the American public. Aiken was subjected to intense, relentless scrutiny. He was forced to learn and apply leadership principles that were essential to his longevity and success, on screen and off. And even when he got knocked down, he had to get back up and fight again. There are skills that we learned being on a reality show that may help Aiken win. First, his message, which he has already tried and tested during his ""American Idol"" days, will get refined in the political arena. He proudly shared Christian beliefs and his passion for young people with special needs, both traits that resonated with viewers -- and likely with North Carolina voters. Secondly, his relationship with the media during ""Idol"" taught him how to deal with them in a smart, shrewd yet upfront and sincere way. The press can spot a fake a mile away. On ""American Idol,"" he quickly learned to forge relationships with the media to connect with those who would cast their votes each week. In his congressional race, he will likely be able to reach voters in ways that his competitor can't. Because of his TV training, he already knows how to do so. Lastly, his two previous losses -- he came in second place behind Ruben Studdard during the second season of ""Idol"" and placed second behind Arsenio Hall in the fifth season of ""Celebrity Apprentice"" -- could prove to be just the hook in his bid for Congress. Going up against an incumbent in a traditionally Republican district, voters will see Aiken as the underdog and may rally behind him. Voters may feel that his time has come. And everyone roots for the underdog. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Omarosa Manigault.","Ex-""Apprentice"" star Omarosa Manigault says reality TV was good training for Clay Aiken .

Cera is no novice when it comes to music: He's sung backup vocals and played some on a Weezer track and jammed with the indie rock group Mister Heavenly. The Daily Beast called it ""a mix of instrumental tracks, lovely ballads and solemn covers"" and compares (perhaps tongue-in-cheek) his project to Beyonce's surprise album.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- An expatriate corporate investigator has been sentenced to two and a half years in a Chinese jail after being found guilty of stealing and selling personal information for profit, Chinese state media has reported. His wife and business partner was also found guilty of the same charge and was handed a two-year prison sentence. Briton Peter Humphrey, who has been in detention since July 2013, appeared in a Shanghai court on Friday at the same time as his wife and business partner Yu Yingzeng. Yu is a Chinese-born U.S. citizen. According to a court statement quoted by official news agency Xinhua, the pair confessed to obtaining private information about Chinese citizens by ""illegal means."" They said they would write reports based on this information and sell them to multinational companies. In court, Humphrey said that he had conducted a two-month investigation on behalf of GlaxoSmithKline's China management into who had filed formal allegations of bribery against the company, Xinhua reported. Chinese police have accused GSK executives in China of presiding over a web of corruption and bribery. GSK has said its China business is fully cooperating with the ongoing investigation. In a July 3 statement, GSK said it had hired Humphrey's firm in April 2013 to conduct an investigation following a serious breach of privacy and security related to the company's China general manager. Humphrey is a veteran corporate detective -- an investigator, similar to a private detective, but one which sniffs out corporate malfeasance -- who spent more than 20 years as a foreign correspondent with Reuters, including stints in Beijing and Eastern Europe. ChinaWhys, the investigations consultancy that Yu and Humphrey established, assisted in assessing corporate risks, conducting background checks and investigating allegations of corruption and fraud. The couple's son, who attended court, had told CNN that he believed it would be easier for his parents if they pleaded guilty. ""I'm hoping it will be a situation where they plead guilty and they go for a mitigation defense strategy, and just try to make it as lenient a sentencing as possible,"" he said before the trial.","Peter Humphrey and wife Yu Yingzeng sentenced to at least two years in prison .

"(CNN) -- If you've ever been hit with one, you know how an unexpected ""resort fee"" can take your breath away. At up to $30 a night, the dollars quickly add up when you spend a few nights in a hotel that charges a mandatory fee for amenities that might include the use of the property's gym or pool. The element of surprise that accompanies some of these mandatory fees has caught the attention of the Federal Trade Commission, which recently sent a letter to 22 hotel operators warning that their online rate quotes may be deceptive and in violation of FTC regulations. The commission found that some of the hotel operators it addressed list only the room rate and taxes in online rate quotes, while listing mandatory fees separately either nearby or on another page, while other hotels list the fees in fine print or don't list additional fees at all, indicating only that other fees may apply. Hotels ready for the end of the world . ""These practices may violate the law by misrepresenting the price consumers can expect to pay for their hotel rooms,"" the commission's letter to hoteliers said. ""We believe that online hotel reservation sites should include in the quoted total price any unavoidable or mandatory fees, such as resort fees, that consumers will be charged to stay at the hotel."" The FTC declined to name the hotel operators that received the letter. ""This is the first time the FTC has publicly stated its position that it is deceptive for the hotels not to include mandatory fees as part of the total price they quote. We want to give the hotel operators an opportunity to come into compliance voluntarily before naming them publicly,"" said commission spokeswoman Betsy Lordan via e-mail. A hotel for every taste: Fodor's top 100 . Charging mandatory fees for amenities that are included at many hotels is a balancing act for hoteliers, according to Howard Adler, a professor of hotel management at Purdue University. Hotels make money on resort fees, but they can lead to customer dissatisfaction and loss of business, he said via e-mail. ""Guest satisfaction is a very costly issue for hotels to deal with since (consumers) have so many choices and brand loyalty is fleeting at best,"" Adler said. Guests who are surprised by fees when the bill arrives can be especially troubled by them. The trade commission encouraged the hotel operators to review their online price quoting procedures warning that the FTC ""may take action to enforce and seek redress for any violations of the FTC Act as the public interest may require."" So guests will still have to pay the fees, but chances are, you'll know about them before the bill is slipped under the door. Business or pleasure? Luxury hotels offer day-only rooms .

"(CNN) -- Lawmakers drew battle lines for a fresh round of sparring over U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl after a classified briefing Monday on the prisoner swap that led to his release. Authorities released an update about his condition. And more details emerged about his time in captivity. Details about why he disappeared off a military base nearly five years ago and ended up in Taliban hands remain murky. One thing is clear: the political debate over Bergdahl's release is showing no signs of dying down. Here's a cheat sheet on the latest developments, based on CNN's reporting: . After classified briefing, lawmakers have 'more concerns' Monday it was the House of Representatives' turn to hear the Obama administration's explanation of how it handled Bergdahl's case, as top White House deputies tried to convince lawmakers they made the right call when they didn't notify Congress in advance about the controversial exchange of Bergdahl for five Taliban figures. But it didn't seem like many minds were changed after the classified briefing, CNN's Dana Bash reported. ""If anything, I have more concerns,"" said Rep. Peter King, R-New York. ""Probably the most distressing thing or the most disturbing thing I heard was at least 80 to 90 people in the administration were aware of this proposed deal, and yet they couldn't notify anyone in Congress."" After Monday's briefing, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said that figure was the number of people in the administration authorized to get intelligence information about the Taliban in Qatar. ""The specifics of the detainee exchange and the related military operation were more closely held,"" she said. Why wasn't Congress told about the deal beforehand? Lawmakers at Monday's briefing said they were told concerns over possible leaks made the White House keep them in the dark over the deal. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, told CNN's ""Erin Burnett: Outfront"" that the White House should have told congressional leaders, even if the law gave them wiggle room. ""I think the President had the constitutional authority ... to make this decision without consulting with Congress, but I think it would have been wiser, far wiser, for the administration to have notified certainly the leadership of Congress in the interest of having good relations,"" he said. ""Most of the leaks that have taken place have come from the administration and not from Congress,"" he added, ""so they really should have brought at least the leadership within their confidence, and I think that was a mistake."" And that's not all. Some lawmakers are also steamed about the terms of the deal. They say they're worried that the five Taliban figures released could end up back on the battlefield -- a concern administration officials have downplayed in their public comments defending the deal. Don't expect the sparring to stop any time soon. A briefing of the Senate Armed Services Committee is scheduled for Tuesday. And the real fireworks are expected to come Wednesday, when Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is scheduled to testify before the House Armed Services Committee, where he'll likely face questions about the administration's decision not to seek congressional input on the deal that secured Bergdahl's release. Bergdahl hasn't spoken to his parents yet . Bergdahl is ""continuing to improve every day"" as he recovers at a military hospital in Germany, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said Monday . But he hasn't spoken with his family yet. The ""decision to speak with the family is a decision the returnee has to make when he or she is emotionally in the right place to make the phone call,"" Warren said. Doctors at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, where Bergdahl was taken after his handover, have said he's in stable condition but not ready yet to travel to the United States. ""There is no predetermined timeline for Sgt. Bergdahl's recovery process,"" a hospital statement said Friday. ""The duration will continue to be based on the pace of his healing and reintegration process."" When he is ready, Bergdahl will be flown to the San Antonio Military Medical Center in Texas, where he may be able to reunite with his parents. He was kept in a cage . As Bergdahl recovers, details are slowly emerging about the conditions he endured during five years of captivity. Citing an American official, The New York Times reported Sunday that Bergdahl told medical staff that the box he was kept in for weeks at a time was pitch black and like a shark cage. CNN reported Friday that Bergdahl has said he was kept in a small box after trying to escape, according to a senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of not being identified. The official also told CNN that Bergdahl suffers from psychological trauma caused by physical abuse. A Taliban source with knowledge of Bergdahl's captivity told CNN's Nic Robertson on Sunday that Bergdahl escaped at one point and was on the run for three days. When he was recaptured after that attempt, according to the Taliban source, he was not punished with a cage or cell, but was taken to a more secure location where he had no chance to escape. A U.S. official told CNN last week that Bergdahl may have tried to escape his Taliban captors on at least two occasions. He wants to be recognized by his old rank . The Times report added that Bergdahl has taken walks outside his hospital room while wearing his Army uniform, according to the American official. Bergdahl, who was promoted twice on schedule while in captivity, objects to being called sergeant, the Times reported. Bergdahl said he wants to be recognized by his old rank, a senior U.S. official told CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr on Sunday. Bergdahl was a private first class when he went missing on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan's Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. ""In his mind, he's a Pfc,"" the official told Starr. His parents have received threats . The FBI is investigating threats against Bergdahl's parents, who have not been seen publicly since sending their son messages of love through a news conference days after his release. ""We are working jointly with our state and local partners and taking each threat seriously,"" FBI Special Agent William Facer told CNN in an e-mail Saturday. Facer declined to detail the nature and severity of the threats, and a military representative for the Bergdahls declined to comment. Bergdahl's father received threats in three messages via e-mail at his home, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the contents of the e-mail. The first threat came on Wednesday, the official said, adding that FBI investigators will be tracing the messages to pinpoint who sent them. Since Bergdahl's release, critics, including a former member of his unit, have contended that Bergdahl deserted. The Army concluded in a 2009 report that he left his post deliberately. But the Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something Army officials can't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official told CNN. CNN's Elise Labott, Barbara Starr, Kevin Liptak, Jake Tapper, Qadir Sediqi, Ed Lavandera, Devon Sayers, Shimon Prokupecz, Deirdre Walsh, Ashleigh Banfield and Chloe Sommers contributed to this report.","NEW: Lawmakers say they're still skeptical after a briefing on Sgt.

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN)  -- Federal authorities have charged a Louisiana man with threatening to kill President Bush. President Bush, seen Tuesday, was the subject of a Louisiana man's death threat, police say. A social worker who met with Gregory Broussard in an emergency room last month told Secret Service agents that Broussard had threatened to kill Bush and blow up the White House, according to an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint. The circumstances of Broussard's visit to the emergency room were not immediately clear. Broussard is expected to appear in court Tuesday afternoon. Prosecutors will ask that he be detained, according to a written statement from the U.S. attorney's office in the Eastern District of Louisiana. Broussard, of Hammond, Louisiana, told agents during an interview at a behavioral hospital that he knew how to make napalm and was a pyromaniac, according to the affidavit. He also said he had traveled in December to the site of Huey P. Long's assassination at the state capitol in Baton Rouge and to the governor's mansion in preparation for protecting President-elect Barack Obama if he ever were to visit, according to the affidavit. Long, then a Louisiana senator and former governor of the state, was fatally shot in 1935. If convicted, Broussard would face five years in prison and a fine of $250,000.","Louisiana man threatened to kill Bush, social worker says, according to affidavit .

"(CNN) -- Want to get an iPhone 5 on Friday? You'll probably need to wait in line. Or pay someone to do it for you. Hipster-looking shoppers already have plopped down in folding chairs outside Apple's flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York. And in San Francisco, a man working through a micro-tasking company (more on what that means in a second) has been diligently waiting in line, for a price, since Monday. ""You're going to wait here until Friday? God watch over you,"" a stranger told that person, who was using a service called TaskRabbit, according to his Twitter feed. Massive demand awaits Friday's iPhone 5 sale . TaskRabbit nabbed the first-in-line spot to try to promote its online service that allows people to pay someone else to do a menial task for them. In this case, according to CNET, you can find people online who for about $40 to $150 will stand in line to purchase the iPhone 5 on your behalf. That sort of idea isn't all that new, and line-standers also are offering their services on craigslist. ""If you are looking to buy the iPhone 5 when it is released, but not looking to stand in the line. I'll do it for you!"" wrote one person in Los Angeles. ""I'll get in line at 6 a.m. for 40 bucks. Camp overnight for 70,"" wrote another stander, this one from the San Francisco Bay Area. Other people are posting craigslist ads asking others to stand in line for them. One such ad, in Los Angeles, says the patron will offer the stander ""a reasonable amount"" ... ""and on top of that, I'll even buy you breakfast."" CNN iReport: Lining up for an iPhone 5? For those who don't want to spend even more than the hefty price tag for the iPhone, but do want to pick up a phone on Friday, perhaps the line is the way to go. Unless you hopped online within the first hour or so last Friday, pre-ordered iPhones aren't expected to arrive for weeks. But plan to get up early on Friday morning. While opening-day iPhone lines vary by location -- what passes as early enough at a Radio Shack in Nevada may not work for an Apple store in New York -- analysts generally say advance consumer demand for the iPhone 5 is outpacing previous models. Early reviews of the phone have been positive. Apple recently announced it had received 2 million pre-orders for the new phone, which is taller, faster, lighter and slimmer than the previous model, the iPhone 4S. That's about double what the company experienced for the previous iPhone, Apple said. That could foreshadow long lines. Or it could mean more consumers are skipping the line-waiting game and, instead, have chosen to order the phone online. iPhone 5 pre-order shipping dates pushed back . The line waits are part exercise in extreme consumerism, part homage to Apple. Last year some of the line-standers made pilgrimages to Apple stores in part out of a sense of tribute to Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who died a week before the phone went on sale.

"(CNN) -- It's a sport made up of birdies and eagles, so perhaps it's no surprise that a large South American flightless bird has found a home away from home at a rural English golf club. The rhea -- similar in appearance to an ostrich -- disappeared from a pen at its owner's home five weeks ago in the town of Brent Pelham in Hertfordshire. Attempts to track it down are focused on the area surrounding Barkway Park Golf Club near the town of Royston, roughly five miles away. With its top speed approaching 40 miles per hour, catching the four-foot-tall rhea, which has been spotted dashing along the greens and fairways, sounds like a task too far for even sprinter Usain Bolt. But local golfers and staff at Barkway aren't too concerned. Many have welcomed media who have descended on the club and taken to snapping pictures of the rhea when it appears from the miles of fields surrounding the 18-hole course. ""We've had everybody and his brother down here,"" said one senior member who asked not to be named for fear of being bombarded with media requests. ""The greenkeepers have had little videos on (their) phones and they've sold them. ""Obviously it's a bird that's escaped and it's all over the place. It's not in one particular place."" Animal welfare charity the RSPCA has been reportedly warning members of the public about approaching the rhea, stating that the birds have extremely sharp claws and the potential to be dangerous if they feel threatened. But not all are convinced of the danger. ""The papers have made it a man-killer, it's ridiculous what they are saying,"" said the Barkway member, referring to alarmist stories that have appeared in print and on television segments. ""It's not dangerous in any way, shape or form. They (media) have made all that up. If you get within about 20 or 30 yards of it, it just runs away. If you cornered it in some way it might turn on you but that happens with anything."" Dangerous or not, what plans are in place to catch the runaway bird? ""They can't capture it, they don't even know how,"" the Barkway member said. Unless, that is, the birds and the bees play a helping hand. ""It's a female, as it happens, but the only way you're going to catch is if you've got a male,"" the golfer said. ""When it comes into the mating season and the male starts doing whatever it does, then you'll (apparently) be alright.""

"(CNN) -- In yet another sign of the gravity of Chicago's violent crime problem, 40 Illinois State Police officers will soon hit the streets in beleaguered neighborhoods. The officers represent an expansion of a partnership between Chicago Police and the Illinois State Police. ""Earlier this year I told (Chicago) Mayor (Rahm) Emanuel we would help in any way we could to combat violence in the city. When he requested assistance, I immediately agreed to help,"" Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn said in a press release announcing the move. The 40 officers will join the Chicago Police Department's Fugitive Unit and help search for wanted criminals. ""I'm proud to bring so many partners together to focus on real solutions that will help ensure every child in every neighborhood has the safety and opportunities they deserve,"" Emanuel said in a press release. The additional officers are expected to be added in the next 30 days. Chicago is suffering through an awful summer of violent shootings. Over the Fourth of July weekend alone more than 60 people were shot and nine were killed. The state police and Chicago Police will form ""surge"" teams with five Chicago Police officers and two state troopers, according to the press release from Quinn's office. The teams will work to find known violent criminals in an effort to get them off of the streets of Chicago. The expanded partnership will be funded with current state police resources. And at the city level, steps have been taken to get more boots on the ground. Last week, Chicago Police Superintendent Garry F. McCarthy ordered 150 officers to be taken off of administrative jobs and added to street patrol, Monday through Thursday, CNN affiliate WLS reported. In addition to heightened police forces, the city is also taking a softer approach to quell crime. A local supermarket chain will provide food for Faith in Action community events. These events, hosted by community and faith groups, take place in neighborhoods most impacted by violence. After Faith in Action events were held over Memorial Day, there were no shootings in Chicago for 42 hours, according to a statement from the mayor's office. ""I am very pleased that Mayor Emanuel has committed to a community process to address our public safety challenges,"" said the Rev. Dr. L. Bernard Jakes of the West Point Missionary Baptist Church in Chicago. ""He is listening and responding.""

"(CNN) -- Jesse Owens' 1936 gold medal sold for $1,466,574 at auction Sunday, setting a record for the highest price ever paid for Olympic memorabilia. New owner Ron Burkle, a billionaire investor and co-owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team, plans to use it for a future educational tour of historic pieces. This medal is considered one of the most important in Olympics history and is one of four Owens won at the 1936 games in Berlin, spoiling Adolf Hitler's planned showcase of Aryan superiority. Imagine the shock to Nazi Party elites when a black American, the son of a sharecropper and a grandson of slaves, stared down fascist propaganda, bested his rivals and took home four gold medals.

Owens won the 100- and 200-meter sprints, the long jump and ran the opening leg for the winning 4x100-meter U.S. relay team. ""It leaves one nearly speechless to behold this medal. It survives as one of the world's most poignant symbols of triumph,"" the vice president of SCP Auctions, Dan Imler, said in a statement. No one knows where the other three original medals are, the auction house said. Owens gave this medal to friend Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson a few years after the Olympics, and the late entertainer's widow, Elaine Plaines-Robinson, sold the medal, the auction house said.

"(CNN) -- A memo reportedly written two years ago by Maj. Nidal Hasan's supervisor at Walter Reed Army Medical Center says the accused Fort Hood shooter demonstrated ""a pattern of poor judgment and a lack of professionalism"" during his residency at the hospital. National Public Radio obtained what it said is a copy of the memo, posting on NPR.org  a retyped version that the network said was a ""transcript"" of the memo and ""not a facsimile or PDF of the actual document."" ""The faculty has serious concerns about CPT Hasan's professionalism and work ethic,"" said the memo, signed by Maj. Scott Moran, the residency program's director. ""Clinically he is competent to deliver safe patient care. But he demonstrates a pattern of poor judgment and a lack of professionalism."" Read document obtained by NPR . CNN could not corroborate the authenticity of the memo nor reach Moran for comment. Last week, Moran said he could not comment about differing accounts of Hasan's behavior and disciplinary record. Hasan's supervisor at Fort Hood Army Post, Col. Kimberly Kesling, has said that Hasan's evaluations from Walter Reed contained some information that concerned her, but the concerns triggered an approach to integrate Hasan into the staff that she said had been successful. ""The types of things that were reported to me via his evaluation report were things that concerned me, but did not raise red flags toward this [the shootings] in any way, shape or form,"" she said, adding that Hasan ""was doing a really good job for us."" Hasan, still hospitalized in Texas, has been charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder in the November 5 shooting at Fort Hood. The memo obtained by National Public Radio said that Hasan, then a captain, was ""counseled for inappropriately discussing religious topics"" with patients and went through a remediation program for inappropriate documentation of his handling of a homicidal patient during an emergency room encounter. The document said Hasan's remediation on that problem was successful but added that he was placed on administrative probation at the end of the year for not taking and passing the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination. He later corrected that problem as well, the memo said. The memo also noted a poor attendance record and lower-than-expected scores on the Psychiatry Resident-In-Training Examination, a yearly exam that Hasan failed to take during one of his residency years. In his final year of residency, the memo said, Hasan saw 30 patients in 38 weeks and was required to use elective class time to make up the lost clinic time. And, it said, he missed a night of emergency room on-call duty and did not respond to Moran's pages the next day. ""These issues demonstrate a lack of professionalism and work ethics,"" the memo said. ""He is able to self-correct with supervision. However, at this point he should not need so much supervision."" The memo concluded, however, that Hasan's record was not enough to indicate ""he is not competent to graduate"" or that further academic probation would be helpful. ""He would be able to contain his behavior enough to complete any period of probation successfully,"" the memo said.","Memo written by Maj. Nidal Hasan's supervisor at Walter Reed .

"(CNN) -- The Netherlands is liable for the deaths of more than 300 men who were taken from a Dutch compound in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in July 1995, during the Bosnian war, a Dutch court ruled Wednesday. The Dutch peacekeepers failed to protect the men -- most of whom were killed after they were taken away by Bosnian Serb forces -- and the state should compensate the families of the men for their loss, the District Court in The Hague said. The civil case against the Dutch state was brought by the Mothers of Srebrenica group in connection with the massacre of nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica, one of the worst atrocities of the Balkans conflict. The Bosnian Muslims had sought refuge in the compound of the Dutch peacekeeping force, known as Dutchbat, when the Bosnian Serb forces overran the town. But the peacekeepers, who were under the command of a U.N. Protection Force deployed after the collapse of the former Yugoslavia, allowed them to be taken away by the Bosnian Serbs. Netherlands liable for deaths of 3 Muslim men in Bosnia . ""Given the information Dutchbat had about the fate of the male refugees at the time and because of the special position of the compound -- a fenced-in area where they had full control -- they should not have participated in the deportation of the more than 300 men,"" a court news release on the ruling said. ""The Court considers that at the end of the afternoon of 13 July 1995, Dutchbat should have taken into account the possibility that these men would be the victim of genocide and that it can be said with sufficient certainty that, had Dutchbat allowed them to stay at the compound, these men would have remained alive. By cooperating in the deportation of these men, Dutchbat acted unlawfully."" The court ruled that the Dutch state should compensate the wives and children of the adult men who were killed and the parents of the boys who died. However, the Dutch state was not found liable on all the counts put forward by the Mothers of Srebrenica. It cannot be held liable for the deaths of thousands more men who were killed after they fled to woods near the Dutchbat compound, the court said. The state also was not found liable for the actions of the Dutchbat peacekeepers before the fall of Srebrenica, nor for the failure of air support to materialize and the force's failure to recapture the Muslim enclave from the Bosnian Serb forces. The United Nations had designated Srebrenica a ""safe area"" for Bosnian Muslims, known as Bosniaks, as the Bosnian Serb forces carried out a campaign of ethnic cleansing. The massacre there, which the U.N. peacekeepers failed to prevent, was the worst in Europe since the end of World War II. Last September, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands ruled in a separate case that the Dutch state was liable for the deaths of three Bosnian Muslims who were sent away from the Dutchbat compound outside Srebrenica and subsequently killed by the Bosnian Serb army and allied paramilitary groups. Meanwhile, the trial of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and former Bosnian Serb army chief Ratko Mladic continues at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague. Both men are accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.

"(CNN) -- In kindergarten, Owen Kellogg came home sobbing one day because another boy at school had told him that he had a peanut, and that he was going to force Owen to eat it. Owen, now 7, is allergic to peanuts and tree nuts, said his mother, Haylee Kellogg of Cedar Hills, Utah. In reality, the taunting boy did not have a peanut, but Owen didn't know that -- he just knew that eating a peanut could make him stop breathing. It's hard for parents of food-allergic children to keep them safe at school when there are so many opportunities to eat snacks and meals with unsafe ingredients. For some kids, just touching a certain food or inhaling particles of it could cause a reaction. But on top of the safety question is a social one. A study released last week suggests that almost half of children who have food allergies have been bullied -- sometimes by having food thrown at them. ""Clearly, it's an issue for these school-aged children in terms of how they interact with their peers,"" said Dr. Clifford Bassett, director of Allergy & Asthma Care of New York. ""Immediately, when there's a diagnosis of food allergy, there's a little bit of a stigma."" The new study furthers the mounting evidence that many kids with food allergies may endure social ostracism while also trying to eat safely. A 2010 study in the journal Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology said that 35% of kids over age 5 with food allergies have endured bullying, teasing or harassment. Parents of children with food allergies reported in the study that these incidents -- both physical and verbal -- happened because of food allergies. Food allergy is a growing problem in young people. As many as 8% of children in the United States have at least one food allergy, according to research data. There is no cure for food allergies. The only way to stop a life-threatening reaction, called anaphylaxis, is an epinephrine auto-injector, which allergists recommend that everyone with severe food allergies should carry. Allergists offer skin or blood tests to see what specific foods may cause reactions, but they cannot know how severe those reactions will be -- some people may have only mild symptoms, while others may stop breathing. How to ensure no schoolchild dies of an allergy attack . Negotiating school safety . Owen's family moved nearly 30 miles from Spanish Fork, Utah, to Lehi, Utah, when Owen was in kindergarten, so that they could live in a school district with some peanut-free accommodations. Peanut products aren't sold at lunch at Owen's school, said Kellogg. When Kellogg learned about the peanut taunting incident, she went to see the school principal. The result was that the other boy, who had also been bullying other kids, was moved to a different classroom. At the bus stop, Kellogg met the woman partly responsible for food allergy awareness at Owen's school: Jessica Norton, whose 11-year-old daughter Grace is allergic to peanuts, soy and various kinds of beans. Grace is the only one of three siblings who has food allergies; so is Owen. When Grace was in first grade, she had to eat her lunch in the principal's office on days that the school served peanut butter, to avoid a reaction from coming into contact with it. This solution was not optimal, in Norton's view. She petitioned the school district to stop serving peanut products, and was successful. Like Owen, Grace also experienced bullying because of her allergy. A boy would often chase Grace around with peanut butter in hand -- once, he touched her face with it, making her break out in hives. She only told her parents a couple of months after it stopped happening. These days, she doesn't get picked on that way, Norton said. ""I think she can, kind of, stand up for herself now, and will stand up for herself now,"" Norton said. Standing up to other adults . Norton was surprised by the negative reactions reflected in the CNN.com reader comments about provisions for allergic kids in schools. In a story about the recent bullying study, user ""Brad Heddan"" wrote, in response to one reader, ""how about you keep your sickly kid home? That is what homeschooling is for. (...) we don't have to accommodate your sick kid."" And ""lorie"" wrote, ""Many allergies can be life threatening. It is completely unfair and ridiculous to expect 400 other families to change their eating habits because you can't teach your kid not to touch someone else's food."" These sentiments were also seen on the comment board on a 2010 story about food allergy bullying. At that time, Norton chimed in explaining Grace's school's situation and adding, ""My only thought is this, teaching children compassion for others is a good thing. And frankly, it seems a lot of adults that have made comments on here could use a little compassion too.' Norton has not felt that level of backlash from her efforts to keep Grace safe in her own community. A few parents have made remarks of the ""Why do we have to accommodate your daughter?"" variety, but generally everyone has been kind and supportive. ""We're talking about life and death here,"" says Norton. ""If it were their child's life, they would do everything they could to make sure their child's life is protected."" Making people understand . Communication with teachers, administrators, coaches, and the school nurse is key to ensuring that a food-allergic child does well, in terms of staying safe from allergens and psychologically speaking, Bassett said. It's also important to talk to a child about bullying, which can have serious psychological consequences, such as anxiety, Bassett said. It's harder to get teenagers to not take risks when it comes to avoiding problem foods and always carrying the epinephrine auto-injector, Bassett said. ""Unfortunately the adolescent and child psyche is very sensitive to what people think and say and do,"" he said. Kellogg is proactive about getting Owen's peers to understand his situation. Every school year, on the first day, Kellogg takes a book called ""Allie the Allergic Elephant: A Children's Story of Peanut Allergies."" The teacher reads this book to the children in the class so that they better understand what it means to have food allergies. She also brings allergy-safe treats to keep in the classroom so that Owen can have them if someone brings in unsafe sweets to celebrate a birthday. He carries an epinephrine auto-injector with him. ""School is the scariest thing for me because a lot of people just don't understand how serious it could be,"" Kellogg said. Norton also has a routine for the beginning of Grace's school year: Talking to the teacher about foods and determining where the epinephrine auto-injector should be kept. The classroom policy is that if kids ate peanuts for lunch, they are supposed to wash their hands. She and her husband John told their son Jack, who is Owen's age, to keep an eye out for Owen when they were attending the same school -- to tell a teacher if he were being teased. Jack and Owen are still friends. ""I just didn't want anyone picking on him and if you have friend who will stand up for you, it makes a big difference,"" Norton said. Food allergy treatment shows promise . A table of their own? When it comes to what the best course of action is in terms of protection from allergens, the plan should be individualized, Bassett said. You want to shield children from harm, but you also want to let kids be kids, he said. The Kelloggs moved to Cedar Hills in May. At Owen's new school, there is a special table where children with common allergies can -- in theory -- sit together for lunch, isolated from kids who bring food that would be unsafe for the allergic group. Owen sat at the table for the first couple of days of school this year, alone. Back that the regular lunch table, Owen takes several precautions. He owns his own lunch box and doesn't put food on the table. He has antibacterial napkins so he can wipe contaminants off the area where he sits. And he knows what peanut butter looks like and smells like, so he can avoid it. However, Kellogg said she believes Owen's school can do more to raise awareness and practice caution regarding food allergies. ""I'm going to have to be the Jessica Norton in this school, and go in and make it known that they have to do a little bit more to protect these kids,"" Kellogg said.

"(CNN) -- It is when talking about her own children or grandchildren that Dottie Sandusky chokes up with emotion, when the pain of her husband's conviction for sexually abusing young boys rises to the surface. ""We kept it from the kids as long as we could because we did not know what was going to happen,"" said Dottie Sandusky, fighting back tears in an interview with CNN's Jason Carroll. ""And that was really hard. We had to tell the kids, and the kids questioned their dad. And the kids talked to him and he told them and they believe their dad."" To Dottie Sandusky, the boys her husband Jerry was convicted of sexually molesting were manipulated. She blames a vast conspiracy, which included the media, for the conviction that sent the 70-year-old former Penn State assistant football coach to prison on a 30- to 60-year sentence. Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted in 2012 on 45 counts, has maintained his innocence. He is appealing. The toll on the children in Sandusky clan, however, seems to preoccupy his wife the most. ""It's been tough on our family,"" she said. ""Two of our kids have lost their jobs during this time ... Our granddkids, some of them are older, old enough to understand what has gone on, and they know who their pop is, what people are saying that he is. But they know who he is. It's been really hard on them."" The Pennsylvania trial featured the testimony of eight young men who said they were sexually abused by Sandusky -- either groped in a car, soaped by him in the shower or sexually assaulted on a basement waterbed. ""It wasn't like he just took boys and took them to the shower,"" Dottie Sandusky said. ""It was when he would work them out, and they would shower and it's a public place. I mean, there's people that come and go in the locker room all the time."" Asked whether she was deluding herself or unwilling to accept the truth, she said: ""I'm not that kind of a person and I believe he's innocent, and if I didn't believe he was innocent, I would not stand by him."" Sandusky 'was found guilty before trial,' Dottie Sandusky says . The scandal gripped the nation and ended a torturous chapter for the victims and Penn State's vaunted football program -- including the dismissal of the late legendary coach Joe Paterno and one of America's highest-paid university presidents, Graham Spanier. It also tarnished Penn State's celebrated reputation in collegiate athletics and erased part of the Nittany Lions' impressive record under Paterno from the annals of football history. John Ziegler, a Sandusky family confidant and documentary filmmaker, believes Penn State administrators railroaded Paterno by firing him in the wake of the scandal and making it virtually impossible for Sandusky to have a fair trial. ""When Joe Paterno was fired, it is a nuclear explosion that goes through the landscape of this case,"" Ziegler told CNN. ""And because of that, Jerry Sandusky loses all presumption of innocence."" At the trial of her husband of 37 years, Dottie Sandusky testified that she never heard or saw anything strange or sexual in the basement of their home, where many of the victims say her husband molested them. The couple's adopted son, Matt Sandusky, originally denied to a grand jury being abused, but later told his attorney that he, too, was a victim. In the police interview, Matt Sandusky said that he was molested between the ages of 8 and 15, that he tried to escape from the home and once attempted suicide. Matt Sandusky, who was 18 when he was adopted, had earlier spent time with them in foster care. ""I don't know whether somebody talked to him, or whether he saw money,"" Dottie Sandusky said of their adopted son's change of story. Asked whether she wanted to reconcile with her adopted son, Dottie Sandusky -- again referring to the family children -- said amid tears: ""I would like to talk to Matt. I really miss seeing his kids. They were a part of our lives. And, the hurt that they must be going through. I would love to talk to Matt just to see why and what. What his thoughts are."" She previously disputed his credibility, referring to Matt's ""many run-ins with the law"" in a letter to the judge who was about to sentence her husband in October 2012. ""Matt is extremely disappointed that Dottie and the Sanduskys have decided to smear his character in an attempt to deflect attention from Jerry Sandusky's heinous crimes,"" his lawyers, Justine Andronici and Andrew Shubin, said in a statement to CNN at the time. ""Matt has shown tremendous courage and strength. Rather than supporting her son when he made the gut-wrenching decision to come forward and tell the truth about the abuse he suffered at the hands of Jerry Sandusky, Dottie Sandusky has chosen to continue Jerry's strategy of blaming and attacking the victims, thereby perpetuating the abuse."" Lawyers for two victims recently responded to Dottie Sandusky's latest comments. ""Mrs. Sandusky is our best recent example of our deep denial of the reality of child sex abuse,"" attorney Marci Hamilton said.Â ""Never underestimate the ability of a pedophile to charm and deceive the adults around him or her."" Attorney Tom Kline said, ""Dott(ie) Sandusky, like her husband, remains remarkably unremorseful towards Jerry Sandusky's victims. One significant and noticeable difference is her dramatic shift from her cold and detached demeanor as a witness for her husband at his criminal trial to an emotional and distraught spouse, which appears to my eye to be an attempt to convey a sympathetic image for herself and husband -- a child molester convicted by overwhelming evidence."" Since the trial, 26 men have settled claims with Penn State totaling $59.7 million in connection with the Sandusky scandal, the university announced last fall. A few other claims have not yet been settled. ""I think that they could be manipulated by people,"" Dottie Sandusky said. ""I think a lot of them had financial problems. I just don't believe their stories. I'm sorry."" At least every week, she visits her husband in his southwestern Pennsylvania prison. ""He's in his cell 23 hours a day, Monday through Friday,"" Dottie Sandusky told CNN. ""And then on weekends its 24 hours. It's hard. We talk about what he's doing in prison, what has happened. And I try to cheer him up, but he ends up cheering me up instead of me cheering him up."" During the interview, Dottie Sandusky showed CNN's Carroll the basement room of the State College, Pennsylvania, home where some of the victims said they were abused. One accuser said his muffled screams went unheard by her upstairs. ""I would have heard it, yes,"" she said of his screams for help. Dottie Sandusky was read part of letter her husband wrote to CNN. It said, ""My biggest hope at the moment is that somehow people will realize how unfair everything was and that judges will have the courage to examine everything."" She said: ""I believe God has a purpose and some purpose will come out of this, that he will see us through."" Penn State's record number of sex offense reports spurs federal inquiry .

"(CNN) -- In the spring of 2005, Arlene Castro appeared on an ""America's Most Wanted"" segment pleading for help in finding her best friend, Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus, who'd mysteriously gone missing along a busy Cleveland avenue one year earlier. Little did she know. At that time, DeJesus was alive but captive in an older man's house about three miles away, authorities said. There, she was chained, threatened and sexually assaulted repeatedly. The man who police say was responsible for the girl's hell? Arlene Castro's own father, Ariel. Speaking Thursday on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" Arlene Castro said she had ""no idea"" her father allegedly was holding DeJesus and two other young women, Michelle Knight and Amanda Berry, as well as Berry's 6-year-old daughter, who was born in captivity. Arlene and her father -- with whom she was not living when her friend went missing, instead being with her mother -- ""were never really that close,"" she said. The last time the father and daughter talked was late last month, and their conversations were typically short and confined to niceties. ""'Let me know if you need anything,' and that was it, every time,"" Arlene Castro recalled. Now, she would like to talk with her longtime friend, DeJesus, to introduce her to her kids and tell her much, much more. ""I would like to say that I'm absolutely so, so sorry,"" a tearful Arlene Castro told ABC. ""... I'm so sorry for everything."" According to the FBI, the then 14-year-old DeJesus disappeared on April 2, 2004, as she was walking home from middle school. She was last seen at a pay telephone booth between 2:45 p.m. and 3 p.m. along Cleveland's Lorain Avenue. And with her at that telephone booth was Arlene Castro. Castro told ""America's Most Wanted"" -- as seen in archived video posted online, including on Slate's website -- that her friend loaned her 50 cents, so she could use the phone and ask her mother if the two could spend the afternoon together at DeJesus' house. Daughter: 'He is dead to me' ""I told her I couldn't and she said, 'Well OK, I'll talk to you later.' And she walked,"" the then-teenage Castro said, with the ""America's Most Wanted"" reporter explaining that DeJesus would have taken the bus but had loaned out the change she'd normally use for bus fare. Authorities have begun spelling out what they say happened to DeJesus next. Ariel Castro, Arlene's father, lured the girl into a vehicle, then took her to his home and forced her to stay, according to charging documents. She was not alone. Two other captive women were already inside the 1,400-square foot house -- Amanda Berry, who ""America's Most Wanted"" mentioned in its report had gone missing one year earlier, and Michelle Knight, who had last been seen in August 2002. Today, all three women are free, including DeJesus who is now 23-years-old. Ariel Castro, meanwhile, is being held on $8 million bond after being charged with kidnapping and rape. As for his daughter Arlene, she's crushed. ""I'm really disappointed, embarrassed, mainly devastated,"" she said.","Arlene Castro said she was with Gina DeJesus just before she went missing in 2004 .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy has a smile on his face again, and it is all to do with a new love in his life -- golf. After reams of column inches devoted to his split with fiancÃ©e Caroline Wozniacki, the two-time major champion has decided to go back to basics in order to fill the void. As he heads for the third major of the year -- The British Open in Liverpool that begins Thursday -- he's been busy stalking the links courses of his native Northern Ireland and rekindling his passion for the game. ""I've sort of fallen in love with golf again,"" the current world No. 8 told CNN's Living Golf show. ""I'm a golfer first and foremost and the last month or so I've really buried my head in my golf game. ""Golf is my first passion and my first love and it's great to be able to spend days playing and remember where you started again, remembering those rounds at Holywood Golf Club,"" he added referring to his local club in Northern Ireland. ""Just remembering the love and the joy you have for the game. I feel like I've found that out these last few weeks."" The 25-year-old's decision to call off his planned wedding to Danish tennis star Wozniacki predictably sparked a maelstrom in the press. Two high profile sporting stars, known the world over, ending their engagement just days after wedding invitations had been issued became headline news. A bereft looking McIlroy fronted up at Wentworth ahead of the BMW PGA Championship in May merely hours after the news broke, and promptly won the European Tour's flagship event. That triumph represented his first big win on European soil, his other victories on the Tour coming either in the Middle East or Asia. The 2011 U.S. Open and 2012 U.S. PGA champion spoke of the ""sanctuary"" the course offered away from all the questions about his state of mind and emotional well-being. And a large chunk of his time since has been spent honing his game on the links courses of his homeland in preparation for his assault on another prestigious crown -- The British Open. Despite being brought up on courses similar to the one he'll try to tame at Royal Liverpool in the 143rd incarnation of golf's oldest major, McIlroy has struggled to make an impression since 2010. But that is something he is determined to change this time around. ""I feel like my record in the British Open hasn't been great,"" he explained. ""It's important to prepare to play links golf, to know the course as much as you can. ""I finished third at St Andrew's in 2010 but apart from that I haven't done much. I want to really put all I can into it and try and compete this year. ""I don't want to curse my luck but it was incredibly windy on the Friday afternoon (at St Andrew's, where McIlroy followed up his opening round of 63 with a second round 80). ""It was my first time leading a major after the first round and I didn't really handle it that well but I came back well and at the weekend I shot a couple of rounds in the 60s. As well as Holywood Golf Club, McIlroy has spent time honing his game at Royal County Down and Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland. ""I've been getting as much practice around the greens because that's where you have a lot of variety and play shots you normally don't play on tour,"" he said. ""Ireland and Northern Ireland have some of the best links courses in the world so to not take advantage of that would be a shame."" After that third place finish in 2010, McIlroy's form at The British Open has lurched ever further backwards. He finished 25th at Royal St George's in 2011, as compatriot Darren Clarke lifted the Claret Jug, then 60th at Royal Lytham the following year. Last time out, at Muirfield in Scotland, McIlroy endured a miserable start, shooting 79 on the opening day and describing himself as ""brain dead"" in a typically frank press conference immediately after. It was one of the low points in a slump that saw him relinquish the world No. 1 ranking and fend off persistent questions as to whether his equipment deal with Nike had disrupted his game. And though he missed the cut after a round of 75 on the second day, he took some valuable lessons from his playing partner on the opening two days, and eventual winner, Phil Mickelson. ""I played with Phil Mickelson for two rounds at Muirfield last year and I was really impressed with the way he controlled his ball flight,"" McIlroy said. ""He was bouncing balls into the green, getting the ball on the ground as soon as possible and I feel that's something I need to do more of. ""Back when I was an amateur I was used to playing links golf much more so you are much more comfortable playing those shots. ""Now as a pro most weeks you're playing everything through the air and trying to adapt your game for these two weeks a year. ""That's why I'm going to try and practice those shots so when the time comes I'm comfortable with them."" McIlroy does have some memories of the course at Hoylake, having played there as a teenager, but they can't be classed as fond ones. ""I actually played at Hoylake in 2003 in the British boys as a 14-year-old and got beaten in the first round,"" he said. ""That was the first and last time I have played the course. It's quite a flat golf course. I like the bunkering -- the faces look at you off the tee so you have a good visualization and good definition of where you need to hit the ball round there. ""I remember watching The Open in 2006 and how hot and burnt it was, Tiger (Woods) taking an iron off every tee and going on to win. ""I'm looking forward to seeing it again. I think it's a course from what I remember should set up pretty well for me depending on the conditions."" As he rekindles his love for golf, another important relationship in McIlroy's personal life has also deepened. He and Jack Nicklaus -- the greatest golfer of all time with 18 majors to his name -- are neighbors in Florida, and McIlroy is a member at the 74-year-old's Bear's Club. And that means McIlroy has the ear of one of the most important opinions in the game. ""Jack has always been so generous with his time, we've formed quite a nice friendship over the last few years,"" he explained. ""Being a member of his club in Palm Beach we've talked a lot. Most of the time it's about golf and how to handle certain situations. The (most recent) meeting was how he manages his time. ""All the things he had to manage on the course and still dedicate himself to his game. Finding a balance in life in a way. ""It's always nice to spend some time with him, if nothing else it inspires you to go out and be better, practice and be a better player. ""I think he gets me and I do too. A lot of the things he says really make sense.""","Rory McIlroy says he has fallen in love with golf again in recent months .
