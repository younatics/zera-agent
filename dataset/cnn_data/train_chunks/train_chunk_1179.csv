"A teenager who became the youngest mother in Britain to a Down’s Syndrome baby after falling pregnant aged 15 has spoken of her pride in proving her doubters wrong. Despite being just a child herself, single teen mother Catherine Moore, now 19, refused to give her baby up after learning he had Down’s Syndrome, vowing to raise him herself despite concerns that she wouldn’t cope. Recent figures show up to 90 per cent of Down's babies are aborted - a figure which Catherine finds distressing. Catherine Moore, who fell pregnant at the age of 15 and then went on to have her son Tyler who had Down's Syndrome, loves every second of being his mother . Now as her son starts pre-school aged three she wants to pay tribute to the little boy that, far from ruining her life, she says may even have saved it. Catherine, from Maghera, Northern Ireland, said: ‘Everyone said I wouldn’t be able to cope and my life was over if I kept Tyler. ‘But they were wrong, having Tyler was the best thing that ever happened to me. He changed my life for the better and I am so grateful to have him. 'I was going off the rails but he saved me. We are a team and I am so very proud of him. ‘When he came along I was just a child myself and suddenly I had a child of my own with special needs. But I never once thought of giving him up. 'He needed me and I needed him, it was as simple as that. I could never be without him and he is quite simply the most wonderful thing ever to happen to me, he really is. ‘I hate it when people say they are sorry he has Down’s because I am not. It’s who Tyler is and I would not change him for the world. I’m so glad I had a Down’s baby.' Catherine's mother Georgina said her heart sank when she heard the news but is very impressed by how mature her daughter has been . Catherine wasn't initially told about Tyler's condition and when her mother broke the news to her, she vowed to love him even more . Catherine was weeks away from her GCSE exams when aged 15 she learned she was pregnant after splitting up with her boyfriend. She said: ‘When my period was late I went straight to my mum and told her.' Mother Georgina McClure, 39, said: ‘When Catherine told me her period was late my heart sank. I bought her a test and watched the line turn blue. We both started crying. ‘I took her to see a doctor who talked through the options. But Catherine refused a termination. She wanted her baby and as a mother I agreed to stand by her even though I was worried for her future.' Because she was so young Catherine had monthly scans. Speaking about her pregnancy, she said: 'Mum  came with me and we both cried seeing this little bean on the screen. I couldn’t believe I really had a baby inside me. Suddenly it felt so real.’ Catherine was just 15 when she fell pregnant but has handled the situation with great maturity and loves being a mother . Catherine spent her 16th birthday shopping for a cot and at her 28 week scan found out she was having a boy. Georgina said: ‘She was so focused on being a good mum. I was impressed with her attitude. She was reading about birth and parenthood all the time on the internet and I wondered if maybe with my help she would be able to finish her studies.' But there was another surprise in store for the family. The morning after her daughter had given birth at 36 weeks to a seemingly perfect baby, Georgina received a call from the hospital. ‘It was a midwife and she just said she was sorry but she had some bad news. Tests had shown my grandson Tyler had Down's Syndrome. Family: Catherine says she worried she would never find love but fiance Nathan 'adores Tyler' Catherine's mother Georgina has supported her daughter and Tyler and they are like a team . ‘I was shocked and utterly devastated for Catherine. Because she was so young they hadn’t told her in case she didn’t understand. They wanted me to come back and do it. ‘I remember thinking to myself ""if she’s too young even to know what it is how on earth is she going to cope?"" 'It didn't seem possible. I always thought it was older mothers at risk of having Down's babies and Catherine was young. I wondered if there had been a mix up,' she said. But when Georgina told her daughter the news, she reacted surprisingly well. Shrugging, she said: ‘Is that all?’ Then she scooped him up out of the crib and cuddled him. ‘Tears rolled down my face. I was proud of how strong her mothering instinct was already yet frightened for what the future held for them both,' said Georgina. Catherine was just a child herself when she fell pregnant and the tender age of fifteen . Catherine added: ‘I was panicking that she was going to say he was seriously ill. I was terrified so when mum said he had Down’s I actually felt relieved. ‘I’d watched the EastEnders storyline with Billy and Honey’s baby so I knew what it was and I wasn’t upset at all. I just knew then he needed me more than ever and whatever I needed to do for my son I would do it. Scans showed Tyler also had two heart murmers and a problem with his left heart valve. They warned he might need surgery and constant checks and care but Catherine remained unfazed. In fact everything they threw at her she vowed to do her best. She learned Tyler would have delayed walking and speech as well as impaired vision and hearing. Catherine said: ‘It was daunting, yes, but I knew that somehow we would manage. We had to manage, he was my baby and I was his mother and I knew it was my job to manage whatever life threw at the two of us. ‘It never crossed my mind for a second to walk away from Tyler. I had loved him before he was born and I loved him even more in my arms.' Catherine is now engaged to partner Nathan Woods, 22. ‘When I told him I was a teenage single mum with a Down's Syndrome baby I thought he would run a mile but he didn’t,’ she smiles. The couple are planning to wed next year with Tyler as page boy. Catherine said: 'I never thought I would be lucky enough to find love. We are quite a package but Nathan isn’t fazed at all. He adores Tyler.' Catherine is now nineteen and says that walking away from Tyler was a thought that never crossed her mind . The couple are planning to wed next year with Tyler as page boy . With Catherine’s help Tyler has met all his milestones for children with Down's. He was crawling at one and started to learn sign language to communicate. ‘I wanted to be a vet and maybe one day I will go back and sit my exams but for the moment being Tyler’s mummy is rewarding enough. ‘Nobody could have prepared me for the challenges of raising a baby with Down's, but then they couldn’t have explained the joy either. ‘Having him wasn’t the end of my life it was just the start. ‘It breaks my heart reading about women aborting Down’s babies. They are a real joy and if I can make a success of it, anyone can.’","Catherine Moore discovered her son Tyler had Down's Syndrome the day after he was born .

"In these parts, a pay phone is a visitor's best option for reaching the rest of the world. A cell phone signal is an hour away by car. Wi-Fi is forbidden. The radio plays nothing but static. And other than the occasional passing pickup truck whose driver offers a wave, it's dead silent in Green Bank, West Virginia. Seemingly off the beaten path, this community of fewer than two hundred residents is the heart of the National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ), a 13,000-square-mile area where state and federal laws discourage the use of everyday devices that emit electromagnetic waves. All quiet on the home front: Michael Holstine, business manager at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, walks out of a shed underneath the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in Green Bank, West Virginia . The telescope towers over farmland as dusk falls in Green Bank. Officials at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory chose the site for its remote location and mountainous surroundings, which help to keep distant radio waves outside of the quiet zone . Sunlight streams through trees as a car winds down a mountain road in Highland County, Virginia, inside the 13,000 square-mile quiet zone . The quiet zone aims to protect sensitive radio telescopes at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, as well as a nearby Naval research facility, from man-made interference. This silence enables the observatory to detect energy in outer space that is equivalent to the energy emitted by a single snowflake hitting the ground. While scientists listen intently for clues from the universe on its structure and origins, residents in some of the timeworn railroad towns in this valley maintain a fundamentally tech-less lifestyle that for most Americans is a memory. More than 90 per cent of American adults have a cell phone today, yet some locals fondly recall ditching their wireless device after moving here. After all, it's useless, and that's fine by them. Betty Mullenax walks behind a checkout stand at Trent's General Store in Arbovale. 'We've never known any other way,' she said of life without cell phones .

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory settled on Pocahontas County and its early-20th century railroad towns in part because there was no industry in the area that posed the threat of creating radio frequency interference . The quiet zone, marked out on this map inside the square, aims to protect sensitive radio telescopes at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in West Virginia . The NRQZ was set up by . the Federal . Communications Commission in 1958. The zone does not ban all radio transmissions - for example police, ambulance and fire department radios are used there. Exceptions to the rule are allowed for remote alarm systems and extreme weather warnings. The only broadcast radio stations in the heart of the Quiet Zone are part of the Allegheny Mountain Radio network with just one station in the AM band, and several low-power FM stations. The area has been popular with people who believe that they are suffering from electromagnetic hypersensitivity - a term for those who believe they are being exposed to radio waves from electronic devices which leave them with health problems. A phone booth stands on the side of a road in Head Waters, inside the National Radio Quiet Zone. While pay phones have all but disappeared in the United States, they still can be found in this part of the country, where a cell phone signal is hard to come by .

"How soon is too soon? And do you really love someone after three months (Cheryl Cole)? They're the three most significant words in the English language. Deliver them at the right time to the right person and the first time they're said out loud calls for champagne. Blurt them out at the wrong time to the wrong person and you need a stiff drink for totally different reasons. It's the ultimate embarrassment. Scroll down for video . Tracey says that it isn't really possible to fall in love after three months as you are not yet aware of any of their flaws . Most of us have a justifiable phobia about being the first to say the 'L' word. Why? Because we don't know what the hell we'd do if our partner doesn't say it back. There is only one correct response to 'I love you' and that's 'I love you too.' So, what if they say, 'That's nice. Anyway, as I was saying . . .'? Or look at you with pity and say, 'Listen, you're awfully sweet but . . .'? Timing is everything. Say 'I love you' too soon and you not only look desperate, you instantly lose power and dignity. Leave it too late and you risk missing that magic moment which could launch you both onto the next relationship stage. So how do you judge when it's appropriate to let the cat out of the bag and someone into your heart? Tracey says you should wait until you're bursting to tell someone you love them . Only you can truly answer that one, but these are some things you might like to think about: . Make sure you both speak the same language . Your 'I love you,' might mean, 'I think this is special, let's give it a go.' His interpretation might be, 'When's the wedding?' If you think your partner will overreact, tack something on the end like, 'Don't panic – I'm not about to propose. I'm just telling you how I feel.' Wait until you're absolutely bursting . Like, you'll internally combust if you don't say it right now. You're 100 per cent convinced you mean it. You don't love someone after three dates . When I was 12, a kid at my school came up to me and delivered a message. 'See that guy over there?' he said, pointing to a kid from my English class. 'Well, that's Brad and he sent me over here to tell you he loves you and wants to go steady.' 'Okay,' I said. Brad and I went steady for a whole week. We didn't speak once though we did sit together outside E-block for a full five minutes and looked at our feet. True love? At 12, yes. But if you're over 18, I think not. Telling someone you love them on the second date or second week is ridiculous. It's daft – and that's what they'll think you are if you do it. To avoid a false reply, Tracey says you should never say 'I love you' before or after sex . You don't really love someone after three months . The fact is, the first time anyone says, 'I love you,' they usually don't.Not really. True love takes years to develop (take note, Cheryl Cole) and if you're lucky, it's always growing. You look back and think, I really thought I loved them when I said it back then but it's nothing compared to how I feel now. That's not to say you can't feel 'in love' after three months of heavy dating, and it probably is acceptable to trot it out then. But for absolute maximum impact, I'd wait six. I know - hard core - but if someone says, 'I love you,' after you've dated for six months, they've thought long and hard about it. Saying, 'I love you,' when you're in the infatuated part of the relationship is easy: you aren't aware of any faults. Saying it when you've got a pretty good idea of what you're letting yourself in for is far more of a compliment. An ex of mine told me he loved me for the first time when I stumbled back to bed after throwing up for the sixti­eth time that night because of food poisoning. Call me strange but I was far more complimented than if he'd said it across the candlelit dinner table earlier that evening, when both of us were tarted up and looking fabulous, totally unaware I was about to swallow a dodgy oyster. Sneaky ways to say it . The coward's way of saying it first is to say, 'I think I'm falling in love with you.' If they look at you in horror, you can always say, 'Don't panic, I know it's just casual with us. I was only kidding . . .' or, 'That's why I've decided to break it off – you don't feel the same way.' Another less traumatic option is to pop it at the very, very end of a conversation when you can disappear immediately after saying it. Like just before you walk through the doors to catch a plane or at the end of a phone call. Dropping the 'I' off it also makes it less heavy. 'Love you' is what you say to your mum. Again, if they look uncomfortable, you can always add, 'As a friend, of course.' If you're unsure of whether it's reciprocated, try putting something after it. 'I love it when you do that', 'I love it when we spend time together.' 'Saying, I love you, when you're in the infatuated part of the relationship is easy: you aren't aware of any faults' If they look wide-eyed and gaze at you hopefully, it's safe to say the big three words solo. Don't ask them . Never ever follow up, 'I love you,' with, 'Do you love me?' If they do, they'll tell you immediately. If they don't, they're forced to say something like, 'Gee. Uhhh. I guess so.' Dignity demolished. Don't do it with sex . Don't say it just before (especially before) or after sex – you won't be able to trust their reply. Some people will say anything to get laid, and if it's afterward, feel forced to say, 'I do too,' because they've just had sex with you, for God's sake. Few of us are courageous enough to ravage someone then say, 'Actually, it was just the sex I wanted.' Even if it was, they'll mumble something appropriate just to be polite.

"France manager Didier Deschamps has launched an attack on Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri's character insisting he lacks 'sincerity'. The former Arsenal player has not featured for France since November 2013 and has endured frosty relations with the national side since he was handed a three-match ban for his behaviour during Euro 2012. Nasri was then left furious after he was omitted from France's World Cup squad last year despite playing a key role in City's title-winning campaign. Samir Nasri trains with Manchester City ahead of the Champions League clash with Barcelona . Former Arsenal midfielder Nasri faced the media on Monday ahead of the fixture . Nasri has not played for France since a World Cup qualifier in November 2013 . The 27-year-old retired from international football following the tournament in Brazil and criticised Deschamps again in an interview with L'Equipe earlier this month, referring to the former midfielder as a 'joker' and a 'hypocrite'. And now the 46-year-old has hit back by claiming Nasri refused to talk with him and insists France are doing just fine without him. 'People need to know that, in the autumn of 2012, I decided to call him to discuss stuff with him,' he told RMC Sport. 'He refused to listen. He did not want to discuss anything. France manager Didier Deschamps described Nasri as insincere and said midfielder refused to talk to him . Nasri (centre) retired from international duty last August after being left out of France's World Cup squad . 'I was waiting for him to want to talk, but he did not meet my expectations in sport.

"The global super-rich are using loopholes to hide up to £20trillion from the taxman, a report said yesterday. The figure is more than the combined gross domestic product of the US and Japan and is a threat to the very essence of democracy, said campaigners. The report, The Price of Offshore Revisited, shows how money is being siphoned into offshore banks instead of being invested at home. The report says secretive jurisdictions including Hong Kong are receiving huge influxes of funds from a global super elite . Its author, James Henry, a former . chief economist at consultancy McKinsey, used data from the World Bank, . International Monetary Fund, United Nations and central banks. His report gave a total of at least . £13trillion, but said assets he had not been able to identify could make . it as high as £20trillion. Mr Henry said the assets of ‘high-net-worth . individuals’ are being protected by ‘professional enablers’ taking . advantage of gaps in cross-border tax rules. According to his calculations, £6.3trillion of assets are owned by 92,000 people – or 0.001 per cent of the world’s population. John Christensen, of the international . campaign group Tax Justice Network, which commissioned the research, . said: ‘What the [£13trillion] figure doesn’t include is the . non-financial assets, the yachts, the jets, the works of art, the real . estate.’ The Cayman Islands ranked highly in a list of nations where a large quantity of the huge sums are heading annually . Mr Christensen added: ‘I would say . this is a defining moment for democracy, because unless people feel . governments are treating taxpayers fairly our faith in democracy . disappears. I know that people feel angry.’ A previous Financial Secrecy Index . compiled by the Tax Justice Network ranks the jurisdictions enjoying an . influx of capital in a Financial Secrecy Index. The top 10 private banks in the world including UBS were estimated to be managing around £4trillion in funds in 2010 . In the table for 2011, it suggests . that Switzerland, the Cayman Islands, Luxembourg and Hong Kong are . amongst the nations where a large amount of the huge sums are heading. And despite the popular perception of . tax havens as being small isolated islands, the campaign group says that . the biggest players in 'the supply of financial secrecy' are almost all . wealthy nations. The group also estimates that around . $250bn is lost in taxes each year by governments worldwide as a result . of the wealthiest individuals holding their assets offshore. The total value of the money being leaked from some nations even dwarfs the debts they often owe to the rest of the world. According to the Tax Justice Network, the consequences of this tax avoidance are severe. 'Secrecy distorts trade and investment . flows, and creates a criminogenic environment for a litany of evils . that hurt the citizens of rich and poor countries alike. 'It’s not just developing countries . that suffer: European countries like Greece, Italy and Portugal have . been brought to their knees by decades of secrecy and tax evasion.' Estimates suggest that if the interest . on the huge sums being lost were taxed at a rate of around 30%, around . £121bn would be generated for the treasuries around the world.","Secretive jurisdictions including Switzerland and Hong Kong have seen a huge influx of funds in recent years .

"Schools found ‘indoctrinating pupils about gay people’ will face being closed down under new rules designed to promote ‘British values’, the Government confirmed today. The Department for Education insisted it was ‘nonsense’ to suggest teachers would have to give lessons on gay rights. But a spokesman insisted Ofsted, which has introduced the new rules the wake of the Islamist Trojan Horse plot to radicalise pupils in Birmingham, was right to ensure schools were not breeding grounds for homophobia. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said any schools found 'indoctrinating' children against homosexuality faced being closed down . A spokesman said: ‘Ofsted are rightly ensuring that schools do not indoctrinate pupils about gay people - or any other people - being inferior. ‘The same goes for schools that do things like make girls sit separately at the back of the class. Both are practices which go directly against the fundamental British values of tolerance and respect. ‘We believe schools should prepare all pupils for life in modern Britain. A broad and balanced curriculum is vital for this.’ But the spokesman said it was 'nonsense' to say children would be taught gay rights. Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said Mrs Morgan 'clearly does not believe that LGBT rights are British values'. He said: ‘Compulsory sex and relationship education, including LGBT rights, in all schools is common sense, not nonsense. ‘Nicky Morgan should apologise for the offence that has been caused by claiming that it is nonsense for all schools to teach gay rights.’ It came after the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan – who said last week that she had changed her mind about gay marriage after voting against its introduction – warned schools not to ‘close minds’. She told the Sunday Times that schools must teach ‘pupils to respect other people even if they do not agree with them’. Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw will mark down any schools which do not 'actively promote' British values . Mrs Morgan said: ‘I should have thought this is a principle with which the vast majority of people would agree. All schools of whatever type have a duty to protect young people and to ensure they leave school fully prepared for life in modern Britain. ‘These values — democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs — are not new. The requirement to “actively promote” them is designed to reinforce the importance this government attaches to these values.’ Schools have been warned that those that fail to follow new rules on British values will be judged inadequate and could face closure by Ofsted inspectors. The move follows snap inspections by Ofsted at 40 schools, including those for Christian and Jewish pupils. They were launched in the wake of the Trojan Horse affair in Birmingham as part of the government’s efforts to combat extremism. Mrs Morgan is backing Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw who will say that any school suspected of not teaching a broad and balanced curriculum, of rapidly falling standards or of not preparing children for life in modern Britain will face no-notice inspections. For the first time the rules give inspectors the powers to downgrade schools where teachers are breaching the Equality Act, which encourages respect for lesbian, gay and transgender people as well as those of other religions and races.","Ofsted to check schools 'actively promote' British values to children .

"The headmistress of an all-girls private school has told her students to shun celebrities like Miley Cyrus - and idolise a former mayor instead. Charlotte Avery has been head of £30,000-a-year St Mary's School in Cambridge since 2007 and champions equality for women. She fears her pupils at the Roman Catholic school are being starved of appropriate role models with pop stars like Rihanna and Miley Cyrus, as well as models and WAGs, getting too much 'toxic' media attention. Step aside: Charlotte Avery, left, head of St Mary's School in Cambridge, says former mayor of the city Sheila Stuart is 'a better role model than Miley Cyrus', right, who presents a distorted view of body image and reality . She warns that stars are heavily airbrushed and advises girls to look closer to home, at aunts and grandmothers, for inspiration on how to carry themselves. Her latest tip is for the girls to see former Cambridge mayor Sheila Stuart as a role model instead of the controversial Wrecking Ball singer. Mrs Avery said: 'I do think we want a variety of role models out there, not simply models or pop stars or footballers' wives.

"Tony Blair today makes his most powerful political intervention since leaving Downing Street by launching an outspoken attack on ‘the problem within Islam’. The former Prime Minister addresses the shocking killing of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich by going further than he – or any front-rank British politician – has gone before over the issue of Muslim radicalism. Writing in today’s Mail on Sunday, he departs from the usual argument that Islam is a peaceful religion that should not be tainted by the actions of a few extremists. Stark view: Tony Blair says that Islamic extremism is more widespread than most politicians admit . Instead, Mr Blair urges governments to ‘be honest’ and admit that the problem is more widespread. ‘There is a problem within Islam – from the adherents of an ideology which is a strain within Islam,’ he writes. ‘We have to put it on the table and be honest about it. Of course there are Christian extremists and Jewish, Buddhist and Hindu ones. But I am afraid this strain is not the province of a few extremists. It has at its heart a view about religion and about the interaction between religion and politics that is not compatible with pluralistic, liberal, open-minded societies.’ He adds: ‘At the extreme end of the spectrum are terrorists, but the world view goes deeper and wider than it is comfortable for us to admit. So by and large we don’t admit it.’ Mr Blair’s comments are likely to be seized on by critics who will argue that by leading us into the Iraq War he has helped to swell support for radical Islam around the globe. Outspoken: The former Prime Minister addresses the shocking killing of Drummer Lee Rigby, pictured, by going further than he - or any front-rank British politician - has gone before over the issue of Muslim radicalism . The former PM’s remarks come as David Cameron prepares to make a Commons statement about the Woolwich murder tomorrow afternoon. The statement will come just hours after the first meeting of the Prime Minister’s Tackling Extremism and Radicalisation Task Force (TERFOR) – made up of senior Ministers, MI5, police and moderate religious leaders – tomorrow morning. Whitehall sources said that it would be a ‘preliminary meeting’ to draw up the agenda for a full meeting within days. The group, which the Muslim Foreign Office Minister Baroness Warsi, will examine new powers to muzzle hate preachers. Mr Cameron’s Commons speech is also expected to address the situation in Syria. In his article, Mr Blair, who is trying to establish a Palestinian state through his work as a peace envoy, also addresses the Syrian situation, warning: ‘We are at the beginning of this tragedy .  .  . Syria is in a state of accelerating disintegration. Accused: Michael Adebowale, 22, left, and Michael Adebolajo, 28, right, have both been charged with the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby, who was killed last month in Woolwich, South London . ‘President Assad is brutally . pulverising communities hostile to his regime.’ Mr Blair says that ‘the . overwhelming desire of the West is to stay out of it’, which he goes on . to describe as ‘completely understandable’. He suggests that ‘the problem within Islam’ can start to be tackled by ‘educating children about faith here and abroad’. Sir . Malcolm Rifkind, a former Foreign Secretary and chairman of the . Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee, said: ‘Much of what . Tony Blair says is sensible. ‘The . Islamic terrorists who kill people have the silent support of many more . in their community who share their ideology, if not their methods. ‘But even combined, they represent only a small minority of British Muslims, and we must never forget that. ‘However, . he appears to be still trying to justify the Iraq War rather than . acknowledging that that war provided an unprecedented opportunity for . the Sunni and Shia extremists to slaughter so many of their . co-religionists.’ Criticial: Mr Blair's comments are likely to be seized on by critics who will argue that by leading us into the Iraq War he has helped to swell support for radical Islam.

"Parents at a primary school have slammed a decision to take all fish off the menu and ban it from packed lunches - because one pupil is allergic. Robert Le Kyng Primary School in Swindon, Wiltshire, sent the letter explaining the new pupil suffers severe reactions to haddock and tuna and a blanket ban was needed to avoid any risks. The ban means fish and chips is now off the menu as well as all other dishes, such as fish finger sandwiches. Robert Le Kyng Primary School in Swindon, Wiltshire, sent the letter explaining the new pupil suffers severe reactions to haddock and tuna and a blanket ban was needed to avoid any risks . It also means that all children must refrain from having fish in their lunchboxes. Headteacher Susan Smith said the menu change was necessary to protect the unnamed girl at the school, but parents slammed the move as 'over the top'. In a letter sent to the school's 415 pupils, she said: 'This decision was not reached without seeking advice from the relevant medical professionals involved with this child. 'In this case, the child in question will be joining us full-time in September, but is coming in part-time until then as part of an extended induction. 'She has had severe reactions, not just to the smell of cooking fish, but also when her mother touched her after eating a tuna sandwich' Off the menu: Dishes like fish and chips will no longer be served and pupils cannot bring tuna sandwiches to school . She added: 'This is about the life-threatening nature of the reaction. 'The school nurse has said it is a balance between a dietary change and a life-threatening issue, and we have to protect the children under our care. 'That is why we have asked for lots more detail so we can make a more informed decision. 'We can't completely avoid the risk, and that is why we have done additional training, and we are constantly reviewing the situation. 'We appreciate this is quite a large response but at the moment it is necessary. She has had quite severe reactions, and has been in hospital as a result. 'The reactions so far have been to haddock, tuna and one other fish. It is very unusual. Annoyed: Adele Oliver, who has three children at the school, said her daughter will only eat tuna . Parents outside Robert Le Kyng primary school in Swindon yesterday slammed the ban on fish. Adele Oliver, who has three children at the school, said her daughter will only eat tuna and the headteacher has advised her to give dry bread instead. She said: 'My daughter eats tuna every day. That is all she eats. 'She likes chocolate spread but I'm not prepared to give her chocolate spread sandwiches every day because that isn't healthy. 'The headmistress has suggested that she just has bread and butter which I think is absolutely disgusting.' Adele added that her daughter has already been asked to eat her tuna sandwiches in isolation when the pupil with the allergy visited the school. She said: 'I work nights and I have to get up at lunchtime and bring her over a tuna sandwich and she has been put in a room by herself when I have given her tuna. 'We've had a meeting to discuss all these other things she's allergic to but in my eyes if her allergies are so severe she shouldn't be in a mainstream school. 'I know she has every right to be educated but if they are so severe she shouldn't be coming to a mainstream school. 'There are over 400 kids in that school and for one child everybody is going out a limb to do everything for her because it is life-threatening. 'It's like sod everyone else. To me, she (my daughter) is my priority - she has to eat every day. 'If she had a serious allergy where she had to eat fish every day, who are they going to make sit outside? 'I am being patient but when you are stressed everyday about what she is going to eat, that's what annoys me. This girl is only in two days a week anyway, she doesn't start in reception until September.' Kirsty Sage, 32, from Swindon, said for a lot of parents it will be difficult to find alternatives as children can be fussy eaters . Kirsty Sage, 32, whose six-year-old daughter attends the school, said: 'I really don't agree with the policy. 'My child is a very fussy eater and it can be difficult to get her to eat quite a few things. 'Luckily for me she will eat things other than fish but for a lot of parents it will be difficult to find alternatives. 'It seems out of order making everyone change their eating habits for the sake of one pupil.' But Maz Hyde, 26, said that she wasn't particularly bothered about the new policy. 'I can definitely see why they would do it but it seems like quite a dramatic step - it's a pretty big policy,"" she said. 'I'm not really that annoyed by it because luckily my son eats other things but it could make things difficult for other parents.' 'As a school with a Special Resource Provision for children with physical disability, we do have children with complex physical and medical needs in the school.' 'This means that sometimes there are minor adaptations that need to be made.' Mrs Smith added that she hoped after more tests by the girl's doctors, the school may be able to alter the ban to make it more specific. 'We do understand that this will have an impact on the choices and diet of some of the other children in our care and this decision was not taken lightly,' she said. 'We hope that over time, as the child has more medical investigations, they will be able to pinpoint the allergies accurately and we will be able to be more specific about what we need to avoid. 'I fully understand that it will have an impact on what can go in children's lunchboxes and if there were an alternative, I would not have taken such a drastic step.' Parent Lee East, who has a 10-year-old daughter at the school with a peanut allergy, thought the measures seemed harsh. He said: 'My daughter has her medication with her at school and with her friends they know she has an allergy and they are very careful around her. 'She doesn't want her friends to suffer because of her allergy. I don't see how this is grounds for banning it. 'If they are going to review it then that's fine. We have been through the same thing. 'My daughter has been into the hospital and had all the same challenges. It just seems that this is going over the top.' This common food allergy includes everything from snail, clams, mussels, oysters, crab, lobster, shrimp, prawn, cod and salmon. Typical . symptoms include nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, wheezing, . flushing, rashes and dramatic swelling of the airways. Some patients . even report that the smell of seafood during cooking causes a problem. In severe cases, food allergies can cause an anaphylactic reaction - when the body goes into shock. Sufferers . should avoid all seafood and locations where seafood is cooked as . sensitive patients may react to allergens present in the vapours of . cooking shellfish. Doctors may prescribe an EpiPen (a medical device . used to deliver a measured dose of epinephrine to combat anaphlyaxis).","Primary school in Swindon says pupil's reaction could be 'life-threatening'

"Covered from head to foot in padded protective gear, but with his extremities still dangerously exposed, this Afghan bomb disposal expert took his life in his hands to defuse this suicide bomber's explosive vest. Security forces captured the would-be martyr before he blew himself up in Jalalabad earlier today, hog-tying the man to stop him detonating the device. But before the suspected terrorist could be taken in for interrogation, the bomb squad had to be called in for the risky job of disarming the bomb strapped across his chest. Scroll down for video . Dangerous work: A member of the Afghan bomb disposal unit approaches a suicide attacker to defuse his explosive vest after he was captured before detonating it in Jalalabad province earlier today . One hundred miles down the Khyber Pass, in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, 17 people were not so lucky. A car bomb exploded there as a convoy of paramilitary troops passed through the outskirts of the city, killing at least 17 people and wounding dozens of others. It was one of three blasts which killed at least 43 people in different parts of Pakistan today, just as David Cameron visited the country's capital pledging help to fight extremism. The heavily armoured Afghan National Army man gingerly, in scenes reminiscent of the blockbuster Hollywood war film The Hurt Locker, approached the suicide bomber wielding naught but a pair of wire cutters. After carefully disabling the improvised device, the suspect was loaded, his face bloodied and still bound by his hands and feet, into a flat bed truck to be taken to a detention centre for questioning. As the U.S.-led coalition which has occupied the country since 2001 negotiates the terms of its withdrawal, it is a task Afghans will increasingly find themselves carrying out. The would-be martyr lies on the ground after his vest was defused: Before the suspected terrorist could be taken in for interrogation, the experts had to be called in for the risky job of disarming the bomb .

In . the deadliest of today's attacks, twin blasts near a Shiite Muslim . mosque in Quetta, the capital of south-west Baluchistan province, killed . at least 22 people, including two women and several children. Senior police officer Ishtiaq Ahmed said 65 others were wounded in the attack.

Designed to maim or kill: A man points to shrapnel damage in the walls of a building near the blast in Quetta . Radical Sunni Muslims have stepped up attacks in the past two years against minority Shiites, whom they consider to be heretics. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack. Suspicion will likely fall on the militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, which has carried out many of the attacks against Shiites in Baluchistan in recent years. In Peshawar most of the dead and . wounded were civilians, although nine paramilitary Frontier Corps troops . were hurt, said police official Shafiullah Khan.

Elsewhere in the north-west, a roadside bomb struck an army convoy and killed four soldiers in the North Waziristan tribal area, the main sanctuary for Taliban and al Qaida militants in the country, said intelligence officials. The blast also wounded 20 soldiers, the officials said.

"A woman who had a threesome with her two lovers to reward them after they murdered her husband has been sentenced to life in jail. Joanna Grabowski arranged for her lover Jacek Pawlak, 42, and his friend Lukasz Kaminski, 31, to kill her husband, disabled Piotr Grabowski, 31, after he refused to allow her to bring a lover back to the house. Piotr was a well-known and popular man in the city of Olsztyn in north-eastern Poland who did a lot for charity. Jailed: Joanna Grabowski (pictured with her children) arranged for her lover Jacek Pawlak, 42, and his friend Lukasz Kaminski, 31, to kill her husband, disabled Piotr Grabowski, 31, after he refused to allow her to bring a lover back to the house . Joanna Grabowski, pictured in court, has been sentenced to 25 years in jail . He was an active member of the Catholic aid charity Caritas and it was there that he met Joanna, 30, who was getting financial assistance from the charity to help her with her five children. The couple had started dating and eventually married, and he had been an enthusiastic stepfather for her five children, but when she told him that she had found a lover and wanted to bring him back to the family home, he told her that he wouldn't allow it. As a result she arranged for Pawlak and Kaminski to kill him when he went to get some fresh air in a local park. Guilty: Lukasz Kaminski (left) and Jacek Pawlak (right) strangled Piotr Grabowski then had a threesome with their victim's wife . Victim: Piotr Graboswki's body was found in a park by passersby . The court heard that she had called them on her mobile phone and told them he was coming, allowing them to hide in the bushes in advance. And as he passed by they dragged him from the wheelchair and strangled him with a trouser belt. Joanna then rewarded them afterwards by inviting them back to the house for sex while her dead husband's body was left lying in the park. He was later found by other park visitors who noticed the abandoned wheelchair and then found the body. Police who were suspicious when interviewing the woman about her husband's death managed to unravel the complicated love triangle by looking at telephone records, and after questioning all three eventually extracted a confession that resulted in the court case. And now the woman has been jailed for 25 years for the murder of her husband. Sentencing of the lovers was delayed pending reports. The woman's five children have all been taken into care.","Joanna Grabowski told her lovers to kill her disabled husband in a park .

"A school inspection was forced to be abandoned yesterday after angry parents confronted Ofsted staff over claims children as young as nine were asked about their attitude to homosexuality. A review of the Olive Tree Primary School in Luton, a Muslim faith school, had to be halted after parents said they would withdraw their pupils from the school if the inspectors remained. Parents were said to be concerned that the Ofsted staff were discussing sex with the children, without their consent. The Olive Tree Primary School in Luton, where an OFSTED inspection was abandoned yesterday . A scheduled meeting between parents and inspectors saw the appropriateness of the questioning raised and after discussions the inspectors withdrew from the school a day early. The chair of the school trust that runs the school, Farast Latif, said that the meeting between the parents and inspectors was largely amicable. Ofsted inspectors left the school following the concern of parents . But added when the inspectors realised the parents were serious about pulling their children out of the school, they left. Mr Latif told the Guardian's Richard Adam: ‘One of the parents said to them, and all of us agreed, this is a safeguarding issue, we are not comfortable about adults speaking to our children about issues of sexuality. ‘When they realised we were serious about that, they left. This is about sexualising young children.’ The Olive Tree primary does not come under the Independent Schools Council and is therefore inspected by OFSTED. Their standards require pupils are taught tolerance of different groups within society. A spokesman for OFSTED confirmed that inspectors withdrew from the school but that sufficient evidence was gathered to complete the inspection. They also added that inspectors were left to their own discretion when asking pupils questions about sexuality. The news that inspectors withdrew from the school comes following reports a similar line of questioning was used on Muslim pupils into an investigation into schools in Birmingham over the alleged Trojan Horse plot. However, an OFSTED spokesman added that questions about sexuality weren’t restricted to predominantly Muslim schools. The Park View School in Birmingham - which, according to whistleblowers, has been infiltrated by Islamic extremists who are attempting to change the school and target young people . A spokesman told the newspaper: ‘As part of any school inspection, inspectors will ask pupils about the effectiveness of the school’s actions to prevent and tackle discriminatory and derogatory language.’ The Trojan Horse plot involves the alleged ousting of headteachers, mainly in and around the Birmingham area, by Islamic extremists attempting to take over several top schools in a bid to target vulnerable young people. Whistleblowers at Park View School in the city have claimed the school is in the hands of a group of extremists who infiltrated the governing body.","Review halted at Olive Tree Primary School, a Muslim faith school, in Luton .

"Middle class students face losing out on places at top universities as growing numbers of them adopt a scheme which prioritises disadvantaged pupils for places. Top universities are signing up to a scheme that means disadvantaged teenagers don’t need to obtain the same grades as their better-off rivals to get a place. Twelve universities including Birmingham, Warwick, King’s College and Bristol are already involved in the Realising Opportunities programme which involved them giving ‘alternative offers’ to disadvantaged students. Top universities are signing up to a scheme that means disadvantaged teenagers don't need to obtain the same grades as their better-off rivals to get a place . And it has now been revealed that three more universities have entered the scheme - Goldsmiths, University of London; Sheffield and Sussex. The Universities say the scheme promotes ‘fairer access’ and will increase the number of pupils from working-class families and poorly performing state schools going to university. But critics say it is unfair to discriminate against hard-working pupils from middle class backgrounds, and say the scheme does nothing to solve the root cause of educational disadvantage. Dr Martin Stephen, former chairman of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) and ex high master of prestigious St Paul’s School, London, said asking universities to address inequality in this way was letting schools ‘off the hook’ and was like ‘applying a bandage to lung cancer.’ Dr Stephen, who is now director of education for GEMS Education UK, said: ‘This isn’t an answer to a problem, it an evasion of a problem. ‘I think it’s because our school system has failed to do the right thing by our children and we want an easy fix. Dr Martin Stephen, former chairman of the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) said asking universities to address inequality in this way was letting schools 'off the hook' ‘Our schools are not helping disadvantaged children to achieve respectable grades and these things don’t do anything about that problem. In fact, if anything, they take the pressure off. ‘It’s like saying that if enough people can’t afford to buy a Rolls Royce, you lower the price. ‘That’s not the point really, is it? It’s acting on the point of supply, not the point of production. We have a supply line that’s not working.’ The move comes amid mounting pressure from the Office for Fair Access (OFFA) on England’s most selective universities to set ‘challenging’ targets to recruit pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. A-Level students who attend a school with below average exam results or high numbers of poor pupils are eligible to join Realising Opportunities. They must meet at least two criteria including live in a ‘low participation’ neighbourhood; be eligible for discretionary payments, free school meals or come from a home where neither parent has attended university. The pupils must have also achieved at least eight A* to C grades at GCSE including English and maths, with a minimum of five at A*/A or B. Students who successfully complete the programme - which includes E-mentoring, online study skills courses and entering an Extended Project Qualification - ‘benefit from alternative offers or additional consideration’ from partner universities, according to the group’s website. It says: ‘Many partner universities will give an alternative offer worth up to two A level grades or equivalent.’ For example, where a middle class student might be told they need three A grades to get into a university, a student deemed as ‘disadvantaged’ would only need three B grades. At Birmingham University, ‘dual offers’ are made to Realising Opportunities students who have met subject-specific entry requirements. This is equivalent to 40 Ucas tariff points and equates to an entry reduction of up to two A-levels grades, such as BBB instead of AAB. Bristol also offers up to two A-level grades lower than the standard offer following completion of the programme. King’s College London, which usually makes offers as high as A*AA in certain subjects, is prepared to go as low as BBB for some RO students. More than 1,200 teenagers from ‘educationally and socially disadvantaged backgrounds’ have been supported through the national programme so far. Universities Minister David Willetts said: ‘The expansion of Realising Opportunities is good news, and will help even more young people from less advantaged backgrounds benefit from the transformational experience of higher education.’ Professor Les Ebdon, head of OFFA, has previously backed the use of differential offers for students from struggling state comprehensives - allowing them to win places with lower grade A-levels than those from high-flying schools. Universities wishing to charge up to £9,000 a year must draw up an ‘access agreement’ - signed off by Professor Ebdon- setting out how they will attract and support students from disadvantaged backgrounds. OFFA has the ultimate power to fine universities £500,000 or ban them from charging tuition fees of more than £6,000 if they fail to widen access to under-represented groups. Earlier this week, Bahram Bekhradnia, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, claimed that UK universities should be more explicit in attempts to ‘socially engineer’ admissions in favour of poor students.","Twelve universities already involved in the Realising Opportunities scheme .

"It is one of the most well-known buildings to pierce London's skyline. And for house hunters scouring the capital for their new abode, Battersea Power Station could soon be a place they call home. But securing one of the most sought-after new addresses in London will come with a price tag to match, as experts predict penthouses will fetch up to £30million each. Scroll down for video . For sale: More than 250 apartments and townhouses built within the iconic Battersea Power Station are set to go on the market on May 1 . Sought-after: Prices will be released by developers in April but experts predict that penthouses will sell for up to £30million each . More than 250 flats built in the imposing Grade II* listed building are set to go on the market on May 1. The new homes will range in size from studio apartments to sprawling five-bedroom 'villas' positioned beneath the four distinctive towers that have stood on the banks of The Thames since 1933. The 254 properties will be located within the existing facades of the western and eastern flanks of the former Power Station and on top of the central boiler house. Those positioned on the boiler house will frame a new 'garden in the sky'. Prices will not be announced until April and the Battersea Power Station Development Company said this second phase of the development will only be up for sale in London. Prospective buyers will have to register their interest and attend allocated sales appointments. The redevelopment of the building will create 15,000 new jobs, 3,500 new homes and a privately-funded extension of the London Underground at Nine Elms and Battersea Power Station. New home: The flats range from studio apartments to sprawling five-bedroom 'villas' with roof terraces boasting views across The Thames . Redevelopment: The newly-modelled Power Station will feature 200 shops and restaurants a state-of-the-art performance venue, cinema, six-acre riverside park and a new Underground tube station, which will connect to the Northern line . Second phase: The latest stage in the development will see flats marketed in London alone, as developers aim to entice people already living in the capital to the new community . Rob Tincknell, Chief Executive of Battersea Power Station Development Company,said: 'This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to own one of a relatively small number of fantastic homes being created in the iconic Power Station itself. 'Having awaited development for 30 years, this famous London landmark is now being restored and given a new lease of life and will be home to events space, shops, restaurants, offices and a limited number of new homes. 'There has been a lot of comment recently about London’s housing problems and we believe the only way to try and solve this is to build great homes and create a community that people actually want to live in. 'We are proud to be launching these new homes in London only, and this decision is part of a wider strategy to create a product well-suited for owner occupiers and people who will help us create a real and lasting community here in Battersea.' The Power Station will form the heart of a wider 40-acre development, which will include office space for around 5,000 people, around 200 shops and restaurants, a state-of-the-art performance venue, cinema and a boutique hotel as well as a new six-acre riverside park.","254 flats built within the Grade II* power station set to go on the market .

A family friend said: 'Euan has been thinking about a career in politics for some time. Cherie is particularly pleased. She likes the idea of a Kennedy-style Blair dynasty.' Dynasty: A family friend has said Cherie Blair likes the idea of her eldest son Euan, left, taking up a career in politics . Friends have said Euan is eager to improve his Labour credibility by taking up a public sector post and he is believed to have left his job with investment bank Morgan Stanley.

A spokesman for Tony Blair's office said: 'The Blairs will support their . children in whatever they decide to . do, but the idea that either of them is interested in a dynasty is pure . invention.' Earlier this month Euan had to walk past . anti-war campaigners as he joined his father at a Labour Party . fund-raiser with Ed Miliband.

Mr Blair wants to get back into the profession after picking up £20million last year through public speaking and advising banks and foreign governments. It is not the first time Euan has hit the headlines, 12 years ago he was arrested by police when he was found vomiting on the pavement in London as he celebrated his GCSE results. The news broke just days after Tony Blair had announced that he wanted to introduce spot fines for anti-social behaviour. After completing his degree in ancient history at Bristol University Euan worked as an intern in the U.S. for Democrat and also Republican politicians.","Mum Cherie 'likes the idea of Kennedy-style dynasty'

"A French media analyst was convicted today of defamation for accusing a state television network of staging a video that depicted a Palestinian boy being killed in a firefight between Palestinian militants and Israeli forces. The footage more than a decade ago galvanised anti-Israeli sentiment, and shaped perspectives of the Mideast conflict during the second Palestinian uprising. The al-Dura case has long stirred emotions in Israel, tapping into a larger sense of the Jewish state being victimised in the media. Scroll down for video . A still from the footage of Mohammed al-Dura, who later died in the gun battle. Philippe Karsenty said the footage was orchestrated and there was no proof that the boy had been killed . Legal action: France-2, which showed the footage, sued for defamation, and after a long legal battle, a Paris court fined Karsenty 7,000 euros today . The footage by France-2 broadcast on September 30, 2000, showed the terrified boy, Mohammed al-Dura, and his father amid a furious exchange of fire in the Gaza Strip. It then cut to the motionless boy slumped in his father's lap. The report blamed Israeli forces for the death. In a report issued in 2004, Philippe Karsenty said the footage was orchestrated and there was no proof that the boy had been killed. France-2 sued for defamation, and after a long legal battle, a Paris court fined Karsenty £6,000 today. He called the verdict 'outrageous'. The al-Dura case has long stirred emotions in Israel, tapping into a larger sense of the Jewish state being victimised in the media. Over the past decade Karsenty has amassed hours of video about the day of the shooting. At the heart of his claim is the fact that, according to the reporting by France-2, father and son were hit by a total of 15 bullets but in the video, neither appears to be bleeding. He says the firefight is real, but the shooting of the man and boy was staged for the camera. 'I am serene because I know the truth will come out,' Karsenty said. 'Despite 15 bullets not one drop of blood was on their clothes, their bodies, the wall they were leaning against.' Remembering: Baraa al-Dura, sister of Mohammed al-Dura poses with a picture of her sibling in Bureij Refugee Camp in the Gaza Strip . Last month, the Israeli government issued a new report on the incident that said the report was misleading, provides no evidence and was part of a smear campaign against the Jewish state. Benedicte Amblard, a lawyer for France-2, said the verdict would allow journalists to retain confidence in their work. France-2 Jerusalem correspondent Charles Enderlin said he and France-2 parent company France Televisions welcomed Wednesday's decision. 'Today's result is a relief,' he said, but added it did not put the matter to rest. Enderlin, a French-Israeli national, said conspiracy theorists continue to hound them over the incident. He said despite years of litigation and Israeli officials accusing him of fabrication, he welcomed an investigation. 'We are ready whenever Israel wants to go for a professional investigation following international standards,' he told The Associated Press. Gaza's militant Hamas rulers said the ruling confirmed that Israel and their supporters lied about the military's practices in the coastal territory. 'They deceive and cover their crimes in front of the media and the world,' said spokesman Fawzi Barhoum. Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said he had no comment on a case that delved into the intricacy of French defamation law. He said, however, that the Israeli position on the al-Dura case remains unchanged. 'It is improbable, not to say impossible, that the bullets which hit Jamal and Mohammed al-Dura came from the Israeli position,' he said. 'Where they did come from remains subject to many hypotheses, though none can be proven.' The second Palestinian intifada or uprising broke out at the end of September 2000 and is named after the Jerusalem mosque complex where the violence began. Frustrations that years of the negotiation had failed to deliver a Palestinian state were intensified by the collapse of the Camp David summit in July 2000. Ariel Sharon, then the leader of Israel's opposition, paid a visit to the site in East Jerusalem known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif, and to Jews as Temple Mount, which houses the al-Aqsa mosque - and frustration boiled over into violence. In one of the enduring images of the conflict 12-year-old Muhammad Durrah is killed during a gunbattle between Israeli troops and Palestinians in the Gaza strip, kindling Palestinian anger about the growing number of children killed by Israeli forces. The army initially apologises, but later casts doubt on whether its forces killed the boy. The Sharm al-Sheikh agreement, brokered by President Clinton, aims to end the upsurge in violence. It breaks down almost immediately.","Phillip Karsenty claimed the footage, shown on French TV, was faked .

"It began with an affair with the boss’ wife - and ended with him becoming a mafia hit man. One of the Colombo family’s most prolific assassins has spoken about the 25 murder plots he took part in, four of them where he pulled the trigger. Larry Mazza revealed how he blasted rivals at point blank range with a shotgun before calmly going home to babysit a friend’s daughter and watch episodes of Seinfeld. Mafia marriage: Big Linda Schiro, right, was wife of mobster Gregory 'The Grim Reaper' Scarpa, a Colombo who once said he had stopped counting the number of his murder victims at 50 . Converted: Larry Mazza was seduced by Linda Schiro when he was 18, and went on to plot 25 murders . He also told how he began an affair with the wife of a notorious mafioso - who incredibly let them carry on even though he knew about it. Mazza’s introduction to the mob began in 1979 when he began a relationship with Linda Schiro, who was married to Gregory ‘The Grim Reaper’ Scarpa. Scarpa famously bragged that after killing 50 people he ‘stopped counting’ during his bloody time as a capo in the Colombo family. Mazza was the straight-laced 18-year-old son of a fire lieutenant and working as a delivery boy in Brooklyn, New York. The boss’s wife was 32, wealthy, powerful and an adviser to her husband on his criminal activities. She invited him over with the words: ‘Do you fool around?’ Mazza told the New York Post: ‘She had beautiful eyes, very Italian looking. She put a bottle of wine out and some M&M’s. We had a few glasses. The next thing you know we were on the couch getting hot and heavy.’ His new lover introduced him to her husband and got him a job collecting debts from a racing track. Soon he became an enforcer forcing people to pay up. Mazza told the newspaper: ‘One got a truck driven through their storefront. Another got visits from us and we’d walk out without paying.’ Head: Victor 'Little Vic' Orena, reputed to be the acting boss of the Colombo crime family, in federal custody in 1992 . Murder followed soon after, he added. ‘The first one, it’s drop me off. Next one, I’d pick him up. Next time, bring a shovel. Baby steps.’ One of Scarpa’s drivers was badly beaten and then killed for trying to kiss his 14-year-old daughter as he took her to school. Then in 1991 a civil war erupted in the Colombo family between underboss Victor Orena and patriarch Carmine Persico, who had been jailed. Persico loyalist Mazza said that ‘for eight months, that’s all we did: wake up and go looking for people to kill’ One of his most bloody executions was in Christmas 1991, that of Orena loyalist Vinnie Fusaro. Mazza said: ‘We were passing by the social clubs where Vic’s guys would hang out. ‘This day we spotted Vinnie’s car, so we came around the block again. He was in his driveway, hanging Christmas lights on the garage. He never seen us. He was facing the garage. Arrested: A civil war erupted in the Colombo family between underboss Victor Orena and patriarch Carmine Persico (pictured) who had been jailed . ‘Greg (Scarpa) had an Army type of rifle, an M52. He says, ‘Don’t even get out.’ He rolls down the window and hit him right behind the ear. It was a hell of a shot. Guy went down like a sack of potatoes. ‘But he shot him two more times - once in the neck and one in the body.’ Another gruesome killing was that of Orena lieutenant Nicholas ‘Nicky Black’ Grancio who was killed despite a ceasefire being in effect. Mazza said: ‘He (Grancio) gets to a house and pulls over. His nephew, Joe Colino, was in the passenger seat. We pull up. ‘We’re in a sedan, and we had a big walkie-talkie and coffee cups in the window and a blue police siren. I can’t believe he didn’t notice us. I just think he was so convinced it was the law. ‘Greg had his rifle, but he was having trouble with the security clip. I had the shotgun, a 12-gauge, double-barrelled riot-control gun stolen from a police car in Lakewood, New Jersey. ‘Greg said, ‘Let’s get him.’ So I opened my window, pulled out the shotgun. I was close enough I could have smacked him. I aimed right behind his ear. I saw his whole face fly off, including his nose, and hit the windshield. It was chilling. ‘His nephew got hit with fragments. He was just screaming. I heard it a block away. ‘We dropped Greg off at the house and drove back to (friend) Jimmy’s house, where we had to babysit his daughter. ‘We had just done something like that, and here we were, playing with his baby, drinking wine and watching Seinfeld.' Mazza’s career nearly came to an end when he had another unpleasant encounter - with his boss. Saving time: Because he informed on allegedly corrupt ex-FBI agent Lindley DeVecchio (right), Mazzo got a lighter sentence than nine years . Scarpa had told him that whenever he was thinking about killing somebody, he sat him in a particular chair and if he got the wrong answer, somebody would come out of the closet and finish him. Mazza found himself in that same chair one day with his boss telling him: ‘You haven’t been the same. I love you like a son and Linda loves you, and I know you two are close.’ Mazza thought: ‘I can see where this is going, and I’m getting nervous. The closet is right behind me. He said, ‘I know what’s going on with you and Linda.’ ” 'I opened my window, pulled out the . shotgun. I was close enough I could have smacked him. I aimed right . behind his ear. I saw his whole face fly off, including his nose, and . hit the windshield. It was chilling.' ‘I said, ‘Greg, I respect you and I think you are far from an idiot. But only an idiot wouldn’t see what’s going on.’ ‘He busted out laughing. Came around and gave me a big hug and walks me outside. And so now I’m feeling better. He says, ‘I can understand how it happened. But nobody else in the world can know. Because if it gets out, the two of us could be killed.’ ‘ . Mazza’s life as a mobster came to an end when he was shot in the eye and then arrested in Florida where he had escaped to lay low. He was jailed for nine years for a string of charges including racketeering and murder, but because he informed on allegedly corrupt ex-FBI agent Lindley DeVecchio he got a lighter sentence. Scarpa died in 1994 of AIDS which he contracted during a blood transfusion. He insisted he just get blood from his own staff, but it turned out one of them was infected. Nowadays Mazza lives in Florida and makes a living as a personal trainer. He dropped out of the witness protection programme and does not fear the mob will come after him. He said: ‘People thought if I followed my father, I could have been a captain (in the fire service) or even a chief. ‘How could this have happened?’","Larry Mazza was working as delivery boy in Brooklyn when he was seduced by Linda Schiro, married to mobster Grergory 'The Grim Reaper' Scarpa .

"Nass and MIT has given a spacecraft orbiting the moon a super high speed internet connection far faster than most users on Earth. The team admit they were stunned by the results, which pave to way for 3D video and remote robotic exploration of other moons and planets. The team say their groundbreaking test 'worked like gangbusters'. Scroll down for videos... ESA's Optical Ground Station (OGS), which houses the Lunar Lasercom Optical Ground System used in the experiment . The test, in October of last year, beamed data, via laser, at speeds reaching 622 megabits per second, to Earth from a spacecraft orbiting the moon. Radio-frequency systems used for space communications today are usually tens of times slower. 'It worked like gangbusters,' Don . Boroson, who led the LLCD design team at Lincoln Lab, and presented the . demo’s results at the SPIE Photonics West conference said. NASA and Lincoln Lab engineers tested the first-ever two-way laser link between the moon and the earth for about a month, according to Spectrum IEEE. 'The system did what it needed to do,' Boroson said. 'The concept is right, and the system is reliable. We think it’s ready for prime time.' NASA’s follow-up laser communication mission, the Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD), which is scheduled for launch in 2017, will attempt to establish laser links at a rate of over 1 gigabit per second between Earth and a satellite in geosynchronous orbit (which is ten times closer than the moon). Nasa is planning to ditch primitive radio transmissions and start communicating with lasers in space. The experiment is part of the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) mission which will be hosted aboard  LADEE satellite (pictured) The LCRD will operate for five years in order to demonstrate the reliability of laser communication technology. As well as HD video it could, for instance, also allow humans to remotely control machines for tasks such as asteroid mining or building structures on the moon. LLCD is Nasa’s first dedicated system for two-way communication using laser instead of radio waves. ‘The goal of the LLCD experiment is to validate and build confidence in this technology so that future missions will consider using it,’ said Don Cornwell, LLCD manager. VIDEO: An overview of the LLCD mission . ‘We can even envision such a laser-based system enabling a robotic mission to an asteroid,’ he added. ‘It could have 3D, high-definition video signals transmitted to Earth providing essentially “telepresence” to a human controller on the ground.’ Since Nasa first ventured into space, radio frequency (RF) communication has been the communications platform used. But it is now reaching its limit as demand for more data capacity increases. According to Nasa, laser communication would be less likely to suffer from interference, another limitation of radio frequency (RF) signals. ‘LLCD is designed to send six times more data from the moon using a smaller transmitter with 25 per cent less power as compared to the equivalent state-of-the-art radio (RF) system,’ said Cornwell. A primary ground terminal at Nasa's White Sands Complex in New Mexico will receive and transmit signals . ‘Lasers are also more secure and less susceptible to interference and jamming.’ The LLCD experiment is hosted aboard Nasa’s LADEE: a 100-day robotic mission designed, built, integrated, tested and will be operated by Ames. The LADEE spacecraft will take 30 days to reach the moon because of its flight path. LLCD will begin operations shortly after arrival into lunar orbit and continue for 30 days afterward. LLCD’s main mission objective is to transmit hundreds of millions of bits of data per second from the moon to Earth. This is equivalent to transmitting more than 100 HD television channels simultaneously. LLCD receiving capability will also be tested as tens of millions of bits per second are sent from Earth to the spacecraft. An MIT team designed, built, and tested the terminal. They will be responsible for LLCD's operation at that site . There is a primary ground terminal at Nasa’s White Sands Complex in New Mexico, to receive and transmit LLCD signals. An MIT team designed, built, and tested the terminal. They also will be responsible for LLCD’s operation at that site. There are two alternate sites, one located at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, which is for receiving only. The other is being provided by the European Space Agency on the Spanish island of Tenerife, off the coast of Africa. It will have two-way communication capability with LLCD. 'Having several sites gives us alternatives which greatly reduces the possibility of interference from clouds,' said Cornwell. Nasa engineers believe this technology is even more exciting for communications beyond Earth’s orbit. In the past, Nasa has experimented with sending low amounts of individual pulses to cameras on far-away space probes near Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury. Recently, an image of Leonardo da Vinci’s painting, the Mona Lisa, was transmitted to Nasa’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft orbiting the moon. ‘But this was done at only hundreds of data bits per second,’ said Cornwell. ‘LLCD will be the first dedicated optical communication system and will send data millions of times faster.’","'Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration' paves the way for 3d video to be sent back from orbit .

"Britain’s economy will not prosper unless its ‘mediocre’ education system is overhauled, a hard-hitting report says today. Failing schools and poorly performing teachers lead to a ‘waste of human resources on a grand scale,’ causing long-term damage to the UK, the scathing document says. Local councils which do not let failing schools close must see their wings clipped, and the system for assessing teachers must be revamped, it argues. Written by a Nobel Prize-winning economist as well as former members of the Bank of England, the report from the London School of Economics calls for radical change to get the UK growing again. It says ‘short-termist’ banks that refuse to lend to small businesses are suffocating innovation. The report has been carried out by the London School of Economics (pictured) and said failing schools are hampering the economy . It also blames ‘years of inadequate investment’ and ‘political procrastination’ over the UK’s ageing transport and energy infrastructure for holding back growth. The symposium has spent the last year looking at ways to help the UK’s moribund economy, which is now teetering on the edge of a triple-dip recession, grow in the long term. The report says: ‘After years of inadequate investment in skills, infrastructure and innovation, there are longstanding structural weaknesses in the economy, all rooted in a failure to achieve stable planning, strategic vision and a political consensus on the right policy framework to support growth.’ The potential of thousands of children from poorer backgrounds are being squandered by underperforming schools, it says. ‘Our failure to provide adequate education to children from disadvantaged backgrounds constitutes a waste of human resources on a grand scale. ‘It holds back economic opportunities and is detrimental to growth,’ the report states. Co-author Professor Tim Besley, a former member of the Bank of England’s influential rate-setting body, said: ‘Rarely are skills thought of as a growth issue. But catching up with Australia or Finland would lead to very significant increase in income for the UK.’ He suggested doubling teachers’ probation periods from two to four years, and assessing them more on the job rather than intensely at the start of their career. Professor Tim Besley suggested doubling teachers' probation periods to four years to raise standards at schools (file picture) ‘We need to focus more on how schools are dealing with disadvantaged children – such as those on free school meals. That is where the big gains in growth will come from,’ he added. It should be easier for underperforming schools to shrink in size, meaning fewer children join them each year, the report also says. It wants local councils to allow failing schools to shrink and successful schools to take on more pupils.Vocational skills are ‘particularly poorly developed’ and should be made more available through more apprenticeships, it adds. The UK’s economy will lag until ‘short-termist’ banks begin lending to small businesses again, the report also says. A lack of competition among lenders is stifling badly-needed investment in innovation and holding back the recovery. The government must make it easier for new banks to enter the market, and high street giants such as Lloyds and RBS could even be broken up to improve competition as a last resort, it says. Despite cutting-edge science, small and medium-sized enterprises cannot get access to funding which could turn their ideas into reality. It says small British firms which ‘punch above their weight’ need to be prioritised by the government’s new Business Bank. Professor Tim Besley said we need to catch up with Australia or Finland . It wants to make obtaining banking licenses easier, and remove other barriers to entry so that the pool for businesses to choose from is expanded. Professor Besley said breaking up existing banks to create more players in the market was ‘an option’ that should only be considered as a last resort if all other schemes to improve lending fail. The report also slams ‘repeated political procrastination’ over large infrastructure projects. ‘Nowhere is the problem of UK infrastructure better illustrated than by airport capacity in the South East, where generations of politicians have prevaricated to a point where there is a serious risk to London’s position as a major hub,’ it states. It calls for a new infrastructure strategy board to be created to decide on the most badly-needed projects, as well as an infrastructure bank to help secure financing. ‘The UK has been incapable of building enough houses to keep up with growing demand,’ it says, and also suggests that road tolls could be introduced to ease congestion. In response to the report, business secretary Vince Cable said: ‘The Government is implementing an industrial strategy in partnership with business to tackle the very issues the LSE’s Growth Commission report identifies. ‘The two most important points coming out of the report are the need for continued investment in skills and innovation, which the department is committed to. ‘Measures like the £1billion business bank to improve access to finance, a £75million package of investment to fund research-intensive and innovative SMEs, investing in record numbers of apprenticeships, and sweeping away red-tape will help create economic growth.’","Report carried out by the London School of Economics says system for assessing teachers must be revamped .

"A football club's giant seagull mascot allegedly challenged his own supporters to a fight after launching into a foul-mouthed tirade during a match. The bizarre spat came after Torquay United's mascot Gilbert the Gull was spotted arguing with the home team's fans as they crashed to a 3-2 defeat against Grimsby Town at the weekend. Shortly after the game, fans took to the Devon team's website to complain about the the character's alleged bad language and threatening gestures, which came as the visitors scored their third goal with 20 minutes to go. The Torquay mascot Gilbert the Gull is alleged to have sworn at his own fans and challenged them to a fight . They accused the seagull mascot of calling the supporters a bunch of c**** before using the gestures towards them. One supporter told the fans' forum: 'Around five minutes after Grimsby scored their third, Gilbert came over to us and shouted ""where’s the drummer!"" 'We all thought he was having a laugh, but then he called us a bunch of ""c****"" and after a few words exchanged he waddled off back to the Family Stand. But Steve Jegat, the man who has been donning the novelty costume for the past year has denied swearing at supporters . 'At the end of the game, Gilbert came over again and in front of us on the pitch, he gave the ""come on then"" body language towards us and wouldn't stop until hiding behind the stewards and again waddling off as we moved towards the exits. 'I (and many others) complained to the stewards about this and I personally spoke to Andrew Candy about this issue and he will be having a word. 'We have the worst mascot in football.' While another supporter added: 'The mascot was, and no doubt about it, offering fans on to the pitch for a fight. 'What would have happened to the club if 10 or more decided to take up the mascots offer and jumped over the wall and on to the pitch?' However, Steve Jegat, a dad-of-two, who has been donning the novelty costume for the past year to gee up supporters denied swearing at the fans in the stand. He said: 'Basically after Grimsby scored their third goal I went over and said ""where’s the drummer gone"" and ended up getting a load of abuse. 'The fans on that side had just given up. But I didn’t swear like they were trying to say. 'I went and told the stewards I’m more welcome at the away end. I even had a load of abuse on Gilbert’s Facebook page when I got home. 'They say that I’m the ambassador for the club but if I’m the ambassador why are they trying to knock me about? '“I’m going to be there for the next home game. I do so much for the club, with charity things and other games, that when the club spoke to me they said ""just stay away from the Popside"". 'I went to a girls’ match the following day, and someone said to me ""99 per cent of the fans are behind you - it’s just the one per cent"".' Torquay United have cleared the mascot to resume his duties at the club's ground Plainmoor, pictured, but banned him from the Popside home stand . Torquay United chief executive Andrew Candy confirmed the club launched a probe into the incident at the Conference Premier League game and that Mr Jegat had been reprimanded for his behaviour. However, he has cleared the mascot to resume his duties at the club's Plainmoor ground but banned him from the Popside home stand to avoid any further trouble. Mr Candy said: 'There was an exchange of views between Gilbert and the fans in the Popside. 'Gilbert was trying to generate some support and get the fans behind the team but it appears that there was a small altercation with the fans. 'There was no malicious intent in what was said but things were said that, in hindsight, should not have been.

"French bureaucrats gathering information for the national census may need to go back to history class after they sent a letter to Napoleon. Official census body Insee addressed a letter to the late French emperor – and were told to forward their request to Saint Peter. Insee is now facing questions about the accuracy of their work as Napoleon has been dead for nearly 200 years. Dear Emperor: The official statistics body in France sent a letter to Napoleon Bonaparte, who died nearly 200 years ago in 1821, for the annual census . The letter caught the attention of a post office worker in Napoleon’s old hometown of Ajaccio on Corsica,’ Connexion reports. The envelope was addressed to ‘Napoleon Bonaparte, 3 rue Saint-Charles, Ajaccio,’ and had been returned with a note reading ‘Died in 1821 - please forward to Saint Peter’. The Corsican post office returned the letter to Insee, France’s national statistics body, with a sticker saying ‘Not known at this address’. Napoleon Bonaparte, who was recently named the second most significant person in human history by American scientists, was born on the French Mediterranean island in 1769. 'No longer at this address': The letter was sent to Napoleon's home town Ajaccio on Corsica, and returned with a note to forward the request to Saint Peter . After rising in the ranks of the French Army, he became the Emperor Napoleon I in 1804. He is most famous for his success as a military leader during the Napoleonic wars. After his luck turned during a disastrous attempt to invade Russia in 1812 he was first to the island of Elba, before he returned to power only to be defeated at Waterloo in 1815. He spent the last six years of his life imprisoned on the British island of Saint Helena where he died in 1821.","French statistics body send letter to French emperor for annual census .

"He is believed to have died after shooting himself in a Berlin bunker in 1945 when he realised Germany had lost World War II. But a startling new book claims Adolf Hitler actually escaped his hideout and died incognito in 1984 in a small town near Brazil's border with Bolivia - and it can be proved by a picture. Not only that, but the author believes the Fuhrer fled to Argentina and then Paraguay before settling in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso to hunt for buried treasure - with a map given to him by Vatican allies, according to its author. Simoni Renee Guerreiro Dias claims this picture proves Hitler lived in the small town of Nossa Senhora do Livramento with his girlfriend, Cutinga . Old clothes meant to be worn by the Fuhrer: An author claims the fascist actually died aged 95 . German Fuhrer Adolf Hitler 'went to Brazil to hunt for treasure' As part of his elaborate ruse to . escape detection, he also had a relationship with a black woman called . Cutinga, which was meant to prove that he could not be the dictator who . hated anyone who did not fit his Aryan ideal, the book claims. Post-graduate . student Simoni Renee Guerreiro Dias has outlined her bizarre . theory, claiming the fascist actually died aged 95. The . book, titled 'Hitler in Brazil - His Life and His Death', challenges . the accepted view that the dictator shot himself in his Berlin bunker on . April 30 1945. She claims . he may have lived as Adolf Leipzig in the small town of Nossa Senhora do . Livramento, 30 miles from the state capital Cuiaba. Simoni, a Brazilian who comes from Cuiaba, says Leipzig was known locally as the 'Old German.' Simoni is now planning to use DNA tests using a relative of Hitler living in Israel, after been given permission to exhume Adolf Leipzig's remains from his alleged final resting place in Nossa Senhora do Livramento. The journalism student has linked the Fuhrer's alleged arrival in the area to a Vatican offer of ownership rights over buried Jesuit treasure in a cave near his adopted home. She points out in her book Leipzig was the birthplace of Hitler's favourite composer Bach. Hitler's Bunker in the Chancellery, Berlin, where many believe he shot himself . The supposed burial site: The Fuhrer 'fled to Argentina and then Paraguay before settling in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso' She says her suspicions about Adolf Leipzig increased after she photoshopped a moustache on to the grainy picture she obtained of him and compared it to photos of the Nazi leader. According to Simoni, an unidentified . Polish nun recognised an elderly man due to have an op at a hospital in . Cuiaba in the early eighties as Hitler and demanded he leave - but was . reprimanded by a superior who claimed he was there on Vatican orders. Academics in Brazil have also rubbished the theory Hitler lived and died in Nossa Senhora do Livramento. Conspiracy theorists have long argued Hitler escaped from Germany and fled to south America. Authors . Gerrard Williams and Simon Dunstan claimed in a 2011 book Grey Wolf: . The Escape of Adolf Hitler, that the Fuhrer fled with his mistress Eva . Braun to Patagonia and had two daughters before dying in 1962 aged 73. The . claims about Hitler's life in Argentina were ridiculed by historian Guy . Walters, who described them as '2,000 per cent rubbish' when the book . was published. He added: . 'It's an absolute disgrace. There's no substance to it at all. It . appeals to the deluded fantasies of conspiracy theorists and has no . place whatsoever in historical research.' Candido Moreira Rodrigues, a history professor at Mato Grosso's Federal University said: 'There's nothing new in people who claim to be historians coming up with the most far-reaching theories about Hitler supposedly living in south America and subsequently dying in one of the countries in this region.' Ten of thousands of Nazis escaped after the war, including the notorious Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengele. Investigators probing Hitler's demise were hampered by the lack of any physical evidence for his death. Fantasists were given added ammunition he didn't die in his Berlin bunker when 2009 DNA tests on skull fragments found near the bunker, believed to be his, turned out to belong to a woman. Rochus Misch, a former bodyguard of Adolf Hitler who has been named as the last man to see the Fuhrer alive during his final hours in Germany, died last September aged 96. Misch, who lived with Hitler and his mistress in their underground refuge as the allies closed in, told before his death he saw Hitler slumped with his head on the table after hearing a gunshot behind his closed door.","Fuhrer 'fled to Argentina and then Paraguay before settling in Brazil'

"Two English Defence League leaders were arrested today as they planed to visit the spot where Drummer Lee Rigby was killed last month. EDL leader Tommy Robinson and his co-leader Kevin Carroll were detained by police on suspicion of obstructing officers in east London as they planned to stage what they claimed was a charity walk to Woolwich Barracks via the East London Mosque. The Metropolitan Police yesterday put conditions on the march and imposed a route between Hyde Park Corner and Old Palace Yard, opposite the House of Lords. EDL leader Tommy Robinson (pictured) and his co-leader Kevin Carroll have been arrested as they planned to stage a 'charity walk' to Woolwich Barracks . In a statement posted on the EDL’s Twitter feed, the group said: 'Tommy Robinson & Kev Caroll arrested for obstructing the police and carted off.' Scotland Yard yesterday said it was imposing conditions due to fears that both the march and gathering would 'result in serious public disorder and serious disruption to the life of the community' and a breach of the conditions would be a criminal offence. The police force issued two notices under the Public Order Act based on 'current community tensions, the current intelligence picture about Saturday and recent marches and protests held by similar groups'. It also said that attempts had been made to liaise with the EDL to facilitate the march and gathering and offered them two alternative routes that avoided Tower Hamlets, home to the East London Mosque. The EDL leaders had planned to visit the spot where Drummer Lee Rigby was killed last month . Alan Green, chairman of the Tower Hamlets Inter Faith Forum, said that an open day was taking place at the mosque today. He . said: 'We are aware that there are those who are fearful of Islam and . who seek to undermine the harmony that exists between the faith . communities in this borough. Our unity here today makes it very clear . that they will not succeed.' Earlier this week, two American political activists who founded an anti-Muslim group were banned by the Home Secretary from entering the UK following reports they were to attend this weekend’s march. Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, who set up Stop Islamisation of America and run the website Jihad Watch, have been forbidden from entering the country on the grounds their presence would 'not be conducive to the public good'. The police also banned the British National Party (BNP) from marching from Woolwich Barracks earlier this month and ordered it to move its protest to Westminster. The event saw rival protesters clash outside the Houses of Parliament, as BNP supporters and anti-fascist campaigners came to blows. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'At approximately 11.25am today, two men were arrested outside Aldgate East station for obstructing police. They have been taken to a south London police station. 'Two further men were arrested on suspicion of assault. They have been taken to an east London police station.'

"Defying death with a series of outlandish stunts on the wings of a plane thousands of feet in the air wouldn't be everyone's idea of fun - but it's all in a day's work for these girls. Members of the world's only aerobatic wing walking team, Sarah Tanner, Danielle Hughes and Stella Guilding perform a series outrageous manoeuvres while strapped to the wings of a plane, as it loops and rolls through the sky at 150mph. And there's no denying the pretty trio of Breitling Wingwalkers have a head for heights as they dance, wave, perform handstands and even hang upside down from the wings of a vintage biplane. Scroll down for video . Brave...or plain mad? Sarah Tanner, Danielle Hughes and Stella Guilding perform a series a death-defying stunts as their Breitling aircraft hurtle through the air . Fearless: One of the wingwalkers clings on as she appears to pose for the camera as her plane lurches into a roll. She is one of four members of the world's only aerobatic wing walking team . Daredevils: The intrepid trio wave, dance...and even perform handstands thousands of feet up in the air as they power through the sky with only harnesses keeping them secure . The fearless females perform up to 100 wingwalks a year as their aviation adventures take them to events across the UK, Europe, China, UAE and most recently Australia. Chief stuntwoman Sarah Tanner, 31, said she'd dreamed of being a wing lady since she watched them at a display with her family when she was a child. She said: 'Wingwalking was something I'd seen at an airshow as a child and was really inspired to see women doing it. 'I've always loved dancing and wing walking is like dancing in the sky, but it wasn't until I was 24 that I first joined. 'I came across a group of wingwalkers at an event and decided to find out more. 'One thing led to another, I auditioned and got the job. I've been doing it for seven years now.' Sarah, who lives in Cirencester with her pilot boyfriend Richard, 35, previously enjoyed a career in event management but said she was delighted to have bagged her dream job. One of only a handful of professional wingwalkers in the world, Sarah not only performs some of the team's most daring stunts but is also responsible for training the team's new recruits. She said: 'To be a wingwalker you can't be taller than 5""4 or weigh more than around eight-and-a-half stone and have to have a head for heights. United: Sarah Tanner (left) and Stella Guilding (right) are perfect for wingwalking, both being under 5ft 4ins and under eight-and-a-half stone . Dream come true: Danielle Hughes told her dad she wanted to be a wingwalker when she was just six-years-old and says the realisation of her ambition is a dream come true . 'The plane travels at around 150mph so you're battling a lot of pressure on the wings and need to build a lot of core strength at the gym. 'We perform a lot of manoeuvres as the plane loops and rolls in the sky. We climb out of the cockpit and onto the wings where we do handstands, lift our legs, hang upside down, wave at the crowd and basically just dance on the plane's wings. 'My favourite manoeuvre is climbing down in front of the pilots and waving, it's a great feeling to be standing at the front of the plane, waving to the crowd below. 'People are always amazed when I tell them what I do for a living. A lot of people think I'm joking at first but they're always really intrigued about my unusual job. 'With all flying there's an element of danger but we're professionals, we train hard and everything is so well rehearsed. 'We always wear a harness and the wire is quite short so if you do slip there's no danger of you being left hanging from the plane. 'When you're climbing around the plane you are hanging on for dear life, you really need to have a firm grip and I've been lucky enough not to have slipped before.' Graceful: The girls do a passable impression of ballerinas in some of their stunts, which require intense concentration and balance . Ultimate thrill: Danielle says the job is like being on the perfect rollercoaster. 'One plane turns upside down above another and I reach down and hold hands with my team mate in one move' Commanders : David Barrell (left) and Vic Norman (right) have the enviable job of flying the plane while the glamourous girls strut their stuff on the outside of the aircraft . Fellow daredevil Danielle Hughes said being a wing walker was a childhood dream come true. The 24-year-old from Wiltshire has been a wing lady since she auditioned for the team six years ago. She said: 'I basically saw wingwalking when I was six and I remember turning to my dad and saying 'that's what I want to do when I grow up. 'When I was 18 a job came up and so I went for it. I had a series of interviews and then had to audition on the wing. I was excited when I first did it, it was such a thrill but it was daunting learning how to climb from the cockpit to the wing. 'The top speed of the plane is 160mph, if you can imagine the feeling of sticking your head out the window while doing 70mph on the motorway, it's twice as much pressure on the wing. With just the open air separating the from the lush English countryside below, the girls have to have nerves of iron as they perform their daring moves . Soaring success: The girls perform up to 100 wingwalks a year as their aviation adventures take them to events across the UK, Europe, China, UAE and most recently Australia . 'It can be difficult at times, particularly if we have to perform in the rain, the rain really stings, it feels like you're being pelted with hail and can really hurt. 'We need to go to the gym regularly as you need to build strength but wing walking is a workout in itself. 'When I'm on the wings I feel really free and it's nice to be able to stand on the wing and wave to the crowd below, particularly if your friends and family have come to watch. Unforgettable: Danielle says the first time she did a stunt was one of the most memorable moments of her life . 'It's like the ultimate rollercoaster, it's such a thrill. 'My favourite manoeuvre is climbing up from the cockpit and back down at the end, I love climbing across the plane. 'We also do this move where one plane turns upside down above another and I reach down and hold hands with my team mate on the other plane.

"Bulgarians and Romanians will flock to Britain in far greater numbers than forecast as our economy races ahead of the rest of Europe, a secret report predicts. After immigration controls are lifted this week, Britons could find their jobs are squeezed in some areas – while community tensions could rise as the new wave of migrants fight for work with other Eastern Europeans who have been settled in Britain for a decade, it suggests. The Home Office-funded review – obtained by The Mail on Sunday – also suggests that the UK could lose out financially if low-paid Bulgarians and Romanians drive out Poles on higher wages, who pay more tax. From Wednesday, Bulgarians and Romanians, known as A2 migrants, will have the same rights as other EU citizens to live and work throughout Europe, but Britain is likely to be seen as more attractive than other countries struggling to make an economic comeback. The authoritative report by University of Reading academics was  commissioned ahead of the change by a group of 74 councils in the South East of England, working with the UK Border Agency, police and health services, but has not been officially publicised. Obtained under a Freedom of Information request, the 40-page report reveals that migration overall was likely to be beneficial to the UK but warns that: . Already overcrowded schools will struggle to find places for the children of the new arrivals. Overstretched hospitals risk coming under fresh strain, and the housing crisis could get worse. The cost to taxpayers of state handouts, such as Child Benefit, could go up. Town halls may fail to collect enough council tax from new immigrants to pay for the extra services because they often crowd into one home and have ‘makeshift accommodation arrangements’. The Government has refused to say how many Romanians and Bulgarians it expects to come. The new report also gives no figures but suggests the recent growth in jobs in Britain, and lengthening dole queues elsewhere in Europe, will encourage more to come here than might be anticipated on previous trends. The study drawn up for the South East Strategic Partnership for Migration says that immigration restrictions ‘are ending when employment across the EU is changing,’ which could have an impact on migration patterns. Bulgarians and Romanians could compete for the jobs of previous immigrants such as Poles . Significantly, it adds: ‘Against this . background it is feasible the UK might receive a larger share of A2 . migrants than in the recent past.’ It . says a crucial issue is whether Bulgarians and Romanians think . Britain’s economic revival is here to stay – if so, it will have ‘a . greater impact on migration patterns’. Our financial turnaround may well be long term. Last week, one forecast predicted the UK economy will outstrip France by 2018 and Germany 12 years later. The authors of the £5,000 Reading university report, Christian Nygaard and Ellie Francis-Brophy, say there is little evidence Eastern European migrants take jobs from British workers overall, though this will ‘vary across localities’. But since 2004, when Poland and seven other East European countries – the so-called A8 – won full rights within the EU, ‘the employment rate of UK-born 16 to 64-year-old residents in the South East has fallen somewhat whereas that of not UK-born other white residents has increased somewhat.’ Worryingly, the report also raises the prospect of tensions between Bulgarians and Romanians on one side and the first wave of Eastern European immigrants on the other. It speculates that lower skilled Romanians and Bulgarians could undercut existing Polish migrants – with damaging consequences for community relations, and potentially the economy, especially if newly unemployed Poles sign on. Igor Kaminski, who has a Polish building firm in London, said: ‘There’s a lot of fear the cheaper end of the market will collapse under pressure from Bulgarians and Romanian workers who, for a short time, will accept any prices.’ THE VIEW FROM HERE: 'I CAME FROM ROMANIA TO WORK, BUT UNSKILLED MIGRANTS ARE A WORRY' By Simon Walters . Talented student Marius Petrea, who came to Britain last year to  pursue his dream of becoming an airline pilot, shares worries that some of his fellow countrymen about to arrive here may not improve his country’s image. Mr Petrea, 27, says he believes many Romanians will take advantage of the relaxation in immigration rules, including some with few skills or qualifications. Mr Petrea, who has a Masters degree in English, was allowed to settle here before the rule change under  exemptions for highly skilled immigrants. He is the model of a bright, hard-working young person who left his native country to seek a better life abroad. ‘I am very proud of my country and came here because I am ambitious,’ said Mr Petrea, who works as a minicab driver, regularly working seven days a week. ‘Quite a lot of Romanians will come here because there are jobs in Britain. I am a little worried that some may live up to Romania’s image as having a low-skilled workforce. ‘That would be wrong because most young people in Romania are educated, hard-working, have strong characters and could have a positive effect in Britain. Many want to come here to earn enough money to educate their own children.’ No one could call Mr Petrea low-skilled. His fluent English reflects the Masters degree he obtained in Romania. He paid for private tuition in maths and physics to improve his chances of achieving his dream of becoming a pilot and is determined to raise the six figure sum he needs to train to get his wings. ‘I will not give up until I have done it,’ he says. THE VIEW FROM THERE: ON THEIR WAY: 34 CRAM INTO A NINE-SEATER BUS . By Martin Delgado . Bulgarians and Romanians are planning to share car journeys or cram vehicles to come to Britain. The rush to migrate was illustrated just before Christmas when a minibus designed for nine people was stopped in the Bavarian city of Passau. It contained 34 Romanians who had left Bucharest en route for an unspecified western country. The vehicle was impounded. Forums on Romanian websites are carrying inquiries from people wanting to share cars or find out the price of petrol for a trip across Europe. It is feared that when they get to the UK, they could elbow British graduates out of the job market. Bulgaria and Romania have a large number of highly qualified IT specialists, entrepreneurs, aspiring lawyers and accountants and many of them speak good English and other languages. Barbara Page-Roberts, a British businesswoman who has lived and worked in Bulgaria since 1985, said: ‘I’ve met young Bulgarians who speak four or five languages. It gives them a flexibility and adaptability that most British job seekers lack.’ Gabriela Milanove, 24, wants a job in digital marketing or web development, but is in no hurry to rush to the UK. With a degree from a Bulgarian University and another from Cardiff Metropolitan University, she said she would like to return to the UK, but not until the furore over so-called ‘benefits tourism’ has died down. She said: ‘Britain doesn’t really want us at the moment. People there think we will be taking their jobs. But I would go if I had a firm offer or a contract.’ Another would-be migrant, Dobrin Dobrev, 36, who speaks English, Russian and some German and French, plans to set up a telecoms consultancy in Britain. He said: ‘I wouldn’t say I am better than a British person but I have travelled to many countries and I am very familiar with Eastern Europe, which has an expanding telecoms market.’ Residents of Maidstone in Kent, identified as having one of the highest concentrations of Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants in the South East, said they feared already oversubscribed schools and hospitals will fail to cope with more demand. Sharon McNeil, 53, said: ‘There’s no room at the schools or extra places. The services are stretched. At my doctor’s surgery you can’t get an appointment for at least two weeks.’ The Reading University report says the impact of migration on public services will be limited ‘in the short run’ because most new arrivals will be young people looking for work, though ‘existing pressure points are likely to be stretched further’. But there will be an impact on schools as one in three Bulgarian and Romanian immigrants are expected to have school-age children – and one in four will have babies – within four years of arriving. Migration Watch’s Sir Andrew Green said: ‘The clear conclusion of this report is that we can expect further migration from Romania and Bulgaria next year. However, they duck the key question of numbers.’ South East Strategic Partnership for Migration manager Roy Millard said the report was designed to assist councils with their planning rather than making firm predictions. He said there were no suggestions that there might be violence but ‘there can be resentments within communities when there is competition for resources’. Meanwhile, councils outside of the South-East have expressed concerns in internal documents, obtained by The Mail on Sunday. Leeds council said increased pressures on housing could lead to growing homelessness, and that both Bulgaria and Romania had high levels of diseases such as tuberculosis, mumps, measles and rubella. Manchester City Council highlighted concerns over its Roma community, saying there were high rates of truancy and teenage pregnancy.  Residents also complained that Roma households ‘appeared to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle without appearing to work’. Despite the fears, virtually no councils have drawn up plans to deal with the expected influx of Romanians and Bulgarians. One exception was Kent, which estimated that the new arrivals could cost it £3 million in extra services, including 390 extra primary school places, though that would be outweighed by the benefit to the economy. David Cameron has announced controversial plans for curbs on benefits and a review of EU freedom of movement laws to end ‘vast migrations’ from poorer European countries.","Bulgarians and Romanians will have the same rights as other EU citizens to live and work throughout Europe, but Britain is likely to be seen as more attractive than other countries struggling to make an economic comeback .

"A teenager was overcome with terror after discovering a python in her bath - which had been slithering around under the floorboards for months. Trudi Evans, 45, was at work when she got a panicked phone call from her daughter Natasha, 17, who had found a 3ft snake in the bath tub. The family, from Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, have since discovered the Royal Python belonged to a previous neighbour - who said it had escaped in July. Hungry: The 3ft Royal Python went missing from a neighbour's home in July and hadn't eaten for months . Panic: Natasha Evans found the 3ft python slithering around the bathtub of her home in Tyne and Wear . Trudi, a garage worker, said: 'I got a phone call from Natasha saying there was a snake in the bath, and of course I didn't believe her, or I thought if anything it was a little grass snake or a worm. 'She sounded really scared so I thought I had no choice but to leave work and go home. I think my boss thought I'd made up some kind of ridiculous lie to get out of work. 'When I got there, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. There was a huge snake as long as my arm in the bath. 'Tasha said she had gone in the bathroom and without really looking leant down to put the plug in the bath and saw the snake out of the corner of her eye and ran out of the bathroom. Snake in the bath:  'If your dog goes missing you put up posters and look for it. They could have at least warned us so we knew to keep an eye out for it,' said Trudi . Worried: Trudi Evans, pictured right, with her daughter, Natasha and pet dog Lucy, said neighbours should have warned them about missing snake . 'She wasn't sure if she'd actually seen it or imagined it, so she opened the door and looked back in and there it was.' Trudi was even more shocked to discover their former neighbours, who bred snakes, had been missing the snake for months. She added: 'The family who used to live next door bred snakes and Tasha went on Facebook to message them and ask if they were missing a snake. 'They said it had been missing since they moved house in July and just thought it was dead so didn't look for it. 'So this snake has been living in the empty house next door since July and must have got under the floorboards and worked its way over to our house. It's terrifying. 'I've got two hamsters, a dwarf rabbit, two cats and a dog - what if it had got hold of them? 'If your dog goes missing you put up posters and look for it. They could have at least warned us so we knew to keep an eye out for it. 'I would have had the house searched top to bottom if I'd known.' The Royal Python is also known as a Ball python, named after its tendency to curl into a ball when stressed . The snake has now been removed from the house, but Trudi is far from regaining her peace of mind. She said: 'Tasha put an appeal out on Facebook asking for someone to come and take the snake and a woman got in touch who rescues them. 'She said it was starving and hadn't ate for months. It was dangerous and to think we don't know how long it's been creeping around under the floorboard. 'I haven't been in the bath since and I'm scared to even go into the bathroom. 'I know it is the kind of thing that makes people laugh because it's so unusual, but it could have been really dangerous as well. 'I'm going to be straight on the phone to get someone to come round and pull all the floorboards up to check there aren't any others. 'If that has been living next door since July, who knows what else is there?' Royal Pythons are also known as Ball pythons and are a non-venomous snake that come from Africa. In the wild, their diet consists mostly of small mammals, such as African soft-furred rats, shrews and striped mice. Pets usually eat rats or mice. Ball pythons are notoriously picky eaters and can go months without food, particularly during the winter breeding season. Other reasons for not eating include: when the python is preparing to shed, stress caused by overhandling, too high or too low a temperature or humidity. They are the smallest of the African pythons and a popular pet. The name Ball python refers to the reptile's tendency to curl into a ball when it is stressed or frightened. The name Royal Python, from the Latin name Python Regius, comes from the fact that African rulers would wear the python as jewellery. Adult Royal Pythons can grow up to 6ft long and have a stocky build, but a relatively small head. The colour pattern is typically black or dark brown with light brown of gold sides and dorsal blotches.","Natasha Evans, 17, called mother Trudi after spotting snake in bath tub .

"New College Pontefract, run by principal Pauline Hagen (pictured), is offering £500 to high-flying students as an incentive to join their new sixth-form . A flagship government free school has been accused of wasting public money by offering high-flying students a £500 'incentive' to join a their new sixth-form. New College Doncaster will hand out the ‘academic scholarship’ to all applicants on course for at least five A grades in their GCSEs. Yesterday, critics branded the incentive ‘bribery’ and not an ‘ethical’ use of public funds. It is thought to be the first time a school has sought effectively to pay high-achieving pupils to sign up to attend. Schools have previously offered money or prizes for good attendance or meeting exam targets. Nearby New College Pontefract applied to the Department for Education last month to set up the school, with the opening planned for 2016. The school will be run as part of the Coalition’s 'free school' programme - which allows teachers, parents and charities to open new educational institutions independent of local council control. The application said Doncaster ‘needs a new college because its young people are missing out on an outstanding sixth-form experience’. To open, the college needs signatures from 1,000 parents, which Pauline Hagen, principal at New College Pontefract, in West Yorkshire, says has already been achieved. It is hoping to open in 2016 with 500 sixth-formers, rising to 1,200 after three years. The website for the new sixth-form advertises an 'academic scholarship' in which: 'If you are predicted to achieve more than five A grades in your GCSEs, we will offer you the opportunity to receive £500 and a place in our Excellence Academy to support your post-16 education.' The proposed sum of £500 has been described as an 'incentive', but the college were not able to say how much it would cost in total. Richard Fletcher, vice principal at New College, told Academies Week all eligible students would be paid the £500, but 'we wouldn't know how many students would receive this until we opened.' A number of free schools have come up against criticism in recent years for opening with very low attendance, with one in south London taking just 17 pupils in September. Stephen Gorard, professor of education and public policy at Durham University, has expressed concern over the use of public money to encourage enrolments in this manner. He said: 'I have never heard of this before and I can't see that it would be an ethical use of funding, given that it would cost money from the public purse that could have been spent on something else.' The college, in West Yorks., is believed to be the first to offer a cash incentive encouraging teenagers to apply . He also raised concerns over the social repercussions it could have on pupils who eventually join. He added: 'There is a correlation between attainment at 16 and family background and advantage and therefore this funding incentive doesn't seem right to me. 'The concern I would have is that if the money incentive attracts the highest-attaining students in the area, then the mix of students at the school might end up with a more socially segregated system because of the association with the attainment of post-16 and social background.' The move follows a similar system operated by universities across the UK which offer a series of incentives to encourage high-achieving students to apply - including huge discounts on tuition fees, free text books and subsidised accommodation. The Department for Education is due to confirm in the next few months whether the sixth-form college has been given approval to progress to the next stage of the applications process. This year, New College Pontefract received an Ofsted rating of outstanding. Ms Pauline Hagen, Principal of New College Pontefract has asked us to make clear that the kind of scholarship described is well established within many universities, schools and colleges and likely numbers eligible will be less than ten. The scholarship will be means tested and therefore arguably not “unethical” as the article suggests. The College will not give the scholarship to everyone that gets high grades. Students will have to meet socio-economic and academic eligibility criteria. If and when the application is approved the eligibility criteria will be available on the website. The scholarships may be awarded in the form of financial support, resources and equipment, not simply cash, as the word ‘bribe’ may suggest.","New College Pontefract will open sixth-form 'New College Doncaster' in 2016 .

"The Clintons are the wealthiest living family to leave the White House, but Hillary Clinton said in an interview released over the weekend that she doesn't think her wealth will turn Americans against her if she runs for president in 2016. The former secretary of state was critized earlier this month for saying she and husband Bill Clinton were 'dead broke' when they left the White House in 2001 - despite making $12 million that year. And since leaving the Obama administration, Clinton has charged $200,000 on average for paid speeches. However, she told the Guardian on Saturday that she doesn't find her income level problematic because she and Bill pay 'ordinary' taxes. Scroll down for video .

The Clintons have made an estimated $155 . million since leaving the White House in 2001, according to financial . disclosure statements, which makes them the wealthiest former first . family in America. Clinton told Diane Sawyer earlier this month that she and her husband charged such steep speaking fees because they were in debt after leaving the White House. 'We . came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt,' Clinton . said. 'We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, . piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's . education.' 'You know, it was not easy.' Hillary . was swiftly attacked as 'out of touch' after the comment, and the morning after the interview aired she clarified that she and her husband had racked up 'something like $12 million' in legal fees by the end of Bill's presidency. 'Bill and I were obviously blessed. We . worked hard for everything we got in our lives and we have continued to . work hard. And we've been blessed in the last 14 years,' Clinton told Good Morning America host Robin Roberts. The . financial 'struggles' the Clintons faced at the end of Bill's second term more than a decade ago are . but a distant memory, however. In the first year Bill was out of office, the Clinton's made $12.3 million. In . 2004 Bill locked down an unheard of $15 million advance for his . autobiography My Life, and, as of last year, he had made $106 million . off of speeches. His net worth as of last February was $55 million, and he has . continued to make money off of speeches since. Hillary . Clinton has made roughly $5 million in speeches since leaving the State . Department last year, and she had made more than $16 million in . advances for her two memoirs, In Living History, 2003, and Hard Choices, . 2014. She also earned approximately $2 million during her second career, first as United States Senator and later Secretary of State. Bill has also accrued $2.6 million of his White House pension. Together, the couple has a net worth of $100 million or more. All former presidents receive an annual pension based on how much they were paid while in office. No other modern president has made quite the killing that Bill has off of speeches and books, however. Jimmy . Carter, who also left the White House broke, has made millions off of . the 14 books he has written. But as of 2012 his net worth was only $7 . million, according to 24/7 Wall Street, and he has done nothing since that would have increased it dramatically enough to rival the value of Bill Cllinton's assets. Likewise, . George W. Bush's estimated net worth is less than half of Bill . Clinton's.  In 2012 he was valued at $20 million after having made $7 . million off his 2010 book Decision Points and $15 million in speeches. His . father, former president George H.W. Bush has a net worth of $23 . million, but much of that comes from the value of his home and a 100+ . acre estate he owns in Maine. In his hey day, H.W. Bush would charge anywhere from $60,000 - $80,000. In 1993 H.W. charged a record-breaking $100,00 for a speech. Bill Clinton has since topped that with a $750,000 speech. Bill and Hillary Clinton outside their home in upstate Chappaqua, New York. It was worth an estimated $1.7 million in 2001 . The Clintons own several homes, including this three-storey house in Washington DC. The average home in the neighborhood is valued at $6,586,000, according to real estate website Trulia . President . Barack Obama has the lowest net worth of all the living presidents, . coming in at $5 million. Most of that money can be attributed to the . royalties he received on the two books he wrote before becoming . president, the 1995 hit Dreams from May Father and his 2006 book The . Audacity of Hope. In terms of the richest presidents ever, Bill Clinton ranks in the top 10. The wealthiest American president in history, according to 24/7 Wall Street, . was John F. Kennedy, who left behind $1 billion in shared assets with other members of the Kennedy family. His wife, . Jackie Kennedy Onassis, was also very wealthy, and upon her death in . 1996, her estate was valued at $43.7 million. Bill Clinton is the richest of the five living U.S. presidents.

"Researchers at Bowling State University found that overweight students, especially girls, are less likely to get into university than skinnier students . Winning a place at the best universities can be difficult enough - and now American scientists believe how much you weigh could influence whether you are accepted. Researchers at Bowling State University found that overweight students, especially girls, are less likely to get into university than skinnier students. The group of psychologists studied almost a thousand applications for postgraduate courses and found that academics favoured thin candidates in face to face interviews. However, there was no significant difference in success . rates when conversations were carried out over the phone or when . credentials were assessed remotely. Psychologist Jacob Burmeister and colleagues at the university asked 97 applicants for psychology graduate programmes at more than 950 universities in the US whether they had an interview in person or on the phone, and whether or not they received an offer. Dr Burmeister said: 'When we looked at that we could see a clear relation between their weight and offers of admission for those applicants who had had an in person interview. 'The success rate for people who had had no interview or a phone interview was pretty much equal, but when in-person interviews were involved, there was quite a bit of difference, even when applicants started out on equal footing with their grades, test scores and letters of recommendation.' The study, which was published in the journal Obesity, also suggested the weight bias was stronger for female applicants. The researchers examined letters of recommendation - a common feature in the application process for winning a place at US universities - and identified positive and negative statements in them as well as the overall quality of the letters. Dr Burmeister said:'One of the things we suspected was the . quality of their letters of recommendation written by their undergrad . mentors would be associated with the applicants' body weight, but it . really was not. Psychologists studied almost a thousand applications for postgraduate courses and found that academics favoured thin candidates in face to face interviews . 'It may be that letter writers come to know students well and body weight no longer played a factor.' Previous studies by British researchers have found overweight people, especially women, are less likely to be hired because employers assume they will be lazy, and when they do get a job tend to be bullied, earn less and are often overlooked for promotion. In the poll of 200 bosses, a quarter of men said they would turn down a candidate purely on their weight and one in ten admitted they had already done so. Dr Burmeister admitted his researchers were not surprised by their findings. He said: 'We know these kinds of biases are pretty common and even somewhat acceptable compared to other biases and there is not much legally forbidding it.' The success rate for people who had had no interview or a phone interview to win a place at a U.S. university was pretty much equal, but  there was a difference between overweight and slimmer candidates who did face-to-face interviews, even when their grades were similar . He said additional research is needed into other fields as well as psychology into the issue and the results could reveal an even stronger bias against people with a high body mass index. As the study examined the issue in psychology departments at universities, the findings might be particularly shocking. Dr Burmeister said: 'We might expect psychology faculty to be more aware of these types of biases. Thus, the level of bias found in this study could be a conservative estimate of the level of bias in the graduate admissions process in other fields.'","American scientists found that overweight students are less likely to get into university than skinnier students .

"A mother with postnatal depression killed her two babies because she had delusions that they would be seized by social services, a court heard yesterday. Jewellery designer Felicia Boots, 35, suffocated her ten-week-old son Mason and 14-month-old daughter Lily days after the family had moved into a new £1.4million home in an area known as Nappy Valley because it is popular with young, rich families. She has been detained in a mental hospital after the judge said prison would be 'wholly inappropriate'. Today a family friend revealed Boots tragic history as he told how her brother had committed suicide four years ago. George McRae, who lives near Boots’ parents Dave and Debbie Sinclair in Ontario, Canada, said there was a history of depression in the family. He said: 'Something should have been done to help her sooner. You notice things about people, you know something is wrong.' Felicia Boots, 34 who smothered her ten week old son Mason, and 14 month old daughter Lily Skye, was suffering from postnatal depression when she smothered them and laid them side by side in a wardrobe . Jeff Boots, who discovered his children's bodies, is supporting his wife who had become worried that her antidepressants medication was harming her son . McRae, who lives near Boots’ parents Dave and Debbie Sinclair in Ontario, Canada, said her brother Scott Sinclair had apparently hanged himself four years ago after moving to Toronto and abandoning his religion.In a tragic twist, he said Boots had branded the act “selfish” at the time telling them: 'Now my kids will never know their uncle.'Mr McRae told the London Evening Standard: 'Felicia told us that he had killed himself. She said he didn’t like having this religion jammed down his throat.'He added that Mr Sinclair had also suffered from depression and was on medication before his death.Boots had also had to deal with the break-down of her first marriage to Dale Morgan.The couple had married while she was still a teenager and it did not last long, but she was reportedly devastated after the split. Yesterday Mrs Boots wept as she admitted two charges of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Her not guilty plea to two murder charges was accepted by prosecutor Ed Brown QC. Her . husband, who was in court, is standing by his wife. Mr Brown said Mr . Boots had written ‘a moving statement supportive of his wife in very . sympathetic terms’. Boots' husband Jeffery, an investment . banker, returned home that evening to find the house in darkness and . his wife sitting on the stairs, hugging herself. She . had tried to kill herself but inflicted only superficial damage to her . neck. Woman suffering postnatal depression has admitted killing her two . babies who were then discovered dead by their father at the family's . home. He ran upstairs and found their children lying side by side on the floor of a walk-in wardrobe in the master bedroom of the semi-detached house in Wandsworth, south-west London. They had apparently been strangled with one of his ties, the Old Bailey heard. Mr Boots, 35, was heard wailing: ‘My lovely son, my beautiful daughter. They have gone. Help me, help me, help me.’ His wife had been diagnosed with postnatal depression after the birth of both children. She had been prescribed antidepressant medication and her condition outwardly appeared to be improving. Hours before she killed her children she sent a photograph taken on her mobile phone of Lily to her husband, who took this as a sign that she was feeling better. He was unaware that she had stopped taking the medication because she was worried about its side effects while breast feeding despite reassurances from her doctor. Computer records show she made a series of Google searches about her concerns in the preceding weeks. Felicia Boots counsel read a letter to the court from the mother, who said that she would never forget the events of May 9 - the day she killed her children. It read: 'May 9, 2012, is a day I will be eternally sorry for. 'It should never have happened. 'It troubles me more than anyone will . ever know. 'Part of me will always be missing. 'I am a good person. 'I am a . good mum and I never meant any of this to happen. 'I am truly sorry.' In a note found next to the bodies she ‘questioned how she could have done such a thing’. She wrote how ‘she was scared and sorry’ and that her ‘life started to fall apart a few weeks before’. Her husband called the emergency services but paramedics were unable to save the children. His wife, who was ‘unsteady and weak on her feet’, was arrested. Mr Boots told officers at the scene that his wife was a good mother and he ‘could not believe that she would do such a thing’. Felicia Boots is reported to have been found curled up in a ball as the body of her baby boy lay in a wardrobe . A picture of a young child taken from Felicia Boots' Facebook page believed to be her young daughter who died in the family home in Wandsworth . Forensic investigation: A forensic officer walks into the family's house in Wandsworth where paramedics were unable to save the children . Mr Justice Fulford said a prison sentence would be ‘wholly inappropriate in this case’. He ordered that she be detained at a mental health unit until doctors deem her fit for release. ‘This is an almost indescribably sad case,’ said the judge. ‘Although the roots of Mrs Boots’s actions were profoundly tragic given the loss of two such young lives, what occurred was not what most people would regard as criminal activity. ‘I unreservedly accept that what the defendant did to the two children she and her husband loved and nurtured, was solely the result of psychological and bio-physiological forces that were beyond her control. Mr Justice Fulford said: 'I unreservedly accept that what she did . to the two children, that she and her husband loved and nurtured, were . the results of physical and biological factors beyond her control' ‘This has always been a happy family. This is someone who delighted in . being a mother and she was good at it. 'This case is the polar opposite . of the appalling incidents of child neglect and cruelty that sometimes . come before the courts.’ Canada-born Mrs Boots had married a fellow Jehovah’s Witness shortly . after she left high school but the marriage failed when she left the . church. She married Mr Boots in August 2007 and the couple moved to the . UK in 2008. Although most women have the ‘baby blues’ for a short time, one in ten . goes on to suffer full-blown clinical depression which is unlikely to . improve without treatment. Four women in every 1,000 giving birth have to be admitted to hospital, . Jeff Boots and his wife Felicia Boots were a 'contented couple'. Mrs Boots had begun to suffer from depression and left a note saying she could not explain why she had killed her children . 'Nappy valley': The family live in a new £1.4million home in Wandsworth, south-west London (pictured) in an area known as Nappy Valley because it is popular with young, rich families . Postnatal depression typically develops in the first one to two months after childbirth, but can develop several months later. Low mood, believing you are unable to cope and difficulty sleeping are all common symptoms of the depression. Mood changes, irritability and tearfulness are all common after birth but normally fade shortly after birth. If the symptoms persist, it could indicate postnatal depression. As long as postnatal depression is recognised and treated, it is a temporary condition you can recover from, the NHS assures patients. It is very important to seek treatment as it is unlikely to 'cure' itself. Treatment for postnatal depression includes self-help advice, cognitive behavioural therapy and antidepressant medicine. PND is thought to be the result of several things including physical and emotional stress of looking after a newborn baby, hormonal changes and social problems inclduing anxiety over money. Women deemed more at risk of PND are those who have a previous history of depression. Source: NHS .","Jeff Boots still supports wife Felicia after she smothered their two babies .

"A Utah high school teacher charged with raping her 16-year-old student pleaded not guilty Thursday to three counts of first degree sexual assault. Brianne Altice, 34, was an English teacher at Davis High School in deeply Mormon Kaysville, Utah when she was arrested in October for the alleged sexual relationship, which reportedly began in a church parking lot and included at least three sexual encounters. The 16-year-old boy admitted to investigators in November that he had had sex with Altice on three occasions in 2013 and testified to that fact at a preliminary hearing February 19. Scroll down for video... Day in court: Former high school English teacher and accused rapist Brianne Altice appeared in a Utah court Thursday to face charges she repeatedly had sex with her 16-year-old student . In her arraignment Thursday, Judge Thomas L. Kay also scheduled a jury trial for May 12. The blonde former teacher appeared collected in the Utah courtroom and chose to wear a close-fitting top, slim pants and conspicuously high heels. According to the Standard-Examiner the teen said in the preliminary hearing that he was upset because his family had moved to Utah from another state. He said he was having problems and home and doing drugs and that he would skip class to hang out with Altice. Fighting it: Altice pleaded not guilty to three felony counts of raping the 16-year-old. But the boy told police they had sex multiple times in 2013 before her October arrest and that their first sexual encounter was in a church parking lot . Poised: The 34-year-old Utah woman no longer teaches at the school. Her husband filed for divorce in November shortly after her arrest . Soon a sexual relationship began after an initial encounter in a church parking lot, he said. The teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of Altice's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body. Altice's husband filed for divorce shortly after his wife's arrest. It was finalized in December. 'The defendant occupied a position of special trust in relation'. to the juvenile, prosecutors wrote. Mug shot: Altice allegedly had sex with the 16-year-old numerous times at her home and at a park and a church parking lot . Altice was originally arrested in October. Altice was believed to have had sex with a 16-year-old on many occasions, including at her South Weber home and at a park in addition to the church parking lot, a Davis County Jail report states. Police have said there may be other potential victims. Altice was only hired by the high school last August, but had previously worked for other schools in the district since 2004. ‘Anytime . a story surfaces like this ... I think it all causes us concern because . these are members of the community that are held to a higher standard,’ district spokesman Chris Williams told Deseret News. Altice is the fourth Utah teacher currently facing charges of sexually abusing children. Arrest: Brianne Altice, 34, a teacher from Kaysville, Utah, has been charged with three counts of rape . The 17-year-old boy, a student at Davis High School, admitted to investigators on Monday that he had had sex with Altice at least seven times between January of 2012 and October of 2013 .","Brianne Altice, 34, was a teacher at Davis High School in Kaysville, Utah .

"The Scottish mansion of disgraced former RBS boss Fred Goodwin has vanished from Google Street View just weeks after the search giant acknowledged users' 'right to be forgotten'. The former banker's £3million home, in an exclusive suburb of Edinburgh, can no longer be viewed online - unlike the rest of his street. Usually, users of the service can use Google to be shown street-level photographs of almost everywhere in the UK. Vanished: Former RBS chief's Edinburgh home, pictured, can no longer be viewed on Google's street view . Hidden: Most of the area of Edinburgh where Mr Goodwin lives, marked in blue, is visible on the service. But a small area, circled, which contains his house can no longer be seen . But a small section of its map service - which covers the former banker's home and was once freely accessible - has since disappeared. The search engine automatically blurs and obscures details such as faces and car numberplates to avoid breaching residents' privacy. Mr . Goodwin, whose management of the Royal Bank of Scotland contributed to . the disastrous financial crash of 2008, has been held up as a figurehead . of capitalist excess. His house - one of two in the Scottish . capital - has previously been targeted by vandals, who smashed windows . at the home in 2009 as a protest against his riches from banking. Catastrophic: Mr Goodwin, pictured, resigned from RBS in disgrace in 2009. A month later the bank announced a £24billion loss. The former chief executive was stripped of his knighthood in 2012 . Close: Users can approach Mr Goodwin's house, but images further than the one shown have been erased . Google could not confirm whether Mr Goodwin had requested the removal, though insiders suggested it was in fact a bug in the system which stripped out the pictures. But a spokesman for the search engine confirmed that it has always been possible for users with a 'compelling case' to convince them to remove images of their homes. The company has been hit by a huge increase in requests to remove data from its search archives after a European court ruled that in favour of citizens' 'right to be forgotten'. The legal decision means that companies holding vast quantities of data - such as search engines - can be forced to take down information which is deemed 'inadequate, irrelevant or excessive'. It is designed to allow people to suppress embarrassing information about their pasts if it is no longer relevant. Services such as Google Street View would not be covered by the ruling - but there are fears that it could make it easier for people such as disreputable businessmen and minor criminals to cover up their past. Fred Goodwin became one of Scotland’s best-known . figures after his career in banking took off in 2000 and he presided . over the Royal Bank of Scotland’s rapid rise to global prominence with . assets of £1.9trillion . However, the ruling does include an exception for those who have prominent roles in public life. Mr Goodwin, nicknamed 'Fred the Shred' in the City because of his ruthless approach to business, shot to prominence in 2000 and built RBS into a world financial player with a series of takeovers and mergers. He was knighted in 2004 for 'services to banking', shortly after being named Global Businessman of the Year by Forbes magazine. But the bank - once valued at almost £trillion - began racking up huge losses, and eventually needed an enormous taxpayer-funded bailout. The Government continues to own 64 per cent of the bank's shares. Mr Goodwin's house was targeted by anti-capitalist protesters in 2009, three months after he resigned as RBS's chief executive. He quit just one month before RBS unveiled a £24billion loss on its 2008 trading - the largest annual loss ever reported by a UK company. Over the following years a chorus of outrage directed at Mr Goodwin continued to swell, culminating in his being stripped of his knighthood in 2012. Mr Goodwin could not be reached for comment.","Shamed ex-banker's Edinburgh home vanished from search service .

"The Israeli military has identified the three teens, one reportedly a 16-year-old American, who were abducted by terrorists in the West Bank on Thursday.

Frenkel’s mother said her family is in close contact with the security forces and getting briefings on any new information, reports NBC News. ‘We feel and know that they are turning the world in order to find the three,’ Racheli Frenkel told reporters. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, left, has accused the Islamic militant group Hamas of kidnapping the teenagers, including Gilad Shaar, right, after Israeli troops arrested some 80 Palestinians in overnight raids . After thanking Israelis for their prayers, she also issued a heartbreaking message directed at her son. ‘Mommy and Daddy and your brothers love you until the end of the world and you should know that the people of Israel are doing all they can to bring you back home,’ she said. Israel's prime minister and President Shimon Peres have both reached out to the families of the missing teens. ‘We are one nation, we are one family and I want you to know that all of Israel is with you during these difficult times,’ Peres told them on Saturday, according to the president's office. Peres also said that all branches of Israel's security forces are ‘doing everything to bring our boys home,’ adding that ‘the people of Israel are praying for their safe return.’ Israeli soldiers patrol an area in the West Bank town of Hebron on June 15, 2014, as they search for three teenagers who went missing near a West Bank settlement . The crisis has escalated already . heightened tensions between Israel and the new Palestinian government, . which is headed by Western-backed President Mahmoud Abbas but backed by . Hamas. Palestinian militants . have repeatedly threatened to kidnap Israelis, hoping to use them as . bargaining chips to win the release of prisoners held by Israel. This would be the first time three civilians have been taken at the same time. The overnight raid was concentrated in the southern West Bank city of Hebron, in the area where the youths disappeared. A Hamas website said more than 60 of those arrested were members, including senior figures in the movement. The Israeli military also detained supporters of Islamic Jihad, a smaller Palestinian militant group. Israeli soldiers search for three teenagers who are believed to have been snatched from the Gush Etzion settlement bloc between Bethlehem and Hebron, reportedly while hitchhiking . ‘Palestinian terrorists will not feel . safe, will not be able to hide and will feel the heavy arm of the . Israeli military capabilities,’ military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner . said. The Palestinians' self-rule government, which administers 38 percent of the West Bank, has . insisted it is not to blame, saying the teens went missing in territory . under full Israeli control. ‘The Israeli government cannot blame the Palestinians for security issues in areas that are not controlled by them,’ said Ehab Bseiso, the spokesman of the Palestinian unity government. He also condemned what he called the ‘latest Israeli military escalation against the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza and the Israeli air attacks on Gaza, which led to the wounding of several Palestinians.’ Asked about Netanyahu's claim that Hamas carried out the kidnapping, Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestinian official, said that ‘this is something we have no information on.’ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused militants from the Islamist movement Hamas of kidnapping the teenagers . In its first statement on the issue, Hamas praised the kidnapping but did not claim responsibility. In . a message sent to journalists, it referred to ‘the success of the . kidnapping’ and said that ‘the movement pays tribute to the heroes who . are behind the kidnapping.’ In the Gaza Strip, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri dismissed Netanyahu's claims of Hamas involvement in the abductions as ‘silly.’ Hamas governed Gaza for seven years before striking the unity deal with Abbas. It remains in de facto control of the coastal territory, which is separated from the West Bank by Israel. Despite the exchange of accusations, security officials from Israel and Abbas' forces have been cooperating closely in the West Bank trying to find the kidnappers.","Naftali Frenkel was captured along with Gilad Shaar, 16, and Eyal Yifrach, 19, on Thursday .

"Public school pupils are being discriminated against when they apply for places at Oxford and Cambridge, a leading headmaster has claimed. Dr Anthony Seldon, the Master of the . prestigious Wellington College described the 'hostility' towards these students as 'the hatred that dare not speak its name.' There are cases of some parents allegedly putting their children into local state sixth forms to give them a better chance of getting into Oxbridge. 'Hostility': Dr Seldon, the Master at Wellington College, claims there is discrimination against public school pupils who apply to Oxbridge . David Cameron has tried to 'disown' his Eton-educated background because of the public 'jealousy' of independent schools, said Dr Seldon. He told the Daily Telegraph that at Wellington there were 62 pupils clever enough to get an interview at Oxbridge, but he expected only 20 to be offered places. 'From our perspective it looks as if some public school students are being discriminated against at the final hurdle,' he said. 'Was that different to when I was at Oxford 35 years ago? Yes. I don't think anyone gave a toss back then where you came from, only that you were good enough to go.' He added:  'Positive discrimination in favour of state school people has become the hatred that dare not speak its name.' Top public school: There are 63 pupils who are clever enough to get an Oxbridge interview but only 20 will be offered places, according to the headmaster . This year, according to the paper, Cambridge has reduced the number of places it is offering to independent schools to 200 with almost two-thirds its students coming from state schools and colleges. The dilemma facing parents of privately-educated children is highlighted in the Sunday Telegraph's Seven magazine tomorrow with the case of  a QC with two daughters at the Catholic boarding school St Mary's Shaftesbury, Dorset. He took away the cleverer of the two at 16 and sent her to the local state sixth form because . he believed it would improve her chance of a place at Oxbridge. Last October, private school leaders raised the prospect of boycotts against any university found to be systematically discriminating against their pupils in admissions. They are incensed that more than half of top universities have set specific targets for admitting more state school pupils under pressure from the Government to widen the social mix of students. Headmasters are demanding that universities such as Cambridge and University College London are banned from setting targets which classify students according to the type of school they attended.","'Hostility' towards independent school .

"When introduced to pupils as ‘Professor’, she may not have expected them to appreciate her academic achievements – but she did expect them to address her accordingly. Instead, Jennifer Coates says she was ‘demeaned’ by the youngsters simply calling her ‘Miss’. Professor Coates described it as ‘a depressing example of how women are given low status and men, no matter how young or new in the job they are, are given high status’. Infant and junior boys sitting at their desks in the 1930s, as pictured here, would not have dreamed of calling a female teacher 'Sir'. But academics believe this is a sexist hangover from the past . Australia: Mr, Mrs, Miss or Ms and surname . China: Surname and Lao-shi (Teacher) France: Monsieur or Madame . Germany: Herr or Frau . India: Teacher, Madam or Sir . Japan: Surname and Sensei (Teacher) Korea: Full name and Seon-saeng-nim (Teacher) Mexico: Miss and name if female, or Professor and name if male . Pakistan: Miss or Sir . Russia: First name and surname . Spain: Seno for women and Profe for men . Sweden: First names . US: Mr, Mrs, Miss or Ms and surname . Now the emeritus professor of English . language and linguistics at Roehampton University has called for the . traditional titles ‘Sir’ and ‘Miss’ to be banished from schools to stop . sexist views taking root among pupils. Her call was backed by several other academics – including one who said teachers should instead be called by their first names. Professor Coates told how she had . been introduced to pupils at Harris Girls’ Academy East Dulwich, where . she was volunteering, as ‘Professor Coates’, but they soon reverted to . calling her just ‘Miss’. ‘The men on the staff are all in . their twenties and they were all called Sir,’ she said. ‘Sire is what . you called the king. And Sir is a knight. There weren’t women knights . but Miss is ridiculous: it doesn’t match Sir at all. ‘It’s just one of the names you can call an unmarried woman.’ She said that for both men and women using their ‘title plus last name would be better’. Professor Coates, who taught a course . for undergraduates on sexist language, warned that terms such as ‘Sir’ and ‘Miss’ risked reinforcing the message that ‘women are lesser beings . to men’. Their use dates back to the 16th century, when schoolmasters were often of a lower social status than the children they taught. They insisted on being called ‘Sir’ to reinforce their authority, education historian Jacob Middleton told . the Times Educational Supplement. Meanwhile women in the late Victorian . era were discouraged from working once they married, leaving schools . mainly staffed by men and single women referred to as ‘Miss’. School girls are influenced by the 'discriminatory' way male teachers are called 'Sir' while their female counterparts are referred to as 'Miss', according to academics . Robin Lakoff, professor of . linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, in the US, said . that Sir for male teachers ‘always conveys respect’ while Miss does not. ‘It’s very hard to create linguistic equality between people who, in many people’s minds, aren’t equal,’ she said. ‘At school, we have children who are . still really only learning language. They pick up on it very readily and . then the next generation gets exposed to the prejudices of the previous . generation.’ Professor Sara Mills, from Sheffield . Hallam University, urged schools to abandon titles altogether and allow . pupils to use first names. But Debbie Coslett, chief executive . of the Brook Learning Trust, which runs three schools in the South East, . said: ‘If I’m in a school where students don’t know me and they call me . “Miss”, I’m fine with that.

"Keeping a respectful distance on the dance floor, no short skirts and no alcohol-fuelled after-parties: this is no normal prom. In fact, it's the eighth annual 'Mormon Prom' in Morristown, New Jersey, a night of modesty at a decorated basketball court at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Nearly 300 students aged between 16 and 18 gathered at the hall on Saturday - some traveling from outside states to attend - for a night of good clean fun. Good clean fun: Teenagers maintain a respectable distance as they dance during a Mormon prom at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Morristown, New Jersey on Saturday night . Date night: Richard Murray, 18, and Allison Garner, 18, share a dance at the prom, which is open to all teens . The event, . which started after local teens complained about lewd behavior at their . schools' proms, was open to students of any religious affiliation, not . just Mormons. But all had to abide by its rules - no drinking, inappropriate clothing or alcohol. 'There is no pressure to do anything . immodest or reckless, like party or drink afterwards,' Anna Jensen, . a Mormon who attended the dance with two Catholic friends, told the New Jersey Star-Ledger. 'The music was . clean and the dancing was also clean. Overall, it was just a group of . kids, Mormon or not Mormon, that wanted to enjoy themselves without . being influenced by what our modern society believes to be the norm.' The students were encouraged to skip the usual pricey practices, such as buying new dresses or arriving in a limousine, and most were taken by their parents, who then socialized together in a separate room. Alternative night: Students are dropped off by their parents, instead of taking extravagant limousines . Cheese!

'I'm going to my school prom in May,' Norton, a fellow Mormon who attends Morristown High School said. 'The types of dancing and music will be very different. It will be more inappropriate at the school prom.' And he added: 'Girls still look good in modest dresses.' The prom began eight years ago when students complained to their parents about their high school dances, the Star-Ledge explained.

"Dr Rory Fox (pictured) is considered a 'superhead' who is hired to fix failing or struggling schools . A headteacher appointed to save a failing school has accused teachers of bullying junior staff and being lazy, late and aggressive in a damning letter written to union representatives. Dr Rory Fox took on the role at Ryde Academy on the Isle of Wight as a  'superhead' to turn around the school's standards which were rated inadequate by Ofsted last year. The headteacher, who has previously taught at a prison, has made headlines in the past with his commitment to enforcing strict adherence to school uniform policies. But in a leaked letter sent to union representatives, he claimed '50 per cent of the teaching at Ryde Academy is not good enough', with some teachers lazy, late to class, bullying junior staff and refusing to set homework,The Times reported. It stated: 'We are finding practices in classrooms that could easily lead to disciplinary action, but I am choosing not to go down that route.' According to the letter, one teacher told Dr Fox his day finished at 2.40pm and he couldn't mark students' work because he was going sailing, while others complained about setting homework. MailOnline has requested comment from Ryde Academy regarding the contents of the letter. In April last year an Ofsted report revealed the school was suffering from 'serious weaknesses'. Inspectors said they did not witness any 'outstanding lessons' and about a third were were considered 'good'. Other problems were that younger students didn't feel confident reporting bullying and teachers were failing to act when bad language was used towards staff or when there was homophobic language, swearing or name calling between students. However, the watchdog reported four months ago that these problems appeared to be improving with senior leaders understanding new responsibilities, and improvements in students' safety were having a positive effect. The school has made headlines before. It was in June that Dr Fox decision to pull more than 250 girls out of lessons at Ryde Academy for not adhering to the school's dress code. As part of the crackdown, girls - aged between 11 and 18 - whose skirts were deemed too short, were either sent home or placed in an isolated hall. Others were also sent home to change because their trousers were ‘too tight’ and did not fit with the school’s strict new policy. Some of the teachers at Ryde Academy (pictured) on the Isle of Wight are lazy and late to class, it has been claimed . Dr Rory Fox carries with him a reputation for an uncompromising and tough stance in his management of schools, earning him the label of a 'superhead'. Previous to recent school roles, he worked as the Head of Learning at Edmunds Hill Prison in Suffolk, a no doubt challenging role which typically involves overseeing a prisons' teaching resources and increasing prisoner education rates. He has also worked at Basildon Academy in Essex, with both parents and teachers saying the effects of his clamp down on ill-discipline were 'remarkable'. It was there he sent home 151 pupils for wearing trainers with Velcro, the wrong trousers, an unsuitable school bag and in one case, a gold hairband. This policy continued at Ryde Academy when he took 250 girls out of lessons in a massive uniform crackdown. Recent Ofsted reports appear to justify his stance - despite a slow start, within the space of a year inspectors have noted the school's improvement in areas such as student safety and learning outcomes. And boys were also reportedly turned away after arriving at lessons with non-leather shoes. Dr Fox defended the decision to send the pupils home and claimed several girls were under peer pressure to wear inappropriate uniform. He said: ‘We are preparing students for the world of work so it is important that we teach students about the importance of managing their appearance and working to a dress code. ‘Dealing with uniform issues helps us to improve general attitudes of co-operation and the skills of following instructions. ‘This helps us to improve behaviour and learning in classrooms. ‘A significant number of teachers have already commented on how much better behaviour in lessons has become, as soon as we started dealing with uniform issues.’ It was not the first time he had taken drastic measures to fix ailing dress code. In 2011, on his first day at Basildon Academy in Essex, he sent home 109 pupils  for wearing incorrect uniform.","Leaked letter shows headteacher concerned about 'lazy and late' teachers .

"Distressed: Frances King,  headmistress of Roedean School in Sussex, is leaving because of the pervading negative attitude towards private schools in the UK . The headmistress of a leading independent school for girls condemned hostile attitudes to private education yesterday as she revealed she is quitting Britain for a job abroad. Frances King, head of Roedean for five years, said she was fed up with being ‘always on the negative side of public opinion’. Private schools had been through a ‘bruising time’ and the Government ‘cannot afford to be supportive’, she claimed. Mrs King will leave the UK to become director of an international school in Switzerland – Collège Alpin Beau Soleil – in the summer. She said she found it ‘quite hard work’ working against a tide of disapproval in Britain. While UK private education was increasingly sought-after among overseas parents, Britain itself was unable to celebrate its success and heritage, she warned. ‘It is quite hard work to continue to be always on the negative side of public opinion,’ said Mrs King who became head of Roedean, in East Sussex, in 2008. She added that Roedean was ‘making sure we have got a good amount of money put into bursaries and, as much as we can afford in our situation, we are trying to ensure widening access’. The school was also staying focused on its core purpose of providing ‘top quality education’, she said, but it was ‘hard work’ pursuing this in the face of national disapproval. Fellow headmistress Vicky Tuck expressed similar sentiments when she left Cheltenham Ladies’ College for a school in Switzerland in 2011. She said she was made to feel ‘slightly immoral’ for running a fee-paying school. ‘There are things about England and British education that are quite irksome – you have constantly to defend independent education,’ Mrs Tuck said at the time. ‘Many of us in the independent sector work very hard and feel at times we have to apologise for what we’re doing.’ Grand: Schools like Roedean should be celebrated for the quality of their education not castigated just because they are private, Mrs King says . Roedean School, on the outskirts of Brighton, has been one of Britain's leading girls schools ever since it was founded in 1885. Boarders pay more than £31,000 a year for the privilege of studying there, while the fees are around £18,000 for day girls. The school boasts an indoor swimming pool, a theatre, 15 tennis courts and a chapel. Its distinguished alumnae include pioneering nurse Dame Cicely Saunders, creator of the 'A to Z' Phyllis Pearsall, and Ursula Graham Bower, an anthropologist who became a guerilla warrior fighting against the Japanese invasion of Burma. Anthony Seldon, master of Wellington . College, warned last week that private school pupils were beginning to . feel the effects of a ‘hatred that dare not speak its name’. He criticised ‘jealousy and hostility’ towards independent schools and warned that public school pupils were . being ‘discriminated against at the final hurdle’ when they sent off . their university applications. Mr Seldon said there were 62 pupils at . Wellington bright enough to get an Oxbridge interview this year, but he . expected only 20 offers of places. At Roedean, where fees for boarders . are up to £31,350 a year, half of pupils are now from overseas. Oxford-educated Mrs King, who was . previously head of Heathfield School for Girls, Ascot, said some . boarding schools in Britain were a throwback to the days of the British . Empire, when children were sent home to be educated. She told the Times: ‘They are still . struggling on. There was a boom period when local British people decided . that boarding was just the best thing; that is now changing, perfectly . reasonably – you want your child at home.’ Strong schools such as Roedean would continue to thrive but others would ‘find the market too tough’.","Frances King is leaving Roedean because of disdain for UK's fee-paying schools .

"The stunning feat of engineering is set to inject the United Arab Emirates with a dose of high culture, attracting millions of tourists from around the globe. But human rights campaigners report that  workers at the Saadiyat Island site, where the impressive Guggenheim and Louvre buildings are being constructed are being mistreated. In an 82-page report, Human Rights Watch acknowledged that Emirati authorities had taken 'positive steps' to improve working conditions for the mainly South Asian workers in Abu Dhabi. Workers and journalists at the Louvre museum construction site on Abu Dhabi's Saadiyat Island . But the organisation claims that employers are withholding wages, confiscating passports and housing workers in substandard accommodation. It interviewed 113 current and former labourers who had worked on the project during 2013 and 2014, according to the report. All of those interviewed said employers held their passports and did not reimburse them for recruiting fees they paid and some said they were not paid salaries for months, faced arrest and deportation for striking, and were housed in 'cramped and unsanitary housing.' Saadiyat Island is the brainchild of Tourism Development & Investment Company (TDIC), of which Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority is the sole shareholder. The whole project, a dream holiday island complete with beaches, promenades, luxury hotels, restaurants and shops, is due to open in 2020. TDIC immediately rejected the report's findings, calling them 'unfounded' and 'outdated and based on unknown methodologies'. The Saadiyat Island master plan, with an imagining of the impressive Guggenheim structure in the foreground . 'We have established a comprehensive Employment Practices Policy (EPP) outlining the standards required from the companies working on our projects, and laying out penalties for those found to be in breach of any aspect,' it said. The company added that it had set up a housing facility and been praised by many, including British members of parliament, senior foreign diplomats and museum partners, and all workers have access to their passports and 99 percent are provided with medical insurance. Plans for a museum were originally announced in Paris in 2007 and an opening date of 2012 was suggested. But the £405 million 'floating' art gallery, is finally due to open this year. It will cover 64,000 square metres including 9,200 square metres of art space. Human Rights Watch say the United Arab Emirates have not done enough to end the exploitation of migrant workers at the Saadiyat Island construction site . Reports of worker mistreatment first surfaced in 2009, with Gulf Ultra Luxury Faction issuing a report accusing contractors of poor pay and holding passports to prevent them leaving the country. Human Rights Watch say  the United Arab Emirates have not done enough to end the exploitation of migrant workers. It said that while only 'a small percentage' of workers were subjected to abuse, the prestigious foreign institutions involved should demand commitments by the United Arab Emirates to protect workers and compensate them for mistreatment. 'NYU, the Louvre, and the Guggenheim should surely understand by now that they can't blindly accept the UAE authorities' assurances that workers' rights are being respected,' HRW's Sarah Leah Whitson told AFP news agency. The Louvre and Guggenheim museums are set attract millions of tourists from around the globe . 'They need to exert their influence much more forcefully and demand much more in return for their presence on Saadiyat Island.' In a joint statement, the Louvre and Agence France-Museums said the HRW report contained 'known elements'. They assured that 'the French side is very concerned about the social compliance at the site of the Louvre Abu Dhabi since the beginning of the project'. The Solomon R Guggenheim Foundation added that  'areas for improvement remain'.","Human Rights Watch report cramped, unsanitary housing and delayed pay .

"Dartmouth college has suspended 64 students accused of cheating in a sports ethics class and charged them with breaking the exclusive Ivy League school's honour code. College officials confirmed the number of students charged but declined to comment further until the appeals process ends later this month. The students under investigation are all  athletes who were being given special classes in ethics and religion. Prof Randall Balmer noticed he was receiving far more answers to his questions than students in the class . Dartmouth College suspended 64 students for cheating in an ethic class (suspended students not in picture) Professor Randall Balmer confirmed that most of the students had been suspended for a term. The alleged scandal involves hand-held electronic clickers which are used to answer questions during college classes. It is believed that some students may have passed their clickers onto their classmates who answered the questions on their behalf. According to The Boston Globe, the scandal was unearthed after Prof Balmer noticed that he was receiving significantly more answers to his questions by electronic clicker than the number of students sitting before him in the lecture theater. Prof Balmer described the situation of cheating in an ethics course was ironic and 'very sad and regrettable on many levels'. He said: 'A lot of the students will probably come away with a stain on their transcripts. And, a level of trust that is so necessary for students and teachers has been betrayed, and I feel sad about that.' Prof Balmer reported his concerns, which initially involved 43 of the 280 students in the class. A further 21 came forward after details of the investigation were made public. The college confirmed that honour code violations were considered 'major misconduct'. Prof Balmer added: 'I think honour no longer is something that has a lot of resonance in society, and I suppose in some ways it’s not surprising that students would want to trade the nebulous notion of honour with what they perceive as some sort of advantage in professional advancement.' According to college newspaper The Dartmouth, Prof Balmer has decided against failing those students found guilty of cheating and instead reduced their grades by one letter. More than seven in 10 of the students on the course are members of the various college athletics teams. Prof Balmer said: 'Part of the reason I designed this course was that I had the sense that some athletes coming here to Dartmouth might have felt just a little bit overwhelmed or intimidated academically. 'I wanted to design a course that would appeal to their interests and allow them to have an early success in the classroom, and I’d hoped that they would be able to build on that success throughout their time at Dartmouth.'","64 students have been accused of cheating in an ethics and religion class .

"Russian politicians and media were last night demanding Vladimir Putin goes further by grabbing back more former Soviet regions and states. The nationalistic frenzy whipped up by the return of Crimea - in defiance of the West - has led to calls on state-run TV for Moscow to take back oil and gas-rich Kazakhstan and authoritarian Belarus as well as more slices of a battered Ukraine, already filleted by the Kremlin. Putin was last night riding the crest of an adulatory wave after righting what many Russians see as an historical wrong and reintegrating Crimea and the Black Sea fleet headquarters of Sevastopol back in to Russia after a gap of 60 years. On the crest of a wave: Russian President Vladimir Putin stands next to Crimean Premier Sergey Aksionov as he addresses a rally in Red Square, Moscow, celebrating  Crimea's decision to join with Russia . Cult of personality: Russians hold flags adorned with Putin's face and a slogan reading 'We are together!' Pro-Kremlin activists march across Red Square: Putin pushed every emotional button of the collective Russian psyche as he justified the incorporation of Crimea into the Russian Federation . Senior politicians openly mocked Western sanctions and discounted Putin's assertion that he did not seek more of Ukraine as long as the West stops seeking sway in his backyard. The Russian strongman defiantly told a joint session of the Russian parliament that he would not accept NATO 'next to our home or on our historic territories'. Accusing the West of hypocrisy in pushing for self-determination for Kosovo but denying Crimea, he said the peninsula had been 'robbed' from Russia in Soviet times while 'regions of Russia's historic south' were only now Ukrainian because of a Bolshevik blunder. In an emotional and historic address he said: 'In the hearts and minds of people, Crimea has always been and remains an inseparable part of Russia.' Adoring public: Putin was last night riding the crest of an adulatory wave after righting what many Russians see as an historical wrong and reintegrating Crimea and the Black Sea fleet headquarters of Sevastopol . Nationalistic fervour: Dozens of Russian flags flutter in the breeze below a typically overcast Moscow sky . Mr Aksionov, the new Crimean premier, raises his fist as he shares the stage with Speaker of the Supreme Council of Crimea Vladimir Konstantinov, left, and head of Sevastopol city administration Alexei Chaliy, right . Putin has succeeded in uniting many of his foes behind him but last night it also appeared he had unleashed a tidal wave in favour of more land grabs. Senior politician Sergei Mironov hailed 'the great day when the gathering of Russian lands began'. Sergey Zheleznyak, deputy chairman of lower house, demanded Russian 'support' for other Ukrainian regions. 'We cannot feel calm and happy as long as we realise how our brothers in other regions of Ukraine are suffering,' he said. A prime time TV talk show speculated about restoring the sovereign states of Belarus and energy-rich Kazakhstan in a substantial remaking of the Soviet Union, while also calling for the historically Russian cities of Donetsk and Odessa in Ukraine to be returned. Meanwhile a campaign was underway for the breakaway republic of Transdniestria - in Moldova - to follow Crimea back into the embrace of the Russian bear. With some parliamentarians in tears during Putin's historic speech - when he officially welcomed Crimea and Sevastopol back to Russia - only his prime minister Dmitry Medvedev, caught napping during the barnstorming address, failed to join the patriotic fervour punctuated by standing ovations. Politicians queued up to pour scorn on Western sanctions with deputy speaker Sergey Zheleznyak branding them a 'kindergarten measure' and close Putin ally Igor Sechin accusing the U.S. and EU of 'hysteria'. Turning back the clock: An elderly woman holding a calendar depicting Soviet leader Josef Stalin celebrates in Sevastopol after watching a broadcast of Putin's speech on Crimea . Another demonstrator in Sevastopol holds the hammer and sickle in the same hand as the flag of the Russian Federation as crowds celebrate their decision to secede from Ukraine following the Western-backed coup . Tsar Vladimir: Thousands of pro-Russian people watch Putin's speech on big screens in Sevastopol . Stage-managed patriotic celebrations were marked across Russia's nine time zones yesterday. In Moscow, residents were urged by officials to fly Russian flags from their balconies to 'celebrate' the return of Crimea. Ukraine watched helplessly as Putin and Crimean leaders penned an agreement restoring the territory to Russia. Senior diplomat Yevhen Perebyynis warned: 'What has made the entire world shudder is the real rebirth of Russian imperialism, for which nothing is sacred, neither internationally recognised borders of sovereign states, nor the rights and freedoms of citizens, nor international obligations.' Kiev protested that the move 'has nothing in common with law or democracy or common sense'. But in a warning to the world, the country's foreign ministry said: 'Putin's address very clearly demonstrates just how real the threat is that Russia poses to international security and international security.' Changes: Workers dismantle a Ukranian language inscription reading 'The Supreme Council of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea' in central Simferopol, the Crimean capital . Ukrainian volunteers were queuing to sign up for a newly-created National Guard amid fears that the threat of invasion from Russia remains, or that Putin will use alleged 'saboteurs' to spark riots and political protests in major cities. Kiev claimed it had uncovered 'convincing evidence of the participation of Russian special services in organizing unrest in the east of our country.' Last night it was claimed a Ukrainian naval officer was shot twice in the leg seeking to defend a naval facility from pro-Moscow attack in Crimea. But Putin insisted: 'The residents of Crimea and Sevastopol turned to Russia with a request to protect their rights and their lives. We could not have rejected their appeal and left them in trouble.' He complained that the fall of the USSR left Russia 'the biggest divided nations in the world' with millions of compatriots waking up in a foreign country. In Ukraine, ethnic Russians were undergoing 'forced assimilation' in a country where 'neo-Nazis' played a key role in decision making. Drink: Crimeans toast with local bubbly after watching a broadcast of Putin's address to the Federal Assembly . A Russian Navy officer watches the broadcast in Sevastopol: It came after Ukraine's new leaders watched helplessly as Putin and Crimean leaders penned an agreement restoring the territory to Russia . A woman jumps for joy during the broadcast: Kiev protested that the move 'has nothing in common with law or democracy or common sense' Western diplomats saw him as using rhetoric which could act as justification for future military adventures to restore other areas of the old USSR. But Putin told Western leaders to 'stop the hysteria' and respect his country's national interests. 'They keep trying to drive us into a corner', and could have grabbed Sevastopol for themselves. NATO members 'are great guys, but it's better for them to come visit us in Sevastopol, than for us to visit them there'. Crimean clocks are to be switched back two hours later this month, so they tick by Moscow time. Putin ordered three official languages in his new province - Russian, Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar. The Kremlin last night began pouring roubles into Crimea but was eyeing the seizure of 20 warships in the Ukrainian navy which are stranded here. Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev - often seen as a Putin critic - hailed Crimea's vote to join Russia as a 'happy event.'","Senior Russian politicians mock Western sanctions imposed in response .

"Millions of healthy Britons are about to be given statins needlessly and exposed to debilitating side effects which include muscle pain and diabetes, leading doctors warn. They say NHS proposals to radically increase the uptake of the drugs are a ‘public health disaster’ that will cause harm to many patients. The group – which includes cardiologists, and senior GPs – is urging the government and the NHS drugs watchdog NICE to halt the plans. They also claim that eight of the 12-strong panel of experts who are drawing up the guidelines have financial links to drugs firms making statins – which stand to make a profit. 'Disaster': Millions of healthy Britons are about to be given statins needlessly which could lead to a 'public health disaster' if the NHS does not halt the plans, leading doctors warn . About seven million patients in Britain take statins to lower the cholesterol in their blood to prevent heart attacks and strokes. They are predominantly given to over-65s who have been diagnosed with heart disease or have a high risk of developing it based on their family history or lifestyle. But in February, NICE – National Institute for Health and Care Excellence – published draft guidance advising GPs to prescribe statins to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke within the next decade. It claims this could save many lives at a minimum cost to the NHS as the drugs cost as little as 10p each. Experts say this would lead to the drugs being given to between five and ten million additional patients. NICE will publish its final guidelines next month. But the group of doctors say there is no evidence that giving statins to healthy people increases their life expectancy. The group wrote to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to warn of the consequences of increasing statin prescriptions . On the contrary, they point to evidence showing they increased the risk . of diabetes in middle-aged women by 48 per cent and cause fatigue and . muscle pain. The group also accuse NICE of looking only at evidence about benefits and possible side effects of statins that have been provided by drugs firms, which could be biased. The leading doctors also argue that rather than prescribing statins, the NHS should be encouraging patients to lose weight and take more exercise. In a letter to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and NICE, they wrote: ‘The consequences of not withdrawing this guidance are worrying: harm to many patients over many years, and the loss of public and professional faith in NICE as an independent assessor. ‘Public interests need always to be put before other interests, particularly pharma [the drugs industry].’ Professor Simon Capewell,  professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool,  one of the doctors against the move, said: ‘The statin recommendations are deeply worrying,  condemning all middle-aged adults to lifelong medications of questionable value.’ Dr Malcolm Kendrick,  a GP  and member of the BMA General Practitioners sub-committee, who is also a member of the group said: ‘Who knew that millions of people  in the UK now suffer from statin  deficiency syndrome? Mass statination is a triumph of statistics over common sense. ‘Treating millions at a cost of billions based on data we are not allowed to see is an example of the corporatisation of medicine and will result in a public health disaster.’ And Dr David Newman, director of clinical research at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, said: ‘For most people at low risk  of cardiovascular disease, a statin will give them diabetes as often as it will prevent a non-fatal heart attack.’ In response, Professor Mark Baker, director of the Centre for Clinical Practice at NICE, said: ‘Cardiovascular disease maims and kills people through coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease and stroke. Together, these kill one in three of us. Our proposals are intended to prevent many lives being destroyed.’ Concerns have been raised that eight of the 12-strong panel recommending widespread use of statins have financial links to the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture them. They include Dr Anthony Wierzbicki, chairman of the NICE panel and a heart disease specialist at Guys and St Thomas’ Hospital in London, who has ties to six firms, including Pfizer, Sanofi and Aventis, which sponsored his research into cholesterol-lowering drugs. Dr Michael Khan, a heart specialist at University Hospitals of Coventry and Warwickshire, has been paid by drug companies investing in heart drugs to give lectures and sit on advisory boards. They include Amgen, a US firm which makes statins that has sponsored him to run a clinical trial. Emma McGowan, a specialist heart nurse who also works at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, was sponsored by statin manufacturers AstraZeneca for the first year of her job. She was also paid by the same firm to attend conferences. Dr Robert Dermot Neely, heart specialist at the University of Newcastle, has been paid by statin makers Roche, Genzyme and Aegerion to sit on advisory boards. The experts declared these conflicts of interest to NICE. The Mail contacted them for comment but did not receive a reply.","NHS proposals to put more patients on statins 'potential disaster'

"Rebel fighters from Islamic militant group ISIS have captured four more towns in Iraq including a crossing on the border with Syria. Qaim, Rawah and Anah all fell to rebels fighters yesterday, while civilians in the town of Rutba are negotiating a surrender after units stationed on the outskirts threatened to start shelling. The towns, the first to fall in the mainly Sunni province of Anbar, were captured as Shiite volunteer soldiers marched through Baghdad as the country heads towards sectarian war. Scroll down for video . Policemen check cars in Baghdad today after news that ISIS militants have made more gains in the west of the country, seizing control of four more towns . Forces in Baghdad are on high alert for an attack after ISIS took control of large parts of the west of Iraq . Meanwhile, in the north, Iraqis queue up outside an Iraqi airways office trying to flee the country after soldiers withdrew from the province . The capture of Rawah, situated on the Euphrates River, and the nearby settlement of Anah, also raises the prospect that ISIS militants are marching towards a dam at Haditha. If the dam and adjoining power station were destroyed, it would cripple the country's power grid and cause widespread flooding. Iraqi military officials said more than 2,000 troops were quickly dispatched to the site of the dam to protect it against a possible attack by the Sunni militants. Rawah's . mayor, Hussein Ali al-Aujail, said the militants ransacked the town's . government offices and forced local army and police forces to pull out.

Yesterday they captured Rutbal, Qaim, Rawa and Anah, bringing them within striking distance of the Haditha dam (left). Meanwhile government forces have been amassing in Baghdad (right) Rawah and Anah had remained under government control since nearby Fallujah fell to the Sunni militants in January. The . capture of a border crossing at Qaim has allowed ISIS to move heavy . artillery and vehicles from Syria with ease for use on Iraqi . battlefields. Troops have long been able to cross unimpeded. Syrian rebels have already seized the facilities on the Syrian side of the border and several other posts in areas under their control. Today in Fallujah, ISIS militants have been pictured patrolling the streets towing heavy artillery pieces . In Fallujah, under the control of ISIS rebels, there have also been bombings which destroyed part of this house . Residents from Fallujah have been bringing fuel from Baghdad to power boats as they hope to cross the Euphrates River into the government-controlled south . Police and the army said the Sunni insurgents seized Qaim and its crossing, about 200 miles west of Baghdad, after killing about 30 Iraqi troops in day-long clashes on Friday. The officials said people were now crossing back and forth freely. Chief . military spokesman Lt Gen Qassim al-Moussawi acknowledged Qaim's fall, . saying troops aided by local tribesmen sought to clear the city of . 'terrorists'. The . news will come as a fresh blow for prime minister Nouri Maliki, who has . been desperately defending his position since ISIS began its lighting . assault. As ISIS made further gains in the Sunni west of the country, Shiite volunteer soldiers marched through Sadr city in Baghdad in a show of force . Forces loyal to anti-Western cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, a Shiite, joined in the marches which also took place in the southern cities of Basra and Amarah . Mr Maliki's Shiite-dominated government has struggled to push back against Islamic extremists and allied Sunni militants who have seized large swathes of the country's north. The militants took control of the second-largest city of Mosul on June 10 as Iraqi forces removed their uniforms and fled without firing a single shot. The prime minister, who has led the country since 2006, has been increasingly forced to turn to Shiite militias and volunteers to bolster his beleaguered security forces. Parades . took place in Sadr city, Baghdad, yesterday along with other cities in . the mainly Shiite south as a show of force after weeks of terrible . defeats for the government. The . marches revealed the depth and diversity of the militia's arsenal, from . field artillery and missiles to multiple rocket launchers and heavy . machine guns. The military hardware on display yesterday, including missile launchers, heavy artillery, rocket launchers and machine guns, show how deadly a religious conflict could become . Mr Maliki has come under growing pressure to reach out to disaffected Kurds and Sunnis, with many blaming his failure to promote reconciliation for to the country's worst crisis since the US military withdrew. Yesterday members of the Kurdish special forces were pictured being hugged by Shiite civilians in the country's north west after defending them from ISIS. The unlikely images came after decades of violence between the two peoples which saw thousands of Kurds gassed by Suddam Hussein. In Baghdad, about 20,000 militiamen loyal to anti-US Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, joined marches through the sprawling Shiite Sadr City district.","ISIS militants capture Qaim, Rawah and Anah in Iraq's Sunni west .

"Schoolchildren have been banned from playing traditional games tag and British Bulldog because teachers claim they are too dangerous. Parents of children at Egerton Community Primary near Bolton, Greater Manchester, were told in a newsletter that children can no longer play the playground games. In the letter, the school says: 'What we have observed is a situation where children were being hurt because they were not moving about the playground safely and because they were playing games that, in a smaller space, were causing them to have accidents. Banned: Children at Egerton Community Primary, Bolton, are no longer allowed to play tag or British Bulldog . 'It is not acceptable for us to accept that children will get hurt while playing and it is our job to ensure that the playground and playtimes are organised well to ensure safety.' Pupils may use the playing . fields when the weather is good, but the majority of the year have break . times in the playground. A group of parents have now launched an online petition calling for the decision to be reversed. Kirstin Jackson, 40, from Egerton, who launched the campaign, said: 'I started the petition because I want my kids to be able to run around. 'It's a real shame that children can't be children. There are times when you've just got to let them be kids.' The petition, which already has more than 50 signatures, states that participating in games such as tag far outweighs the occasional accident. Mrs Jackson, a teaching assistant at another school whose two sons attend Egerton Community Primary, added: 'Accidents happen, it's normal, it gives children the opportunity to measure their own risks, and it's a learning curve for them.' Anger: A petition has now been started calling for the decision to be reversed (library image) Another mother with two children at the school, who asked to remain anonymous, added: 'I just think children need to be children, we can't wrap them up in cotton wool. 'I do understand it is for the safety of the children and that the school wants to prevent accidents but there are so many benefits children get from playing games like tig. Accidents do happen but it's all part of growing up.' But bosses at Egerton Community Primary have defended the decision, and stressed alternative play zones had been created for games like football and basketball. Headteacher Sam Mitchell said: 'Following a number of injuries to pupils, the school reviewed safety in the playground and has asked pupils not to play tag and British bulldog. 'Instead, to improve safety and enjoyment for all children, the school has introduced play areas identified for a range of activities co-ordinated by a play leader. 'Children have been asked to respect each other's play and safety and have told us that they are enjoying their new playtimes.'","Children at Egerton Community Primary, Bolton, banned from playing traditional games following several injuries, school says .

"One in five graduates now go on to be worth more than £1million . One in five graduates who hold at least one university degree go on to become a millionaire, according to new data. Official figures from the Office for National Statistics show that 20 per cent of all adults who complete higher education - equivalent to more than two million people - have a wealth of £1million or more. In contrast only three per cent of people who have assets totalling more than £1million have no formal qualifications. The figures also reveal that education is becoming more important to becoming a millionaire as in 2006-07, only 16 per cent of graduates were worth more than £1million. David Willets, the universities minister said the new study reveals why going to university is a very good deal, despite rising tuition fees. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'It shows why it’s fair to ask graduates to pay back the cost of their higher education, and why increasing the number of people who go to university will spread wealth and opportunity.’ In addition the figures also show that Britain’s richest families own almost half of the country’s household wealth. The wealthiest 10 per cent of households hold 44 per cent of the total money tied up in property, pensions, possessions and hard cash. Amazingly more than one in 10 people own a second home and a similar proportion can call themselves millionaires. How the richest 10 per cent own 44 per cent of all household wealth . Pensions and property make up the biggest slice of household wealth . Since 2006-08, the proportion of families with possessions with more than £60,000 has risen sharply . In 2010-12 the combined wealth of all private households in Great Britain was £9.5 trillion, up by almost 12 per cent £8.4 trillion in 2006-08 as the financial crisis hit. The average household total wealth stood at £218,400 in 2010-12, up from £196,700 in 2006-08. Even after the financial crash, wealth is skewed towards the richest 10 per cent, who held 44 per cent of all wealth. By comparison the poorest 50 per cent of households owned just 9 per cent of total aggregate household wealth, the Office for National Statistics said. Overall 9 per cent of households have more than £1million, the same proportion who have less than £12,500. The gap between rich and poor also appears to be widening. In 2010-12, the wealthiest 10 per cent of households were 4.8 times wealthier than the bottom 50 per cent. The wealthiest 20 per cent of households had 105 times more than the least wealthy 20 per cent, up from 92 times more in 2008-10. Rachael Orr, Oxfam Head of UK Poverty Programme said: 'This is another shocking chapter in a tale of two Britains, further evidence of increasing inequality at a time when five rich families have the same wealth as 12 million people. 'We need our politicians to grasp the nettle and make the narrowing gap between the richest and poorest a top priority. It cannot be right that in Britain today a small elite are getting richer and richer while millions are struggling to make ends meet.' How household wealth varies across the country . Between 2006-08 and 2010-12, household wealth in London rose by 31 per cent, but it fell by 10.1 per cent in the North East . Private pensions and property each account for 38 per cent all wealth, with financial wealth making up 14 per cent and physical wealth – possessions – just 12 per cent. The value of physical wealth – including furniture, clothing and gadgets – varies widely. Around two per cent have household contents worth more than £100,000, while 52 per cent say their possesions are worth less than £30,000. There are also variations across the country. Average household wealth in the South East stood at £309,700 in 2010-12, more than double the £142,700 in the South East. The impact of the financial crash in 2007 has also been more dramatic in the north and Midlands. Between 2006-08 and 2010-12, household wealth in London rose by 31 per cent, but it fell by 10.1 per cent in the North East, and barely rose in the West Midlands (0.8 per cent) and East Midlands (0.5 per cent). Three-quarters of homes own a car and 7 per cent own a personalised numberplate . More than 1 in 10 people own a second property or land, including 3 per cent who have a second home abroad . Three-quarters of families own a car, and 4 per cent have a motorbike. Meanwhile 7 per cent have a personalised numberplate, up from 5 per cent in 2006-08. Separated men and women were the most likely to live in households with total wealth of less than £12,500 (23 per cent and 21 per cent respectively), the ONS said. Married men and women were the most likely to live in households with total wealth of £1 million or more (14 per cent and 13 per cent respectively). The ONS added: ‘Compared with single and cohabitating individuals, married individuals are on average older. ‘Knowing also that the earnings of older workers are higher than those of younger workers and that those older individuals will have had longer to accumulate wealth might go some way towards explaining these differences. ‘Compared with single individuals, those who were married might have accumulated more wealth if they were both working and in receipt of a higher joint income.’ Marries men are the group most likely to be millionaires . Separated women are most likely to live in homes with wealth of less than £12,500 . The under-35s were most likely to live in households with the lowest amounts of total wealth. In 2010-12, 13 per cent of 0-15 year olds and 14 per cent of 16-24 year olds and 25-34 year olds were living in households with a total wealth of less than £12,500. Just 4 per cent of people aged 55-64 years or over-65 lived in households in this lowest total wealth band. However, 22 per cent of all 55-64 year olds were living in households with total wealth of £1 million or more. The ONS said: ‘Individuals in this age group still find themselves in the wealth accumulation phase, and income, such as earnings from employment, enable opportunities to increase total wealth.’ There was also a small increase in the percentage of households who own an extra property is up from 10 per cent in 2008-10 to 11 per cent in 2010-12. This included 3 per cent with a second home, 4 per cent with a buy-to-let and 3 per cent who own land or property overseas.","Only 3% of millionaires have no formal qualifications new figures show .

"Anita Wainwright suffers a rare condition, cataplexy, which causes her to collapse when she has sex . A mother-of-four collapses every time she has sex due to a rare medical condition. Anita Wainwright is liable to fall to the floor whenever she experiences an orgasm, or other heightened emotions, including anger, surprise and joy. Five years ago, the now 45-year-old suddenly developed the illness cataplexy - a form of narcolepsy. She first collapsed while giggling with one of her sisters in the middle of the road. But Ms Wainwright claims the condition has now progressed to the point where she collapses after sex. That was two years ago, and since then the mother-of-four says she has avoided getting close to another partner. The condition, which was formally diagnosed this year, is an episode of muscular weakness triggered by strong emotions. The loss of muscle control can range from weakness at the knees to total collapse on the floor. Attacks can last between a few seconds and two minutes, with some sufferers experiencing repeated attacks over a 30-minute period. For Ms Wainwright, laughing with friends can trigger an attack, while she has to steer clear of her favourite tearjerker films or comedy shows, for fear of collapsing. The mother to Dale, 23, twins Laura and Leah, 21, and Dean 20, told MailOnline: 'I haven’t got a sexual partner now but around two years ago I did. 'We were having sex and I was having an orgasm when I collapsed. It was the cataplexy. 'He was understanding but I know not all men would be. 'It was really embarrassing the first time… and it kept happening. I’ve not been with anyone since.' She said her decision to remain celibate was not due to her unusual reaction to sex. But she said she is limited in what she can do and doesn’t work. 'An upsetting film, a joke – I’m on the floor,' she said. 'If I’m gassing with my sisters Maxine or Loretta, I’m then having a seizure.' Doctors initially thought her repeated collapses were due to joint problems, before brain tests revealed the much more unusual cause. Scroll down for video . The mother-of-four first suffered an attack five years ago, after laughing with her sister she collapsed in the street. The condition is triggered by any strong emotion, including anger, sadness and joy . She said: 'I never go anywhere on my own because if I see something funny and laugh, I will fall over. My sisters have to go everywhere with me. 'A lot of people don’t understand. It scares them.' She said doctors were trying her on new medicine in the hope of controlling her condition. 'I never go anywhere on my own because if I see something funny and laugh, I will fall over' - Anita Wainwright . The charity Narcolepsy UK said: 'Cataplexy is an episode of muscular weakness triggered by strong emotions such as laughter, anger and surprise. 'The loss of muscle tone ranges from a just-perceptible weakening of the facial muscles through weakness at the knees, to total collapse on the floor. 'Speech is slurred, eyesight impaired (double vision, inability to focus) but hearing and awareness remain undisturbed. Attacks often last less than two minutes, and they may only last a few seconds. 'Some people have repeated attacks of cataplexy which persist for up to 30 minutes. During both mild and severe attacks, the person stays fully conscious.'","Anita Wainwright suffers the rare medical condition cataplexy .

"Sam Allardyce has revealed all talk about his new contract will hold until the end of the season as the West Ham manager as questions remain as to whether he will remain in charge of the club. The 60-year-old is in the final year of his contract and there has been speculation that the Blackburn manager would be leaving the club, bringing to an end a four-year tenure at Upton Park. Allardyce has always struggled to win over large sections of the West Ham support, who feel his playing style does not fit with the traditions of the club. Sam Allardyce says his new West Ham contract will be sorted out at the end of the season . The West Ham boss issues instructions to his players during the 2-2 draw with Tottenham at White Hart Lane . But Allardyce will sit down with the owners when the season is over as, he says, is the usual way of doing things under owners David Sullivan and David Gold. 'The owners are no different now to what they have been in my entire time here,' Allardyce told Talksport on Friday moring. 'Waiting until the season, as they did last time when we first got back in the premier league and finished 10th, that was sorted out at the end of the season, and it will be the same for this contract.'

"Traders who were rigging the £3.5trillion-a-day foreign exchange market could face jail for their part in a scandal that has today cost five banks a record £2billion in fines. The bankers, who called themselves the 'A-Team', 'Three Musketeers' and 'The Players', colluded online by sharing sensitive information to make millions for their banks and bag big bonuses themselves. Anyone found guilty of manipulating the market could face jail and banks could face prosecution, it was warned today. The Serious Fraud Office has launched a criminal investigation - but there have been no arrests among the 30 staff sacked or suspended by banks including Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC. Evidence released for the first time today revealed traders boasted to each other about making 'free money'. Other messages reveal how the cartel feared being caught, telling eachother on forums: 'Don’t want other numpty’s in mkt to know... is he gonna protect us like we protect each other?' In a single rigged deal which made Swiss bank UBS £322,000 ($513,000) one message read: 'He's sat back in his chair, feet on desk, announcing, that's why I got the bonus pool. Made most people's year'. Punishment: Five of the world's biggest banks, including HSBC, have been fined a total of £2bn for colluding to make money from the foreign exchange market . Shameful: New evidence published by the FCA today reveals the bragging messages sent by bankers online as they rigged deals . Other message board threads read: 'How can I make free money with no f****** heads up? and later: 'cheers for saying you were same way helped me go early'. The evidence uncovered by the London-based Financial Conduct Authority led to British, US and Swiss authorities all launching an onslaught after an 18-month investigation. Regulators today revealed the latest scandal to rock the industry and handed out record fines. State-owned Royal Bank of Scotland has been fined £217million ($344million) by the London-based Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as well as £182million ($290million) by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The others involved in the settlement are Citibank, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase and UBS, who will also pay up to £500million each. Barclays said it continues to hold discussions with regulators. More than 30 traders have been fired, suspended, put on leave, or resigned since the probes started. The FCA said today that bankers, who referred to themselves as the 'A-Team' and 'Three Musketeers', colluded online by sharing information about foreign exchange orders so they could make cash for their banks and bag big bonuses themselves. The new penalties handed to their banks dwarf the fines imposed over Libor fixing. The FCA has said it issued the record fines because five banks were failing to control business practices in their foreign exchange trading operations. Barclays will be next to be punished. Shocking: One conversation between traders led to a deal that made giant UBS $513,000 and one trader joked about how a colleague bragged about his bonuses . Its penalties dwarf the £532 million imposed by the regulator on banks and City brokers over the previous big regulatory scandal involving the manipulation of the interbank lending rate, Libor. FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley said: 'Today's record fines mark the gravity of the failings we found and firms need to take responsibility for putting it right' RBS chief executive Ross McEwan said: 'To say that I am angry about the misconduct would be an understatement. 'We had people working at this bank who did not know the difference between right and wrong, or worse, didn't care about the distinction.' The FCA said traders at different banks formed tight-knit groups in which information was shared about client activity, including using code names to identify clients without naming them. Names given to these groups included 'the players', 'the 3 musketeers', '1 team, 1 dream', 'a co-operative' and 'the A-team'. Traders shared the information obtained through these groups to help them work out their trading strategies. FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley said: 'Today's record fines mark the gravity of the failings we found and firms need to take responsibility for putting it right. 'They must make sure their traders do not game the system to boost profits or leave the ethics of their conduct to compliance to worry about.' An inquiry by the Bank of England found that no official was involved in any unlawful or improper behaviour in the forex market. Wall of shame: UBS, Citibank, HSBC, RBS and JP Morgan were fined £2billion today and Barclays, bottom right, will also be fined at a later date . However one member of staff was aware that bank traders were sharing information about client orders for the purpose of 'matching' - a practice that can increase the potential for improper conduct - but did not raise the alarm to superiors. Royal Bank of Scotland was fined a total of £399million including £217million by the FCA and £182million by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). HSBC was fined £389million including £216million from the FCA and £173million from the CFTC. Swiss bank UBS was fined a total of £503million including £234million by the FCA, £182million by the CFTC and £87million by the Swiss regulator FINMA. America's Citibank was hit with penalties of £420million including just under £225.6million from the FCA and £194.6million from the CFTC. JP Morgan Chase was fined £417million including £222million by the UK regulator and £195million from the CFTC. However Barclays, the third British bank expected to be fined, said it was 'in the interests of the company to seek a more general coordinated settlement' with more investigations from other authorities still to come. The Bank of England's review, carried out by Lord Grabiner, extracted and applied search terms to 1.8 million documents and reviewed nearly 66,000 documents and 87,000 telephone calls. Chancellor George Osborne said a number of traders have been suspended or fired and the Serious Fraud Office is conducting criminal investigations. He added: 'The banks that employed them face big fines - and I will ensure that these fines are used for the wider public good. 'All of this action means the world can have confidence in the integrity of Britain's financial markets'. Authorities in America have warned several past and present UBS employees yesterday that they could face enforcement action, according to reports in the Wall Street Journal. The US Department of Justice is also involved, with JP Morgan saying that the DoJ is conducting a criminal investigation. The bank said various authorities, including the FCA, are probing its forex trading. Allegations of forex rigging form just one of a long line of scandals including Libor rate manipulation and the mis-selling of PPI loan insurance. They are likely to lead to even more calls for clawbacks from this year's bonus pools.","RBS, HSBC,  JPMorgan Chase, UBS and Citibank fined in UK and U.S.

"There are fears that e-cigarettes still carry the risks of passive smoking, a new report warns . Electronic cigarettes should be banned from indoors and face a raft of new curbs over safety fears, the World Health Organisation insisted yesterday. It claims they pose a risk to bystanders of ‘toxicant’ emissions and warns there is limited evidence they help smokers quit. A report by the organisation, which is the public health arm of the United Nations, says legal steps need to be taken to end the use of e-cigarettes in public indoor spaces and workplaces – and to ban sales to children. It recommends stopping manufacturers advertising the devices as ‘smoking cessation aids’ until they provide scientific evidence, and calls for rules against fruit, sweet or alcoholic-drink style flavours which may encourage younger smokers. Vending machines offering the products should be removed ‘in almost all locations’, the report says. It warns that e-cigarette vapour could raise background air levels of toxicants and nicotine which may not be acceptable to ‘involuntarily exposed bystanders’. WHO adds that few studies have examined whether the devices, invented in China in 2003, are effective in helping tobacco smokers to quit, though one trial found they work as well as nicotine patches. Around 2.1million Britons use battery-powered e-cigarettes, which allow users to inhale nicotine but avoid the harm caused by tobacco smoke. The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency decided they must be regulated as medicines to make them ‘safer and more effective’, but this is not due until 2016. Some experts have expressed concerns about chemicals in the liquid. The new report also recommends preventing manufacturers from marketing e-cigarettes as 'smoking cessation aids' until they provide scientific evidence to back the claim . Electronic cigarettes may be more tempting to non-smoking youths than conventional cigarettes, U.S. researchers warned yesterday. And once young people have tried e-cigarettes they are more inclined to give regular cigarettes a try. The report, released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, backs up the argument that electronic cigarettes encourage youth smoking. The study, based on youth surveys, found that more than a quarter of a million youngsters who had never smoked used an electronic cigarette in 2013. This was a threefold increase from 2011. Those who had tried e-cigarettes were nearly twice as likely to say they would try a conventional cigarette in the next year compared with those who had never tried an e-cigarette, according to the study in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research. But a major scientific review last month, which looked at 81 studies of e-cigarettes, found they caused less harm than smoking. WHO appears to have ignored appeals from experts to ‘resist the urge to control and suppress e-cigarettes’. In . an open letter in May, 53 researchers and public health specialists . warned against over-regulation, saying the devices could be a . ‘significant health innovation’ and that classifying them as tobacco . ‘will do more harm than good’. Professor . Gerry Stimson, of Imperial College London and public health campaign . group Knowledge-Action-Change, accused WHO of ‘cherry-picking’ the . science. He said it was . ‘exaggerating the risks of e-cigarettes, while downplaying the huge . potential of these non-combustible low-risk nicotine products to end the . epidemic of tobacco-related disease’. ‘WHO . claims e-cigarettes are a threat to public health, but this statement . has no evidence to support it, and ignores the large number of people . who are using them to cut down or quit smoking completely,’ he added. Action . on Smoking and Health said it could not back any plans to add . e-cigarettes to smoke-free laws. The charity’s Hazel Cheeseman said . there was ‘no evidence of any harm to bystanders’, adding: ‘Smokers who . switch to using e-cigarettes … are likely to substantially reduce their . health risks … and research suggests that they are already helping . smokers to quit.’ A . Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We have already set out our . intention to change the law to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to children . under 18.’ Professor Ann McNeill, Professor of Tobacco Addiction, National Addiction Centre, King’s College London’s Institute of Psychiatry, said: . E-cigarette use results in much lower exposure to toxins for users than regular cigarettes, says Professor McNeill (file picture) 'The e-cigarette market is rapidly evolving and research on the huge variety of products on the market, what they emit and what their health impacts are, lags behind. 'What we do know is that e-cigarettes do not emit the thousands of constituents delivered in tobacco smoke, 70 of which are known carcinogens. Instead e-cigarettes emit a vapourised solution principally of propylene glycol or glycerine, water and flavours, usually with nicotine. 'While the WHO report concludes that e-cigarettes use ’produces lower exposures to toxicants than combustible products’ I believe that this is an understatement. We can be confident that e-cigarette use results in much lower exposure to toxins for users. 'Although e-cigarette vapour may be an irritant to people in close proximity to the e-cigarette user, there is no evidence of harm from other people inhaling e-cigarette vapour unlike the known risks of second hand cigarette smoke. There is also as yet no evidence that e-cigarettes are renormalisng smoking. Based on their analysis, the WHO proposes a range of regulations for e-cigarettes and my concern is that these will deter smokers from trying to use them. Cigarette smoking is so uniquely dangerous that anything we can do to encourage smokers to stop should be welcomed.'","New report by U.N. agency raises fears over safety of electronic devices .

"Demands: Albert Buitenhuis and his wife Marthie. The couple are being forced from their home as he is too over weight . This is the man who was told he is too fat to live in New Zealand, despite losing 66lb since moving there six years ago. Albert Buitenhuis, who weighs 20 stone six pounds, was told that it may place demands on the New Zealand health services. He and wife Marthie are now facing deportation from their Christchurch home and are living with his sister in Auckland as they fight the decision. New Zealand is the third most obese nation in the developed world, coming behind the US and Mexico. Albert is five feet ten inches tall and has a body mass index of 40, making him clinically obese. But, he weighed 25 stone two pounds when he arrived in New Zealand after gaining weight when he quit smoking. His wife Marthie said that his weight had not stopped Albert from working 40 hours a week as a chef. She added that their annual visas have been approved every year since 2007 with little problem. Marthie told The Press: ‘We applied for [them] year after year and there were no issues. They never mentioned Albert's weight or his health once and he was a lot heavier then. ‘We've committed no crime and did nothing wrong other than my husband being a foodie.’ But at the start of May the couple were told they must leave as Albert’s health was no longer acceptable. Immigration New Zealand said that an applicant’s BMI must be under 35. He and his wife Marthie are now facing deportation from their Christchurch, pictured, home (Stock image) A spokesman said: ‘INZ's medical assessors have to consider to what extent there might be indications of future high-cost and high-need demand for health services.’ They claim that his weight increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease, cancer and fatty liver. He also has a knee injury which could cost up to $20,000 to replace. The Press reported that the couple’s doctor said he could bring his cholesterol and blood levels into the acceptable level within 26 weeks.

"A Florida woman accused of stabbing her boyfriend to death told police she did it because he 'put a curse on her.'

Under his spell: Amanda Lopez, 26, told police when she was arrested on Monday that she 'stabbed her ex-boyfriend because he put a curse on her' and she sought to end it . News 13 reports that Lopez told investigators she plotted to kill Fryer for over a year. Fryer was discovered with stab wounds in an apartment on Lake Trivolia Boulevard after he called 911 shortly after the assault. 'Hurry,' Fryer said breathlessly over the phone to 911. 'What's wrong,' said the 911 operator. 'I've been stabbed,' he responded with just minutes of life to spare. 'Sir, who stabbed you? said the operator before sending authorities to the bloody scene. Fryer was taken to the hospital where he later died. An autopsy report showed the Fryer had been stabbed eight times . A neighbor of Fryer's said that anything is possible--even black magic. He speculated that perhaps Lopez was really possessed by someone or maybe that she just wanted to murder someone. 'It could be anything,' said Fryers neighbor Joey Stuart. 'It could be a cover-up that she did want to murder somebody or it could be that she really was possessed by someone.' Stuart added that some people believe in demons and demonic possessions but that they can seek help for it.

"An academy in south London has banned popular slang words used by pupils in an effort to improve standards of English. No longer will words and phrases such as 'you woz', 'bare' and 'innit' be tolerated in the corridors of Harris Academy in Upper Norwood, one of 27 academies and free cchools in and around London sponsored by the Harris Federation. The school has put up signs with a list of 'banned words' - including 'extra', 'innit' and 'like', as well as beginning sentences with 'basically' or ending them with 'yeah'. Crackdown: No longer will words and phrases such as 'you woz', 'bare' and 'innit' be tolerated in the corridors of Harris Academy in Upper Norwood . Labour MP for Tottenham David Lammy defended the move, only lamenting that 'sup blood' was not included. He said: 'I think this is a very good idea. Speaking slang is fine in a social setting but a school should be a professional, educational environment and if part of that means banning slang then that’s fine by me. 'Too often I see young people going into job interviews or writing cover letters without being able to use correct English. Any attempts to change that should be encouraged. 'Not many employers would tolerate their staff using words like ""innit"" when speaking to customers or clients, so the school is right to try to discourage the use of this language in classrooms. David Lammy has reported that an academy in South London has banned some slang words, such as 'bare' and 'extra' 'Given the huge levels of youth unemployment we are experiencing under the current government, it is more important than ever that schools do what they can to prepare students for working life, and teaching good communication skills is a vital part of that. 'I think it is fairly obvious to most people that anyone who goes into a job interview with a good grasp of the English language will have an automatic advantage over someone that doesn’t. 'The issue here isn’t about slang itself, but about the context it is used in. Language is an important part of any culture, and young people will always have their own slang. 'But young people need versatility; using slang is fine in some situations, but the ability to also speak good English is absolutely crucial in any workplace, and it is something that every school should be teaching its students.'

"A new computer games controller that could be mistaken for a real gun is set for release early next year. The Delta Six controller for video games like Call of Duty looks frighteningly similar to a genuine firearm, with its inventor claiming 'the only way to get more real is to enlist'. Aimed at adult gamers, the device is intended to give players of First-Person Shooting (FPS) games a more immersive experience than has been possible so far. Scroll down for video . A bit too realistic? The Delta Six video game controller than is modelled to look like a real gun . However, the imminent release of the hyper-realistic add-on is bound to raise fears that computer games encourage violent behaviour among the young. The hybrid controller incorporates all the controls of a standard joypad in a shell modelled on military grade assault weapons. 'The only way to get more real is to enlist': U.S. soldiers in Iraq carry Armalite M16 assault rifles, similar in appearance to the Delta Six controller . With . a built-in accelerometer that its makers say can be used in any game . without calibration, it aims like a real gun without the need for a . receiver on top of the user's television set. The controller also features a range of pressure switches, one of which can automatically switch the game to precision aiming mode by simply holding the device up to the user's cheek. Other functions include a faux recoil simulation that makes it judder like it's spitting lead from the muzzle, and a real-life style reloading function in the gadget's magazine. The device ships with a range of accessories that allow users to convert it from full-length sniper rifle to compact sub-machine gun, depending on their preferred style of play. The Delta Six is the brainchild of David Kotkin, who is well known in gaming circles for his Avenger joypad mod. He . said: 'For the first time a Call of Duty player will feel more immersed . in game-play and have more control over the game than ever before. The . only way to get more real is to enlist.' Mr . Kotkin's company says preliminary testing has shown that the Delta Six . is easier and faster to use than a standard controller for FPS-style . games. Features: . The controller, which is expected to retail for $89, can be adapted to a . range of configurations depending on the user's preferred style of play . 'This wins against a reg controller, even with and Avenger adapter on it,' the inventor said. 'We're more excited about Delta Six than any other project to date. 'The Wii, and the Move tried but could not make a fun and innovative motion control for FPS games. So we had to.' However, he adds: 'This is fun for adults, not for gamers younger than 21.' The Delta Six is expected to cost $89 (£55) when it launches early next year.","'The only way to get more real is to enlist,' claims gadget's inventor .

"A registered sex offender, released from jail less than a month ago, has been arrested and charged with murder in the death of an 8-year-old Florida girl abducted while shopping with her mother on Friday night. The body of Charish Perriwinkle was found in front of Highlands Baptist Church in Jacksonville, Florida on Saturday morning after a frantic search. Donald James Smith of Jacksonville was taken into custody after police cornered his white van on Interstate 95. He had only been released from jail on May 31 . after serving 438 days on felony charges of child abuse and unlawful . impersonation of a public employee. The body of Cherish Perrywinkle was found in front of Highlands Baptist Church in Jacksonville, Florida on Saturday morning after a frantic search . Donald Smith has been arrested and charged with the abduction and murder of 8-year-old Florida girl Cherish Perrywinkle . Authorities had put out an Amber Alert with details of Smith's van early Saturday, hours after receiving a 911 call from Charish Perriwinkle's mother about the missing girl. Prior to the alleged abduction Friday night, Smith, 56, befriended Charish and her mother at a dollar store, and ‘offered to take them to Wal-Mart and buy her family some clothes,’ said Mike Williams, director of investigations at the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. ‘They appeared to be down on their luck and he could help them out.’ After spending a couple hours inside the Wal-Mart together, Smith offered to buy hamburgers and walked with Charish to the front of the store, Williams said. Charish's mom agreed to let her go with the man she had only just met whilst she . took care of her other two children and continued browsing the shelves. Instead of stopping to buy the snack, Smith walked Charish outside and the two of them got into his van, Williams said. Kidnapped then murdered: 8-year-old Cherish Perrywinkle was taken from a Jacksonville WalMart store last night by a sex offender. Less than an hour after she had gone missing her body was found in a nearby church . Shopping trip: Cherish was with her mother and two siblings at this WalMart store in Jacksonville when Donald Smith befriended her and asked if she wanted to walk with him to McDonalds . Looking for a victim: Donald Smith, 56, had only been released from jail three weeks ago. He befriended the child's mother in a dollar store and was captured on CCTV leaving Walmart with the girl . The girl's mother called 911 when she realized Charish and Smith were missing. Less than an hour later, Charish was dead. 'We located the body of Charish . Perriwinkle,' Officer Shannon Hartley said holding back tears. 'It's a . very difficult time, obviously, for everyone involved.' 'Hug your children closely right now and know where they're at,' Officer Hartley said. 'Keep them close.' Detectives say that within 30 minutes of Charish's mom realizing she had left the store with the man, police were called. An Amber Alert was issued and police searched the area with helicopters and ground units but did not find the suspect or the girl. A tip about a suspicious van spotted in the woods near a church led investigators to Charish's body Saturday morning. Meanwhile, an officer working at the scene of a traffic crash on Interstate 95 on Saturday morning recognized Smith's van as it drove past her and called it in. An officer working at the scene of a traffic crash on Interstate 95 on Saturday morning recognized Smith's van as it drove past her and called it in . Found: Cherish Lilly Perrywinkle's body was found early this morning at Highlands Church in Jacksonville, Florida . The highway was shut down while other officers pulled Smith over and arrested him. He has not cooperated with investigators, Williams said, and it was not immediately known whether he had an attorney. Williams declined to answer reporters' questions about how Charish died or what Smith did in the hours between his disappearance with the girl and his arrest, saying that the investigation remains open. Smith has been a registered sex offender since a 1993 conviction in Duval County for attempted kidnapping and selling obscene materials. Previous arrests that date as far back as 1977 when Department of Corrections records show he was convicted of indecent assault on a child under the age of 16. Prison records also show that Smith went to prison again in 1992 for attempted kidnapping. Court documents show he was convicted of that charge in addition to two counts of showing obscene material to a minor. Police gather at the Highlands Baptist Church in Jacksonville, Fla. on Saturday, June 22, 2013 where the body of 8-year-old Cherish Perrywinkle was found . Getaway vehicle: Smith was reportedly driving a 1998 white Dodge van . In 2003 prisons records show Smith served time for trafficking in stolen property and giving false information to a pawnbroker. She was also arrested in 2009 on a charge of child abuse after making obscene phone calls to a 10-year-old girl, making verbal threats, and impersonating a social worker with the Florida Department of Children and Families who claimed to be investigating the girl's family. Smith pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges in that case in 2012 and was released from jail on May 31 this year. Williams said Smith had just met with police Friday morning to comply with a state law that requires sex offenders to verify their address once a year. Smith is set to appear in court at 9 a.m. Sunday morning. Smith has been a registered sex offender since a 1993 conviction for attempted kidnapping and selling obscene materials .

"A 24-year-old snowboarder has been killed after triggering an avalanche in back country which officials had warned the public against using after a bout of violent snowstorms. Alecsander Barton, originally from Michigan, was boarding from the peak of Big Cottonwood Canyon, Utah with two friends when he triggered an avalanche that measured 700 feet wide. It occurred at a time when avalanche danger had been classified as 'high' due to heavy snowfall and loose, powdery snow. Scroll down for video . Killed: Alecsander Barton, 24, died when his snowboard triggered an avalanche which carried him 2,400 feet. He was found dead buried under three feet of snow by his two friends . Barton's two friends - a snowboarder and a skier - were not caught in the snow. They called 911 and, using beacons, found his body had been carried 2,400 feet by the snow. Barton, who was two days from his 25th birthday, was already dead. 'It sounds like they had skinned up the side of the mountain. Once they got to the peak, something happened. An avalanche was triggered,' police lieutenant Justin Hoyal told ABC News 4. 'Rescuers were flown up to the scene by Wasatch Powderbird and when they got there, the two witnesses up there - they had actually found their friend and he was deceased.' The Utah Avalanche Center added: 'His two companions switched their . avalanche transceivers to receive, descended the slope and extricated . their friend, buried under three feet of debris.' Tragic: Rescuers carry Barton's body from a Wasatch Powderbird helicopter in Salt Lake County, Utah . Shock: Barton's friends are led from the helicopter that brought all three and their rescuers out of the canyon . Although the men - who all had considerable back country experience - had been equipped with the avalanche beacons, they were still in a dangerous area, police said. Craig Gordon, Utah Avalanche Center . 'The back country conditions are extremely dangerous,' Hoyal said. 'This is a sad reminder for people to know that conditions are so extreme right now that people need to stay out of the back country.' Hours earlier, the Utah Avalanche Center had classified the danger level as 'considerable', but the rating was 'high' on the upper slopes,meaning human-triggered avalanches were 'very likely'. 'Avalanche conditions are deceptively tricky,' Craig Gordon of the Utah Avalanche Center told the Deseret News. 'You can get on some slopes and be . good to go whereas others, all you need to do is find a weak spot in the . snow pack and you're staring down the barrel of a very dangerous . avalanche.' The Utah Avalanche Center reported that the trio was on the west side of Kessler Peak, in an area known as Little Giant. Rescue team: Members of Wasatch Backcountry Rescue watch as Barton's body is taken away by medical examiners. The three men had gone to the canyon despite 'high' danger warnings on its slopes . Recovery: A split board and skis involved in the accident are taken from the helicopter, left. Medical examiners, right, take away the body of Alecsander Barton, who was an experienced back-country snowboarder . It said the peak is 'surrounded by radical terrain and avalanche paths on all sides' and that the friends had hiked to the peak along one of the paths. Barton's death is the ninth avalanche fatality in the West this season, and experts warn the risk of slides could remain high all winter. It is the second fatal avalanche of the season in the state. On November 13, professional skier Jamie Pierre, 38, was killed in a slide near Snowbird Ski Resort - just a week before it was due to open. Barton and Pierre were both killed after new, heavy snowfall led to avalanche warnings. Experts say a weak base layer of snow, packed with large grains of ice, is causing trouble across Utah, Colorado, Montana and California. They predict such conditions could keep avalanche risks high for the rest of the season.

"Suspended: Revoe Primary School headteacher Catherine Woodall (pictured) has been suspended amid allegations over the care of pupils . A headmistress and five staff have been suspended after a pupil who went ‘berserk’ was locked in a room to calm down. The teachers placed the nine-year-old boy in the ‘time out’ room after he terrorised staff and pupils at his primary school. When he got home he told his parents and they called the police, complaining of false imprisonment. Officers started an investigation and six staff members, including the headmistress Catherine Woodall, 61, have been suspended from their jobs and questioned by detectives. The police inquiry will also examine claims other children had been ‘locked’ in the room when they misbehaved. Last night parents and teachers reacted angrily to the suspensions. ‘This child went completely berserk and was likely to cause injury,’ said one member of staff. 'If he had injured anyone then the brickbats would have been out and questions would have been asked over why they had not put him in a secure room. It’s not good enough. 'Teachers are afforded no protection from violence and when they are assertive and use common sense this happens.’ The incident happened shortly before half-term at the 442-pupil Revoe Community Primary School in Blackpool. The school has a special education unit which deals with children with behavioural problems from across the borough. It is understood the boy had been referred there from another school. He is said to have been arguing with staff over a minor incident in the classroom before losing his temper. He was restrained in a corridor before being placed in the ‘time out’ room. Once in the soundproofed room, staff were able to monitor him through the window. Selina Lapworth, 28, a mother of four, said parents wanted to know more about why the teachers had been suspended. ‘Every school has naughty children and there are a few here but the teachers always seem to deal with it quite well,’ she said. Scroll down for video . Incident: Six staff including the head at Revoe Primary School in Blackpool have been suspended after a boy, nine, was disciplined . ‘It seems pretty heavy handed that she (the head) has been suspended and we’d like to know the reasons.’ The headmistress is understood to have . been off sick on the day of the incident but was questioned as she has . overall responsibility for decisions taken in the school. Under education guidelines pupils with challenging behaviour should not be left locked up alone and unsupervised in such rooms. Last night, at her home near Chorley, . Mrs Woodall said: ‘I have been suspended. I have received a telephone . call from the education authority threatening me that if I speak to . anyone I will be disciplined, which is a bit ironic. So I am not willing . to speak to anyone.’ Two heads from other primary schools . in the town have been drafted in to manage Revoe, which was recently . given a glowing Ofsted report. Parent Emma Chadwick, 28, said it was . time for an inquiry into the disciplinary methods of the school. She . claimed her seven-year-old son was put in the ‘cupboard room’ for . misbehaving last year. ‘It is disgusting that children can be treated in . this way when they are at school,’ she said. A police spokesman said: ‘This . allegation, like any allegation involving the well-being of young . people, is being taken extremely seriously and will be thoroughly . investigated.’ Parents: Emma Chadwick (left), 28, said her son Harley Marsh (also left), 7, who is a pupil at the Revoe Primary School, was also put in 'the cupboard'. He was not the nine-year-old child restrained in the cupboard. Felicity Crane, 32, is pictured (right) with her sons Orson, Ray and Theo, who are also pupils at the school .

"Five primary schools in England don’t have a single pupil whose mother tongue is English. There are also 240 schools where at least 90 per cent of children grew up learning another language. Earlier this year, it was claimed that Gladstone Primary School in Peterborough was the only one without a single native English speaker, but four more have been found in figures obtained by Sky News. 'Bilingual world': Christine Parker, head of Gladstone Primary School, with some of her pupils . Two schools, including Gladstone Primary, each had more than 400 pupils speaking a bewildering 20 languages. Education experts yesterday said the influx of immigrant children often had a positive influence on British-born pupils because of their strong work ethic. But they warned teachers risked being swamped. Professor Alan Smithers, an education expert at the University of Buckingham, said: ‘It is a growing phenomenon because of the large scale of immigration, which is putting a great deal of pressure on our school system.’ Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘Immigrant children bring a good work ethic to schools. The problem is they will have an impact on children who do speak English as a first  language because teachers’ time will be taken up helping them. ‘It can be up to a year before these children speak good English. But the other pupils don’t get that time back.’ The figures, from the Department for Education for the 2012-2013  academic year, showed Gladstone Primary had 441 pupils speaking languages including Punjabi, Urdu, Portuguese, Czech, Polish, and several Russian dialects. Teachers help pupils learn English by explaining everything they are doing so that children associate objects and actions with words. Headteacher Christine Parker was not available for comment yesterday but has said: ‘More and more of the world is going bilingual. The culture at our school is not to see bilingualism as a difficulty.’ Peterborough City Council receives an extra £1.5million a year from the Department for Education to cover the cost of teaching children English. Schools where 90 per cent of children speak English as a second language include nearby Beeches Primary, where 23 languages were spoken by 592 pupils. Sacred Heart School in Tipton, West Midlands, has 128 pupils, mostly with parents from Pakistan and Bangladesh. Headteacher Melanie Gee said: ‘Within a couple of weeks they are communicating in English.’ Ofsted inspections over the past six years showed one school had been rated ‘outstanding’ and two had maintained ‘good’ ratings in consecutive inspections. Gladstone went from ‘inadequate’ to ‘good’. Westwood School in Oldham slipped from ‘good’ to ‘satisfactory’ between 2009 and last year, but 83 per cent of pupils reached required levels in English Key Stage 2 tests and 87 per cent in maths. The figures at Gladstone were 74 per cent and 72 per cent respectively. A DfE spokesman said: ‘Many schools successfully teach pupils whose first language is not English.’","Government figures reveal the five schools with no native English speakers .

"Australian Zaky Mallah, the first person charged with terrorism in Australia, is hoping to be signed up to fight with a Ukrainian military unit which is recruiting Australians. The Asov Battalion - which Sydney man Mr Mallah, who was jailed in maximum security for two years before being acquitted of terrorism charges, has applied to join - has set up a Facebook page in its recruitment drive for men to join for a minimum two months. The battalion describes itself as a military wing of the Ukrainian Government and is open to 'all foreign volunteers' to join a revolution . 'This is a revolution for idealists... You will get over here and will find only problems, war, adventure, maybe death, serious wounds, but for sure also great memories and friends for a lifetime,' the revolution's call to arms poster reads. Scroll down for video . Australian man Zaky Mallah, 30 (pictured in his western Sydney apartment with the flag of moderate Syrian rebel group, the Islamic Front) travelled to Syria in 2012 and went on the frontline with the Free Syrian Army. Now he has applied to go to Kiev and join the Ukrianian group, the Asov Battalion to fight the Russians . Join the revolution: Zaky Mallah was sent this recruitment poster and a Facebook letter asking for foreign volunteers to go to Kiev and fight with a Ukrainian Battalion against Russian forces on the Black Sea . Zaky Mallah is pictured with a firearm on his tour to Syria in 2012, where he met with troops of the Free Syrian Army on the frontline, but 'did not engage in any hostile acts' Asov Revolution's Vadim, 34, the battalion's deputy commander who goes by the nom-de-guerre 'the Trojan' and does not identify himself for security reasons, is pictured readying fotrifications for volnuteers and troops to fight in the Mariupol area . Zaky Mallah said he is 'just waiting' for the Ukrainian battalion group Asov to contact him after he applied to join up and fight the Russians in a region on the Black Sea . All volunteers have to do is get themselves to the Ukrainian capital of Kiev and prepare to become a fighter, a combat trainer or an interpreter. 'Just get there and they will take care of you,' the Asov Revolution page says. 'Sleeping, eating, basic training at our Kyiv [Kiev] military base, etc until you are fit enough and are ready to be sent to our base in the southeast of Ukraine and join the fight.' Zaky Mallah, 30, from Westmead in western Sydney, has already applied and even though he speaks no Russian or Ukrainian is hoping to qualify with his experience of travelling to the front line in Syria in late 2012 with the Free Syrian Army (FSA). Ukrainian soldiers fight in the Donetsk region this week in the south of Ukraine near the Russian border . In 2003, Mallah, a Lebanese Australian, was charged under Australia's then new anti-terrorism laws after he made a video which Federal Police and ASIO said contained a planned suicide attack on Federal Government offices in Sydney. He spent two years in the high maximum security Multi Purpose Unit at Goulburn prison awaiting trial, before being acquitted. It was only in 2009 that he was able to obtain an Australian passport. Two years ago Mr Mallah travelled to Syria and lived with the FSA rebels engaged in the bloody civil war against Muslim hardliner President Bashar el Assad 'before it got crazy over there'. After returning home, he encouraged young people to go to Syria and engage in jihad to experience the freedom fight taken up against El Assad, but since the rise of ISIS and al Nusra he has changed his mind. The Asov Revolution group (pictured, training volunteers this week in Mariupol) says an 'international unit is now under construction in the Mariupol region' on the Black Sea for the battalion which was a division of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs . It asks applicants to list their military experience, motivation and family and work commitments, and stresses 'that this is a volunteer unit. Nobody is getting paid, including the Ukrainians. We have a very limited budget' Two years ago Zaky Mallah travelled to Syria and lived with the FSA rebels engaged in the bloody civil war against Muslim hardliner President Bashar el Assad 'before it got crazy over there' He now describes the extremist group which has taken over the rebel fight in Syria as 'a barbaric cult' and criticises the friend he knew as a teenager, Khaled Sharrouf, for joining ISIS. 'He is full of hate and he is involved in a massive propaganda war with a group that is intent on starting a new Islamic state,' Mr Mallah told Daily Mail Australia. 'But I don't believe he's anywhere near the front line or fighting. Those pictures with the severed heads are propaganda photos and Australians who have joined ISIS are both arrogant and ignorant. 'If the [el Assad] regime ends in Syria there will be a mess, massive in-fighting between the rebel groups.' He said if he were to return to Syria, he would fight for the moderate group, the Islamic Front, whose flag hangs on the wall in his Sydney apartment. While Mr Mallah admits he is looking to join the Asov Revolution in Ukraine partly because the Valdimir Putin-backed Russian rebels are also supporters of the al Assad regime in Syria, he says the Ukrianian group is fighting a legitimate battle to retain its territory for its people. 'It's a revolution and I'd like to join in and kick some Russian a**e, but I want to contribute something useful and go to the front line and help with providing food, cleaning military or humanitarian aid, doing security checks, whatever is required.'

Mr Mallah admits he is looking to join the Asov Revolution in Ukraine partly because the Valdimir Putin-backed Russian rebels are also supporters of the al Assad regime in Syria, he says the Ukrianian group is fighting a legitimate battle to retain its territory for its people .

'Just get there and they will take care of you,' the Asov Revolution page says . Mr Mallah said the Australian Government's laws under the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act which precluded its citizens engaging in 'hostile' acts in foreign countries would not apply to him because he did not intend to engage in actual war. He said before he left he would meet with ASIO or Federal authorities who had delayed in 2012 trip to Syria.

'So basically you need to get to Kyiv when we give you the green light. You will be provided with a telephone number, an e-mail address, and a name of an English speaking person from the Social-National Assembly (SNA), a political branch of Azov battalion. 'Remember that we are the military wing of SNA ... we are Socialist, Nationalist and Radical. 'We do have strong ideas about the future of Ukraine and Europe.

"A teenager has been suspended from school after teachers mistook her non-alcoholic shandy for a bottle of lager. Nikita Morrison, 13, was in a French lesson when she put the bottle of Ben Shaw’s Bitter Shandy on her desk while unpacking her school books. But teachers immediately confiscated the 500ml drink and within minutes she was sent home after being excluded for three days. Controversy: Nikita Morrison, 13, who has been suspended from Gloucester Academy for bringing in the drink . She claims staff at Gloucester Academy considered the soft drink to be alcohol - despite the product’s website stating it is suitable for children. The alcohol content of the drink is less than 0.5 per cent - not enough to legally qualify as an intoxicating liquor and it is sold in the soft drinks aisle in shops. Ms Morrison, who has never been excluded before, said: ‘I couldn’t believe it. ‘You see kids at school drinking it all the time, even the Year 7s, there is nothing wrong with it. ‘The teachers told me I wasn’t allowed to bring it into school because it is lager. I told them it was pop but they just wouldn’t listen.’ Anger: Nikita's mother, Amanda (right), has described her suspension as 'absurd' and complained that she is now behind with her lessons . Ben Shaw’s Bitter Shandy contains 12 per cent beer but is sold in the soft drink aisle in shops. No ID is needed to buy it and it is officially classed as a soft drink by the UK Food Standards Agency. Her mother Amanda, 38, said the incident on Wednesday was ‘absolutely ludicrous’. ‘It is absurd, the staff were saying it was alcohol. ‘She has missed quite a few lessons now, it is ridiculous. She is special needs so she is dropping behind even more. Safe: The shandy that Ms Morrison brought into school contains less than 0.5 per cent alcohol and is sold in the soft drinks sections of shops . ‘It find it absolutely ludicrous that she is missing out on education because of a bottle of pop. ‘Despite the fact we have explained, and proven, that it is not alcohol the school won’t listen at all.’ The stay-at-home mum-of-nine added: ‘There is nothing wrong with taking that drink into school at all. ‘I tried to explain that it was my mistake and I bought it from the supermarket but that was not good enough.’ Alan Armstrong, interim headteacher at Gloucester Academy, defended the exclusion. He said: ‘This school and all schools never exclude a student lightly or for trivial reasons. Schools have a duty of care to ensure all students are kept safe.’ A Ben Shaw’s spokesman said: ‘Shandies with less than 0.5 per cent alcohol by volume are defined as soft drinks and as such have no restriction on their sale or consumption. ‘All products we manufacture under the shandy name are less than 0.5 per cent and this is stated on labelling.’","Nikita Morrison, 13, brought Ben Shaw's Bitter Shandy to a classroom .

"When cage fighter Rob Harris felt something bite his leg on holiday he thought it was nothing more than a mosquito. The now 32-year-old and his girlfriend Tina Higginson were in Cancun, Mexico, having celebrated a friend's wedding last February. It was only when the couple spotted a spider crawling on the floor, near the bed, they realised the situation could be more serious. Within hours, Mr Harris' lower right leg had inflated to twice its size, as poison surged through his veins. Scroll down for video . While on holiday in Cancun, Mexico, Rob Harris (pictured with his girlfriend Vicky Higginson) was bitten by a Brown Recluse spider, leaving him with a hole in his leg and bed-bound for weeks recovering . Mr Harris said the bite felt like a mosquito bite, but within hours, his lower right leg started to swell up. The area around the bite became red and inflamed, and was hot to touch, he told MailOnline . He had been bitten by a Brown Recluse spider - a small arachnid with a potent, venomous bite. The bite was start of a month-long ordeal which left him with three holes in his leg, oozing pus. 'It didn't really hurt to start with,' Mr Harris told MailOnline. 'We weren't sure what it was to start with, it felt a bit like a bug bite. 'I . was in bed. It wasn't even a very big spider, I just flicked . something off my leg and only later realised it was a spider. 'I started to react really quickly. Within hours my knee had ballooned. It didn't half kick in quick. 'My leg just kept growing, like it had been inflated with a pump. 'It got to the point when you couldn't even see my knee cap.' Refusing to see a doctor, it was Miss Higginson who insisted her boyfriend be seen by a medic. The 27-year-old, told MailOnline:  'It was pretty scary. When it first happened we just thought it was a mosquito bite. 'It wasn't until we saw the spider than we realised what had happened. 'Rob was refusing to call the doctor, but as it started to swell I just decided to call the resort doctor. 'As soon as they said the word ""hospital"" to us, I was terrified. You automatically assume the worst.' Mr Harris said he started to worry about the cost of treatment aboard, despite the couple having travel insurance. 'We . had heard horror stories about hospital stays on our trip, and while we . had insurance you often have to pay thousands up front,' he said. 'We were at the end of our two week holiday, it had been pretty pricey. Mr Harris was bitten by a Brown Recluse spider, a small spider often measuring six to 20mm, with a powerful, venomous bite . The couple were due to fly home the next morning, but instead found themselves in hospital where doctors prescribed Mr Harris anti-biotics to try and treat the bite . The brown recluse spider is a small arachnid, measuring between six and 20mm, with a venomous bite. The species often live between one and two years. Each female produces several egg sacs over a period of two to three months from May to July, with around 50 eggs in each. The eggs hatch over the course of a month. The spiderlings take about a year to grow to adulthood. The speicies is resilient and can withstand up to six months of extreme drought and scarcity or absense of food. They are found roughly south of a line from southeastern Nebraska through southern Iowa, Illinois, Indiana to southwestern Ohio. The species is rarely aggressive, and bites are uncommon. The spider ususally only bites when pressed against the skin, when tangled in clothes, towels, bedding, etc. The bite is often not immediately painful but can be dangerous. The species bears the potentially deadly hemotoxic venom. Most bites are minor but in more severe cases the venom spreads throughout the body and can form a necrotising ulcer that destroys soft tissue and may take months to heal, leaving deep scars. 'By the time we got to hospital my knee had started to blow up really bad. 'Doctors told me I wasn't allowed to fly and had to wait another day and a half before we were allowed to head home.' But when the couple arrived home to Harlow, Essex, Mr Harris' recovery did not go according to plan. While in most cases a bite from a Brown Recluse Spider is minor, Mr Harris was one of the unlucky ones. He suffered what is known as a necrotising ulcer, where the poison eats away at the flesh around the site of the bite. He told MailOnline: 'It was horrible. The poison must've really got in there. 'There was a hole in my leg so big you could stick a cotton bud in it.' He waited for a while to see if the medication he had been given would start to work. But a week later and still taking antibiotics, the treatment 'just wasn't doing anything', Mr Harris told MailOnline. 'My leg was hot, like it was burning, he said. 'I could see it was turning into an open wound. 'I squeezed it and what came out was the most disgusting thing I have seen. It was pouring out of my leg, it was horrible. With . pus streaming down his leg, Mr Harris was admitted to hospital, where . doctors prescribed more antibiotics to try and stem the spread of the . infection. He said: 'Tina . took me back to hospital, they informed my that the venom was eating . away at my skin which was preventing the wound from healing. Mr Harris, told MailOnline: 'I started to react really quickly. Within hours my knee had ballooned. It didn't half kick in quick. My leg just kept growing, like it had been inflated with a pump' When the couple arrived back to their home in Harlow, Essex, Mr Harris' recovery did not go according to plan. He started to notice pus oozing from the bite, which had become an open wound. After visiting hospital at home, it took around a month before the cage fighter was back on his feet . 'Long story short, I was in agony, hot and cold sweats, constant headaches and vomiting. 'I physically couldn't walk and was bed bound for weeks. 'Tina had to help me to the bathroom where I couldn't stand and I had to take a month of work. I was left with three huge holes in my knee, you could see all the way down to the bone where the spider venom had eaten away at my flesh.' It was around a month later before the cage fighter and owner of TIW Combat Academy, was fully recovered. He said the ordeal has only heightened his fear of spiders and bugs. He told MailOnline: 'I hate all bugs, I don't like them full stop. 'Anything with more than four legs and I'm not really interested, even less so now. 'It took over a month for my skin to start growing back, I'm left with a huge scar and a large bald patch on my knee where's its scared tissue the hair wont grow back.' His girlfriend of four years, Miss Higginson, 27, said it was 'terrifying' watching her partner suffering. She said: 'Hospitals abroad are already more scary, we couldn't really understand whether they were telling us Rob was fine or he was on death's door. 'They could've been saying anything to us.'","Rob Harris was bitten by a Brown Recluse spider while in Cancun, Mexico .

"A word of warning to those who write personal notes to Pope Francis: He might just call you back. Francis has already charmed the masses with his informal style, simplicity and sense of humour. But a handful of strangers have gotten the treatment up close, receiving papal phone calls out of the blue after writing him or suffering some personal tragedy. So the Catholic faithful are being warned: Be ready, especially if the landline rings. Down to earth: Pope Francis has been surprising Catholics who write to them by personally calling them back . The 76-year-old Francis has a fondness for making calls the old-fashioned way, using land lines and placing the calls himself, often surprising recipients by simply announcing: 'It's the pope.' After his election in March, Francis reportedly called his newspaper stand in Buenos Aires to cancel his daily delivery and his shoemaker to tell him not to bother with papal red leather loafers but to keep making his regular black orthotics. The receptionist at the Jesuit headquarters in Rome thought he got a crank call when Francis phoned two days after being chosen pope looking for the Jesuit superior. Francis has since called an Italian . man whose brother was killed and a Colombian woman who works in Rome to . thank her for a book. After another random phone call from . the pope this week, Italy's leading Corriere della Sera daily offered . etiquette tips for the lucky recipients, proposing conversation starters . and no-go areas on its front page Friday. Stefano Cabizza, 19, from Padua, was the recipient of this week's papal phonecall after he left a letter for Francis at a Mass he attended . Beppe Severgnini, a noted humorist and Corriere columnist, suggested: . Severgnini also said even though Francis is fond of using the informal 'tu' in conversation, stick with the formal 'lei' but don't overdo it with exaggerated titles like 'magnificent.' The recipient of this week's call, a 19-year-old student Stefano Cabizza, was quoted by Corriere as saying that Francis had told him to refer to him with the informal 'tu,' noting that 'Even Jesus and the apostles used the ""tu"".' Mr Cabizza said he received the call after leaving a letter for Francis following his Mass at Castel Gandolfo on August 15. He declined to say what he had written. Finally, Severgnini advised people not to be worried about what to say. 'Just be natural,' he wrote. 'If he wanted to get bored, he would have called a government minister.'","Catholics in Italy shocked to answer the phone and hear: 'Hi, it's the Pope'
Listen first, then talk, and if the conversation permits, ask the soccer-mad Francis about the recent friendly between Italy and Argentina.
Always ask how Benedict XVI is doing. 'It'll make him happy,' Severgnini noted. Francis frequently refers fondly to his 86-year-old retired predecessor who is living on the other side of the Vatican gardens.
Avoid touchy subjects like Vatican policy or scandal.

On Wednesday the preening figure of Cristiano Ronaldo will arrive at Anfield wearing the colours of European champions Real Madrid. If Liverpool are to emerge unscathed from a clash against Carlo Ancelotti’s team, they will need to buck up their ideas. Here at Loftus Road Brendan Rodgers was brutal in his assessment after Liverpool recorded one of the flukiest victories in the history of the Barclays Premier League. VIDEO Scroll down to watch... Raheem Sterling (second right) crosses the ball which Steven Caulker (centre) tries to intercept but turns into his own net .

Caulker shows his anger at scoring an own goal and what proved to be the winner for Liverpool . Raheem Sterling and Steven Gerrard celebrate after the former's cross was turned into the QPR net by Caulker . Four goals were scored in the final seven minutes as the game swung back and forth. Here's how the drama unfolded: . 86 mins - Liverpool lead 1-0 after an earlier Richard Dunne own goal . 87 - Eduardo Vargas scores to make 1-1 . 90 - Philippe Coutinho makes it 2-1 Liverpool . 92 - Vargas heads in to make it 2-2 . 95 - Steven Caulker own goal makes it 3-2 . QPR are entitled to feel rotten. ‘It was fortunate, we were nowhere near our capacity and it has been like that for much of the season,’ he admitted. This was a day when Liverpool got lucky, winning when they should probably have been beaten by Harry Redknapp’s hardworking Rangers team. For good measure Steven Gerrard, the captain of this Liverpool team, clobbered his team-mates. ‘Everything needs improving,’ he added and it is impossible to disagree. It certainly takes some explaining how four goals were scored in the final seven minutes of this extraordinary fixture. Liverpool relied on two own goals, some calamitous defending and the ultra-generous timekeeping of referee Phil Dowd to string together their second successive victory. ‘The win moves us up to fifth,’ added Rodgers, but the way Liverpool have been playing of late, it needed checking just to be sure. Rangers hit the woodwork twice in the first half through Leroy Fer and Liverpool were there for the taking. They really were.

RATINGS BY SAMI MOKBEL . They have lost their pizzazz and the aura has gone after Luis Suarez hot-footed it to Barcelona for £75million in the summer. Instead they have Mario Balotelli, one of the most disengaged footballers that English football has ever had the misfortune to be associated with. He does Liverpool no favours. It can only be a matter of time before one of his team-mates really gets tucked into him if he continues to play as half-baked as this. Missing a couple of sitters from close range is just about acceptable for one of the world’s leading forwards if you’re putting in a shift. Balotelli doesn’t seem bothered. Back to the goals, because hours of fun will be had with the Liverpool players in the video analysis room before Real Madrid arrive for their Champions League clash. They went ahead when Richard Dunne extended his record of own goals in the Premier League to 10 after awkwardly hooking Glen Johnson’s right-wing cross beyond Alex McCarthy. Just over 10 minutes later England’s head coach Roy Hodgson, who failed to make any attempt to communicate with Rodgers over Raheem Sterling, had seen enough. By the time he arrived back at his new home in fashionable Chelsea and put the kettle on, four more goals had been scored. Quite bewildering. Redknapp had sent for Eduardo Vargas, who scored twice for Chile in a friendly against Peru last week, to come off the substitutes’ bench. His first goal for Rangers was scored in the 90th minute when he read Charlie Austin’s knockdown and rippled the back of Simon Mignolet’s net with a tidy finish. That made it one-apiece and if Dowd had whistled there and then, everybody associated with both  teams would have gone home happy. It didn't work out that way. Instead Liverpool raced up the other end and Philippe Coutinho, another substitute, sent a low, angled drive beyond Rangers keeper McCarthy. It was a beaut. At times like this, for a team with the ambitions of Liverpool and plenty of experience, they should be home and hosed. Instead, they were pegged back again. Martin Skrtel and Dejan Lovren, stationed in the heart of Liverpool’s defence, couldn’t live with the darting runs of Vargas.

He scored again with 92 minutes on the clock, prompting QPR chairman Tony Fernandes to celebrate in the gangways of their director’s box. Everybody was getting a hug. Then the sickener as Sterling, decent without being at his spell-binding best, struck gold when his cross was met by the foot of Steven Caulker. An entire stadium collectively screamed ‘no’, but his leg was already extending and he guided the ball beyond the Rangers keeper to give Liverpool this improbable victory. They nicked this. Redknapp knew it, arriving for his post-match duties with a face like thunder after Rangers bizarrely sent the troops into Mignolet’s penalty area for Fer’s free-kick when the score was 2-2. ‘What were they doing?’ asked Redknapp and it wasn’t the moment to break the silence. ‘They thought we could win it,’ he added in exasperation. QPR are doing their best to go straight back down, to undo all the good work after they were promoted from the Championship on that barmy day at Wembley when Bobby Zamora got their winner against Derby. Harry is hanging on. He had coffee with Fernandes on Friday night, paying the bill after their 20 minute chat left him in no doubt that Rangers must start to improve. Quickly. ‘Looking at the list of names mentioned for the job there’s no-one better than me to manage this team,’ declared Redknapp. He is a wounded man, upset that his managerial integrity has been questioned after a sticky run in the opening weeks of the Premier League season. After his, he will wonder whether his luck really has run out. Hodgson enjoys a joke with QPR head of football operations Les Ferdinand (left) before kick-off .

"An undated family handout picture  shows 16-year-old Mohammed Abu Khder, a Palestinian teenager whose body was found today in Jerusalem's forest area . Violence has broken out in East Jerusalem as protesters clash with police following the murder of a Palestinian teenager in a suspected revenge attack for the death of three Israeli schoolboys. Young Palestinian men threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers in both the Israeli capital and the West Bank city of Jenin, as special forces were sent to quell anger over the death of Mohammed Abu Khdair. Officers discovered the charred and beaten body of the young Palestinian in woodland this morning, following reports of a person being forced into a car outside a supermarket near Shuafat. The grim . discovery came just hours after angry protests broke out over the murder . of the three Jewish teens in the West Bank, during which some . reportedly shouted 'death to the Arabs'. Officers . are investigating a possible connection between the murder and the . reported kidnapping of Mohammed Abu Khdair in East Jerusalem earlier the . same morning, a police spokesman said. The . incident occurred the day after Israel buried three teenagers who had . been kidnapped near a Jewish settlement on June 12 and whose bodies were . found in the West Bank on Monday. Palestinian residents said they saw a teenager being forced into a vehicle outside the supermarket. Micky . Rosenfeld, a spokesman for Israeli police, said police had been . notified of a youth 'pulled into a vehicle and possibly kidnapped' and . roadblocks were set up in search of suspects.' Later . 'police discovered a body in the Jerusalem forest and were looking to . see if there was a connection between the missing youth and the body . that was found,' Rosenfeld said. A security source speaking on condition . of anonymity said Israel suspected Mohammed Abu Khdair had been kidnapped and . killed, possibly in retribution for the killings of the Israeli teens. Amid heightened tensions following the discovery of the Palestinian teenager's body, violent protests broke out in East Jerusalem's Shuafat refugee camp. Video . footage posted online appears to show protesters throwing rocks at . Israeli police, as special forces were sent in and roads closed around . the area. Despite calls for calm, Gaza militants were said by Israel to have fired a barrage of eight rockets towards . southern Israel late last night, with around 20 rockets and mortars fired . throughout the day. It was also claimed that anti-rocket defences had intercepted two rockets, although there were no reports of casualties or damage. The . army said it carried out one airstrike on a mortar-launching site in . Gaza, scoring a 'direct hit', and the heavy barrage late last night raised . the likelihood of further Israeli reprisals. Early Thursday, a . rocket fired from Gaza slammed into a house in the southern Israeli . border town of Sderot, causing heavy damage to the structure and a . nearby road and knocking out electricity throughout town, according to the Israeli army. The family was huddled inside a shelter, and no one was hurt. In response to the latest rocket barrage, the Israeli military . said the air force carried out a 'precision strike' on 15 Hamas targets . in Gaza overnight, including concealed rocket launchers, . weapon-storage facilities and 'terror activity' sites.

"A 32-year-old middle school teacher has been accused of raping a 13-year-old boy after he accepted a 'dare' to contact her and visit her home. Mary Faith McCormick, a married mother-of-one, was arrested after one of the boy's friends allegedly found semi-nude photos of the teacher on the boy's phone. Police then carried out an investigation and allegedly uncovered the three-month affair between the teacher and the underage boy. The sixth grade teacher at Siloam Springs Intermediate School in Benton County, Arkansas, is also accused of sending the boy sexually explicit text messages and photos, KFSM reported. Arrest: Married school teacher Mary Faith McCormick, pictured left in her mug shot and right, stands accused of having sex with a 13-year-old student. She also allegedly sent him explicit text messages and photos . According to a probable cause affidavit the two had consensual sex at least twice. The sexual encounters began after a friend 'dared' the 13-year-old to contact McCormick. The report said the teen and a friend went over to the teacher's apartment to watch a movie. When the friend left, the boy remained behind and later had sex with the teacher in her bedroom, the affidavit states. Police said the teacher and the teen sent each other 'snap chat' messages of each other's genitalia. They also exchanged explicit text messages. Investigators said they had collected electronic messages between the pair. Two USB thumb drives, an iPad and two Apple iphones and desktop computer were seized from McCormick's home. Married: McCormick, who is pictured with her husband, allegedly had sex with the boy at her home . Caught: Another student, aged just 12, found a photo of the teacher wearing just a towel on the boy's phone . Police launched their investigation after a 12-year-old girl friend of the boy borrowed his cell phone and discovered one of the messages which showed the teacher in nothing but a towel, according to KFSM 5 News. Further examination of the iPhone revealed a photo of McCormick topless. The affidavit says an eye witness saw several inappropriate messages and photos, including one with McCormick with wet hair and showing off her breasts. The text with the risque photo said: 'I'm not dirty anymore.' McCormick's Facebook page shows she has a husband and a young daughter and reveals her father is a teacher in the same school district. Workplace: She is a sixth grade language arts teacher at Siloam Springs Middle School in Arkansas, pictured, but she has been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation . School superintendent said McCormick was suspended on full pay. She was held overnight in Benton County Jail before being released on Thursday on $50,000 bail. The probable cause affidavit said the two had consensual sex at least twice between June and August. Under Arkansas law, 'consensual' sex between an adult and an underage minor is considered rape because the minor cannot legally consent. Her next court date is in September.","Mary Faith McCormick, a sixth grade teacher in Arkansas, 'had sex with the boy at least twice after he visited her home to watch a movie'

"The cities with the highest rate of same-sex couples raising children in the U.S. today have been revealed - and they're probably where you least expected. Salt Lake City has been named the leading metropolitan area for same-sex couples raising children according to a report out of UCLA that identified one out of every four couples having at least one child. Perhaps more shocking, the figures presented by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law this week found that the majority of same-sex parents are raising their children in more conservative areas of the country. Ranking: Salt Lake City has been named the largest metro area for same-sex couples in the country having 26 percent, with Grand Forks, North Dakota showing 65 percent among smaller areas . State capital: Salt Lake City is perhaps more widely known as the home to the headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whose golden statue of the Angel Moroni is seen . The highest rates are in fact seen in . states with constitutional bans on gay marriage - Mississippi having the . largest rate among all states with 26 percent. The smaller cities in the country, with populations less than 1 million, had the highest rates among them all with 65 percent of same-sex couples in Grand Forks North Dakota/Minnesota said to be raising children. 'Parenting among same-sex couples is more common in socially conservative parts of the county,' Gary J. Gates, the researcher behind the study, told MSN News. 'I wasn’t necessarily expecting Salt Lake City to top the list,' he continued, 'but I did expect that metro areas like San Francisco and New York, with their more LGBT supportive social and legal climates, would have relatively lower proportions of same-sex couples raising children.' New York and Los Angeles were both . still found having more same-sex couples with children in comparison to . others, but their ratio was substantially lower.

'It doesn’t matter if you’re gay or straight, you still want that.' Clark University Associate Professor of Psychology Abbie Goldberg agrees. 'When you ask, ""Why are you living here?"" they almost always say family,' Goldberg, who has studied gay and lesbian parents in rural areas, told the LA Times. 'It shouldn't really be surprising.

"A toddler whose head swelled to three times its normal size is smiling for the first time after surgery to reduce the circumference from 37 to 23 inches. Three-year-old Roona Begum was rushed to hospital in New Delhi, India, last year, suffering an extreme form of hydrocephalus - water on the brain. Surgeons carried out a series of operations to reduce the size of Roona's head, but she was discharged home, her parents warned she had little chance of survival. But this week medics were shocked to find that not only is Roona alive, she is starting to smile and laugh. Scroll down for video . Three-year-old Roona Begum was rushed to hospital lin New Delhi, India, last year, suffering an extreme form of hydrocephalus - water on the brain. The condition caused her head to swell to three times its normal size . But the toddler has amazed doctors, who warned her mother Fatima, pictured, and father Abdul she wouldn't survive. After a series of surgeries to reduce the circumference of her head from 37 to 23 inches, Roona is smiling and laughing for the first time . 'The doctors said she would not live - but she has survived,' said Roona's mother Fatima Khatun, 23. 'She is much better now. She can hold her head straight and she can move her head from side to side on her own. She responds to other kids and she will smile if other kids call out her name.' She added: 'I would be very happy if she could stand and talk and be like a normal child. We hope she will one day go to school.' The youngster, whose head circumference was reduced from 37ins to 23ins through major surgeries last year, cannot yet walk because of the weight of her head. But she is able to crawl, eat, sleep and interact with her parents with much more comfort at their home in Tripura, western India. The family's new hope comes more than a year after Roona was admitted to the Fortis Memorial Research Institute and Hospital in Gurgaon, on the outskirts of New Delhi, in April 2013. Facing a huge medical bill, the couple were overwhelmed when images showing Roona's plight attracted international sympathy and prompted the hospital to treat her rare condition for free. Touched by Roona's plight the Fortis Memorial Research Institute and Hospital in Gurgaon, on the outskirts of New Delhi performed a number of operations free of charge . Surgeons have been surprised at Roona's recovery, having warned her parents she was unlikely to survive despite the treatment . Neurosurgeon Dr Sandeep Vaishya said: 'I see a lot of improvement, which I didn't expect. She has started laughing, she makes a lot of sounds and she occasionally speaks a few words' The toddler underwent several rounds . of surgery in May and June last year with doctors draining excess fluid . from her head and dramatically reducing the size of her skull. She . spent 105 days at the hospital before being discharged in August and . then returned in December for further reconstruction on her deformed . skull. Neurosurgeon Dr Sandeep Vaishya who assessed Roona again this week has been surprised by the extent of her recovery - but says there is still has a long road ahead. He said: 'I see a lot of improvement, which I didn't expect. She has started laughing, she makes a lot of sounds and she occasionally speaks a few words. 'She has gained a lot of weight and her activities have improved a lot. But whether she will be able to live a normal life, nobody can say. 'But most likely I don't think she will be absolutely normal because with such a severe case of hydrocephalus there has to be some damage to the brain. 'But with the improvement she has shown we are hopeful she will be able to do some things.' A scan shows Roona's head now, after surgeons managed to reduce the size of her skull . Roona, pictured left at 21 months old and right with her father Abdul Rahman, 21, is unlikely to ever make a full recovery, with experts warning she has probably suffered some brain damage . Roona's progress has been so good . that Dr Vaishya now wants to proceed with yet another operation to . further reduce the size of her head. But . her concerned father Abdul Rahman, 21, who has seen her brought back . from the brink several times, is worried about the risks. 'My wife has been through a lot with Roona's condition and in the past people have suggested we give her away to an orphanage or an ashram [a type of spiritual monastery],' said the illiterate bricklayer, who earns just £2 a day. 'But we say no. My wife says - ""This is my baby. If she lives, she will live with us. If she dies, it will be my lap"".' 'So if the doctors can guarantee the surgery will definitely make her better and make her able to sit up, talk and be like a normal kid, then we would want it. 'But if they cannot give us that assurance, then we don't need it. We would much rather let her be as she is.'","Roona Begum was rushed to hospital last year with an extreme form of hydrocephalus - water on the brain .

"Murderer: Ali Syed killed three people and himself in the bloody shooting spree in California . The two male victims of a 20-year-old college student were identified on Tuesday night after they were shot dead in the street during a murder and carjacking spree. Business owner Melvin Lee Edwards, 69, was on his way to work when he crossed paths with shooter Ali Syed, of Ladera Ranch, California and was killed 'execution-style', witnesses said. The second male victim, 26-year-old construction worker Jeremy Lewis of Fullerton, was killed a short time later at an electronics store and his small truck carjacked. Syed was identified by police on Tuesday afternoon, hours after the early morning massacre which began at his family home. His first victim, described as a woman . in her 20s, was not identified. She was not related to the shooter and . it is unclear what she was doing at the home. Syed's 25-minute shooting spree through Orange County left a bloody trail of dead and injured victims in a series of carjackings and gunfire, police said. Authorities reported at least five places where victims had been shot in the early morning violence - and at least four are dead - including Syed who took his own life. Authorities said Syed was taking one course at Saddleback College, a two-year community college. The shootings began at 4.45am when . deputies responding to a call found the body of a female who was shot multiple times in a . house in Ladera Ranch, Orange County sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said.

A Florida couple have been charged with child abuse after keeping two children locked in a cage in what police described as a 'house of horrors.' Sean Pearson and Jessica Rowland were accused of treating the 11 year old boy and 12 year old girl like a 'rabid dog.' Polk County Police chief Grady Judd said the victims were put into a cage and left in a closet. House of horrors: Sean Pearson, 33, (left) and Jessica Rowland are accused of beating a brother and sister aged 11 ad 12 in their Florida home where they strung them up by the wrists and kept them locked in a cage . The 12 year old girl had her head shaved and also had her wrists tied together and the rope strung over a beam as a form of punishment . 'You can’t imagine treating your worst enemy the way they treated these two babies,' said Polk County Sheriff Judd. The children were rescued from a home in Lakeland, Florida, which Judd called a “house of horrors.” The couple were looking after the children but authorities did not say what relationship they were to the pair. According to an arrest affidavit the couple forced the children to sit on cans of vegetables until their bottoms turned numb. The 12 year old girl was also forcibly fed prescription pills to calm her down. Police said the pills belonged to 33 year old Pearson for his bi-polar disorder. Sick: Pearson reportedly was arrested in 2005 for sexual battery on a child under 12 . The affidavit revealed the couple would encourage the children to fight each other while they say and watched. When the children screamed too loudly they would cover up their mouths with their hands. Neighbor Randi Evans, who alerted police to the alleged abuse, said he would often hear the screams of the children. 'They were in pain screams, scared screams,' he told WFLA TV. Evans called police after he watched as the naked children were hosed down with a pressure washer outside their home. Evans said the younger child had a red mark on his back. Pearson, who was charged with sexual battery on a victim under the age of 12 in 2005, told detectives he and his 21 year old girlfriend disciplined the children. He told investigators he could 'write a book' on the discipline. Sheriff Judd said he went into great detail about what he did to the children prompting the investigation and their arrest. Pearson and Rowland were being held on a combined bond of $400,00 at the Polk County Jail after facing six aggravated child abuse charges.

"A Pennsylvania teacher who had sex with two students an flashed her breasts at another teen has been jailed for up to 23 months. Lauren Harrington-Cooper enticed the students into sexual affairs by telling them: 'All the candy you need is right here.' The married 32-year-old pleaded guilty to having sexual intercourse with an 18-year-old student in her car and also performing oral sex. She also had sex with a 17 year old she had met while teaching in the Wyoming Valley West School district in Pennsylvania. Harrington-Cooper, an English teacher, pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual contact with students and two counts of corrupting minors. Pennsylvania high school teacher Lauren Harrington-Cooper was sentenced to 9 to 23 months in jail, accused of having sex with two students . Harrington-Cooper, 32, is walked to her jail cell after her sentencing for sex crimes in Pennsylvania on Thursday . Prosecutors said she showed her breasts to a 17 year old and had sexual contact with another. Harrington-Cooper was sentenced to nine to 23 months in jail, according to the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader newspaper. Assistant District Attorney Jenny Roberts said the four victims had moved on with their lives. 'The defendant was in a position of authority with these students and she took advantage of that,' Roberts said. 'They're just happy to move on with their lives.' Harrington-Cooper was first arrested in December on charges she had sex with an 18-year-old student. The following month, investigators charged her with sending explicit text messages and performing oral sex on a 17-year-old boy. She was also charged with two counts of corruption of minors for having 'sexually explicit conversations' with two other boys, aged 16 and 17. School officials insisted no sexual contact took place on school grounds, but police said she made the remark about 'all the candy you want' while in school. She did not speak at her sentencing in Wilkes-Barre, where she was pictured being escorted out in handcuffs. Her attorney Joe D'Andrea, said that Harrington-Cooper accepted responsibility for her actions, apologized to the victims and that she would use her time in jail to reflect on her actions. Court date: Harrington-Cooper was surrounded by reporters as she entered the court after her first arrest in December . Controversy: Lauren Harrington-Cooper (pictured with her husband) is a married high school teacher . He said she suffers from 'self-image issues of acceptance and love.' 'She has been diagnosed with some significant psychological issues of inadequacy,' D'Andrea said. 'You would think that she's a pretty, young girl, that she would feel good about herself,' the attorney added. 'But her self-esteem issues have really troubled her all of her life, and she found comfort and solace in some people giving her attention, as wrong as it was.' Luzerne County Judge Michael Vough said he hopes Harrington-Cooper can move on with her life after serving her time. 'You used your position of trust to exploit children,' Vough said.

"A teenager has told how she was 'stalked' by the prime suspect in the murder of Arkansas realtor Beverly Carter just a few months ago. Alex Rowe said she was so terrified of convicted felon Arron Lewis that she filed a harassment complaint with police. The 19-year-old told MailOnline in an exclusive interview that Lewis gave her 'the creeps' after he repeatedly sent her messages on Facebook. Scroll down for video . Creepy: Alex Rowe described how her neighbor Lewis wouldn't leave her alone after befriending him . Arrogant: Alex said that 'He thought he was so smooth that women would just fall at his feet' 'He just would not leave me alone and would keep on sending messages,' Alex said. 'It just got all too much and I had to go to the police to file a complaint. I was being stalked and it felt so uncomfortable. I felt like he was watching me all the time. 'The messages would not stop and it was really creepy. I told him I would go to the police and that's what I did.' Mrs Carter's body was found in a shallow grave at a concrete company where Lewis worked in a rural area 25 miles northeast of Little Rock. She had been missing since last Thursday after going alone to show a house. Lewis was arrested on Monday and is facing a murder charge in the 49-year-old's death. When confronted by a reporter over why he did it, he replied: 'Because she was just a woman that worked alone, a rich broker.' At a press conference on Tuesday, police said the attack was random. They offered few extra details, but Pulaski County Sheriff Doc Holladay said they were able to track Mrs Carter's phone, leading to the discovery of her body. The sheriff, however, would not say how she died. Rowe said that she believed that Carter thought he could get any woman he wanted. 'He thought he was so smooth that women would just fall at his feet,' said Alex. 'He was always chatting up women and saying that he could have anyone he wanted. He thought women would believe whatever he said.' Rowe, who works as an Avon beauty sales lady, said she filed the harassment report five months ago shortly before the birth of her first son. 'It did not surprise me when I heard he was a suspect in the realtor's disappearance. I would not put anything past him,' she said. Lewis has a long criminal history, including charges of felony theft; accomplice to theft; unlawful removal of theft device; obstruction of government operations, and other counts. Lewis also has rap sheets in Kansas City, Missouri, and in Utah. He was released in Arkansas in August 2013 and was on parole until 2017. Law enforcement would not release details of Rowe's complaint to MailOnline. Alex and Lewis lived next door to each other for several months before the suspect moved to Jacksonville, Arkansas. Video courtesy of Arkansas Matters . Confession? Asked by a reporter why he targeted Beverly Carter, Lewis told a reporter: 'Because she was just a woman that worked alone, a rich broker' Drama: Beverly, left, went missing on Thursday after going alone to show a home. On Sunday, it was revealed that Lewis, right, was involved in a car accident, was given treatment, and fled until his arrest on Monday . Gotcha! Police arrest Lewis on Monday after passersby spotted him and helped officers tackle him . Lewis was living in a trailer home in south Little Rock when he met Rowe who was pregnant with her first child. She said he would spend hours each day on Facebook and despite her requests for him to stop, continually send her messages. 'I was living with my sister-in-law and he was in a trailer next door,' she said. 'I would get all these messages non-stop. They just got so tiresome and some of them were not nice. I felt that he was stalking me and I could not do anything because he was watching me all the time.' Carter’s murder came after Lewis had been arguing with his 38 year old wife Crystal Lowery at their home in Jacksonville, Arkansas. The argument got so heated police were called, according to two neighbour interviewed by MailOnline. 'All I could hear was doors slamming and lots of screaming and shouting,' said one neighbour who asked not to be named. 'It was awful. Someone else called the police because it was going on for so long.' The neighbour said Lewis and his wife and lived in the house for almost a year – and described their relationship as 'very volatile.' 'They were always arguing and seem to be at each other’s throats.' Lowery, a trainee nurse, has gone into hiding since her husband's arrest. She was briefly seen at the family home on Sunday where she picked up some clean clothes. Another neighbour told how Lewis asked to borrow a drill on Friday night – by which time police believe Mrs Carter was already dead. 'He seem very calm and there was nothing out of the ordinary,' said the neighbour. 'We always got on well with him and he was no trouble but it is spooky to think he was back here while that poor woman was missing.' Prior to moving into the trailer home Lewis had owned a single-storey home in south Little Rock. Neighbors Calvin and Donna Crutchfile ended up buying the two-bedroom home from Lewis earlier this year. They said after learning he was a suspect in the kidnapping of Mrs Carter they feared he would come back to the house. 'I must admit I was a bit on edge,' said Mr Crutchfile. 'The house he once owned was empty and I thought he might come back to hide out. It made me pretty nervous and I called the State Police out here.' Crutchfile said he was aware that Lewis had multiple convictions for theft but said while he lived next door he was a good neighbor. 'He was not trouble. There were no loud parties and we got on well. I knew he had been in prison but everyone deserves a second chance. He is not the first person to go away and come out. I did not hold that against him.' Another neighbor said Lewis had an expensive motorbike and pick up truck - but never appeared to work. 'I always wondered where he got all his money,' said the neighbor. 'I am told that he bought the house for cash. I could never work out where he was getting his money from.' Relationship trouble: Lewis gushed about his wife online in between lamenting them having split up. He also posted an advert on dating website Plenty of Fish, right, looking for hook ups . Trailer: Lewis lived in this trailer home in Little Rock next to Alex before moving to Jacksonville, Arkansas . Prior to his arrest Lewis was active on Facebook detailing his love life. In July he wrote in glowing terms about wife Crystal. But just months earlier he had said they had split up and declared himself single. Lewis posted a picture of himself on the online dating site 'Plenty of Fish'. He was also candid about his criminal past and detailed his various arrests on Facebook. Among the postings were five pages from a police report where he claimed he was the victim of a home invasion and threatened with a gun. The police report from October 2013 describes how two men burst into the home he was sharing with his then girlfriend Ashley Mitchell. One of the men was her estranged husband and in his report to the police Lewis claimed he was threatened with a gun and Ashley ordered to leave. When police responded they located Jesse Mitchell who denied making any threats. A search of his vehicle and the surrounding area did not reveal any firearm. When contacted by MailOnline Ashley Mitchell said she had nothing to say. A friend added: 'Ashley was going through a rough patch and hooked up with Arron. That ended a long time ago and she has had nothing to do with him for months.' Mrs Carter went missing from an empty home in Scott after meeting a mystery buyer who arrived in a pick up truck. Her purse was found in her car and the front door of the vacant property open. Her husband Carl reported her missing when she failed to return home. He later said he received three text messages from his wife which were completely out of character for her. Despite an extensive search by police and hundreds of volunteers since she disappeared on Friday there has been no sign of the popular blonde real estate agent. Tragedy: Beverly's husband and family had been hoping for her safe return before the grim discovery . Lewis was named as a person of interest on Sunday and was briefly held by police after a road traffic accident. Before an arrest warrant could be issued he fled from hospital where he was being treated for facial injuries sustained when his car skidded into a ditch. Lewis was arrested on Monday morning after a member of the public recognized his photo from the local media and called 911. He was captured after allegedly pulling a knife on a bystander who had followed him to an office building. Lewis tried to flee from the Pleasant Pointe apartments on Green Mountain Drive but was held and handcuffed.","Alex Rowe called police after Arron Lewis bombarded her with Facebook messages 5 months ago when they were neighbors in Little Rock, Arkansas .

"Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has criticised the decision to allow CSKA Moscow fans in to Tuesday night's behind-closed-doors Champions League game in Russia. Moscow's Khimki Arena was supposed to be empty apart from media, club officials and sponsors guests after UEFA punished CSKA for problems with their supporters in the past. But City played out a disappointing 2-2 draw against a background of noise and fierce support from about 300 fans in the main stand. Around 300 CSKA Moscow fans were in the main stand, despite the match being played behind closed doors . The CSKA fans watched their side come from behind to secure a point against Manchester City . UEFA had ordered the match to be played behind closed doors because of racist behaviour by CSKA fans . Official crowd - 0 . Club delegates - 75 per club . Centre circle boys and parents - 50 . Media - 150 . UEFA partners (sponsors) - 300 . With no City fans present, it made for a peculiar environment and now UEFA are to investigate after suggestions sponsors tickets and media passes were sold to regular fans on the black market. An angry Kompany said: 'This one really annoys me and maybe it's on top of other things as well. 'You say ""No fans"" then all of a sudden you turn up and basically the only team that hasn't got fans is Man City. City threw away a two-goal lead as Seydou Doumbia and Natcho scored in the second half for the hosts . Natcho's late penalty made it 2-2 after City had looked comfortable after going two goals ahead in Moscow . James Milner scored City's second, sliding home to meat a cross from their first goalscorer Sergio Aguero . 'So who's getting punished? Who is being done for racism? Man City or Moscow, you know? 'I don't have a problem, they'll say it's sponsors and so on and they need to give certain allocations, but why are we getting punished, you know? 'And again, because you'll have people in your papers writing columns saying 'he should be looking at his own performance and stuff' – so, done – we've analysed it and we know we should have done better and that but things like this are unacceptable to honest, there's just no fairness in it.' Some of the spectators situated in front of the City officials in the stand appeared to be drunk and spent much of the game standing up with beer glasses singing and chanting. City were leading 2-0 at half-time but only took a point in the end after a controversial late penalty gave CSKA their first point of the group stages. 'It doesn't have an effect on the players,' added Kompany. Players from both teams line up before the match with a respect banner campaigning against racism . Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany was not afraid to criticise that CSKA fans were allowed in to watch . Kompany questioned who was being punished after CSKA fans appeared to have been allowed in . 'Its just little things when you leave with a result like this. 'Obviously you can't deny there's a bit of frustration, and I'm not looking for an excuse, but if you want to play it fair then, fair enough, you've got to let your sponsors have some tickets but why the hell do we not have any fans here? 'Why? What have our fans done wrong? 'So it needs to be looked at, it needs to be changed, because our fans shouldn't be punished.' City have made their views known to UEFA and the governing body have promised to look in to the issue. Officials from UEFA were seen taking photos and videos of the spectators during the second half. Despite Milner and Aguero's efforts, the game ended 2-2 meaning City have failed to win in Europe this season .","Vincent Kompany angry at presence of 300 CSKA Moscow supporters .

"Hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens are getting shocking letters in their mailboxes instead of tax refund checks – nastygrams informing them that the federal government has seized their money to repay debts their parents decades-old debts that they never settled. In some cases, they're debts the parents never knew they had. And no one warned their children. The 2008 Farm Bill included a single line that made it possible, allowing the government for the first time to hunt down individual taxpayers who have owed Uncle Sam money for more than ten years. If the debtor is deceased, according to the Federal Trade Commission, the money is considered a write-off. But the Social Security Administration has a different view of the law, chasing down adults whose parents cared for them with unintentionally overpaid benefits. Frustrated: Mary Grice and her attorney Robert Vogel sued the federal government for seizing money it says the Social Security Administration incorrectly paid her mother 37 years ago . Shock: Social Security overpayments made decades ago are boomeranging on the beneficiaries' children . The Treasury Department has been exercising its new authority since 2011, bringing in $424 million in old debts that were previously considered out of reach. Social Security says it's identified 400,000 taxpayers whose families have owed a combined $714 million for ten years or more. Every oen of those, the agency claims, will learn their fate by this summer. Since January the government has recovered more than $95 million in ancient obligations. That's a fraction of the $1.9 billion the Treasury has seized overall in 2014, most of it owed for a much shorter time. But it's the targeting of Americans for their deceased parents' decades-old delinquent Social Security accounts – often without solid evidence of exactly who received errant payments in the first place – that has people up in arms. Social Security spokeswoman Dorothy Clark told The Washington Post on Thursday that '[w]e have an obligation to current and future Social Security beneficiaries to attempt to recoup money that people received when it was not due.' Mary Grice, a 56 year-old Food and Drug Administration employee, told the Post that she received a threatening letter in March advising her that all $4,462 of her 2013 tax refund was seized to compensate the government for overpaying her mother Sadie's Social Security benefits in 1977. The bill came to $2,996, but the government captured Mary's entire refund check. Sadie Grice died in 2010. 'What incenses me is the way they went about this,' Mary said. 'They gave me no notice, they can’t prove that I received any overpayment, and they use intimidation tactics, threatening to report this to the credit bureaus.' She sued the Social Security authorities this week in federal court, arguing that her due process rights were violated when the government put her on the hook for a debt that allegedly traces back to her long-dead father's benefit account. Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer (2nd R) and Barbara Mikulski (L) are demanding the Social Security Administration cancel debts that are more than ten years old and incurred through no fault of the person who's currently on the hook . Looking for one of these this April? Check your parents' credit reports first. Sadly, it doesn't matter if they passed away years ago . The agency told the Post that it always tries to contact taxpayers before seizing their money. In Grice's case, they send postcards to a PO box where she hasn't received mail since 1979. Somehow, though, they knew the correct address to reach her when it was time to take her tax refund. Robert Vogel, a lawyer who took Grice's case pro bono, told the Post that '[t]he craziest part of this whole thing is the way the government seizes a child’s money to satisfy a debt that child never even knew about.' 'They’ll say that somebody got paid for that child’s benefit, but the child had no control over the money and there’s no way to know if the parent ever used the money for the benefit of that kid.' Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer of California and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland wrote to Acting Social Security Commissioner Carolyn Colvin on Friday, asking for a time-out. 'While this policy of seizing tax refunds to repay decades-old Social Security overpayments might be allowed under the law, it is entirely unjust,' they wrote. 'Garnishing taxpayers’ refunds to pay for debts that are more than a decade old – and incurred through no fault of their own – is a policy that cannot be continued in good conscience.' Wants her day in court: The feds are going after deceased debtors' children, even if the children had nothing to do with the debt in the first place . In an online essay, CNBC producer Jake Novak noted that tax refund checks are now 'the new promised land for government regulators and bureaucrats desperate for more revenues.' The Obamacare law, for instance, was designed to use the IRS as a mechanism to collect penalties levied for disobeying the individual medical insurance mandate. The Social Security administration is the latest example. Already 1,200 Americans have filed appeals on seizures of old debts that they say don't belong to them. But they win only 10 per cent of the time. 'We have a case of the government saying: ""When you screw up, you pay. When we screw up, you also pay"",' wrote Novak.","U.S. Treasury has grabbed $75 million this year from Americans whose debts are more than 10 years old, thanks to a single line in the farm bill .
Many of the debts trace back to the deceased parents of the people who now see their IRS tax refund checks sent back to Washington, D.C.
Only about 10 per cent of appeals are granted .
A Maryland woman said she lost nearly $3,000 because the Social Security Administration overpaid her mother in 1977 after her husband died, leaving her with five children to raise .
Before the farm bill language turned up, Uncle Sam couldn't recover money that was owed for more than a decade ."
"Nasa's Maven spacecraft arrived at Mars late Sunday after a 442 million-mile journey that began nearly a year ago. The robotic explorer fired its brakes and successfully slipped into orbit around the red planet, officials confirmed. 'This is such an incredible night,' said John Grunsfeld, Nasa's chief for science missions. Scroll down for video . Nasa robotic explorer Maven fired its brakes and successfully slipped into orbit around the red planet today, officials confirmed . Now the real work begins for the $671 million mission, the first dedicated to studying Mars' upper atmosphere. Flight controllers in Colorado will spend the next six weeks adjusting Maven's altitude and checking its science instruments. It will then start probing the upper atmosphere of Mars. The spacecraft will conduct its observations from orbit; it's not meant to land. Scientists believe the Martian atmosphere holds clues as to how Earth's neighbor went from being warm and wet billions of years ago to cold and dry. That early wet world may have harbored microbial life, a tantalizing question yet to be answered. NASA launched Maven last November from Cape Canaveral, the 10th US mission sent to orbit the red planet. Three earlier ones failed, and until the official word came of success late Sunday night, the entire team was on edge. 'I don't have any fingernails any more, but we've made it,' said Colleen Hartman, deputy director for science at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. 'It's incredible.' After six weeks, it will  start probing the upper atmosphere of Mars. The spacecraft will conduct its observations from orbit as it is not meant to land . The spacecraft was clocking more than 10,000 mph when it hit the brakes for the so-called orbital insertion, a half-hour process. The world had to wait 12 minutes to learn the outcome, once it occurred, because of the lag in spacecraft signals given the 138 million miles between the two planets on Sunday. 'Based on observed navigation data, congratulations, Maven is now in Mars orbit,' came the official announcement. Flight controllers applauded the news and shook hands; laughter filled the previously tense-filled room. Maven joins three spacecraft already circling Mars, two American and one European. And the traffic jam isn't over: India's first interplanetary probe, Mangalyaan, will reach Mars in two days and also aim for orbit. Maven's chief investigator, Bruce Jakosky of the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics in Boulder, hopes to learn where all the water on Mars went, along with the carbon dioxide that once comprised an atmosphere thick enough to hold moist clouds. The gases may have been stripped away by the sun early in Mars' existence, escaping into the upper atmosphere and out into space. Maven's observations should be able to extrapolate back in time, Jakosky said. Maven — short for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission — will spend at least a year collecting data. That's a full Earth year, half a Martian one. Its orbit will dip as low as 78 miles above the Martian surface as its eight instruments make measurements. The craft is as long as a school bus, from solar wingtip to tip, and as hefty as an SUV. Maven will have a rare brush with a comet next month. The nucleus of newly discovered Comet Siding Spring will pass 82,000 miles from Mars on Oct. 19. The risk of comet dust damaging Maven is low, officials said, and the spacecraft should be able to observe Siding Spring as a science bonus. The explorer has travelled 442 million miles since it took off from the Kennedy Space Center last year . Lockheed Martin Corp., Maven's maker, is operating the mission from its control center at Littleton, Colorado. This is NASA's 21st shot at Mars and the first since the Curiosity rover landed on the red planet in 2012. Just this month, Curiosity arrived at its prime science target, a mountain named Sharp, ripe for drilling. The Opportunity rover is also still active a decade after landing. All these robotic scouts are paving the way for the human explorers that NASA hopes to send in the 2030s. The space agency wants to understand as much about the red planet as possible before it sends people there.","Robot fired its brakes and slipped into orbit around the red planet .

"Tammy Lynn Hankins has four children and works as a physician's assistant . A mother of four has been jailed for three and half years for having sex with a friend of her teenage children. Tammy Lynn Hankins had sex dozens of times with a 16-year-old student - leading to him being nicknamed 'Legend' by his friends. The teen told police he slept with the 43-year-old Tammy Lynn Hankins at various homes in the Lake Havasu area of Arizona near the California state line. He also said she bought him alcohol, a water bong and a video game and told him to deny they had sex if they were ever caught. Hankins is a physician's assistant who used to be married to a plastic surgeon - though the couple have since divorced. When he jailed her for three and half years, Judge Derek Carlisle told her most of the sentence was for violating probation for a previous drug conviction by having sex with the teen. Judge Carlisle added on another year for the sexual relations, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. Carlisle said society might apply a double standard when comparing men having sex with girls to women having sex with boys, but he said the prison sentence reflects that the law makes no such distinction. According to a police report the boy's father was puzzled why his son's friends referred to him as 'Legend,' the Arizona Independent reports. It was only after the arrest of Hankins that he understood why his son was given the moniker by his school friends. Gossip about Hankins and the teen circulated among other teens at Lake Havasu High School, where authorities heard about the relationship. Hankins was on probation for prescription medication fraud at the time of the affair with the student. Most of her three-and-a-half-year prison sentence was a result of violating her probation . Hankins is a physician's assistant and was married to a plastic surgeon for several years . Detective Tom Gray investigated the rumors and conducted interviews with the victim and Hankins last December. The teen said he had sex with Hankins in three different homes between late July and early November, 2013. 'He does not remember specifics about each time but he had sexual intercourse with Tammy between two dozen and three dozen times,' Gray wrote in an arrest report. Hankins also told him to deny everything if anybody asked about what was happening, the boy said. Hankins, a physician's assistant, admitted having sex with the teen eight to ten times. She told the detective she initially resisted the boy's advances but after a row with her boyfriend gave in and had sex. Hankins told Gray she did not know the boy was 16 years old until there was police involvement. Hankins also admitted purchasing a $200 bong and a Grand Theft Auto 5 game for her alleged teen lover. The items cannot legally be purchased by anyone under 18. Hankins admitted buying alcohol for the teen. Shewas found guilty of four counts of sexual conduct with a minor and one count of furnishing obscene or harmful items to a minor.","Tammy Lynn Hankins had sex with the teenage boy dozens of times before the affair was discovered .

"State school pupils are winning places at the country’s elite universities with lower A-level grades than their privately educated counterparts, say researchers. They are more likely to be admitted to Russell Group universities with B or C grades than pupils from independent schools. And those admitted from the state sector are around 20 per cent less likely to have A* or A grades. The findings are likely to reignite the debate over the ‘social engineering’ of university places. State school pupils are more likely to get into Russell Group universities with B or Cs than those from private schools . Some private schools are already threatening to boycott universities that are shown to discriminate against their pupils. An analysis of A-level grades held by students entering Russell Group universities shows that those from state schools have significantly weaker grades on average. Fifty-two per cent of the qualifications held by independent school pupils entering 19 of the group’s 24 universities in 2010-11 were either A* or A at A-level. This fell to 42 per cent among state entrants, according to data compiled by the student information website BestCourse4me.com. The grades B and C made up 24.3 per cent of the marks received by state entrants compared with only 18.2 per cent among independent school students. The gap in achievement was most marked in the highly selective universities. But it was still apparent at the five Russell Group members that are least popular with private pupils: Cardiff, Sheffield, Liverpool, Glasgow and Queen’s University Belfast. The research comes as universities face increasing pressure to admit more schools from disadvantaged areas and low performing state schools. Professor Les Ebdon, director of the Office for Fair Access, has called for universities to set ‘stretching’ targets for recruiting students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Sheffield University, pictured, was one of a number of top institutions not favoured by private school pupils . This is in return for the right to charge up to £9,000 a year tuition fees. He has previously backed the use of differential offers for students from struggling state comprehensives, allowing them to win places with lower grade A-levels than those from high-flying schools. While OFFA does not set universities official targets for state entrants, it does challenge them to do more to promote applications from poor students. And guidance on its website says that institutions can mark out poor pupils with potential to succeed by admitting them with lower grades. Anna Vignoles, professor of education at Cambridge University, told the Times Higher Education magazine that this pressure might explain why state pupils have been admitted with lower grades. ‘Universities are very alive to these targets, contrary to what is often reported,’ she said. ‘When universities have good quality state school students, albeit with slightly lower grades, you can see there is a willingness to get them in.’ Chris Ramsey, of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, which represents top independent schools, said it was ‘unjustifiable’ to ask for higher grades as a ‘blanket policy’. He said: ‘There may always be reasons for an individual student to be given a lower – or higher – offer than that advertised publicly, but a policy which treated students as simply members of a group would be entirely wrong and should be stopped.’","State school pupils more likely to get into top universities with B or Cs .

"A-levels and GCSEs have got easier over the past decade, an official analysis has confirmed. A series of reports by Ofqual, the exam watchdog, has found that  science and geography papers are ‘softer’ and ‘less demanding’. Teenagers now have more multiple choice questions and papers with less scientific content. GCSEs and A-levels in science and geography are easier than they were ten years ago, the exams regulator Ofqual has said (posed by models) The watchdog warns that the dumbing down is leaving pupils ill-prepared for university and means there is less opportunity for good students to shine. Last week Glenys Stacey, the chief executive of Ofqual, said the value of exams had been undermined by more than a decade of ‘persistent grade inflation’ which was ‘impossible to justify’. Four years ago, researchers from Durham University concluded that A-levels are now two grades easier than they were two decades ago. Sixth formers who would have got a grade C in the 1980s would now get an A. Last night, the Department for Education said the reports ‘show evidence of a gradual decline in standards’. A spokesman said: ‘In particular these reports show that in recent years not enough has been demanded of students, and that they are not being asked to demonstrate real depth and breadth of knowledge. ‘It is good that Ofqual has already taken action to strengthen the science GCSEs and we are committed to restoring confidence in all GCSEs and A-levels as rigorous and valued qualifications.’ Slide: Since 2001 figures show more pupils are getting top grades . The watchdog conducted reviews of GCSEs and A-levels in biology and chemistry between 2003 and 2008 as well as A-level geography between 2001 and 2010 and A-level critical thinking in 2010. The findings showed that among GCSEs, changes to the way the exams were structured had ‘reduced the demand’ of the qualifications, while the A-level reviews found that changes to the way papers were assessed had made them easier. The A-level geography review found that the removal of coursework from the qualification in 2010 – which was usually a 4,000-word investigation – had made it ‘less demanding’. It also revealed that there had been a shift ‘towards human geography and away from physical geography’, fewer subjects were covered and there were fewer chances to assess pupils’ skills. The review added that the content of A-level geography had ‘softened’ and that harder topics, such as atmospheric systems, had been removed . The A-level chemistry review found exams . had become easier between 2003 and 2008. The A-level geography review . found the removal of coursework from the qualification in 2010 had made . it 'less demanding' (picture, left, posed by model) GCSE biology was easier  because there were more short papers with multiple choice and short answer questions. Ofqual added that reviewers were also struck by the ‘poor quality’ of some multiple choice questions, which sometimes included ‘trivial or irrelevant’ information and even ‘made-up words’ which made it easy for anyone with a basic command of the English language to pass. The A-level biology study criticised WJEC, the Welsh exam board, for having a high percentage of short structured questions, which reduced the amount of information pupils had to read. The CCEA exam board in Northern Ireland was over-generous in its marking of some questions and had less demanding coursework, Ofqual added. The A-level chemistry review found that the exams had become easier between 2003 and 2008 because the questions were structured differently. ‘In 2008 there were more short answer questions, involving simple recall, and fewer questions that required students to formulate multiple-step responses,’ the report said. In a statement, Ofqual said that GCSEs are due to be revised after the current review of the national curriculum, while  A-levels will also be reviewed. Damian Hinds, a Tory member of the Commons education select committee, said: ‘I doubt there is anyone left who will be surprised to hear that standards were eroded under Labour. ‘Many ways were found to make the results tables look better, and many young people given bad advice to take more “accessible” subjects and supposed GCSE equivalents. ‘Now we know that even within these traditional subjects papers became easier. ‘In the end the people it lets down are the students who worked so hard for those exams, and it is right for young people’s sake that this government is determined to ensure rigour in exams.’","Ofqual, the exam watchdog, found more multiple choice questions and papers with less scientific content .

"Huge salaries and lavish expenses are allowing Members of the European Parliament to live like ‘latter-day Roman senators’, a report warned yesterday. The shocking study found that cosseted MEPs now have incomes up to 20 times higher than the people they represent. While millions of families across Europe have had their incomes squeezed, most MEPs have enjoyed large increases in their salaries –  while continuing to vote through ever-higher budgets for the EU. MEPs in Brussels from the member nations earn £137million a year before allowances and expenses . The study found that MEPs now enjoy an average income of £182,826  including allowances for attendance and travel. The figure is almost ten times higher . than the average EU wage of £18,617 a year. It is also 695 per cent . higher than the average UK salary of £23,000. The biggest discrepancy is in . Bulgaria, where the average wage is just £8,500 – less than a twentieth . of the salary of an MEP. Over a five-year term MEPs now have an income . approaching £1million. The report, by the German website Preisvergleich.de, estimates it would take the average Bulgarian 108 . years to earn the same sum. The European Union project has been rocked by a series of scandals . Unlike MPs in this country, MEPs still . vote on their own salaries and perks. Until 2010 they received the same . salary as an MP in their own country – equal to £65,738 in this . country, but just £9,046 in Bulgaria. But at that point they decided to ‘equalise’ salaries based on those of the best-paid countries, Germany and Italy. The decision has led to most MEPs . getting a huge boost in income at a time when their own citizens have . been suffering as a result of the recession. MEPs like Nigel Farage earn about 200 per cent more than Westminster MPs, according to the research . The report says the situation is . reminiscent of ancient Rome, adding: ‘The survey results show the huge . income disparities between the EU citizens battered by the economic . crisis and their EU parliamentarians, concluding with one thesis only; . we are dealing in Brussels and some national parliaments of the EU . countries with conditions similar to ancient Rome, because just like in . the former Roman Senate none of these “new class EU senators” are . controlled in any way. ‘The extreme differences in pay structure between politicians and citizens are very serious. ‘There is at least as much need for . discussion on this issue as on the EU’s plan to cap the manager salaries . of public companies.’ The salaries and allowances of the . MEPs of the 27 EU states now total £137million. But this does not . include the cost of the £217,000 office allowance available to each MEP. The report also looks at some of the extraordinary perks available to MPs in some national parliaments. In Italy, MPs are allowed to claim expenses for haircuts, while Maltese MPs get 240 litres of petrol a month. The revelations will add to concern . about the cost of the European Parliament, which maintains expensive . legislatures in both Brussels and Strasbourg but still has relatively . few real powers, except over the EU budget where it has repeatedly voted . for above-inflation increases.","MEP perks receive free haircuts and 52 gallons of petrol a month .

"A woman who called police after seeing a young child left alone in a hot car was allegedly run over by the boy's angry mom - and may never walk again. Shannon Dominguez was on the phone to police when she had a confrontation with 27-year-old Kristina Riddell. The 43-year-old was hit by Riddell's Honda car and left with a back injury with doctors warning she might never walk again. Scroll down for video . Injured: Shannon Dominguez (right) was ran over by an angry mother in June after reporting the woman's child locked in a hot car. Her boyfriend Alan Mason (left) was also there and witnessed the incident . Wheelchair bound: Doctors say Dominguez (left) may never walk again after the incident. Her boyfriend Mason (right) was punched in the attack . 'Every day is a chore. Every day is stressful,' said Dominguez, whose left leg was crushed in the June 7 incident. She is now wheelchair bound and faces months of rehabilitation to try and walk again. Collared: Kristina Riddell, 27, was later arrested and charged with hit and run, assault and child abuse . Dominguez told Fox 31 News she was outside a store in Longmont, Colorado, when she saw a small boy alone in a car. Fearing he might be overcome by the heat she called police. The boy's mother mother Riddell allegedly became angry when she realized police had been called. She punched Dominguez's boyfriend, Alan Mason, before running the couple over with her white Honda. Mason was thrown over the hood while Dominguez's leg was crushed under the wheels of the car. Riddell sped off, but was later arrested and charged with multiple offenses. Mason said: 'She had her windows down, so I grabbed onto the door. She drug me about 20 feet. I realized she was not going to stop, so I let go. I tumbled in the parking lot.' Doctors said Mason suffered internal and external bruising. Dominguez said she had no regrets about calling for help as she feared the boy could die from being in a baking-hot car. 'All four windows were rolled up. And it was in the direct sun. It scares the heck out of me. It's some innocent child might die,' Dominguez told the station. Family photo: Riddell pictured above with a boy who appears to be her son in a picture posted to her Facebook . She added that next time she might call 911 and leave rather than wait around, but added: 'If it means helping a child, I'd do it in a heartbeat.' Riddell was arrested at her home in Longmont. She was charged with hit-and-run, assault and child abuse. Fox 13 said she has an extensive criminal record, including arrests for assault, domestic violence and multiple driving violations.","Shannon Dominguez, 43, was outside a store in Longmont, Colorado this past June when she noticed a young boy locked in a hot car .

"Top degrees have been awarded to every single student on dozens of British degree courses, a Mail on Sunday investigation into ‘rampant’ grade inflation has found. On more than 50 courses at universities across the country, in subjects ranging from engineering to English, 100 per cent of students were awarded a First or a 2:1. At some institutions, the proportion of students achieving at least a 2:1 - a key requirement for many employers - has leapt over the past five years. On more than 50 courses at universities across the country, in subjects ranging from engineering to English, 100 per cent of students were awarded a First or a 2:1 . Critics said universities were pushing up grades as a ‘marketing ploy’ to attract students paying up to £9,000 a year, and warned that degrees no longer reflect the true abilities of graduates. However, universities said the rises reflected improvements in A-level grades. Among the 40 universities that responded to freedom of information requests, 32 had degree courses where between 90 and 100 per cent of students were awarded a First or a 2:1. On some courses, more than half of the  students were awarded Firsts. All 31 students on the music technology and popular music degree course at Huddersfield University were awarded a First or a 2:1 this year - compared with 33 per cent five years ago. Similarly, all 25 students on the building services engineering course at Liverpool John Moores University were awarded a First or a 2:1 this year, compared with 61 per cent five years ago. And everyone studying English language and linguistics at the University of the West of England achieved a First or a 2:1, up from 71 per cent five years ago. All 31 students on the music technology and popular music degree course at Huddersfield University (pictured) were awarded a First or a 2:1 this year . Among the 40 universities that responded to freedom of information requests, 32 had degree courses where between 90 and 100 per cent of students were awarded a First or a 2:1 . As in previous years, elite institutions - including Oxford, Cambridge and University College London - had the highest number of courses recording between 90 and 100 per cent Firsts or 2:1s. The Higher Education Statistics Agency warned that where student numbers on courses are very low, a few individual results could skew the outcome. But the agency’s own data showed a record two-thirds of all students got either a First or a 2:1 in 2012. Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said that grade inflation had become ‘rampant’ because there were no national standards for degrees, and it enabled institutions to boost their rankings in league tables. Fellow Buckingham academic Professor Geoffrey Alderman said: ‘It is the “all must have prizes” approach.’ Birmingham University Professor John Thornes said grade inflation was a ‘marketing ploy’. But Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said: ‘There may be a range of factors behind these results. The number of students on many of the courses is small. The degrees in question also represent a fraction of the courses often available at individual universities. ‘The proportion of Firsts and 2:1s has increased marginally in recent years, reflecting increases in entry qualifications. A-level performance has improved, as have learning methods. However, the current degree classification system is a blunt instrument.’","More than 50 university courses across UK awarded students a First or 2:1 .

"Michael Gove's advisor has slammed England's schools, teachers and universities, arguing that children's 'genetics' decide how well a child does. Influential adviser Dominic Cummings claims in a withering thesis that educationists instead need to focus on how genetics affect children, and adapt education to suit a child's IQ. In a scathing attack, the adviser . criticises most of the education available to children in England today - . from pre-learning facilities, to GCSEs, to university study to how . education is researched. Michael Gove's aide Dominic Cummings has produced a withering report on the state of England's education . The political aide says the Department for Education should be cut down, with hundreds instead of thousands acting as accountants and inspectors, the Guardian reported. He also demands that private and state education should be indistinguishable, and the department should work to reduce the differences. Mr Cummings maintains that individual . child performance is mainly based on genetics and a child's IQ rather . than the quality of teaching. He argues that not only IQ but self-control and a conscientious character will shape a child's future. He says a scientific way needs to be developed to produce a more ambitious education and training system. The Cummings manifesto claims that 'the education of the majority even in rich countries is between awful and mediocre', and that the quality of maths education is especially poor. He also says that 'real talent' is rare among the nation's teacher. Educationists instead need to focus on how genetics affect children, and adapt education to suit children's IQ, Cummings claims . 'In England, few are well trained in . the basics of extended writing or mathematical and scientific modelling . and problemsolving,' he wrote. In . the 250-page document, he claims that education standards have . stagnated for the last 30 years and the actual research on education . needs to be vastly improved. It is not just teachers who are . heavily criticised - Mr Cummings says university undergraduates should . spend more time studying, and that the current demands are not taxing . enough. He also says that it . is reasonable to believe that GCSE exams have become easier, which is . why students have been earning top grades. The Sure Start programme, aimed at providing early learning for pre-school children, is slammed by Cummings, who says there is little evidence for its practical impact. The education adviser also claims that studies show children with little self-control are more likely to be poor, have serious health problems and be criminals. Under Labour Sure Start Children's Centres were established to provide early learning and full daycare for children under five. Sure Start Children's Centres are open to all parents and children and many of the services are free. But the advisor argues that there is little evidence to prove that they make a strong difference to a child's educational development. The adviser is leaving his role to reportedly become involved in free schools. He told The Independent he was uncertain of what exactly his next position would be, but was interested in pursuing other educational developments 'outside politics', the newspaper reported.","Dominic Cummings has produce withering report on England's education .

"Norway has become the latest country to consider stripping citizenship from extremists who travel abroad to fight jihad. The government said it was important to send 'a strong signal' to people thinking about leaving the country to join terror groups. It came as London Mayor Boris Johnson called for British citizens travelling to Iraq and Syria to join the Islamic State (ISIS) to be automatically stripped of their passports. In echoing that call, Norway's Minister of Children and Equality, Solveig Horne, said the government will 'turn over every stone' to prevent its citizens from becoming radicalised. 'Strong signal': Norway's Minister of Children and Equality, Solveig Horne (left), has echoed calls by London Mayor Boris Johnson (right) for extremists who travel abroad to fight jihad to be stripped of their citizenship . She told The Local: 'We will begin discussion about introducing regulations on revocation for any citizen causing serious damage to vital government interests or who has volunteered to serve in foreign military services. 'This is a strong signal to people wanting to take part in terror operations and wars.' Other countries, including Denmark and the Netherlands are looking at similar measures. Earlier this week, Mr Johnson said Britain must take on ISIS to 'try to close it down now', warning that doing nothing would mean a 'tide of terror will eventually lap at our own front door'. The mayor, who has overall responsibility for the Metropolitan Police, called for new laws that would mean anyone visiting Iraq and Syria would be automatically presumed to be terrorists unless they had notified the authorities in advance. The issue has been pulled into sharp . focus for many Western governments after the brutal killing of U.S. journalist James Foley by an Islamic State fighter dubbed 'jihadi John'. Sickening: Tackling extremism has been pulled into sharp focus for many Western governments after the brutal killing of U.S. journalist James Foley by an Islamic State fighter dubbed 'jihadi John' (above) Writing in his Daily Telegraph column, Mr Johnson said: ‘Young men such as this killer are famously told that if they die in ""battle"" they will be welcomed in heaven by the sexual ministrations of 72 virgins. ‘Many of them believe it - even though scholars have suggested that the reference to ""black-eyed virgins"" is in fact a promise of 72 raisins. 'I suspect most of us don't give a monkey's what happens to this prat in heaven, whether he meets virgins or raisins - we just want someone to come along with a bunker buster and effect an introduction as fast as possible.' However, he was roundly criticised for his comments. Richard Barrett, a former MI6 security chief, said the threat from ISIS was ‘unproven’ and needed to be better understood before new laws were rushed through. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg added that new legislation to combat the threat posed by British jihadists returning from the Middle East would not remove the danger from Islamic State extremists.","Norway says it will 'turn over every stone' to prevent radicalisation .

"Barack Obama has paved the way for airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria after spy planes started operating in the country on his command, according to U.S officials. While the White House says military action inside Syria has not yet been approved, additional intelligence on the militants is considered vital before any move can be made - especially in the northern city of Raqqa, which ISIS has named the capital of its self-declared caliphate. The move comes despite warnings from Syria's embattled president Bashar Assad that any airstrike in the country not given his express permission would be considered an act of aggression. Obama has so far sought a limited military campaign in neighbouring Iraq . focused on protecting American diplomats and Iraqi civilians under direct . threat from the brutal Islamist militant group. But officials have not ruled out escalating military action against ISIS, which has increased its overt threats . against the United States in recent weeks. Scroll down for video . Growth: . Demonstrators chant their support for ISIS - the brutal Islamist militant group deemed too extreme even by Al Qaeda. U.S. President Barack Obama has now paved the way for airstrikes on ISIS targets . Difficult decisions: President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, return to the White House with their daughter Malia on Sunday after his vacation in Martha's Vineyard . Pentagon officials have been drafting potential options for the type of action Obama may want to consider to counter ISIS. The plans include airstrikes against strategic targets. One official said the administration has a need for reliable intelligence from Syria and called the surveillance flights an important avenue for obtaining data on the group's size, firepower and the whereabouts of its leadership. The U.S. began launching strikes against ISIS inside Iraq earlier this month - with Obama citing the threat to American personnel in the country and a humanitarian crisis in the north as his rationale. But top Pentagon officials have said the only way to eliminate the militants - who have been branded too extreme even by notorious terrorist group Al Qaeda - is to go after the group inside Syria as well. Obama has long resisted taking military action in Syria - a step that would plunge the U.S. into a country already ravaged by an intractable civil war. However, the president's calculus appears to have shifted since ISIS announced last week that it had murdered James Foley - an American photojournalist who had been held hostage in Syria. The extremist group is also threatening to kill other U.S. citizens in its hands. Defiance: Despite admitting Syria would welcome outside help in the battle against ISIS, President Bashar Assad's regime said it would consider any unauthorized U.S. airstrike in the country an act of aggression . Expansion of airstrikes to Syria: A US Navy F/A-18 launches off from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush in the Persian Gulf waters on August 15 to strike ISIS positions in Iraq . White House spokesman Josh Earnest yesterday said that Obama has demonstrated his willingness to order military action whenever it is deemed necessary to protect American citizens. 'That is true without regard to international boundaries,' he added. The White House would not comment on Obama's decision to authorize surveillance flights over Syria yesterday, but a spokesperson speaking on condition of anonymity today said they had begun. The U.S. stepped up its air surveillance of ISIS inside Iraq earlier this year as Obama began considering the prospect of airstrikes there. And the administration has already run some surveillance missions over Syria - including ahead of an attempted mission to rescue Foley and other U.S. hostages earlier this summer. The . U.S. special forces who were sent into Syria to carry out the rescue . mission did not find the hostages at the location where the military . thought they were being held. Officials who confirmed the failed rescue . last week said the U.S. was continuing to seek out intelligence on the . other hostages' whereabouts. Threat: General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said of ISIS: 'This is an organization that has an apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated' Administration . officials have said a concern for Obama in seeking to take out ISIS inside Syria is the prospect that such a move could . unintentionally help Assad. Yesterday a top . Syrian official said any U.S. airstrike without consent will be considered aggression. ISIS is among the rebel groups seeking Assad's ouster - along with other forces aided by the U.S. The . White House yesterday tried to tamp down the notion that action against ISIS could bolster Assad, with Earnest saying, 'We're not . interested in trying to help the Assad regime.' However, he acknowledged . that 'there are a lot of cross pressures here.' 'With . Central Command, [Dempsey] is preparing options to address ISIS both in . Iraq and Syria with a variety of military tools including airstrikes,' Colonel Ed Thomas said. 'The bottom line is that our forces are well postured to partner with regional allies against ISIS.' Escalation: U.S. Journalist James Wright Foley and member of the Islamist militant group ISIS speak to the camera before he is brutally executed. His death appears to changed Obama's stance on military action . A U.S. official said Washington was also preparing to launch intelligence and . surveillance flights, including drones, over Syria. Two . other U.S. officials also acknowledged the preparation of strike . options against ISIS in Syria, with one saying planning had . been under way for weeks. Still, neither official suggested U.S. military action there was imminent. 'We're just not there yet,' said a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of the anonymity.

"A New York woman said she was left shaking after finding a letter inside a Saks Fifth Avenue shopping bag purportedly written by a man in a Chinese prison factory that was mass-producing the distinctive carry-all. Stephanie Wilson, 28, an Australian who lives in Harlem, said she found the message while reaching into the bad for a receipt and it said 'HELP HELP HELP'. The desperate cry was written in blue ink on white-lined paper and included a passport-sized photo of a man - who called himself Tohnain Emmanuel Njong - in an orange jacket, as well as a Yahoo email address. 'I read the letter and I just shook - I couldn't believe what I was reading,' Wilson said in an interview with DNAinfo New York. Desperate cry: New York-based Australian expat Stephanie Wilson, 28, found this letter hidden within her Saks Fifth Avenue shopping bag, purportedly from a man who was enslaved in a prison factory that was mass-producing the bags in China. The department store have since confirmed they make the bags in the country, but have not said where . The note said: 'We are ill-treated and work like slaves for 13 hours every day producing these bags in bulk in the prison factory. Thanks and sorry to bother you.' Wilson said she found it in September 2012 after buying a pair of Hunter rain boots and passed it on to the Laogai Research Foundation - a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group founded to fight human rights abuses in Chinese prisons - who began investigating. But Njong's Yahoo email address bounced back, so the nonprofit was unable to locate him. Harry Wu, the founder of Laogai Research Foundation, spent 19 years in a Chinese prison factory, known as laogai., and that Njong took a huge risk both writing and sending it. 'There would be solitary confinement until you confess and maybe later they increase your sentence - or even death,' Wu said. His organization referred the letter to the Department of Homeland Security, which investigates allegations of American companies using forced labor to make their products. Homeland Security officials confirmed to DNAinfo that they were made aware of the letter, but could not say if they investigated it or are currently looking at Saks in connection to it. A DHS official said it's not the first plea letter from China that has ended up on American shores. According to DHS senior policy adviser Kenneth Kennedy, the department was made aware of a woman in Oregon who made international news in 2012 when she discovered a similar letter detailing abuse and grueling labor in a Chinese prison when it fell from a Halloween decoration she'd bought at Kmart. The Oregon letter was anonymous, though The New York Times later tracked down the man who said he wrote it. Distinctive: The black and white Saks Fifth Ave bags are commonplace in New York and Los Angeles. The department store have confirmed they have them made in China and investigating the claims made in the letter . A representative for Saks Fifth Avenue confirmed that the store was notified of the letter by the Laogai Research Foundation in December 2013 and said the company took the allegation seriously and launched an investigation. Saks also confirmed to DNAinfo that the store's shopping bags are made in China, but didn't have any further information. Two U.S. laws make it illegal for imported products to be made using slave, convict or indentured labor. DNAinfo managed to track down a man who claimed to be Njong, admitted to writing the letter and knew specific details about what was in it. He said he wrote the letter during his three-year prison sentence in the eastern city of Qingdao, Shandong Province. Njong said he a wrote a total of five letters while in the prison, some in French that he hid in bags emblazoned with French words, and others in English. Njong, who is now 34, said he had been teaching English in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen when he was arrested in May 2011 and charged with fraud, a crime he said he never committed. He said he was held in a detention center for 10 months while awaiting a government-sponsored lawyer and was barred from contact with the outside community. Njong said each prisoner was required to meet a daily production quota of what they working on - bet it shopping bags, electronics or sewing garments - and that they were given a pen and paper to record their productivity. This is what he used to pen the letters, hiding under his covers at night so no one would see. Njong's family did not know where he was for the whole time he was prison, because he was not permitted to contact anyone following his arrest. He said he was discharged from prison in December 2013 after receiving a sentence cut for good behavior and finally reunited with relatives, who presumed him dead. After struggling to find work in his home country, Njong recently moved to Dubai and secured a job that will allow him to stay there. He said that though his imprisonment ran its course without intervention, he was happy that his letter made its way into at least one person's hands. 'It was the biggest surprise of my life,' Njong told DNAinfo. 'I am just happy that someone heard my cry.'","Stephanie Wilson, 28, found the letter in September 2012 after purchasing boots at Saks Fifth Avenue .

"Cindy McCain had some choice words for Gwyneth Paltrow on Twitter Wednesday after the actress used a surprise  appearance at a tech conference to compare celebrities ridiculed on the internet to the plight of soldiers going through war. Paltrow was outside Los Angeles at Re/Code's Code Conference speaking to Silicon Valley big wigs Tuesday when she made the offhanded remark that has former POW John McCain's wife, who's also mother to two soldiers, so livid. 'Gwyneth Paltrow is a joke,' McCain balked Wednesday night. 'Her life is like taking bullets for a soldier. What a joke! My 2 sons serving in the military should talk to her.' A military mom's wrath: Cindy McCain, wife of ex-POW Senator John McCain and mother to two soldiers (left), has come out swinging over Gwyneth Paltrow's (right) suggestion that actors ridiculed on the internet are like soldiers at war . Not holding back: McCain's tweets came after Paltrow's comments while speaking at a tech conference. She's was surprisingly uncensored for a politician's wife . The row began with the following comment Paltrow made onstage while discussing internet comments about the stars: . 'You come across them about yourself and about your friends, and it's a very dehumanizing thing. It's almost like how, in war, you go through this bloody, dehumanizing thing, and then something is defined out of it. My hope is, as we get out of it, we'll reach the next level of conscience,' she said. It was a small part of what she said while sharing a stage with tech CEOs, but was more than enough to infuriate the war hero's wife. Arizona Senator and former presidential hopeful John McCain was was taken as a prisoner of war as the third generation naval officer served as a pilot in Vietnam in 1967. Senator McCain's plane was shot down by friendly fire and he would eventually spend five and a half years as an horifically abused prisoner before coming home to receive the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Purple Hear and Distinguished Flying Cross military honors. Cindy McCain on Wednesday offered up a helpful suggestion to the Country Strong actress and self-styled lifestyle guru. 'Perhaps . Gwyneth Paltrow should go out on patrol with some soldiers. Kind of . like a Red Carpet in her mind I guess!' she tweeted. While the Goop founder's appearance at the conference was a reaction to malevolent online attacks on her and her famous friends, any good it could have done has likely now been erased. Which is nothing new for the recently single Paltrow. A . week before news of her 'conscious uncoupling' from husband Chris . Martin broke, the 41-year-old infuriated working women across America . when she said they had it easier than famous acting moms. Family affair: McCain's fury was fueled by the fact that her sons John (left) and James (with McCain at right) are both military men . She had her reasons: John McCain, pictured here with Mrs. McCain at an Arizona Diamondbacks game this month, was an horrifically abused prisoner of war in Vietnam for five and a half years . 'I think it's different when you have an office job, because it's routine and, you know, you can do all the stuff in the morning and then you come home in the evening,' she told E! 'I think to have a regular job and be a mom is not as, of course there are challenges, but it's not like being on set.' Many women were put off by the comments, but none as famously as mother Mackenzie Dawson who made headlines with her open letter to Paltrow published in the New York Post on March 27. 'Thank God I don’t make millions filming one movie per year is what I say to myself pretty much every morning,' is one of many zingers in Dawson letter, which no doubt helped put the normally aloof Paltrow on the defensive. On May 8th, she responded to the anger over her working mom comments with a Goop in which she drew a different sort of parallel with armed combat. Co-parent: Gwyneth's estranged husband Chris Martin - who she recently separated with after 11 years of marriage - returned to Los Angeles on Thursday, where they still share a home together . In the post titled Ending the Mommy Wars, Paltrow wrote: . 'Why do we feel so entitled to opine, often so negatively, on the choices of other women? As the mommy wars rage on, I am constantly perplexed and amazed by how little slack we cut each other as women,' she wrote.

"Thousands of middle-class pupils have been put off going to university by the increase in tuition fees to as much as £9,000 a year. Demand for places this autumn has fallen most sharply among sixth-formers from middle and higher-income homes following the near-trebling of fees from £3,375. Most fail to qualify for grants, bursaries or fee discounts and must . take out the maximum available loan to cover fees and living costs. Just over 50,000 fewer students have applied to start degree courses from September, compared to the same point last year, according to the latest UCAS statistics. Figures published yesterday by the Universities and Colleges Admissions . Service reveal how 15,000 18-year-olds in England have been deterred by . higher tuition fees. The vast majority are from families earning at . least £30,000 a year. The figures suggest they are deciding in greater numbers to bypass . university and use their A-level results to look for jobs to avoid . building up predicted £40,000 debts. The number of UK university . applicants has fallen 8.9 per cent – or 50,339 – following news that . universities will impose higher charges this autumn. In England, with . fees considerably higher than in other home nations, demand plunged 10 . per cent. Older students have deserted higher education in greatest numbers, with lesser falls among 18-year-old school leavers. Drop: Overall applications, from both home and abroad, are down 7.7 per cent this year . Analysis accompanying the figures reveals that the percentage of . 18-year-olds applying from the poorest fifth of families in England has . dipped slightly, from 19 per cent in 2011 to 18.8 per cent. These . students’ families earn up to £15,000 before tax. Among households earning up to £30,000, the proportion of applicants dropped 0.7 points to 26.5 per cent. Demand dipped more sharply among  middle-income families earning between . £30,000 and £50,000, falling 1.1 points to 32.8 per cent. Among . higher-earners, with household incomes of £50,000 to £75,000, the . proportion of applicants dropped 2.1 points to 40.7 per cent. And among . the richest fifth of families in England, earning at least £75,000, . demand slid 2.6 points to 53.7 per cent. ‘The application rates for young people from all backgrounds have fallen . in 2012 with the largest declines for those from the most advantaged . backgrounds,’ the report said. Overall, one in 20 18-year-olds in England who would have been expected to apply to university this year has failed to do so. In contrast, in the other UK nations where fee levels are unchanged on . last year, application rates ‘continue on trend’. The Mail reported . yesterday how students from  middle-income families are expected to . graduate with the most debt – £43,585 – according to research by the . Institute for Fiscal Studies. They are also less likely to be eligible . for grants after the qualifying income level was reduced from £50,695 to . £42,600. UCAS chief executive Mary Curnock Cook said: ‘This in-depth analysis of . the 2012 applications data shows that, although there has been a . reduction in application rates where tuition fees have increased, there . has not been a disproportionate effect on more disadvantaged groups.’ The UCAS analysis presents tentative evidence that sixth-formers are . more likely to apply to the most prestigious universities following the . reforms, and choose courses which bring higher estimated graduate . salaries. Many arts courses saw a decline in popularity while the . sciences held up well. Universities Minister David Willetts said: ‘The proportion of English . school leavers applying to university is the second highest on record . and people are still applying. This will still be a competitive year as . people continue to understand that university remains a good long-term investment for their future.’","From September tuition fees in English universities will triple to £9,000 .
9% fewer students have applied to start degree courses compared to last year .
In England applications have slumped 10 per cent, a bigger fall than Wales and Scotland ."
"Attack: Sir Antony Jay worked as a BBC producer before writing the hit comedy Yes Minister . The co-creator of Yes Minister has launched a blistering attack on the BBC – saying it is biased on issues such as climate change. Sir Antony Jay, who worked as a BBC producer before writing the hit comedy, called for a dramatic downsizing of the corporation, saying it had simply become too powerful. In an attack on his former paymasters, he said he would scrap all its radio stations except Radio 4, and all TV stations other than BBC One. And he claimed that the values of the organisation were opposed to the principle of private profit and the monarchy. Sir Antony was speaking at the launch of a report by the Global Warming Policy Foundation, which claims the BBC is biased over climate change. ‘If you believe in a free country and a free press, why do we have a state broadcasting system at all?’ he said. ‘Or why do we not have a state newspaper with £4billion spent on it and associated magazines all published by the state? ‘Why is the BBC so huge, why does in dominate the nation’s communication? ‘It is the biggest communications organisation in the world.’ He went on: ‘I do think it does some very good things and I’m not actually in favour of abolishing it – not at the moment anyway. I do ask why it dominates the media so much. ‘Why do we not simply have one BBC television channel, one speech radio channel – what more do we need?’ This week he wrote the foreword for a report on climate change bias in the BBC. Hit cast: Yes Minister stars Derek Fowlds, Nigel Hawthorne and Paul Eddington . 'Too powerful': Si Antony Jay said the Corporation should be downsized . On Thursday, he said that when he was there, BBC people tended to be anti-industry and saw private profit as distasteful. Many were anti-monarchy, and were suspicious of the Army. He said: ‘What I have noticed is that it comes down to values, and the hardest thing to change in an organisation is its values. ‘And these values are behind the BBC’s view on global warming, which is everything the BBC didn’t like – it was about industry, profit, big corporations and that sort of thing.’ Sir Antony said the BBC would not be as large as it is if the broadcasting landscape had been designed now, rather than in the 1920s. In the foreword he wrote to the Global Warming Policy Foundation’s report, he developed his theme of a slimmed-down BBC. He wrote: ‘All its other mass of activities – publishing, websites, orchestras, digital channels, music and local radio stations – could be disposed of without any noticeable loss to the cultural life of the country, and the licence fee could probably be cut by two thirds. Could it happen? ‘As the economic squeeze tightens, the case for a drastic slimming down of the BBC gets stronger every day. Cash-strapped households might be glad of the extra £100 a year.’ Sir Antony admitted that when he was a BBC staffer, he ‘absorbed and expressed all the accepted BBC attitudes: hostility to, or at least suspicion of, America, monarchy, government, capitalism, empire, banking and the defence establishment; and in favour of the Health Service, state welfare, the social sciences, the environment and state education’. Yes Minister and sequel Yes, Prime Minister, which Sir Antony wrote with Jonathan Lynn, were hits in the 1980s and a particular favourite of Margaret Thatcher. They follow the ministerial career of Jim Hacker, played by Paul Eddington, and also star Sir Nigel Hawthorne and Derek Fowlds. Sir Antony worked as a BBC producer and editor in the 1950s and 1960s, where he established the Tonight programme.","Corporation has become 'too powerful' and should be downsized, says Sir Antony Jay ."
"A 22-year-old has given birth to a healthy baby girl who grew outside her womb. The woman, in Tanzania, only discovered when she was 32 weeks pregnant that her baby was developing in her abdomen. It is thought that the fertilised egg initially implanted in her fallopian tube from where it was expelled, allowing it to implant again in her abdomen. A 22-year-old has given birth to a healthy baby that grew outside her womb, in her abdomen (file picture) The woman was referred to a hospital in Mwanza, Tanzania, after complaining of abdominal pain and noticing that her baby was not moving very much. She also reported having difficulty urinating, according to a report of her case in the journal BioMed Central. She had already had two antenatal check-ups after which she was told the pregnancy was progressing normally. She had an ultrasound scan in Mwanza which appeared to be normal and doctors assumed the pregnancy was textbook but that the mother had anaemia and a urinary tract infection. An abdominal pregnancy is a form of ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies occur when a fertilised egg implants outside the womb - usually in the fallopian tubes, but occasionally in the abdomen. Abdominal pregnancies usually occur as a result of a fallopian tube rupturing or expelling a fertilised egg that has first implanted in the tube. Unlike with other ectopic . pregnancies, there is a chance that a viable baby will be born following . an abdominal pregnancy but there is also an increased risk of the . mother dying. Abdominal pregnancies are thought to account for about one in every 10,000 pregnancies. But they are dangerous as they can cause severe bleeding in the . mother. A woman with an abdominal pregnancy will not be able to give birth naturally and the baby will have to be delivered surgically. If this does not happen, the baby will die and can become calcified inside the mother. Babies born after abdominal pregnancies . have a high rate of birth defects because they can be compressed as a . result of there being no amniotic fluid as a protective buffer. They treated her for these conditions and her symptoms eased a little. However, a second scan two days later showed that the woman’s baby was actually floating in her abdominal cavity. The patient was found to be carrying a viable baby even though it was not in a protective amniotic sac and was not surrounded by the normal amniotic fluid. She was also noted to have a normal, but empty, womb and normal ovaries and fallopian tubes. The baby was successfully delivered during surgery. The little girl weighed 3lbs 7oz (1.7kg). The mother had to be given a blood transfusion because she had severe anaemia but she and the baby were both discharged from hospital healthy. Abdominal pregnancies are rare forms of ectopic pregnancies which occur when the baby implants in the abdomen instead of the womb. They are often not picked up on ultrasound scans and usually occur as a result of a fallopian tube rupturing or expelling a fertilised egg that has implanted in the tube.

'I've seen maybe four or five abdominal pregnancies over the course of 25 years,' Dr Jill Rabin, chief of ambulatory care, obstetrics and gynecology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New York, told Live Science. She added: 'It's very rare, but you have to keep it in your mind when examining a pregnant woman who has abdominal pain.'","The woman, in Tanzania, went to hospital with stomach pain at 32 weeks .

"Those who love them praise their 'mild nutty taste' and 'crunch' but for most diners the thought eating insects might prove to be one culinary step too far. Adventurous visitors at a Belgian food fair were treated to unusual offerings such as buffalo worm burgers, pan-fried crickets and bugs served with chocolate sauce. The EAT! Brussels food event showcased meals made with the creepy critters, highlighting companies  who have embarked on food ventures with buffalo worms, house crickets and mealworms. Scroll down for video. Pan-fried crickets with melon: Visitors at the EAT! Brussels food fair were served insects and worms . Worm nuggets served with a side of salad now appears on Brussels' Vrije Universiteit's cafeteria menu . One such entrepreneur is Belgian cricket breeder Little Food, who supplies the critters to gourmet restaurants, praising their 'mild nutty taste' and 'crunch'. The company suggest serving the insects with soy sauce and mushrooms, or on chocolate. Ms Nicky Deneef, from Waterloo, was unfazed by the taste as the company promoted their product at the event. 'It's okay, it's really good in fact,' she said after popping one of the creatures in her mouth. Little Food says the cricket contains three times as much protein as beef, along with a wide range of vitamins, minerals and fatty acids. On top of health benefits, insects are seen as a solution to meet the demands of food supply and are viewed as a more environmentally-friendly method of food production. Wriggly additions: Mealworms getting ready to be processed into sauces and spreads at Green Kow . Insect spreads on offer include savoury carrot, or tomato as well as sweet chocolate . This spurred Damien Huysmans to found Green Kow, which prides itself on being the first in Europe to offer products containing mealworms to be distributed in regular stores. A range of mealworm-based spreads are on offer - from savoury carrot or tomato to sweet chocolate. Huysmans said he wanted to be a part of the buzz surrounding insect food. Mr Huysmans said to Reuters: 'We have heard a lot of people talking about insects as the food of the future, because it's great for the environment, from a nutritional point of view and for the taste as well it's got something to bring at a gastronomical level. 'And we quite simply said to ourselves, 'Ok, if it's that great, we'll start now then. We'll get going right away,'' he said. Bugs on chocolate: Insect-based food products are now creeping into Belgian kitchens . Belgian supermarket Delhaize started stocking Green Kow's Green Bugs in September . Belgian supermarket Delhaize started stocking their product Green Bugs in September, expanding Green Kow's sale of mealworms beyond organic and natural food stores. Not everyone, however, was convinced by the prospect of stocking their fridges with bugs. 'I look at them, but I'm afraid of the texture of the product. It's not the flavor. I'm not afraid of the taste of the product, but I'm afraid of the texture of the product,' shopper Renee-Claude Charton said in the video. Students at a Brussels-based university have taken more warmly to insects after the canteen introduced a buffalo worm burger in October, becoming the first commercial kitchen in Belgium to serve the product. Apprehensive: Some diners remain unconvinced, saying that they are afraid of the texture of the products . The burger, produced by Belgian food producer Damhert, was so successful at Brussels' Vrije Universiteit (VUB)'s cafeteria that worm nuggets were on offer two weeks later. Gert Venken, a political science student at the university, was happy to tuck in to both the nuggets and the burger. 'People find that perhaps gross, but it's as gross to eat animals' livers. Some people eat all the parts of pigs and cows. Why would this then be gross? I think it's all edible and has been tested. For me, it's not gross. It doesn't scare me,' he said. Insects will remain on the university's menu for the foreseeable future, with the cafeteria saying it planned to serve them every two to three weeks. Belgium was one of the first European countries to issue national guidelines concerning the sale of insects as food in 2013.","Visitors at the EAT!

"If the woman in your life woke up grumpy this morning, don’t be too hard on her. It is, apparently, only natural. Scientists have discovered  that women need more sleep than men. And chances are, she’s not getting enough. In fact the best thing a loving husband or partner can do is perhaps persuade her to get a few extra hours snuggling under the duvet. Or face the consequences. Researchers in the U.S. found that women suffer more than men, both mentally and physically, if they are forced to go without sufficient sleep . Scientists say women suffer more than men, both mentally and physically, if they are forced to skimp on their sleep. As well as a higher risk of heart disease, depression and psychological problems, sleep-deprived women have extra clotting factors in their blood, which can lead to a stroke. They also have higher inflammation markers, which indicate developing health problems. As inflammation markers are also linked to pain, sleep expert Dr Michael Breus explained that women can literally be in more pain when they wake up. That’s enough to make any girl feel rather grumpy. By contrast, the state of a man’s health does not appear to be closely linked to how much he sleeps. In the study, carried out by scientists at Duke University in North Carolina, men showed no increased risk of developing the ailments that affect women when they are losing sleep. According to Dr Breus, sleep-deprived women are angrier, more hostile and more aggressive . ‘We found that women had more depression, women had more anger, and women had more hostility early in the morning,’ said Dr Breus.  If this sounds like someone you know, it can probably be blamed on sleep deprivation and the fact that women are particularly susceptible to the effects. What does Dr Breus advise? If you don’t manage to  get enough sleep at night, try taking strategic naps. However, he warned that those naps should be either 25 minutes or 90 minutes long. Any other length will make the snoozer feel worse when they wake, he said. This is not the first time experts have suggested that women need more sleep than men. One of Britain’s leading authorities on sleep found that women actually need 20 minutes more shut-eye. This is because of the female multi-tasking brain. ‘One of the major functions of sleep is to allow the brain to recover and repair itself,’ said Professor Jim Horne, director of the Sleep Research Centre at Loughborough University. ‘During deep sleep, the cortex – the part of the brain responsible for thought, memory, language and so on – disengages from the senses and goes into recovery mode. ‘The more of your brain you use during the day, the more of it that needs to recover and, consequently, the more sleep you need. ‘Women tend to multi-task – they do lots at once and are flexible – and so they use more of their actual brain than men do. Because of that, their sleep need is greater. ‘A man who has a complex job that involves a lot of decision-making and lateral thinking may also need more sleep than the average male  –  though probably still not as much as a woman.’","Women are more angry and hostile if they get insufficient sleep, say North Carolina scientists .
Sleep deprivation also increases women's risk of heart disease, stroke and depression .
But a man's health is barely affected by lack of sleep ."
"Republicans today quoted a little-noticed December 2013 federal court ruling as evidence of a 'catch and release' immigration policy that the Obama administration uses to encourage a flood of illegal migrants to the U.S. from the south. One congressman told MailOnline on Tuesday that Federal Judge Andrew S. Hanen called out the Obama administration for aiding and abetting felonies. And a former lawmaker wrote that the decision shows how the White House is rolling out the welcome mat for human traffickers. As many as 80,000 children, many traveling with human traffickers but without their parents, are expected to cross the southern U.S. border illegally in 2014. He wrote in the case of a 10-year-old Salvadoran girl smuggled in the the United States that the Department of Homeland security is essentially 'delivering the minors to the custody of the parent illegally living in the United States' – even when Border Patrol agents arrest the 'coyotes' who sneak them in. 'These actions are both dangerous and unconscionable,' Hanen wrote. 'The DHS has simply chosen not to enforce the United States' border security laws.' Traveling alone: 14-year-old Brian Duran from Comayagua, Honduras, came to the U.S.-Mexico border by himself, reacting to false claims that young immigrant children can be reunited with family members in the U.S. Buses carrying children have been pouring into a border patrol facility in Nogales, Arizona, with authorities rushing to staff and supply makeshift holding facilities for all the minors who turn up in border sweeps . Last week photos leaked from a temporary detention facility in Texas showed hundreds of children crammed into holding rooms, without their parents, as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents processed them. After they're fingerprinted and given case numbers, most are turned over to other government agencies or released outright to parents who have no legal basis for being in the U.S. And . 'since most border violators are not caught, the actual numbers . arriving presumably are far larger,' former Oklahoma Republican . congressman Ernest Istook wrote Tuesday in a Washington Times essay. Critics say the Obama administration is turning an already porous border into a sieve on purpose. 'This is a crisis of the federal government’s creation,' Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said in a statement, 'and the fact that the border remains unsecure – now apparently intentionally - while this operation continues full-steam ahead is deplorable.' 'Judge Hanen’s order is a must-read for everyone trying to understand the roots of today’s ""humanitarian crisis"" of children being smuggled into the U.S.,' he added. 'When more people learn the truth, they will hold President Obama accountable [for] ... creating human tragedy and suffering.' Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar, a Republican whose state is housing hundreds of illegal immigrant children in a makeshift holding facility in the town of Nogales, told MailOnline that Hanen 'issued an astute, neutral and accurate decision on the gross incompetence and potential illegal activities engaged in by the federal government.' 'When I first learned that the federal government was opening the Texas border and allowing thousands of illegal aliens into the country, and then transporting them across state lines only to abandon them destitute, homeless and dependent, I believed then this constituted a felony – alien smuggling and human trafficking,' Gosar explained in an email. 'Judge Hanen agrees ... finding that the DHS has in fact been a criminal participant in human trafficking.' Rep. Phil Gingrey, a Georgia Republican, told MailOnline that 'the Obama administration has acknowledged the surging number of children crossing the border illegally,' but 'by failing to enforce current immigration laws, its policies have only exacerbated the crisis.' 'President Obama’s non-enforcement doctrine has perpetuated illegal border crossing – without fear of reprisal – and encourages risking children’s lives to illegally cross the border,' said Gingrey. Overflowing: The shelter at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas can no longer accommodate large numbers of children and mothers traveling with their kids, forcing the federal government to open more facilities and move many to Nogales for processing . Many of the children appear to be teenagers but some clearly are younger . Hanen's . scathing ruling documented a guilty plea from human trafficker Mirtha . Veronica Nava-Martinez, who was paid to bring the 10-year-old girl to . Virginia but never got past a checkpoint in Brownsville, Texas. She was . already a felon convicted of food stamp fraud in 2011. The . girl's mother, Patricia Elizabeth Salmeron Santos, lives illegally in . Virginia. She paid Nava-Martinez to fetch her daughter and smuggler her . across the border. 'Salmeron Santos admitted that she started this conspiracy by hiring alien smugglers to transfer her child from El Salvador to Virginia,' Hanen wrote. 'She agreed to pay $8500 (and actually paid $6,000 in advance) for these human traffickers to smuggle her daughter). 'The criminal conspiracy instigated by Salmeron Santos was temporarily interrupted when Nava-Martinez was arrested,' but '[d]espite this setback, the goal of the conspiracy was successfully completed thanks to the United States Government.' Salmeron Santo, he notes, was never the subject of any criminal proceedings. DHS 'did not arrest her. It did not prosecute her. It did not even initiate deportation proceedings for her,' Hanen wrote. It is 'completing the criminal mission of individuals who are violating the border security of the United States.' Those criminal missions include drug-smuggling plots: Mexican and South American narcotics cartels control much of the human trafficking, using both the coyotes and their immigrant cargo as drug mules during crossings. 'The irony, says Istook, 'is that the White House claims the children are fleeing the dangers of organized crime in Central America – the very organized crime being trusted and paid to transport them to the U.S. President Obama, he claims, 'denounces the situation as a ""humanitarian crisis"" as though he were not a perpetrator in creating it.' Status unknown: Maria Eva Casco, left, and her son Christian Casco of El Salvador, were arrested in Texas but later released and transported to a bus station in Arizona . 'When more people learn the truth, they will hold President Obama accountable ,' insists Rep. Paul Gosar, whose home state of Arizona has become overrun by children crossing the U.S.-Mexican border . Obama . himself likely sparked the mass migration from Central America and Mexico, . according to former New Jersey Superior Court Judge Andrew Napolitano. Napolitano said Monday night on the Fox News Channel that . 'the president of the United States personally and directly caused this . with a telephone and a pen,' referring to Obama's favorite aphorism for . 'executive actions' that he has taken without the say-so of Congress. The . president flexed his pen in 2012 with a high-profile order that relaxed . deportations for potentially millions of illegal immigrants who were . brought to the U.S. as children before June 2007. But news reports indicate that human traffickers are purposely misinterpreting Obama's action, telling families in Central America that the rule applies to them. Nora Griselda Bercian Diaz, a mother who crossed the border illegally with her six-year-old daughter, told KRGV-TV in south Texas that the message being disseminated in Guatemala is, 'go to America with your child, you won't be turned away.' Spark: President Obama announced in June 2012 that he was relaxing deportation for people who came to the U.S. illegally as children before 2007 -- but human traffickers are telling Third World children that the new rule will apply to them . 'Word has gotten out,' National Border Patrol Council local vice president Chris Cabrera told The New York Times, 'that we’re giving people permission and walking them out the door' after they're processed. 'So they’re coming across in droves.' The White House has carefully disputed the idea that Obama's 2012 amnesty proposal, which he extended on June 5, is to blame. 'We have heard sort of rumors and reports, or suggestions, that the increase may be in response to the perception that children would be allowed to stay or that immigration reform would in some way benefit these children,' White House Domestic Policy Council director  Cecilia Muñoz told reporters during a conference call on Monday. 'It seems to be quite clear that what is driving this is what’s happening in their home countries.' But immigrants sneaking into America seem pre-armed with expectations about how the Obama administration will welcome them. If you make it, they take you to a shelter and take care of you and let you have permission to stay,' 13-year-old Robin Tulio told the Times after he was apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. 'When you appeal your case, if you say you want to study, they support you.' Jeh Johnson, the newly minted Homeland Security secretary, announced the two-year extension of Obama's mini-amnesty program on Thursday. 'Despite the acrimony and partisanship that now exists in Washington, almost all of us agree that a child who crossed our border illegally with a parent, or in search of a parent or a better life, was not making an adult choice to break our laws,' Johnson said, 'and should be treated differently than adult law-breakers.'","Federal Judge Andrew S.

"Experts were unable to open the 9th century Carolingian pot (pictured), which was found on church land in Dumfries and Galloway in September . The mystery surrounding the contents of a Viking pot has been solved after researchers carried out a CT scan on the ancient artefact. Archaeologists had been unable to open the pot to see what was inside, but its weight suggested it was full of treasure. After undergoing a series of scans, the 1,200-year-old pot was found to contain up to at least five silver brooches and an ornate bead. It was among more than 100 objects discovered by metal detectorist Derek McLennan, 47 in Dumfries in September. Other items include solid gold jewellery, arm bands and silver ingots. The find was deemed one of the most significant Viking hoards ever discovered in the UK, but the pot's contents were a mystery. Experts were concerned about damaging the 9th century Carolingian pot when attempting to see what was inside. But now, the CT scanner at Borders General Hospital, Scotland, has revealed the ornate box contains around 20 silver, gold and ivory items. Mr McLennan, a retired businessman, said the latest discovery was ‘beautiful and exciting’. ‘It brought it all back to me when I saw what was inside the pot,’ he continued. ‘I was like a kid looking in the sweet shop window unable to touch anything being on the other side of the glass. ‘Nothing else had been on my mind for two-and-half-months than seeing what was inside the pot, and then seeing it, there was a rush of emotion and was incredibly exciting. ‘I was absolutely amazed by what was inside the pot. There seems to be 20 plus artefacts in the pot, while most of them seem to be broaches of some sort. ‘It’s a real mishmash of artefacts. Not everything comes across clear as there are different types of metal in there. ‘There is hopefully something beautiful and exciting to look at when it comes out because [the owner] took the time to wrap these items. ‘I’m now waiting on the pot to be emptied, but I understand these things take time and it’s in the hands of the experts.’ Experts used a CT scanner to inspect what is inside the Viking pot. The circular shape in the upper right corner is said to be an ornate bead. The dome object to its left is a bone or ivory bead, and the  coil curling from the bottom left to the centre is five brooches. But the rectangular shape at the centre remains a mystery . Derek McLennan, who found the trove, was approached by Richard Welander, head of collections with Historic Scotland, who was aware of the previous use of the hospital’s CT scanner for research. With the permission of hospital chief, the pot was brought in for an evening scanning session (pictured) A scan of the Carolingian pot was conducted by Dr John Reid, consultant radiographer at the BGH, who is also a keen amateur archaeologist. He was approached by Richard Welander, head of collections with Historic Scotland, who was aware of the previous use of the hospital’s CT scanner for archaeological research. With the permission of hospital chief Calum Campbell, the pot was brought in for an evening scanning session. ‘This work takes place outwith normal hours and in no way impedes the important work we do for our human patients,' said Dr Reid. ‘The scanner is both rapid and accurate, with the ability to produce 120 visual slices, and is accurate to within half a millimetre.’ The monitoring screen revealed the presence of five silver broaches, smaller gold ingots and ivory beads coated with gold - all wrapped in an organic material, possibly leather. Dr Reid added: ‘The conservationists did not want to [grope] about and compromise this precious object.' The protected pot is shown being scanned in Borders General Hospital. The CT scanner consists of an X-ray tube that rotates around the object. These rays are received by a detector on the opposite side of the object, and an image of the scan is created. It produces 120 visual 'slices', and is accurate to within half a millimetre . The discovery was made on Church of Scotland land in Dumfries, however, the exact location has not been revealed because the Scottish Government, Treasure Trove Unit and Historic Scotland have to make sure its properly protected while the full historical significance of the site is established . The discovery was made in early September by Mr McLennan. Fellow metal detectorists Reverend Dr David Bartholomew, who is a Church of Scotland minister of a rural Galloway charge, and Mike Smith, the pastor of an Elim Pentecostal Church in Galloway were also in the vicinity at the time. Rev Dr Bartholomew said: 'We were searching elsewhere when Derek initially thought he'd discovered a Viking gaming piece. ‘A short time later he ran over to us waving a silver arm-ring and shouting 'Viking'! It was tremendously exciting, especially when we noticed the silver cross lying face-downwards. ‘It was poking out from under the pile of silver ingots and decorated arm-rings, with a finely wound silver chain still attached to it. The discovery was made in early September by Mr McLennan. Fellow metal detectorists Reverend Dr David Bartholomew, who is a Church of Scotland minister of a rural Galloway charge, and Mike Smith, the pastor of an Elim Pentecostal Church in Galloway were also in the vicinity at the time. It was made on Church of Scotland land, but the exact location hasn't been revealed. The hoard also includes various brooches, ingots and this gold bird pin . The hoard, which consists of more than a hundred artefacts, many of which are historically unique, is now under the care of the Treasure Trove Unit and is regarded as being of significant international importance. Within the find is an early Christian solid silver cross from the 9th or 10th centuries. The cross is engraved with decorations that, experts say, are highly unusual, which Mr McLennan believes may represent the four Gospels - Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. It was found among dozens of silver arm-rings and ingots two feet below the surface. The excavation was undertaken by Andrew Nicholson, the county archaeologist, and, shortly after, Mr McLennan found a second signal at its base. Further investigations uncovered a second level trove which is of considerably higher quality than the first. It includes possibly the largest silver pot from the Carolingian dynasty discovered, which could be up to 1,200-years-old. Other finds include a gold ring, and a gold bird pin. The hoard falls under the Scots law of treasure trove, and is currently in the care of the Treasure Trove Unit. The discovery was made in early September by retiree Derek McLennan. I was made on Church of Scotland land, but the exact location hasn't been revealed. A gold ring found in the hoard is pictured . An early medieval cross was also found among the hoard of Viking treasure. The cross is engraved with decorations that experts claim are highly unusual, and which finder Mr McLennan believes may represent the four Gospels . A computerised tomography (CT) scan uses X-rays and a computer to create images of objects inside a body -  or in this case, a pot. During a CT scan, the person or object is placed on its back on a flat bed. The CT scanner consists of an X-ray tube that rotates around the object. These rays are received by a detector on the opposite side, and an image  is created. Images produced by a CT scan are called tomograms and are more detailed than standard X-rays. A CT scan, for example, can produce images of complex internal structures and shapes. The technology has previously been used to scan the insides of Egyptian mummies. ‘It was a heart-stopping moment when the local archaeologist turned it over to reveal rich decoration on the other side.’ The hoard falls under the Scots law of treasure trove, and is currently in the care of the Treasure Trove Unit. The law states that a reward must be made to the finder, and the reward is judged equivalent to the market value of the items. The Church of Scotland General Trustees, as the landowners, have reached agreement with Mr McLennan about an equitable sharing of any proceeds, which will eventually be awarded. The location of the find is not being revealed. The Scottish Government, Treasure Trove Unit and Historic Scotland are all involved in ensuring the area is properly protected while the full historical significance of the site is established.","Derek McLennan found more than 100 objects in Dumfries in September .

"Amish mafia revealed by Discovery Channel reality show of the same name . Focuses on Lebanon Levi and his three ‘foot soldiers’ who carry out his dirty work . 'Mafia' deals with adultery, extortion, accidents, and financial issues within close-knit religious community . Within the rolling hills of rural Pennsylvania, sects of Amish live out a seemingly modest existence, caring for their families and living lives of deep religious significance. But beneath the veil of their seemingly idyllic lifestyle lies something much more sinister – an Amish mafia, which serves as vigilante justice for the community and exposes infidelity, blackmail, and extortion plots. The provocative information has been revealed by Discovery Channel's upcoming reality show, 'Amish Mafia,' which focuses around the organization's leader and his three henchmen. A secretive group of Amish mafia have been unveiled by Discoveryfor a new reality show . Lebanon Levi, left, is the Amish insider who holds the power and serves as protector of the community - for a price. They are seen busting an Amish bishop out for motel sex and have no tolerance for infidelity either . In one scene from the pilot episode, two 'mafia' members stake out a prominent Amish bishop who was asking a taxi driver to take him to see a prostitute. The two men barge in on the bishop, camera in hand, to get photographic evidence of the bishop's sin. They then kindly let the woman cover up before letting her go on her way. While an Amish woman explains the conservative traditions of the lifestyle – long dresses, muted colors, no being photographed, no complicated machinery – a man loads a machine gun. This is the world of Lebanon Levi, a Mennonite who was never baptized, and therefore never a member of the church. Because of this, Levi is able to live in both communities, living amongst his people but also seeing that his idea of justice is served. Levi, a Mennonite was never baptized and therefore never a member of the church. He is able to live in both communities, living amongst his people but also seeing that his eye for an eye concept of justice is served . 'Levi is a man who straddles both worlds,' the show's executive producer, Dolores Gavin, explained to the New York Post earlier this month. 'He genuinely feels as though he is a help to the community, and yet he has a propensity for violence and intimidation.' She said that it took she and others two years to gain the trust of the elusive vigilantes. Gavin is most noted for her production work on reality shows like 'Ice Road Truckers,' 'Ax Men,' and 'Sons of Guns.' She was not immediately available to speak with MailOnline, a Discovery Channel representative said. The show opens with an ominous disclaimer, which reads: 'The Amish Church denies the existence of the Amish Mafia. To ensure the safety of innocent Amish, select re-enactments of events must be used.' The show depicts the gang as a violent crew, although they are still religious in their peace-loving church. The Amish church denies the mafia exists at all . Because the Amish Mafia doesn't have direct dealing with the church, they do not have to operate within its jurisdiction. They use cell phones, drive Cadillac SUVs, and tote guns to carry out what they believe is the law. Jolin, a Mennonite, is described as 'military foot soldier' in the pilot episode, set to air December 12. Many Amish sects are wary of 'English' laws, and will not report crimes to recognized authority figures. That leaves it to Levi and his cronies to seek justice for the meek and the mild. The Mennonite division is slightly less strict than many Amish sects, which the show says allows him to do Levi's 'dirty work.' In addition, Levi and his three mafia members – John, Jolin, and Alvin – cannot be punished by church elders. Their philosophy is an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. In the case of a woman whose buggy was destroyed by a reckless driver, Jolin took the matter into his own hands. He tracked the man who hit the Amish woman's buggy and fired a single shot through the empty car's window. Some scenes- and body art - is more reminiscent of Fight Club than depictions of the Amish previously shown in popular culture . The owner was unharmed, but the message was clear. Another time, Levi sent John and Jolin to stake out the house of a married Amish woman who was believed to have had an affair. The man was trying to extort the married woman to have sex with him, because her own husband had left her, causing financial struggle. Divorce is forbidden within the community, and a spouse must wait until their partner dies before re-marrying. John and Jolin stopped the man, who was driving his buggy down the road, and confronted him on the street. 'You will not go back there,' Jolin said. 'Lebanon Levi will kick your a**.' The two saw to it that the woman would be supported from funds from Levi. The pilot does not explain why the gang are comfortable using modern conveniences like automobiles, cell phones, and cameras, which are typically shunned . But these men still have to answer to the local jurisdictions. The Lancaster County Police did not offer any comment regarding Levi's criminal record. Levi is pictured in a 2009 mug shot. Though his charge and other vital information has been blackened out, Levi entered a guilty plea for his crime. Another case from 2007 shows he negotiated another guilty plea for five separate charges. Levi oversees the community's insurance, known as 'Amish Aid,' but is also in charge of the community's finances and keeping the general peace. His three 'soldiers' also have lengthy criminal records. MailOnline's request for comment to the Lancaster Police Bureau to confirm their records was not immediately returned. There is no explanation in the pilot as to why Levi and his gang are comfortable using modern conveniences like automobiles, cell phones, and cameras, which are typically shunned by conservative practicing Mennonites. In fact, a disclaimer at the beginning admits that some of the show is actually reenactments - done to protect the identities of innocent Amish . It is also unclear why various members of the Amish and Mennonite communities agreed to be on camera, as it goes against their beliefs of appearing vain. Some local Pennsylvania residents with deep interest in the Mennonite and Amish communities said that they had never heard of such a thing as the Amish mafia. 'My own view is this is trash TV,' Elizabethtown College professor Donald Kraybill told Lancaster Online. 'To call these shows documentaries is a fraudulent lie.' Kraybill has been a top researcher on the Amish's way of life. 'There is big money to be had,' he continued, 'and they pay these people big money to be on the show.' He told Lancaster Online that some members of the community have indeed been charged with crimes, but that going so far as to say there is a vigilante mafia is overboard. 'I'm not saying Amish are perfect saints and walk on water,' he continued. 'But this [show] is a twisted portrayal of the Amish community.' Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman added that to his knowledge, there has not been a spike of crime in the Anabaptist community in reason years. The show comes on the heels of TLC's 'Breaking Amish,' which has come under fire for deceiving viewers about the five Amish and Mennonite men and women it featured as they moved to New York. In the finale, cast members were given the opportunity to come clean over their questionably Amish lifestyles – which, before the show, included modeling careers, skimpy clothes, divorce, and arrests. However, many of them touted the fact that they were anything else but normal. Amish Mafia premieres on Discovery Channel on December 12 at 9pm EST.

"Airlines around the world have been warned by the British government not to allow CIA whistle-blower Edward Snowden to board any flights to the UK. The global alert has been issued to carriers warning the former US intelligence worker, who leaked details of the controversial Prism web spy programme, ‘is highly likely to be refused entry to the UK’. It marks a major escalation in Britain’s involvement in the snooping scandal, after Foreign Secretary William Hague repeatedly refused to comment on the leaks. Whistleblower: Edward Snowden, a 29-year-old former CIA technical assistant, claims Britain's GCHQ compiled 197 dossiers on UK citizens based on information from the US spying project Prism . Alert: The UK Home Office issued this warning to airlines that Mr Snowden would be refused entry to Britain . The warning to airlines was made on a Home Office letterhead dated on Monday, the Associated Press reported. The document is thought to be genuine but the Home Office refused to comment. Mr Snowden triggered shockwaves across the globe by handing over top-secret files from the US National Security Agency (NSA). The FBI vowed to hunt down Snowden as U.S. intelligence officials warned he . may be attempting to defect to China with a trove of America's most . sensitive secrets. The 29-year-old whistleblower, who . earned £130,000 a year ($200,000), exposed chilling details of how the . covert agency, based in Maryland, gathers private information from . people around the world – including in Britain – using a programme . called Prism.

He . is now holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, after seeking . asylum to avoid extradition to Sweden on allegations of sex offences. Mr Snowden fled the US for Hong Kong after smuggling highly . classified files out from the National Security Agency with a humble computer thumb drive, according to the Los Angeles Times. The Snowden alert to airlines not to let him fly to Britain emerged after a letter was photographed at a Thai airport. It was was issued by the Risk and Liaison Overseas Network which is part of the UK Border Agency monitoring people who try to enter Britain illegally. It imposes fines on carriers who bring any passenger to the UK without the proper documents or against instructions from the British government. The letter was titled 'RALON Carrier Alert 15/13 and referred to: Individual who is highly likely to be refused entry if arriving in the United Kingdom.' It features a photograph of Mr Snowden, his date of birth, passport number and status as a US citizen. It added: 'If . this individual attempts to travel the UK: Carriers should deny . boarding. 'This individual is highly likely to be refused entry to the UK and the carrier may be liable to costs relating to . the individual's detention and removal.' 'Carrier alerts' are issued when the U.K. government wants to deny entry . to people who don't normally need visas to enter the country, or . already have visas but something has happened since they were issued, . said the diplomat. Sometimes convicted sex offenders are denied entry . into the UK in this way. Vanished: A real estate sign stands in front of a home where Edward Snowden apparently lived with his girlfriend in  Hawaii.

"Young people who grow up in an unstable household are twice as likely to leave school with no good GCSEs, according to the Prince’s Trust. Those without a good education are also more likely to have been read fewer bedtime stories and to have had less support at home than their more successful peers, its research shows. It also suggests the parents of those aged 16-25 with no A* to C grade GCSEs are less likely to help with their child’s homework. The survey found stability at  home was linked to success in  later life, according to the  charity’s fourth annual Youth  Happiness Index. GCSE students are more likely to achieve better grades if they receive additional supported at home . Nearly half (45 per cent) of all high-achieving 16- to 25-year-olds said someone at home always helped them with their schoolwork, as opposed to 38 per cent of those with no qualifications. Those with no good GCSEs were less than half as likely to have someone read to them as the  average young person, according to the YouGov survey. Milburn is encouraging parents to be more involved in their children's education . he lack of routine also impacted upon their mental health, with the number of those with no qualifications three times more likely to be depressed than their well-educated peers. One in three of those with lower qualifications ‘always’ or ‘often’  felt rejected, compared with one in five overall. Those with no good GCSEs were also more likely to have irregular mealtimes than those with more than five GCSEs at grades A* to C. Martina Milburn, chief executive of the Prince’s Trust, said: ‘Without the right support, directionless teenagers can become lost young adults – unconfident, under-qualified and unemployed.’ Taking exercise may help to boost pupils’ performance in the classroom. Scientists at the Vrije University Medical Centre in Amsterdam found a ‘significant positive relationship’ between physical activity and academic success in children and teenagers. Exercise may help by increasing blood and oxygen flow to the brain, their analysis suggests.",Prince's Trust report suggests parents of 16-25-year-olds with no A* to C grade GCSEs less likely to help with their child’s homework .
"Gangs of highway robbers are targeting British tourists on holiday in Spain. Hundreds of visitors in British-registered vehicles or hire cars have had their possessions, passports and money taken in ‘quick and slick’ distraction muggings. The thieves typically trick their victims with loud noises, apparent accidents, supposed vehicle problems or pleas for help – before stealing bags and belongings from their vehicles. Thieves: Hundreds of visitors in British-registered vehicles or hire cars have had their possessions, passports and money taken in 'quick and slick' distraction muggings . As millions of families begin their summer breaks, the Foreign Office has warned British-registered cars are ‘an easy target’ for motorway thieves. The number of British tourists ambushed on Spanish roads has soared as the euro crisis has deepened, with the British Embassy in Madrid reporting a 10 per cent rise in the first quarter of this year. This is likely to increase further as the peak holiday season begins. A spokesman for the embassy said:  ‘Motorists may be driving along the motorway and not notice there’s a car close up behind. ‘Someone in the other car throws a stone at their vehicle which creates a loud bang. The British drivers pull over to see what has happened and the gang is behind them. ‘They cause a distraction to steal from them or simply mug them. It’s a growing problem.’ Warning: As millions of families begin their summer breaks, the Foreign Office has warned British-registered cars are ¿an easy target¿ for motorway thieves . A hotspot for the gangs is the AP7 motorway between the French border and the Alicante region in southern Spain. More than 140 cases of theft on this route were reported to British Consulates last year. However, a spokesman said there were likely to be ‘hundreds more’ attacks going unreported across Spain because victims usually contact a British consulate only if they have lost their passport. Dave Thomas, consular regional director for Spain, said: ‘Be on your guard against anyone who attempts to stop you or ask you for help. ‘They may well be part of a  gang operating a scam in which an unseen accomplice will rob you of your things.’ Stephen and Helen Robinson, from Desford, Leicestershire, had their bags stolen from their Audi Q5 as they stopped to walk their labrador retriever Polly at a service station between Barcelona and Valencia. The couple, who are in their 50s, were standing at the boot of their car when a man on a mobile phone asked them how to say something in English. While he distracted them, their belongings were taken from the front of the car, despite Polly being inside. Mrs Robinson said: ‘It was quick and slick. You may be more tired and therefore more vulnerable when you’ve been travelling, so separate your valuables into different places in the car, and when you stop be aware you may be being watched. You won’t see the accomplice of the person who is distracting you.’ In a separate incident, Joy and Alan Horton, from Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, were driving a Ford Focus hatchback through Spain when they heard a loud bang and pulled over. A car that had been travelling close behind them also stopped, and while the driver talked to them, his accomplice stole their possessions without them noticing. Mr Horton said: ‘If you think your car may have been in a collision and you pull over, lock the car as soon as you get out and mount a guard on both sides of the vehicle. Keep all bags and valuables in a locked boot.’ Professor Stephen Glaister, of the RAC Foundation, said: ‘Drivers need to remember to stay alert and be ready for unwelcome surprises just as they would be at home.’","Thieves typically trick their victims with loud noises, apparent accidents, or supposed vehicle problems .

"Two U.S. Embassy military attaches wounded at a strip joint in Venezuela may have shot each other, a club employee has said. Officers heard shots around 4.25am on Tuesday at the Antonella 2012 club in Caracas, better known as 'Angelus' in the upscale Chacao district, local police said. Today, it was revealed the pair may have been fighting each other before at least one of them drew a gun. Scroll down for video . Violence: Three Americans were reportedly involved in a brawl outside the Antonella 2012 strip club in an upscale neighborhood of Caracas early Tuesday . Older crowd: The club, which is popular with foreigners, reportedly only admits men over age 30 . Suggestive: The Twitter account for the Antonella 2012 suggests the strip club could offer more than just stripping . Deisy Ron, who oversees performers at . the club, said staff working on the night of the shooting told her the . men had begun arguing inside the club. 'They were fighting with each other,' she said. 'One of them pulled out a gun and shot the other in the stomach and the leg.' She said she did not know how the second American was wounded. An employee had told Agence . France-Presse that the the bar is a strip club that only admits men over . age 30. Pictures of female strippers line the entrance to the club. One . of the embassy employees, military attaché Roberto Ezequiel Rosas, was . shot in the leg, according to a police report seen by Reuters and the . source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The second embassy official, Paul Marwin, was shot in the stomach but did not notice the injury until arriving home, the source said. The wounds are not believed to be life-threatening. Party time: The nightclub's social media sites feature pictures of strippers dancing on poles, in cages and laying on beds . It's unclear what services the strip club offers patrons on these beds in private rooms next to the club . A police source told AFP that a third American was involved, as well, but he was not wounded. The . shooting happened just outside the strip club after the Americans got . into an argument with other patrons of the nightclub, police say. 'Apparently . it was a fight originating in a nightspot where these people were . attacked and shots were fired at them and they suffered gunshot wounds,' police spokesman Douglas Rico told Venezuelan TV channel Globovision. In a terse statement, the embassy confirmed an 'incident,' but gave few details. 'We can confirm that two members of the U.S. Embassy in Caracas were injured during an incident early this morning. Medical staff informs us that their injuries do not appear to be life-threatening,' the statement said. On Tuesday afternoon, Reuters reporters saw police detective vehicles parked near the club, which is popular among foreigners. Officials walked in and out of the club without answering questions. Venezuela has one of the world's highest homicide rates. Violent crime occurs primarily in the country's poor slums, but in recent years, assaults and shootings have become more common in well-to-do areas of the city. Last week, President Nicolas Maduro launched a security drive that puts soldiers on the streets of the capital. About 20 security initiatives have been implemented since 1999. The Venezuela shooting may revive memories of an incident that embarrassed U.S. officials in Colombia last year. In that case, Secret Service agents helping to protect President Barack Obama were sent home for involvement with prostitutes.

"A principal and his wife have been sacked from a college whose stated aim is to promote multiculturalism because they are white Christians, they claim. Professor Malory Nye, 47, says he was dismissed from the Al-Maktoum College of Higher Education in Dundee, Scotland, because his race and religion were seen by his superiors as a threat to its core Muslim values. He says the college’s claims to pursuing multicultural values were a charade and that he was dismissed so he could be replaced by a Muslim. His wife Isabel Campbell-Nye, 42, alleges she was forced from her position as head of the English language centre because she attracted too many students who were not Muslims or Arabs. Dismissed: Malory Nye and his wife Isabel say Al-Maktoum College's claim to promote multiculturalism was a charade . The independent college, whose patron is Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, the Deputy Ruler of Dubai, advertises itself as a research-led institution 'that promotes a greater understanding of different religions and cultures in a multicultural context, for the benefit of the wider community'. The couple are taking the college to an employment tribunal claiming racial and religious discrimination, and unfair dismissal. Mrs Campbell-Nye is also claiming sex discrimination after she was suspended and later dismissed apparently because she is married to Prof Nye. The couple, from Perth, were marched off the college grounds in June and have not been allowed to return since. They claim they were given no reason for their suspensions and were dismissed in November despite no evidence of any wrongdoing. The couple have also lodged grievances . against the chancellor of the College Lord Elder – a Labour peer and . close friend of former Prime Minister Gordon Brown - for his handling of . what they describe as a ‘sham’ disciplinary process. Agenda? The couple say the college, which is sponsored by the Dubai royal family, wanted more Muslim students . Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the deputy ruler of Dubai, is patron of the college . Prof Nye and his wife began working at the college eight and four years ago respectively, choosing to marry on the campus last year. However, they believe their attempts at pushing it in a more cosmopolitan direction angered their superiors. Prof Nye said his suspension came just days after he changed the college’s name from the ‘Al-Maktoum Institute for Arabic and Islamic studies’. The couple allege that Abubaker Abubaker, the director of operations, and Mirza al-Sayegh, chairman of its board of directors and private secretary to the Sheikh, decided to force them out because they were British, white and Christian. Prof Nye told the Telegraph: 'It is clear to me that there is collusion between these two individuals that I should be removed from my position on the basis that I am not an Arab and not a Muslim and that the person who has the role of principal should be Arab and/or Muslim. 'Multiculturalism and respect for cultural and religious differences are, I had thought, core values of the college. 'However, I believe that such inclusive multiculturalism no longer fits the particular type of multicultural vision of certain managers and the chairman, that is accepting of different cultures, so long as the majority of students are Muslims and/or Arabs and the ethos is distinctly Islamic. 'My face and lack of Muslim faith no longer fit.' Mrs Campbell-Nye says Mr Abubaker also wanted her removed from her position because she had attracted too many European and Asian students, who weren't Muslim, to her English course at the college, which receives no public funding. She said: 'Some are from Arab and other Muslim backgrounds. However, a substantial number are from other parts of the world and other cultures. 'I believe Mr Abubaker does not feel . happy with us recruiting students from these backgrounds as it does not . fit the particular multicultural vision he has for English language. 'The only times Mr Abubaker has encouraged me to bring in students to English language are when they are Arabs or Muslims. The two teachers were even married on the college's campus before they were sacked . The college was until recently known as the Al-Maktoum Institute for Arabic and Islamic Studies . 'I . believe that Mr Abubaker’s discrimination against me, because I am not . Muslim, I am not Arab, and I am also a woman – and because I have . brought a number of non Muslim/non-Arab students to the college – is a . significant reason for my suspension.' Despite . a waiting list for places on its English language courses, the college . closed the department last month, leaving its two remaining tutors . redundant at Christmas. The . college, which operates as a charity in partnership with the University . of Aberdeen, advertises in its prospectus that 'multiculturalism is at . the centre of our vision and structure'. 'Our . multicultural ethos is visibly translated and implemented in our . day-to-day operation. Our staff and students come from diverse national, . cultural and religious backgrounds including Muslims and non-Muslims,' it says. A spokesman for the college said: 'We can confirm that we have been notified that Employment Tribunal proceedings have been raised in the name of Professor Malory Nye and his wife, Isabel Campbell-Nye. 'The College, an independent, not-for-profit charity, places diversity, religious pluralism and multiculturalism firmly at the core of its Higher Education programmes – and its day-to-day activities,' the spokesman said.

It shows that Verizon Communications is the biggest company in New York, while the retailer Costco has trumped Microsoft Corporation in Washington. Although it was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1975, Microsoft moved to Bellevue, Washington, just four years later in a bid to recruit more top programmers. According to the map, the retailer Wal-Mart is the leading firm in Arkansas, General Motors in Michigan and the Bank of America in North Carolina. Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson is the largest company in New Jersey, health care firm CVS Caremark in Rhode Island and chemical company DuPont in Delaware.

In a touching show of support after Ohio beat Wisconsin this weekend, every single member of the Ohio team stopped to embrace Tiberi and welcome him back, the video shows. Tiberi seemed completely overwhelmed by their kindness and took a moment to regain control of his emotions after the final player left. Scroll down for video . Support: Broadcaster Dom Tiberi is hugged by every member of the Ohio State University football team after he returns to work following the death of his daughter, Maria, who was killed in a car crash . It came after his emotional return to the anchor desk on Thursday. He thanked viewers for their support and spoke of his love for his wife and his family. 'It's never going to be the same. A . little piece of me died,' he said as he welled up with emotion. 'We're going to . try to make a positive out of this and thanks for sticking with me.' His daughter Maria, herself an Ohio State student, died after her Toyota Corolla struck a tractor-trailer on I-210 in Hilliard around 10.45pm on September 17. She was rushed to Ohio Health Grant Medical Center but later died. Police said the truck had apparently stopped in heavy traffic and the 30-year-old female driver was not injured in the crash.

"Twelve secondary school heads voiced their ‘disgust’ yesterday at strikes in support of a militant teacher battling to keep her job as a full-time union official. As teachers walked out in defence of Julie Davies, the heads accused the National Union of Teachers of ‘making children pay’ for a personal dispute. Mrs Davies, who is paid £45,900 a year, has not taught since 2000 when she became a full-time NUT rep. She has been suspended after heads accused her of ‘confrontation’ and encouraging ‘a climate of mistrust’. Julie Davies, who is paid £49,500 a year but has not taught since 2000 when she became a full-time National Union of Teachers rep . They refused to continue to fund her union work but Mrs Davies is leading two-day strikes in protest, initially targeting Fortismere and Highgate Wood schools in north London. In letter to the council leader signed by 11 colleagues, Dame Joan McVittie, head of Woodside High, accused the NUT of ‘retaliation against the children’. She said: ‘The current strikes, and further proposed strikes, will cause great damage to the education of young people in both of these schools and I have no doubt that other schools will be affected.’ The letter added: ‘I am disgusted by the response of the NUT: instead of negotiating with the employer, it has chosen to strike in selected schools, thereby damaging the life chances of vulnerable young people in this authority. ‘It cannot be right that children should be made to pay for a dispute that is essentially between a union official and her employer, the local authority.’ Teachers at the two schools will walk out again with ballots planned at two more schools – Hornsey School for Girls and Parkview. A petition calling on NUT general secretary Christine Blower to step in and end the strike had attracted nearly 200 signatures last night. One mother-of-two in her 40s whose children are at Fortismere, said the strike had been ‘disruptive’. Twelve secondary school heads voiced their ‘disgust’ yesterday at strikes in support of Mrs Davies, pictured, who is battling to keep her job as a full-time union official . ‘I'm self-employed so it's been difficult to get on with my work with the children at home,’ she said. 'I worry that this may set a precedent for the future. 'Why does she think she can disrupt all the kids in their schooling just because she feels the rules don't apply to her? 'I don't see why the kids have to be dragged into this. 'It beggars belief and it's tantamount to blackmail. She's blackmailing the council. 'It's wrong and she's showing no sign of backing down. She seems determined she's going to win this no matter what - and at the expense of the children. 'I'm so frustrated about this, it really annoys me.’ Meanwhile a father in his 40s whose children attend Highgate Wood school said: 'We are just concerned about our children's education. They're being used for a political issue which is nothing to do with them. 'A single Union rep should not have the power to call strikes relating to their own personal issues. 'For the sake of our kids and our sanity please get on and resolve this now.' Schools in Haringey currently pool their funds to pay Mrs Davies’ wages but many heads are unwilling to continue the arrangement. A petition calling on NUT general secretary Christine Blower, pictured, to step in and end the strike had attracted nearly 200 signatures . Groups representing both primary and secondary heads have written to Haringey Council warning that they will refuse to continue contributing to the fund amid concerns over the conduct of the local NUT branch. The letter from local secondary heads said: ‘Secondary school head teachers have found, and continue to find, that Ms Davies' preferred approach and working style is one of confrontation and obfuscation. ‘Our combined experience is that she seeks to encourage a climate of mistrust, often involving the airing of her personal critiques of individual head teachers, rather than seeking to develop effective communication channels or relationships based on trust and openness.’ Another letter, from a ‘significant number of primary head teachers’, stated: ‘It is our view that it is simply not feasible to do so whilst current union working practices exist.’ Mrs Davies was suspended in July over the concerns expressed by heads as well as other allegations, including that she sent a tweet spreading news about a Haringey mayor ‘abusing’ her position and also that she fired off a rude email to a councillor after food waste was not collected in her street. The council’s investigation into the claims is ongoing.","Heads have voiced their 'disgust' at strikes in support of Julie Davies .

"Hundreds of infants and toddlers have reportedly been captured by border officers after crossing into the U.S. illegally from Mexico unaccompanied by an adult as a growing number of migrants from Central America overwhelm detention centers in Texas. The U.S. Border Patrol detained 378 children aged two or less who were traveling without a parent or guardian from Oct 1 through June 11, according to data obtained by Fusion from the office of a high-ranking Democratic senator who wasn't identified. Of those, 95 were under a year old. Parents may be sending their wee ones across the border in hopes they will be allowed to stay, fueled in part by misconceptions among migrants that people with children can enter the U.S. legally. Children detainees sleep in a holding cell at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection processing facility in Brownsville, Texas, earlier this month . The federal government will spend more than $1 billion this year feeding, clothing and otherwise babysitting the children until suitable adult guardians can be found. HHS claims 85 per cent of them are reunited with family members, but those are guardians in the United States, not in their home countries. The agency has not responded to requests for information about how many of them are themselves illegal aliens. The growing number of immigrants trying to make it into the U.S. is being driven in part by a misconception that children won't be deported. That's a misinterpretation of a 2012 policy that delays the deportation of illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children prior to 2007. Still, unaccompanied children are more likely than adults to slip through the cracks and ultimately remain in the U.S. for months or even years. Once captured, most minors are processed and reunited with family members or a guardian in the U.S. while they await deportation proceedings. Detention facilities are generally not equipped to handle young people, especially infants and toddlers. But because of the significant backlog and lack of resources put into tracking them, few are expected to ever return and face immigration judges. Few of the children are expected to return to face immigration judges, according to the nation's largest border patrolman's union. In 2012 President Obama announced a policy intended to delay the deportation of illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children before 2007. But in a transnational game of 'telephone', that policy has been misinterpreted – in some cases willfully so, by 'coyotes' who make a living transporting immigrants into the U.S. – to suggest that it would apply equally to newly arriving minors. Rumors also persist that the U.S. will pass immigration reform that will grant migrants already within its borders amnesty and a right to remain. The steady stream of tens of thousands of . unaccompanied children is part of a recent surge in Central Americans . crossing into the U.S. via the . Rio Grande Valley in Texas. About 174,000 people have been arrested by . the Border Patrol there since Oct 1, including 52,000 children - a 99 per cent . increase from last year. Most of the migrants hail from Honduras, El . Salvador and Guatemala. The average age of an unaccompanied child is 14, according to Emily Butera, a senior program officer at the Women's Refugee Commission. The Obama Administration is trying to address the problem by combating the misinformation and opening new detention facilities designed for families in an effort to . process and deport them more quickly. The first one will be located on . the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center's Artesia, New Mexico, . campus, according to The Wall Street Journal. At the moment, the Border Patrol is releasing many of them while they . await their deportation proceedings because there is no place to hold . them, making it easier for them to blend into the population and remain for years. Customs and Border Protection agents escort young detainees primarily from Central  America to an area to make phone calls . The . immigration agency currently has only one detention center designed for families, . an 85-bed facility in Pennsylvania. The rising number of migrants have overwhelmed U.S. authorities at the U.S.'s busiest corridor for crossings in South Texas, forcing them to seek out additional detention space. A plan to bus hundreds to an empty college campus in Lawrenceville, Virginia, was scrapped after a community backlash, according to CBS News. The government is also trying to ease agents' workload by flying hundreds of migrants to California for processing, the AP reported. Two flights on Monday will ferry about 140 Central American migrants to San Diego and a nearby town, according to Paul Beeson, chief of the Border Patrol for the California city. A toddler sits on the floor with other detainees at the Customs and Border Protection processing facility in Brownsville, Texas, on Wednesday . The flights are expected to continue every three days, primarily filled with families with young children, but no unaccompanied minors. Neither plan, however, will help address the growing number of children making the perilous journy across the border alone. Vice President Joe Biden met with Central American leaders in Guatemala on Friday in hopes of discouraging minors from making the voyage and emphasizing that traveling with children does not give migrants a free pass. Vice President Joe Biden visited Guatemala on Friday in an effort to stem the tide of Central American children and families crossing into the U.S. illegally . 'We . are prioritizing the need to resolve these cases…in light of the . humanitarian crisis caused by the number of crossings,' Mr Biden said. 'Make no mistake, once an individual's case is fully heard, and . if he or she does not qualify for asylum, he or she will be removed from . the United States and returned home. Everyone should know that.' Detainees wait in a holding cell at the Brownsville detention center that was part of a media tour the Customs and Border Protection agency hosted .","The Border Patrol has detained 378 unaccompanied children aged two or less since Oct 1, more than a quarter of whom were under a year old .

"Men and women are being segregated at universities as academics bow to the beliefs of extremist Islamic speakers.University authorities are allowing the separation of sexes in fear of infringing the rights of the firebrands.In most cases, women are made to sit at the back of rooms but in some instances they have been made to sit in a separate room and watch proceedings on screens via a live feed. Anger: Protesters hold up placards rejecting 'gender apartheid' outside the headquarters of Universities Uk in London last night after their guidelines agreed that women and men can be segregated . Anger: The segregation by sex at university talks by visiting speakers has been called discrimination and those concerned say decision will take Britain backwards . Out of 180 visits by extremists . monitored over a 12-month period, a quarter – or 46 – at 21 institutions . were found to have promoted segregation by gender. Six of these events . were cancelled, usually after complaints from students. The astonishing practice was unearthed by Student Rights, a group set up to monitor extremism on university campuses. It . said security staff at one debate organised by the Islamic Education . and Research Academy at University College London ‘tried to physically . remove members of the audience who would not comply’ with a sexual . segregation policy. The practice is effectively supported by . Universities UK, an umbrella organisation that speaks on behalf of 132 . British universities. Its guidance says that failing to segregate men . and women might breach ‘the freedom of speech of the religious group or . speaker’. Action: University College London has banned one Muslim group after it found one group had demanded gender segregation . Greek Islamic convert Hamza Andreas Tzortzis was a speaker at the debate at UCL, his spokesman said earlier this year that segregation was informal . Graham Stuart, chairman of the Commons education select . committee, branded the guidance ‘nonsense’ yesterday and demanded that . it be reviewed. ‘Segregation by sex is completely unacceptable in a . publicly-funded institution,’ he said. Keith Porteous Wood, of the . National Secular Society, accused universities of betraying the . ‘hallowed principles of freedom of expression’ by ‘succumbing to demands . from speakers, generally those trying to undermine universal human . rights’. Student Rights, which describes extremism on campuses as ‘an . increasingly worrying trend’, looked at all visits by extremist . speakers in the 12 months to March. Director Raheem Kassam said . segregation forced ‘cultural practices’ on to people on a public campus. ‘It . is disgraceful that this can happen in a modern and equal society,’ he . said. ‘If we’re going to make concessions like this then where does it . stop? Should we segregate people by race?’ Students have been protesting outside the London headquarters of Universities UK this week over its stance. The . issue provoked a furious exchange between Muslim newspaper columnist . Yasmin Alibhai-Brown and Omar Ali, of the Federation of Student Islamic . Societies, on Channel 4 News. Worries: . Leicester University spoke of its concerns over photos showing . hand-written signs requesting that male and female students sat in . separate areas at a public talk by the university’s Islamic Society . Mrs Alibhai-Brown described it as a . ‘disaster for feminism, university life and progressive ideals’. ‘You . can do what you like in mosques and temples,’ she said. ‘These are . meetings by fundamentalists telling women to get out of the public . space. ‘You are using democracy,  freedom, the great rights, to . fundamentally destroy these very rights. Don’t use our universities to . impose these Saudi Arabian practices.’ Mr Ali dismissed ‘segregation’ as ‘an emotive use of language’. ‘If a society is set up to cater for . religious needs on campus, why shouldn’t they?’ he said. ‘A lot of . people would find it insulting to say this is something discriminatory . against women.’ A Universities UK spokesman said its guidance ‘does . not promote gender segregation’ and allows universities to make . decisions ‘on a case by case basis’. ‘It includes a hypothetical case . study involving an external speaker talking about his orthodox . religious faith who had requested segregated seating areas,’ said the . spokesman. ‘It concluded that if neither women nor men were . disadvantaged and a non-segregated seating area also provided, a . university could decide it is appropriate to agree to the request.’","Universities UK says 132 members can allow men and women to sit apart .

"Australia was on the verge of announcing it had its own Loch Ness monster after strange S-shape and loop shape formations were spotted by a weather bureau radar off the west Australian coast. The unusual images sparked a frenzy of rumour online with some weather groups dubbing the initial 80km-wide formation the Rottnest monster, as it appeared off Rottnest Island. Speculation mounted after a second shape was spotted today, adding to the intrigue. Giant squiggle: This first weather radar image sparked huge speculation that a mystery creature could be off the coast of Rottnest Island in western Australia . The loop-shaped formation added to speculation there was a Loch Ness-type creature living off the West Australian coast . However, the mystery was finally resolved this afternoon after the Department of Defence revealed that the formation was actually related to the navy testing a ship system in the area. 'The unusual pattern that appeared on the Bureau of Meteorology's Perth weather radar on Wednesday 12, was the result of a Defence exercise off the west Australian Coast,' a Defence spokesman said . 'The exercise is a regular training activity involving ships and aircraft, that is designed to prepare a Navy warship for an operational deployment. This exercise is ongoing. 'The environmental conditions over the west Australian coast at the time of the activity provided a unique opportunity for this routine activity to be visible on the weather radar display.' WA Weather Group administrator Sean Gray, 39, said he had hoped the formations were a sign of another life form such as a Loch Ness monster-type creature. 'The explanation totally ruined it - the mystery is over,' he said. 'I think if there's going to be a rumour, let's give it a name and make it a Rott Nest monster. It would be great for tourism and could get tours going.' Mystery creature: Online groups had speculated that the squiggles could give Rottnest island its own Loch Ness monster . Mr Gray said people had seen navy activity in the area, but he did not believe this caused the formation. 'The thing that got everybody was how long it lingered on the radar and moved in the wind,' he said. 'It was slow moving, it was slower moving than an aircraft dumping fuel but too fast for a helicopter. The innuendo going around is not based on science.' Bureau of Meteorology meteorologist Rabi Rivett had said there was no explanation for the giant shape, but used a process of elimination to ruling out some causes. 'It's nothing meteorological. It's not a cloud, radars don't pick up clouds, that's not what they're for.' He said military chaff had also been ruled out. 'Sometimes military with the chaff can cause different formations, but the fact it maintained its shape as it moved north-west rules that out,' he said. 'If it was military-related they did a very good job of flying that signature in a very short period of time,' he said. 'It didn't change shape as it moved - caught in the wind it would have changed.' WA Weather Group spokesperson Peter Coe, 19, said the formation had caused confusion among weather enthusiasts. 'It could be something like a Loch Ness monster, but that wouldn't show up on a radar,' he said. Mr Coe has been part of the weather enthusiast group, based in Perth, since 2010 and said he had never seen anything like the formation before. 'That particular shape sparked a lot of interest - it's a bit unusual,' he said.","Loop-shaped formation picked up by weather bureau radar off west Australian coast near Mandurah .

"Suzanne Morgan said some pupils were 'a little more than obsessed' with computer games . A primary school headteacher - fed up with sleepy pupils - has written an open letter to parents warning of the dangers of online gaming and allowing late night television in bedrooms after children in her school were 'ready for bed' by midday. Suzanne Morgan, headteacher at Saltdean Primary School in Brighton, East Sussex, wrote a letter on the school website addressed to 'parents, carers and children'. In the letter she claims some pupils were 'a little more than obsessed' with computer games and admitted to playing them 'late into the night'. The letter goes on: 'This lack of sleep becomes cumulative and it is very difficult for staff to inspire learning from children who by 12 o'clock are ready to go to sleep.' She adds that the teachers are greeted with 'tired looks' in the morning. Mrs Morgan also highlights the problem with allowing children having televisions in their rooms: 'As more children have televisions in their rooms, we are finding that some are also watching TV until late.' She also writes to parents directly: 'Obviously, we can only talk to children about good habits and about the need for a definitive amount of sleep at their age. 'We need cooperation of parents and carers to ensure that all our children arrive at school in the best possible frame of mind for learning.' Georgie Kennedy from Brighton and Hove Parents' Forum said parents needed to take action. She said: 'There is a huge danger with online games. 'There are all sorts of things online especially if these children are accessing it in their bedrooms. 'And in the virtual reality world they lose out on interacting with others. If there is no discipline in the home how will they get on in later life? In her letter to parents she warned of the dangers of online gaming and allowing late night television in bedrooms after children at Saltdean Primary School, Essex, were 'ready to go to sleep' by midday . Mrs Morgan urged parents to 'shut down computers and television at a reasonable time' 'Everyone needs to hear 'no' at some point.' The news comes after another primary school in Sussex issues a warning to parents about children playing in violent video games. Meeching Valley Primary School in Newhaven said last month that children as young as seven or eight were acting out on-screen violence in the playground. Primary school children range from age 4 to 11. It has come to my attention that some of our older . pupils are a little more than obsessed with various computer games. Some . are admitting to playing these late into the night, especially the . 'live' versions on line, hence the extremely tired looks we are greeted . with in the mornings. This . lack of sleep becomes cumulative and it is very difficult for staff to . inspire learning from children who by 12 o'clock are ready to go to . sleep. As more . children have televisions in their rooms, we are finding that some are . also watching TV until late. It is also affecting punctuality for a few . pupils who are simply not waking up early enough to get here on time. They haven't realised the need for a time gap between playing a game or watching TV, and settling to sleep. Obviously, we can only talk to children about good habits and about the need for a definitive amount of sleep at their age. We . need cooperation of parents and carers to ensure that all our children . arrive at school in the best possible frame of mind for learning.

"Hounded out: Royden Cope has lost his job at St Bartholomew's in Lancashire despite an unblemished 40-year career . A deputy headmaster with an unblemished 41-year career has been forced to quit after an ‘uncontrollable’ seven-year-old boy accused him of assault. Royden Cope, who had an ‘impeccable’ record as deputy head for 34 years, was ‘marched out’ of a Church of England primary school after the pupil claimed he hit him. In March last year Mr Cope was alleged to have restrained the unruly pupil by his wrists before slapping him across the face. He was charged with assault in May. But at the end of a four-month nightmare he was cleared by magistrates after grave doubts were raised about the case. Despite fierce criticism of the prosecution and massive support for Mr Cope, he remained suspended from his job while education bosses carried out a disciplinary investigation. Now 63-year-old Mr Cope – who is thought to have suffered a minor heart attack since the court case – has decided not to return to his £44,000-a-year post. Yesterday Mr Cope from Accrington, Lancashire, would say only: ‘I am sad to leave the profession after 41 years.’ It is believed the youngster who levelled the accusations at Mr Cope is still being taught at the school, St Bartholomew’s in Great Harwood, Lancashire. Mr Cope’s daughter Joy Corrigan, 33, said that since the allegations she has had to remove her eight-year-old daughter from the school after the girl was ‘goaded’ by the young boy. Mrs Corrigan, who is also a teacher, added: ‘The saddest thing is that my dad was nearing retirement and after such a long career one of his resounding memories will be being marched off the premises. It should not have ended like this.’ Parents have been left shocked and angry that a highly regarded teacher has effectively been forced out of his job. Victoria Mather, 34, said: ‘I think it’s horrible what has happened to him in the past year and he went through a lot because of that court case. ‘It is no surprise that this has taken its toll. He’s been in the profession for such a long time – it’s not right that it has come to this but he has always had a lot of support from the parents who stood by him.’ Kerry Molyneux, 30, said: ‘I’m really disappointed that he has chosen to step down but I can understand why. I just don’t think he wanted to have all this added stress. We are sorry to see him go as he was a good long-standing teacher.’ Accusations: St Bartholomew's Parish C.E. Aided Primary School in Great Harwood, Lancashire where Deputy Head Roy Cope was accused of assaulting a pupil . Linda Holt, 63, whose grandchildren attend the school, said: ‘I feel sorry for him and it has probably had a lot of effect on him and his family to be accused of something like that.’ ‘Some of the kids today are out of control and they know exactly what their rights are, they say “you can’t touch me”. It was never like that in my day, there isn’t any respect any more.’ But the 38-year-old mother of the pupil – who cannot be named for legal reasons – defended her son and said she was ‘glad to see the back’ of Mr Cope . ‘We didn’t take it to court the police did,’ she said. The mother, a music teacher, said he had never misbehaved at home and criticised other parents and staff who said he was disruptive. ‘I’m not saying he’s perfect but... he isn’t a devil child how they’ve made out he was,’ she said. Mr Cope had faced up to six months in jail following the assault allegation. But in August he was cleared by Blackburn magistrates when the chairman of the bench, Graham Parr, said there were ‘real doubts’ about the case. The court heard that the boy had been disruptive since starting school and had been removed from classrooms regularly after he was violent towards other children. In his statement to police Mr Cope said the boy was the most ‘disruptive and aggressive’ he had encountered in his career. He said: ‘On some occasions he is uncontrollable. As he has got older, he has become more aware of his own physical prowess and he has become more aggressive.’ Unblemished career: Mr Cope is pictured arriving at court last year . On the day of the incident in March last year, the boy is said to have ran amok, hitting ten classmates with his bag, pinning one of them to the wall and yelling at teachers. Mr Cope was called to deal with him. Three days later, the boy told his mother that he had been hit by Mr Cope. She said he had described ‘a struggle’ and said Mr Cope had grabbed his wrists before he ‘slapped him’. Mr Cope told the court that the youngster had worked himself up into an ‘incandescent rage’. He said: ‘He was next to a cupboard and a desk leg, and I held him by the hands as I was concerned he would bang his head. ‘I was trying to stop his head from rolling around so I put my hand out to stop him. That’s when he slammed into my hand and there was contact. ‘This allegation has caused me and my family great distress.’ Another teacher, Thomas Lowe, claimed he did see Mr Cope strike the boy. His evidence was rejected by the magistrates. Mark Mackley, headteacher at St Bartholomew’s, confirmed yesterday that after ‘careful deliberation’ Mr Cope had decided to step down.","Royden Cope had an 'impeccable' 41-year career as a teacher .

"Sir Michael Wilshaw, Ofsted's chief inspector for schools, has warned rowdy behaviour in class is dragging schools down . Rowdy behaviour in class and a contempt for learning are dragging English pupils behind their peers in Asian countries, the chief inspector of schools will warn today. The education of 700,000 children – one in ten overall – is suffering because teachers are failing to crack down on ‘horseplay’, Sir Michael Wilshaw will say. In a speech to mark the launch of Ofsted’s annual report, he plans to describe how schools are plagued by a ‘casual acceptance of low-level disruption and poor attitudes to learning’ that is ‘a million miles away from the sort of cultures we see in some of the high-performing Asian countries’. The comments come a week after the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development revealed that 15-year-old Asian children are easily outperforming other students from around the world. British pupils came outside the top 20 in maths, science and reading for the first time – and are now lagging an average of around three years behind their counterparts in the Far East. The results painted a troubling picture of the UK’s ability to compete with countries where teachers are revered and iron-willed pupils study for 12 hours or more every day. Ofsted plans to focus on behaviour during the coming year, and headteachers will be expected to take back control of classrooms, Sir Michael will announce. Only by creating ‘the calm and respectful culture essential for learning’ can classes avoid being hijacked by ‘background chatter, inattention and horseplay’. He will go on to say: ‘Unless this changes, teachers will struggle to create an environment in which all children learn well.’ The former headteacher criticised teachers last month for failing to show pupils that adults are in charge. He said there was ‘nothing wrong’ with telling children: ‘Do as I ask because I am the adult.’ He also attacked a generation of headteachers who are too weak-willed to lead by example, explaining: ‘Children cannot thrive in a chaotic school where there is little authority.’ School staff were handed new powers in 2011 to tackle disruptive pupils. Teachers were given more leeway to use force, the right to search children for items such as mobile phones – and financial penalties were increased for parents who allow their children to truant. How Britain's schools are lagging behind some of the best performing Asian schools . Other powers teachers have been given include issuing no-notice detentions. And a school’s decision to exclude a pupil can no longer be reversed by an appeals panel. Education Secretary Michael Gove said the measures would give disruptive pupils an ‘unambiguous lesson in who’s boss’. A quarter of free schools have opened in areas where there is no demand for extra places, according to an official report. The National Audit Office said 42 of the 174 schools set up over the past three years are in districts with ‘no forecast need’. It . means £241million out of the £950million in set-up costs has so far . been spent in areas where there are already surplus places. But Sir Michael’s speech will suggest that he believes teachers still lack the confidence to exert their authority after years of seeing their powers eroded. He will also insist today that  poverty is no longer an excuse for academic failure, and will describe the nation’s ‘education lottery’ which sees the country divided into ‘lucky and unlucky children’. He believes that some of the ‘unluckiest children’ are those  living in relatively affluent areas in the Home Counties, which are let down by coasting schools. The annual report is expected to outline a blueprint for a ‘national service’ of top teachers and headteachers who are ready to be deployed to failing areas to help turn them around. The East of England and the North East in particular will be  criticised. But Sir Michael will claim the ‘battle against mediocrity’ in English education is being won, with eight out of ten schools now judged good or outstanding – the highest proportion in Ofsted’s 21-year history. A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Sir Michael is right – bad classroom behaviour is hugely disruptive to children’s  education. It means teachers can’t teach and pupils can’t learn. ‘That is why a key part of our reforms is restoring discipline in schools and why we have strengthened teachers’ powers to put them back in charge.’","English pupils lagging behind Asian countries, Sir Michael Wilshaw warns .

A Mazda RX8 sports car was completely written off after it smashes into an embankment at 70mph . The driver, who asked not to be named, said he was lucky to be alive when he saw the  damage to his car . He explained the road had been very wet on November 12 and his car hydroplaned on a patch of standing water which sent it flying into a road sign. The 38-year-old said: 'I was on my way to Canterbury city centre to pick up a few things and to grab a coffee. 'Travelling in a straight line in the outside lane, I saw the half mile sign for my turn off, so started to slowly ease into the left lane ready to exit the dual carriageway. 'All of a sudden, the left wheels of the car hit a lot of standing water that was only in the left lane, jerking the vehicle towards the bank, because of the water, the car just glided like being on black ice.' On dash-cam footage, the Mazda RX8 is seen driving along the dual carriageway in terrible conditions . He added: 'There was absolutely nothing I could do. 'I could see the road sign for Canterbury city cathedral looming closer and bigger very quickly as the car almost flew towards it. 'My thoughts were, this is going to hurt and is not going to end well.' But after the car crashed into the sign, he says he got out slightly disorientated but without any injuries.

"Pepperoni lovers are extroverts, diners who like pizzas topped with an egg are supportive and veggie fans are flirtatious. According to a study, pizza fans who pick particular toppings reveal more than their favourite flavours when they create their perfect pie. The research also revealed the compatibility of the different pizza personalities, proving that the way to a person's heart is through their stomach. Dr Alan Hirsch's study reveals that pizza toppings can say a lot about person's character . Dr Hirsch used a bespoke form of Pizza Rorschach testing to analyse the results . Smell and taste expert Dr Alan Hirsch's research showed personality traits can be summed up according to preferred pizza toppings. This sort of information is advantageous when it comes to a first date, as Dr Hirsch explains: 'You can tell a lot about someone by what they like on their pizza, which is useful when you're on a date. 'You don't just need to ask questions to get to know them; look at what they order to find out if they really are your perfect match or not.' Carbonara Roma: Fans of this egg-based pizza are said to be good with money, cynical and cautious . Mare Rossa Romana: According to the results, seafood lovers are principled, intelligent and critical . Among the other discoveries were that people who love a debate or might be described as cautious or good with money would usually opt for a creamy béchamel-based pizza. Having goat's cheese on your doughy dish means you are most likely to be sensitive and easy-going. And pepperoni lovers tend to display extrovert characteristics, while diners who like pizzas topped with an egg are supportive and trustworthy but don't naturally seek out the limelight. Meat eaters are classified as supportive homebodies whilst those who like chicken toppings are driven, competitive and assertive. The study revealed the compatibility of the different Pizza Personalities . The way to the heart is through the stomach:  If the hypothesis is right, this could lead to interesting coupling . According to Dr Hirsch lovers of spicy food tend to be a risk-takers . Dr Hirsch used a bespoke form of Pizza Rorschach testing – similar to the inkblot tests used to decipher underlying character traits – to analyse what toppings say about a person. 'It's long been known, thanks to Freud, that your personality will dictate what you look for in your food,' Dr Hirsch said. 'For example, if you like spicy foods then you tend to be a risk-taker and like the adrenaline rush that comes with it, whereas people who prefer a lot of protein in their meal are often more sociable or outgoing. 'Food can be such an emotive thing – the taste, texture, smell – and we often prefer certain foods because of an underlying personality trait.' The pizza personalities were generated using a pool of 500 British adults who took part in a comprehensive range of psychiatric and personality tests . Dr Alan Hirsch (left) says diners who choose a chicken topping are 'competitive' and 'driven' Head of Menu at Pizza Express, Holly Davies, says: 'Our work with Dr Hirsch has given us real insight into why we tend to order the same thing when we go back to our favourite restaurants. 'We're calling for people to try something different this month. You might just discover your new favourite suits your personality better – or find a new person to be compatible with.'

"Tough new A-levels will see a return to teenagers studying traditional subjects in greater depth to restore rigour to the exams. In English literature pupils will focus on eight instead of 12 texts, while in history they will examine a broader sweep of crucial events to better prepare them for university. Sixth-formers will also need to display more mathematical ability in biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, economics and psychology exams. Changes: Tougher new A-levels will see a return to teenagers studying traditional subjects in greater depth . In a separate move, coursework at A-level is set to be cut back in an effort to toughen up the exams and prevent cheating. In future, the qualifications should include coursework only if a particular skill cannot be assessed by exam, such as in geography fieldwork or art, exam regulator Ofqual said. The Government is introducing harder A-levels in most subjects from September 2015, with reformed maths, further maths and languages A-levels following in 2016. Ministers have already announced that teenagers will be tested at the end of two years – with no exams in the first 12 months – to stop courses being broken into bite-sized chunks that encourage formulaic teaching. In English literature, pupils will need to study a minimum of eight texts  including one Shakespeare play . AS-levels, currently taken in the first year of the sixth form, will become stand-alone qualifications, with marks no longer counting towards final A-level grades. Professor Mark Smith, vice chancellor of Lancaster University, chaired an independent review of A-levels and yesterday a consultation document, drawn up by exam boards and university academics, was published outlining the proposed subject content of the ‘rigorous’ new exams. In English literature, pupils will need to study a minimum of eight texts, which must include at least three works from before 1900, including one Shakespeare play, and a post-2000 work. This will enable sixth-formers to look at novels and plays in more detail. Currently, teenagers study six texts at AS-level and a further six at A-level. English literature candidates will also be examined on a previously ‘unseen’ text. ‘To prepare for examinations with “unseen texts”, students will need to read widely, broadening their knowledge and their critical and comparative understanding of literature,’ the consultation document says. In history, sixth-formers will have to study topics from a period of at least 200 years rather than the current range of 100 years, which is now considered ‘too narrow’. The focus on British history has been reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent because it was felt that pupils will have already developed a ‘good understanding’ from GCSE studies. More maths is being introduced to economics, computer science and psychology A-levels as well as the three sciences. Other changes include a new emphasis on drawing in art and design, and fieldwork being reintroduced in geography so pupils ‘relate their learning to real experiences of the world’.","In English literature pupils will focus on eight instead of 12 texts .

"The mere prospect of cash can make unethical behavior much more likely, found a study released last month. Researchers from the University of Utah and Harvard wanted to . find out exactly what kind of effect the promise of money had on . people's behavior. The study found that when people stood to gain financially, they were much more likely to behave unethically than otherwise. The price of ethics: The study found that people behave more unethically when they stand to gain financially, especially in the realm of business . 'We were interested in why good people would do bad behavior,' Kristin Smith-Crowe, a management professor and co-author of the study told CNBC. Smith-Crow of the University of Utah and Maryam Kouchaki of Harvard University used 324 university students for the study. The group was broken into two groups and took part in the same exercises - only one group was offered a financial reward for certain behavior, and the other wasn't. In one exercise, the students were presented with unethical acts and asked how likely they were to engage in the acts - one group for money, and one group for nothing. In another, they played a 'deception game,' in which one group could earn more money by lying rather than telling the truth, and the other would gain nothing from the lies. A third game allowed the students to choose to hire an employee who would share insider information if hired, and for the second group the candidate had no inside knowledge. Greed is good: Gordon Gekko's mantra rings true for a lot of top executives in the business world . In the fourth game, students engaged in a performance task in which they could earn money by being dishonest (there was nothing to gain by being dishonest for the second group). The study found that people given an opportunity for financial gain were much more likely to be unethical in their intentions, decisions and behavior than those who weren't. A sample scenario is: 'You work as an office assistant for a department at a University. You’re alone in the office making copies and realize you’re out of copy paper at home. You therefore slip a ream of paper into your backpack.' 'The study didn't ask people to do horrible acts, there were more mundane like stealing office supplies,' Smith-Crowe told CNBC. Cold hard cash: It's been said that money corrupts, but the latest study shows the mere thought of it is enough to prompt unethical behavior . 'But . it just shows how insidious this can be. These were normal people and . this is something we can all be affected by,' she said. Smith-Crowe said that when it comes to making a business decision, study participants with the promise of money set aside their moral issues across the board. It's this kind of behavior we've seen often in the downfall of major corporations: white collar crimes that begin with a small ethical misstep and snowball into huge acts of fraud. In recent years, we've seen huge corporations such as Enron and Lehmann Brothers collapse due to fraud, and Bernie Madoff who defrauded investors of almost $65 billion. Smith-Crowe said that when participants in the study had an opportunity for financial gain, they became single-minded in the pursuance of it. 'They completely lost track of everything else except pursuing their self interests,' Smith-Crowe told CNBC. 'They focused on the cost benefit of their decisions rather than how it might affect other people.' Cashing in: Study participants set aside all moral questions when making business decisions that would bring in more money . The study is just the latest in a series of academic studies that show that money corrupts. One 2012 study by the University of Michigan showed that 'upper class individuals behave more unethically that lower-class individuals', which researchers said showed a more favorable attitude towards greed. The findings show that 'the mere presence of money... can serve as a prompt for immoral behavior operating through a business decision frame,' the study notes. 'These findings suggest that money is a more insidious corrupting factor than previously appreciated, as mere, subtle exposure to money can be a corrupting influence,' it concludes. 'The next question is how business decisions can be framed so that money won't be corrupting,' said Smith-Crowe to CNBC. 'We're looking into that. We hope there's a positive story out there.'","Researchers from Harvard and University of Utah found that the mere promise of money is enough to cause people to make unethical decisions .

"Ovarian cancer patient Maria Cull, 58, from Herts . After eight rounds of gruelling chemotherapy over seven years, ovarian cancer patient Maria Cull is still holding out for a cure. Maria, 58, a former sales administrator, was first diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2007 but the cancer has since spread to her lungs, liver, kidneys and bowel. Two weeks ago, she was told that the last type of chemotherapy available to her had stopped working. 'I'm running out of options,' says Maria, who lives in Hemel Hempstead, Herts, with her husband, Ian, 56, a civil engineer. 'The gaps between treatment cycles were getting shorter and shorter as the cancer keeps returning.' Her hopes are pinned on a groundbreaking new trial combining two cancer drugs to target blood supply to tumours, destroying them, then stopping them from regrowing. The two drugs, which have not been used together before, are fosbretabulin and pazopanib. Fosbretabulin is one of a class of drugs known as a vascular disruptive agent (VDA) and destroys the blood cells supplying existing cancer cells. Pazopanib, which is licensed for kidney cancer, prevents the development of new blood vessels. Maria's consultant, Professor Gordon Rustin of the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, in Middlesex, one of the experts leading the trial, says he is 'very optimistic' about the outcome. 'The blood supply is the Achilles heel of a tumour; if you can shut that down they will shrink and be destroyed,' says Professor Rustin, who for 30 years has worked on drugs that attack blood vessels that supply tumours. 'Fosbretabulin has been around since 1998 and was developed from chemicals extracted from African bush willow bark. We know it is highly effective at destroying the blood supply to tumours.' However, Professor Rustin says the drug on its own is not enough to stop the cancer coming back, as some cells on the rim of the tumour survive and are able to develop a new blood supply, getting nutrients from surrounding healthy tissue. This means the tumour grows back, usually within months. 'We can treat women with ovarian cancer who relapse five or six times - the first period of remission is typically a year or more - but each time they relapse the period of remission get shorter. Some individuals survive for many more cycles of treatment - the record is 22.' Eventually though, as in Maria's case, the drugs stop working. 'We have been searching for another drug to use with fosbretabulin, to stop cancer cells growing a new blood supply, for several years. 'An earlier small trial we did using it in conjunction with Avastin, a drug that works in a similar way to pazopanib, was successful and we have been trying to get a larger randomised, controlled trial running for some time.' She has had eight rounds of gruelling chemotherapy and is still holding out for a cure . Experts believe that pazopanib will work even better than Avastin, and has the advantage of being taken as a pill (Avastin is given intravenously). Maria, who has three children and two grandchildren, hopes to start treatment this month in the first phase of the new trial. The aim is to find the optimum dose and what side-effects the combination produces. A further 17 patients will be recruited at Mount Vernon, the Christie Hospital in Manchester and the Royal Marsden Hospital in London. Phase two, involving 120 patients, will start recruiting in 2015, comparing the combination treatment with pazopanib alone. 'I'm still optimistic about that magic pill,' says Maria, who has already been on four previous drugs trials. It's hoped the new drug combination will improve survival rates for ovarian cancer in the same way new drug therapies have done for breast cancer. Despite being the second most common gynaecological cancer, with 7,000 women diagnosed every year, the survival rate for ovarian cancer is still low. Only 42.9 per cent of women with the disease are alive after five years - compared with 85 per cent with breast cancer. Experts say this is partly because the majority of ovarian cancer cases are diagnosed only when patients have symptoms when the cancer has spread. However, treatment options are also more limited. Maria was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in March 2007 after she started to feel full after a few mouthfuls of food - a key symptom of the disease. Others are nausea, persistent bloating and abdominal pain. 'I felt like I'd eaten a seven-course meal but usually I'd only eaten half a plateful,' she says. At first, Maria thought it was her irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) flaring up. It was a nurse performing a routine cervical smear test a year after Maria's symptoms began who urged her to see a doctor. 'I mentioned that I'd been experiencing pain during sex recently and she suggested I see my GP.' Maria's doctor noted her right ovary was enlarged and said it might be a cyst. Blood tests also showed raised levels of something called CA125, a marker for ovarian cancer, 'though I didn't know that at the time', she says. She was then sent for an ultrasound scan, which confirmed there was a growth. She was told she needed surgery to investigate. 'The nurse in the room put her arm on my shoulder, but still no one mentioned the word cancer,' recalls Maria. 'It's bought me this precious extra time' 'So when the surgeon I was referred to warned me that all the signs pointed to ovarian cancer, the news really shocked me. I was just 50 and had never had any serious health problems before. But I tried to stay positive.' Surgery confirmed it was cancer. Maria had tumours on her right and left ovary. Although the cancer hadn't spread beyond the womb, the tumour looked aggressive, so the surgeon removed her womb and ovaries. She then underwent four-and-a-half months of chemotherapy. Maria went into remission for three years. 'I went back to work and had a completely normal life - I hoped I was one of the lucky ones who had been cured.' But in August 2010, Maria developed pain in her left side - the cancer had returned, this time in her pelvis. 'It was obviously devastating but the doctors were so calm that I just got on with it,' she says. The cancer was controlled with the hormone treatment tamoxifen as well as regular scans and blood tests to monitor it, before Maria moved on to her second bout of chemotherapy in July 2011. She has since had six more rounds. Late last year, Maria took part in a trial of a new drug that could potentially make her responsive again to carboplatin, one of the main chemotherapy drugs, as it had stopped working for her. 'My lowest point came last Christmas when I was on the trial drug plus two other chemotherapy drugs,' she recalls. 'I had to spend Christmas Day in bed in hospital as I was so ill. 'The trial drug worked, though, and made me respond to carboplatin again. By February, I felt much better, and in May we had a holiday in Antigua.' Sadly, that treatment has stopped working again, and Maria was switched to another chemotherapy regimen. Two weeks ago, she was told that drug had also failed. 'People wonder why I have persevered with chemotherapy for so long because it obviously has side-effects, which have made me extremely ill at times.' She adds: 'But it's bought me this precious extra time and I've made the most of it - going on holiday, seeing my daughter and younger son marry and my grandchildren born. 'I'm amazed that however black things might look, my specialists always have a plan for the next step and something else we can try. Because of them, I've never given up hope. 'Even if this trial drug combination doesn't work for me I hope the research will help other women with ovarian cancer and other cancer patients. For me, that means it has to be worth a shot.' Commenting on the new trial, Louise Bayne, chief executive at the charity Ovacome, says: 'Ovarian cancer remains an incredibly difficult disease to cure. Sadly, we lose 4,800 women to the disease each year. We sincerely hope this trial is successful and that it provides some long-awaited hope for women and their loved ones.' ovacome.org.uk .","Ovarian cancer patient Maria Cull, 58, is still holding out for a cure .

"Big tobacco has jumped en masse into the e-cigarette market and will have an unlikely competitor in tech billionaire Sean Parker, who’s also recently entered the growing fray. On Tuesday, Altria Group Inc. announced the details of its foray into the market with an electronic cigarette branded MarkTen. Starting in August, the company says it will launch the product in Indiana. Altria, which owns the nation’s biggest cigarette maker, Philip Morris USA, became the last of major tobacco companies to take the plunge and, oddly enough, they were also behind billionaire former Facebook president Sean Parker. New digs? Newlywed tech billionaire Sean Parker, left with wife Alexandra Lenas, has joined a chorus of investors in NJOY, an e-cigarette company. He also joins the three big tobacco firms, who all now have their own brands . The newlywed tech founder is also newly invested in NJOY, a leader in the battery-powered, cigarette alternative market. Parker recently invested $10 million in the Arizona-based company, which also has an investor in musician Bruno Mars and a spokeswoman in troubled rock musician Courtney Love. ‘There's a huge opportunity to transition the entire world away from dangerous, carcinogenic, combusting cigarettes,’ Parker told the Wall Street Journal. If he’s right, he and his tobacco company competition are in for a big pay day. Making bets: #1 tobacco maker Altria, owner of Philip Morris, also recently joined the fray, announcing Tuesday their plans to market MarkTen, a new cigarette brand . The market for e-cigarettes, which includes more than 250 brands, has grown from the thousands of users in 2006 to several million worldwide. Analysts estimate sales could double this year to $1 billion. Some go as far as saying consumption of e-cigs could surpass consumption of traditional cigarettes in the next decade. Popular: #2 tobacco company Reynolds American Inc. has already launched its Vuse brand e-cigarette, while third place Lorillard recently acquired Blu eCigs . And that’s only 1 percent of today’s total tobacco market. During an investor presentation on Tuesday, Altria CEO Marty Barrington said the company has ‘spent a good deal of time studying the category and the business opportunity.’ ‘The category is in its early stages and time will tell how it will evolve,’ Barrington said. Electronic cigarettes are battery-powered devices that heat a liquid nicotine solution, creating vapor that users inhale. Devotees say e-cigarettes address both the addictive and behavioral aspects of smoking. Smokers get their nicotine without the more than 4,000 chemicals found in regular cigarettes. And they get to hold something shaped like a cigarette, while puffing and exhaling something that looks like smoke. MarkTen, made in China by a contract manufacturer, is expected to sell for about $9.50. The liquid for the cartridges is being produced in the U.S. Last week, Reynolds American Inc., owner of the nation's second-biggest tobacco company, announced that it is launching a revamped version of its Vuse brand electronic cigarette in Colorado in July, with its sights set on expanding nationally. Lorillard Inc., the nation's third-biggest tobacco company, acquired e-cigarette maker Blu Ecigs in April 2012 and has expanded to more than 80,000 retail outlets. Bets on e-cigarettes may seem promising but they’re still not a sure thing. The move toward e-cigarettes by tobacco . makers comes at a time when the once mighty industry is in decline. In . 1965, 42 percent of adults smoked, according to the CDC. In 2010, that . number was at 19 percent. Celebrities: Parker invested $10 million in NJOY, a leader in the market. The company has previously produced a 'webisode' ad starring Courtney Love and counts musician Bruno Mars among its investor/spokespeople . In demand? A woman smokes at Vape New York store. E-cigarettes make up about 1 percent--$1 billion--of the tobacco market, which investors see as room to grow, but where skeptics see only false hope. However, some of the same forces slowing down demand for traditional tobacco could affect the battery-powered stuff. The Food and Drug Administration plans to assert regulatory authority over e-cigarettes in the near future. Public health officials say the safety of e-cigarettes and their effectiveness in helping people quit regular smokes haven't been fully studied. According to the Washington Post, three states have thus far banned the use of e-cigarettes in enclosed indoor spaces and the industry could face some of the same steep taxation that has become the foe of cigarette companies and a weapon wielded by governments in their war against tobacco use. Promising? E-cigarettes for sale at Vape New York. Investors like Parker believe demand for the gadgets could one day reach that of traditional cigarettes . Despite all the hopeful attention given to the burgeoning industry, not everyone is convinced of its promise. ‘This industry is in decline, whether people want to admit it or not,’ tobacco industry expert Jack Russo told the Post. ‘It's far too early to be calling this the next horizon. There's still a lot of question marks.’ Russo called big tobacco’s embrace of the once-miniscule industry ‘almost a desperation-type behaviour.’Meanwhile, Sean Parker remains hopeful. ‘The clever application of technology might someday obsolete the combustion cigarette,’ he said, ‘and all the harm it causes.’ Doubtful: E-cigarette flavor drops for sale at Vape New York. Skeptics, meanwhile, point to fears of government regulation and small market share as signs the cigarette replacements will fail turn high profits .","The three biggest tobacco makers are now in the electronic cigarette game and hope for a big return on the little gadgets .

"More scandal: Haringey council's former head of children's services Sharon Shoesmith (above), who was sacked over the Baby P case, presided over another child abuse crisis involving the neglect of ten youngsters . The shamed council boss at the centre of the Baby P case has presided over another child abuse scandal, it emerged yesterday. A damning report into the horrific neglect of ten children in Haringey, North London, blamed ‘wholly dysfunctional’ management at the council department meant to protect them – led by Sharon Shoesmith. Police found the children, aged from eight months to 16 years, filthy, starving and covered in lice following a tip-off from a member of the public in  April 2009. An independent report into the case said the family had been known to Haringey Council’s social services department since July 2002 – seven years before the children were rescued. It blamed a ‘wholly dysfunctional’ management culture for social workers’ failure to spot they were being abused. The management of the department, it found, was ‘overbearing’, ‘dysfunctional’ and ‘shouty’. The report added: ‘Anxiety bred a culture of harassment and bullying.’ It said the management style left staff ‘demotivated’ and feeling unable to challenge decisions. It also noted there was a high turnover of staff who dealt with the family. Miss Shoesmith, who is not named in the report, was in charge of children’s services in the borough between April 2005  and December 2008, most of the time that the family was being monitored. She was sacked over the Baby P case and is battling for compensation of £1million. In February 2006, all ten of the boys and girls were placed on a Child Protection Register. Damages claim: Miss Shoesmith is battling for compensation of £1million after being sacked over the case of Baby P (above) who died from abuse in 2007 . But despite social workers being refused access to the house and facing ‘open hostility’ from the parents, the children were removed from the register ten months later. The report found that between January 2007 and April 2009,  no social worker, police or health professional saw the children’s bedrooms. After they repeatedly failed to turn up at school, Haringey’s Education Welfare Service manager wrote a desperate email to social services in December 2008. It read: ‘How can we rule out neglect if no-one has seen the children?’ The reply came back  that their case did not ‘meet  the threshold for any kind of strategy meeting’. The report found: ‘By April 2009, when the children were taken into police protection, it is the view of the Review Team that they had been allowed to live in appalling conditions for at least five months too long. The appropriate action of police came too late for these children.’ The children’s mother was jailed for 18 months in April last year  for child cruelty, but has now  been released. Her ex-partner was also jailed for five child cruelty offences.  Last year the Supreme Court refused to allow an appeal against a ruling that Miss Shoesmith was unfairly dismissed. Peter Connelly, known as Baby P, went on Haringey’s child protection list eight months before he died from abuse in August 2007, aged 17 months. Councillor Lorna Reith from Haringey Council, said: ‘This review covers a period when there were serious shortcomings in our children’s safeguarding services and we apologise unreservedly for the past failures identified.’",Case presided over by shamed boss Sharon Shoesmith .
"Ecuador is about to be hit by eastward-moving waves of warm water, resurrecting hopes that El Niño may be on its way. El Niño - a heating of sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific - affects wind patterns and can trigger both floods and drought in different parts of the globe. The most recent waves increase the chances that parched California could be in for some relief - albeit small - if weather patterns take a turn later this year. Scroll down for video . El Niño refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an area along the Equator in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean becomes hotter than usual. The waves of warm water are pictured . But Nasa has warned that 'fickle' El Niño will likely be weak if it does appear, providing only limited relief for a drought-ridden west coast. Around 430,000 acres of land will be left fallow in California - because there hasn't been enough rain or snow coming from the nearby mountain ranges. Prospects had been fading for an El Niño event this year, but now there's a glimmer of hope for a modest comeback. Nasa recently spotted areas of higher sea level indicating warmer than normal water in the Pacific Ocean. Now crossing the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, these warm waves, known as Kelvin waves, appear as the large area of warmer-than-normal ocean temperatures hugging the equator. Kelvin waves of high sea level (red/yellow) are seen crossing the Pacific Ocean at the equator. The waves may be due to El Niño events. Green indicates normal sea level, and blue/purple areas are lower than normal . The Kelvin waves are travelling eastward and should arrive off the coast of Ecuador in late September and early October. El Niño refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an area along the Equator in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean becomes hotter than usual. The average water temperature in that area is typically between 1 and 3°C (approximately 2 and 5°F) warmer than normal during this event. This has the effect of adding huge amounts of heat and moisture into the atmosphere, ultimately affecting patterns of air pressure and rainfall across the Pacific and globally. Strong El Niño events occur every 20 years or so, but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming. At the opposite end of the scale, La Niña is the climatological counterpart to El Niño. La Niña refers to periods when sea-surface temperatures around the Equator are cooler than normal. This has a similar affect on air pressure and rainfall because it suppresses how much heat and moisture enters the atmosphere. Climatologist Bill Patzert of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, warned it's too early to know for sure, but he would not be surprised if the latest Kelvin waves are the 'last hurrah' for El Niño. 'Since February 2014, the prospect of an El Niño has waxed and waned,' he said. 'This late in the season, the best we can expect is a weak to moderate event. What comes next is not yet clear. 'But for the drought-plagued American West, the possibility of a badly needed drenching is fading,' continued Patzert. If it appears, this year's El Niño is expected to be mild. However, scientists expect extreme weather events fuelled by unusually strong El Niños will double this century. The worst El Niño on record, in 1997 and 1998, was blamed for massive flooding along China's Yangtze river, responsible for killing more than 1,500 people. The impact of extreme El Niño events is felt by every continent, and the event in 1997 cost up to £27.4 billion ($45 billion) in damage globally. Extreme El Niño events develop differently from standard El Ninos, which first appear in the western Pacific. The extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28°C develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. Around 430,000 acres of land will be left fallow in California - because there hasn't been enough rain or snow coming from the nearby mountain ranges. Pictured is a mud flow along Mud Creek Canyon in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest which  may be related to California's prolonged drought . The sea temperature as seen from space on September 18.

"Teenagers in Britain still lag far behind their counterparts in the Far East in tests on reading, maths and science, a damning report will show tomorrow. Worldwide rankings will reveal that the UK has ‘simply stagnated’ since the last analysis four years ago – despite £30billion being poured into education by Labour. Last night, Education Secretary Michael Gove said the results were a ‘verdict on the last government’ as his reforms had not yet taken effect. Test results in Britain's schools have not improved in four years despite billions of pounds being spent on improving education . The latest analysis is expected to reveal that Britain’s position has not improved since the previous study in 2009 by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. That showed Britain had slumped behind poorer nations such as Poland and Estonia, falling from 17th to 25th in reading, from 24th to 28th in maths and from 14th to 16th in science. The 2013 analysis is expected to reveal that Britain is still far behind countries such as China, South Korea and Singapore. The conclusions were based on tests on 500,000 pupils in 65 countries. Mr Gove said: ‘The results due out this week are a verdict on the last government. These tests were taken in 2012 by children educated almost entirely under Labour and before most of our reforms had even been introduced. The real test of our reforms will be how we do in a decade’s time. In the past, these tests have shown that, despite constantly rising exam results, our performance stagnated as others raced ahead.’ Nearly 12,500 students in the UK sat the two-hour problem-solving tests, known as Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), in 477 secondary schools. Britain’s expected poor showing in maths will cause particular  concern and the report will highlight the lack of maths teachers with degrees in their subject. In the 2009 OECD study, around a fifth of 15-year-olds in Britain failed to gain the minimum standard for their age in literacy and maths. The Chinese city of Shanghai, which had the top-performing pupils in the tables, scored 600 points to the UK’s 500 in maths. Former head teacher Sir John Rowling called on schools to give pupils mock PISA papers to improve their chances against bright teenagers abroad. Michael Gove has said the latest test results will not reflect the changes which have been made under the coalition reforms . The chairman of the Performance in Excellence Club, which helps  schools boost exam results, said: ‘Every test, from driving tests to Oxbridge exams, people prepare for them. But I have never ever known anybody prepare for PISA.’ He told the Times Educational Supplement: ‘Make no mistake – on December 3 the morale of the profession will take another whack around the ears. It is almost certain.’ Yesterday Labour’s education spokesman Tristram Hunt said the report will be a ‘wake-up call for UK schools policy’. He added that Britain needed to learn from China’s emphasis on good teachers and expectation of good results from every child. ‘All [Michael Gove’s] frenetic, attention-seeking changes have not delivered the step change in standards we need,’ he added. Alison Wolf, professor of public sector management at King’s  College London, said support for pupils at home was also vital. ‘If you are growing up in Seoul or Shanghai, you go home from school to a family that cares desperately about your education, no matter what its social standing is. British parents are simply not as aware of how important education is.’","Organisation for Economic Co-Operation asseses the world's 15-year-olds .

"Divers have found a bizarre alien 'slime' in water-filled underground caves beneath Australia’s Nullarbor Plain. Researchers were stunned to find life in the deep cave. They reported unique ‘curtains’ of biological material now known as Nullarbor cave slimes. A 'curtain' of slime found by Australian divers in water-filled underground caves beneath Nullarbor Plain . The researchers say the organisms that make up the Weebubbie cave slime community survive in a very unusual way – by oxidizing ammonia in the salty . cave water. They are completely independent of sunlight and ecosystems . on the surface, the researchers say. Researchers Sasha Tetu, Katy Breakwell, Liam Elbourne, Andrew Holmes, Michael Gillings and Ian Paulsen from Macquarie University are exploring how this alien ecosystem works. They published their findings this week in the journal of the International Society for Microbial Ecology, showing that an unusual combination of microbes thrive in the Weebubbie caves in the underground system. 'Earlier studies on the community suggested that there was an unusual chemistry going on in the caves, but we didn’t know how the microbes were making a living in the cave environment,' says the lead scientist Professor Ian Paulsen of Macquarie University. In order to find this ‘missing link’, the team of researchers made use of a range of new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing of environmental DNA and scanning electron microscopy to take an in-depth look at the composition of the Weebubbie cave slime community. They found a dominant group of organisms in the cave slimes, known as the Thaumarchaeota. This community of microbes thrives in the total dark, independent of photosynthesis. The alien cave slime under a microscope: The slime community survive by oxidizing ammonia in the salty water and are completely independent of sunlight and ecosystems on the surface . Another of the alien slime communities found in the cave . It is thought that the inundations of the Nullarbor caves by the sea occurred a number of times in the past and so researchers suggest that the Weebubbie Thaumarchaeota may have a marine origin. 'We know that the Nullarbor Plain’s karst system arose from the sea in the Middle Miocene period and so this may be a clue as to where the Weebubbie Thaumarchaeota came from,' says Professor Paulsen. The research team says this analysis shows that the organisms that make up the Weebubbie cave slime community survive by oxidizing ammonia in the salty cave water – and are completely independent of sunlight and ecosystems on the surface. 'It just goes to show that life in the dark recesses of the planet comes in many strange forms, many of which are still unknown,' says Professor Paulsen.

"A deaf five-year-old girl due to undergo surgery in a hospital reduced to rubble by the Oklahoma tornado has finally had the operation after a nurse dug her hearing implant out of the debris. Jayde Scholl, a Chinese orphan adopted by an American doctor last year, was due to have a cochlear hearing device implanted in her ear last week. But the implant, which costs between $25,000 and $30,000, was lost when the Moore Medical Center was destroyed during the storm which wrecked 20,000 homes and killed 24 people last Monday. Jayde's operation was then postponed indefinitely while doctors considered the logistics of finding a replacement implant. Happy ending: Jayde Scholl, aged five, can be seen smiling as doctors test out her cochlear implant after a nurse found the missing device among the rubble of a hospital destroyed in the Oklahoma tornado . Before the storm: Jayde had been due to undergone the surgery at the Moore Medical Centre in Oklahoma . Tragedy: The Moore Medical Center was left as just a shell of the building after a tornado hit the area in Oklahoma last Monday . Speaking after the storm, Jayde's adoptive mother Jaque Scholl told kjrh: 'Well, her device is somewhere between Dallas and Kansas. I have no idea. I don't know what happens when a tornado takes the device away.' When nurse Sherry Raper heard about Jayde's predicament, she spent hours digging through the rubble until she found the computer-sized box holding Jayde's implant. Mrs Scholl said: 'The staff wanted something good to happen this week. They wanted Jayde’s journey to keep moving forward. An amazing community of folks have helped make this happen in the midst of so much tragedy.' Jayde underwent a successful surgery at the Norman Healthplex on Friday morning - meaning the five-year-old can finally hear in both her ears. Search: Nurse Sherry Raper spent several hours searching through the rubble of the Moore Medical Center in the aftermath of the tornado to find the cochlear implant . Success: After the cochlear implant was retrieved, Jayde Scholl was able to undergo an operation to have it placed in one of her ears . Jayde Scholl, who was unable to speak, hear or use sign language last year, can now hear in both ears after she had one cochlear implant in February and her second on Friday . The schoolgirl had previously undergone the cochlear implant surgery to correct the hearing in her other ear in February. A cochlear implant is an external device that receives the sound through a microphone, computer processes the sound and delivers the information to an internal device placed under the skin. But at one time, it was thought Jayde would never be able to hear. Jayde was placed in a Chinese orphanage after she was found abandoned by her birth mother in a town square when she was just eight-months-old. She had no access to medical treatment to help improve her hearing until she was adopted by Jaque Scholl, a doctor of audiology at the speech and hearing clinic Scholl Center, and her family last year. The family then concentrated on helping Jadye, who was unable to speak, hear or use sign language, to be able to hear for the first time by organising for the five-year-old to have cochlear implants in both ears. Giving hope: Jayde's adoptive mother, doctor Jaque Scholl, said staff at the Moore Medical Center, pictured after the storm, wanted some good to happen in the aftermath of the tornado . The cochlear implant was in a storage cupboard at the Moore Medical Center, pictured, in Oklahoma when the storm hit. Nurse Sherry Raper remembered where it had been stored and set out to find it .","Five-year-old Jayde Scholl was unable to speak, hear or use sign language .

"The Mexican government will use satellite technology to stem the tide of illegal immigrants fleeing to America on top of huge freight trains nicknamed La Bestia or ‘The Beast’. People desperate to escape the poverty of the south clamber aboard the slow-moving trains and sit on the roof as they trundle north towards the US-Mexican border. The trains are also used by traffickers to get people into the United States. Thousands of Central American migrants ride the trains, known as La Bestia, or The Beast, during their journey through Mexico to reach the US border.Some of the immigrants are robbed and assaulted by gangs who control the train tops, while others fall asleep and fall off losing limbs (file picture) Announcing $450,000 to be spent on improving tracks that have been neglected for years in six southern states, Humberto Mayans, the head of the federal government's southern border improvement plans, said that a dozen satellite-monitored vehicles will be used ahead of cargo trains near Mexico's southern border with Guatemala. It is here that many of the immigrants get onto the trains as they head north. The Beast stops at Ixtepec, Mexico and yet more illegal immigrants - from the old to the very young - clamber aboard on their way to the US-Mexico border where they will try to illegally enter America . The new scheme is meant to 'prevent migrants from putting at risk the safety of the trains which are for cargo, not passengers,' Senor Mayans said. The improvements will prevent derailments and allow the trains to speed up thus preventing people climbing aboard in the first place. Some of the immigrants are robbed and assaulted by gangs who control the train tops, while others fall asleep and fall off losing limbs or being crushed under the wheels of the trains. The sign says 'Welcome Migrants' as The Beast pulls into the Hermanos en el Camino immigrant shelter in Ixtepec, Mexico . The number of migrants increased at the beginning of this year but has dropped over the past couple of months. It is believed that the drop is due to more stringent border patrols, raids on The Beast, drug gangs, coyotes and an American-financed advertising campaign warning of the dangers of the journey. Last month, President Enrique Pena Nieto announced that he would try to secure Mexico’s border with Guatemala and introduce better border crossing facilities and improved regional co-operation. End of the line (almost): The Beast arrives at  Ixtepec, Mexico. From there the illegal immigrants will begin their final assault on America - and a new life or a daily battle with immigration agents from the Department of Homeland Security who will attempt to track, detain and deport them .","Train nicknamed The Beast travels to Mexican border with U.S.

"You won’t hear Tristram Hunt, Labour’s new education spokesman, trotting out Labour’s jibe that David Cameron is a ‘posh boy who doesn’t know the cost of a pint of milk’. Because the urbane and artfully tousled Hunt, 39, is every bit as posh as the Prime Minister. Fees at his alma mater, University College School in Hampstead, North London, are nearly £18,000 a year. It is a member of the ‘Eton Group’ of elite private schools and to get in you have to pass a gruelling exam. Ambition: Tristram Hunt, Labour's new Shadow Secretary of State for Education, interacts with pupils during a visit to a children's breakfast club at Richard Atkins Primary School in Brixton, London . Hunt went to Trinity College, Cambridge, the same college as his father, Baron Hunt of Chesterton, a Labour peer and Companion of the Order of the Bath. It was thanks to his dad’s Royal connections that Hunt was able to marry wife Juliet at Westminster Abbey, where William and Kate walked down the aisle. Add a commanding height of 6ft 3in, languid good looks that made him a TV success as the ‘Naked Historian’, and Peter Mandelson as a Labour ‘Godfather’, and it is not surprising he oozes charm and confidence. Yet, sitting in his cramped Commons study, Hunt begins the interview, his first since being appointed Shadow Education Secretary in Ed Miliband’s reshuffle, with a public apology. When Michael Gove launched his free schools revolution after the 2010 Election, allowing parents to set up new schools and breaking the stranglehold of teachers’ unions and town hall chiefs, Labour claimed it was a wicked plot to let middle-class parents set up elitist state schools where their pampered children studied Latin while council estate kids were condemned to ‘bog-standard comprehensives’. Days after becoming the newly elected MP for Stoke-on-Trent, excitable new boy Hunt called free schools a ‘vanity project for yummy mummies’. Partner: Mr Hunt's wife Juliet Thornback, who owns a successful homeware company could be a Labour 'SamCam' in the making . Now he wants to eat his words. ‘I regret those comments because I think any parents, be they yummy mummies or .  .  . ’ he searches for the male equivalent, ‘ .  .  . or faddy daddies, involved in the education of their children is great.’ Instead of mocking Gove, Hunt now wants to mirror him, by promising Labour’s own ‘parent power’ revolution in schools. He wants to bury the idea that Labour is in the pockets of teachers’ unions and Lefty town hall chiefs after the party’s pollsters discovered Gove’s policy is a vote winner. Labour’s schools will be called ‘parent-led academies’ (PLAs) – not free schools. But it’s a case of spot the difference. It is a highly significant moment. Miliband’s party conference speech, in which he vowed to freeze energy prices, was seen as a lurch to the Left, as was his decision last week to demote three Blairite members of his Shadow Cabinet. Yet the appointment of Blairite young gun Hunt, and ending attacks on ‘yummy mummies’ who set up their own schools, suggests ‘Red Ed’ is willing to steal the Tories’ clothing if he thinks it will win him votes. Like free schools, PLAs will be set up by local parents and teachers and will be able to set their own curriculum, decide teachers’ pay and have their own ‘ethos’. However, unlike free schools, PLAs will only be allowed where there is a shortage of school places; town halls will still be able to step in – though only in a crisis – and there will be curbs on ‘untrained’ teachers. Hunt says the checks will stop scandals such as the closure of  the Muslim Al-Madinah free school in Derby following claims of  discrimination against female staff and pupils. But make no mistake, PLAs are meant to be seen as ‘Labour’s free schools’. ‘There are lots of parents out there who want to set up schools,’ says Hunt. ‘What I am saying is if you want to do that when we are in government we will be on your side. There has been this perception that we would not be, and I want people to be absolutely clear that we are. I am putting rocket boosters on getting behind parents and social entrepreneurs. ‘We are not going to go back to the old days of the local authority running all the schools – they will not be  in charge.’ Taunt: Mr Hunt has accused his opposite number Michael Gove of acting like Napoleon when it comes to education policy in Whitehall . Far from shutting down Gove’s ‘yummy mummy schools’ if Labour wins, Hunt wants more of them. ‘We will keep those free schools going. We aren’t in the business of taking them down. We have to clear up this question which has dogged Labour education policy since we entered opposition and since Michael Gove began his reforms, as to what we’d do. We just want to say, “You are setting up these schools, we are behind you.” ’ Hunt has praised the successful free school set up in East London by his friend, Peter Hyman, Tony Blair’s former No 10 aide. Would he let Hyman set up a primary school feeder to his existing secondary free school? ‘Yes.’ Even if it is a free school? He interjects: ‘We would be calling them parent-led academies.’ Will PLAs offer everything free schools have got? ‘Yes, but in an area of need, absolutely,’ Hunt enthuses. ‘The innovation, creativity, community engagement you  see in the best free schools – great, let’s have more.’ Controversy: The new Shadow Education Secretary once referred to David Starkey as a 'gossip columnist' historian, prompting the academic to say Mr Hunt was more eye candy than IQ . To ram home the point, Hunt says he would happily send his three young children to a free school. Gove will argue that by giving town halls even a small role, Labour’s PLAs are not truly free but still enslaved to the Left-wing educational establishment he despises. Hunt counters by claiming that by running free schools from Whitehall, Gove is acting ‘like ‘Napoleon’. ‘When things go wrong at a free school it has to go straight to the Minister down the road like a  Napoleon telling these kids what to do,’ he scoffs. Gove, the state-educated, adopted son of an Aberdonian fishmonger, loves to taunt ‘privately educated’ Hunt in private. ‘I get under Michael’s skin,’ he says. In return, he has called Gove ‘Blair’s bastard acolyte’ for claiming free schools are a continuation of Blair’s academies. Hunt once got under TV rival David Starkey’s skin, cheekily calling him a ‘gossip columnist’ historian, prompting Starkey to  suggest Hunt was more eye candy than IQ. Teasing Tories for following Blair is a bit rich considering Hunt’s undying devotion.  ‘Tony Blair was a great Prime Minister,’ he says. So is he the true heir to Blair, a future leader, as Labour admirers claim? ‘No, partly for psychological reasons,’ he reflects. ‘Tony had a messianic quality, a driven quality – not in that he was the Messiah!’ Hunt erupts with laughter, ‘but a driven, absolute inner eye. Am I the new Tony Blair? I don’t think that would be true.’ He would have you believe he is too cerebral for the ruthlessness  of leadership. Or does the soft-spoken, self- deprecating demeanour mask the deadly ambition of other well-mannered public schoolboy politicians such as Blair and Cameron? Hunt’s Cameronesque qualities extends to his own ‘yummy mummy’ wife, Juliet Thornback, a Labour ‘SamCam’ in the making. Even more blonde and willowy than her husband, she co-owns the trendy Thornback & Peel homeware company whose first success was  a designer handbag, just like Mrs Cameron, who designs handbags for her own upmarket label Smythson. B&Q it is not: Thornback & Peel wallpaper sells for £70 a roll and silk cushions for £55. Proud husband Hunt declares: ‘She is a very hard-working, successful small businesswoman worried about cash flow and big companies not paying their bills within 60 days – while raising three kids. I’m full of admiration for her.’ Dave says the same about Sam. As a rather grand commentator on constitutional affairs, Hunt has  frequently doled out advice to the Royals. Indeed, if he did so to a camera lens outside Buckingham Palace he is more likely to be mistaken for Prince William than Ed Miliband. He laughs when I suggest he is probably one of the few who knows as much about Marxism as Miliband’s father, Marxist academic Ralph, did. Hunt wrote a highly acclaimed book about his hero,  Friedrich Engels, who co-founded Communism with Karl Marx. While planting the seeds of a worldwide workers’ revolt from England, German-born Engels simultaneously indulged his passion for riding to hounds. Does English gent Hunt share Engels’s love of fox-hunting? Envisaging an embarrassing fall at his first fence, novice political chaser Hunt mumbles something vague about fox-hunting being ‘part of English culture’. It’s not a ‘yes’, though it might sound like it to a traditional Tory supporter tempted to vote Labour. On the other hand, an anti-bloodsports Labour voter might interpret it as ‘no’. Which is how Tony Blair won three elections for Labour.","Shadow Education Secretary Tristam Hunt wants to mirror Michael Gove .

"Rocketing numbers of parents are fraudulently trying to get their children into the country’s best state schools. They are being caught using false addresses, pretending to be Roman Catholic, lying about siblings and even impersonating family members in an attempt to secure places. Over the past five years, the number of council investigations into suspicious applications has risen almost 11-fold, a Daily Mail investigation has found. Getting them in: Parents are being caught using false addresses, pretending to be Roman Catholic, lying about siblings and even impersonating family members in an attempt to secure places (file picture) The number of sanctions imposed – school places withdrawn or applications not accepted – has risen more than threefold over the same period. The findings reveal the lengths desperate parents are prepared to go to prevent their children ending up in ‘sink’ schools. Education experts believe the figures are the ‘tip of the iceberg’ because some councils are more proactive in investigating than others. Tens of thousands of pupils are set to lose out on their first choice secondary school on National Offer Day on Friday. In some areas, half of them are expected not to gain their first preference. The Mail submitted Freedom of Information requests to all 152 local education authorities in England on fraudulent applications for primary and secondary schools between 2007/8 and 2013/14. For 2007/8, 96 councils responded. Of these, 36 gave full or partial data and the rest either did not collect the information or cited exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act. Caught: Medway Council in Kent withdrew four primary places last year after it found families fraudulently used grandparents' or childminders' addresses . Applications of 99 children were probed which led to 38 sanctions. In 2012/13, 91 councils responded, with 61 giving full or partial data. Applications for 1,059 children were investigated, leading to 129 places being withdrawn or not accepted. From 2007/8 to 2012/13 there were 2,599 investigations and 516 sanctions. Extrapolated across the country, this equates to 7,573 investigations and 1,595 sanctions over the period. Most probes relate to accusations that parents are registering a family member’s address or renting a property in a catchment area. Some also claim false sibling links. In 2012/13 in Wolverhampton, five places were withdrawn due to parents using incorrect addresses, including a family member ‘posing’ as a child’s father. Medway Council in Kent withdrew four primary places last year after it found families fraudulently used grandparents’ or childminders’ addresses. Knowsley Metropolitan Council in Merseyside withdrew  11 places from 2008/9 to 2012/13 due to ‘false Catholic baptism’ claims. In another case, ‘parent A’ tipped off Buckinghamshire County Council last year about ‘parent B’ no longer living at the address provided. The school place was withdrawn from ‘B’ and given to ‘A’. Hertfordshire County Council has seen an eight-fold rise in investigations, from 56 in 2008 to 455 last year. Professor Alan Smithers, of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: ‘We owe it to parents to defend admissions against unscrupulous competition and fraudulent activity. 'This is probably the tip of the iceberg as it’s not being investigated as much as it should be.’ Mrinal Patel became the first parent to face prosecution for allegedly lying about her address to gain a school place. Harrow Council in North-west London accused the 41-year-old of giving her mother’s address when applying to the over-subscribed Pinner Park First School. 'False address': Mrinal Patel appeared at Harrow Magistrates' Court in May 2009 and denied fraud by false representation . She faced up to a year in jail or a £5,000 fine after the council used the Fraud Act 2006 to prosecute her over the school application for her five-year-old son Rhys. Mrs Patel appeared at Harrow Magistrates’ Court in May 2009 and denied fraud by false representation. However, two months later the council withdrew its action after being advised that the Act could not be applied to her case, and it was believed it could be open to challenge. The case prompted Labour’s Ed Balls, then Schools Secretary, to order a review to look at possible loopholes. At the time, Mrs Patel told the BBC that Harrow’s decision not to launch the ‘disproportionate’ action against her showed she was innocent. But she admitted she had said on the application form that she had lived at the address for 14 years, when in fact she had stayed there for only four weeks. The mother of three claimed she wrote this figure because her mother had been living at the address for 14 years. She had been ‘under a tremendous amount of stress’ at the time. Her mother’s home was walking distance from the school that was rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted and received more than 400 applications for 90 places. Mrs Patel said: ‘When they rang to check with me and asked if I was still living there, I said no. I never tried to hide anything.’ She also revealed that she had received hate mail over the case. Harrow Council was unable to provide details about fraudulent school applications in response to the Mail’s FOI request. It said: ‘If we find a place has been offered using a fraudulent address, we would withdraw the offer if the child has not started at the school. There have been a very small number of cases where this has been necessary over the past five years.’","Parents caught using false addresses and pretending to be Roman Catholic .

"More than 200 armed federal agents and snipers were deployed on Tuesday to forcibly remove the cattle of a Nevada rancher - signaling a dangerous escalation in the two-decade long constitutional land dispute over an endangered tortoise. Cliven Bundy, the last rancher in Clark County, Nevada, has been battling the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) since 1993 when he refused to pay for the right to graze on the 600,000-acre Gold Butte land he says his family have owned since the 1870s. Claiming that the government has 'brought everything but tanks and rocket launchers', Bundy said his livelihood is being taken away from him by agents carrying, 'Automatic weapons, sniper rifles, top communication, top surveillance.' Scroll down for video . Defiance: Cliven Bundy, (right), and friend, Clance Cox, stand at the Bundy ranch near Bunkerville Nevada on Saturday during the escalation of their dispute with the Federal Government . 'The battle’s been going on for 20 years,' Bundy told theWashington Free Beacon from his ranch 75 miles outside of Las Vegas. 'What’s happened the last two weeks, the United States government, the bureaus are getting this army together and they’re going to get their job done and they’re going to prove two things. 'They’re going to prove they can do it, and they’re gonna prove that they have unlimited power, and that they control the policing power over this public land. That’s what they’re trying to prove.' Eight helicopters are routinely circling the land and as of Wednesday, federal officials have seized 234 of Bundy's 908 cattle. It is estimated that impounding them will cost upwards of $3 million. The BLM says Bundy's cattle have been trespassing on U.S. land without required grazing permits for over 25 years. Pressure and surveillance: A helicopter takes off from a staging area of Bureau of Land Management vehicles and other government vehicles off of Riverside Road near Bunkerville, Nevada over the weekend . Property: Cattle belonging to Cliven Bundy are rounded up with a helicopter near Bunkerville Nevada on Monday, April 7, 2014. The Bureau of Land Management has begun to round up what they call 'trespass cattle' that rancher Cliven Bundy has been grazing in the Gold Butte area 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas . However, Bundy said he doesn't recognize federal authority on land that he says belongs to the state of Nevada. The BLM has released a statement on its website regarding the matter, saying, 'Cattle have been in trespass on public lands in Southern Nevada for more than two decades. 'This is unfair to the thousands of other ranchers who graze livestock in compliance with federal laws and regulations throughout the west. 'The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the National Park Service (NPS) have made repeated attempts to resolve this matter administratively and judicially.' Speaking to the press on the outskirts of his land, Bundy said, 'I have raised cattle on that land, which is public land for the people of Clark County, all my life. Constitutional: Contractors for the Bureau of Land Management round up cattle belonging to Cliven Bundy with a helicopter near Bunkerville, Nevada on Monday . Control: A Bureau of Land Management ranger stands guard at the entrance of a staging area near Mesquite, Nevada on Saturday, April 5, 2014 . Rights: A helicopter takes off from a staging area of Bureau of Land Management vehicles and other government vehicles off of Riverside Road near Bunkerville . 'Why I raise cattle there and why I can raise cattle there is because I have preemptive rights,” he said, explaining that among them is the right to forage. 'Who is the trespasser here? Who is the trespasser on this land? Is the United States trespassing on Clark County, Nevada, land? 'Or is it Cliven Bundy who is trespassing on Clark County, Nevada, land? Who’s the trespasser?' Consistently through his 20-year struggle with the federal government, the veteran rancher has maintained that Washington has no right to order him from the land. The Bureau of Land Management has 'overstepped its boundaries by not letting me access my rights, not recognizing state’s sovereignty, and having over 200 armed officers watching our every move and stealing our cattle,' Bundy said. Resilient: Cliven Bundy, right, and Clance Cox, left, stand at the Bundy ranch near Bunkerville in defiance of the Federal Government . Conference: Cliven Bundy speaks on a phone in his home near Bunkerville, Nevada on Tuesday as he battles the confiscation of his cattle . Free speech?

The situation escalated on Sunday after Cliven Bundy's son, Dave Bundy, 37, was arrested for filming federal agents while outside an area designated for First Amendment activity on the restricted property. He was held overnight. He claims he was beaten for 'exercising his First Amendment rights' and did not resist arrest as officers claimed. Cliven Bundy's daughter, Bailey Bundy Logue was appalled that her brother was arrested for taking pictures ont he families ancestral land. 'That is against our First Amendment right,' Logue said. 'They say it’s a First Amendment area, but we have rights everywhere. Since when have we had First Amendment areas? That’s not what it says in the Constitution.' Indeed, Nevada's governor has criticized the cattle roundup and what he calls ""intimidation"" in the dispute. Help: Supporters prepare to rally for Cliven Bundy at the Bundy ranch near Bunkerville Nevada on Monday . On Wednesday, officials from the federal Bureau of Land Management and National Park Service didn't immediately respond to Gov. Brian Sandoval's call for the BLM to 'reconsider its approach and act accordingly' in the ongoing roundup of about 900 cattle roaming a vast area about half the size of the state of Delaware. Savage: Dave Bundy, son of embattled Bunkerville rancher Cliven Bundy claims he was taken into custody by federal agents on Sunday afternoon along state Route 170 near Mesquite. He was released Monday after being issued citations for failing to disperse and resisting arrest . 'No cow justifies the atmosphere of intimidation which currently exists nor the limitation of constitutional rights that are sacred to all Nevadans,' Sandoval said in a statement released after business hours Tuesday. The showdown pits Cliven Bundy's claims of ancestral rights to graze his cows on open range against federal claims that the cattle are trespassing on arid and fragile habitat of the endangered desert tortoise. The Republican governor weighed in after several days of news coverage and radio talk show commentary about blocked roads and armed federal agents fanning out around Bundy's ranch while contractors using helicopters and vehicles herd cows into portable pens in rugged and remote areas. Sandoval's comments came the same day the U.S. Senate confirmed Neil Kornze, a Nevada native, as the new BLM director. Kornze is a natural resource manager who grew up in Elko and served previously as a senior adviser to Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid. Sandoval is a former state attorney general and federal district court judge in a state with deep roots in states' rights disputes including the Sagebrush Rebellion of the 1970s and '80s. Nevada was among Western states where ranchers challenged federal ownership of land they said was theirs. People power: People help erect a pole to hang a banner during a rally in support of Cliven Bundy near Bunkerville Nevada on Monday . The governor said he was most offended that armed federal officials have tried to corral people protesting the roundup into a fenced-in 'First Amendment area' south of the resort city of Mesquite. Dispute: The desert tortoise lives primarily in the southwest of the United States and has seen its population decrease by up to 90 percent in recent years . The site 'tramples upon Nevadans' fundamental rights under the U.S. Constitution' and should be dismantled, Sandoval said. BLM spokeswoman Kirsten Cannon and Park Service spokeswoman Christie Vanover have told reporters during daily conference calls that free-speech areas were established so agents could ensure the safety of contractors, protesters, the rancher and his supporters. The current roundup covers a dusty, windswept 1,200-square-mile area dotted with hardy mesquite and yucca, wispy cheatgrass and scenic rock formations north of the Lake Mead reservoir. The dispute between Bundy and the federal government dates to 1993, when land managers cited concern for the federally protected tortoise and capped Bundy's herd at 150 animals on a 250-square-mile rangeland allotment. BLM spokeswoman Cannon said Bundy has racked up more than $1.1 million in unpaid grazing fees while disregarding several federal court orders to remove his animals. We shall not be moved: John Banks holds up a banner during a rally in support of Cliven Bundy near Bunkerville Nev. Monday, April 7, 2014, 2014. The Bureau of Land Management has begun to round up what they call ""trespass cattle"" that rancher Cliven Bundy has been grazing in the Gold Butte area 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas . Bundy estimates the unpaid fees total about $300,000. He notes that his Mormon family's 19th century melon farm in the Virgin River bottomland and ranch operation in surrounding areas predates creation of the federal Bureau of Land Management in 1946. BLM and Park Service officials see threats in Bundy's promise to ""do whatever it takes"" to protect his property, and in his characterization that the dispute constitutes a ""range war."" But since the cattle roundup began Saturday, there has been one arrest. Bundy's son, Dave Bundy, 37, was taken into custody Sunday as he watched the roundup from State Route 170. He was released Monday with bruises on his face and a citation accusing him of refusing to disperse and resisting arrest. A court date has not been set. His mother, Carol Bundy, alleged that her son was roughed up by BLM police. Meanwhile, federal officials say 277 cows have been collected since Saturday in the rangeland that has been closed to the public through May 12. A roundup contract totals $966,000. Cannon said state veterinarian and brand identification officials will determine what becomes of the impounded cattle.","Cliven Bundy is appealing for help to stop the Federal Bureau of Land Management and the FBi from removing his 900 or so cattle .

"Dennis Hope, 66, claims to own the moon and has made more than $10million selling acres of it since 1980 . A businessman claiming to sell acres of land on the moon has made more than $10million (£6.million) from the venture. Dennis Hope, 66, says he exploited a loophole in the 1967 UN Outer Space treaty to claim ownership of the lunar landscape. He then divided it into plots and sold them in his local bar and over the internet via his company, Lunar Embassy, for $20 (£12) an acre, or $25 (£15) including mineral rights. Hollywood actors Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, and Clint Eastwood, and Star Wars creator George Lucas are said to be among his six million customers. Presidents Reagan, Carter and Bush Junior have also had plots bought for them, while companies such as Hilton and Marriott have also invested. Hope has even set up his own state, the Galactic Government, in 2004, which has a ratified constitution, a congress, a unit of currency and even a patent office . Each owner gets a gold-embossed certificate and an entitlement to vote in any future elections. Mr Hope, a former used car salesman, researched the law on land-grabs on Earth before writing to the United Nations to lay claim to the moon. He did not receive a reply refusing his request, and therefore considers himself to have a legal right to the moon and all its minerals. He also claimed ownership of most of the other planets in the solar system, and their moons, at the same time. He said: 'I couldn't help thinking that there was a lot of unclaimed property up there. 'I was intrigued enough to look up the treaty and sure enough Article Two states 'no nation by appropriation shall have sovereignty or control over any satellite bodies'. Mr Hope says a loophole in the UN Outer Space Treaty allowed him to claim ownership of the moon,and other planets because the treaty forbids countries from doing so, not individuals . Mr Hope has even set up his own government, the Galactic Government, which has its own constitution and currency. He claims the state doesn't have to abide by UN laws because it is not a member . 'I found a lot of countries accepted that land could be claimed so I just applied what I learned. 'People have said just because the UN never responded doesn't mean you own it. Well, I did my due diligence, they should have done theirs.' Mr Hope, from San Francisco, came up with the idea of laying claim to the moon while on a cross-country drive in the late 1970s. He started selling the plots in his local pub before going online as the internet grew. He said: 'I'd sit in bars, with a batch of deeds in my coat. I'd get talking to someone and they asked what I did, I'd say, ""I sell the moon"". 'It was a great conversation starter. I made a lot of sales that way.' Mr Hope now has plans to build a giant pyramid on the moon, with room for thousands of visitors. He said it is unlikely anybody will live there permanently because it could lead to medical complications. Mr Hope has so far sold moon land to to the likes of sci-fi master George Lucas, former President George W Bush and Hilton Hotels. Each owner is given a certificate and the right to vote in any moon elections . But he does believe people will have 'extended vacations' of up to three months at a time to get the 'best views in the solar system'. A leisure company even plans to open an indoor golf course. Dennis's biggest sale so far is 2.6 million acres to one person. But he says he turned down a 'massive' offer - worth 'hundreds of millions of dollars' - because the company wanted to buy the polar regions. Mr Hope said: 'That's where the frozen water is and they're not for sale. Any company that owned it would have a monopoly on the moon's water supply and would exploit it.' The youngest land owner on the moon was a day old and the oldest 97. Unsurprisingly, Mr Hope's business venture has landed him in court on numerous occasions. He said: 'I've been taken to court in Germany and Sweden for fraud but both cases were thrown out of court because of lack of jurisdiction. 'No court wants to tackle the issue yet, but I'm sure they'll be cases in the future.' Others have sent him abusive letters and emails, and at least four bomb threats have been made against the business. He added: 'They call me a con man and a charlatan and that no one can own the moon for himself. 'I just turn them over to the FBI and let them deal with them.' Mr Hope claims to own the moon due to a legal loophole in the UN Outer Space Treaty, but some legal minds beg to differ . Mr Hope claims he exploited a hole in the 1967 UN Outer Space Treaty in order to claim ownership of the moon, most of the planets in the solar system, and their moons as well. He says the treaty only specifies that countries may not lay claims to ownership, but says nothing about individuals. So is owning an acre of the moon legal? Article VI of this treaty states: 'The activities of non-governmental entities in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate State Party to the Treaty.' So while Mr Hope is not excluded under the country clause, he could be excluded because he has not been authroised by the U.S. government. Tanja Masson-Zwaan, deputy director of the International Institute of Space Law, previously told the National Geographic that all UN treaties apply to both countries and their citizens, which would disqualify Mr Hope's claims. She added: 'What Lunar Embassy is doing does not give people buying pieces of paper the right to ownership of the moon.' However, Henry Hertzfeld, a space analyst at George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, explained to CNN in 2008 that the treaty has little legal power because it is too difficult to enforce. 'These treaties don't really have any teeth to them,' he said. 'They are agreements on principle.' In fact several governments, including that of Germany and Sweden, have tried to prosecute Mr Hope for fraud, but he says the cases have fallen flat over a lack of jurisdiction.","Dennis Hope claimed ownership of moon in 1980 through legal loophole .

"Terrance Brown is trying to get the NSA to turn over his phone records to help clear his name . A man on trial for an armed bank truck robbery is trying to get the National Security Agency to hand over his phone records to help clear his name. Terrance Brown is accused of masterminding the robbery which left an armored car messenger dead in October 2010. Prosecutors have used phone records to show that four other gang members were in the area at the time of the crime in South Florida. But they say they are missing a month of Brown's . records from two phones because his service provider at the time, . MetroPCS, no longer has them. Brown's attorney Marshall Dore Louis has filed court paper saying that the Justice Department is required to turn over the phone records if they exist because they could be crucial to his client's defense. He says it is likely that the NSA collected data on Brown's calls and that the defense is entitled to access the records because they may show Brown wasn't involved in a previous July robbery attempt. 'The government must be ordered to turn over the records for the two telephones that it attributes to Mr. Brown for the dates which are relevant to this case,' Louis said in the motion. U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenbaum initially told the Justice Department to respond by the end of Wednesday but granted a request from prosecutors for an extra week. They must respond to whether disclosure of the data - if they exist - would harm national security. Brown and five . others are accused of attempting to rob several armored cars outside . banks in Broward County on October 1, 2010. Prosecutors say the group's attempt to rob a Brinks . messenger resulted in a shootout and the killing of Brinks employee . Alejandro Nodarse Arencibia. The actual triggerman, Nathaniel Moss, pleaded guilty to several charges and is serving a life prison sentence. Brown, accused of being the mastermind, and the others currently on trial pleaded not guilty. The judge also said she would review whether the NSA surveillance, authorized by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, was legally conducted. The NSA program and another surveillance effort known as Prism came to light last week when The Guardian published classified material leaked by Edward Snowden, a former employee at an NSA contractor. Brown's attorney is appealing to the Justice Department for phone records potentially kept by the National Security Agency. Pictured is the NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland . Snowden is now in Hong Kong and said he revealed the surveillance programs because he believes they are an unwarranted and possibly illegal government intrusion into privacy. Although the one leaked court order mentions only Verizon phone records, numerous U.S. officials have said the phone data surveillance program covers many other service providers. The program has been in place since 2006 and reauthorized several times by Congress. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who has litigated national security cases, said he hadn't heard of this approach being used in court before. 'The chances that he will succeed in pulling these calls out of the bowels of the federal government are rather slim,' Turley said. But he said it would make for a novel case because the government usually invokes some sort of protection against disclosure, but in this case it has already acknowledged the program. 'It would be interesting to see if the government would claim a national security privilege,' Turley said. He noted that the past 48 hours have already seen 'an explosion of demands in litigation' challenging the government's phone records collection program. 'It was a game-changer when the government acknowledged the program, and you're going to see additional lawsuits in the next few weeks and months,' Turley said.","Terrance Brown is accused of masterminding robbery that killed messenger .

"By . Jaya Narain for MailOnline . When father-of-two Kamal Hussain received a letter from school saying classes would be ending early for staff development, he duly arranged for his children to have the afternoon off. But he became suspicious when he spotted three teachers in smart clothing driving past him when they were meant to be at school for the ‘inset’ (which stands for ‘in-service training’) afternoon. Calling in at the deserted school, he was told by a cleaner that the head and teachers had gone to a colleague’s wedding. Angry: Kamal Hussain (left), from Oldham, was furious that his children's school shut up shop for a wedding.

"British taxpayers will have to pay more than £800million after the European Union spent nearly £6billion in ‘error’ last year. Auditors yesterday refused to sign off the EU accounts for the 19th year in succession as they revealed that the spending errors are 23 per cent up on the year before. While countries across Europe were forced to rein in spending, EU bosses paid out £5.7billion to ineligible projects, of which Britain’s share is £832million. Questionable: The annual report reveals the amount of unexplained spending has risen and the books have not been given a clean bill of health for the 19th year in a row . The rate of errors increased from 3.9 per cent to 4.8 per cent of spending, a rise of nearly a quarter. The European Court of Auditors found . that supervision and control of Brussels spending worth another . £117billion was only ‘partially effective’. The fraud affects all areas of EU spending, the watchdog said. Rural spending was the worst area, with 7.9 per cent of the €15 billion (£12.6billion) rural development expenditure made in error. This means about £1billion was wrongly paid out by beaurocrats. 6.8 percent of the €40.7 billion (£34.3billion) spent on regional policy, energy and transport was also spent in error. That mistake cost more than £2 billion. Vitor Caldeira, the president of the . ECA, warned that a backlog of bills ‘will put added pressure on EU cash . flows and may increase the risk of error over the next few years’. Attack: David Cameron also attacked the refusal of the European Commission to make cuts to its bloated bureaucracy at a time when countries are slashing the cost of governments at home . Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: ‘It is about time the peoples of Europe . were able to get this EU albatross off their backs, or at least out of . their pockets.’ Pawel Swidlicki, from the Open Europe think-tank, said the auditor’s . report is proof that the EU’s budgeting procedures are ‘fundamentally . flawed’. The . European Commission is forecasting the recovery across the 28-countries . will continue into the second half of the year, albeit at a slowpace. The . executive arm of the European Union said it expects the region's . economy to grow by 0.5 per cent over the second half of the year and be . flat for the whole year. In its previous forecast in May, it predicted a 0.1 percent annual decline. It also expects the 17-country Eurozone to continue its recovery from recession in quarterly terms. However, over 2013 as a whole, the Eurozone is still expected to have contracted 0.4 per cent. In 2014 though, it is penciling in 1.1 percent growth. The Eurozone's unemployment is expected to remain at its record-high of 12.2 per cent this year and next. Last year, the European Court of Auditors said the budget was riddled with fraud and error – and that the situation was getting worse. Tory critics said the finding strengthened the case for going beyond a freeze and cutting the EU’s vast budget. David Cameron also attacked the refusal of the European Commission to make cuts to its bloated bureaucracy at a time when countries are slashing the cost of governments at home. Philip Bradbourn MEP, Conservative spokesman on Budgetary control, told The Telegraph: 'Another year, another story of lax monitoring and shambolic control. 'I understand full well that much of the misspending occurs when member states fail to exercise proper supervision of spending within their borders, but the fact is that the EU must accept ultimate responsibility for what happens to the money it dishes out. 'Every year we are told the Commission is serious about tackling the problem. Every year it gets still worse. It is shameful to the EU's integrity and unacceptable to its taxpayers. 'If you found misappropriation and mis-spending on this scale in a commercial business - or in a properly-accountable public administration - there would be sackings all round. In Brussels, it's ""Carry on Squandering"".' A European Commission spokesman has disputed that taxpayers would have to pay £800m, saying it would be clawed back.","European Union spent nearly £6billion in 'error' last year .

"A Texas federal judge has accused the Department of Homeland Security of delivering children smuggled into the United States to their illegal immigrant parents. U.S. District Judge Andrew S Hanen filed a court order late last week claiming that in more than one case before his court, immigration officials had arrested human traffickers and then delivered the children being smuggled 'to the custody of the parent illegally living in the United States.' This action makes the DHS complicit in aiding that Mexican drug cartels that control the people smuggling rings, says Hanen, adding that the 'government is not only allowing [illegal immigrants in the U.S.] to fund the illegal and evil activities of these cartels, but is also inspiring them to do so.' Reunited: Judge Hanen says the DHS is reuniting children with their illegal immigrant parents in the U.S. after intercepting people smugglers . The court order containing Hanen's accusations was filed against Mirtha Veronica Nava-Martinez who attempted to smuggle a 10-year-ol El Salvadorean girl to the U.S. where her mother is living illegally. The child's mother Patricia Elizabeth Salmeron Santos has 'solicited human traffickers to smiggle' her daughter from El Salvador to Virginia where she was living. 'The criminal conspiracy instigated by Salmeron Santos was temporarily interrupted when Nava-Martinez was arrested,' wrote Hanen. 'Despite this setback, the goal of the conspiracy was successfully completed thanks to the actions of the United States Government.' Despite knowing that Salmeron Santos had instigated the illegal conduct, she was not arrested but gained the outcome she had desired, says Hanen: 'the DHS delivered the child to her - thus successfully completing the mission of the criminal conspiracy.' Judge Hanen noted that it was the fourth such case to come before his court in as many weeks. Danger: Hanen wrote that if the DHS continues to 'choose not to enforce U.S. law' it places children in danger and costs U.S. taxpayers money . Hanen accused the Obama Administration of allowing illegal immigrants to avoid deportation  and 'chosen not to enfore the United States' border security laws,' he wrote. Hanen wrote that his court is 'quite concerned with the apparent policy of the Department of Homeland Security of completing mission of individuals who are violating the border security of the United States.' In addition to aiding and abetting people smugglers, Hanen wrote, the DHS is costing U.S. taxpayers money in the form of travel and accommodations to get the children to their parents and in one case 'flew a child to multiple locations.' A common occurrence: The Texas judge said the case of Salmeron Santos was one of four that had come through his court in as many weeks . Fox News reports that in the case of Salmeron Santos, a federal prosecutor requested that the mother be placed in immigration proceedings but that it's unclear whether or not that has happened. Hanen also noted that he is 'not unsympathetic' to the plight of the parents and children in these cases, but that it is the children who are at risk if the DHS continues to allow smuggled children to be reunited with their parents. He wrote that while some are transported across the border in cars, others are 'made to swim the Rio Grande or other bodies of water in remote areas.' 'These entities [drug cartels] are not known for their concern for human life,' Hanen wrote. 'They do not hire bonded childcare providers to smuggle children. By fostering an atmosphere whereby illegal aliens are encouraged to pay human smugglers for further services, the Government is not only allowing them to fund the illegal and evil activities of these cartels, but is also inspiring them to do so.'","U.S. District Judge Andrew S.

"Teachers demanded a 20-hour a week limit on classes yesterday to maintain a healthy ‘work/life balance’. Union members called for a rigid 35-hour week, with little more than half given over to teaching children. Five hours would be used for planning, preparation and assessment ‘at a time and place of the teacher’s choosing’ – meaning at home in most cases. Taking to the streets: A National Union of Teachers protest in Newcastle . The remaining ten hours would be set aside for other ‘non-contact’ duties including marking and going to meetings. The proposal came at the end of a . heated eight-day period during which annual conferences held by three . teaching unions were used to repeatedly attack the policies of Education . Secretary Michael Gove. The working hours motion of the . National Union of Teachers – which was passed by an overwhelming . majority and will be linked to planned strikes over pay, pensions and . conditions – would mean teachers taking classes for just four hours a . day on average. Many schools would have to hire extra staff, putting . greater pressure on budgets. Cutting teaching workloads is one of . the demands in the current dispute with Mr Gove that has led to a series . of regional strikes from this summer, followed by a national strike . before Christmas. The teachers complain that they spend too much time outside lessons marking and preparing for parents evenings, leaving them without time to have meetings or plan lessons . Critics were swift to accuse the union . of being ‘out of touch’ with reality. Craig Whittaker, a Tory MP on the . Commons education select committee, said: ‘You can’t change these . things in the current economic climate. ‘It just shows how incredibly out of touch the unions are with what’s going on in the real world.’ Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for . Real Education, said teachers should have their hours ‘expanded, not . diminished’. He added: ‘In the independent sector it is normal to have . 60 hours of contact time a week. They are living in fantasy land if they . want 20 hours per week.’ He said the hours of work should be . made less stressful by giving them greater powers to suspend or exclude . disruptive pupils. The NUT saved its bombshell for the last motion of . its five-day conference in Liverpool. Cambridgeshire primary school . teacher Richard Rose said: ‘We’re fed up with arriving at 7.45am ... and . most people are there until 6.30pm. ‘During that time there is no time to . go to eat, no time to talk, no time to think, no time even to go to the . toilet in many cases. Christine Blower, general secretary of the NUT, lead criticism of Education Secretary Michael Gove  who has faced calls to resign from most teaching unions . ‘Then, after the day’s work, what do . you do when you get home? Do you relax? I’m sure you all know – another . two, three, four hours of work. The number of emails you get after . midnight, people sending each other plans, targets, data, things like . that is incredible.’ Teachers were sacrificing time with . their own children, he said, adding: ‘If you complain to management . about that they say “Maybe teaching’s not for you then”.’ Adarsh Sood from Lewisham in . South-East London said: ‘We will fight in all the ways we can to win a . model contract which clearly defines the weekly limits on working hours . for teachers.’ Earlier in the day, delegates chanted: ‘Gove must go’ as they passed a motion of no confidence in the Education Secretary. Teachers are contracted to work 195 days every year, with five set aside for training. They typically spend 22.5 hours taking classes each week, meaning the proposal would significantly reduce contact time. But they complain contracts include a clause to carry out ‘reasonable additional hours’, meaning they end up working longer. Coventry delegate Christopher Denson . said official figures showed secondary school teachers work 50.2 hours . per week on average and primary school colleagues give 49.9 hours of . their time. He added: ‘It is essential that what is already NUT policy for a 35-hour week becomes a reality.’ The NUT and NASUWT are holding a . series of regional strikes followed by a national strike later this year . over pay, pensions and conditions. Some teachers are already operating . on a work-to-rule basis. The working hours motion – during . which teachers also called for smaller class sizes – is the latest point . of friction between teachers and Mr Gove. They have also clashed with him over . issues such as changes to the curriculum and the end of modular . qualifications. The Department for Education said it was for schools to . organise the hours and workloads of staff. A spokesman added: ‘By scrapping . unnecessary paperwork and bureaucracy we are making it easier than ever . before for teachers to focus their efforts on teaching and learning.’","National Union of Teachers demand 35-hour limit on working week with 20 hours set aside for teaching children .

"Former England hero Paul Gascoigne has been sectioned under the Mental Health Act and placed on a three-day emergency detox following his latest alcohol binge. Gascoigne, the ex-Newcastle, Tottenham and Rangers star who retired in 2004, was rushed to hospital at 3am on Friday morning after police were called to his home in Dorset. The 47-year-old had to be assessed by medics just hours before the police arrived at his house in Poole. His condition was considered to be stable however he has reportedly worsened over the next 12 hours. Paul Gascoigne pictured last week with Mandy Thomas, who is rumoured to be his new girlfriend . Former Tottenham midfielder Gascoigne represented England for 10 years between 1988 and 1998 . Gascoigne, pictured scoring against Scotland at Euro 96, was a key player for the Three Lions during the 90s . Gascoigne has suffered a long battle with alcoholism and was previously sectioned six years ago. Close friend and former teammate Gary Mabbutt told The Sun: 'He has been detained for his best interests. Paul has had a relapse and hasn't been well for a couple of weeks now. 'The best support available is being given to Paul. Hopefully he can get on the road to recovery.'

Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne, pictured fishing in Hampshire last month, was previously sectioned six years ago and has had a long battle with alcohol and drugs . Gascoigne during his days playing for England, when he made 57 appearances for his country . The star, who made 57 appearances for his country, has been in rehab seven times and was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008, following an incident at a Newcastle hotel. His seventh stint in rehab was in January this year when he checked into a £6,000-a-month treatment clinic in Southampton. The most recent binge comes just months after he was hospitalised for an alcoholic breakdown. In August he was found collapsed outside his home clutching a bottle of gin and was taken to Poole Hospital where he was treated for four days. Last month the star was pictured cradling a chicken whilst enjoying a pint and speaking to locals in a pub beer garden. But things for the troubled footballer appeared to be on the up after he was spotted with walking hand-in-hand with a woman who he is reportedly dating. Friends had said last week that they hoped Mandy Thomas, a public services worker, would save him from his battle against alcohol after she stayed by his side during his most recent relapse. Ms Thomas, who is separated from her husband and has two children, is said to be 'besotted' with the star with whom she has become 'inseparable'. A spokesman for his former club Spurs told the newspaper: 'We are aware of the situation with Paul and continue to offer our support.' Gascoigne's agent Terry Baker told MailOnline that the star 'is not very well' but refused to comment on his condition any further.","Paul Gascoigne was taken to hospital at 3am on Friday .

"Npower chief executive Paul Massara has warned Britain needs new energy infrastructure as the country's spare generation had fallen to five per cent . Britain could be at risk of blackouts by next winter, the boss of one of the Big Six energy companies has warned, as old power plants are closed and have not yet been replaced. Npower chief executive Paul Massara said Britain needs new energy infrastructure as the country's amount of spare generation at peak times had fallen from 15 per cent to five per cent this year. Mr Massara said the shortfall raised concerns over the possibility of blackouts as soon as next year. Mr Massara told the BBC's Panorama programme investors needed clarity over energy policy to be provided by the Government, in order for new plants to be built. He said: 'The amount of spare generation at the peak has gone down from about 15 per cent to this winter when we'll be about five per cent. Next winter will be even smaller. 'So will we get through this winter? Yes. Will we get through next winter? I don't know.' The warning came as the chief corporate officer of ScottishPower today warned the Government's carbon tax, which charges companies for burning fossil fuels, could make the country 'even more vulnerable to the threat of blackouts'. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Keith Anderson said the green levy will force coal-fired plants to close too quickly. In October the National Grid warned the risk of blackouts this winter was at its highest for six years as Britain's reserves of electricity had halved in 12 months. The report said Britain would have ‘margins’ of only 5 per cent, the lowest since 2007, as it headed into the freezing months. In October the National Grid warned the risk of blackouts this winter was at its highest for six years as Britain's reserves of electricity had halved in 12 months . The margin is the difference between the peak demand and the available supply from the UK’s power stations and import pipelines. If it gets too low, National Grid can issue warnings to generators to begin producing more electricity to prevent a shortfall developing. But if these warnings do not work and the margin between supply and demand reaches zero, then parts of the country could experience blackouts. National Grid director Chris Train however insisted the lights would not go out. He said: ‘While there have been power station closures since last winter, the information suggests that the market can meet demand in cold weather. But as the system operator, we’re never complacent.’ The number of coal-based power plants operating in the UK has fallen because of EU legislation which has caused older, polluting, fossil fuel plants to be turned off. One fifth of the UK’s coal capacity has been closed down in the last year because of the EU’s emissions rules. The number of coal-based power plants operating in the UK has fallen because of EU legislation which has caused older, polluting, fossil fuel plants to be turned off . A prolonged cold snap, such as the one seen earlier this year, could drain the UK’s gas reserves as millions of families keep the heating on to ward off the chill. The amount left in Rough, the UK’s largest store, hit a record low earlier in the year after freezing temperatures lasted longer than expected. Last March Britain came within hours of running out of gas after one of the under-sea pipes that imports gas from the Continent broke down. Critics said it showed that the country needed to build more gas storage facilities. Currently the UK has enough gas storage for only 21 days, while European neighbours can hold enough gas for 100 days. All of the Big Six energy companies have announced price rises this year, with E.On the last to do so on Friday when it unveiled a 3.7 per cent increase. Demonstrators hold placards as they march to the Npower headquarters, in London during a protest against energy prices last month . The size of that increase took into account the Government's roll-back of green levies, which is expected to knock £50 off the average family's fuel bill. In last week's Autumn Statement George Osborne confirmed a plan announced earlier in the week by the Department of Energy and Climate Change to make changes to green levies. In total, the Government claims green taxes add £112 to the average bill. The changes announced yesterday will reduce household's bills by £50 and bring the average bill rise down from £120 to £70 a year. The Chancellor announced that the Energy Companies Obligation, an insulation scheme delivered by energy providers, will be extended for two years until March 2017, shaving £30-£35 off the average bill next year. A further £12 rebate on electricity bills will also be added and families will also benefit from a reduction in energy network costs, saving them £5.","Npower chief executive warns Britain needs new energy infrastructure .

"Stephen Hawking's seminal book (pictured) is among the 10 voted 'most valuable' to humanity by members of the British public . Throughout history, books have disseminated the ideas and discoveries of the world’s most influential thinkers. Now a new survey has shown that half of the top 10 ‘most valuable’ books – as voted by the British public – were written by eminent scientists. The poll by The Folio Society set out to select the most valuable works to the human race and authors of those picked include Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, as well as George Orwell and Harper Lee. Two of the top three titles were written by scientists. Darwin’s The Origin of Species gained 35 per cent, while Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time gained 17 per cent. But the Bible was voted the most valuable text overall with 37 per cent of the votes. Interestingly, 37 per cent of people living in the south of the UK voted for Charles Darwin’s seminal scientific tome, but 41 per cent of northerners opted for the Bible. The study, conducted by YouGov for the publisher, asked over 2,000 members of the British public which three books from a list of 30 they considered to be the most valuable. The measure for selection was not by popularity or by the enjoyment experienced in reading the book. The Bible (pictured) was voted the most valuable text overall with 37 per cent of the vote. Interestingly, 37 per cent of people living in the south of the UK voted for Charles Darwin’s seminal scientific tome, but 41 per cent of northerners opted for the Bible . Participants were asked to rate the influence and significance their selected books have had on the modern world. Other scientific works included: Relativity by Einstein with 15 per cent of the vote and Principia Mathematica - a three-volume work on the foundations of mathematics by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell – with 12 per cent of votes. The Double Helix, which is an autobiographical account of the discovery of the structure of DNA written by James D. Watson, also made the cut in tenth place. Classic works of fiction also made up the top 10, including George Orwell’s dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, which came in fifth place and Harper Lee’s classic To Kill A Mockingbird at number seven. The survey by The Folio Society set out to select the most valuable works to the human race and authors of those picked include Albert Einstein, (pictured left) Charles Darwin (right) and Stephen Hawking, as well as George Orwell and Harper Lee . 1) The Bible (37%) 2) The Origin of Species (35%) 3) A Brief History of Time (17%) 4) Relativity (15%) 5) Nineteen-Eighty-Four (14%) 6) Principia Mathematica (12%) 7) To Kill a Mockingbird (10%) 8) The Qur’an (9%) 9) The Wealth of Nations (7%) 10) The Double Helix (6%) A total of 78 per cent of people picked their most valuable books because they answer fundamental questions of human existence. Some 64 per cent of people said titles ponder the meaning of life and explore answers, while 56 per cent said they contain guidelines of how to be a good person. Tom Walker, Editorial Director at The Folio Society, said: ‘The results of the survey highlighted some interesting dynamics, with A Brief History of Time on the list -surely one of the most under-read bestsellers ever written, - relatively little on economics despite the financial climate and only two overtly political, fiction titles in the list. ‘The first question I had was whether the similar figures for Darwin and the Bible does show a continuing polarisation between the realms of science and religion, or whether in fact it reveals a more balanced approach to ideas for the modern reader. ‘How different might the survey have looked a hundred, or even thirty years ago? How might it look in another thirty years – will Darwin have taken over; will the worrying rise of Nineteen Eighty-Four’s relevance continue; might the Qur’an continue to rise in significance in the UK; or might advances in DNA technology mean that The Double Helix grows in stature? ‘Is it perhaps a list of which books are perceived as having influence or giving understanding, rather than those which we personally read in order to understand the world around us? ‘Given the age of the majority of titles perhaps our greatest influence on how we understand the world is nowadays as much through media as through books.’ Just two works of fiction made the top 10 - 1984 (pictured left) and To Kill A Mockingbird (right), which the Editorial Director at The Folio Society notes are both highly political .","Survey by London-based publisher The Foilo Society ranks the 10 'most valuable' books, as voted for by the British public .

"Propaganda? A European Commission official said it needs to 'start early' to convince children of the merits of the EU . The European Union has been accused of trying to 'brainwash' children after pupils all over the country were given pencil cases with its logo emblazoned across it. The brightly-coloured pencil cases featuring the EU's 12-star logo were handed out to schoolchildren following an event encouraging teachers to forge links with the Commission. The one-day conference was staged by Staffordshire County Council and was attended by 50 teachers to raise awareness of the EU in schools, it was reported. However, critics fear the event and the subsequent gifts to pupils were attempts to brainwash schoolchildren into backing the EU. 'Taxpayers will . be shocked to read the cash they pay to Brussels is being spent in this . way. If schools want children to know about the EU, there are plenty of . unbiased resources,' Andrew . Allison, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, told the Express. 'Teachers don’t need to go to expensive conferences, and schools don’t need to buy books from the EU bookshop.' Meanwhile Paul Nuttal, Ukip MEP, added that it was 'utterly wrong' that an organisation representing a 'highly controversial political position' should be allowed to spread its message in to schools. The EU Commission denied the pencil . cases amounted to propaganda, or that the conference had a political . slant. Instead event's focus was to explore funding opportunities for . the EU. The EU Commission (pictured) has produced a lesson plan using aggressively pro-European leaflets . The scheme was part of the EU Comenius programme, aimed at schools, colleges and councils across and supported by the British Council, an EU spokesman said. A total of 438 UK schools were funded to forge links with European counterparts in 2011, the spokesman told the Express, adding: 'The UK authorities vigorously promoted British involvement.' Staffordshire County Council's cabinet member for schools, Liz Staples, said the event - which cost £3,500 - was 'purely educational' and there was no cost to the taxpayer. Staffordshire County Council is understood to have received a formal complaint from a resident about the conference, which was held in November, which its legal department is now looking in to.",Moves follow teacher conference on how to promote the EU in schools .

"Too tight! The school deemed Lauren's close-fitting trousers unacceptable . It is usually the norm that a schoolgirl would be reprimanded for her skirt being too short. But in this case, one pupil was sent home because her trousers were not flared enough and deemed far too tight. Teachers also made Lauren Entwistle learn in isolation at Swavesey Village College in Cambridgeshire, because the offending black school trousers did not have the correct 'flarage'. Her mother Mandy Entwistle, 37, today said she was furious her daughter missed a day-and-a-half of GCSE lessons just because her trousers were the wrong style. She said the school had banned various styles of trousers because they were deemed fashionable, but she had decided the bootcut version that they ask pupils to wear looks untidy and can get caught in bikes. Bizarrely, the school has now ordered Lauren new trousers, which they deem suitable, from the same website as the original ones. Mother-of-four Ms Entwistle said: 'I just do not understand how sending a child home from school because her trousers are too tight around the ankles is beneficial for anybody. 'Are we supposed to get a tape measure out and measure the flarage? 'I could understand if they were too tight in case they are distracting for the boys, but that is not the issue. 'I bought them from a school uniform website. I would not send her to school in leggings. I always make sure she looks smart. 'When I was at school bootcut trousers were banned because they were in fashion and not straight trousers are banned because they are in fashion. 'I think the flared trousers do not look very smart as they often get caught in their bikes or shoes. 'The school say they want the pupils to behave like young adults and then they treat Lauren like a child over some trousers. 'She wears the trousers to work at her hair salon and they are considered smart enough - so if they are appropriate for the world of work they should be good enough for school.' The seething mother, who runs her own cleaning business, added: 'Lauren is a well-behaved pupil and despite her interest in beauty she respects the rules and does not have her nails done or wear make up to school. 'I refuse to let them put Lauren in the isolation room is like a prison cell - it is like something out of a torture camp. 'They will make them wear orange jumpsuits next.' Lauren, who lives with her mother and stay-at-home father Allen, 40, in Swavesey, Cambridgeshire, was sent home at about 10am on Monday and missed the rest of her lessons that day. Mandy sent her back to school on Tuesday, but Lauren had to work in the teachers’ office missing her favourite lesson, health and beauty. Furious mother Mandy said: 'I just do not understand how sending a child home from school because her trousers are too tight around the ankles is beneficial for anybody.' Her outraged mother cannot believe the GCSE student has missed a day and a half of lessons just because of the style of her trousers . She was allowed to take part in lessons on Wednesday after the school ordered Lauren some new trousers - which Mandy says came from the same uniform website she originally used. Swavesey Village College today confirmed it has clamped down on their uniform policy, which they say helps them deliver 'very high standards.' The school’s uniform policy states that girls must wear bootcut trousers to ensure everyone is dressed the same and to prevent girls wearing leggings. A source at the school confirmed there is an isolation room, but said pupils are given work to do and supervised by staff. Andrew Daly, acting headteacher at Swavesey Village College, today said the school is rated 'outstanding' and expects 'very high standards.' He said: 'Part of these expectations is a very clear uniform policy, that in consultation with parents and students we apply fairly and consistently. 'We explained before the summer our expectations about uniform and girls’ trousers in particular to ensure they are appropriate. 'All parents were given the summer to arrange for the correct uniform to be purchased. 'Students are offered opportunities to rectify issues with uniform before going to lessons, either by being lent uniform we keep in stock or having uniform brought in from home. 'If they refuse to respond to either of these options then we do have a clear sanctions policy in place.' A school has been accused of acting like 'lunatics' after it sent home 70 pupils for flouting a tough new uniform code - even though suppliers ahd run out of the regulation uniforms. Hardline City of London Academy Islington (COLA-I) in north London, which has about 800 students aged from 11-18, dismissed the pupils last Wednesday morning, on the first day of the new term. The youngsters were ordered to go home with letters detailing how they had breached the strict new guidelines. A number of students were dismissed for not having the required rucksacks emblazoned with the COLA-I emblem. But the academy later relaxed the criteria after finding out the uniform stockists had sold out of the bags. Mr Coogan, of Finsbury, said his 13-year-old daughter Georgina had been sent home. He said: 'They acted like lunatics, sending children onto the streets.' Mr Coogan said Georgina had remained off school as her skirt had still not arrived at the uniform stockists. COLA-I's executive principal Mark Emmerson said the uniform change was the subject of a letter posted to all homes in July as well as a text message to parents on Tuesday last week , the day before term began. 'The vast majority of the children were stopped at the gate, sent home and were back within half an hour. 'I was prepared to sacrifice the first day of teaching as this is part of our strategy to increase and improve standards.'","Lauren Entwistle's mother bought the trousers off a school uniform website .

"There have been calls for an overhaul of maths education in England after it emerged just one in five pupils continue with the subject beyond GCSE level. A study has revealed just one in five students in England go on to study maths after the age of 16, in contrast to countries like Germany and Hong Kong, where more than 90 per cent of pupils continue with the subject. In Singapore, New Zealand and the U.S., over 65 per cent of students persevere with maths. Low numbers: A study has shown that in England the majority of students choose to drop maths after taking the subject at GCSE level . The Nuffield Foundation, which carried out the research, wants to see a new maths qualification introduced in England for those pupils who do not wish to study the subject at AS or A-level. The new qualification should focus on mathematical fluency and statistics according to the study, which looked at maths education in seven countries. It suggests that some students should be given an extra year to prepare for their maths GCSE to ensure they have a good grasp of the subject. And it says that encouraging teenagers to study a wide range of subjects may be a better way to increase take-up of maths than making it compulsory. The report argues that New Zealand and Singapore have high levels of pupils taking advanced maths, which is equivalent to AS-level, but it is not compulsory. Overhaul: The Nuffield Foundation wants to see the introduction of a new maths qualification in England for those students that don't want to study the subject at AS or A-level . Instead, both countries allow students to take a choice of subjects, but require these to cover a range of disciplines. For example, in Singapore a student studying arts and humanities must also choose a maths or science option. The report also found that the evidence from Hong Kong, New Zealand and Singapore indicates that the strongest incentive for students to continue studying maths is because they need to do so for higher education or employment. It also says that universities and employers should ask students planning to study subjects such as teaching and nursing to continue taking maths beyond GCSE. Report author Professor Jeremy Hodgen said: 'Our study shows the importance of a consensual approach to policy development and implementation. 'Higher education and employers will need to be involved in the development of a new qualification if they are to value it and to make it an entry requirement. 'Schools and colleges may need to be incentivised to offer the new qualification to students, as well as to ensure that existing advanced qualifications maintain their levels of participation.'","The number of students continuing to study maths after the age of 16 in England is lower than in many other countries, a new study shows .

"NHS hospitals have resorted to asking zoos and vets to scan patients who are too obese to fit into hospital scanners. The bizarre requests to use CT scanners, normally intended for four-legged animals, at the UK’s leading veterinary college in north London were revealed as hospitals face pressure to adapt beds and wards for an increasingly obese population. The Royal Veterinary College (RVC)yesterday said its CT scanners, customised for horses, could be used to accommodate patients weighing 30 stone or more but they would need to get a special licence to scan humans. CT scanners usually used by zoos and vet for horses could help scan obese human patients . Riaz Dharamshi, a geriatric registrar . at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, West London, said he was told to . refer obese patients to London Zoo when he was training. The practice of referring patients to zoos is commonplace in America where obesity has reached epidemic levels. Writing on his blog, he said ‘Imagine . the humiliation for the patient. ‘I’m sorry sir but you are too fat to . have a CT scan, so we are going to have to send you to the zoo where . they are used to dealing with larger specimens.’' However a spokesperson from the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, which oversees . St Mary's Hospital, said: 'We have never referred or been asked to . refer a patient to London Zoo or the Royal Veterinary College for . scanning.' London Zoo also denied taking obese . patients but a spokeswoman for the Royal Veterinary College confirmed . they have been approached. She said ‘We have been approached on several occasions but have always said we are only licensed to perform scans on animals.’ It is not known whether any veterinary colleges are seeking licenses to perform the procedure. Hospitals face pressure to adapt equipment for Britain's obese population . Dr Dharamshi added ‘Some bright spark decided it would be a good idea to up the loading capacity of the tables we use in the CT scanners, so the problem of having patients too big to scan is not one we face all that often. ‘Wheelchairs are wider, theatre operating tables are stronger and we have access to reinforced hospital beds when we need them. Being overweight has become the norm.’ The CT scanner at the RVC is housed in the equine hospital and is used with a specially built table to support anaesthetised horses. CT scans are used by doctors to assess body fat as well as for more general health checks to see if anything is wrong. Briatin’s fire crews have spent millions on callouts by the NHS in recent years shifting obese patients who have got stuck in the bath or their bedrooms, or who cannot be safely lifted by ambulance staff. A report last year warned the NHS is ‘poorly prepared’ to deal with obese patients, lacking staff and equipment to care for them safely. Bigger trolley, beds and wheelchairs are needed – with more than half of women and almost two thirds of  men likely to be obese by 2050, according to official estimates. The report found incidents involved equipment not being able to take the weight of obese patients, with specially adapted equipment either not being available or normal equipment not working properly when used with obese patients.","Standard sized CT scanners too small for obese .

"Try as they might, President Barack Obama and his administration can no longer get away with attributing their 'scandals' to their predecessors, former Vice President Dick Cheney said Sunday. 'They've been in office a long time now, going on six years,' Cheney pointed out on AM 970. 'They can't . blame George Bush anymore. 'I think he's . been a failure as a president,' Cheney charged. Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, pictured here in Washington, D.C. in May, said Sunday that Obama is a 'failure as a president.' Cheney, left, the former vice president under George W. Bush, center, said that the Obama administration can no longer blame his former boss for all their woes. Bush and Cheney are pictured here with former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert on the House floor during the State of the Union address in 2006 . Cheney, who has returned to his Wyoming roots since serving as vice president under George W. Bush, told the radio station that Washington is 'a mess' these days he's glad he no longer has to live there. 'I think the scandals, with respect to the Veterans Administration, with respect to the IRS, these are bad situations,' he said, according to Business Insider. 'Even worse,' Cheney said, is the current administration's 'absolute gutting' of the military. 'The army is being cut by this administration back to a level that is lower than what we had at the time of Pearl Harbor in 1941.' Cheney, a former Department of Defense Secretary under President H.W. Bush, said he'd learned that the army was about to get rid of 500 majors and it recently laid off a 'large group' of captains. 'They're dramatically cutting back the defense budget, year after year . after year,' he opined. While Cheney said he thinks Obama is out of line for scapegoating his predecessor, the former Bush administration official forewarned Obama that future presidents would be justified in reprobating him over the dilapidation of the U.S. military. 'I think it's a terrible mistake. I think we'll pay a terrible price for . it down the road when his successors are faced with world crises and . we don't have the kind of military that will let us guarantee that we . can get a favorable outcome,' Cheney said of the cuts in audio of the interview provided by Mediate. Noting that it takes years to train members of the nation's armed forces, Cheney argued that a draw down of forces would 'cripple us in future years.' Cheney levied similar criticisms at Obama during a meeting of Republican Party officials on Thursday evening, Time reports. 'We need the world’s strongest military,' Cheney reportedly said. 'It’s as important now as it’s ever been. 'President Obama is making an enormous impact on some President 15 or 20 years from now when he has to respond to some crisis. 'I can guarantee you no future secretary of defense will call Barack Obama and thank him for what he did,' Cheney added. Presumably speaking about the Middle East, Cheney said: 'We are not involved in that part of the world for charity. We are involved for our basic interests.'","Cheney served as George W.

"The Countess of Wessex showed off her sewing skills during a reception for a group of Girl Guides at Buckingham Palace this afternoon. Sophie, who spent the early part of this week in Zambia where she attended the funeral of President Michael Sata, helped put the finishing touches to a charity quilt. A delighted Sophie also got a hug from diabetes ambassador Lucy Upton, who had been given the job of presenting a posy but chose to add a cuddle too. A right royal hug: Girl Guide Lucy Upton snuggles up to a delighted Countess of Wessex . Looking good: Sophie was elegant in a chic black wrap dress and knee-high suede boots . The quilt making party was held in support of the Sensational Sew1 Challenge, a project that aims to raise awareness and find funds for a cure for Type 1 diabetes. Inspired by Juliet Fynn, 16, a member of the 10th Romford Senior Section who was diagnosed with the illness in 2008, Girl Guide groups all over the country have been making patches for the quilt - and have raised more than £1,000 so far. Sophie, who is the president of the Girl Guide Association, added the final stitches to the quilt which will be auctioned off later this month. Miss Fynn, who has since been appointed a youth ambassador for JDRF, the Type 1 diabetes charity, described the project as 'rewarding'.

'I want to do as much as possible to help the Type 1 diabetes charity JDRF in their quest to find a cure for T1 diabetes.' 'Guide groups across the UK should be proud of themselves for choosing to take on the Spectacular Sew1 Challenge,' added Chief Guide Gill Slocombe. 'They have raised awareness and funds for an important charity for young people, the JDRF.

All smiles: Sophie is fresh from a trip to Lusaka where she attended the funeral of President Michael Sata . Work: The Countess of Wessex is the president of the Girl Guide Association in the UK . Type 1 diabetes is the more dangerous strain of the disease and occurs when the pancreas fails to produce any insulin whatsoever. Although usually diagnosed in childhood, symptoms can begin at any age up to 40 and in rare cases, can start at a later age - as in the case of Home Secretary Theresa May. 'Type 1 diabetes is on the rise in the UK and diagnosis can often occur at a young age,' added Karen Addington, Chief Executive of JDRF. 'It’s a challenging condition and requires constant management. So my warmest thanks to Juliet, Girlguiding and everyone who has contributed to the Sew 1 challenge – for raising vital awareness and supporting our mission to cure the condition.' Diabetes: The quilt will be sold to raise funds to support Type 1 diabetes charity JDRF .

"Syrian rebels prepare to unleash their latest improvised weapon in their desperate struggle against the Assad regime - a homemade rocket launcher constructed from salvaged pipe firing projectiles made from domestic gas canisters. The conflict, which has been raging for two years and nine months, has seen fighters from the Free Syria Army deploying increasingly effective locally-made weapons against the far better equipped Government forces. Their latest device, which resembles a mortar, appears to have been bodged together from salvaged piping and metal struts. It fires rockets constructed from domestic gas canisters. Makeshift: Free Syrian Army fighters prepare to fire an improvised rocket launcher against government troops from a position in Old Aleppo . Armed: The men load a rocket constructed from a domestic gas canister into the launcher . A group of rebels were today pictured preparing to fire the device from a position in Old Aleppo, which has been the seen of a prolonged government offensive in recent weeks. Rebel fighters have employed an array of improvised weapons during the conflict including giant catapults firing home-made hand-grenades, armoured cars, and a mortar fired with a PlayStation games console controller. Today Syrian warplanes carried out air strikes near the Lebanese border, wounding at least 10 people who were rushed to hospital in a nearby Lebanese town, Beirut's state-run National News Agency said. The agency said the bombing hit near Arsal, where thousands of Syrians have fled to escape their country's civil war over the past months. Ammunition: A rebel fighter stands next to a cache of locally-made rockets to use against the far better equipped government forces . The state news agency did not say whether the bombing occurred on Lebanese territory. But the area they mentioned, Jroud Arsal, refers to the barren rugged hills east of the town that are within Lebanon. Two Arsal residents said a wounded woman brought to the town after Wednesday's air raid had died. They said three others are in critical condition. The residents spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing for their safety. Arsal is on the other side of Syria's rugged Qalamoun region where the government has been on the offensive for weeks, capturing a number of towns and villages in the area. Military officials were not immediately available for comment. The Lebanese army did not respond to the shelling. On Monday, the Lebanese army fired on Syrian aircraft that violated the country's airspace. It was the first time Lebanon had defended its borders from Syria's military since the uprising broke out nearly three years ago. Improvised: A Syrian rebel uses a home-made slingshot to fire a bomb in the northern city of Aleppo. Opposition forces have turned to making their own weapons to use against troops loyal to the government . Rudimentary: Abu ad-Falhel showed off a row of improvised weapons including a hand-grenade, a portable rocket-launcher, and various rockets with explosive warheads . Unreliable: A rebel adjusts the mortar-launcher. These opposition fighters have even rigged a games console controller to their equipment to fire shells . Syrian forces often chase rebels sneaking in and out of Lebanon. Communities on the Lebanese side of the border dominated by Sunni Muslims have become safe havens for rebels battling the rule of Syrian President Bashar Assad. It is one way that the Syrian conflict has been expanding into Lebanon. The conflict has exacerbated tensions between Lebanon's Sunni and Shiite Muslims, and prompted shadowy groups to conduct attacks that have killed dozens this year. Also Wednesday, state media and activists reported heavy clashes in the Damascus suburb of Adra, part of which was stormed by rebels last month. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said opposition fighters battled with troops from Assad's army as well as pro-government militias known as the National Defense Forces and fighters from Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group. Hezbollah started openly backing Assad's forces in May. Residents in Aleppo inspect a bus that exploded due to what activists said was shelling from forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar Al-Assad . The bus was full of people when it was struck, setting it on fire and killing several people, activists said . The Observatory said a number of government forces were killed as well as two Hezbollah fighters. State TV said 21 rebels were killed in the latest fighting in Adra. Such conflicting death tolls are common. Electricity meanwhile was cut off in the entire northern province of Aleppo due to a ""terrorist"" attack against main power lines, the state news agency SANA said. Syrian state media refer to rebels as terrorists. Attacks on the country's infrastructure have occurred periodically since Syria's crisis began in March 2011. More than 130,000 people have been killed so far in the war, now in its third year, according to the Observatory. The group closely monitors the violence in Syria through a network of activists across the country. The U.N. said in July that 100,000 Syrians have been killed, and has not updated that figure since. Millions of Syrians have been uprooted from their homes because of the fighting .","Improvised device fires projectiles made from domestic gas canisters .

"A young woman who fancied a new look was temporarily blinded and hospitalised for three days following a severe reaction to hair dye she bought in the supermarket. Carmen Rowe's face swelled up 'like a football' after using the Clairol ‘Nice n’ Easy’ natural black colour that she bought at her local Asda. She was admitted to Morriston Hospital in Swansea the following day after the swelling left her unable to see. Yet the 25-year-old said she carried out a skin test 48 hours before using the dye without a problem and had been colouring her hair since she was 13-years-old. Carmen Rowe (pictured right) was admitted to hospital for three days after she had a sudden and severe reaction to Clairol hair dye (left) Miss Rowe was eventually discharged after three days after the swelling was reduced with a combination of steroids and antibiotics. But she was then re-admitted another four times in the following month after developing sores and further swelling. Doctors eventually diagnosed an allergic reaction to the Paraphenylenediamine in the dye. Carmen, of Swansea, said: 'I woke up and my head was so swollen that I couldn’t see. I was blind. 'I looked in the mirror and half of my face was swollen. It looked like half of my head had been pumped up like a football. 'I . went straight to hospital and by the time I got there my head was . swollen everywhere, even my ears were huge. The doctors admitted me . immediately. 'The most . disgusting thing is my head started to leak pus. I had to wrap my head . in a towel, it was horrible and it smelt like a wet dog.' 'My head looked like a football': Carmen needed antibiotics and steroids to reduce the swelling . Carmen Rowe continued to suffer from head and ear weeping after her facial swelling reduced (left). A recent picture (right) shows she still suffers from some puffiness . Carmen bought the non ammonia ‘24 wash’ hair dye from Asda for £3.80. But she lost her job as a packer for a natural health products company because of the amount of time she took off following the incident over Christmas. She said: 'The whole situation was very stressful and made me a bit depressed. Christmas was ruined and I lost my job, all for the sake of a glamorous hair style. 'I know children that have their hair dyed at 13 or 14 and it could be even worse for them. 'I just want to warn parents what could happen. It is an allergy that could develop at any time.' A spokeswoman for Procter & Gamble, which makes Clairol hair dye, said: 'We are sorry to hear about Carmen’s situation. Our consumers’ safety and wellbeing is our absolute priority and we are keen to help Carmen however we can. 'It would appear that Carmen has not been . in contact with our Consumer Relations Department and we would . encourage her to contact them on a freephone number - 0800 169 7669. 'Reactions to hair colourants can occur for a very small number of people, in the same way that some individuals can react to a variety of foods and natural substances. 'Millions of people all over the world use hair colourants without experiencing any adverse effects.  In the UK, around 100 million hair colourant applications are carried out every year in homes and salons. 'Hair colourants are one of the most thoroughly studied consumer products on the market and their safety is supported by a wealth of scientific research.' Allergy: Carmen said she wanted to warn parents of the potential effect of hair dyes. Her reaction left her with a swollen face and sore, reddened neck (left)","Carmen said she performed a patch test 48-hours before with no problems .

"Likely 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has made pointed comments on America's current foreign policy, putting some rare distance between herself and the Obama administration. The 66-year-old - who was Obama's top diplomat during her time as Secretary of State - said she disagreed with the government's embattled approach to international affairs during an extended interview with The Atlantic magazine. The interview was published as President Obama faces major backlash over the way he has handled the current crises in Israel, Ukraine, Syria and Iraq, Fox News reported. 'Great nations need organizing principles,' Clinton told The Atlantic. Keeping her distance: Hillary Clinton, President Barack Obama's first secretary of state, dramatically distanced herself from the President's approach to foreign policy in an interview published Sunday . 'And ''don’t do stupid stuff'' is not an organizing principle.' Clinton specified her main concern was the situation in Syria. She said America should have armed Syrian rebels in the early stages of their uprising against President Bashar al Assad. 'The failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who were the originators of the protests against Assad — there were Islamists, there were secularists, there was everything in the middle — the failure to do that left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled,' she told The Atlantic. Clinton has long advocated that more should have been done in Syria and those opinions in the memoir she wrote of her years in State Department called Hard Choices. Clinton did say that Obama's mantra of 'don't do stupid sh--' was an attempt to assure the American people the government was 'not going to do anything crazy', but that she doesn't think that was the right approach. Under fire: President Obama, who is currently on vacation on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard, has been widely criticised for his approached to halting ISIS advances in Syria . Last week Obama ordered air strikes and humantiarian airdrops in Syri - the first airstrikes in Iraq since 2011. The decision came after a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed his administration had a record-high disapproval rating, with 60 percent of those polled saying they did not approve of Obama's approach. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) called Obama’s response 'clearly very, very ineffective, to say the least', according to The New York Post. 'This is the possibility of a cataclysmic scenario,” McCain told CNN’s State of the Union. He said the radical Islamist group is quickly spreading around the region.","Criticized Obama's 'don't do stupid stuff' mantra for foreign policy .

"CBS has issued an apology after realizing that a man that they interviewed about his actions on the night of the attack in Benghazi  was lying on air. Dylan Davies previously worked as a security contractor hired by the State Department and he told 60 Minutes that he was not on the ground of the Special Consulate when the attack began on the night of September 11, 2012, but he rushed over as soon as he heard. After his interview with reporter Lara Logan aired on the show last Sunday, his account began being questioned publicly and though the initially stood by him- believing his claims that he was the subject of a slander attack by the State Department- they issued a public apology for their mistake on Friday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mea culpa : Logan said on November 8 (pictured) that they were wrong to air her interview with a man called Dylan Davies who lied about his role on the night of the attacks on the American mission to Benghazi . In hiding: Dylan Davies told a story that has now been proved to be false during a 60 Minutes interview and has since received death threats against his family . ‘The most important thing to every person at 60 Minutes is the truth, and today the truth is we made a mistake. That's very disappointing for any journalist, that's very disappointing for me,’ Logan said when she gave an on-air mea culpa during CBS This Morning. ‘Nobody likes to admit that they made a mistake, but if you do, you have to stand up and take responsibility and you have to say that you were wrong and in this case we were wrong.’ During the original interview, Davies- who went by the pseudonym that he used while writing a book about his version of events, Morgan Jones- said that he scaled a 12 foot wall and fought off a terrorist when he arrived at the consulate on the evening of the attack. He also said that he later saw the body of Ambassador Chris Stevens when he went to a local hospital that evening. Now it has been revealed that in . reports he made both to his company, Blue Mountain Group, and the FBI, . he said that he never made it to the compound on the night of the . attack. He said in those reports that he never made it to the Special . Mission compound until the next morning on September 12. Logan . said that they were aware of the discrepancy between the version of . events that he was telling CBS and the Blue Mountain Group report, . saying that before they aired the piece he told them that he lied in the . company’s report to go along with his boss’ story which said that . Davies tried going to the mission but there were roadblocks and he . couldn’t make it. Lies: Davies told 60 Minutes that he scaled a 12-foot wall to get into the compound and then fought a terrorist to the ground once he got inside. He also said he saw the dead body of the American ambassador . ‘His boss is someone he cared about enormously. He cared about his American counterparts in the mission that night, and when his boss told him not to go, he couldn't stay back. So that was always part of the record for us,’ Logan said. She made it clear that what they did . not know was that Davies had given that account to the FBI in their . incident report. His involvement with the FBI report came via The . Washington Post after the 60 Minutes piece aired, and Logan said that . when they confronted him over the claims, he denied it. Logan . said that they have since tried contacting Davies about the situation . and they have not been able to get in touch with him. ‘We . were misled and we were wrong and that's the important thing and that's . what we have to say here: we have to set the record straight and take . responsibility,’ she said. Placing the blame: While she repeatedly said 60 Minutes was taking responsibility, she said that they were 'misled' by Davies who did not tell them that he gave a different version of events to the FBI . Davies . motivation to lie presumably has something to do with the fact that he . is coming out with a book about alleged warnings that he gave the U.S. government about security flaws before the attack. The publisher of the book, The Embassy House, has now said that they have retracted the book. Pulled: The publisher announced on Friday that it will stop selling Davies' book . It had already been on sale online and an unknown number of people had already bought the book. Simon & Schuster announced Friday afternoon that 'in light of information that has been brought to our attention' they will no longer be selling the book. Anyone who purchased the book in the past week since it went on the market can now return it to the publisher, Politico reports. The book itself was another problem for 60 Minutes because while they did disclose that Davies had a book that was being published, they failed to mention that Threshold Editions is an imprint of Simon & Schuster which is owned by CBS. CNN said that they got a statement from Davies who said that his book is 'consistent' with what he told U.S. authorities and the FBI, but their own reporter said that there were discrepancies between his book and official reports. When asked about what steps they took to vet that Davies was telling the truth before they put him on air, Logan said that they did independent research and also used material that he provided. 'We verified that he was who he said he was, that he was working for the State Department at the time, that he was in Benghazi at the Special Mission compound the night of the attack,' she said on CBS' morning news show. 'He gave us access to communications that he had with government officials. we used US government reports and congressional testimony to verify many of the details  of his story and everything checked out. He also showed us photographs that he had taken at the Special Mission compound the following morning.'

"Imagine a diet on which you were permitted to stuff your face with biscuits while still losing weight. Have you imagined it? Right. Well, now you can stop imagining, because there is one eating plan that claims to let you do precisely that. The only catch is that you're only allowed six, specially formulated biscuits per day. So no reaching for the custard creams. And the biscuits are instead of meals. So put down that cutlery. Dr Siegal's Cookie Diet, founded by Miami-based weight-loss expert Dr Sanford Siegal in 1975, is a retro, meal-replacement eating plan of the same ilk as Slim-Fast. And it's coming to Britain. Can you lose weight by eating biscuits? Dr Siegal's diet claims to let you lose weight by eating low-calorie meal-replacement biscuits . The diet involves swapping breakfast, lunch and any snacks in between for just six of the brand's special 90-calorie biscuits - available in flavours including butterscotch, cinnamon oatmeal, chocolate brownie, blueberry, banana and maple syrup - or nine of the little 60-calorie ones. You are permitted to eat a healthy, sensible dinner - just so long as your daily calorific intake does not top 1,200 calories. The cookies - which, according to Madonna, made her then-husband Ritchie lose his sex drive in 2008 - are made from fibrous grains such as oats, fruit and amino acids. A week's supply will set you back upwards of £41.50, and the diet claims to help you drop 10lb per month. Weight loss made easy? The diet claims to enable you to lose 10lb per month . But nutritional therapist Jo Lewin doesn't believe that nutritionally restrictive diets of this nature are the key to long-term weight loss: . Speaking . to MailOnline, Jo said: 'Eating six cookies a day, with only one proper . balanced meal is not seen as a healthy approach to weight loss. 'Restricting calories on a diet like . this is unlikely to lead to long-term weight loss and may result in . nutritional deficiencies. Since when has balanced nutrition been . represented by a biscuit? 'This . looks like another fad diet which is misleading to the public. Restricting the diet and food choices like this is more like to hinder . our health than help it. 'For sustained, healthy weight loss you need adherence and compliance with a pattern of eating that works for you over time. 'You're . better off starting a food diary, watching portion size and cutting out . high sugar snacks than reaching for the cookie jar.' Durable and portable: Dr Siegal says he chose to make his low-calorie food take the form of a biscuit because they are easy to carry and fit in a handbag . Speaking to MailOnline about whether . he believes his diet is a healthy way to lose weight, Dr Siegal said: . 'Decidedly, yes. Any diet that safely takes weight off someone and gets . them to their proper weight is a safe diet, because nothing is more . unhealthy than being overweight. 'People on the Cookie Diet are not . getting the nutrition they need, but that's the purpose. To lose weight . you need to eat fewer calories than your body needs. 'But there's no question they are . getting the vitamins and minerals they need becasue one of the . instructions is to take a multivitamin - and in the US we give free . vitamins with packs of cookies. 'As far as remaining healthy I have . enough evidence of that over the years. I've been treating obesity for . 50 years and using the cookies since 1975. I've treated half a million . patients and we have yet to have the first case of someone not getting . enough vitamins.' Dr Siegal, right, and his son Matthew, CEO of the Cookie Diet, say the diet is healthy and provides clients with all the vitamins and minerals they need . Dr Siegal's son Matthew, CEO of Dr Siegal's Cookie Diet, added: 'As long as you're eating fewer calories than your body needs to maintain it's weight, you will lose eight. 'And as for whether people will regain all the weight they lost when they resume ""normal"" eating.... well, if ""normally"" means their previous eating habits that got them overweight to begin with, then of course they will gain weight. But I'm a big believer in exercise as a means of maintaining goal weight. 'One of the biggest misconceptions when it comes to losing weight quickly is that once come off the diet you will regain the weight immediately. That's just silly. Once you . reach your goal weight the only thing that will determine whether you gain . weight is what you do from that point on. 'The method by which you lose weight has nothing to do with whether you go back to being overweight after. 'The Cookie . Diet takes you to a goal weight quickly and safely, but what you have beyond . that is a lifetime of weight maintenance through healthy eating and . exercise.' Dr Sanford Siegal with a batch of his weight-loss cookies . Writing on his blog, Dr Siegal said: . 'In the early 1970's, after treating overweight patients exclusively for . more than a decade, I came to the conclusion that hunger is the primary . cause of diet failures. 'Through trial and error, I had . determined that 800 calories a day produces the fastest rate of true fat . loss and is quite safe under the supervision of a trained physician. 'Of course, without strong hunger . suppression, an 800 calorie diet would be difficult to follow due to . hunger. I knew that, if I could control their hunger, I could help my . patients faithfully follow the low calorie diet that I favored. 'I decided to try to create a food that was particularly controlling of . hunger while relatively low in calories. After several years of . experimentation in my home kitchen, I developed a blend of particular . amino acids (food proteins) that proved to be quite hunger suppressing . and I baked it into a cookie. 'I . chose a cookie because it's durable; doesn't need refrigeration; fits . in a purse or briefcase; and is enjoyed by nearly everyone.

"When it comes to regrets, the fox in the box has a few – possibly starting with the label given to him by Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. Injuries, expectations, attitude. Three words to sum up why a career that promised so much for Francis Jeffers ultimately disappointed. These days Jeffers’s main claim to fame is to be compared to Wayne Rooney and cited as an example of how two teenage prodigies from the same neck of the woods could take such diverging paths. VIDEO Scroll down for Wayne Rooney makes England senior debut with Francis Jeffers . Francis Jeffers and Wayne Rooney made their England debuts in the same game, against Australia in 2003 . Rooney (left) is now preparing for his 100th cap while Jeffers was most recently playing for Accrington Stanley . The 'fox in the box' scored in the game against Australia at Upton Park, his only goal in his only appearance . England captain Rooney, 28, celebrates his 100th cap against Slovenia on Saturday while Jeffers, 33, is back on Mersyeside learning how to be a coach. They both made their Everton debuts at 16 although Rooney was 38 days younger. They made their England debuts in the same match, a 3-1 defeat by Australia in 2003. Jeffers never played for the seniors again. Yet for a while it looked as if Jeffers was destined to be as big a star as Rooney eventually became. When Wenger paid £8million for him in 2001, he was supposed to be the English bees knees, the final piece of the Arsenal jigsaw. Three years later he was on his way to Charlton for £2.4million. Two FA Cup medals were in the trophy cabinet although injury meant that Jeffers was not part of the final match-day squad on either occasion. Jeffers built up his reputation as a youngster at Everton and signed for Arsenal for £8million . Jeffers praises Arsene Wenger for being honest with him and admits he looks back on his career with regrets . Jeffers scored four goals in 22 Premier League appearances for the Gunners and was sold soon after . During his time at Arsenal, Jeffers was linked to many clubs with wages a stumbling block. These words from David Gold, then co-owner of Birmingham, could almost have been prophetic. He said: ‘If he wants to sit at Arsenal on his big contract and play golf every day, rather than get on with his career, then he can continue with that. ‘Jeffers has got at most 10 years left - and losing something like 150 grand a year is not something I would see as a good career move to be honest. ‘But if the alternative is sitting on your backside doing nothing, where is the motivation in that?’ Good question and one that Jeffers answers honestly. ‘I was out, partying, living life – tossing it off in training because I always thought I wouldn’t play Saturday anyway. Now I look back with a lot of regrets,’ he admitted to the Independent. ‘That is where I should have been putting it in more. Arsène Wenger gave me a fair crack of the whip. I haven’t got a bad word to say about him. He tells you how it is, one of the only managers I played for who did. Jeffers and Rooney make up the Everton bench after the former returned to Merseyside . Rooney, unlike Jeffers, didn't score in the game against Australia but has been a revelation ever since . ‘He said there were things going on in my head that shouldn’t have been and that it was an important time in my career. I am not saying I threw it all away because I had a decent career. I fulfilled a lot of ambition but I always say it, I know how much ability I had. I’m not soft. I know how good a player I was. One England cap wasn’t enough.’ In Jeffers’s defence, his body let him down too. Ankle and shoulder injuries struck on what became a long and winding road from Charlton, to Blackburn, to Sheffield Wednesday, to Newcastle United Jets in Australia, to Motherwell, to Floriana (Malta) and to Acrrington Stanley. There was a loan move to Rangers in there, too, but what should have been a six-month stint was cut short. ‘For some reason, even towards the end when my career was fizzling out, the press have always taken a big interest in me and what I did,’ Jeffers added. ‘I don’t know whether people think the same as I think which is: I should have been better.’ Injuries halted Jeffers' career, who had limited success with Charlton among with many other English sides .","Francis Jeffers and Wayne Rooney played for England vs Australia in 2003 .

"Mario Balotelli showed how pleased he is to be back in the Italy squad after his first call-up from boss Antonio Conte by posting a smiling image with his team-mates, including some of his closest rivals for a place in the team, on Instagram. Former Juventus manager Conte left Balotelli out of the first two squads of his reign and after including him for this international window has made it clear the Liverpool striker's place at training, let alone in games, is far from safe. But Balotelli appears to be singing from the appropriate hymn book in the lead-up to the Azzurri's key Euro 2016 qualifier against Croatia in Milan on Sunday. 'Great guys! Amazing football players,' Mario Balotelli (second left) captions this image with rival Italy strikers Simone Zaza (left), Stephan El Shaarawy (second right)  along with former Milan team-mate Mattia De Sciglio . He posted a shot of himself with fellow strikers Simone Zaza (Sassuolo) and Stephan El Shaarawy (AC Milan), along with Mattia De Sciglio, another former Milan team-mate. 'Friends,' he captioned the image. 'Let's follow them! Great guys! Amazing football players.' The post is a far cry from Balotelli's cheeky jesture at the World Cup when he filled a Panini album with stickers of himself for the amusement of his Facebook followers after his goal in Italy's 2-1 win over England. After not hitting the target in the next two matches which saw Italy bow out in the group stage and Costa Rica and Uruguay progress, there was a backlash of sorts from his senior team-mates. Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli is happy to be in the Italy mix again after his first call-up by Antonio Conte . Daniele De Rossi said: 'We need real men, not Panini stickers or characters. These are of no use to the national team.' Goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon added: 'On the pitch, you see who people really are or are not.' Balotelli became a scapegoat some say after that ill-fated campaign in Brazil, but defender Giorgio Chiellini spoke in support of the talented if inconsistent forward as Italy prepared for Sunday's match and said there was no issue between Balotelli and the squad. Balotelli (centre) is with the Azzurri ahead of Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Croatia . 'There is nothing to mend,' he said. 'The coach has made his choice and there is nothing to add. 'Things went badly in Brazil but we have put a lid on that. 'I understand that it is important for the media to know how many times Mario goes to the bathroom, how often he sneezes and how many times he has called his mother. Balotelli doesn't hold back  (left) and seemingly attempts to trip Ciro Immobile (right) at training in Florence . VIDEO Chiellini denies Balotelli Italy rift . 'But Balotelli is as good as De Rossi, Buffon and the newcomers. What is important is that on Sunday we will be at one.' Conte, who led Juve to three Serie A titles in a row before replacing Cesare Prandelli after the World Cup debacle, has put the ball firmly in Balotelli's court as to whether his stay with the Italy set-up is a short or long term. “If he does as I say, then good, he could be on the team or on the bench or indeed in the grandstand,' Conte said. 'If he doesn’t, well then the doors here at Coverciano (Italian team training centre) are revolving. You can come in and you can go out. We won’t be seeing you anymore and Amen.”","Mario Balotelli is in the Italy squad after first call-up from Antonio Conte .

"It was somehow apt that Eoin Morgan should talk of England’s need for a more aggressive one-day approach at the World Cup on the day Rohit Sharma smashed a world record 264 for India against Sri Lanka. For nothing sums up the magnitude of Alastair Cook’s task in Australia and New Zealand better than the fact that Rohit’s score would have been enough on its own to defeat England in seven of their last 10 one-day internationals. Morgan, one of the few England batsmen who could get somewhere close to Rohit’s heroics if given enough time, attempted to place the feat in context at Lord’s while admitting that different World Cup tactics will be needed. Rohit Sharma - seen here batting against England in August - hit a world record 264 for India on Thursday . Eoin Morgan shows his array of shots against India at Edgbaston in September . ‘I suppose the comparison to that is us bowling a team out for 140 which we have done before in our conditions,’ said Morgan when asked about the small matter of India’s 404 for five in Kolkata. ‘It depends where you are playing. If we were playing in India or at the Oval every game then you might see the odd score like that from us. Remember India are two up in the series with their tails up, too. You never know what’s possible.’ Still, the suspicion remains that England, with their emphasis on the old-fashioned way of keeping wickets in hand for a late burst from the likes of Morgan and Jos Buttler, are still playing a very different game to that seen in Kolkata. Morgan, a key man when England go to Sri Lanka on Sunday for a seven-match one-day series to prepare for their latest attempt to make an impact at the World Cup, agrees up to a point. Morgan - seen here with India captain MS Dhoni - is expected to play a pivotal role at the World Cup . ‘Building a platform can work in England but I’m not sure we can backload it as much in Australia,’ said Morgan, who was below his best for much of last season before finding his innovative touch again in the final Twenty20 international against India. ‘The one-day series there last winter was a huge eye-opener, especially the way the Aussies took us on. We will need to be more explosive throughout the innings, not just at the start, with us all taking more responsibility.’ The role of Cook at the top of England’s one-day order remains an issue. It is perfectly possible for England’s captain to bat through 50-overs for a hundred plus. But is that enough these days and does his strike-rate put pressure on those that follow? ‘Cook is an excellent player and an excellent captain,’ said Morgan. ‘He has been light on runs but then so have I and so has Ian Bell. Cooky can score quickly enough. Every time we have a rain affected one-day match he always seems to find another way to score and he has huge respect in the dressing room. England captain Alastair Cook has come in for criticism for his batting style at the top of the order . ‘He does have another gear. It’s just that, with the amount of Test cricket he’s played, he has honed his game to that and hasn’t had a huge amount of opportunity to develop specific one-day skills. The next four months are key to him being able to do that but he is an unbelievable player and I expect him to score runs and lead us to more one-day series wins.’ It is a view on Cook the one-day player that is made more interesting by the fact that Morgan remains one of Kevin Pietersen’s best friends in the England team and talked sympathetically about the exiled star at Lord’s. The Irishman insisted that Roy Keane’s book rather than Pietersen’s was his reading of choice on holiday - ‘but I’ve heard Kev’s book is excellent,’ he smiled – and denied that his closeness to Pietersen has proved a problem with England. Morgan says he finds it 'terribly sad' that his friend Kevin Pietersen is not in the England team . ‘I don’t feel I was caught in the middle of anything and it hasn’t been awkward for me being a friend of Kev,’ said Morgan. ‘It’s great having played with him and learned from him and I just feel it’s terribly sad that he’s not in the team at the moment being so young and with potentially his best years ahead of him. ‘That’s just the way I feel. I would love to be out here playing cricket with Kevin Pietersen again but the fact of the matter is he’s not involved anymore.’ And in Pietersen’s absence it is Morgan more than most who will have to deliver if England are going to get anywhere near emulating the likes of defending champions India and doing well at the next World Cup. *Investec, the specialist bank and asset manager, is the title sponsor of Test cricket in England.

"Oscar Pistorius will not be allowed to compete in Paralympic sport until 2019 after he was sentenced to a maximum of five years in jail for the manslaughter of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Although Pistorius could be released from prison after 10 to 20 months to go under house arrest for the remainder of his punishment, the International Paralympic Committee told Sportsmail that he will not be welcomed back as soon as that. Craig Spence, spokesman for the IPC, said: ‘It’s five years. 2019 is where we stand on it. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Oscar Pistorius jailed for five years . Oscar Pistorius arriving at Pretoria High Court for sentencing on Tuesday morning in South Africa . Pistorius wins gold in the men's 400m T44 final at the 2012 Paralympics in London . ‘The only way he could compete earlier is if he or his team appealed and got a lesser sentence.’ Pistorius is 27, meaning he will not be free to compete until the age of 32. The IPC had previously indicated that Pistorius could run again despite the manslaughter verdict. But it remains to be seen whether his fitness levels will allow him to start over again in his thirties. His hopes to run at the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Rio are at present dashed. The IPC are standing firm on the five-year sentence, saying 2019 is 'where we stand' on Pistorius competing . The International Olympic Committee were more equivocal about Pistorius being allowed to compete against able-bodied athletes in Rio in 2016 or Tokyo four years later. ‘We take note of the court’s decision,’ said IOC spokesman Mark Adams. ‘This is a human tragedy for the family of Reeva Steenkamp and also for Oscar Pistorius. We hope very much that time will bring comfort to all those concerned but at this stage we have no further comment to make.’ Pistorius’ selection would first need to be ratified by the IAAF – athletics’ world governing body – before reaching the IOC.

"A thug who launched a violent assault on a headmistress when she told off his son for racial abuse walked free from court yesterday. Paul Stratford punched and swore at Zita McCormick after she told him his eight-year-old son Brendan would be excluded for a day. Flanked by colleagues, the teacher told the 31-year-old to calm down. Instead he made for her, punching her and pushing her backward. Aggression: Paul Stratford, left, punched and forcefully shoved Zita McCormick, right,  in front of shocked staff after a showdown over his eight-year-old son Brendan's behaviour . Despite the gravity of the offence, . magistrates decided to impose only a community sentence, telling . Stratford to pay his victim £100. In another astonishing case yesterday, . a Romanian thief who ran a £3million cashpoint scam with 9,000 victims . also escaped jail. Leonid Rotaru was given an 18-month suspended jail sentence. Last night, an education expert said . law and order seemed to have ‘gone out of the window’. Another said . Stratford, who already had a conviction for violence, should have been . jailed to deter others from attacking teachers. The incident took place in June after . Brendan was accused of a racial outburst against a Somali boy at Seven . Fields Primary in Swindon. He also swore at pupils and staff, in . what Mrs McCormick said was his third act of bad behaviour that week at . the 222-pupil school. After calling the boy’s mother to ask . for him to be picked up at 9.30am, his father arrived and launched his . attack in the foyer. A court heard he demanded of Mrs McCormick: ‘Why have you called my son a f****** thug?’ After being asked to calm down, he . repeated: ‘You called my son a f****** thug’ and ordered the teacher not . to wave her finger at his boy. He then launched the attack that was . ended only by the intervention of the caretaker. Mrs McCormick said before the . sentencing: ‘It was very frightening but you work on adrenalin.I could . not let this man get into the school.’ She revealed she has even asked . parents to take anger management classes: ‘They can’t control the anger . they have. The school is where they vent anger at public servants who . are there to protect and educate their children.’ Prosecuted: Stratford claimed he was 'protecting' his son, who was left in tears after Mrs McCormick excluded him from Seven Fields Primary School in Swindon, pictured . Stratford, who was found guilty of . common assault, was given a nine-month community order by Swindon . magistrates. Chairman of the bench David Sinclair told him to pay £400 . in costs and £100 in compensation to his victim. Russell Hobby, general secretary of . the National Association of Head Teachers, said Stratford’s behaviour . was totally unacceptable. ‘Sometimes heads need to make tough . decisions and they need to have society’s full support to make such . decisions for the sake of all their pupils,’ he added. ‘These types of . attacks against public servants doing their jobs should be punished very . severely.’ Chris McGovern, a former headmaster . who chairs the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘This assault happened . in a school and that should make the offence more serious. If schools . aren’t safe then there is no hope. ‘The children first witnessed the . alleged bullying by this boy, then his father supporting him and then . the father hitting the headteacher. It is simply unacceptable. ‘This should have been an exemplary . sentence to ensure that people are put off doing things like this. A . custodial sentence should have been seriously considered. ‘Often you feel that someone who has . committed a crime has not been punished as much as they should have . been. It looks as though law and order has gone out of the window.’ Stratford, who wore a black T-shirt in . the dock yesterday, claimed he was ‘protecting’ his son, who was in . tears after Mrs McCormick excluded him for a day. ‘She was . uncontrollable, she was close to his eye,’ he claimed. ‘I was worried about her pointing him . in the eye and blinding him. And that’s when I thought I needed to do . something to protect my kid.’ Details of Stratford’s son’s allegedly . racist remarks were not revealed to the court, but at a previous . hearing Mrs McCormick, who said she had not been injured in the assault, . described the violent aftermath. She said: ‘Mr Stratford made two huge . steps and actually punched and pushed me and said “Don’t tell my son . off”. The punch came first and then it was a push. It was almost like a . fist and a hand and I came backwards. I said “Don’t hit the . headteacher”. It’s quite shocking and it’s very frightening.’ Pauline . Lambert, prosecuting, said Stratford had not met the headmistress prior . to the attack. After throwing the punch he continued to rant until he . left the building, she said. A recent survey by the NAHT revealed as many as one in ten head teachers has been physically assaulted by a parent or carer. The 1,362 heads surveyed in England, . Wales and Northern Ireland reported being punched, spat on, kicked, head . butted, bitten and sexually assaulted. Twice as many reported being . victimised on social networking websites. One described a ‘serious . kicking attack’ that left its victim ‘badly bruised’ and with . ‘difficulty walking for a couple of days’. In one case a head said a parent had tried to run them over in the car park. Another had a table thrown at them. And one description read: ‘Punched in the face, bitten, kicked, spat at, hand down T-shirt to grab breasts, hair pulled.’ By CHRIS GREENWOOD Crime Reporter . A cashpoint fraudster walked free from court yesterday despite being caught with the private details of 9,000 bank customers. Leonid Rotaru, 32, was captured red-handed by police as he returned to remove a card-reading device from a supermarket cash machine. Officers said the Romanian was a member of an organised gang and already on the run from another force for the same crime. Scam: Leonid Rotaru,  front right was involved in a sophisticated bank card fraud thought to be worth in excess of £3 million and with 9,000 potential victims. He is pictured walking free from court . When they raided his home they found details of 9,000 bank cards, including personal identification numbers (PINs) – on his computer which could have bagged him up to £3.25m. But he escaped a jail term when he admitted four charges of fraud and possessing various illegal devices at Taunton Crown Court. Sentencing him to a suspended 18-month jail term, Judge Graham Hume Jones said: ‘This is a sophisticated scam by which a number of people could have been victims. ‘Even if they had been repaid by the banks, the banks themselves would have been the victims, and ultimately the banks’ customers.’ Criminals use a wide range of tricks . to steal private banking details, including increasingly sophisticated . skimming machines. Last year more than £36m was stolen. In July 2008, Romanian fraudster Adu . Bunu was jailed for five years after he was convicted of cloning more . than 2,000 cards, which allowed him to steal up to £1.1million. In October 2011, another Romanian, . Ion Matei, 34, was jailed for a year after using mousetrap paper to line . ATMs [automated teller machines] so that when customers tried to . withdraw their cash, the notes stuck to the paper and did not emerge . from the slot. Fraud: Leonid Rotaru is pictured returning to remove his skimmer from a cash machine in Somerset . Criminal: The 32-year-old helped to fit 'skimming' devices on cash dispensers, which downloaded the card details of those who used them . In the latest case to come before the . courts, Rotaru – who has lived legally in Britain for three years – . used a sophisticated card-reader, sometimes known as a ‘skimmer’. It . fitted over the slot where customers enter their cards and automatically . recorded information on the magnetic card strip. At the same time a hidden pinhole . camera would record the victim entering their PIN on the keypad. The . crook could then use the information to make duplicate cards. Free: Mr Rotaru was given an 18-month jail term, suspended for two years . The father-of-two was caught out after a  customer at a Tesco store in Minehead,  Somerset, called police after becoming  suspicious. Officers looked at CCTV and saw Rotaru fitting the device and he was arrested as one of them recognised him when, by chance, he returned to collect it. They raided his home in Bridgwater and discovered he had built up a massive hoard of private banking information. They also found evidence Rotaru emailed the details to other members of the gang so they could ‘cash in’. When interviewed, he told police he was ‘at the bottom end’ of the operation, and that the ‘big boys operated out of London’. He refused to identify them. The court heard Rotaru skipped bail while under investigation for another fraud in Axminster, Devon, in 2011. He was eventually convicted by a jury after his DNA was discovered inside the inner  components of the tiny device. Speaking outside court, Barry . Douglas, of Avon and Somerset Police, said Rotaru was part of a well . organised gang. He added: ‘Banks say the average fraud per card is . £460.’ Detective Chief Inspector Paul . Barnard, who leads the police’s cheque and plastic crime unit, told the . Mail in March that 92 per cent of all ATM fraud in Britain is committed . by Romanian nationals. Officers warned there were an estimated 1,000 Romanian cashpoint gangs in Britain, raking in an estimated £30m a year.

"The Vatican has given the go-ahead for a Brazilian surfer to be considered for sainthood. Guido Schaffer drowned in 2009 aged 34 in Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, weeks before he was due to be ordained a Catholic priest. He was known for his work with the poor – in particular native Brazilian tribes. The Holy See has issued a nihil obstat – or ‘no objection’ – declaration for the process of assessing Schaffer’s suitability for sainthood to begin, the Catholic News Agency reported. Guido Schaffer drowned in 2009 aged 34 in Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro . Schaffer died weeks before he was due to be ordained a Catholic priest . Schaffer was nicknamed ‘the Surfing Angel’ and was much loved by his community. Father Roberto Lopes, episcopal vicar for the causes of saints in the archdiocese of Rio said last May: ‘He was very sensitive toward others and was a man of great faith and was passionate for the word of God. ‘On the day of his burial, the Church of Our Lady of Copacabana was filled with bishops, priests and many believers who saw him a young man who was different and deeply loved God.’ The Holy See has issued a nihil obstat – or ‘no objection’ – declaration for the process of assessing Schaffer’s suitability for sainthood to begin . Schaffer was nicknamed ‘the Surfing Angel’ and was much loved by his community . He added that Schaffer ‘inspires more and more young people to follow the way of holiness while continuing to do everything that young people do’. Last month a New Jersey nun credited with curing a boy's eye disease moved a step closer to sainthood Saturday in what church officials said was the first beatification Mass held in the United States. A beatification Mass for Sister Miriam Teresa Demjanovich, who died in 1927, was led by Cardinal Angelo Amato at the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Newark. Beatification is the third in a four-step process toward sainthood. Demjanovich is credited with curing a boy's macular degeneration in the 1960s, the Archdiocese of Newark says. The boy, Michael Mencer, was given a lock of the nun's hair and prayed to her. The effects of the eye disease soon began to fade, Roman Catholic Church officials say. Beatification requires evidence of one miracle that happened after the candidate has died and as a result of a specific plea to the candidate. Sainthood requires a second miracle, though candidates deemed martyrs need only one for canonization.","Guido Schaffer drowned in 2009 aged 34 in Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro .

"Malky Mackay and Paul Jewell emerged as early contenders for the Wigan on Thursday after Uwe Rosler was sacked after 11 months in charge at the DW Stadium. Mackay has been out of work since his acrimonious departure from Cardiff City last December, with Sportsmail later revealing that the Welsh club sent a dossier to the FA accusing him of exchanging ‘racist, sexist and homophobic’ texts and email messages with Crystal Palace sporting director Iain Moody. Mackay withdrew from the running for the managerial vacancy at Palace in August and issued a public apology. Wigan Athletic have sacked Uwe Rosler following a string of poor results at the DW Stadium . Wigan succumbed to a loss at rivals Bolton Wanderers on Friday and sit 22nd in the Championship . Malky Mackay (left) and Swindon Town manager Mark Cooper are early favourites to replace Rosler . Former Ipswich Town boss Paul Jewell is another front runner for the Wigan job . The 42-year-old attended Wigan’s defeat at Brighton earlier this month and it is understood that the club have already made contact with his representatives. Jewell famously led Wigan from League One to the Premier League but resigned in 2007 after keeping them in the top-flight on the final day of the season. The 50-year-old, who has been out of management since leaving Ipswich more than two years ago, held talks with his old club last night over a dramatic return just hours after Rosler was axed. Latics chairman Dave Whelan says he took a long time to come to the decision to sack Rosler . The German took Wigan to the FA Cup semi-finals and the Championship Playoffs last season after succeeding Owen Coyle in December. However, he has won only once in his last 12 games and Friday’s defeat at Bolton saw his side drop to third from bottom in the Championship. Having given Rosler his personal backing last week, it is understood that chairman Dave Whelan sacked him after training yesterday amid concerns that he had lost the support of the dressing-room.

"Daily attack: Christine Blower (above), secretary of the National Union of Teachers, says teachers are being driven out of the profession early because of excessive workload and the fear of Ofsted inspections . Soaring numbers of teachers are taking early retirement amid threats to their pensions, figures revealed yesterday. Almost 9,000 teachers left before the statutory retirement age last year – the highest figure since 1997. Teachers’ leaders blamed the demands of dealing with unruly pupils as well as pressure from targets and Ofsted inspections. They also cited pay freezes and changes requiring teachers to pay more into pension funds. The figures – from the Department for Education – also show more than 230,000 qualified teachers aged under 60 are no longer working in schools. A further 80,700 trained as teachers but never entered the classroom. Vast numbers of teachers are ‘out of service’ even though school rolls will rise after a surge in births. The teachers’ pension age is 65 but those joining prior to 2007 can get their pension at 60. Some 8,880 state school teachers took early retirement in 2010/11 – 1,570 more than the year before. There were only 2,370 early retirements in 1998/99. Most retiring teachers were aged 55 to 59 but a small number were in their early fifties. The average pension for those retiring early was £15,000 a year – excluding lump sums. Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: ‘Excessive workload, a restrictive curriculum and the intense worry and fear regarding Ofsted inspections would certainly lead to many teachers wanting to take early retirement.' Intense worry: The demands of dealing with unruly pupils, pay freezes and higher pension costs were also cited as reasons for the exodus of teachers . She added: 'The teaching profession comes under almost daily attack and criticism from Government and Ofsted. ‘In too many schools, planning and assessment requirements have become formulaic burdens which have become the bane  of teachers’ lives – add to that pay freezes and threats to pensions.’ Teaching unions are battling the Government over pensions, which are becoming less generous due to the squeeze on public finances. The clash has already led to strikes. Chris McGovern, a former head teacher and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘It is a tough job and it’s not surprising teachers are being ground down by teaching disaffected children and relying on a curriculum that is not relevant.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘It’s no surprise that teachers who joined the profession in the 1970s might choose to draw their pensions early – as is their right.’ He said reforms, including giving teachers more freedom to do their jobs, should help attract and retain staff.","Workload, fear of Ofsted and pay freeze cited as factors ."
"Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's unveiling as the new manager of Burton Albion was delayed on Thursday after goalkeeper Dean Lyness suffered a suspected broken leg in the Dutchman's first training session.

Hasselbaink, who replaces Gary Rowett, becomes only the third black manager in the Football League along with Huddersfield’s Chris Powell and Carlisle United boss Keith Curle. ‘I’m delighted to get this opportunity,’ said Hasselbaink, who also played for Leeds, Charlton and Cardiff. ‘My focus is to get success with this club who were really unlucky to not get out of League Two last year. We are going to try to push that on. ‘I’ve been looking. Antwerp offered me a new deal to stay but it wasn’t for me. I wanted to come to England because I have a young family who are still living here. ‘I see myself as a semi-English boy. I came here in 1997. I know how the English think and what they stand for.

You take something from everybody that you like and don’t like. You use it and make it your own, you don’t do exactly the same. I’ve been very fortunate in that aspect. ‘I’ve never played in League Two but there is a lot of talent and passion, and I like that. I’ve seen quite a lot of matches in League Two – Wimbledon and a few others – so I know what I’m getting myself into. ‘We want to put our own stamp on the team, our own philosophy. There will be a few things we want to change but it’s a stable club. ‘I want to give a little bit more entertainment. I’m a winner and that’s what I want to give to my players. ‘Pressure?

"Dr Wright has written a handbook for parents to help them raise teenage daughters . Eating disorders, low self-esteem, body image  and bullying have become a minefield for teenage girls. While parents try to decipher their behaviour and recover from hateful insults, a headmistress has tried to provide help at hand with a guidebook on how to navigate these tricky waters. Filled with basic advice such as 'don't try to be her friend', Dr Helen Wright, former president of the Girls' Schools Association (GSA), tells parents the importance of giving teenage girls the space to grow - but says too much wriggle room is destructive. 'They need time and space to do nothing - to just think and grow,' she says in an interview with the Times. But, she adds, they need boundaries to feel secure, to enable them to take small risks with the knowledge they have some structure in place to protect them. Dr Wright, who spent 20 years teaching . in the UK before becoming a headteacher at an independent girls' school . in Sydney, Australia, has published a book called Decoding Your 21st . Century Daughter: The Anxious Parent's Guide to Raising A Teenage Girl. The mother of two daughters and a son told The Times: 'If you hide your body from [your daughter], you are in effect telling her she should be ashamed of her own. 'Similarly, if you judge people on their appearance in her hearing, you will be showing her that you are judging her critically on her appearance.' This month a study found children as young as 10 are unhappy with their weight and want to shed pounds. Dr Helen Wright says daughters feel pressured into losing weight if their parents worry about how they look . Nearly two-thirds of 14 and 15-year-old . girls (those in Year 10) saying they would like to be slimmer, according . to a report by the Schools Health Education Unit (SHEU). More than a third (37 per cent) of 10 and 11-year-old girls - those in the final year of primary school (Year 6) - say they would like to be slimmer, the survey found. Dr Wright's book is billed as a collection of 'checklists' for what parents needs to know and do to help daughters through issues surrounding friendships, self-image, sexuality, drink and drugs and external pressures. The outspoken teacher has previously accused parents who allow young girls to wear make-up or dress provocatively of now knowing right from wrong. During her time as GSA president she said: 'If parents can't see anything wrong in dressing up their children in ""Future WAG"" T-shirts and letting them wear make-up, high heels and ""mini-me"" sexy clothing, then something is intensely wrong with our society.' She has also previously called for GCSEs to be scrapped and said social networking causes a generation of mean girls. In her book she says sexualised imagery in the media is 'dangerous' for growing girls. She said parents should speak to their daughters about negative portrayals of women. Give your daughter space - but not too much. Children need time and space to do nothing - to think and grow, she says - but adds that while they should be allowed to takes small risks to foster independence, they need boundaries to feel secure. Be a good role model. Don't be judgemental about the appearance of others - she will assume you are doing the same about her. Work on your own self-image if necessary. Encourage a healthy body image. Eating disorders are one of the most common problems to hit teenage girls. Don't fad diet - it will put pressure on your daughter to do the same. Accept your teenager will have mood swings. Their minds are developing and they don't have as much control over their emotions as an adult might. That comes later. Their brains are wired to react quickly and intensively, making for some highly charged emotions. Dr Helen Wright's book Decoding Your 21st Century Daughter: The Anxious Parent's Guide To Raising A Teenage Girl is published by emBooks at £3.99.","Dr Helen Wright has written a guidebook for parents on how to bring up teenage girls .

Over the course of his 22-page lawsuit, Purisima claims that his middle finger was bitten off by a ‘rabies-infected’ dog on a city bus; before a ‘Chinese couple’ took unauthorized photos of him as he was being treated at a local hospital. Also in the rambling and often incoherent lawsuit, Purisima complains that he is routinely overcharged for coffee at LaGuardia Airport. The suit claims the pain and other additional damages he suffered ‘cannot be repaired by money’ and are ‘therefore priceless.’ Included in the suit as evidence is a photo of his bloodied finger. During his ordeal, Purisim claims he suffered civil rights violations, personal injury, discrimination on national origin, retaliation, harassment, fraud, attempted murder, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and conspiracy to defraud.

"A vegan mom was reunited with her son on Wednesday after a judge dismissed claims she was an unfit mother because she wanted to feed her son vegan baby formula. Sarah Markham, from Florida, kissed her son Caleb in court after the judge ruled she could have custody of him provided she meet with a nutritionist. He was taken into care in June when, instead of following a doctor's orders, Ms Markham decided to try supplementing her breast milk with a vegan formula after her son lost 10 per cent of his body weight. Markham's doctor then reported Sarah to Child Protective Services who arrested Markham for child neglect and they took 12-day-old Caleb away and gave him to Sarah's parents. Reunited: Sarah Markham regained custody of her child yesterday after he was taken away because she wanted to supplement her breast milk with a soy formula . Sticks to her beliefs: 'He's still on a soy formula – he's been on it, he likes it, he's doing well. He's growing healthy, and I can't ask for anything more,' Markham said outside the courtroom yesterday . On Wednesday the judge decided that Markham was not an unfit mother and said she could have him back if she promises to meet with a nutritionist. Markham agreed to visit a nutritionist but has said her son is still on a soy formula. 'He's still on a soy formula – he's been on it, he likes it, he's doing well. He's growing healthy, and I can't ask for anything more,' Markham said. “There’s no case, there’s no abuse, there’s no neglect, there’s simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother and he didn’t like it,' Grandfather Bo Markham told WFTV. Caleb now weighs 17 pounds and has been properly taken care of by his grandparents who believe their daughter is a superb mother. Wednesday's case was for the sole purpose of regaining custody but Markham  still faces criminal charges that her lawyer is confident a judge will dismiss as well. 'My hope is that they'll simply dismiss it and not go forward on this at all,' O'Mara said. No abuse: Caleb's grandfather, who has been caring for the boy when Sarah was unable to, has said there is absolutely no child abuse in this case and that his daughter is a fit mother . Faces criminal charges: Mother with regained custody, Sarah Markham, still faces a child neglect criminal charge after caleb was taken away because she tried giving him vegan baby formula . Home again : Caleb, pictured here just days after being born, is now  a healthy 17 pounds and is back in his mother's custody where he still consumes a vegan baby formula . Markham was arrested in June when her son was less than two weeks old. Markham is a Christian Seventh-day Adventist and holistic healing and a vegan diet is in her system of beliefs. Because of her choice not to take her son to the hospital, Markham  was only allowed to see her son during supervised visits and only a few times a week, according to Seminole County Child Protective Services. 'They've kept a child away from a mom,' said attorney Mark O'Mara to WFTV. 'My client can only see her child once a week or twice a week because they're requiring the child be out of the county,' he said prior to Markham regaining custody. O'Mara said that Markham's parenting was 'not even close' to child neglect. 'It's absurd. It's a mom trying to do the best she can, acting as a vegan which she has the entire right to do taking care of her child,' he said. Markham’s son is now healthy and she is happy to have him home. 'She has done everything they've asked her to do: Mental health evaluations, drug evaluations, parenting classes, everything they've asked her to do she's done, and she's done it very well, and yet we have to go to trial on this tomorrow. It's absurd,' said O'Mara yesterday before winning the custody battle. Throw out her case: Sarah Markham's lawyer believes that the criminal charges will be thrown out in the smae way the custody battle was in court on Wednesday . Health problems: Sarah Markham's now healthy baby had lost 10 percent of his body weight and doctors told her to take the baby to the hospital but she tried giving him a vegan baby formula instead . Following her beliefs:  Markham is a Christian Seventh-day Adventist and holistic healing and a vegan diet, even for her child,  is in her system of beliefs .","A judge discarded accusations that Sarah Markham was an unfit mother on Wednesday .

"Using robotics to perform surgery is increasingly common practice - they enable surgeons to perform the most delicate procedures with unprecedented precision . But this 'robotic snake' is a medical droid of a new species, as it slithers down a patient's throat without needing incisions to gain access to certain parts of a body. It is hoped that the flexible device will soon be able to perform advanced procedures inside the human body. Open wide! The Flex System is inserted into the throat to perform operations inside the human body . Known as the Flex System, the design is based on research by Howie Choset, Professor of Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, Pennsylvania. The robot-assisted device is being developed by New England-based company Medrobotics Corp. Originally the robot had been used to explore Austria’s abandoned Zwentendorf nuclear power plant. But now this flexible endoscopic system will be used to give surgeons access to parts of the human body that are difficult to reach via other methods. This will enable more patients to get so-called minimally-invasive treatment, speeding up hospital waiting times. ‘The Flex System is the first robot-assisted flexible endoscopic platform for use during surgical procedures,’ Dr Samuel Straface, president and CEO of Medrobotics, said in a release. ‘The system enables surgeons to access and visualise hard-to-read anatomical locations.' In addition, the robotic snake can 'deploy specially designed flexible surgical instruments to perform procedures.’ The device (pictured) will primarily operate in the oropharynx (the area between your mouth and the top of your throat) and the endolarynx (within the larynx). But in the future it could also be used for more complex operations like heart procedures . Physicians use a joystick to steer the snake around organs and other obstacles after it has entered through the mouth. Attached to the head is a high-definition camera so the physicians can see where it is going. The snake is made of linked segments that enable it to bend while remaining rigid. Each link mimics the position of the one in front, preventing it from accidentally bumping into something as it moves through the body. Either side of the camera are ports for small surgical instruments to be attached. These can be used to operate in confined spaces of the human body. It will primarily operate in the oropharynx (the area between your mouth and the top of your throat) and the endolarynx (within the larynx). But in the future it could also be used for more complex operations like heart procedures. Medrobotics is in the process of marketing the device across Europe, where it could soon be making its way into hospitals. Space scientists are planning to use robotic snakes to explore the hostile surface of Mars. A team from the Sintef Research Institute in Trondheim, Norway, is studying how robosnakes could be . used to gather samples from hard-to-reach places on the red planet. The work is part of a feasibility study by the European Space Agency (Esa) which aims to provide greater mobility during space research than traditional rovers can provide. One . idea is to use a conventional rover, such as Curiosity, to carry a robotic snake over large distances and then deploy it to places the rover . can’t access. Sintef's robot consists of 10 identical joint modules, each having two motorised degrees of freedom. The . modules are covered by passive wheels to give the robot ground . friction, which enables it to slither forward over flat surfaces.","Surgical robot will be used for heart, neck and throat operations .

"Asian American students tend to succeed because their parents invest time researching their education and encouraging their children into traditional jobs and not because of tough rules or habits introduced at home by so-called Tiger Moms, according to a new study's findings. Sociology professors Jennifer Lee and Min Zhou interviewed 82 adult children of Chinese and Vietnamese immigrants from Los Angeles to better understand Asian Americans' success. The professors' discoveries were a departure from the idea of Tiger Mom parenting – strict advice made famous by Amy Chua in a 2011 column where she claimed Asian American children succeed because of parenting rules among the community, including limiting free time, avoiding TV and subjects like gym and drama and ‘insulting’ her children until they reach top grades. The two academics found that though Asian parents aid their children, it comes from their determined research into the best schools and living in a community that prides traditional jobs and academic success above other achievement. No more 'tiger moms': the study's found that socioeconomic factors may be the reason for Asian Americans' success -- as opposed to strict parenting techniques, like the ones made famous by Amy Chua (pictured) This explains why Asian Americans from poor families often succeed just as well as their richer counterparts, whose parents like Chua can invest heavily in extra-curricular activities like encouraging musical instruments and foreign languages. To do this, parents use the 'Chinese Yellow Pages': a whopping 1,500-page directory that lists both Asian businesses in California as well as top high schools and universities. 'Doing well in school' translates to 'getting straight A’s, graduating as valedictorian or salutatorian, getting into one of the top UC (University of California) schools or an Ivy, and pursuing some type of graduate education in order [to] work in one of the ‘four professions’: doctor, lawyer, pharmacist, or engineer,' the researchers say. ‘So exacting is the frame for ""doing well in school"" that our Asian respondents described the value of grades on an Asian scale as ""A is for average, and B is an Asian fail,""' they add. Top marks: Professors Jennifer Lee of University of California-Irvine, left, and Min Zhou, right, from the University of California-Los Angeles conducted the study which casts doubt on 'tiger mom' parenting . It is not down to direct parent coercion but because as a member of the community they have their own measures of success and failure and tend to accord to them. These measures, though, may cause Asian American students to feel alienated when they fail to meet them. Separating ethnicity from achievement, the authors argue, would give Asian Americans space to achieve success on their own terms. 'That Asian Americans are increasingly departing from the success frame, choosing alternate pathways, and achieving success on their own terms, should give Asian immigrant parents and their children confidence that broadening the success frame is not a route to failure,' Lee said in a press release for the study.","Study interviewed 82 adult children of Chinese and Vietnamese immigrants in Los Angeles .
