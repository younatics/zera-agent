"By . David Kent . Spain striker Diego Costa has been given more time to prove his fitness after Vincente Del Bosque delayed naming his 23 man squad for the World Cup. Coach Vincente Del Bosque was expected to trim his provisional 30-man squad for Brazil down to 23 on Sunday, but has instead opted to name 19 players for Friday’s match. The Real and Atletico Madrid players selected in the provisional group earlier this month are omitted after Saturday’s Champions League final, with Del Bosque now going to wait until the June 2 deadline to finalise his squad. 'Until June 2 we do not need to give the final list to FIFA so why do it ahead of time?' he said at a press conference on Sunday.

"By . Mike Dawes . West Coast Eagles midfielder Elliot Yeo is facing a lifetime of trips to the dentist and an estimated £40,000 dental bill after his two front teeth were knocked out in a sickening collision on Saturday. The 20-year-old's front teeth were snapped off in the brutal blow during Saturday's clash against Collingwood at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Footage from the moment Yeo's mouth came into contact with Collingwood ruckman Jarrod Witts' shoulder shows two white objects flying into the air as he is knocked to the ground. Major blow: Elliot Yeo ost two teeth after a collision with Collingwood ruckman Jarrod Witts in the AFL . The funny side: Yeo continued  and tweeted afterwards: 'All I want for Christmas is two front teeth...' Instantly feeling the damage done to his mouth after the impact, Yeo was seen flashing his new look to the referee, revealing his splintered teeth with the roots still intact. The midfielder and ruckman collided after Yeo failed to take an easy mark, the ball slipping through his grasp, right before the half-time siren. It was reported by afl.com.au that trainers were unable to find the teeth. Yeo's teammate Xavier Ellis, told The Age that he was confident Yeo had been wearing his mouthguard right up until the moment of impact. 'I think he had it in for the majority of the night and took it out for 30 seconds to have a breather. I don't think he'll do that again,' Ellis said. 'I think he just took it out for literally 30 seconds and the ball came, so it's a hefty price to pay.' Despite the blow, Yeo shook off the injury and somehow soldiered on. 'It was a big knock … he should have taken the mark,' Eagles coach Adam Simpson told afl.com.au. 'He . kept on going, I don’t know if he was in a hell of a lot of pain or . not, but he didn’t seem to take a backward step after it.'

Yeo played the second half and ended the match with 19 disposals and a goal in the Eagles' eventual eight-point loss to the Magpies. After the game, Yeo tweeted a cheeky reference to the knock: 'All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth...' His teeth are expected to be capped this week as long as there has been no splintering and no nerve damage. Despite the injury, Yeo is expected to be back in action on Sunday for a clash against North Melbourne.","The West Coast midfielder clashed with Collingwood ruckman Jarrod Witts .

"By . Mark Wilson . There is not yet an identikit for the next Celtic manager. Chief executive Peter Lawwell has pledged that the board will both take their time and use open minds when it comes to selecting Neil Lennon's replacement. In the impressive figure of Malky Mackay, however, there is a candidate who might well match many of the criteria that could be considered. Former Celtic player? Check. Young and ambitious? Check. Experience at the top level of the game? Check. Out of work and available? Check. Interest: It is thought that Malky Mackay would be willing to speak to Celtic about their vacancy . It is thought that Mackay would be willing to speak to the Parkhead club about their vacancy. But he also remains a man in demand south of the border. His name is currently being considered in the boardroom at West Bromwich Albion. Tempting him to continue his career in the more constrained Scottish environment may not be entirely straightforward. One man who has worked closely with Mackay throughout his management career to date is adamant, though, that it would be worth every ounce of effort. Scotland midfielder Don Cowie played under the 42-year-old at both Watford and Cardiff and has no doubt Mackay would thrive if handed the reins at Celtic. 'I think Malky ticks a lot of boxes,' Cowie told Sportsmail. 'He is an ex-Celtic player so the fans will be fully aware of him – and he understands the club. 'He is still young in management terms and has done very well in his career so far. 'I'm sure he is desperate to get back in quickly. The Celtic job would probably suit him perfectly. He is available and I can see no reason why he is not the man for it.' Mackay's time at Cardiff came to a controversial end when a breakdown in his relationship with owner Vincent Tan led to a well-trailed sacking last December. Even by the modern standards of the English game, it was a development which led to an outpouring of sympathy for the Glaswegian. He had led Cardiff into the top flight for the first time in 53 years and left them sitting one point above the relegation zone. The Welsh club eventually finished bottom of the Barclays Premier League, six points short of safety. His dismissal did not, therefore, do any significant damage to a reputation that has grown since he took charge of Watford back in 2009. Former Inverness man Cowie was there from the start. 'When I first went to Watford, he was a coach under Brendan Rodgers at the time,' the 31-year-old recalled. 'But I could see he was ready to do more than he was doing. 'Brendan was very much a hands-on manager and took a lot of the training. Malky had to bide his time for a number of months and it took Brendan leaving for Reading for him to get the opportunity to take the Watford job. He grabbed it with both hands. 'Malky is not that long out of the changing room. He knows how players feel and how they want to be treated. 'You know that you can have a laugh with him but, at the same time, you are very aware you don't want to cross the line. His door is always open if you want to have a chat. But he will soon let you know if your standards have dropped or if he thinks you are not putting the effort in. Interest: Don Cowie is currently weighing up the offer of a new contract at Cardiff . 'He did very well at Watford with a not very big budget at all. He then got the move to Cardiff and a team that had fallen short at the last hurdle on a number of occasions. 'Malky was the man picked to get them into the Premier League and that's exactly what he did in his second year. 'He had done it a few times as a player and knew exactly what it took to get over the line. His first year was about transition and building the squad. But we managed to get the job done in the second year and that was a great achievement.' Mackay's profile rose in accordance with Cardiff's success, yet the spotlight he would face at Celtic would be of substantially greater wattage. The environment in Glasgow can be stifling for those in the lead roles. It is a situation that requires a certain type of character. Again, though, Cowie believes Mackay has what it takes. 'I know being a manager of the one of the Old Firm clubs isn't easy,' he recognised. 'It's not just back page stuff, you are on the front page as well. 'There is huge scrutiny on you and the passion from the fans is incredible. You are in the public eye all the time. 'But I think Malky has shown he can handle that kind of situation. It's not something that's great to talk about but the scenario at Cardiff with the owner wasn't ideal. 'But Malky conducted himself in a certain manner and was still willing to put himself out to the media. On the dressing room side, I could see how well he was handling it. He didn't allow the players to get caught up in it or for it to be used as any kind of excuse. 'He keeps all external stuff away from his players and I'm fairly confident he could handle anything that is thrown at him should he end up at Celtic.' Cowie is currently weighing up the offer of a new contract at Cardiff amid reported interest from Blackburn Rovers. Wherever he ends up next, he will never forget the influence Mackay has had on him. 'My Watford contract was out at the same time as he took the Cardiff job,' Cowie said. 'He asked me to come and join him again and I was confident Malky was the person who could get that club promotion. 'We did just that and I managed to play in the Premiership. I also added ten Scotland caps while working under him. So he has been a great help to my career and I will always be in debt to him.'","Mackay believed to be interested in speaking to the Parkhead club about their vacancy .

"By . Mike Dickson In Paris . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . Despite being someone who has won the championship eight times, Rafael Nadal has never enjoyed an unconditional love affair with the French Open or the Roland Garros public. On Monday, returning yet again to begin the defence of his title, he will find himself taking his bow on the secondary Court Suzanne Lenglen, with Novak Djokovic and Australian Open champion Stanislaw Wawrinka playing their matches on the main Court Philippe Chatrier. The indications last night were that the Nadal camp were none too impressed with the undisputed king of clay being treated in such a manner. Back to his best? Rafa Nadal, watched by uncle Toni, practices at Roland Garros before his title defence . Unloved: While Nadal attracts the admiration of the French crowd he has never been completely accepted . His public relations manager Benito Perez Barbadillo gave an obvious clue to how the world number one was thinking when he tweeted: '3rd in Suzanne Lenglen tomorrow. What do you think?' While there is no unshakeable convention here as at Wimbledon that a returning men’s champion gets to kick off at an appointed hour on the equivalent of Centre Court, and it is not the end of the tennis world, some irritation is understandable. It is not that Djokovic or Wawrinka have especially juicy opponents – although the latter needs to watch out against Guillermo Garcia Lopez – and women’s champion Serena Williams was put on Chatrier on Sunday. Nadal will have to wait his turn to tackle American Robby Ginepri and it will add to the sense that not everyone would be unhappy if someone else won this year. All sport needs unpredictability and through his sustained brilliance on clay the Spaniard has sometimes turned this into a procession. For that reason the Parisian crowd could hardly hide their delight in 2009 when he lost at this event to Robin Soderling, having been booed off court when he retired injured in late 2008 at the indoor Paris Masters that happens each November. His uncle and coach Toni Nadal did not attempt to conceal his fury five years ago, calling them ‘stupid’, among other things. The way of tennis crowds is often only to love a player when they are on the downslide. Today’s scheduling may add to the determination of his nephew to prove the doubters wrong over the next fortnight as, for the first time since the middle of the last decade, he comes here as many people’s second favourite. Made to wait: The defending champion will not being his campaign until after late on Monday . Strong: Federer breezed through his first round match against Lukas Lacko and says Nadal is still the man to beat . The world number one has lost three times on clay this year and looked well beaten in the recent Madrid final before Kei Nishikori succumbed to a back injury. He has talked of losing some of his ‘inside power’ and theories have abounded about the relative slippage in his results. Some believe it to be a minor loss of confidence while in a recent interview with the New York Times, former Spanish Davis Cup Captain Emilio Sanchez suggested his footwork on the backhand may have marginally changed to protect his left knee. It was hard to agree with Roger Federer – a comfortable opening day winner over Luckas Lacko in straight sets – that Nadal is ‘probably where he wants to be’ after losing to Djokovic in the Italian Open final. Betting against Nadal in this event may well be foolhardy, although the bookies now make the Serb the marginal favourite for the title. Federer became unusually tetchy when asked if he considered the Spaniard was less fancied than Djokovic. Favourite: Novak Djokovic goes into the tournament as favourite after beating Nadal in Rome last week . 'I don’t know who is saying it, I definitely didn’t. It doesn’t go week to week, you know. Three weeks ago Novak couldn’t play tennis anymore (a reference to his brief wrist injury). When he was injured it was ‘Everything is terrible, oh my God’, now everything is great. 'Rafa has played the matches he needs to play. He is the favourite, then Novak and then the rest. It’s very clear.' Few are rating Andy Murray’s chances especially highly, and he will have to wait until Tuesday to play his first round, against Kazakhstan’s Andrey Golubev. Heather Watson also plays then. Of the three British players in the singles qualifier James Ward joins the fray on Monday lunchtime after being slotted into the draw against the number seventeen seed Tommy Robredo. It is not much of a reward for coming through the qualifying, neither a glamour tie nor against an especially vulnerable opponent. Robredo is a hugely tough and consistent competitor who rarely loses to players ranked much below him, and it will require a career-best performance from world number 170 Ward to topple him. But the British number three is in good form and has nothing to lose, playing with house money .","Defending champion will not start on Court Philippe Chatrier .

"By . Lizzie Parry . and Sophie Borland . GPs will today debate whether to charge patients up to £25 for appointments. The idea will be put to delegates at the British Medical Association conference in York, inspired by a need to deter patients from missing their appointments - a problem that costs the NHS £160million a year. If passed, the BMA would then have to decide whether to ask the Department of Health to impose a national charging system. The potential fees - which would be the first since the NHS was founded in 1948 - could be used to plug the critical shortage in GP funding. GPs will today be asked to vote on plans to charge patients for their appointments. It comes amid fears from senior medics that the proposals will harm the nation's health and disadvantage the most vulnerable in society. (File picture) But in a letter to The Telegraph, leading medics have warned the plans threaten to hit the poorest and most vulnerable in society and have a detrimental affect on the nation's health. Clare Gerada, past chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners and Dr Clive Peedell, joint leader of the National Health Action Party, have signed the letter, along with 539 doctors and medical students. It called on BMA delegates to reject the plans, which could involve charges of between £10 and £25. The letter said: 'User fees are a disincentive to accessing health care, and target the poorest disproportionately. 'They lead to worsening care for chronic conditions, and to more people seeking treatment at A&E.' 'The poorest and sickest in society must not foot the bill for the lack of political commitment to sustainable funding for GP services.' One GP told the Daily Mail they lost an entire morning's work when 14 patients failed to turn up. Others believe the free care offered by the Health Service is unsustainable in the face of an aging and increasingly obese population. It is feared however that charging would stop patients seeking help or encourage them to go to overstretched casualty units. Under the proposals it is likely the elderly, children, pregnant women and others will be exempt or charged less. Patients could be charged when they book an appointment – an incentive to turn up. But there are fears that charging would stop patients seeking help or encourage them to go to overstretched casualty units . The . GP practice would pocket the money – as happens with charges for . writing letters or signing forms – to be reinvested into services. In France patients pay a flat rate of 23 euros (£19) to see a GP and most are reimbursed by insurers, leaving them with a bill of about six euros (£5). But campaigners and many family doctors – including the leaders of the BMA – oppose the idea in Britain. Dr Mike Smith, who chairs the Patients Association, said: 'A move to charge for routine appointments will have a devastating impact on many vulnerable patients. 'This will put pressure on already stretched A&E services as people would be reluctant to pay to visit their GP and will present themselves at the emergency services. 'There are many people today who cannot afford to pay for every GP appointment. 'This practice can be seen as nothing less than profiteering from the most vulnerable as they attempt to access healthcare which is theirs by right.' Opponent: Doctor Chaand Nagpaul, the chairman of the British Medical Association's GP committee and a family GP in north-west London . Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GP committee and a family doctor in North West London, said: 'The BMA policy still is that we do not support charging patients because it is against the NHS's care being provided at the point of delivery. 'Anyone who is ill should not have to consider cost as a barrier to seeing their GP.' But Alex Wild, of the TaxPayers' Alliance campaign group, said: 'Missed and unnecessary GP appointments cost taxpayers a fortune so it's no wonder that charges are being considered. 'But until GPs drastically improve the service they provide by working out of office hours and reintroducing more responsive appointments, they should not be asking hard-pressed families to cough up even more cash for a substandard system. 'Primary care must be run for patients, not for doctors.' Dr Nigel Watson, chief executive of the Wessex local medical committee, which is proposing the motion, said: 'Personally I feel that services should be free at the point of access. 'The problem we have at the moment is that the resources that are available don't meet the demand. This is about having a debate about how we move things forward. 'General practice is still seen around the world as one of the strengths of the NHS. To continue this and to build on out-of-hospital care we need more resources. 'If that can't be obtained by taxation it's going to have to come either from closing hospitals down – which is incredibly difficult – or resources need to come from elsewhere. 'Many of us wouldn't want it to come from charging patients but that's why we need a debate.' The motion – uncovered by Pulse magazine – calls on the BMA to 'explore national charging for general practice services with the UK governments'. GPs will also vote on whether to defy the Government's plans for them to keep surgeries open from 8am to 8pm to make it easier for patients to get appointments.","GPs at the BMA conference in York will vote on plans today .

"By . Darren Boyle . Pregnant woman who eat junk food or consume sugary drinks prior to getting pregnant are 50 per cent more likely to have a premature baby, an Australian scientific study has found (picture posed by model) Mothers-to-be who eat junk food and sugary snacks are more likely to have premature babies, according to a new report. University research has for the first time confirmed that women who eat a poor diet before they become pregnant are around 50 per cent more likely to have a preterm birth than those on a healthy diet. Researchers at the University of Adelaide's Robinson Research Institute investigated the dietary patterns of more than 300 South Australian women to better understand their eating habits before pregnancy. It is the first study of its kind to assess women's diet prior to conception and its association with outcomes at birth. The results, published in The Journal of Nutrition, show that women who consistently ate a diet high in protein and fruit prior to becoming pregnant were less likely to have a preterm birth, while those who consistently ate high fat and sugar foods and takeaway were about 50 per cent more likely to have a preterm birth. Dr Jessica Grieger, post doctoral Research Fellow with the Robinson Research Institute said: 'Preterm birth is a leading cause of infant disease and death and occurs in approximately one in 10 pregnancies globally. Anything we can do to better understand the conditions that lead to preterm birth will be important in helping to improve survival and long-term health outcomes for children.' 'In our study, women who ate protein-rich foods including lean meats, fish and chicken, as well as fruit, whole grains and vegetables, had significantly lower risk of preterm birth.' A healthy diet increased the chance of a baby being born full-term while kebabs and sugary drinks made problems more likely . Dr Geiger said: 'On the other hand, women who consumed mainly discretionary foods, such as takeaway, potato chips, cakes, biscuits, and other foods high in saturated fat and sugar were more likely to have babies born preterm.' 'It is important to consume a healthy diet before as well as during pregnancy to support the best outcomes for the mum and baby.' She added: 'Diet is an important risk factor that can be modified. It is never too late to make a positive change. We hope our work will help promote a healthy diet before and during pregnancy. This will help to reduce the number of neonatal deaths and improve the overall health of children.'","Australian researchers find link between junk-food and pre-term babies .

"By . Eve Mcgowan . It is a gadget that athletes including boxer David Haye swear by in helping them to recover from injury. But now hilotherapy – a device that pumps cool water in to variously shaped cuffs – is proving to be an effective way to ease the pain of arthritis. The machine offers a hope of respite for millions of patients currently relying on strong painkillers to cope with the condition. Wash away the pain: Hilotherapy pumps pumps cool water in to cuffs to ease pain and has now been found to help with arthritis . Iced compresses have long been used to reduce inflammation and promote healing in arthritic or injured joints, but the unique selling point of a hilotherapy machine is that it keeps water at a controlled and consistently  cool temperature for hours. Studies have shown that such extended use can potentially allow a rapid reduction in the inflammation that causes pain for arthritis sufferers, and may speed up healing after an  injury or surgery. Facial surgeons already use the device, manufactured by German company Hilotherm, to reduce post-operative swelling. Retired travel agent Jenny Bakewell, from Stratford-upon-Avon, found the hilotherapy machine worked wonders on her arthritic right knee joint, which had swelled up to more than double its normal size. Hitting back: David Haye swears by hilotherapy when he recovers from injury . ‘Before using the machine I couldn’t get up and down the stairs and could barely walk. Even getting in and out of the car was difficult. It was a nagging pain that was always there,’ says the 78-year-old. She used the device for three hours a day over four weeks and saw the swelling subside and her knee return to its normal size. She was also able to stop using the strong painkillers she had been relying on. ‘I couldn’t believe the results,’ she says. ‘Both my knees look the same size now. I don’t use the machine regularly any longer – I just don’t need to. Now I only use it from time to time when I see the knee is getting puffy again. ‘It doesn’t get rid of the arthritis – nothing can do that – but it makes life more bearable.’ Dr Tom Margham, of Arthritis Research UK, says: ‘Any treatment for arthritis which allows people to take fewer painkillers is a good thing. Making the nerve endings very cold means they don’t transmit the pain messages as well. ‘I’ve seen the idea of a temperature controlled fluid machine before used for acute sports injuries but I’ve never heard of it being used for arthritis.’ As Dr Margham points out, the use of ice and/or heat around a sore joint has long been accepted. ‘Both are recommended as a form of pain relief for osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritis,’ he says. ‘We particularly recommend applying ice when you  have a flare-up. Frozen peas or gel packs in the freezer or fridge would work too. We recommend putting them  on the joint affected for at least ten minutes.’ However, the use of ice packs or similar home-made solutions could damage skin in the long term as extreme cold can burn in the same way as extreme heat. ‘What’s really new about this machine is the fact that you can control the temperature at the level you want and it’s easier to wear for a longer time because of this,’ says physiotherapist Sammy Margo. He points out that a patient’s tolerance of extreme cold can vary widely. ‘The physiology behind the hilotherapy machine makes so much sense. ‘A mixture of ice and compression will help deal with inflammation and reduce swelling. The cold will have an effect on the pain receptors. ‘It’s essentially  an automated version  of what physio-therapists have been carrying out for  many years.’ Available currently only at private clinics, hilotherapy treatment costs from around £40 per hour-long session. However, the machines are available to hire at home for £50 a week or to buy outright for around £1,850. hilotherapy.com .","Hilotherapy pumps pumps cool water in to cuffs to ease pain .

AlaxoStent is also suitable for sufferers of obstructive sleep apnoea, a more extreme manifestation of the problem in which breathing stops for short periods. At night, the soft tissues of the back of the mouth, nose and throat relax and may narrow. Snoring is caused by these tissues vibrating during breathing. It is estimated that a third of men and almost one in ten women are regular snorers. The noises can also be a sign of obstructive sleep apnoea or OSA, which is estimated to affect around four per cent of middle-aged men and women. In OSA the airways close completely, blocking the flow of air into the lungs during sleep for more than ten seconds and up to more than two minutes at a time. Left untreated, OSA can increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Risk factors for snoring and for OSA include being overweight, alcohol use, being over 40, having a large neck, using some medications including sleeping pills, smoking, and being menopausal, where hormonal changes can lead to throat muscles relaxing. OSA is also three times more common in those with diabetes, and twice as likely in those who suffer with chronic nasal congestion. Treatments range from lifestyle changes, such as losing weight and stopping smoking, to soft tissue implants and surgery. Continuous positive airway pressure or CPAP, which involves using a device to assist with breathing during sleep, is considered one of the most effective therapies for moderate to severe OSA. It involves wearing a mask over the nose to deliver a continuous supply of compressed air during sleep to prevent the airway from closing. Common issue:  It is estimated that a third of men and almost one in ten women are regular snorers . Although effective, it has been estimated that between 25 and 50 per cent of patients are unable to use them long term. Some find the mask difficult to get used to, while some have problems with the noise of the CPAP pump. Unlike CPAP, the AlaxoStent does not require a pump or electrical supply, and the wearer can move around with it in place. The device consists of a 160mm piece of braid or mesh made from nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium that springs back into  shape after being handled. The braid comes in a long, 4mm-wide flexible tube which the patient inserts into a nostril and pushes through the nasal cavity and into the throat while lying down. After the tube is pushed into the airway, the user retracts it, leaving just the mesh in place. Once out of the tube, the mesh returns to its pre-formed size and shape, and the end in the throat expands like a tulip flower to become 17mm wide, thus preventing the surrounding soft tissue from collapsing. The end of the braid protruding from the nose is taped to the cheek of the user, and in the morning, the patient simply pulls the mesh out of the nose. The developers say the challenge of insertion is no greater than that of putting a contact lens into the eye. A study at the ENT University Hospital of Erlangen, Germany, also found that the new method worked as well as CPAP therapy. If nasal congestion is the reason for problem breathing, another shorter device – the AlaxoLito Nasal Stent – is designed to keep open the nasal airways alone. It has also been shown that it increases air flow by 47 per cent in healthy volunteers, raising the possibility of other uses. Testing of the  technology during jogging, cross-country skiing and mountain  hiking suggests that it  could improve  breathing through the nose and sports performance. According to researchers,  breathing through the nose increases the blood oxygen content by 10 to 15 per cent compared with breathing through the mouth. Both devices are approved for use with patients in the European Union, Canada and India. Bhik Kotecha, a snoring specialist and a consultant ENT surgeon at the Royal National Throat, Nose & Ear Hospital in London and at Queen’s Hospital in Romford, Essex, has used the device on some of the first British patients. ‘It is approved for use in  the UK and we now have  the results from a study involving our first ten cases,’ he says. ‘We found it was very effective for some patients, especially those whose snoring involves vibration of the soft palate. It is less suitable for patients where snoring is due to the collapse of the tongue base or for very severe OSA. ‘This device is a useful addition because while CPAP is the gold-standard treatment, compliance is variable, and the results from surgery are not always predictable, so that any benefits are not necessarily sustained.’ Chris Challis, a 40-year old software engineer, who lives with his wife Steph in Cambridge, was one of the first people to have the stent in the UK. ‘Having tried mouthguards and being prescribed CPAP, I found that the stent is the best, quietest and most comfortable of all the options available,’ he says. ‘CPAP was very noisy and was worse to live with than the snoring, according to my wife, plus it is not portable. I enjoy camping and going to festivals but I couldn’t take CPAP with me to them. ‘It was also very uncomfortable and my wife hated it. The mouthguards I’ve tried all tend to fall out during the night or move enough to cease being effective by the early hours of the morning, which is when Steph would most likely wake up. ‘Initially it was a tough learning curve – inserting something through your nostril every night is not the most pleasant of experiences – but it is worth it. I can now insert it without a mirror. ‘The stent has provided both of us with more undisturbed nights of sleep than all the other methods combined.’ There are several surgical techniques to correct snoring, although these are not usually available on the NHS. However, these are only effective on a specific cause of snoring – when the problem lies with the soft tissues at the back of the mouth. One option is for surgeons to use a blade or laser to trim away the uvula – the piece of tissue that hangs from the roof of the mouth. The laser option is thought to  be less risky in terms of bleeding and post-operative infection, although there is evidence that it is less effective.","The new titanium implant is inserted into the nose overnight .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A 39-year-old Fresno woman's dream to have a baby came true on Thursday, only she wasn't awake to celebrate the joyous moment. Melissa Carleton is in her tenth week in a coma and gave birth via c-section to a healthy baby boy as her family waited anxiously to hold the little one. Doctors say the family therapist was left 'unable to fully wake up' following a seizure brought on by a benign tumor, but hope she'll soon join her husband in cuddling with their newborn son. Proud dad: Brian Lande holds his newborn baby son after his wife gave birth via c-section while in a coma . Bittersweet: Brian Lande (right) says his wife Melissa Carleton (left) always yearned to have a baby. On Thursday, she got that wish but wasn't awake to experience the joy with her family . Bundle of joy: Carleton gave birth to a baby boy she carried to full term on Thursday via c-section after falling into a coma ten weeks ago . 'I know that being able to love this little guy is going to be a wonderful experience, but I also know it's going to be very hard for me to know that I am going to be the one to hold this baby first,' Carleton's husband Brian Lande told KFSN-TV. Lande described the heartbreaking reasons that his son's birth was like both a dream and a nightmare for his comatose life. 'She was also terrified that she would miss the baby and something would happen to her and she wouldn't get to meet our son and she wouldn't get to participate in being a mother,' Lande said. Carleton's father John Farrell had an easier time looking to the bright side of things as he welcomed his grandson to the world. 'She’s wanted to have a child for years,' he told ABC News. 'Today, I can’t begin to tell you how happy we are. It’s indescribable.' Just before the surgery that brought the bundle of joy to the world, Farrell told ABC of a achingly beautiful moment when his daughter--who can open her eyes and squeeze her loved ones' hands--showed more signs of life than she had at any time throughout her two and a half months on unconsciousness. 'In a few tender moments, she reached out to Brian, took his cheek, pulled his cheek down to her face and held it there,' Farrell said. 'It was the first time she had hugged Brian since this trauma happened.' Carleton first learned of her tumor during a visit to the emergency room over terrible headaches. The expectant mom originally planned to wait until after she gave birth for surgery to remove the tumor, but her health quickly deterioted to the point where she was unable to walk short distances with needing to sit down and rest. Not ideal: Lande professed his sadness over having to be the first to hold the baby instead of his wife . 'She was also terrified that she would miss the baby and something would happen to her and she wouldn't get to meet our son and she wouldn't get to participate in being a mother,' Lande said. New addition: The little boy is doing great and his mother will be transferred to a rehab facility once she recovers from the surgery . Waiting game: 'I know that being able to love this little guy is going to be a wonderful experience, but I also know it's going to be very hard for me to know that I am going to be the one to hold this baby first,' said Lande . The expectant mom originally planned to wait until after she gave birth for surgery to remove the tumor, but her health quickly deterioted to the point where she was unable to walk short distances with needing to sit down and rest. In March, she suffered a seizure and was rushed in for emergency surgery. She has not woken up since, though KFSN reports that the surgery went fine and that the seizure is to blame for the coma. Doctors plan to transfer Carleton to a rehab facility once she recovers from her c-section, where they hope she'll wake up from her coma. Meanwhile, Lande has created a GoFundMe page to help raise money to cover his wife's mounting medical expenses. As of Thursday evening, it had raised close to $80,000 of a $100,000 goal. Carleton first learned she had a brain tumor in her second trimester and at first decided to wait it out and have it removed after giving birth . After Carleton had a seizure she was forced to undergo emergency surgery and as been unconscious ever since .","Melissa Carleton suffered a seizure due to a benign brain tumor that left her 'unable to fully wake up'

"By . Lizzie Parry . Marion Beaton, now 105, was forced to wait more than two hours for an ambulance after falling and injuring her arm at home . An injured 105-year-old woman was forced to wait in agony for more than two hours after eight ambulances were diverted to other emergencies. Marion Beaton fell at her home in Hebburn, South Tyneside, in the middle of the night. But it was not until her carer came in just before 8am the next day that the centenarian was discovered slumped in her hallway. The carer dialled 999 immediately, but was forced to wait more than two-and-a-half hours until paramedics arrived at 10.32am. Ambulance bosses have apologised to Mrs Beaton, but her neighbour George Ludford today criticised the delay in reaching one of the region's oldest residents, branding it 'disgusting'. The pensioner is recovering at South Tyneside District Hospital after injuring her arm when she fell on May 16. A spokesman for North East Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: 'It’s not acceptable that a 105-year-old lady had to wait this long, and we are sorry that we could not get there earlier than we did. 'We were called at 7.57am on May 16 to reports that the lady had fallen. 'She was with a carer. The lady suffered an arm injury, but was breathing and conscious. 'As the patient was deaf, the triaging process took a bit longer than usual. 'However, it was established that the lady was not in a life-threatening situation, and was classified as a Green 3. 'Between 7.57am and 10.32am, eight different crews were allocated to call - but all were diverted to 'red’ incidents, due to heavy demand. 'During the wait for a vehicle to become free, we kept in touch with the patient. 'Up until 9.44am there had been no change in her condition. 'However, due to the length of time waiting, the call was then upgraded to a Green 2. 'Having dealt with the life-threatening situations, our crew arrived at the scene at 10.32am, and took the lady to South Tyneside A&E for treatment to the arm injury.' Neighbour George Ludford has branded the delay 'diisgusting'. The North East Ambulance Service NHS Trust has apologised for the delay, explaining the eight ambulance crews were diverted to 'red' 999 calls - the most serious, where patients' lives were in danger .","Marion Beaton fell in the night at her South Tyneside home on May 16 .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A fit and healthy PE teacher lives under the dark cloud of her skin cancer returning, having suffered four bouts of the disease - despite never using a sunbed. Becky Giddins' melanoma relapsed three times since she was first diagnosed in April 2007. The 32-year-old suffered her fourth relapse in January, just a week after returning from her honeymoon. As the cancer spread Mrs Giddins had to have a lumpectomy, a third of her left lungs and her lymph glands removed. Becky Giddins has survived four bouts of skin cancer, despite using sunbeds. Today the 32-year-old is raising money and awareness to help others fighting the disease. She was first diagnosed with melanoma when in April 2007 . Since being diagnosed Mrs Giddins, 32, has had a lumpectomy, half of her left lung and her lymph glands removed . Reliving her diagnosis, she said: 'When they told me it was cancer I didn’t know how to react - I was on my own and it really didn’t sink in. 'It only hit me when the doctors told me the mole was cancerous and it had be removed. 'I was completely shocked, but relieved that they had removed it. 'I have never been on a sunbed in my life - not even to build up a base tan before going on holiday. 'As part of my job and coaching I’m outside a lot but, because I’m naturally fairly skinned, I’ve always worn sunscreen.' The skin cancer was first discovered after a weird mole on Mrs Giddins’ calf changed colour and became scabby. On visiting the doctor, a biopsy confirmed the growth was cancerous which meant the mole was removed along with a surrounding 2cm of skin. Following the operation, the teacher from Kidderminster in the West Midlands, lived cancer free for almost five years. As the cancer spread Mrs Giddins had to have a lumpectomy, a third of her left lungs and her lymph glands removed . In that time she met her future husband, Kevin. Over Christmas in 2011 - one week before her final CT scan to check whether she was in remission - Mrs Giddins found a lump in her groin. After a biopsy showed the melanoma had returned and spread to her lymph nodes, both were removed in February 2012 and a drain was fitted in her leg to remove lymph fluid. Mrs Giddins said: 'The second time round I kept scaring myself looking things up on the internet and making myself quite upset. 'Having the drain attached was horrible - I was permanently carrying this bag round me which was collection the fluid. 'I refused to let it get me down though, so when me and the girls went out for my 30th birthday I bought an over the shoulder bag to cover it up.' Despite her cancer and the treatment she was undergoing Mrs Giddins continued to coach and play netball. After the drain was removed, she said she felt her freedom return. She was positive, hearing from surgeons that the area was now clear from cancer. Her latest treatment to have a lump on her breast and part of her lung removed took place six weeks before her wedding to Kevin, in August last year . Mrs Giddins returned to her job at a secondary school in Kidderminster, and she and her husband returned to their normal lives. On Christmas Day 2012 - three years after getting together - 32-year-old Mr Giddins proposed and the couple started planning their wedding for August 2013. But, as preparations intensified and the hunt for wedding dresses continued, the couple received the devastating news following a routine CT scan, that the cancer had spread to her lung. Six weeks before her big day, Mrs Giddins had a third of her left lung removed and a lumpectomy on her right breast, throwing the wedding into jeopardy. Melanoma is a rare cancer that begins in the skin and can spread to other organs in the body. The most common sign of the disease is a new mole or a change in an existing mole. This can happen anywhere on the body, but is most often found on the back, legs, arms and face. In most cases, melanomas have an irregular shape and are more than one colour. They also tend to be larger than normal moles and can be itchy or bleed. Melanoma happens when some cells in the skin begin to develop abnormally. It is not known what causes the cancer, but it is thought exposure to UV light from natural or artifical souces may be partly responsible. There are around 13,000 new cases diagnosed in the uK every year. Melanoma is one of the most common cancers in people aged 15 to 34 and is also responsible for most skin cancer deaths. More than 2,000 people a year die in the UK as a result of melanoma. Source: NHS Choices . She said: 'After the operation I didn’t know whether I would be able to walk down the aisle, but the thought of marrying the love of my life really pulled me through. 'When me and Kevin got together I didn’t class myself as a cancer patient as the mole had been gone for two years. 'When it returned though, Kevin was a rock for me - along with my family - and I just wanted to marry him and celebrate our relationship no matter what.' Despite tying the knot in August 2013, their dream honeymoon had to be postponed as Becky could not fly for at least eight weeks post-surgery. Finally, on Christmas Day the pair jetted off to Las Vegas to celebrate their nuptials in style. There Mrs Giddins developed a pain in her side, and in spite of initially passing it off as a urine infection she felt a nagging that it was something more serious. But two days after returning home, doctors confirmed the melanoma had spread to her liver and urethra. She said: 'I don’t like complaining but it just feels like me and Kevin can’t enjoy anything together. 'I’m now on Dabrasenib and Trametinib to try and cure me, but if they don’t work there’s currently only one last set of drugs we can try. 'I’m well aware I’m a bit of a ticking time bomb, but I just want to live a normal life, do a bit of travelling and keep playing netball.' The teacher is working to raise awareness of skin cancer, starting a fund, to which £2,500 has already been donated, for the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Charity's Skin Cancer Fund. Along with his brother Ian, cousin and five close friends, Mr Giddins will climb the highest peaks in England, Wales and Scotland in July.

"By . Emma Innes . A young mother endured a terrifying ordeal when she had a heart attack while eight months pregnant. Antonia Croft, 23, says the shock of seeing her cat Digsby run into traffic brought on shortness of breath and chest pains. She was taken by ambulance to hospital where doctors told her she had experienced a heart attack brought on by an undetected blood clot. Antonia Croft, 23, had a heart attack when she was eight months pregnant with her son, Don'tae . A woman is 10 times more likely to develop a blood clot during pregnancy, statistics show. Ms Croft was warned a natural birth would put her at serious risk and was booked in for a Caesarean section, but she went into labour naturally just four days before her baby was due to be delivered. Thankfully, her son Don’tae was born healthy and today both mother and baby are doing well, although she requires regular monitoring and medication which doctors hope will repair her damaged artery. Miss Croft, who also has a daughter, Shamayah, five, said: ‘Digsby bolted from our front door as I was getting my daughter ready for school. He ran into the road and I screamed as a passing car slammed on its brakes. ‘Afterwards I felt extremely hot, and I couldn’t cool myself down no matter what I tried. I started to feel a pain in my chest.’ Initially putting her discomfort down to her late stage of pregnancy, Miss Croft, of Wavertree, Liverpool, was prescribed painkillers by her GP. But after a sleepless night, she was practically immobile. Miss Croft had the heart attack after seeing her cat, Digsby, run out into traffic . Miss Croft (pictured shortly after Don'tae's birth) was rushed to hospital suffering from chest pains and breathlessness. Doctors were shocked to find she had suffered a heart attack . Miss Croft said: ‘It felt as if someone was sat on my chest. I could hardly breathe and felt pains in my arms and the centre of my back.’ An ambulance was called and Miss Croft, with her concerned boyfriend, postman Lee Foster, 26, beside her, was taken to the Royal Liverpool Hospital before she was transferred to Broadgreen Hospital, where she had to stay on a heart monitor for five days. She said: ‘A scan showed a shadow on my heart. I couldn’t believe I’d had a heart attack. It didn’t seem real. I’d never had any symptoms previously. ‘I was absolutely terrified. My first thought was for my son. I’d found out the sex of the baby at a 20 week scan and couldn’t wait for him to arrive. ‘He was the first boy on my side of the family for 35 years and he meant everything to me. ‘I was distraught at the idea of leaving Shamayah without a mum.’ Miss Croft was told she would need to have a planned C-section for fear her heart wouldn't be able to cope with a natural birth. However, she went into labour before the operation and Don'tae was born naturally . Miss Croft says she was terrified of leaving her daughter without a mother and of something happening to her unborn baby. Image shows her partner, Lee, with Don'tae . Doctors informed her that her heart was too weak for a natural birth and arranged a Caesarean section three weeks before her due date. They also prescribed steroid injections to aid in the development of her unborn son’s lungs, as they were concerned he had been distressed by his mother’s heart attack. But as she lay resting at home on July 20, 2013, awaiting her planned Caesarean on July 24, Miss Croft felt the onset of labour. She said: ‘I was extremely scared. I didn’t know how I would cope with giving birth naturally. I’d been quite panicky during Shamayah’s birth, so I had those memories at the top of my mind, and I prayed that I wouldn’t suffer another attack.’ Don’tae was delivered by midwives as a team of doctors and nurses observed his mother’s status on a heart monitor. Fortunately Digsby was not injured when he ran into the road because the cars braked in time to avoid him . Miss Croft and Don'tae are now healthy but she is being carefully monitored . He was born underweight at 4lb 8oz but today Don’tae is a healthy, happy 10-month-old baby. Miss Croft, now 23, said: ‘I was so relieved to hold him for the first time and Lee was very proud too. ‘Don’tae is growing up very nicely and is an absolute angel. I’ve had to be careful not to push things too much, but Shamayah has been a star by helping me with him. ‘The medical staff at the hospital now want to include my case in a medical journal, because there’s rarely been an example of someone so young experiencing such a serious heart attack and going on to have a problem-free natural labour. ‘It was shocking having a heart attack so young, particularly in the circumstances I was in. I’ve always been active. I walk everywhere and I’m careful about what I eat. I never expected to face anything like this. ‘It’s made me realise that anyone can have a heart attack, no matter their age or their circumstances. Life can change in an instant.’","Antonia Croft was eight months pregnant when cat Digsby ran into traffic .

"By . Emma Innes . A proud father live tweeted the birth of his daughter to keep family and friends up to date with developments. Paul Lorente updated his Twitter followers for almost 24 hours after his wife, Alana, 29, went into labour and gave birth at the Burnley Birthing Unit in Lancashire. Mr Lorente posted his tweets with the hashtag #PrincessBatman – the couple’s nickname for Mrs Lorente’s bump. Paul Lorente live tweeted as his wife, Alana, gave birth to their daughter, Eva Grace, after 24 hours of labour . Mr Lorente says family and friends were 'glued' to their screens waiting for updates . And, he spared his followers no details in the hours before Eva Grace, who has Down’s syndrome, arrived. Tweets he posted included: ‘Just been told we are 4-5 cm dilated. We are being moved to birth suite’ and ‘Pushing’. He eventually announced his daughter’s birth, on May 12, by tweeting: ‘#PrincessBatman born in the pool at 14:27’. Mr Lorente, who lives with his family in Accrington, Lancashire, said: ‘Both me and my wife have big families. We both have lots of friends and we both have an extended church family. ‘We'd told them all that Alana was being induced and everyone said they wanted updates. ‘I just thought that setting up a Twitter account would be the easiest way to do it so that way people could just click the link and see where we were up to without inundating us with phone calls and text messages.’ Mr Lorente admits that there were times during the labour when his wife was not pleased to see him on Twitter . The Princess Batman hashtag has now been . viewed more than 1,500 times and the couple's friends and family say . they were 'glued' to their screens. Mr Lorente, who works as an insurance claims handler, said: ‘We called her Princess Batman because we wanted her real name to be a surprise and because we knew that she had Down’s syndrome, I didn't want people thinking of her as the “Down’s syndrome baby”. I thought she'd prefer a cool alter ego. ‘I had thought that it would be a good idea but I didn't think it would be quite that popular.’ Mr Lorente decided to tweet during the labour and birth as a way of keeping friends and family updated on his wife and daughter's progress . Mr Lorente says they named the bump Princess Batman as they didn't want their unborn baby being known as 'the Down's syndrome baby' But Mrs Lorente, who works as a buyer at a shop in Blackburn, admitted there were times during the labour when seeing her husband tweeting was less than welcome. The couple said part of the decision to Tweet was because there can be complications after the birth of a child with Down’s syndrome. Mrs Lorente said: ‘When we were first told she had Down’s syndrome, I did panic and think: “How can I look after a child with special needs?” ‘But then I realised, all children have “special needs” that need to be met by their parents and so she would be no different at all.’ And she said social media helped her through her pregnancy as she found a Facebook group called 'Future of Downs' where parents share stories. Mr Lorente sent all his tweets with the hashtag #PrincessBatman .","Paul Lorente tweeted while his wife, Alana, gave birth on May 12 .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Smartphones and computers are having to process more information than ever before, but the outdated materials they are made of are not equipped to handle such a steep rise in demand. Now, scientists have found a way to speed up how fast all this information can be processed by developing a new, future-proof class of materials. And they have discovered a quantum effect that enables electrons to dash through the interior of these materials with very little resistance. Scientists from Princeton University have developed a new material, called topological Dirac semi-metal. Its structure means electrons pass through its interior, rather than just along its surface, and this paves the way for electronics, such as phones and tablets, to process information much faster. Illustration pictured . The base material is known as a ‘topological insulator,’ in which electrons move along the surface without penetrating the interior. This latest research, from Princeton University, found electrons also can flow through the interior of some of these materials. These new materials have been called ‘topological Dirac semi-metals’, after English quantum physicist and 1933 Nobel Prize winner Paul Dirac, who was the first to note electrons could behave like light. ‘With this discovery, instead of facing the challenge of how to use only the electrons on the surface of a material, now you can just cut the material open and you have light-like electrons flowing in three dimensions inside the materials,’ said lead researcher M. Zahid Hasan, a professor of physics at Princeton. In most materials, including copper and other metals that conduct electricity, electrons navigate an obstacle course of microscopic outcroppings, ledges and other imperfections that obstruct the  particles and send them scattering in the wrong directions. This causes resistance and the conversion of electrical current into heat, which is why electronic appliances become warm during use. In topological insulators, and the new class of materials the Princeton researchers studied, the unique properties of the atoms combine to create quantum effects that coax electrons into acting similar to a light wave, instead of like individual particles. These properties were theoretically proposed by Charles Kane and a team at the University of Pennsylvania in 2005. In 2011, the Dr Hasan detected this fast electron-flow in the interior of a material made from combining several elements - bismuth, pictured, thallium, sulfur and selenium . These waves can weave, dodge and even move through barriers that would typically stop most electrons. These properties were theoretically proposed by Charles Kane and a team at the University of Pennsylvania from 2005 to 2007, but wasn't observed experimentally in solid materials until 2007. In 2011, Dr Hasan group detected this fast electron-flow in the interior of a material made from combining several elements - bismuth, thallium, sulfur and selenium. The term topological insulator is now quite well known, but the term insulator means there are no electrons flowing in the bulk of . the material. This new study shows that electrons are flowing in the bulk . of the material, meaning cadmium arsenide is not an insulator but is . still topological in nature, making it a completely new type of quantum matter. The research was conducted by an international team of scientists from the U.S., Taiwan, Singapore, Germany and Sweden and published in two papers in the journal Nature Communications. The materials were named after English quantum physicist and 1933 Nobel Prize winner Paul Dirac, pictured, who noted electrons could behave like light . This team demonstrated fast electrons can flow through crystals made from cadmium and arsenic, or cadmium arsenide, as well as elements bismuth and selenium. During tests into cadmium arsenide, in particular, the electrons had an average velocity that was 10,000 times more than that of the previous bismuth-based materials identified by the group. ‘This is a big deal,’ Dr Hasan said. ‘It means the electrons can flow quite easily in the material and many more exotic quantum effects can now be studied. 'That just wasn't possible in the past.’ These materials would be ideal for electronics that do calculations and transmit information. The speeds achieved by these electrons have led to comparisons to another novel electronic material - graphene. The semi-metals have the potential to be superior to graphene in some aspects, Dr Hasan said, because graphene is a single layer of atoms in which electrons can flow only in two dimensions. Cadmium arsenide permits electrons to flow in three dimensions, for example.","Scientists at Princeton University have developed a new class of materials .

According to the chart, Rose covers five octaves ranging from F1 on There Was A Time, from the 2008 album Chinese Democracy, up to Bb6 on Ain’t It Fun from the 1991 album “The Spaghetti Incident?“. Although Mariah Carey has the highest note of the group, hitting G7 in 1991 hit Emotions, she is in second place to Rose’s range. That said, Carey covers four octaves on Emotions alone. Her lowest note is F2 on Sweetheart in 1998. Rounding off the top three is Prince (E2 to B6), Steven Tyler (D2 to E6) and James Brown (Eb2 to E6). At the opposite end of the scale is country singer Luke Bryan ranging from A2 on You Make Me Want To, up to A4 on Over The River both from 2007. The lowest female is Taylor Swift hitting F#5 in You Belong With Me in 2008, down to E3 on Begin Again in 2012. Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose, pictured, ranges from note F1 on There Was A Time, from the 2008 album Chinese Democracy, up to Bb6 on Ain't It Fun from the 1991 album ""The Spaghetti Incident?"".

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Some robots can mimic human expressions, while others walk like man. But in order to help humans better understand the intention of robots, one team is working on a droid that sweats when it is nervous. Another prototype robot gets goosebumps when there is a cold breeze or it is told a scary story. A team of roboticists is working on a droid that sweats when it is nervous and another prototype that gets goosebumps when it is cold or scared. A stock image of a robot displaying 'emotion' is pictured . A group of roboticists led by Tomoko Yonezawa at Kansai University in Osaka, Japan, are creating the machines which show physiological reactions, IEEE Spectrum reported. Their third prototype is a teddy bear called Bretter that uses a fan to make breath when it is talking. More air is produced when the bear is speaking loudly than quietly – so when it whispers it seems more ‘realistic’. The idea behind the machines is that by giving robots involuntary reactions, humans can have a better idea of their intentions. Scientists think that if they look visibly anxious or frightened by showing easily-recognisable signs, we are more likely to accept and feel at ease with them. Roboticists might create machines that show their intentions, but a math model says emotional machines like Marvin the android from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (pictured) won't exist . One of the prototype droids can show it is under pressure or anxious by sweating from its forehead, rather than stating its ‘emotions,’ which researchers from Georgia Tech described as ‘awkward’. But no information has been revealed so far about just how it does this. Swiss robot expert Marco Tempest explained in a recent TED talk that not being able to have an idea of a robot’s intentions makes humans nervous. ‘When someone hands an object to you, you can read intention in their eyes, their face, their body language. That's not true of the robot,’ he said. Dr Yonezawa said that while humans sometimes make facial expressions that disguise what they are really thinking, involuntary responses such as sweating and shivering reveal their ‘true feelings’ and the same could be true of robots in the future. While robots are being developed that can hint at genuine reactions, one mathematician from the National University of Ireland in Maynooth has said that robots will ‘never’ have real feelings. Phil Maguire said that computers can't handle any process that completely integrates information, so they cannot be conscious and capable of feeling. A mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness suggests that emotional machines will never exist. This is because computers can't handle any process that completely integrates information, so they cannot be conscious and capable of feeling, one expert claims. A mathematical framework for consciousness, developed over the last decade by Giulio Tononi at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says that the ability to integrate information is a key feature of consciousness. He believes that integrated information can't be broken down into smaller components in conscious minds, because the brain contextualises information. Phil Maguire of the National University of Ireland in Maynooth, used mathematics to show that computers cannot handle the complex processes needed to mesh pieces of information together seamlessly. Therefore, if consciousness is based on the integration of lots of pieces of information, computers can’t be conscious and capable of experiencing emotions like humans. Professor Maguire says that consciousness cannot be created in a physical machine in finite time using limited memory. ‘It doesn't necessarily mean that there is some magic going on in the brain that involves some forces that can't be explained physically. It is just so complex that it's beyond our abilities to reverse it and decompose it,’ he said.","Roboticists at Kansai University in Osaka, Japan have created three prototype robots that show physiological reactions .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . The privacy of instant messages has become a hot topic in recent months with the spotlight being shone on popular services like Facebook, Snapchat and WhatsApp. So it’s timely that SRD Wireless has announced the launch of PQChat - an app for iOS devices based on the company’s own ‘Never-The-Same’ (NTS) encryption. PQChat is essentially an instant messenger with a twist - its encryption system has never been broken, and the company even claims future quantum computers will not be able to break it. SRD Wireless has unveiled their PQChat app, which they claim is the world’s first ‘quantum-proof’ messenger. Users are in complete control of their messages and can apparently delete them remotely if necessary (left), while only messages can only be read by approved contacts (right) Designed to make communications between people and businesses as safe, secure and private as possible, NTS protects data using the McEliece cryptosystem, the strongest currently known. McEliece is an encryption algorithm developed in 1978 by mathematician Robert McEliece that has never been broken - even using techniques designed for the new era of quantum computing. PQChat allows users to share and delete encrypted messages, voice, video and images as they desire, whilst the application itself holds no personal information on users. As a result, SRD Wireless said users can have the utmost confidence that their private communications remain just that. ‘The ongoing Snowden revelations have brought home just how easily accessible our personal information is to the NSA or other groups,’ said Andersen Cheng, co-founder and CEO of SRD Wireless. ‘Yet most people are still handing over information to data miners, spammers and criminals without understanding what they are doing.’ ‘People need to take back control of their data: even the smallest amount of personal information can compromise your privacy and security. ‘Modern communication tools simply aren’t built with this as a priority and so make compromises in order to allow communication. ‘Our aim with PQChat is to place end-to-end security at the heart of the application.’ Minimal user information . Most communication tools require users to share a large amount of personal information. PQChat only stores a one-way encrypted value of the user’s phone number, which cannot be reconstructed, plus an encrypted user-supplied nickname and pseudo ID image. This makes the user’s identity impossible to determine. User-defined passwords . PQChat allows users to set their own Master Password to sign up to the service, as well as a five-digit alphanumeric PIN. PQChat does not even store the Master Password in the app, meaning that users have complete control over their own security. Video and Voice authentication . To ensure a message recipient is who they claim to be, PQChat uses SRD’s patented Man At The End (MATE) authentication. By providing a video and audio authentication message, users can be certain of each others’ identity. Locker . To guarantee important information isn’t lost, PQChat includes a secure locker where users can store information that they want to guarantee is kept safe and private. Complete control over messages . As well as sending, users can remotely delete messages, whether manually or after a particular length of time. Users can also be sent an acknowledgement, to provide a guarantee that crucial messages have been seen and read. User controlled . You can remote-delete your own messages and have full control over your own passwords, meaning nobody can share dodgy holiday snaps or drunk texts except you. Data mining-proof . 'A quite frankly terrifying amount of information is out there on you for anyone who wants to grab it; and apps like WhatsApp and Snapchat don’t help by hoovering up your contact details and passwords to store,' said the design team. 'PQChat stores nothing on you - not even your phone number, messages or password - meaning it couldn’t share the details around even if it wanted to.' Secure . 'Instead of making compromises and taking shortcuts to make chatting that little bit easier, PQChat has been designed the hard way to be totally secure from the ground up. 'Its technology has been thoroughly tested and is future-proofed against upcoming methods that can break security wide open.' Current encryption tools are facing a major threat from the ongoing evolution of quantum computing, which will make breaking even highly sophisticated algorithms simple and immediate. Most of the existing encryption standards have already been broken in theory, with only the IT horsepower needed to actually run these processes preventing widespread attacks. Quantum computing provides all the horsepower such techniques need, meaning that these standards will be wide open. PQChat is the first product to be based on SRD’s own patented NTS encryption that they claim is invulnerable to quantum computing. To avoid any possible attacker detecting patterns in a user’s messages, NTS randomises messages’ appearance. Regardless of content, every time a user encrypts the same message, the output will be completely different, making messages incomprehensible to everyone except the intended recipient. As a result, PQChat is claimed to be as future-proof as it’s possible to be. Within the app users can set messages to 'self-destruct' (left) so they delete themselves after a certain amount of time, while a variety of symbols (right) tell you the status of your message. Like other apps users can also embed videos, videos and voice . ‘Even if an application or service claims to be secure, the data it holds still represents a risk,’ continued Cheng. ‘For example, if an application stores personal details then a security breach can put all users at risk. ‘Apart from having zero knowledge of any message contents, SRD Wireless vows not to obtain, store or share any personal details or password information from PQChat users: it is our belief that ultimately your security should be in your hands, not ours. ‘Since SRD’s business model is based around selling solutions to enterprises rather than data mining, there is no need for us to hold any of this information. ‘Quite simply, if we cannot guarantee this trust between us and our users, then all of our claims about the security of PQChat itself are worthless.’ As well as consumers and workers using PQChat to send secure, private messages, SRD said they can provide custom applications to suit specific enterprise needs. For example the legal, healthcare and financial services industries all have a need to support confidential, secure messaging across and between businesses.","SRD Wireless has launched an app with an advanced encryption algorithm .

"By . Lizzie Parry . An HIV-positive teenager has today called for lessons about the virus to become compulsory in all schools, claiming he learned nothing of it in sex eduction classes. Luke Alexander has written an open letter to Education Secretary Michael Gove, declaring he 'did not know much' about the disease before contracting it. The 19-year-old appeared on ITV's This Morning, where he called for greater awareness 12 months after he received his devastating diagnosis. In his letter, published as a petition . on the Change.org website, Mr Alexander claims the 'vast majority of . young people today have little or no common knowledge', of the virus. HIV-positive Luke Alexander is calling on Education Secretary Michael Gove to make HIV a compulsory part of sex education in all schools . He said: 'I myself strongly believe that if I had learnt about HIV during my secondary education, I might have avoided being infected with HIV myself at just 18 years old,' the Independent reported. Mr Alexander, from Oldbury in the West Midlands, said education is vital if a younger generation are to be as aware of the condition as men who were exposed to the major awareness campaign of the 1980s. He said: 'Before my diagnosis I didn't really know a lot about it (HIV). 'When they diagnosed me last year, my first reaction was ""Oh my God, I'm going to die"". 'I knew it existed but I didn't know a lot about treatment.' Mr Alexander, who was around 13 when he came out as being gay, said he became sexually active at the age of 15. When he turned 18 his life took a downwards turn. Having been made redundant, he turned to alcohol and recreational drugs. Appearing on ITV's This Morning, the 19-year-old - who was diagnosed last year - said he learned very little about the virus at school, adding had he had more information he might not have contracted the illness . It was during that time, he says, that he 'went off the rails' becoming less careful in his sexual life, adding that he can 'count on one hand' the number of times he has practised unsafe sex. Had he been told more about the dangers of HIV while at school, he claims it could have made a real difference. The teenager said his sex education lessons at school had a tendency to focus on the dangers of becoming pregnant and contracting chlamydia, but missed out the link between wearing a condom and protecting against HIV and other infections. 'We did talk about condoms,' he said. 'But it was more in the context of getting pregnant and bacterial infections. Mr Alexander said he wants to raise greater awareness, especially among young homosexual men . 'We never really went into anything else. I have always known it was necessary (to use a condom) but it wasn't stressed (in the context of HIV).' It was in April 2013, while he was in Manchester, that Mr Alexander first fell ill, showing the signs of HIV. 'All of a sudden I came down with a horrific fever, it was very instant, I had sweats and could not sleep. 'The next thing I knew I was off my food and very, very fatigued. It was awful. 'Before my diagnosis I didn't really know a lot about it. When they diagnosed me last year, my first reaction was ""Oh my God, I'm going to die""' - Luke Alexander . 'I found out later it was sero-conversion illness, where my body was trying to reject the virus.' In May last year, Mr Alexander said he had a free sexual health test offered by a charity at the Birmingham Gay Pride event. Thinking nothing of the tests, he said he was shocked when he received a call to say his results showed 'cause for concern'. Enduring the 'worst five days' of his life, Mr Alexander was forced to wait for further test results before his diagnosis was confirmed, he was HIV positive. Speaking about his experience of sex education at school, Mr Alexander said he did not 'get the information I felt I needed at the time'. 'Being gay, HIV is up there on the list of things affecting men across the world. Dr Ranj Singh, who appeared alongside Mr Alexander, supported his call for greater awareness in schools . 'We heard a lot about chlamydia and pregnancy but nothing in much depth, the teachers were embarrassed to talk about it. 'I felt they were speaking about it because they had to, because the government were telling them to. 'But it left no impression.' He called for more information to be made available around treatment of the virus. On diagnosis, Mr Alexander said he thought he would be resigned to a short, bed-ridden life in pain, facing stigma from society. But the reality is very different, with great leaps forward in treatment during the 1990s and 2000s. The 19-year-old now takes just one pill a day. Dr Ranj Singh, who appeared on the show with Mr Alexander, said a survey by the National Aids Trust in April 2014 found the level of knowledge about HIV in young gay men is 'shockingly low' - and worse than in older men. He said 100,000 people in the UK are living with the virus, though 20,000 of those are unaware they have the condition. A Department of Education spokesman said: 'Pupils must learn about sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS as part of sex and relationship education.'","Luke Alexander, 19, was diagnosed with HIV last summer .

The figures reveal a growth of some 16 million users since the company's last user disclosure in March 2013. Despite the strong growth, Spotify still lags rival music streaming service Pandora, which boasts 75 million active users. 'We've had an amazing year, growing from 20 markets to 56 as people from around the world embrace streaming music,' said Daniel Ek, CEO and Founder, Spotify. 10 million subscribers is an important milestone for both Spotify and the entire music industry,' 'We’re widening our lead in the digital music space and will continue to focus on getting everyone in the world to listen to more music.' Spotify now has 10 million paying subscribers and more than 40 million active users across 56 markets. Since the service launched in 2008, users have created over 1.5 billion playlists, collectively creating or updating over 5 million playlists each day. 'Spotify’s growth and global reach is not only significant for us, but for the entire music industry,' the firm said. 'Since 2008, Spotify has driven over $1 billion dollars to rights holders.' The service also revealed its most popular songs and artists. Eminem is the most streamed artist of all time, and Rihanna the most streamed female artist. David Guetta is the second most streamed male artist and Katy Perry the second most streamed female artist of all time. 'Wake Me Up' by Avicii is the most streamed song of all time with more than 235 million streams, while David Guetta is the most followed artist on Spotify with more than 5 million followers. In the past month: Top 100 Pop Tracks on Spotify was the most streamed playlist, while Clean Bandit’s “Rather Be feat. Jess Glynne” was the most played song in offline mode. Spotify has faced increasing competition over the past year as rival services such as Apple's iTunes Radio launched in a bid to capture a slice of streaming revenue. At the same time, Spotify has faced criticism from some in the music industry over the supposedly meagre royalties it pays artists. Dr. Dre, who founded Beats electronics with record producer music producer Jimmy Iovine. The firm could now be sold to Apple. Eminem is the most streamed artist of all time on spotify, and Rihanna the most streamed female artist. David Guetta is the second most streamed male artist and Katy Perry the second most streamed female artist of all time. 'Wake Me Up' by Avicii is the most streamed song of all time with more than 235 million streams, while David Guetta is the most followed artist on Spotify with more than 5 million followers. In the past month: Top 100 Pop Tracks on Spotify was the most streamed playlist, while Clean Bandit’s “Rather Be feat. Jess Glynne” was the most played song in offline mode. The company defended such charges late last year, revealing that it paid an average 'per-stream' sum of between $0.006 and $0.0084. Gross payments would increase as more users signed up, it said, though it cautioned that royalties depended on where the music was produced and where it was listened to. The figures come as Apple is believed to be finalising a deal to by headphone maker Beats Electronics for $3.2bn. The firm, founded by music producer Jimmy Iovine and the hip-hop star Dr Dre, is best known for its distinctive headphones. It is claimed a deal could be announced within days - possibly at Apple's annual developer conference on June 2nd - and mark Apple boss Tim Cook's biggest ever acquisition. Apple will acquire Beats’ streaming music service, which launched this year, and its audio equipment business, which includes its brand of headphones and audio equipment, according to a report in the Financial Times. The Beats management team will report to Mr Cook, said people familiar with the deal. Apple and Beats declined to comment. However, Apple boss Tim Cook said last month Apple was 'on the prowl' for more acquisitions, after buying 24 companies in the past 18 months and he was not averse to large acquisitions. The potential $3.2 billion deal would mark Apple’s largest acquisition of another company ever. It is believed Apple is also interested in Beats expertise in developing wearable products and it edges closer to a much anticipated iWatch launch, . Beats has also partnered with a host of celebrities, including Lady Gaga, to create endorsed  earphones. The Beats move follows a string of high-priced deals in Silicon Valley, after Google acquired smart home developer Nest Labs for $3.2bn and Facebook offered an initial $19bn for WhatsApp Messenger, and then bought VR firm Oculus for $2bn. Apple executives Tim Cook and Eddy Cue have previously met with Iovine to discuss streaming music services and Apple and Beats have partnered up to sell Beats earphone products in Apple Retail stores .","Streaming firm Spotify has 40m global users - and 10m paying users .

Researchers in Switzerland have fitted 14 cows with cannulas in their sides, that are cut directly into the animal’s digestive tract. The 8-inch (20cm) holes allow farmers to directly see how food is being processed, and are plugged using rubber stoppers when not being used. Scroll down for video . Researchers in Switzerland have fitted 14 cows with cannulas, pictured, in their sides that are cut directly into the cow's digestive tract, and fitted with a plug. The 8-inch (20cm) holes allow farmers to see how food is being processed, and to analyse the animal's energy efficiency . The cannula acts like a porthole and gives direct access to the cow’s rumen.

The practice is said to have become common place in the 1920s but reports of cows being used in this way for scientific research date back to 1833. Cows with cannulas fitted are also known as fistulated cows. Researchers claim the process can help the environment by improving the energy efficiency of cows, which in turn reduces the amount of methane they produce. The cows are anaesthetised during the surgical procedure and are said to experience no pain when being examined. But animal rights campaigners claim it is abuse .

"EXCLUSIVE By . Mark Duell . This is the moment an inventor’s boyhood dream came to life - when he watched a surfer glide across a lake with a handheld electric jet engine for the first time. Doug Foden took to the Chasewater lake in Staffordshire to test the device - which is capable of helping users travel at up to 50mph, and effectively acts as an alternative to wind. Watching from dry land last week was 40-year-old engineer Adam Contoret, who has spent two years at his garage in Stoke-on-Trent developing the water-resistant jet engine thrusters. Scroll down for video . Electric jet engine surfing: Doug Foden took to the Chasewater lake in Staffordshire to test the device . Unusual sight: The electric thrusters can give surfers such as Mr Foden speeds of up to 50mph on water . On water: An engineer has spent two years at his garage developing the water-resistant jet engine thruster . The married father-of-one told MailOnline: ‘When I was about 14, a friend of the family bought us a model aircraft engine - and when my brother and I were testing it, we put it on a wooden board. ‘That planted in my mind the idea of having some sort of stand propulsion for a board sport. Years went by and I did paragliding. I made this little bar with two engines and it worked. ‘So, then I thought let's make something that you can control the power on. It's just me - I'm not some big company. I spoke with a patent attorney, and we put some drawings together. ‘It's still patent pending. I tried it on water quite a while ago using a small bar, but there wasn't enough power. This is the first time it's been done on a lake with an expert.’ Dr Contoret, who is the founder and . director of engineering firm Dreamscience, said his technology is still . in the early stages, because the device only lasts for ten minutes . before the batteries run out. It is also quite heavy for users, but . Dr Contoret added that he expects technology to have improved so much in . five years that the device will be half the weight and double the . power. Diagram: The apparatus (10) includes first and second air-moving thrusters (16) arranged at opposite ends of a rigid device (1). The D arrows show possible rotations of the device, the user is 100 and his connection to the unit is 28. The thrusters' housing is 18, and the propeller is 24 . Explained: Another diagram of the device, seen from the front this time, which is two years in the making. The numbers in the above caption correspond to the same parts in this image . At the moment, the . developers are using several battery packs for testing the device, but . it can then be recharged either with a generator or by plugging it back . in. Dr Contoret added that . one of the device’s major benefits is that the air coming out of it is . cold, and that it can handle impact with water - but he is working on a . fully-waterproof version. ‘It's safe because it's cold,’ he said. ‘And if you crash you've something to land on.’ Dr Contoret's aim now is to see the device - which he expects to come with a retail price of £3,000 to £6,000 once it is commercially released - used by a team of athletes in a competitive event. Mr Foden, an experienced windsurfer and snowboarder, told MailOnline: ‘The hard thing to begin with was how heavy it is, but once you’ve got enough thrust going it takes its own weight. ‘Initially it's pretty awkward to balance until you come up to speed. It's very experimental, and we're really excited about what other things to do with it.’ He added: ‘I only had it half throttle, and it was 25mph - from a windsufing point of view, that's an average speed that most competent windsurfers can get to on a good day. Development: Adam Contoret, 40, has spent two years developing the water-resistant jet engine thruster . Smiles: Mr Foden (right) watches back his jet engine surfing attempt on the Chasewater lake in Staffordshire . ‘As you accelerate harder, the bar that you're holding wants to take off, so unless you can keep your arms steady, your arms gradually raise up in the arm and the thrust is then pushing you down rather than along. So you're performing a balancing act.’ Dr Contoret said of seeing the device in action on the water: ‘It took me back to when I was a kid with my model aircraft engine, just having a go. We sometimes forget that we can have a bit of fun.’ 'The physics of it are quite spectacular, to get enough power to do what the wind does' Adam Contoret, inventor . Dr Contoret said he was also proud of achieving what he had mocked up in a concept image on Adobe Photoshop two years ago - and that the thruster could also be used for snowboarding. He added: ‘The physics of it are quite spectacular, to get enough power to do what the wind does. A snowboard, skateboard - anything you want to jump on - this is your power-kite.’ And he said of his four-year-old daughter: ‘She thinks it's normal for people to have a set of thrusters - because she hasn't seen any other. There are two kids in my house - me and my daughter.’","Doug Foden took to Chasewater lake in Staffordshire to test new device .

"By . Mark Prigg . Pancreatic cancer is expected to become the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States in 2020, overtaking deaths from breast and colon cancers, according to new research. The disease, which claimed the lives of both Steve Jobs and Patrick Swayze, is set for a 'startling' rise. Currently, the top three causes of cancer-related death in the United States are lung, colorectal and breast cancers. The disease, which caused the deaths of both Steve Jobs and Patrick Swayze, is set for a 'startling' rise. Currently, the top three causes of cancer-related death in the United States are lung, colorectal and breast cancers. Pancreatic cancer begins in the tissues of the pancreas — an organ in your abdomen that lies horizontally behind the lower part of your stomach. The pancreas secretes enzymes that aid digestion and hormones that help regulate the metabolism of sugars. Pancreatic cancer often has a poor prognosis, even when diagnosed early, and spreads rapidly. It is seldom detected in its early stages, which is a major reason why it's a leading cause of cancer death. Pancreatic cancer is fourth, followed by prostate and liver cancers. In 2030, lung cancer will remain the top killer, but pancreatic cancer will move to second, followed by liver cancer and colorectal cancer, according to the report from the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PCAN). In addition, the study reports that the number of thyroid cancer diagnoses is predicted to increase dramatically. By combining predicted demographic changes and changes to the incidence and death rates of specific cancers, the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network was able to project numbers of diagnoses and deaths for major cancers in the US in the coming years. Overall, it is encouraging that the cancer death rate in the US is declining each year, and the numbers of deaths caused by several major cancers such as lung, colorectal, and breast are following that trend and dropping, the researchers said. However, they admit the increase in pancreatic cancer numbers was shocking. 'The projections for deaths from pancreatic and liver cancers are startling,' said Lynn Matrisian of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, and senior author of the paper. 'This study is a call to action to the scientific and clinical communities, as well as the population at large, to increase attention, awareness, and ultimately progress in the fight against pancreatic cancer.' There are many factors that have contributed to the lack of sufficient progress in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer, researchers say. Historically, the disease was understudied and underfunded. In an effort to double pancreatic cancer survival by 2020, the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network is intensifying efforts to heighten awareness, raise funds for comprehensive private research, and advocate for dedicated federal research to advance early diagnostics, better treatments, and increase chances of survival. The disease also took the life of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Researchers say the prediction should be a call to action. Due to these efforts, The Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act was signed into law by President Obama in January 2013, which requires the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to develop a scientific framework to conduct and support research for recalcitrant cancers, including pancreatic and lung. As a result of the law, the NCI issued a Scientific Framework for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma in February 2014. This report includes plans for implementation of the recommended initiatives toward making significant advances in pancreatic cancer research, diagnosis, and treatment. The societal burden of these particularly deadly cancer types will become greater in the coming years, and now is the time to allocate the resources and effort necessary to alleviate the suffering caused by these diseases. A recent report released by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), State of Cancer Care in America: 2014, predicts that cancer will become the number one killer in the US by the year 2030. 'This further emphasizes the urgency of making progress against pancreatic cancer, and other leading cancer killers,' added Matrisian.","Expected to overtake deaths from breast and colon cancers .

Kev Martin, from Logan in Brisbane's south, has been a shopping centre security guard for 22 years, apprehending shoppers with sticky fingers. But in his spare time, the father-of-seven - known affectionately as the Kevinator - continues his work by nabbing those who break the law and documents it. Kev Martin has been a security officer for 22 years and in his spare times catches suspected criminals . In dramatic footage shown on A Current Affair, Mr Martin has helped catch an array of suspects from those who shoplift to a suspected drink driver who runs a red light and collides with a pregnant woman's vehicle. The alleged drink driver - a woman who is seen to be slurring her speech - starts abusing Mr Martin when he takes her keys out of the ignition after the collision. The woman then starts throwing things at an unseen person who is by the passenger door. 'She is clearly freaking out, she's all over the shop and just punches the ambulance officer,' Mr Martin said. 'I just immediately threw her out of the car and pin her to the ground so the ambulance officers (can do their job).' He helps chase down suspects on the run from police, not just in his hometown of Logan - in Brisbane's south, but interstate as well . In another incident, Mr Martin spots smoke billowing into the sky from a house on the way to work. He was the first one on the scene at the house fire and tried to save the family dog who was thought to be stuck inside. Failing to find the dog, Mr Martin got the residents away from the house just in case they were in danger. Luckily firefighters were able to locate the dog after they arrived. Mr Martin stopped this woman from driving away after she hit a pregnant woman's car while running a red light . But Mr Martin's jurisdiction extends into other states. While holidaying in Melbourne, Mr Martin caught a man taking $700 worth of cosmetics and forced him to empty his pockets on camera. 'It just keeps coming and you can see my face in this video clip here. I'm shocked at how much he's got,' Mr Martin said. 'I think it was 26 bottles.' The father-of-seven was first on the scene when a fire broke out at a family home . To be in the right place at the right time, Mr Martin tunes into police radios to keep tabs on offenders. 'You see this face you'll get caught. That's for sure,' he warned. Mr Martin is a trained security guard, so police advise people not to confront someone breaking the law.

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @@CraigHope01 . Joe Hart admits he would back himself to score a penalty for England at the World Cup in Brazil this summer, having previously held his nerve in a shootout. It was at the UEFA European Under 21 Championship in 2009 that the goalkeeper converted during the shootout victory over Sweden — and he also tucked one away for Manchester City against LA Galaxy. Trusty: Hart scored a penalty in the shoot out win over Sweden in the U21 European Championships in 2009 . One-on-one: Hart speaks to Sportsmail's Craig Hope during a media goalkeeping masterclass . England, of course, have gone out of six of the past 10 major inter-national tournaments via penalties and Hart was in goal at the Euros two years ago when Italy were their spot-kick conquerors. This time, the 27-year-old says he would have no issue with stepping up as one of England’s penalty- takers. ‘I’d be confident enough to take one,’ he said. ‘I’d never say no if I was asked and you never know — I’ve seen it happen before. ‘I quite enjoy taking them and, although it probably won’t come down to me, I’d have no problem. I’ve done it before.’ It was the policy of Under 21 boss . Stuart Pearce to select the players who were finding the back of the net . in training — and that was enough to see Hart installed as his second . taker. Taste for it: Joe Hart celebrates... but will he be gleaming after scoring a penalty in the World Cup? Seasoned pro: Joe Hart will be going to his third major tournament with England . Fresh from celebrating City’s  second Barclays Premier League title in three seasons, Hart said: ‘We’d been practising them daily with  Stuart Pearce and I’d scored most of mine. His system was that he went with the lads who were scoring — and I was scoring. ‘He was confident in me and I was confident in myself and I ended up putting it away.’ Hart’s prime objective, of course,  will be saving penalties should  England find themselves involved in another shootout in Brazil. He was beaten by Andrea Pirlo’s chip in 2012 and the Italian has since revealed that Hart’s decision to dive early prompted his audacious effort. All fronts: Fresh from celebrating City's title win, Hart is looking for even greater success this summer . Three Lions: England face Italy on June 14 in Manaus to kick off their World Cup campaign . ‘That was his way of scoring and that’s fair enough — if the ball crosses the line it’s a good penalty, no matter what you do,’ Hart said, ‘but all  penalty-takers are different. ‘Rickie (Lambert) is one of the best and he picks his spot beforehand, others change their mind. ‘I watch a lot of penalties before a game in preparation. It’s a big moment. You need to prepare as best you can. ‘That means watching the DVDs and working on them in training. We do that a lot in tournament football because it can be so crucial. Full stretch: Hart wants to have his own 'David Seaman moment' for England at this summer's World Cup . ‘Sadly, at the end of the DVD it doesn’t say, “This is the way he will definitely go”, but what it can do is give you that slight percentage advantage and that might make the difference.’ Should England make it to a shootout many observers will already feel they have surpassed expectation. A group which contains Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica could prove difficult to negotiate, although Hart says Roy Hodgson’s men are taking little notice of their outsider status. ‘We’ll be confident,’ he said. ‘A lot of lads have had very good seasons. I feel that we’ve improved over the past two years under the new manager. We’re playing as a unit and there is a good feel to the team. ‘We’ve got a very good mix of youth and experience and I honestly think we could surprise a few people.’","The England goalkeeper insists Roy Hodgson can back him to score .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . If your idea of a delicious meal is anything from fish and chips to a Sunday roast, you may want to look away now. A student in Iceland has created a range of meals based on everyday foods, but with one major difference - they're all produced using liquefied and blended insects. The Fly Factory was designed by graduate Búi Bjarmar Aðalsteinsson and during taste tests, diners were none the wiser. Scroll down for videos . Icelandic product design graduate Búi Bjarmar Aðalsteinsson has created a Fly Factory (pictured) that breeds insect larvae for human consumption. Using the micro-factory he has created larvae pâté and a coconut-choclate flavoured dessert, and he said his project could be used to help alleviate global food shortages . Aðalsteinsson's creations aren’t really designed to put chefs out of business, however - instead they're intended as a solution to the growing problem of food shortages around the world. Aðalsteinsson's meals were inspired by a 2013 report by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations called Edible Insects, which investigated how insects could solve food shortages. He then constructed a micro-factory at the Icelandic Academy of Arts where he started cooking up the dishes. In the ‘kitchen’ there are three areas. The main section houses larvae, which eat table scraps and then excrete onto plants, with their faeces acting as a fertiliser. The larvae are then harvested for eating; they are cooked in an oven before being liquiefied in a blender. Aðalsteinsson mixes the blended larvae with other flavourings to make food that he says will appeal to western tastes. In February researchers at London South Bank University unveiled their sustainable insect snacks. Made from a mixture of dung beetles, mealworms and crickets, the researchers claimed the snacks could be developed to help feed a growing global population. Their prototypes were apparently rich in protein and included crunch cinnamon snacks that were 3D-printed using the ground bugs. Meanwhile, back in October 2013 students at McGill University were awarded $1 million (£600,000) to turn insects into flour. The goal of the project was to turn this into bread and other foods. The project, known as Flour Power, is hoped to provide a sustainable, year-round source of food as well as provide an extra business opportunity for local farmers. His creations include larvae pâté, which apparently tastes like chicken, and a coconut-chocolate flavoured dessert. The whole system produces zero waste, making it ideal for creating food where there are shortages. In addition, he says larvae contain similar amounts of protein, fat and nutrients to other forms of meat, but crucially they need they need five to ten times less food. Aðalsteinsson did a taste test - of sorts - to see how the public reacted to the food. ‘To my surprise, most of the visitors were very intrigued, especially the children,’ he wrote on his website. ‘One four-year-old-girl insisted upon getting a pet fly to take home.’ Within the insect kitchen, larvae are kept with plants and soil. The excrement of the larvae is used to fertilise the plants, while the larvae are ultimately harvested for use in the food. The entire micro-factory produces zero waste and the larvae require five to ten times less food to produce the same nutrients as other forms of meat . The larvae are cooked inside an oven before being liquefied in a blender. Aðalsteinsson then combines this with other ingredients such as spices in order to make the taste more appealing to western cultures. He claims there is no bug-like taste and, in fact, some of the foods actually taste like chicken . But, he conceded, even though ‘most people are very interested in the project and its prospects’ not everyone was willing to try the food. ‘It is very probable that elements of the project will be developed for further production in an industrial setting,’ he continues. This could include fish feeding initiatives. ‘As far as this project goes my hope is that it will be made available for research and further development. ‘One of the big aspects of this project is to invoke interest in the circular production visible in nature. ‘This idea of a waste-less production will hopefully inspire others to rethink linear production which produces great amounts of waste and unused by-products.’ After baking the final mixture in an oven, Aðalsteinsson then has his final product. This is an image of the larvae paté. Aðalsteinsson hopes his project can inspire research and development in the field of using insects as food in order to tackle the growing problem of feeding Earth's population .","An Icelandic graduate student has created food using liquefied larvae .

Listening to FA chairman Greg Dyke struggle to pronounce Luis Suarez’s name as he spoke at the Football Writers’ Association Awards last week, it struck me that he might actually not know what he’s talking about. His passionate belief that we need to find a way to get more English players into Premier League first teams is sound enough: but the logic behind his solution is shambolic at best. I interviewed Connor Wickham this week, the Sunderland striker who was thrown into the first team by Gus Poyet, and who subsequently rewarded the manager’s faith with the goals that produced the miracle of the great escape at The Stadium of Light. Faith repaid: English striker Connor Wickham contributed crucial goals as Sunderland escaped the Premier League relegation zone . Right choice: Sunderland manager Gus Poyet opted for Wickham over Jozy Altidore . It might seem like a no-brainer – do you select Wickham or Jozy Altidore? The American had a spell at Hull City but scored just one Premier League goal and he was sent off in a crucial defeat which virtually sealed the club’s relegation. Undeterred, Sunderland decided to bring Altidore back to this country on a whopping four-year contract and he has scored one Premier League goal this season. Some would say Wickham was overpriced at £8.1m - it fits with the myth that English players are too expensive. Well Erik Lamela cost £30m, Roberto Soldado £26m – how have they been getting on? Joe Hart cost Manchester City £600,000 and Leighton Baines cost Everton just £5.9m from Wigan. These two would get into most top European sides. English players don’t have to cost a fortune, not if you look hard enough. But even when they do they can be worth it. Wayne Rooney has provided Manchester United with value for money in terms of the transfer fee in the 10 years since his £27m switch from Everton. Sound investment: England left-back Leighton Baines cost Everton £5.9m when they signed him from Wigan . Value for money: Wayne Rooney cost Manchester United £27m a decade ago but has repaid them in full . There have been some young English players put into Premier League teams this season who have flourished: Jon Flanagan at Liverpool is a great example – he didn’t let anyone down. Ross Barkley at Everton, Dwight Gayle and Joel Ward at Crystal Palace, Jack Colback and Wickham at Sunderland, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain at Arsenal, Ravel Morrison at West Ham, and numerous examples at Southampton. The answer is not to send these players to a new League 3, risking the robust health of the lower divisions. The answer is to put them into the first teams in the Premier League. It has happened right in front of Dyke’s eyes this season and yet somehow it seems to have passed him by. Outstanding: Ross Barkley has enjoyed an excellent season with Everton and has subsequently been called up to the England squad for the World Cup . Class: Arsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, seen here taking on the Bayern Munich defence, has also impressed in a number of matches . Controversial: Greg Dyke's plans to introduce a League 3 between the Football League and the Conference to help foster young English talent was met with widespread criticism . Wickham scored the winning goal for England Under 17s to win the European Championship in 2010 and he was excellent throughout the whole tournament. In the course of our conversation, Wickham told me he was surprised that more players from that England squad in 2010 hadn’t made the breakthrough. Last season only Wickham (at the end of the season), Barkley and West Brom’s Saido Berahino played regularly in the Premier League. Others from that squad have talent and should make the breakthrough next season after serving their time on loan at a lower level: West Brom’s George Thorne is a superb passer of the ball; it’s about time we saw Jack Butland in regular action in the top flight; and I am certain that had Josh McEachran come through at Liverpool or Arsenal he would be a first team regular by now. The current England Under 17s have made the final again this year – superb goals from Chelsea’s Dominic Solanke and Fulham’s Patrick Roberts won the semi against Portugal. Bright young thing: Chelsea's Dominic Solanke scored a delightful chip against Portugal as England reached the final of the European Under-17 Championship . Individual brilliance: Patrick Roberts celebrates after doubling England's lead in the semi-final match in Malta . And the England Under 21s controlled the ball superbly against Wales with Nathan Redmond starring, as he has for Norwich for most of the season. Clubs like Chelsea need a change in mentality which I think the fans would welcome – watching their most talented teenager Ruben Loftus-Cheek in recent weeks, it’s clear he is surely too good to be ignored. I hope Mourinho shows some bravery and picks him. And I sincerely hope the fact that Loftus-Cheek is on course to be a millionaire before he even kicks a ball for Chelsea’s first team doesn’t rob him of the hunger to succeed. Hat-trick hero: Nathan Redmond scored all three goals as England Under 21s beat Wales 3-1 in their latest European Championship qualifier . First team chance? Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek has been outstanding for their Under-21 and youth teams this season . The answer is right in front of Dyke’s eyes – he doesn’t need Danny Mills’ ludicrous ramblings to help with this one. Dispel this appalling stereotype that English players have no technique, enforce a rule making clubs put the better homegrown youngsters in the first team, and sit back and enjoy the results. As Everton have shown with Barkley this season, with the right coaching, the talent will emerge. The talent is there, it needs the right guidance and coaching - and the stage for it to flourish.","English young guns have lit up the Premier League this season .

The famous living room: Viewers who were hoping to see a spin-off chat show in this room will have to pay more than a licence fee to get a better look . On the market for £3.5m, it was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who created the Cenotaph and Britain's elaborate country manor embassy in Washington . The Parkers use their 3.5-acre home, known as The Salutation, as a bed and breakfast, offering one of the most luxurious stays in the county . Padding to-and-from the overflowing drinks cabinet, the couple bark at everything from the news to Nigella, before glugging another vodka spritz. As their popularity grew, there has even been talk of the pair hosting a spin-off chat show on that very sofa. But it appears fans will have to pay a little more than a licence fee to keep the gold-paneled haven in their lives. On the market for £3.5million, the property known as The Salutation was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who created the Cenotaph and Britain's elaborate country manor embassy in Washington.

Initially built as a family's country retreat in 1911, Mr and Mrs Parker transformed it into one of the county's most luxurious hotels. Set within the town and adjacent to the River Stour, surrounded by three-and-a-half acres of garden, the house boasts privacy. Describing the quality of the surroundings, their website says: 'Like a fine claret leaving you with a rounded after-taste, our rooms are tailored for the connoiseur.' The property comprises a main house, a secondary house, a coach house, gardener's cottage, and gate house . Demand is soaring for the Sandwich property, which boasts marble kitchen tops and cream-painted walls . The estate was initially built as a country retreat for one family in 1911, but the Parkers have opened their doors, and gained an extensive fan base .

Gertrude Jekyll, a famed horticulturist who formed the other half of a dream team with Lutyens, was called in to help with the gardens - which the Parkers have dubbed the Secret Gardens of Sandwich. The couple, who met and married in 1998, have two young children and a sausage dog called Gigi. They bought The Salutation in 2004. Both worked in property management before joining forces. Born in Canterbury, Dom Parker, 50, went to agriculture college before setting up his own holiday cottage company in New Forest in the 1980s. In 1991, he moved back to Canterbury to join the family steel business, but continued to harbour an interest in properties. Mr Parker told the Kent Messenger: . 'Our lives are changing.

The grade II listed 11-bedroom property in St Albans, Hertfordshire, was once the home of Lady Katherine Ferrers – also known as the ‘Wicked Lady’ – who led a secret life as a highwaywoman. The stately home, which dates back to a monk from St Albans who formed a hermitage in the early 1100s, still has many of its original features, including a Jacobean oak staircase and stone Tudor fireplace. The 12th century manor house, which comes complete with a secret passageway and which was once home to English aristocrat and heiress Lady Katherine Ferrers, has gone on the market for £4.25million . The 11-bedroom property in St Albans, Hertfordshire, was once the home of Lady Ferrers - also known as the 'Wicked Lady' - who led a secret life as a highwaywoman . The stately home, which dates back to a monk from St Albans who formed a hermitage in the early 1100s, still has many of its original features, including a Jacobean oak staircase and stone Tudor fireplace . However, it’s most intriguing feature is a secret passageway behind the fireplace which leads into a secret chamber. It is rumoured that - bored by her husband, Sir Thomas Fanshaw, Lady Katherine would climb down through the hidden partition at night and creep down secret stairs in the chamber which led out onto the grounds. She is then said to have donned breeches, a cloak, mask and tricorn hat before climing onto a black horse, which would be waiting for her. After setting off for Watling Street, which is now the busy A5 which runs past the house on its way north from London, she would carry out midnight robberies on unsuspecting travellers. The tale of ‘Wicked Lady Ferrers’ - as she ultimately became known – is so intriguing it has even been the subject of two films and a novel. The property, which is set in the heart of the estate's 79 acres of land, has been passed on to an array of different families throughout the generations but is now up for sale with Savills Estate Agents for £4.25m . The Elizabethan brick mansion features five reception rooms, 11 bedrooms, four bathrooms with two additional shower rooms, a large kitchen and a games room (pictured), as well as formal gardens and a separate quarter for staff . Julian David, an associate at Savills, said: 'It's a lasting piece of British architecture. It's steeped in so much history.

It is on the market with Savills Estate Agents with a guide price of £4.25million, although offers of £4million are being considered. Julian David, an associate at Savills, said: ‘It’s a lasting piece of British architecture. It’s steeped in so much history. 'It’s a fabulous piece of English architecture and there’s a lot of history surrounding it. ‘It’s set in fabulous grounds and is ideal for someone who wants something quintessentially British.’ The property was in the ownership of the Ferrers family for several decades until the death of its most famous inhabitant Katherine - The Wicked Lady - Ferrers (above) Cell Park mansion, formerly known as Markyate Cell, was built in the early 1100s by a monk from St Albans, Hertfordshire, who formed a hermitage at the mansion. In 1145, Abbot Geoffrey, also of St Albans, took over the estate when he founded a Benedictine priory at the property. Markyate Cell remained a priory for the next four centuries until confiscated by the Crown in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536. In 1539, a 21-year lease was granted to Humphrey Bourchier, who converted the monastery into a stately manor house. Many of the original features from this era, including a Jacobean oak staircase and stone Tudor fireplaces, still remain. In 1547, Edward VI granted the estate to George Ferrers, Lord of the Manor of Flamstead, and the property remained in the ownership of the Ferrers family until the death of its most famous inhabitant Katherine - The Wicked Lady – Ferrers. It was rumoured that Katherine would leave the house in the guise of a highwayman and rob passengers on Watling Street (now the A5). According to popular legend, Lady Katherine committed highway robberies with her accomplice and purported lover, Ralph Chaplin. She also stole from her husband Sir Thomas Fanshaw’s dinner guests by using a secret passageway at the property – which remains hidden behind the Tudor fireplace to this day. In 1660, aged just 26, Lady Katherine died. Although the circumstances surrounding her death have never been confirmed, it is widely thought she was shot during one of her robberies on Nomansland Common in Wheathamstead. As the legend goes, she died of her wounds while trying to ride back to the secret staircase entry at Markyate Cell. Her body was supposedly discovered wearing men's clothing before her servants recovered it and carried her home to be buried. Following her death, Thomas Coppin then purchased Cell Park and it remained in his family until 1805 when it was sold to Joseph Howell. On his death in 1825, Daniel Goodson Adey bought the property and Markyate Cell stayed in his family until 1910. Under his ownership, the house was largely rebuilt in 1825-6 by Robert Lugar to incorporate the remains of the mansion built in 1539-40 and the original priory of 1145. In 1910, the new owner, Mr MacLeod, set about redesigning the gardens and a major part of this design remains today. In 1916, the estate passed into the hands of Sir Thomas Beecham and two years later it was sold to Sir John Pennefather. Since Pennefather's ownership in 1918, it has had a number of different occupants and in 1984 it became known as Cell Park.","The grade II listed property in St Albans, Hertfordshire, has five reception rooms, 11 bedrooms and four bathrooms .

The Korean firm is said to have sent early prototypes to developers to test, and the final product could launch by the end of the year. Sources close to Samsung told Engadget the headsets have OLED screens and will connect with the next generation of Galaxy devices. Samsung could be about to enter the virtual reality race, if reports about an upcoming headset are true. The Korean firm is said to have sent early prototypes to developers to test, and the final product could launch by the end of the year. It would rival Sony's Project Morpheus headset, pictured . In October, Samsung filed a design patent for wearable computer glasses that are tethered to a smartphone. According to the files, Samsung's spectacles plug into a mobile phone and display information such as text messages and phone calls. Unlike Google Glass, which is wireless, Samsung’s design will be attached using a micro-USB connection. This could potentially boost battery life. The design also integrates ear phones into the frame, so users won’t need separate buds to listen to music. The reports suggest the headset will run on Android, rather than the Tizen operating system most recently seen on Samsung’s latest smartwatches. Engadget added the headset is also likely to connect to a phone or tablet using wires, to prevent a lag when playing games. The release date, price and other features were not revealed, but it does differ from the rumoured Galaxy Glass project, first reported on in October. Variations of virtual reality have been around for years, particularly in flight and driving simulators, but it's popularity has risen recently due to companies such as Oculus VR. Its Oculus Rift headset began life as a Kickstarter project and was bought by Facebook earlier this year in a deal said to be worth around $2 billion. A consumer version is expected later this year.

"By . Martin Robinson . This is the moment a British woman who witnessed 9/11 broke down when she saw her description of how people had to jump from the Twin Towers had been adopted by the new museum dedicated to victims. Louisa Griffith-Jones, 47, was living in New York in 2001 and refused to turn away as the two hijacked jets destroyed the World Trade Center, killing almost 3,000 people. Miss Griffith-Jones, who now lives in Norwich, decided to return to the city to visit the newly-opened 9/11 Memorial Museum and found a powerful quote she gave is etched into its wall. Scroll down for video . Emotional: This is the moment Louisa Griffith-Jones, a British woman who witnessed 9/11, realised her description of the terror attack was used by the new New York museum . The display was part of a section devoted to telling the stories of terrified staff and visitors who jumped to their death from around 1,400ft. The inscription reads: 'You felt compelled to watch out of respect to them. 'They were ending their life without a choice and to turn away from them would have been wrong.' Miss Griffith-Jones, who lived and worked just two blocks away from the Twin Towers, said: 'It means so much to know I have helped preserve their memory and honour them. 'I didn't know the quote was going to be there and to see it carved into the wall was a sad and emotional moment. 'I felt strongly that they not should be forgotten or ignored. 'Watching them was horrific and that part of the day has taken me the longest to come to terms with.' Ordeal: Miss Griffith-Jones said: 'They were ending their life without a choice and to turn away from them would have been wrong' as she watched people jump from the Twin Towers . She also left a vivid 10,000-word audio account of her experiences - and without her knowledge the inscription is taken from that. A purple pair of flip-flops she wore on the day, which had a piece of one of the towers embedded in them, is also part of a museum display. The devastating attacks - along with the crashing of two more aircraft, into the Pentagon, in Washington DC, and a field in Pennsylvania - killed nearly 3,000 people. More than 1,100 people have never been identified, and their remains have been placed in a tomb under the new museum. At the time Miss Griffith-Jones was part of a production team working on the Animal Precinct programme with the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA). Never forget: President Obama dedicated the new museum last week. Pictured above looking a pictures of the dead with former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg . Emotional: The impressive museum features Ladder three Fire Truck as well as scores of other items from 9/11 . She was engulfed by dust and debris as the shattered towers crashed to the ground. The new museum, which features thousands of artefacts from the atrocity, opened this month. Miss Griffith-Jones , who runs a public relations and communications consultancy, was invited to view it before it opened to the public. 'In the beginning there were lots of tears but the museum was so respectful and honest about 9/11,' she said. The trip was made possible thanks to her friends, who wrote to Virgin Atlantic asking for help with the cost of the flights. No day shall erase you from the memory of time: The letters of the quotation from Virgil's Aeneid were forged out of remnant World Trade Center steel by New Mexico blacksmith Tom Joyce . The airline generously slashed the cost while her friends also helped her out. 'I'm so, so grateful to the friends who clubbed together for me to go there. 'I'm so glad I got to go during the dedication period as I don't think I could go and stand next to tourists whose experience would be very different to mine,' said Louisa. 'I went to the toilet at one point and that seemed to be where people went to cry and hug in private, away from the main public spaces. 'There was a mutual respect between everybody when we looked at each other because we had all had that experience.' In honor of the first responders: Captain Patrick John Brown's helmet from the FDNY on display in the museum - but some critics have turned on management for 'crass' decisions made about a gift shop and new restaurant . The 9/11 . museum has faced major criticism since it opened last week. Most recently it was accused of crass commercialism after it was revealed that the memorial site will . house a 80-seat restaurant. The .

A portion of proceeds from the . restaurant are going back to the museum but Mr Meyer has was forced to deny the location was inappropriate. According . to reports, some first responders, who were supposed to be able to tour . the museum for free prior to its official Wednesday opening, were turned . away due to party preparations. 'They . were drinking, eating and laughing when this is pretty much a . grave-site,' a National September 11 Memorial & Museum employee, who . asked not to be named, told the New York Daily News of the 60 or so . partygoers.

"By . John Mcgarry . Armchair viewers are set for a TV bonanza next season after Hibs’ relegation added further spice to the Championship. The Easter Road club’s humiliating defeat on penalties to Hamilton confirmed they will fight it out with Hearts and Rangers in the second tier for the one automatic promotion place on offer. And, in light of Sunday’s drama, Sportsmail understands that several TV companies are now vying for the right to screen additional matches from what promises to be Scotland’s most competitive division. Dejected: Hibernian were relegated after the club's heartbreaking play-off defeat to Hamilton . As things stand, Sky are in line to screen five Rangers games next term with BT Sport contracted to show 10 matches featuring the Ibrox club. However, with the added interest from the two capital clubs now confirmed, it’s believed BBC Alba have already kicked off talks about the prospect of showing 16 further matches – not involving Rangers. If that deal is rubberstamped, Alba would utilise the Friday night slot already dusted down by their satellite rivals as well as showing games on weekends both live and on delayed transmission. That proposed deal would restrict the broadcaster to just two games per ground. Keen to maximise revenue streams however, the SPFL have left the door open for Sky and BT Sport to come in and possibly extend their coverage of the second tier. That could lead to a bun-fight between the three companies but, regardless of who wins the day, it seems certain that over 30 second tier matches will be beamed into living rooms in 2014-15. Promoted: Rangers' midfielder Lee McCulloch lifts the League One trophy in April . On Monday night an SPFL spokesman said: 'We have regular conversations with our broadcast partners which are commercially confidential – we expect to announce the broadcasting arrangements for season 2014/15 in conjunction with them in the coming weeks.' The lower league deals were first thrashed out when Rangers were exiled in the bottom tier in 2012 – initially with Sky and ESPN – but the fact three giant of the Scottish game are now in the Championship is forcing a rethink. Last season Alba showed three live games and a further 35 on delayed transmission.","Hibernian, Rangers and Hearts will all play in the Scottish Championship next season .

'Tony Strickland was a founding member of the NRA Member Council and former California Rifle and Pistol Association legislator of the year. 'Tony has been a longtime supporter of the rights of citizens to keep and bear arms and will continue to oppose, and actively fight, any legislation that would take away our Second Amendment right to bear arms. 'As the founder of the Freedom Firearms Coalition and with a lifetime ""A"" rating from the NRA, we can count on Tony Strickland to protect our constitutional rights. 'On June 3rd, vote for Tony Strickland for Congress. This call was paid for by Strickland for Congress.' On Friday night UC Santa Barbara 'virgin killer' Elliot  Rodger stabbed his two roommates and another student to death, and then shot and killed two sorority girls and a male student. A California political media buyer told MailOnline that most robocall vendors can cancel campaigns at any time, at the potential cost of the full value of the campaign. Strickland 'may have decided that he had more to lose by canceling than he did by going ahead with it,' the ad-woman said, requesting anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the subject matter – and because she works for other Republican candidates statewide. 'But just one phone call – ironic, huh? – could have prevented this.' Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation, said Strickland's robocall should be considered in light of the anti-gun rhetoric that leapt to the forefront immediately after the shooting. 'Considering that those in favor of gun prohibition immediately started calling for new restrictions on Second Amendment firearms rights,' he told MailOnline, 'I bet that the calls will not hurt his campaign.' The National Rifle Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment made on the Memorial Day holiday. The organization's previous campaigns, however, indicate that it would argue in favor of a more heavily armed citizenry in order to create a disincentive for future mass-murderers. But Richard Martinez,whose son Chris was among Rodger's victims, said Saturday that he blamed, 'craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA,' for his son's death. 'They talk about gun rights. What about Chris’s right to live?' a visibly anguished Martinez cried . 'When will this insanity stop? When will enough people say, ""Stop this madness! we don’t have to live like this!""? 'Too many have died. We should say to ourselves: ""Not one more"".' When police found his body, Rodger was surrounded by three semi-automatic handguns and nearly 400 rounds of ammunition, which had all been purchased legally. 'The timing could hardly be more tasteless,' wrote blogger Mike Devlin, who first surfaced a recording of the robocall at SantaClarita.com. Strickland hasn't spoken publicly about the shooting, and his robocall may ensure that he doesn't . KILLER: British-born student Elliot Rodger, 22,  son of Hunger Games film director Peter Rodger, murdered six people Friday night in the Isla Vista district of Santa Barbara, California . The Santa Barbara County Sheriff's office showed reporters photos of the Glock and Sig Sauer handguns that Rodger had with him on Friday night . 'Tony . Strickland actually represented Santa Barbara and Isla Vista in the . State Senate until late 2012,' he wrote, 'and many of these victims were . likely [his] former constituents.' Devlin is a part-time editor at the urban-culture website RapGenius.com. Strickland is running for Congress on an anti-Obama platform that includes opposition to the Affordable Care Act – he called it 'fundamentally flawed' in one debate – and the promise of a federal balanced budget amendment. He also favors the Keystone XL pipeline, calling it one way to make America 'energy independent.' Strickland is part of an eight-way race for the seat held by the retiring Republican Rep. Buck McKeon in California's 25th District. The June 3 'open primary' ballot will include four Republicans, two Democrats, one Libertarian and an independent candidate, all vying for the top two slots and a November runoff. Strickland previously ran for Congress in California's redrawn 26th District, but lost to Democratic Rep. Julia Brownley in 2012.","Tony Strickland is a US House candidate near the congressional district where a mass shooting occurred Friday night at UC Santa Barbara .

"By . Rupert Steiner . He is without doubt the most fashionable bunny in Britain – and his antics are followed by thousands on social media. But supermodel Cara Delevingne’s pet rabbit Cecil almost came to an unfortunate end last week after he was let loose in the offices of Mulberry, home of the designer handbag. Miss Delevingne released Cecil, giving him free rein of the room, while she sat at a table with executives before a photo shoot. Cara Delevingne, with her pet rabbit Cecil, which has a lucky escape at Mulberry HQ last week . A source said: ‘He was happily eating the celery out of the Bloody Marys and just hanging with everyone. ‘He was hopping around into everyone’s lap and then Cara put him down on the floor so she could take a few pictures. It was then that he saw his moment.’ Cecil is said to have spotted an air-conditioning pipe poking out of the floor. ‘Before anyone could do anything he had launched his back paws and scuttled over to it,’ the source said. ‘The last thing anyone saw was the disappearing tail. He didn’t get very far because he got stuck under the floor.’ Cara strokes the rabbit, which is sitting in the crook of her arm, as she walks down the street . Horrified staff called for the urgent assistance of maintenance men, who were forced to remove a number of floor vents so the pet could be rescued – much to Miss Delevingne’s relief. The 21-year-old supermodel, who has posed for Burberry, Mulberry and Chanel, is known for her rather eccentric habits. Lately these have included carting Cecil to meetings in a bunny box. She introduced ‘Cecil Bunny Delevingne’ to the world last Wednesday. He has since been photographed with his famous ‘aunties’ – her sister Poppy Delevingne as well as her friend, the singer Rita Ora. He has also been pictured frolicking around the streets of London, sitting in front of a computer keyboard and showing off his taste for Chanel. Cara locks her pet rabbit Cecil in his cage. On May 14, she sent a tweet that said 'Meet my new bunny @cecildelevingne' The supermodel and her famous friends are known for their obsession with social media. Cara has 5.38million followers on the photo-sharing website Instagram. On May 14, she sent a tweet that said ‘Meet my new bunny @cecildelevingne.’ He has also been pictured frolicking around the streets of London, sitting in front of a Mac keyboard and showing off his taste for Chanel. At the Cannes film festival last week Miss Delevigne - who is also an aspiring actress - arrived at the De Grisogono dinner party at Hotel du Cap-Eden Roc, in a Roberto Cavalli dress showing off a new intricate tattoo on the back of her neck. She made her debut as Princess Sorokina in Anna Karenina in 2012, and has already starred in three films which are due for release in 2014 - Kids in Love, London Fields and The Face of an Angel. After the Mulberry meeting Delevingne went on to a rehearsal for sister Poppy’s wedding at St Paul’s Church in Knightsbridge, London which took place later that week. Tweeting celebrity pets do not have a good track record in terms of their own mortality. Cecil’s dash for freedom had similarities with the sad passing of Alan, the in-house dachshund of magazine Tatler in central London. Last year it had become distracted by a passing jogger and make a dash for it, through a revolving door, but sadly, it didn’t make it through to the other side. This despite the best efforts of two fire engines and 10 firemen.","Cara Delevingne took rabbit Cecil to offices of handbag designer Mulberry .

"By . Simon Peach . Lukasz Fabianski admits the FA Cup final was probably his last match for Arsenal but could think of no better way to end his time with the club. The Poland goalkeeper has spent much of his time since arriving from Legia Warsaw in 2007 watching from the sidelines. Fabianski, now 29, has understandably grown frustrated at playing second fiddle and is set to leave at the end of his contract this summer, having rejected offers of an extension. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsenal's open top bus parade . What a way to go! Lukasz Fabianski signed off in style for Arsenal with Saturday's FA Cup final victory . The last of his 78 matches for the Gunners came on Saturday, when Arsene Wenger plumped for the FA Cup ever-present instead of regular number one Wojciech Szczesny at Wembley. It was a decision the Frenchman may well have been cursing as Hull scored twice early on in the FA Cup final, although it was all smiles in the end as Aaron Ramsey struck in stoppage time to secure a 3-2 extra-time win and end Arsenal's nine-year trophy drought. 'It feels great, it feels amazing,' Fabianski said. 'I don't know how best to express my emotions but it feels amazing. 'It was probably my last game for Arsenal. I don't know what I can say, but if I end my Arsenal career in that way then it is the best way to finish. 'It is a massive relief because it has been a long time without a trophy, especially after that kind of game when we were 2-0 down in the cup final. 'No-one was expecting us to be two goals down after 10 minutes and to produce that great comeback I think was a massive, massive relief. Safe pair of hands: Fabianski has been kept out of the side by No 1 goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny . 'Hopefully the club can now kick on. I think this gives us or gives Arsenal the idea that those players can win trophies, that they are able to.' Fabianksi may be joined by right-back Bacary Sagna in leaving the club this summer, although unlike the goalkeeper the France right-back was unwilling to speak after the final. However, even with those potential departures Wenger will be hopeful that Arsenal's first silverware since the 2005 FA Cup can act as a catalyst to further success. Lukas Podolski did not have his greatest game in Saturday's triumph but has been a key member of the squad this season and knows just how important the victory against Hull was. 'You win nothing for nine years so it is special for us,' the Germany international said. 'We have to come and celebrate now. All smiles: Aaron Ramsey (centre) notched an extra-time winner for the Gunners against Hull City . 'For the fans, for the club, it is something special. You wait and wait for nine years and some people repeatedly said ""Arsenal win nothing, Arsenal win nothing"". 'It is a lot of pressure but in the end it is a cup game and, in the end, it can happen. We were 2-0 down and came back, it was a great match and we had the cup in our hands. 'We have a great spirit in the team. Everybody is a part of this and you see in the last matches we did well, getting fourth place and now winning the FA Cup. 'It was a special cup game because Hull fought great and played great but in the end we have it.'","Polish goalkeeper is set to leave the Emirates Stadium .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Belgium's famous exports include beer and chocolate but did you also know they gave the world the Smurfs? With the recent release of two Smurf . movies attracting a new generation of fans to the franchise, the Belgian . tourist board are hoping they can capitalise on the love of the dwarves . to bring new visitors to their country. The lovable blue characters were the invention of Belgian cartoonist Pierre Culliford, aka Peyo, who first drew them for a cartoon strip in 1958. Proud: The Belgians pay homage to the Smurfs with this statue and the Museum Of Original Figurines in Brussels . Global stars: But the little blue dwarves were first famous in Belgium . The late cartoonist 'Peyo' with the characters he created: Memorabilia similar to that he's surrounded by can be bought in Brussel's Smurf Store . His comic strips and albums quickly . became a hit in his native country and have since been translated into more than 30 different languages. When Hanna Barbera turned the . comics into a TV cartoon series in the Eighties the Smurfs found even more global fame - . so much so that many people are unaware of their European origins. Marc Marghem, a tour guide at the Belgian Comic Strip Centre in Brussels - that has a whole section dedicated to the Smurfs - told MailOnline: 'The Smurfs have become so famous internationally that many people don't know where they are from. But they are definitely Belgians!' The proud Belgians have never forgotten that the Smurfs are their own and the characters are celebrated in a number of venues across their capital of Brussels. Still going strong: The Smurfs began as a cartoon strip in 1958, left. Now a new generation are fans thanks to the films using voices including Katy Perry's as Smurfette . In time for release of The Smurfs 2 on DVD and Blu-ray this month, from 20 December to 9 February the city will host the International Festival of Ice Sculptures for the first time, in the sumptuous setting of the Place des Palais. Four hundred and twenty tonnes of natural ice will be transformed to recreate the world of the Smurfs and other children's favourites. And while the Smurfs are only meant to be 'three apples high', the ice sculptures will be up to six metres tall. Away from the ice sculptures, Femail discovered there are other places where children (and big kids!) can immerse themselves in the world of the Smurfs while in Brussels. As well as the aforementioned Comic Strip Centre, there's the Museum Of Original Figurines (MOOF) and the world's only Smurf store where fans can buy everything from Smurf-related books and figurines to T-shirts and mugs. At the MOOF Museum, there's a display . showing how the Smurfs went from a humble cartoon strip to Hollywood . with today's big budget 3D films using the voice talents of stars . including Katy Perry. Sea of blue: The Moof has a display of Smurfs from giant statues to a model village . Museum exhibits: The figurines have become collectors' items and many are on show in the country's capital . Children . can also marvel at the Smurf model village there and meet giant . versions of their heroes. Both MOOF and the Comic Strip Centre detail . how the Smurfs came to be with Peyo conceiving 99 Smurf characters - all . male - with different personality traits and then adding a token . female, Smurfette. Feminists . have slated the creator in the past for his lack of female characters . and the MOOF reveals that the decision didn't go down well with his wife . either. It reveals: 'The . way Peyo introduced the Smurfs caused a lot of resentment between him . and his wife. The Smurfette was created by Gargamel, the villain, as a . blend of the following 10 ingredients: 'a spark of coquetry, a large . dose of prejudice, three tears of a crocodile, the brains of a shrimp, . the tongue of a vampire, a little bit of wickedness, a handful of anger, . a little bit of lies, deep fondness for sweets, a little bit of bad . faith, a little bit of unpredictability, a streak of pride, a cup of . envy, some sensitivity, a part of foolishness, a part of cunning, a . handful of moodiness, two cups of stubbornness and an excess of waste.' Matt . Murray, author of the book The World of Smurfs: A Celebration of Tiny . Blue Proportions, said the sexism is down to the Smurfs being a product . of their time. He told The Atlantic: 'Let's face it, it's in the . Sixties. Anyone who has seen an episode of Mad Men, or actually lived . through the early-to-mid-'60s, knows that it wasn't exactly the best . time to be a woman. And we're also talking about Belgium, and the whole . Jacques Brel culture of celebrating your love through misery.' There have been small attempts to redress the balance with Hanna . Barbera adding some extra female Smurfs while the most recent film, The . Smurfs 2, has a new female character voiced by Christina Ricci. Smurf world: The store has everything from figurines to towels, books and rucksacks . There's only one Smurfette: The other original 99 characters are male . Both the MOOF, the Comic Strip Centre and the Smurf store show how the characters have become a global phenomenon and their popularity has endured despite their apparent sexism and lack of modernism. They have even been able to transcend the death of Peyo in 1992 with the latest films creating original storylines for a new audience. But Mr Marghem explains that comics like the Smurfs aren't just a means of entertaining children in Belgium. They also serve to educate by teaching them about historical and topical events. For example in the Smurfs, the story King Smurf - where one of the Smurfs proclaims themselves King - aims to teach children about democracy and the dangers of dictatorships. Meanwhile the story Smurfs Versus Smurfs was based on Belgian politics and the turmoil caused by their Dutch and French divide. The Comic Strip Centre also aims to celebrate cartoon strips as the '9th art form' and encourage children to be creative and draw their own characters as well as reading about them. The Comic Strip Centre, pictured, is popular with children (and grown up Smurf fans): It's a place where they're encouraged to read and be creative . British children visiting the museums can learn more than just about cartoons thanks to the Smurfs first being written in Dutch and French. The cartoon displays give them the opportunity to learn the languages in a visual and easy to understand way. And it's not just the Smurfs who cartoon fans can see when visiting the region. Belgium also gave the world another comic hero whose adventures have stood the test of time - Tintin. There are displays dedicated to him at the MOOF and Comic Strip museums as well as other characters created by Belgian artists such as Asterix and Blake and Mortimer. They will all be included in the Brussels Ice Magic display. Families keen to see the ice sculptures before they melt away in February can take advantage of the fact Eurostar operates from London St Pancras to Brussels with the direct journey taking just two hours. Return fares cost from £69 if booked in advance. Art nouveau masterpiece: The Comic Book Centre is homed in an impressive building designed by Victor Horta in 1905 . A visit to learn about the Smurfs in the . festive season also provides an opportunity to visit the city's Christmas . market including a fun fair and see the famous nativity scene in . the Grand Place that includes live animals. The museums mentioned above are year round attractions and children can also do a comic book trail of the city, a kind of treasure hunt to find giant murals of cartoon characters that have been drawn on buildings around Brussels. They can even have lunch surrounded by their favourite characters at the Comic Cafe in Grand Sablon which includes memorabilia from the Smurfs, as well as Disney and other global animators. Accompanying adults are likely to be fans of the Smurfs themselves having also grown up with the cartoons. But if not, the architecture of the Comic Strip Centre is likely to wow them if the content doesn't. It was designed by Belgium's most famous architect, Victor Horta in 1905 as a textile factory in an art nouveau style. The building was nearly destroyed - like some of Horta's other work - when art nouveau went out of fashion in the mid 20th century but was saved thanks to it becoming the home of the comics. The use of glass in the ceiling and floor tiles coupled with the mosaic floor makes it a light and airy space to display exhibits. And if the Smurf sightseeing all gets too much, parents can unwind after the exhibition visits with another Belgian speciality - beer.

"By . Paul Bentley . Children as young as ten are being arrested on suspicion of rape amid fears that online pornography is twisting their view of sex and relationships. The scale of sexual offences committed by primary school children was revealed in disturbing figures from police forces across the country. Twenty-four forces arrested children under 13 for suspected rape in the past year while seven detained at least one ten year old. Surfing the web: Twenty-four forces arrested children under 13 for suspected rape in the past year (file picture) The figures, obtained by the Daily Mail under a Freedom of Information request, highlight growing concerns at the influence of online pornography on impressionable young minds. Yesterday NSPCC spokesman Jon Brown said there was ‘undoubtedly’ a link between children carrying out sexual assaults and easy access to online pornography, which gives them a ‘distorted picture of what sexual relationships should be about’. John Carr, from the Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety, said: ‘There is already a widespread feeling that the internet is playing an unhealthy part in the early sexualisation of children and these revelations about the arrests of ten-year-olds for rape will add fuel to the flames.’ The Prime Minister has promised to toughen controls on internet pornography by offering a series of optional filters whenever a customer buys a new computer or signs up to a new provider. But the Mail has called for much stricter controls which would see an automatic pornography block, with users having to ‘opt in’ to view adult material. The figures were uncovered in a survey of all 52 police forces across Britain. Proposals: Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to toughen controls on internet pornography by offering a series of optional filters whenever a customer buys a new computer or signs up to a new provider . Of the 39 that responded, 31 forces had arrested children between the ages of ten and 13 on suspicion of rape in the past year. A boy of 12 raped a nine-year-old neighbour because he wanted to ‘feel grown up’ after watching hardcore porn online. With unrestricted access to the internet, the schoolboy, now 14, looked at explicit sites before taking the girl to a garden shed and copying what he had watched. The shocking case, on the Isle of Skye, came to light because the girl started to feel ill and told her mother that she was scared she had a ‘baby in my tummy’. The High Court in Edinburgh heard earlier this year how the boy repeatedly attacked the girl between December 1, 2010, and January 31, 2011. He also abused her in his bedroom while a 12-year-old friend watched. The boy later confessed to police and showed them the hardcore sites he had seen online. Asked why he copied them, he said it was because of ‘temptation’ and ‘to feel grown up’. He was placed in a secure unit after pleading guilty to one charge of rape and two of sexual assault. He will be closely supervised by social workers until the age of 18. Seven said the youngest child . arrested for rape was aged just ten while six said the youngest was 11, . and 11 forces said the youngest suspect was 12. Forces reported only the age of the . youngest child they had arrested for the crime, meaning the actual . number of very young children detained in each age group could be much . higher. According to the figures, 357 children aged 18 and under were found guilty of a range of sex crimes including rape, sexual assaults on other children, grooming, incest and taking or possessing indecent photographs of minors. The NSPCC’s Mr Brown said pornography was a powerful influence on this generation of children. ‘Some young people do not have an understanding of consent – if they want something they will go out to get it, whatever the consequences,’ he said. ‘There is a definite link between this and watching hardcore porn. It is an issue of entitlement. If a child has watched a rape scene the same child might attempt to act that piece of behaviour out. The children talk about acting out what they have watched.’ One child abuse investigator said the easy availability of pornography was changing children’s behaviour. The civilian investigator, who works for a South East England force, said: ‘When we arrest juveniles for sex crimes we increasingly find they have accessed hardcore pornography. ‘This is often on their phones where . they store videos and pictures to share with their friends. It is not . something my colleagues would have dealt with ten years ago.’ In one case in Merseyside, a ten-year-old boy was involved in the suspected gang rape by three boys of a 12-year-old girl in a public park. Avon and Somerset police also arrested a ten-year-old ‘alleged to have forced a friend to perform a sex act on several occasions’. Police in Essex, Derbyshire, Durham, Gwent, and Strathclyde also arrested ten-year-olds on suspicion of rape in 2011. The Daily Mail’s campaign for an ‘opt in’ system on internet pornography is supported by the Deputy Children’s Commissioner Sue Berelowitz. Earlier this year, Mrs Berelowitz told MPs that online porn is turning children into sex attackers. ‘They have watched things and then they’ve enacted them,’ she said. ‘It has definitely affected children’s thresholds of what they think is normal.’","Scale of sexual offences committed by primary school children revealed .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . The wife of ailing radio personality Casey Kasem was served Friday with a California court order that temporarily suspends her powers to determine her husband's medical care amid concerns about his health and welfare. The order Kitsap County sheriff's deputies said they delivered also expands daughter Kerri Kasem's authority to determine whether her father, who's now in Washington state, is receiving adequate medical care. Wife Jean Kasem said in an interview aired Friday evening that her husband is getting the best possible care and she is 'not going to allow anybody to shred (her) family on unfounded facts and malicious accusations' of elder abuse. Stripped: Jean Kasem has been stripped of guardianship over her husband, radio icon Casey Kasem . Victory: Kerri Kasem, Casey's daughter from another marriage, is fighting Jean over guardianship over her father . In a video statement provided to King5.com, Jean Kasem says her step-daughter Kerri's legal maneuverings to gain control over her father are motivated by nothing more than money. She says that the rift Kasem has with his daughter from another marriage is based on her participation in the Church of Scientology. 'Casey never agreed with his eldest daughter's - from a prior marriage of over 40 years ago - involvement with the Church of Scientology and does not want her involved in his medical or estate affairs,' Jean Kasem says in her televised statement. 'If the judge in these highly suspicious preceedings does not see the monetary motive behind these fraudulent petitioners, then something is seriously wrong and unjust here,' she continued. 'The abuse of the legal process has been seriously violated and should be looked into by the appropriate judicial committee immediately without any further delay.' Jean Kasem says she has proof that several law enforcement agencies that have checked in on her ailing husband have all said that he seems alert and in good spirits. Casey and Jean Kasem have been married for more than 30 years, and Jean claims his children from his previous marriage are making fraudulent claims about how she cares for him . 'My husband is very happy and comfortable in our family and has told me time and time again that he wishes to remain under my care,' she said in an interview with KING-TV. Kerri Kasem's spokesman Danny Deraney did not have an immediate comment on the service of the court order in Washington. He did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment on statements by Jean Kasem. On Tuesday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel S. Murphy ordered Jean Kasem to comply with court orders allowing doctors to evaluate her husband, and also allow his daughter Kerri to see him. He also ordered Jean Kasem to surrender her husband's passport and temporarily suspended her powers to determine her husband's medical care. In mid-May, Murphy had expressed concerns about Kasem's whereabouts and safety amid a dispute between his wife and children from another marriage. The sheriff's office in Kitsap County, west of Seattle, tracked him down the next day. The Church: Jean Ksaem says Kerri's involvement with the Church of Scientology is why Casey doesn't want her involved in his medical decisions . Sheriff's Deputy Scott Wilson said officers who performed a welfare check May 13 on the 82-year-old Kasem found him staying at the home of long-time family friends. Kasem 'appeared to be not in distress,' Wilson said Friday. 'He couldn't speak but he appeared to us to be cognizant of what was going on around him and who people were.' The sheriff's spokesman said medications were present and those at the home, including Jean Kasem, said appropriate medical care was being provided. Medical professionals, including doctors and visiting nurses have been 'attending him as required,' Wilson said. Kerri Kasem's court filings state her father is suffering from a form of dementia called Lewy Body Disease. Fraud: Jean claims all of Kerri Kasem's claims of elder abuse against her husband are fraudulent and motivated by greed . The sheriff's spokesman noted that the officers who delivered the court order were 'basically the messengers between the courts in California' and Kasem's connections in Washington. 'We wouldn't enforce anything until we were directed by the Washington court and coordinated with our prosecutor's office,' Wilson said. 'That hasn't happened.' Kasem gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, 'American Top 40' and 'Casey's Top 40,' and he was the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon 'Scooby Doo.'","Jean Kasem was served Friday with court papers stripping her of guardianship of the aging radio star .

"By . Matt West . A British couple who say they were charged for an extra paella while on holiday ended up in a Spanish prison cell after complaining. Geoff Cox and his partner Bridget Keyes visited a restaurant on their cycling vacation from Cordoba to Granada. They noticed a meal for an extra €15 (£12.70) on their bill and highlighted it with the waiter. But he argued with them and they refused to pay the extra cash. Spanish arrest: Geoff Cox and Bridget Keyes were arrested on holiday in Spain after a row in a restaurant over a £12 paella . After some shoving and pushing police were called and the next day they were told they would have to pay £600 for prosecution costs. After a further altercation, police . officers arrested the couple and later claimed they had been assaulted . and demanded compensation. Mr Cox, who is in his late 50s and from . Newdigate in Surrey, complained to the waiter when the group were . presented with the bill explaining they hadn’t ordered the extra dish, . but the waiter ‘got angry’.

It . got a bit ugly and when he said he would call the police we said, . ‘Right, fine’, because we were certain they would side with us.’ But . when the police arrived the couple were arrested.

A pistol and other possessions belonging to a one-time Old West outlaw who later ran for governor of Oklahoma and also became an actor are going up for auction next month.

Jennings was born in Virginia in 1863 and moved to El Reno, Oklahoma, where he became the prosecuting attorney for Canadian County, according to the Oklahoma Historical Society. Scroll down for video . Al Jennings - pictured here in the Winter of 1913-1914 - was an attorney in Oklahoma Territory who at one time robbed trains. He later became a silent film star. A pistol and other possessions belonging to him are going up for auction next month . Prized possession: The .45 Colt revolver owned by famed outlaw and one-time candidate for Oklahoma governor Alphonzo 'Al' J. Jennings before his death in 1961 will under the hammer in Woodward on June 5 . In 1895, he joined his two brothers in a law practice in Woodward. Later that year, one brother was killed and another wounded in a shootout with a rival attorney. Jennings later formed an outlaw band that attempted to rob trains and general stores before he was captured and sentenced to life in prison. One of his brothers got his sentence reduced, and Jennings was released just a few years later. He ran unsuccessfully for Oklahoma governor in 1914 and then moved to California, where he appeared in at least two westerns before dying in 1961. 'Al Jennings is probably one of the most enigmatic characters in Oklahoma history,' Oklahoma Historical Society executive director Bob Blackburn said. 'He was a potential candidate for governor, so he had a professional side to him — an ambition to be accepted by the community — and at the same time, he had this urge to get rich quick. 'He was not successful at either one.' In 1897 Jennings and joined a gang of bandits and robbed trains, general stores and a post office, with little monetary success. In 1899 he was sentenced to life in prison but, due to the legal efforts of his brother John, the sentence was reduced to five years . Blackburn said Jennings was probably most successful at getting into the movie business. After . Jennings' death, his possessions, including the pistol, trickled down . through family members, who have now decided to put up the items at a . public auction.

"By . Deni Kirkova . The Rodial cream comes in at £150 . A new anti-wrinkle cream is creating a big buzz in the world of cosmetics - because it's made from bee venom. Cosmetic maker Rodial has just launched a new skincare line called Bee Venom, which is clinically proved to halt the damaging effects of the menopause on the face. Experts say that as well as mood swings, sleeplessness and weight-gain, women going through the menopause also suffer a variety of skin problems. Deep wrinkles, puffiness and dryness are just some of the symptoms brought on by hormone changes at this time of life. During the menopause, levels of the female hormones oestrogen and progesterone drop rapidly leading to accelerated skin ageing. Queen Bee: The Royal Family are known fans of skincare infused with active bee venom . Levels of collagen and elastin also go down, leading to saggy skin and deep wrinkles and production of skin-hydrating acids and oils also significantly drop, causing dryness and a 'crepe' appearance to the skin. Studies show that more than half of British women are unaware of the impact the menopause has on their skin. Bee-lieve it: Caroline Flack uses £25 venom cream . In trials involving 14 women aged between 50 and 59, all the volunteers said the bee venom cream improved the texture of their skin, reduced lines and wrinkles and left them appearing 'visibly more youthful'. Honey bee venom is used cosmetically to 'fool' the skin into thinking it has been lightly stung with the toxin melittin. This causes the body to direct blood towards the area and stimulates the production of the naturally-occurring chemicals collagen and elastin. Collagen strengthens body tissue while elastin is the protein that helps the skin to remain taut and bounce back into shape after being pressed or pinched. The venom also has the effect of relaxing the muscles, it is claimed. Experts collect bee venom by placing a pane of glass alongside a hive and running a weak electrical current through it, which encourages the insects to sting the surface. Because the bee's lance remains in its body, it does not die. Tiny quantities of the venom are then collected. It is so valuable that it costs up to £30,000 for one ounce. Bee Venom facial moisturiser costs £150 for a 50-millilitre pot, while an eye cream version costs £115 for a 25-millilitre tub. A spokesman for Rodial said: 'Bee Venom moisturiser is an advanced formula that revitalises and renews, giving naturally younger looking skin. 'It works in synergy with a unique complex of plant stem cells to help visibly improve skin tone and elasticity.' FUN FACTS: BEE VENOM SKINCARE . SOURCE: Manuka Doctor beauty, Holland & Barrett . Is it down to the bees? Older beauties Kylie and Michelle look ever youthful . 'Other ingredients refine the skin's surface to help plump and smooth the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and provide intensive moisturisation and long-lasting hydration for a radiant complexion.' Both products are available at leading High Street shops as well as department store John Lewis. Bees are already responsible for other supposedly anti-ageing products from honey to royal jelly, a health supplement used by celebrities such as Cliff Richard, Lulu and the Duchess of Cornwall. CAN'T AFFORD THE £150 POT? HERE'S WHAT ELSE IS ON THE MARKET ... No harm: The honey bee's lance remains in its body . Holland and Barrett brought us high-tech, bee venom skincare in October 2012 and made it affordable to everyone for the first time - and TV presenter Caroline Flack is a huge fan of their £24.99 ApiNourish Repairing Skin Cream. Their Manuka Doctor skincare uses the latest in bee venom technology. With over 10,000 bee stings per pot, surprisingly, this range of anti-aging wonders won't break the bank starting from £16.99 in comparison with the hundreds a botox jab will set you back. Manuka Honey, Shea Butter, Royal Jelly, Rosehip, Blackcurrant, Propolis, Coco and a whole host of other natural ingredients comprise this luxurious range. Manuka Doctor skincare products range from skin serums to cleansers and masks. Heaven Skincare, whose Venom Mask is loved by Dannii Minogue, Gwyneth Paltrow and Emilia Fox, have developed an eye-specific product to target lines and dark circles called Bee Venom Eyes. The £55 cream contains Manuka Honey, Bee Venom, and their secret ingredient River Silt to feed the tissue, firming & tightening the skin, for an instantly anti-ageing and rejuvenating effect. River Silt works with the enzymes of fish. The river bed collects marine collagen over hundreds of years, from fish enzymes, which gather in the river silt and help the skin by boosting collagen. River silt is full of amino acids and bentonite which remove impurities and toxins from the skin.

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . Cutting costs: Two-thirds of councils have switched off street lights to slash costs, a survey by the Campaign to Protect Rural England reveals today . Two-thirds of councils have switched off street lights to slash costs, a survey by the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) reveals today. And nearly half of the town halls admit to hitting the dimmer switch to make streets darker. But motoring groups say the big switch off is putting lives at risk by increasing the risk of fatal and serious accidents on the road. The CPRE report ‘Shedding Light – a survey of local authority approaches to lighting in England’ reveals more than 9 out of ten councils say they have switched off the lights to save money or energy. But fewer than half (43 per cent) have done as a measure to reduce ‘light pollution’, which the countryside campaigners support. Their report says that of the 71 councils which responded: ‘A total of 23 local authorities said they were involved in switching off street light, typically between midnight and 5am. And 32 said they were involved in dimming street lights in their areas.’ As to motivation it noted: ’Saving energy was the most important factor for local authorities who were switching off or diming street lights, followed by cost saving.’ Reducing local light pollution ‘was largely viewed as an additional benefit,’ it added. The report highlights specific councils cutting their lighting. Bradford Council is running a dimming scheme designed to save £400,000 a year and reduce power consumption by 25per cent. Essex County Council expects to save £1m per year by introducing a part-night lighting scheme. North Somerset Council are planning to save £300,000 per year through part-night lighting and dimming schemes. And Sefton Council expects to save £15,000 by trialling switching off alternate streetlights. Darkness: And nearly half of town halls admit to hitting the dimmer switch to make streets darker (file picture) The CPRE report says: ‘Almost a third of councils surveyed were switching off street lights, typically between midnight and 5am, and almost half of respondents said they were involved in dimming street lights in their areas.’ It said dimming schemes were ‘significantly more popular’ than switch off schemes with 68 per cent of respondents saying local communities had been very supportive. The report said street lighting in England costs councils about £616m per year but can account for nearly a third (30per cent) of their carbon emissions. But the AA says councils switching off street-lights to save money are putting lives at risk. Experts predict at least 750,000 street lights are being turned off or dimmed to save money and reduce emissions. Warning: AA president Edmund King has warned that councils switching off street-lights to save money are putting lives at risk . Recent research suggests that road casualties in areas where street lights have been turned off have risen by 20 per cent in four years, bucking a national trend of falling road casualties and raising fears that cost-cutting and carbon emissions targets are claiming lives. The AA said its own research showed that while night-time accidents in bad weather on 30mph urban roads had been slashed by 15.6per cent over the past five years, the fall was just 2 per cent in areas where street lights have been switched off or are not present. The AA said official statistics revealed that, on darkened 40mph built-up roads, accidents in the wet, snow or ice were down 21.8per cent where there was lighting, but by only a quarter of that - 5.2per cent - where there was not. It noted that, between 2007 and 2012, a 19.6per cent reduction in road accidents on town and city roads with street lights shrank to just 8.8 per cent where drivers and cyclists travelled in darkness. AA president Edmund King said: ‘Worse accident rates on roads with street lights turned off or not present is an insidious threat that has crept in literally under the cover of darkness. Roads that are safe when lit can become unsafe with the lights switched off. ‘With an extra casualty here and there, it is difficult to spot a creeping overall trend that might suggest something is dangerously wrong with a blackout.’ But the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) insists more action is needed by councils to tackle light pollution, particularly in the countryside. Emma Marrington, CPRE’s ‘dark skies’ campaigner, said: ‘We often hear concerns that changing street lighting can impact on public safety but our research revealed no evidence to support this. 'We’re not advocating changes where they’ re not appropriate, but why shine bright lights on residential streets, quiet roads and open countryside throughout the night when it’s not needed? ‘Genuine dark starry nights are becoming harder and harder to find which is why councils should take action to control it now.’ The report makes eight recommendations including: preserving dark skies by having a presumption against new lighting in existing dark areas; allocating lighting zones to help determine where streetlights should and should not go; and preventing ‘inappropriate and badly designed development’ that masks views of the night sky. The report says some supposedly eco-friendly low-energy LED (light emitting diode) street-lighting – sometimes criticised as ‘flying saucer lights’ - ‘has been linked with serious effects on human health’ and can create glare. It says councils should give ‘careful consideration’ to the type of LED lighting they use and ‘consider the potential impacts that higher temperature blue rich lighting has on ecology and human health.’ (ends) - winmail.dat .","Two-thirds of councils have switched off street lights to slash costs .

"By . James Slack . Visitors to Britain from 'high risk' countries will have to put up a £3,000 bond under plans introduced by Home Secretary Theresa May . Tens of thousands of visitors from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nigeria will be forced to pay a £3,000 bond to be allowed to enter Britain. They will only get the money back once they leave the country in a bid to end abuse of the visa system. Home Secretary Theresa May said the intention was to make the immigration system more ‘selective’ and deter people from ‘overstaying’ once their visitor visa has expired. In the long-term, she hopes to extend the Australian-style bond scheme to also include foreign workers and students. The idea will be welcomed by backbench Tory MPs, who have been urging the government to take a tougher line on immigration to combat the threat of UKIP. But it is likely to face legal challenges on the grounds that – because it targets only people from so-called ‘high risk’ countries – it is discriminatory. There are also fears it may lead to countries such as India making British tourists pay a similar bond. The scheme will be piloted from November, for people from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nigeria and Ghana. They are being targeted because of the high volume of visitor visa applications and relatively high levels of abuse. Mrs May said: ‘In the long run we’re interested in a system of bonds that deters overstaying and recovers costs if a foreign national has used our public services.’ The £3,000 bonds are part of Mrs May's plans to bring annual net migration to under 100,000 by 2015 . Immigration bonds have been repeatedly considered by ministers over the years, but have never been successfully introduced. Labour abandoned its own plans for a £1,000 bond in 2008 amid an outcry from migrant rights groups. They claim the policy is . discriminatory as it does not apply to people from countries such as . Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home . Affairs Select Committee, said the idea was ‘unworkable’ and . ‘impractical’. Mr Vaz, an ex-Foreign Office minister, . claimed it would not deter people from trying to stay on after their . visas ended, and said the targeted countries would be ‘likely to . retaliate’. The policy has the backing of Lib Dem . leader Nick Clegg. He suggested the introduction of bonds in March, . though was proposing the level should be fixed at £1,000. The move will require a change in the immigration rules but not a vote by MPs.","Plans by Home Secretary mean visitors lose their cash if they overstay visa .

"By . David Mccormack . Mike Moore, 30, from Mississippi spent years fighting depression after he suffered a botched circumcision operation as a small boy . A man who suffered a botched circumcision operation when he was a small boy has achieved medical history by becoming the first person to conceive a child with a reconstructed penis. Mike Moore, 30, from Mississippi and his wife become the proud parents of young Memphis six months ago. For Moore, who had spent years fighting depression and witnessed his first marriage collapse as a consequence, the birth of his first child was something that for a long time he didn’t think would ever happen. ‘The one . thing I wanted most in this world was a family, and I didn't think it . was going to happen - to have kids, to have a wife who loves me for who I . am. It wasn't going to happen, not to me,’ Moore told SF Gate. ‘Then on Oct. 4, 2013, we had Memphis, and I love that little boy with all my heart,’ he said. The . family recently travelled 2,200 miles from their home in rural . Mississippi to Palo Alto, California, to proudly introduce young Memphis . to the surgeon who had done so much to change Moore’s life for the . better. Dr. Gordon Lee, specializes in reconstructive plastic surgery at Stanford . Medical Center, and successfully operated on Moore in 2007. Scroll down for video . Mike and his wife Heather become the proud parents of young Memphis six months ago . ‘His story is, as far as I know, a first in the world for a totally reconstructed penis to go and have a baby,’ Dr Lee told NBC Bay Area. When Moore was just seven years old doctors discovered he had an infection that was preventing him from urinating properly. A routine circumcision was advised, but the procedure was botched and doctors were forced to amputate. Bullied at school for being different, Moore fell into a deep depression and suffered low self-confidence. Dr. Gordon Lee, right, who specializes in reconstructive plastic surgery at Stanford Medical Center successfully operated on Mike Moore, left, in 2007 . Superhero: Memphis' parents like to dress their son in Superman gear - even down to shoes adorned with little red capes - because his birth was a miracle for them . Then seven years ago, he met Dr. Lee after his uncle saw a news story about the surgeon’s work. Moore had already undergone three failed attempts at reconstruction surgery, but after speaking with Dr Lee, he decided to give it another go. The doctor was able to successfully reconstruct Moore’s penis using tissue from his thigh. It was only the second time Lee had ever performed the surgery. Even then Moore’s troubles weren’t immediately solved. He first marriage broke down not long after  the surgery. ‘She (his first wife) couldn't even deal with the sight of what it looked like after Dr. Lee repaired it,’ said Moore. ‘That was a major contribution to her leaving as well.’ Then in 2011, Moore met his current wife, Heather, now 25. ‘She accepted me for who I was, and not for what was wrong with me,’ said Moore. ‘She continues to this day to assure me that there's nothing wrong.’ Moore met his wife Heather in 2011. 'She accepted me for who I was, and not for what was wrong with me,' said Moore . The couple soon married, and decided to try for a baby. After so many medical procedures, Moore had wanted to do it naturally, but after several months without success they visited a fertility doctor in early 2013. He recommended artificial insemination using Moore's sperm and a month later they were celebrating Heather's pregnancy. Memphis' parents now dress their little son in Superman gear - even down to shoes adorned with little red capes - because he is their little miracle. 'I bought him Superman stuff because I knew he was a miracle,' said Moore, who typically wears a matching shirt. 'I love the symbol.' After all the bad times, Moore is happy to share his story to give hope to others who have abandoned faith that their lives could ever be 'normal.' 'If the story can help anybody, I want anybody who had to go through what I went through to know it’s possible to have a child,' he said. The couple are currently planing for another child and are hoping for a girl this time.

It's been an emotional week for former glamour model Katie Price, 35, after she found out her part-time stripper husband Kieran Hayler, 26, was having an affair with her best friend Jane Pountney, 49. Katie - who also recently discovered she was six months pregnant with her fifth child, her second with Kieran -  reportedly uncovered her third husband's affair earlier this week. The expectant mother claims she was already suspicious about her husband's friendship with long-term friend Jane after she caught the pair in a moonlit tryst on holiday - but at the time accepted the pair's emphatic claims it was a drunken kiss. Scroll down for videos . Moonlit tryst: Katie Price discovered Kieran Hayler (second right) kissing her best friend, Jane Pountney (L), on holiday in April, it's been reported . Upset: The model reportedly caught the pair in a moonlit tryst on holiday in April - but at the time accepted the pair's emphatic claims it was a drunken kiss . According the The Sun on Sunday newspaper, Katie had been on the lookout for evidence that Kieran was having an affair but never suspected it would be with her best friend. However, the pregnant star had caught the pair in a passionate embrace during their recent holiday to Cape Verde in West Africa. Katie immediately called Jane’s husband demanding he fly out to the island and talk through the tryst with the trio - which is when the pair claimed it had just been a 'drunken snog'. Lies: The former glamour model reportedly already had suspicions about the pair after she reportedly caught them having a drunken kiss in Cape Verde . While Kieran and Jane thought they had managed to convince their other halves that it was just a drunken kiss, Katie was allegedly on high alert about Kieran’s movements and behaviour. A source told The Sun: ‘When she got back from holiday she went through the internal CCTV camera footage from inside their home but found nothing incriminating’. The source also claimed that Katie had been trying to get pregnant with the couple’s second child in the hope it would make Kieran less likely to cheat on her. They added Katie felt that Kieran and Jane had made the ‘ultimate betrayal’ because their affair began while she was in hospital following the traumatic birth of her son, Jett, seven months ago. 100496 . 41727 . 105680 . 220520 . 30628 . 34668 . 5434 . 73258 . 53536 . 52826 . 60000 . 51363 . 50896 . 66874 . 71680 . 97617 . 181000 .

Price said she had ‘caught them’ and branded Mrs Pountney a ‘wh*re’, ‘sl*t’ and ‘home-wrecker’, while describing Hayler as a ‘disgusting human being’. But the husband of Mr Pountney initially denied his wife had a seven month affair with the star's spouse after leaving a 'tearful' crisis meeting on Wednesday afternoon with the feuding friends and Mr Hayler. Happier times: The couple seemed to be the picture of domestic bliss during their holiday in Cape Verde last month . Mrs Pountney has been one of Miss Price’s closest friends for almost two decades and was a bridesmaid when the Katie married Mr. Hayler little more than a year ago. She was pictured with the couple and her own husband Derrick, 52, after the lavish ceremony in the Bahamas. But it seems that friendship is over after Katie tweeted: ‘Sorry to say me and Kieran are divorcing. Him and my best friend Jane Pountney been having a full blown sexual affair for seven months.’ Following her Twitter onslaught, Miss Price later released a more eloquent statement on her website, which read: . 'I appreciate most people will have seen my tweets on the subject of my marriage to Kieran. 'I make no apologies for them though it . will be appreciated that, sending them immediately after Kieran . confirmed to me what he had been doing for the last 7 months, those . tweets were a sign of my heart breaking. That he was doing it with a . close friend of nearly 20 years is hard to understand. Anger: Katie vented her emotions on Twitter . Friendship over: The  pregnant star didn't hold back her feelings . Worst timing: The former glamour model was clearly distraught . 'This statement however is from my head, not my heart. I am appalled that someone I loved, trusted and believed in has behaved in this way. 'If he had so little respect for our relationship I would have hoped he would have thought about our child or the one that we have on the way. That he did not means he will no longer be part of my life. I will do all I can to ensure he maintains a relationship with his children should he want that. 'I am so grateful for the love of my children and family at this time.' Miss Price, who is six months pregnant, . has an eight-month-old son, Jett, with Hayler. The couple got engaged . within weeks of meeting and married in January last year.In . an interview shortly after they wed, Miss Price declared that the . former builder would receive ‘f*** all’ of her estimated £45million . fortune if they split because ‘it’s what will keep us together’. Like family: Katie and her family were joined by Jane's family at The Lego Movie premiere in Febraury 2014 . Miss Price, who has four children by three fathers, arrived with Hayler for a showdown at the Pountneys’ five-bedroom detached home in an affluent West Sussex village hours after her tweet. They were quickly let in shortly before the curtains were drawn at 3pm. Hayler left the house after just 30 minutes with no comment. When Miss Price emerged three hours later, she hid her eyes behind sunglasses and was escorted to her car by Mr Pountney.Mrs Pountney, who has a ten-year-old son and is a director of her husband’s tyre recycling business, was also a bridesmaid for Miss Price when she married Alex Reid in Las Vegas in 2010.

"By . Hugo Gye . A 40m water tower dating back to the Victorian era and nicknamed 'Jumbo' is going up for sale after its former owner failed in a bid to turn it into a block of flats. The grade II*-listed building, constructed in 1883, dominates the town of Colchester in Essex and is England's tallest 19th century water tower. It has stood disused for more than 25 years, following a series of failed attempts to secure planning permission to transform it into a luxury home. Scroll down for video . For sale: This 40m-high water tower nicknamed 'Jumbo' dominates the town of Colchester in Essex . The height of the tower means that it has unparalled views over the town and the surrounding area. It was built to store Colchester's water supply, using 1.2million bricks and 400 tonnes of cement. The tower is topped with a viewing platform, accessed via a central spiral staircase with a total of 157 steps. It went out of use for the last time in 1987, leading to a long-running battle over its future. An evangelical Christian group converted the building into a 'prayer tower' and installed a banner saying 'Jesus is Lord' across the exterior. Historic: The tower was built in the Victorian era but has now been disused for more than 25 years . Cross-section: This plan shows the intricate structure of the  building, a masterpiece of civil engineering . Jumbo was then bought by a property developer who attempted to turn it into a block of flats - but the council blocked the proposal in a bid to preserve the tower's historic interior. In 2006, businessman George Braithwaite bought the tower at auction for £330,000, with permission to turn it into a single home. However, he proposed a more ambitious renovation project including a museum, restaurant, offices and flats, and last year he was denied planning permission. Mr Braithwaite has now put the tower back on the market, but has not yet revealed what the asking price will be. Dominant: The tower is a well-known local landmark thanks to its striking appearance and huge size . 'The Jumbo water tower is a wonderful example of Victorian civic architecture,' said David Ross of tourism website Britain Express. 'The striking brick tower standing 131 feet high is built to hold 221,000 gallons of water. 'Beset by technical problems and political wrangling when it was built, the tower represents a marvellous feat of Victorian engineering that deserves its place as an icon of historic Colchester. 'It would be a travesty if an historic building like Jumbo was lost to future generations - it encapsulates the boundless self-confidence of the Victorian age, and should be preserved as a heritage treasure for future generations.' Historic: The tower was built in 1882, but its future is now uncertain as it goes up for sale . The new owner of 'Jumbo' will possess one of the most striking buildings in Essex - but it could prove to be a white elephant. Since the tower went out of use in 1987, a variety of new uses have been proposed, but none of them has ever come to fruition. After a brief period of use as a 'prayer tower', festooned with a banner proclaiming a Christian message, a property developer tried to turn Jumbo into luxury flats. After that plan fell through, an even more ambitious proposal to install a museum, restaurant and offices was also denied planning permission. The new owner will probably be able to build a penthouse flat in the tower - but would have to provide public access to the viewing platform 40m up from the ground. A number of campaign groups have in the past pushed to preserve Jumbo as a monument to the great Victorian era of civil engineering. One plan would see it opened to the public in a bid to educate people about the way the Victorians helped ensure access to clean water for the whole of Britain for the first time ever. The Balkerne Tower Trust is currently seeking donations to enable it to bid for Jumbo at the forthcoming sale and restore the tower to its former glory.","The water tower in Colchester was built in 1883 using 400 tonnes of cement .

United: Indo-Tibetan Border Police at the consulate held off the assault until Afghanistan's National Army (ANA) soldiers arrived to help secure the consulate . 'Our consulate and our diplomatic presence in Afghanistan have been under threat,' Akbaruddin told TimesNow TV, without elaborating. Herat lies near Afghanistan's border with Iran and is considered one of the safer cities in the country, with a strong Iranian influence. In September 2013, Taliban gunmen launched a similar assault on the U.S. Consulate in the city, killing at least four Afghans but failing to enter the compound or hurt any Americans. Foreign embassies and consulates remain a favorite target of insurgents in Afghanistan, but many are protected by high walls and multiple gates, as well as security forces. India has invested more than $2billion in Afghan projects, including roads and power projects. In August 2013, a botched bombing against the Indian Consulate in the Afghan city of Jalalabad near the border with Pakistan killed nine people, including six children. No Indian officials were hurt.

Groups known for targeting Indian interests include Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was blamed for the 2008 attack on the Indian city of Mumbai that killed 166 people, and the Haqqani network, which is based in Pakistan's lawless tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan. Lashkar-e-Taiba has been active in Afghanistan in recent years, often teaming up with insurgent groups operating in the eastern part of the country near the frontier with Pakistan. In 2010, two Kabul guest houses popular among Indians were attacked, killing more than six Indians. India blamed that attack on the group. The violence comes as the Taliban has launched its annual spring offensive promising to step up attacks against Afghan security forces in a bid to undermine the Western-backed government. The Taliban also have pledged to disrupt voting as Afghans prepare for a second round of presidential elections on June 14. The first round was relatively peaceful, but no candidate won a majority forcing a runoff vote between the top two candidates — Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai.

"By . James Rush . An inquest into the death of Reggae star Smiley Culture today heard he plunged a kitchen knife into his heart during a drugs raid at his home . A British reggae star plunged a kitchen knife into his heart during a drugs raid on his home, an inquest heard today. DJ Smiley Culture, whose real name was David Emmanuel, suddenly changed as officers searched his home after initially appearing calm and relaxed. The 48-year-old musician screamed: 'Do you f***ing want some of this?' as he plunged the knife into his chest. Today a jury heard four Metropolitan Police officers carried out a raid on Mr Emmanuel’s home in Warlingham, Surrey, on March 15, 2011. At the time he was awaiting trial at Croydon Crown Court with two co-defendants for allegedly supplying class A drugs. Giving an overview of events Surrey Coroner Richard Travers said officers arrived at the gated property at 7am on the fateful day and arrested Mr Emmanuel on conspiracy to import Class A drugs. One of the officers had had previous dealings with the musician and always found him 'courteous, respectful, and compliant,' the jury heard. As a result he was deemed low risk. Mr Travers explained that one of the officers remained with Mr Emmanuel while the other three searched the property. During this time he appeared relaxed and was allowed to make himself a number of cups of tea, the coroner said. The musician’s niece called at the address in the middle of the search and described her uncle as 'calm and a little bewildered.' Mr Travers said: 'You’ll hear from . witness two that he was coming to the end of the search and started the . final entry in the premises search record, which was entry 13, when Mr . Emmanuel suddenly, without warning, stood up and witness two realised he . - Mr Emmanuel - had a large knife in his hand. 'The officer says he shouted out ""knife,"" so as to warn other colleagues which were present. Police outside the home of DJ Smiley Cutlure, in Warlingham, Surrey, in March 2011 . 'Mr Emmanuel screamed: ""Do you f***ing want some of this or what about this?"" 'You will hear that the face and body language completely changed and he was screaming.' Using both hands he then plunged the knife into his chest. 'You’ll hear from . witness two that he was coming to the end of the search and started the . final entry in the premises search record, which was entry 13, when Mr . Emmanuel suddenly, without warning, stood up and witness two realised he - Mr Emmanuel - had a large knife in his hand' - Coroner Richard Travers . Despite the efforts of officers to perform first aid he was declared dead at the scene. A post mortem examination concluded he died as a result of loss of blood due to a stab wound. Pathologist Dr Robert Chapman said the injury would have required moderate force. The coroner told the jury that the four officers who were at the address at the time of Mr Emmanuel’s death will be giving evidence at the hearing from behind screens. He ruled that they cannot be named for legal reasons. Mr Emmanuel had worked with Maxi Priest and Papa Levi and saw his singles, Cockney Translation and Police Officer, chart in 1984. The latter song was about him being arrested for possession of cannabis but then being let off when the officer realised he was a famous reggae artist. The hearing in Woking, Surrey, was expected to last up to three weeks. The hearing in front of a jury of five men and six women continues. VIDEO: Smiley Culture - Cockney Translation .

As Clifford waited for the verdicts, his wife was strolling in the Cotswolds village where she has a three-bedroom £600,000 stone cottage. She fought back tears after hearing he had been convicted. When asked if it was true she had left her husband, Mrs Clifford said: ‘I really can’t comment on that.’ The sex predator was jailed for eight years at Southwark Crown Court, for offences carried out between 1977 and 1984.

I was inspired by the brilliant, tireless young women and met I met at HQ.' Mr Axelrod is also following @Ed_Milliband, a parody account which has not posted since 2012. A Tory party source said: 'Perhaps they should all wear name badges around the shadow cabinet table, just so Axelrod doesn't call him David.' The tie-up between Mr Axelrod and Labour - reportedly with £300,000 - has been beset by spelling problems. Announcing his arrival, a Labour press release stated: 'David Alexrod joins the team.' Labour leader Ed Miliband held a shadow cabinet meeting accompanied for the first time by his new superstar American advisor David Axelrod . Mr Miliband played down the gaffe - pointing out that he had himself been left red-faced by social media errors. 'That's the perils of tweeting. I have been a victim of bad tweeting myself,' he said. In . 2012, a post on the Labour leader's account marking the death of TV . presenter Bob Holness referred to him as the host of Blackbusters rather . than Blockbusters. 'That's the kind of thing that happens,' he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. Mr . Miliband denied the hiring of Mr Axelrod signalled an intent to engage . in a negative campaign, insisting he brought in the man credited with . helping secure two White House terms for Mr Obama for 'his values'. 'This is what he has been saying to us this week. I will let you into the secret,' he said. 'It . is all about what he sees and what I see as an absolutely defining . question for our generation. 'You see growing inequality in many . developed countries and the question so many people are asking - and . that is why I think this is such an unpredictable election because there . is big discontent - is about whether hard work and building a good life . for yourself and your family, whether that is now permanently . disconnected.

He . won fame in the States after helping to convince Americans to pick . their first black president in 2008 and then helped Barack Obama's . re-election four years later. But . the two Presidential triumphs are only the highest profile in a string of Democrat successes . that have made the 59-year-old New Yorker a back room political superstar. It began 30 . years ago when, fresh from quitting his job as the youngest political . editor in the history of the Chicago Tribune, he helped oust a three-term Republican senator for Illinois. Three . years later, he was a key member of the team that helped re-elect Chicago's first black mayor Harold Washington. But he has not been as successful in Europe as he was in the States. Former Italian prime minister Mario Monti secured only 10.5% of the vote in Italy last year despite the guru's advice. Two polls yesterday gave Labour a small . lead, after a disastrous week in which the Tories gained a lead in the . polls for the first time in two years, and frontbenchers saying that . Labour are bracing themselves for a minority government. Mr Axelrod said when he was hired: 'I think candidates who can win are candidates . who articulate a vision that speaks to the lives and concerns of the . people they are running to represent.’ The . strategist - known as ‘The Axe’ - gave a short speech to the shadow . cabinet, telling them the cost of living message is the right one, but . it has to resonate with middle class people. He . then held meetings with key frontbenchers including Harriet Harman and . Ed Balls, and addressed party staff about campaigning techniques. Labour's former election coordinator Tom Watson has . admitted the party are having a ‘judder’ amid dismal poll ratings, and . that some in the party ‘predict disaster’ for Ed Miliband. Mr Watson, writing on a Labour website, . acknowledged the recent ‘struggles and difficulties’ but urged the party . to pull together ahead of the local and European elections next week. In a blog entitled ’10 reasons to be cheerful’ he reassured activists they could win over Ukip supporters, by telling them the party’s policy is a flat rate of tax for everyone from bankers to cleaners, and breaking up the NHS. He added that Labour could win back seats from the Liberal Democrats, who he said were in ‘long term decline’ and had struggled to get candidates to stand, and that the party had to coax out the under-25 to vote, as 65 per cent of them back Labour.

"By . Luke Garratt . A First World War bomb killed two construction site workers when it exploded 100 years after being fired at a Belgian battlefield. The bomb had laid dormant for a century at an industrial site in the former area of Flanders battlegrounds, killing two and injuring two more. Johan Lescrauwaert of the Ypres prosecutor's office confirmed that the armament from the 1914-1918 war exploded near the workers, but did not say whether it was a shell or a grenade. Emergency personnel remove evidence near a covered body after a World War One armament exploded in Ypres, Belgium . It was not confirmed whether the bomb was a grenade or a shell, but it has been confirmed that it killed two and injured two more . The circumstances were unclear because there was apparently no digging at the site - the usual cause of such accidents . Every year the battlefields in western Belgium throw up hundreds of armaments from the Great War, and most are destroyed without incident by a special Belgian army bomb squad. In a nearby city, the army was completing the destruction of over 800 gas canisters. More and more unexploded shells are discovered every year in the areas in and around the former Flanders field battleground . Evacuation works are the common cause of exploding the dormant shells, as the heavy machinery used in the process can jostle the delicate armaments back to life, although this case was peculiar because no digging took place . The Flanders battlefields cover dozens of cities where allies clashed with German forces for most of the war. Earlier this year, members of the bomb disposal unit managed to disarm an unexploded shell at a construction site in Ypres, Northwestern Belgium. Also earlier this month, a large amount of ammunition from the First World War was discovered on the border of the West Flemish municipalities of Passchendaele and Moorslede, for which the Belgian bomb squad is still working to clean up the site . Earlier this month members of the bomb disposal unit in Ypres, Belgium, were lucky as they managed to evacuate and disarm a WWI-era bomb before it exploded . The unexploded bomb from January 2014 was found during similar evacuation works to the ones that caused a bomb to explode this month .","Armament was disturbed and exploded evacuation works at the site .

Spicy crab porridge, seaweed flakes and sardines are set to replace the traditional fry-up and sugary cereals on Britain’s breakfast tables. A revolution in the ingredients that feature in the most important meal of the day has been forecast in a study by Kellogg’s, chefs and food stylists. The research suggests that greater foreign travel, coupled with influences from China and Scandinavia, will change the nation’s eating habits. Fishy business: Crab porridge with kippers could become a typical way to start the day thanks to overseas influences, experts say . A recent report suggested that time-pressed Britons have compressed eating breakfast to a three-minute snack stop as they race off to work. However, the Kellogg’s study claims that within 10-15 years, breakfast will be come as important as the evening meal, consisting of three courses. It said: ‘Our tastes are predicted to change thanks to a variety of influences, such as low-cost air travel, making holidaymakers more adventurous and introducing flavours they want to replicate at home. ‘Emigration and immigration will also have a major impact on the British palate with the main influences predicted to come from Poland, China, the Middle East and Scandinavia.’ The study said: ‘The greatest change that we will see is a move towards hot, spicy and savoury breakfast products. ‘In China, this is the norm and it is predicted that cold winter mornings will soon be warmed with ""Warm Crab Porridge with Seaweed"". Has-beans: British families will move away from the traditional breakfast fry-up as tastes change, claim researchers . ‘In the future Middle Eastern spices such as the brightly coloured Sumac and hot chillies will also be used to add flavour to foods – with people initially shaking them on to their cereals and resulting in Sumac or Fiery breakfast cereal products on shelves. ‘An increasing focus on health will also drive new superfood flavours and experts predict the next superfood fad will be seaweed – with seaweed breakfast flakes set to be the next big thing.’ Seaweed is full of essential micronutrients, while seaweed granules are already being touted as a healthy alternative to salt in processed food. The panel of experts said: ‘The Scandinavian influence will make fish a more popular breakfast choice and coupled with the need for a convenient and microwaveable cooked breakfast, we will move away from traditional sausage, bacon and black pudding to products such as kedgeree, kippers, sardines, fish fingers, devilled kidneys and potted fish in our Full English.’ TV food expert and top chef Guy Wolley, who was on the Kellogg’s panel behind the study, said: ‘At the moment the UK has a taste for relatively plain breakfast flavours and the elements haven’t changed much since the 1930s. ‘In the future we will take breakfast much more seriously and it may become the main meal of the day. We will also see some very different tastes and trends emerging. Seaweed, spices and fish will become popular in the morning. ‘Dishes such as crab porridge and sumac flakes for breakfast may seem unbelievable but 20 years ago it would have seemed absurd that we would be eating raw fish wrapped in rice and seaweed – of course sushi is now a very popular cuisine.’","Influence from China and Scandinavia will change nation's eating habits .

Martin wore a hooded sweater and carried Skittles and an Arizona-brand drink, when he was fatally shot by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman on February 12, 2012, in Florida. The Texas prosecutor also allegedly wrote that 'low information voters carried the day for the Dalibama in the last election.' He also allegedly posted a graphic titled 'Obama: Why Stupid People Shouldn't Vote.' The graphic and description have not been made available to the media, but were reportedly seen by The Beaumont Enterprise.

"By . Jenny Hope . Formula baby milk can contain 100 times more aluminium than breast milk, potentially causing health problems in later life, claim researchers. Traces of the metal in milk from some of the UK’s leading products were found to be much higher than is legally allowed in water, according to scientists at Keele University, Staffordshire. Top brands including Aptamil, Cow And Gate and Hipp Organic all contained levels of aluminium which are too high, say the researchers. Formula baby milk can contain 100 times more aluminium than breast milk, potentially causing health problems in later life, claim researchers . Their study, published in the journal BMC Pediatrics, examined 30 types of formula sold in the UK, including infant first milks and toddler milks. Previous research has linked aluminium to neurological diseases, bone defects and dementia in later life. Manufacturers say they do not add aluminium to their products, but many formulas are often packaged in aluminium foil and the metal may be found in the ingredients or processing. It occurs naturally in soya plants due to the acidic soil they are grown in. Experts are now calling for manufacturers to dramatically lower the amount of aluminium that ends up in their products or print the aluminium level they contain so parents can make an informed choice on which formula to buy. Traces of the metal in milk from some of the UK's leading products were found to be much higher than is legally allowed in water, according to scientists at Keele University, Staffordshire . Study leader Professor Chris Exley, who raised the alarm three years ago with a similar study, said some formulas have aluminium levels 100 times higher than the same amount of breast milk. He said ‘We believe this is too much aluminium to be subjecting a human to at their most vulnerable stage of life. ‘We know an awful lot about aluminium but we don’t know an awful lot about how it impacts on human health. ‘People have almost certainly heard about the link with Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological conditions and we know from studies that it influences the way in which bones form. ‘Aluminium can also produce anaemia in individuals, which is not then helped by giving people more iron. ‘How may this aluminium be impacting on the immediate and long-term health of the baby - these are questions that are still unanswered. ‘What we don’t know is whether aluminium is accumulating in the bodies of formula-fed babies. If it is, aluminium has no biological function at all, you have no requirement for it. ‘Simply the fact we don’t have experiments showing that it’s either safe or not safe in humans certainly doesn’t mean it’s not an issue.’ The study involved both ready-to-drink formulas and powdered varieties - all 30 types were found to contain aluminium. Results showed both ready-to-drink and powdered varieties had a similar concentration of aluminium overall, but it was highest in soya-based milks. Among ready-to-drink types, SMA toddler milk had the lowest concentration, followed by Hipp Organic first infant milk, Aptamil hungry baby milk, SMA first infant milk and Aptamil first milk. The growing up milks produced by Cow And Gate and Aptamil had the highest concentrations. For powdered milks, Hipp Organic growing up milk had the lowest level, followed by Aptamil hungry, Aptamil first milk and Hipp Organic follow-on milk. At the other end of the scale, soya-based formulations had the highest concentrations of aluminium but SMA toddler milk and Hipp Organic first infant milk also had high levels. The law states aluminium levels in water can be no more than 200 micrograms per litre, meaning some of the milks contained several times this level. However, European limits in water are not based on health risks but on aesthetic considerations about the colour of water. The Food Standards Agency has previously said it does not have concerns about aluminium intake based on cow’s milk infant formula. Soya-based milks should be used on the advice of a GP as they are likely to contain higher levels. Professor Exley, a chemist, accused the manufacturers of complacency, saying: ‘We expected something to be done about this since our last research but, if anything, the amount of aluminium in packaging has increased.’ Top brands including Aptamil, Cow And Gate and Hipp Organic all contained levels of aluminium which are too high, say the researchers . Professor Exley said it was unclear how the aluminium was getting into the milk. He said: ‘There’s a very good chance that some of this aluminium is coming from the packaging and an equal chance it is in the ingredients. Processing is also likely to be a source.’ Prof Exley said: ‘Clearly the manufacturers of infant formulas are not concerned about reducing their content of aluminium and the extensive use of aluminium-based packaging for infant formulas seems to confirm this. ‘There are no adequate criteria upon which to base a safety level for aluminium in infant formulas and for this reason it would be sensible to take action to reduce the level of aluminium to a lowest practicable level.’","Traces of metal in milk from leading products found to be much higher than is legally allowed in water, according to research .

"By . Steve Doughty . Judges and social workers have been conspiring to remove children unjustly from their parents, a scathing High Court ruling said today. It condemned family court judges for a ‘clandestine arrangement’ which meant that they simply rubber-stamped the demands of social workers without giving a fair hearing to the pleas of parents. Rulings by family judges were ‘cut and pasted’ from recommendations emailed to the court by social workers, the High Court found. Judges and social workers have been conspiring to remove children unjustly from their parents, a High Court ruling suggested today (stock picture) The secret dealings between council officials and local judges were revealed in a High Court appeal in which Mrs Justice Pauffley ordered that a mother be re-united with her baby. The baby was taken by social workers following a court case described by Mrs Justice Pauffley as ‘profoundly alarming’. The High Court judge warned that ‘the practices I have described are not confined to this area but are widespread across the country'. She said of the case, which involved judges at an unnamed family court and social workers employed by an unnamed council: ‘It is difficult to view the justices as having been independent and impartial if, as happened here, they simply adopted the local authority’s analysis of what their findings and reasons might comprise. ‘Just because there may be tacit acceptance on the part of many professionals within the family justice system that the practice which operated here exists, that does not mean it is right. ‘It is patently wrong, must stop at once and never happen again.’ The order to end collusion between judges and social workers was endorsed yesterday by the most senior family judge, President of the Family Division Sir James Munby. In a circular to lawyers, Sir James warned all judges and lawyers to ‘carefully consider’ the case and added that Mrs Justice Pauffley ‘had to deal with circumstances which I hope will never recur.’ The scandal over secret deals between judges and social workers is the latest upheaval in a year of growing controversy over the family courts, the closely-associated Court of Protection, and the way the public has been routinely prevented from knowing what goes on in them. Last year the Daily Mail revealed that a judge at the Court of Protection had sent a woman to jail in secret after she refused to stop trying to remove her father from a care home where she believed his life was in danger. All information about the imprisonment of Wanda Maddocks was banned from publication until the Mail investigated the case. In December the Court of Protection was discovered to have ordered behind closed doors that a pregnant Italian woman must undergo a compulsory caesarean operation. The mother, Alessandra Pacchieri, was later told by a family court judge, again in secret, that her baby would be taken for adoption in Essex. The order to end collusion between judges and social workers was endorsed yesterday by the most senior family judge, President of the Family Division Sir James Munby . The secrecy surrounding the two court systems is now being loosened on the instructions of Sir James, who has acted to prevent both clandestine imprisonment and the removal of children from foreign mothers by British judges. The exposure of private arrangements between family judges and social workers was exposed following an appeal by a mother whose child was taken into care. The 32-year-old mother, a longstanding drug and drink abuser with a history of domestic violence, had had seven previous children. Six are living with their two fathers and one is in the process of being adopted. When she became pregnant again, she was given a place in a unit run by a specialist family drugs and alcohol service. Mrs Justice Pauffley said it was ‘plain’ that social workers took a decision in advance to remove her baby, who was born in October last year. They cited the mother’s bleak history. Family judges first heard the case on 1 November. They were presented with an expert report on the mother, commissioned by social workers and prepared by chartered clinical psychologist Dr Celest Van Rooyen. The psychologist, who also gave ‘very strong and powerful’ evidence in person, said the baby was at risk of harm. The judges declared that ‘the immediate risk of harm is such that his safety requires the continuing removal from his mother’s care. It is proportionate and in his best interests.’ At a second hearing a week later, the same judges said the baby should stay with foster parents because ‘he needs to form an attachment with his primary carers.’ Mrs Justice Pauffley criticised the handling of the case in blunt and uncompromising language. She said the Van Rooyen report on the mother had been researched and written in a day and the psychologist had spoken neither to the mother nor the medical and psychological experts with whom she and the baby were living. Instead, Dr Van Rooyen had relied on documents and a phone call to a social worker. Mrs Justice Pauffley said: ‘It surprises and alarms me that Dr Van Rooyen was asked, and was prepared, to provide a report during the course of a single working day, a terrifyingly tight timeframe, and on the basis of papers supplemented by a telephone conversation with a local authority professional who had never met the mother. ‘I struggle to understand how Dr Van Rooyen’s apparently firm opinions, adverse to the mother, could have been formed given the complete absence of any kind of discussion with her.’ The High court judge said the family court judges had not written their own ‘findings of fact and reasons’ - their ruling in the case. The entire document had instead been emailed to them by lawyers for the local council before the 1 November hearing. John Hemming, the Lib Dem MP who has campaigned against secrecy in the family courts, said: 'I am pleased that the senior judges are acting to stop stitch ups and ""clandestine"" fixing of decisions in the lower courts' A near-identical document was drawn up by the judges after the second hearing. Mrs Justice Pauffley said this was ‘the result, almost certainly of cutting and pasting.’ Mrs Justice Pauffley said this practice ‘has become the norm’ in local family courts. She said she was ‘profoundly alarmed’ at the practice, which was widespread. ‘There was, apparently, an established but largely clandestine arrangement between the local authority and the court which, to my mind, has considerable repercussions for justice.’ Mrs Justice Pauffley added: ‘In public law proceedings the local authority is the applicant. It is not and should never be seen as the decision maker. That is the role of the court. ‘There is no room for confusion. Justice must be upheld. There is no scope for dilution of that fundamental concept.’ John Hemming, the Lib Dem MP who has campaigned against secrecy in the family courts, said: ‘I am pleased that the senior judges are acting to stop stitch ups and “clandestine” fixing of decisions in the lower courts. ‘What really matters, however, is getting independent evidence into the process rather than the opinion of local authority employees who are instructed in what to say by their management, who are instructed by government as to what outcomes they want.’","Judges and social workers have been conspiring to remove children unjustly from their parents, scathing High Court ruling said today .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Updated: . 15:00 EST, 21 November 2011 . Meditation could help temper the symptoms of ADHD and Alzheimer's scientists say. A groundbreaking study has revealed that the ancient relaxation technique can switch off areas of the brain associated with a range of psychiatric disorders. It is now hoped that the findings will shed light on how neurological diseases work and prompt the development of effective treatment. Meditation could help temper the symptoms of ADHD and Alzhemeimer's according to scientists from Yale University . Past research has shown meditation, which has become increasingly popular over recent years, has helped people quit smoking, cope with cancer, and even prevent psoriasis. But scientists at Yale University now believe it can help people to stay focused and boost happiness, slowing down the onset of dementia. Lead researcher Judson Brewer said: 'Meditation's ability to help people . stay in the moment has been part of philosophical and contemplative . practices for thousands of years. 'Conversely, the hallmarks of many forms of mental . illness is a preoccupation with one's own thoughts, a condition . meditation seems to affect. Brain scans revealed that meditators had decreased activity in an area of the brain implicated in a range of neurological disorders . 'This gives us some nice cues as to the . neural mechanisms of how it might be working clinically.' During the study, detailed in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, both experienced and novice meditators were monitored as they practiced three different meditation techniques. Brain scans revealed that experienced meditators . had decreased activity in area called the default mode . network. This region of the brain has been implicated in lapses of attention and disorders . such as anxiety, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, and even . the build-up of beta amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease. Reduced . activity was shown regardless of the type meditation and also during . rest, suggesting that experienced meditators are less susceptible . diseases such as autism, schizophrenia. In a similar vein the University . of Wisconsin is planning a study early next year to investigate the . neurological effects of meditation and yoga with veterans. It is thought mindfulness meditation holds promise for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which provokes intrusive thoughts, . emotional numbness and hypervigilance. Mindfulness-based . cognitive therapy (MBCT), which combines meditation with orthodox . 'thought training', is already recommended for depression in Britain and is . available on the NHS. A report published by a mental health charity last year argued that if more GPs could offer the . therapy it would cut the financial burden of . depression, which costs the UK £7.5 billion a year.","Meditation decreased activity in area in the brain implicated in a range of neurological disorders .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Allegations: HSBC has made nearly £100m through 'bankrolling' forestry companies who have destroyed vast swathes of the Malaysian rainforest . Global banking giant HSBC has raked in nearly £100m by bankrolling Malaysian logging companies who cause widespread rainforest destruction and abuse human rights, a watchdog has claimed. The bank is also providing financial services to companies widely suspected of systematic bribery and corruption in Sarawak, Malaysia, according to an investigation by The Global Witness. The region exports more tropical timber than South America and Africa combined and HSBC's loans and services to logging conglomerates have generated at least £80m in interest and fees. The watchdog claim that these companies have devastated Malaysian Borneo's rainforests and carried out abuses against indigenous peoples. These companies are currently logging in an area three times the size of Norway. 'HSBC has bankrolled some of the world's worst logging companies and in some cases got them off the ground with their first commercial loans,' said Tom Picken, Global Witness Forest Campaign leader. 'The destruction they have caused simply couldn't have happened without the services and kudos the bank provided.' The Global Witness report, entitled 'In the Future There Will Be No Forests Left', also suggests that HSBC is at risk of violating international anti-money laundering regulations because of its links to Malaysia's 'corrupt' forestry sector. Because Sarawak is headed by Chief Minister Abdul Taib Mahmud, currently under investigation by Malaysia's Federal Anti-Corruption unit, HSBC could fall foul of regulations requiring extra checks on clients linked to senior politicians. Taib is widely believed to use his complete political control over the region's forestry licensing to benefit his family and associates, says the report. Global Witness say they have obtained strong evidence showing Taib and members of his family are engaged in systemic corruption and money laundering. Destruction: The report claims that four Malaysian logging companies are being bankrolled by HSBC while in breach of the company's own regulations . 'In light of recent money-laundering scandals, HSBC and its financial regulators urgently need to find out whether the bank is handling illegal transactions from this notoriously corrupt and destructive sector,' added Picken. The report names four forestry companies linked to HSBC who have violated the bank's 2004 forestry regulations, which state that operations must be certified to the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). None of the four had any FSC certification. They include: . Endangered: Global Witness say at least one of the logging companies is devastating the habitat of orangutangs in Malaysia . Picken added: 'In 2004 HSBC brought in progressive world-wide forest policies designed to avoid precisely these sorts of commercial relationships and make the bank a market leader on sustainability. 'It has consistently traded on these commitments in public, yet failed to meet them in practice. The bank should hold its hands up, drop these clients immediately and compensate the victims for the mayhem it has helped cause.' A HSBC spokesman said: 'HSBC cannot discuss current or former clients, whether individuals or corporates, for reasons of confidentiality - in fact to do so would be against the law.' 'HSBC remains committed to sustainable banking, working with interested parties and undertaking responsible engagement with clients to ensure they meet and continue to comply with its sector-specific policies. 'We value the information that NGOs can provide us to help us improve our Sustainability Risk Policies over time and also to help us assess the commitment, capacity and track record of our customers to implement them. 'We look forward to reading your report on forestry in Sarawak and will follow up on credible evidence of social or environmental impact and will take action where necessary.'","New report claims bank is earning millions in interest from loans to 'corrupt' logging companies who are destroying swathes of endangered rainforest .

He told the Guangzhou Daily that police were on the scene within a minute and began shooting. Guangzhou police said its officers 'arrived quickly on the scene' and shot one of the attackers. The official Nanfang Daily said another suspect had been caught by police after fleeing the scene. 'After verbal warnings were ineffective, police fired, hitting one male suspect holding a knife, and subdued him,' Guangzhou police said on an official microblog.

Nervousness about Islamic militancy has grown since a car exploded on the edge of Beijing's Tiananmen Square in October and 29 people were stabbed to death in March in the southwestern city of Kunming. The government blamed militants from Xinjiang for both those attacks and a more recent bomb and knife attack at a train station in Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital, that killed one and wounded 79 last Wednesday. Resource-rich and strategically located, the province on the borders of central Asia has for years been beset by violence blamed by the Chinese government on Islamist militants. Exiles and many rights groups say the real cause of the unrest in Xinjiang is China's heavy-handed policies, including curbs on Islam and the culture and language of the Muslim Uighur people.","Assailants carrying long knives pounced on passengers leaving the station .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Banks claim Zapp payment technology will be safer than using a debit card . UK shoppers will soon be able leave their wallets at home thanks to a new app that will allow them to pay with their smartphones. HSBC, First Direct, Nationwide, Santander and Metro Bank have announced that they will offer Zapp mobile payments to 18 million customers across the UK. Together, this group represents over a third of all UK bank accounts with 60 per cent of the country’s businesses able to take advantage of the service. Zapp will be integrated onto a mobile banking application. The customers will be able to see their balances on each account, and choose which one to pay from. When customers reach the checkout of a shop that accepts Zapp payments, they will have a special code sent to their mobile phone. Alternatively, customers will be able to scan a code into the handset from a bill in a restaurant or the screen on a card machine. The code will contain all the information about the transaction including the price, the retailer's details and information about the items being purchased. These will appear on the customer's mobile screen. Once a customer has then logged into the mobile banking app they will then confirm or reject the transaction with a tap of the finger. Zapp claims the whole process will take about 12 seconds. The payments work through something known as ‘digital tokens’ which means customers can keep their financial details private. Banks claim the technology will be safer . than using a debit card, as the unique code for that purchase will . expire after three minutes. Scroll down for video .

Unlike chip and pin cards, Zapp doesn't hand over sensitive information, such as card numbers and expiry dates, that can be used by criminals to commit fraud. As well as this, only retailers signed up to the scheme will be able to generate the codes. ‘When you pay with a card in a shop or online, you give the merchant all sorts of details that would be dangerous in the hands of a fraudster,’ said Peter Keenan, Zapp’s chief executive. ‘With Zapp, nothing is revealed, so it’s much more secure.’ The Centre for Economic and Business Research estimates that 20 million people will use their mobiles to pay for goods and services by the end of the decade. However, experts haven’t ruled out safety fears. During Zapp’s development last year, Justin Modray, of finance website Candid Money, said: ‘Paying by smartphone obviously appeals to some and is growing in popularity. ‘However, it remains to be seen whether this throws up any major security issues. ‘The new technology will have to be extremely fool-proof or it will cause more problems than it solves.’ The Centre for Economic and Business Research estimates that 20 million people will use their mobiles to pay for goods and services by the end of the decade . A number of similar digital wallets are already being used by customer, including PayPal’s app and SumUp Pay. Both have designed a ‘frictionless’ payment experience, whereby customers can pay by speaking their name rather than fumbling for a wallet or phone. It works when a customer links their card details to an app and then authorises which companies are allowed to charge them directly.

"By . Andrew Levy . Deprived: Mr Emmett said that female 'gatekeepers' make it harder for boys to enjoy reading . Boys are being put off reading because of the influence women have on children’s literature, says  an award-winning children’s author. Jonathan Emmett warned that children’s books were too girly because of the influence of mostly female panels of editors, publishers, reviewers and judges. One publishing company’s research suggested women bought 95 per cent of picture books for children, he added. The writer believes boys are being starved of what they enjoy in books, such as swashbuckling pirates, battles, or technical details about space ships and so are driven to more action-packed video games instead. 'It is a really difficult argument to make because 99 times out of 100 it is women that are under-represented,’ said Mr Emmett. ‘But there is a literacy gap - boys are underachieving, boys do not like books as much as girls. ‘I am arguing that this is because the industry is dominated by female gatekeepers.’ The author and illustrator, a former winner of the Red House Children’s Award for ‘Pigs Might Fly’, looked at 450 reviews in five national newspapers. He found 41 per cent of children’s fiction books were by men but more than two-thirds of reviews were by women. Men were responsible for 47 per cent of picture books but more than 80 per cent of reviews were by women. Study: Mr Emmett conducted a study uncovering the large proportions of publishers, reviewers and award judges who are female . And he found for the past two years, every one of the 13 judges of the prestigious children’s book awards, the CILIP Carnegie and Kate Greenaway medals, has been women. He also drew on personal experience, explaining how only two of the 50 editors he had dealt with were men. One publishing company told him it carried out research which suggested women bought 95 per cent of picture books for children. ‘Mums and grans buy books - that’s what’s driving the market,’ he told The Times. ‘They read the book also and then there’s a tendency for the book to reflect their tastes as well. So there may be a pirate but that pirate will not be engaged in a battle. ‘The number of times I have tried to get technical information into a book and it is deemed inappropriate. ‘It is one of the things that leads boys and girls with boy-typical tastes, to say “I am not really interested in that kind of content, I am more interested in the content of video games”.’ A gap in reading ability is already apparent between boys and girls by the time they are five, according to a parliamentary commission report. This translates into a year’s difference in reading skills as they go through school.","Jonathan Emmett warned of the influence of 'female gatekeepers'

In the short clip, recorded on a car's dash camera, a bright object can be seen streaking across the sky before breaking into pieces and disappearing. The scenes are reminiscent of the 2013 Russian meteor which exploded in the sky over Chelyabinsk, shattering glass in nearby buildings and injuring 1,200 people. Scroll down for video . Dashcam footage has emerged of a suspected meteor exploding over the Russian region of Murmansk . The the footage, shot just after 2.10am local time, shows a bright light appearing in the sky above a road . Some have cast doubt on the new extra-terrestrial object, pointing out that Russia has a military base nearby and it could simply be a missile test, but no long range tests were scheduled for that evening. Witnesses in Russia's northern Murmansk region say that, unlike the previous meteor, there was no audible explosion when the bright object appeared at roughly 2.10pm local time. The Chelyabinsk meteor, which crashed to Earth in February 2013 weighed 10,000 tonnes, according to scientists, and was 55ft wide. When it exploded the force was so great it sent shockwaves around the world twice before punching a 50ft-wide hole in the surface of a frozen lake. The light flares up, illuminating the surrounding buildings, before disintegrating and fading away . While many believe the object to be a meteor, others have pointed out that the Russian military have a base nearby and have suggested that it could be a missile test . The tremors from the explosion above Chelyabinsk city were recorded at around 20 monitoring stations across the world. The stations are part of the International Monitoring System network operated by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation. Collectors were quick to the scene where . they collected fragments of space rock before trying to sell them . online, some reportedly fetching thousands of pounds. Earlier this year Russia included . fragment of the meteor in medals which they handed out at the Sochi . winter Olympics to mark the anniversary of the rock falling to Earth. A meteor occurs when an object from space, usually rock, gets dragged into the Earth's atomosphere by gravity, burning up as it encounters friction. The clip is similar to dashcam footage captured in 2013 of a meteor exploding above Chelyabinsk . On that occasion a huge explosion blew out glass in surrounding buildings, injuring 1,200 people.

Gathering evidence: Researchers carried out a study of craters at Aeolis Dorsa, a 3.6 billion year old region near the Curiosity rover landing site.

But if the atmosphere is thinner, smaller objects . are able to reach the surface. Dr . Edwin Kite, of Princeton University, New Jersey, said that whether a . meteoroid survives transit through the Martian . atmosphere and forms a crater depends on the . density of the air it must penetrate. Ready to launch: Planetary experts analysed high resolution digital images of 319 small craters taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (pictured) Therefore, the size of the smallest craters in Mars's river deposits yields . information of the atmospheric pressure on the planet at around the time the rivers . flowed. Dr Kite said: 'The . minimum size of craters serves as a proxy for ancient pressure of . planetary atmospheres, because thinner atmospheres permit smaller . objects to reach the surface at high velocities and form craters.' Researchers compared the size of the craters to numerous computer . simulations over a range of atmospheric pressures. They concluded the . atmospheric pressure on Mars would have been much greater than it is today - but would have been less than required to warm the surface above . freezing. Instead, the flow of liquid on Mars must have formed . over a relatively short time - not allowing enough time for . the extended warm, wet conditions necessary for life to arise, they said. Dr Kite . said if his researchers' findings are correct, then a dense atmosphere rich in greenhouse gases and water is 'ruled out, and long term average . temperatures [on Mars] were most likely below freezing'.

"By . Nick Mcdermott, Science Reporter . It may not help parents convince their unruly children to eat more greens, but broccoli could hold the key to preventing painful arthritis. A compound found in abundance in the vegetable superfood slows down the destruction of cartilage in joints associated with osteoarthritis, according to a new study. The often debilitating condition affects 8.5 million adults, with no cure or effective treatment other than pain relief or joint replacement. Currently, the NHS performs over 140,000 hip and knee replacement operations each year. An elderly woman with arthritis: the debilitating condition affects 8.5 million adults, with no cure or effective treatment other than pain relief or joint replacement . Scientists from the University of East Anglia found sulforaphane - a chemical found mainly in broccoli but also in Brussels sprouts and cabbage - reduces joint damage. In tests involving mice, those fed a diet rich in the compound suffered significantly less wear to their joints, helping protect against osteoarthritis. Human cartilage cells were also exposed to the chemical and found the genes responsible for cartilage damage were switched off. In a third test, the team observed a protective effect on cow cartilage tissue that was first given sulforaphane. Sulforaphane - a chemical found mainly in broccoli - reduces joint damage, scientists from the University of East Anglia found . Lead researcher Ian Clark, professor of musculoskeletal biology at UEA, said: ‘The results from this study are very promising. We have shown that this works in the three laboratory models we have tried, in cartilage cells, tissue and mice. We now want to show this works in humans. It would be very powerful if we could. ‘As well as treating those who already have the condition, you need to be able to tell healthy people how to protect their joints into the future. There is currently no way in to the disease pharmaceutically and you cannot give healthy people drugs unnecessarily, so this is where diet could be a safe alternative. ‘Although surgery is very successful, it is not really an answer. Once you have osteoarthritis, being able to slow its progress and the progression to surgery is really important. Prevention would be preferable and changes to lifestyle, like diet, may be the only way to do that.’ Aging and obesity are the most common contributors to the condition, with one in five people over the age of 45 suffering with knee osteoarthritis. Brussel sprouts with pancetta: the chemical sulforaphane, found in broccoli, is also found in Brussels sprouts and cabbage . And it is predicted the number of people seeking treatment will almost double in the next 20 years. The research, published in the journal Arthritis & Rheumatism, found that more than three-quarters of mice eating the sulforaphane-rich diet showed a reduction in cartilage damage compared to those on a control diet. The team will now undertake on a small scale trial of human patients with knee osteoarthritis who are due to have surgery to see if the eating broccoli has a beneficial effect on their joint health. Earlier studies have linked sulforaphane to breast cancer prevention. It has been found to target the cells that fuel the growth of tumours, preventing the cancer from developing, or spreading when it is established. The chemical may also help to reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke by boosting the body’s defence system to keep arteries unclogged. Alan Silman, Arthritis Research UK’s medical director, said: ‘This is an interesting study with promising results as it suggests that a common vegetable, broccoli, might have health benefits for people with osteoarthritis and even possibly protect people from developing the disease in the first place. ‘Until now research has failed to show that food or diet can play any part in reducing the progression of osteoarthritis, so if these findings can be replicated in humans, it would be quite a breakthrough. ‘We know that exercise and keeping to a healthy weight can improve people’s symptoms and reduce the chances of the disease progressing, but this adds another layer in our understanding of how diet could play its part.’","A chemical found mainly in broccoli but also in Brussels sprouts and cabbage reduces joint damage .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Asteroid and comet impacts can cause widespread ecological havoc, killing off plants and animals on regional, and even global, scales. But new research from Brown University shows that impacts can also preserve the signatures of ancient life at the time of an impact. The find also suggests that molten glass created when an asteroid or comet hits a planet could be a good place to look for signs of ancient life on other planets, including Mars. New research has shown that glass created during a searing asteroid impact can actually trap microscopic signs of life for millions of years. Electron microscope images of cellular structures preserved in 'impact amber' are pictured . A research team led by Brown geologist Pete Schultz found fragments of leaves and preserved organic compounds lodged inside glass created by a several ancient impacts in Argentina. The material could provide a snapshot of environmental conditions at the time of those impacts. Bits of plant life encapsulated in molten glass by asteroid and comet impacts millions of years ago give geologists information about climate and life forms on ancient Earth. Scientists exploring large fields of impact glass in Argentina suggest that what happened on Earth might well have happened on Mars millions of years ago. The scorching heat produced by asteroid or comet impacts can melt tons of soil and rock, some of which forms glass as it cools. The soil of eastern Argentina, south of Buenos Aires, is rife with impact glass created by at least seven different impacts that occurred between 6,000 and 9 million years ago, according to Schultz. One of those impacts, dated to around 3 million years ago, coincides with the disappearance of 35 animal genera. Above is a 3D scanning electron microscope animation of preserved leaves similar to those at asteroid sites . Bizarre tubular structures thought to be created when microbes drilled through impact glass following an asteroid strike are pictured here . A separate group spotted the bizarre tubular features in meteorite-created glass at a crater in Germany . 'We know these were major impacts because of the shocked minerals trapped inside with plant materials,' Schultz said. 'These glasses are present in different layers of sediment throughout an area about the size of Texas.' Water flowed on the surface of Mars as recently as 200,000 years ago, new research suggests. A young crater in the red planet's southern hemisphere contains well-preserved gullies and sediment deposits thought to have been formed by water. Scientists studying the crater estimated it to be no more than about 200,000 years old, so the water features must have appeared since then, the scientists claim. The crater formed long after the most recent proposed ice age on Mars, which ended some 400,000 years ago. This could provide evidence that life was able to survive on the red planet. Within glass associated with two of those impacts - one from 3 million years ago and one from 9 million years ago - Schultz and his colleagues found exquisitely preserved plant matter. 'These glasses preserve plant morphology from macro features all the way down to the micron scale,' Schultz continued. 'It’s really remarkable.' The glass samples contain centimetre-sized leaf fragments, including intact structures like papillae, tiny bumps that line leaf surfaces. Bundles of vein-like structures found in several samples are very similar to modern pampas grass, a species common to that region of Argentina. Chemical analysis of the samples also revealed the presence of organic hydrocarbons, the chemical signatures of living matter. To understand how these structures and compounds could have been preserved, Schultz and his colleagues tried to replicate that preservation in the lab. They mixed pulverized impact glass with fragments of pampas grass leaves and heated the mixture at various temperatures for various amounts of time. The experiments showed that plant material was preserved when the samples were quickly heated to above 1,500ºC (1,700°F). It appears, Schultz said, that water in the exterior layers of the leaves insulates the inside layers, allowing them to stay intact. 'The outside of the leaves takes it for the interior.' 'It’s a little like deep frying. The outside fries up quickly but the inside takes much longer to cook.' The tubular features reveal more about the microbial ecosystem in the residual asteroid debris . If impact glass can preserve the signatures of life on Earth, it stands to reason that it could do the same on Mars, according to Schultz. And the soil conditions in Argentina that contributed to the preservation of samples in this study are not unlike soils found on Mars. The Pampas region of Argentinam for example, is covered with thick layers of windblown sediment called loess. Schultz believes that when an object impacts this sediment, globs of melted material roll out from the edge of the impact area like molten snowballs. Craters on Surface of Mars, taken by Viking 1, with impact craters clearly seen where asteroids have hit the planet. Based on the new research they could be prime places to look for signs of ancient life . As they roll, they collect material from the ground and cool quickly - the dynamics that the lab experiments showed were important for preservation. After the impact, those glasses are slowly covered over as dust continues to accumulate. That helps to preserve both the glasses and the stowaways within them for long periods, which in the Argentine case was millions of years. Much of the surface of Mars is covered in a loess-like dust, and the same mechanism that preserved the Argentine samples could also work on Mars. 'Impact glass may be where the 4 billion-year-old signs of life are hiding,' Schultz said. 'On Mars they’re probably not going to come out screaming in the form of a plant, but we may find traces of organic compounds, which would be really exciting.'","Research suggests asteroid impacts can preserve life signatures .

Norma Leake from Penarth called for an ambulance after her husband Raymond, who is unsteady on his feet, fell in the shower and damaged his shoulder. An ambulance took him to the University Hospital of Wales at 9.30am, but he was still waiting outside accident and emergency in an ambulance at 1.15pm, three hours later. Deadly: The University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff is one of those with high death rates . A source from the hospital, who asked not to be named, reported seeing 12 ambulances waiting outside the accident and emergency ward at 3pm, a couple of hours after Mr Leake was dropped off. The family were outraged after they had seen their elderly and ill father wait for a number of hours to receive treatment. Mr Leake's son Andrew, 57, from Chester, said: 'It is unbelievable that, in this day and age, we treat old people like that. 'I am really angry about the situation. Is this really the way our country treats its senior citizens?' The hospital responded by highlighting the busy conditions of the hospital at the time. They said the emergency unit was experiencing significantly a high number of calls, and so they were unable to help as quickly as they would have liked. They also pointed out that large numbers of call outs, combined with many people walking in to A&E to receive treatment, had clogged up the emergency ward. The University Hospital said they were experiencing unusually high numbers of calls at the time of Mr Leake's hospital visit . Alice Casey, chief operating officer for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: 'The Emergency Unit at UHW has been under significant pressure over the last few days. 'Staff have been caring for a high volume of acutely ill people brought in by ambulance coupled with large numbers of members of the public self-referring for treatment.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Seeing the International Space Station from Earth isn’t easy. The football pitch-sized station orbits at a height of 260 miles (420km), appearing as small as a distant star when we gaze at the night sky. But photographer Andy Smith has captured incredible images that show the station’s silhouette crossing the moon during its orbit of Earth. Scroll down for video . Can you see it? While looking to photograph the pink moon expected to be seen in the skies over England, photographer Andy Smith caught the International Space Station (slightly down and right from the middle) passing in front of the full moon . You might think the ISS is quite far above the surface of Earth. But compared to the moon, its just a stone’s throw away. The moon is on average about 239,000 miles (384,000 kilometres) from our planet, over 900 times further than the ISS. In terms of size, the ISS is dwarfed again. The space station is 358 feet (109 metres) wide, 239 feet (72.8 metres) long and about 66 feet (20 metres) high - the same as a standard football pitch. Andy Smith was trying to photograph a so-called 'blood moon' when he took these images. The striking red moon, which occurs relatively rarely, was most visible across North and South America. It looks red because Earth's atmosphere scatters the sun's red light as the moon passes into our planet's shadow, called the umbra. It's the same process that makes the sky appear red at sunset. Inside there is a pressurised liveable space comparable to a six-bedroom house. The moon, by comparison, has a radius of about 1,079 miles (1,737 kilometres) - equivalent to 0.273 Earths. Considering these distances and sizes, the fact that we can see the ISS silhouetted against the moon is incredible. It’s all the more stunning that we can make out some of its features. On either side of the silhouette you can see the vast solar arrays of the station - four on each side - that generate 84 kilowatts of power. And in the centre is the core of the station where the crew of up to six astronauts and cosmonauts reside. Currently on board the ISS as members of Expedition 39 are three Russian cosmonauts, two American astronauts and one Japanese astronaut, Koichi Wakata, who is also serving as the first Japanese commander of the station. The ISS might seem huge to us, but compared to the moon it's just a tiny silhouette . Zoomed up close you can see a remarkable amount of detail on the football pitch-sized ISS, including the two huge solar arrays on either side .

This photo shows debris flowing on Mars (top and bottom left). The Martian landforms were shown to be similar to  known debris flows on the Norwegian Svalbard islands in the Arctic Ocean (bottom right) The crater formed long after the most recent proposed ice age on Mars, which ended some 400,000 years ago. ‘Gullies are common on Mars but the ones which have been studied previously are older, and the sediments where they have formed are associated with the most recent ice age,’ said lead scientist Dr Andreas Johnsson, from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. ‘Our study crater on Mars is far too young to have been influenced by the conditions that were prevalent then. The crater formed long after the most recent proposed ice age on Mars, which ended some 400,000 years ago. This is an artist's impression of what a lake on Mars may have looked like . Evidence of water on Mars dates back to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived in 1971. It revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs. Viking orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars by showing how floods broke through dams and carved deep valleys. Mars is currently in the middle of an ice age, so liquid water cannot exist on its surface at the present time. However, the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the past. In June last year, Curiosity found Powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on Mars. In September, the first scoop of soil analysed by Curiosity revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight. ‘This suggests that the melt water-related processes that formed these deposits have been exceptionally effective also in more recent times.’ The crater had features that were characteristic of debris flows on Earth caused by material being carried and then deposited by fast-moving water. The Martian landforms were compared with known debris flows on the Norwegian Svalbard islands in the Arctic Ocean. ‘Our fieldwork on Svalbard confirmed our interpretation of the Martian deposits,’ said Dr Johnsson, whose findings appear in the scientific journal Icarus. ‘What surprised us was that the crater in which these debris flows have formed is so young.’ The study crater is located in the mid-latitudes of the Martian southern hemisphere and superimposed on the ‘rampart ejecta’ of a nearby larger crater. Rampart ejecta, which display flower-like features, are believed to be the result of a meteor impact on wet or icy ground. The scientists first thought the recent water flow features had come from preserved ice within the rampart ejecta. However, structures such as faults or fractures that could have acted as conduits for the melt water were missing. ‘It is more likely that the water has come from melting snow packs, when the conditions were favourable for snow formation,’ said Dr Johnsson. ‘This is possible since the orbital axis of Mars was more tilted in the past than it is today.’ Evidence of water on Mars dates back . to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived in 1971.

This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it appears red. This gives rise to its ‘blood red’ appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic. When the moon first enters the Earth's partial shadow, know as the penumbra, a dark shadow begins to creep across the moon. This gives the illusion that the moon is changing phases in a matter of minutes instead of weeks. At the eclipse's peak, the moon enters the Earth's full shadow; the umbra. At this stage, the Earth's atmosphere scatters the sun's red visible light; the same process that turns the sky red at sunset. As a result, the red light reflects off the moon's surface, casting a reddish rust hue over it. It's not often that we get a chance to see our planet's shadow, but a lunar eclipse gives us a fleeting glimpse. During these rare events, the full moon rapidly darkens and then glows red. At the eclipse's peak the moon entered the Earth's full shadow, the umbra. At this stage, the Earth's atmosphere scattered the sun's red visible light - the same process that turns the sky red at sunset. As a result, the red light reflected off the moon's surface, casting a reddish rust hue over it. 'It's a projection of all the Earth's sunsets and sunrises onto the moon,' Mr Petro said. The moon is seen as it nears a total lunar eclipse in Venice, California. People across North ad South America were able to witness the first of four in a rare Tetrad of eclipses over the next two years . An airliner crosses the moon's path above Whittier, California approximately one hour before the total lunar eclipse, which some people believe signifies the beginning of a number of significant religious event . Other-worldly: The incredible view from the Spanish Canary Island of Tenerife . Illuminating: The moon glows orange, as seen from Milwaukee in the USA . 'It's a very subtle effect, and if any part of the moon is illuminated in the sun, you can't really see it.' 'They don't happen all the time, and the sky has to be clear. It really gives you a chance to look at the moon changing.' However, some believe the eclipse has larger significance. John Hagee, a Christian pastor who has . written a book on the Tetrad called 'Four Blood Moons: Something is . About to Change' told the Daily Express that last night marked the dawn of a 'hugely significant event' for the world. 'This is not something that some religious think tank has put together,' the notoriously outspoken church founder said. 'Nasa has confirmed that the Tetrad has only happened three times in more than 500 years — and that it's going to happen now.' Taking in the view: Astronomers in North and South America are thought to be viewing the blood moon from 2.06 EST (7.06 GMT) to around 4.24 EST (9.24 GMT). Here, people watch the 'blood moon' rising over the water in Melbourne, Australia . No show: The total eclipse is visible over most of North America, but not in most of Europe, Africa and Asia, as explained by this map . Nasa has confirmed the Tetrad started on . Tuesday night and will end on September 28, 2015. Tetrads are a relatively frequent occurrence in the 21st century, with nine sets in total, but this has not always been the case. From 1600 to 1900, for example, there were none at all. The Book of Joel in the King James Bible prophesied about the blood moons and the end of the world: 'The . sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the . great and the terrible day of the Lord comes.' According to Mr Hagee, each time the Tetrad has happened during that time, there has been a significant religious event accompanied with it. The unusual alignment of the sun, Earth and Mars happened a week before the beginning of the astrological event that some believe is associated with the end of the world . In 1493, the first Tetrad saw the expulsion of Jews by the Catholic Spanish Inquisition. The . second happened in 1949, right after the State of Israel was founded and the most recent one - in 1967 - happened during the Six-Day War . between Arabs and Israelis. Mr Hagee said the first of the blood moons  takes place right in the middle of the Jewish holiday of Passover. The second, on October 8, occurs during the Feast of the Tabernacle and the third will be on April 4, 2015, also during Passover. The final one happens on September 28, 2015, which is also during the Feast of the Tabernacles.","Last night marked first of four blood moons, followed by six full moons .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Nasa chiefs have said that sending a manned mission to Mars is 'necessary if the human race is to survive'. But the huge amounts of chemical rocket fuel needed to complete such a mission would require deep pockets – the launch costs alone would be more than $12 billion (£7 billion). Added to this is the time it takes. The space agency estimates that a round-trip human expedition to Mars would take more than four years using current technology. A concept image of a spacecraft powered by a fusion-driven rocket. The crew would be in the forward-most chamber. Solar panels on the sides would collect energy to initiate the process that creates fusion . Rocket-powered fusion, however, could one day allow 30- and 90-day expeditions to Mars by making the trip more practical and less costly, experts claim. Scientists envision using a nuclear reactor to heat hydrogen to very high temperatures, which will then expand through a spacecraft’s nozzle to generate thrust. Recent advances in manipulating nuclear fusion could means that astronauts are now a step closer to our nearest planetary neighbour. ‘Using existing rocket fuels, it’s nearly impossible for humans to explore much beyond Earth’ said lead researcher John Slough. ‘We are hoping to give us a much more powerful source of energy in space that could eventually lead to making interplanetary travel commonplace.’ The fusion driven rocket test chamber at the University of Washington Plasma Dynamics Lab in Redmond. The green vacuum chamber is surrounded by two large, high-strength aluminum magnets. These magnets are powered by energy-storage capacitors. These store energy electrostatically in an electric field . Nasa is developing the capabilities needed to capture an asteroid by 2015 and send humans to Mars by 2030 . Only a small amount of fusion is needed to power a rocket – a small grain of sand of this material has the same energy content as 1 gallon of rocket fuel. The research team at Washington University developed a type of plasma that is encased in its own magnetic field. Nuclear fusion occurs when this plasma is compressed to high pressure with a magnetic field. The team successfully tested this technique in the lab. ‘I think everybody was pleased to see confirmation of the principal mechanism that we’re using to compress the plasma,’ said Professor Slough. Russia . currently has used over 30 fission reactors in space, the U.S has flown . only one - the SNAP-10A (System for Nuclear Auxiliary Power) in 1965. But there have been several attempts by the U.S. to develop the technology. For instance, the Nerva project . focused on nuclear power replacing chemical rockets for the latter . stages of launches. Nerva used graphite-core reactors heating hydrogen . and expelling it through a nozzle. Another . early idea was U.S. Project Orion, which would launch a 1000 tonnes using . a series of small nuclear explosions to propel it. The project was . aborted in 1963 when the Atmospheric Test Ban Treaty made it illegal. The Orion idea is still under consideration but using another means of . generating the thrust needed. Speaking at the Humans to Mars summit in Washington, head of the U.S. space programme Charles Bolden, said: 'If this species is to survive indefinitely we need to become a multi-planet species' ‘We hope we can interest the world with the fact that fusion isn’t always 40 years away and doesn’t always cost $2 billion.’ Nuclear fusion may draw concern because of its application in nuclear bombs, but its use in this scenario is very different, Professor Slough said. The fusion energy for powering a rocket would be reduced by a factor of 1 billion from a hydrogen bomb, too little to create a significant explosion. Nasa has already successfully tested other power conversion and radiator systems for a nuclear power system it hopes to deploy on the Moon by 2020. Meanwhile, Russia is working on a nuclear rocket that would generate electricity for a plasma thruster.","Nasa envisions using a nuclear reactor to heat hydrogen to create thrust .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Nasa’s robotic moon explorer, Ladee, took a death dive into the lunar surface last night. The orbiting spacecraft crashed into the moon while travelling at speeds of 3,600 mph (5,800 kph) - fast enough to be vapourised by the impact. No debris would have been left behind, but project scientist Rick Elphic predicted: ‘It's bound to make a dent.' Nasa's small moon-orbiting spacecraft Ladee is no more. Flight controllers confirmed today that it crashed into the moon while travelling at speed of 3,600 mph (5,800 kph) - fast enough to be vapourised by the impact . By yesterday evening, the spacecraft had been skimming the lunar surface at an incredibly low altitude of 300 feet (100 metres). Its orbit had been lowered on purpose last week to ensure a crash by Monday following a successful science mission. Ladee - short for Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer - was launched in September from Virginia. From the outset, Nasa planned to crash the spacecraft into the of the moon, far from the Apollo artefacts left behind during the moonwalking days of 1969 to 1972. In this Nasa illustration, dust scatters light during the lunar sunset as Ladee orbits the moon. By yesterday evening, the spacecraft had been skimming the lunar surface at an incredibly low altitude of 300 ft (100m) Launch: Sept. 6, 2013 . Launch site: Wallops Flight Facility, Virgina . Launch vehicle: Minotaur V . Planned mission duration: 100 days . Actual mission duration: 128 days . Mass: 844 lbs (383 kg) Power: 295 watts . Cost: £167 million ($280 million) Mission legacy: Ladee identified various components of . the thin lunar atmosphere. It also studied the dusty veil surrounding the moon, created by all the . surface particles kicked up by impacting micrometeorites. Scientists hope to use the data to address a long-standing question: was lunar dust, electrically charged by sunlight, responsible for the pre-sunrise glow seen above the lunar horizon during several Apollo missions? Ladee also hosted Nasa’s first dedicated system for two-way communication using laser instead of radio waves. It completed its primary 100-day science mission last month and was on overtime. The extension had Ladee flying during Tuesday morning's lunar eclipse; its instruments were not designed to endure such prolonged darkness and cold. But the small spacecraft survived - it's about the size of a vending machine - with just a couple pressure sensors acting up. The mood in the control centre at Nasa’s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, was upbeat yesterday afternoon, according to project manager Butler Hine. ‘Having flown through the eclipse and survived, the team is actually feeling very good,’ Mr Hine told the Associated Press in a phone interview. But the uncertainty of the timing of Ladee’s demise had the flight controllers ‘on edge,’ he said. As it turns out, Ladee succumbed within several hours of Mr Hine's comments. Nasa announced its end early this morning. It will be at least a day or two before Nasa knows precisely where the spacecraft ended up; the data cutoff indicates it smashed into the far side of the moon, although just barely. Engineers prepare to install Ladee spacecraft into the fairing of the Minotaur V launch vehicle nose-cone. The probe was launched in September from Virginia . Ladee did not have enough fuel to remain in lunar orbit much beyond the end of its mission. It joined dozens if not scores of science satellites and Apollo programme spacecraft parts that have slammed into the moon's surface, on purpose, over the decades. Until Ladee, the most recent man-made impacts were the LCROSS crater-observing satellite that went down in 2009 and the twin Grail spacecraft in 2012. During its £167 million ($280 million) mission, Ladee identified various components of the thin lunar atmosphere - neon, magnesium and titanium, among others - and studied the dusty veil surrounding the moon, created by all the surface particles kicked up by impacting micrometeorites. Ladee also hosted Nasa’s first dedicated system for two-way communication using laser instead of radio waves. ‘Ladee’s science cup really overfloweth,’ Mr Elphic said earlier this month. ‘Ladee, by going to the moon, has actually allowed us to visit other worlds with similar tenuous atmospheres and dusty environments.’ During its £167m ($280m) mission, Ladee identified various components of the thin lunar atmosphere .","Spacecraft made a planned crash while travelling at 3,600 mph (5,800 kph)

The Moroccan woman at the center of a sex scandal involving former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi has testified in court for the first time, describing how a young woman attending one of Berlusconi's 'bunga bunga' parties dressed up like a nun, danced provocatively and stripped down to her underwear for the premier. Karima el-Mahroug took the witness stand in the trial of three former Berlusconi aides charged with recruiting her and other women for prostitution. They deny the charges.

Questioned: Karima El Mahrough appeared in court in a previous trial in Milan. But Berlusconi's team eventually dropped her from the witness list after she failed to show on a couple of occasions in the current trial . Karima el-Mahroug took the witness stand in the trial of three former Berlusconi aides charged with recruiting her and other women for prostitution . El-Mahroug's testimony Friday . confirmed the sexual atmosphere at Berlusconi's infamous 'bunga bunga' parties, which were filled with beautiful young women. The trial is separate from the one in which Berlusconi is charged with paying for sex with a minor and trying to cover it up . Many of those women have said they received money from the billionaire media mogul. Dressed soberly with her hair pulled . back,El-Mahroug said she first made contact with Berlusconi's inner . circle when she participated in a beauty contest organized by Fede in . Sicily when she was 16. After that she made her way to Milan, . hoping to find work. She said she tried to get work through another . defendant's talent agency but wound up landing a job as a hostess in . nightclubs, earning around 100 euros a night. Eventually, she ran into Fede at a restaurant, where she reminded him of his promise in Sicily to help her. Shortly thereafter, she was invited to a dinner party - at Berlusconi's villa outside of Milan. She testified that she met the premier . that night - on Valentine's Day in 2010 - and that he gave her an . envelope of 2,000 to 3,000 euros, saying it was 'a little help' and . asking for her telephone number, which she gave him. At that party, she said, she . introduced herself as Ruby and told other guests a fake tale that she . was Egyptian, that her mother was a famous Arab singer and that she was . related to then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. She was 17 at the time . but had passed herself off as being 24. Party girl: Austrian entrepreneur Richard Lugner dancing with Ruby at the traditional Vienna Opera Ball in 2011 . El-Mahroug confirmed Friday what other . witnesses have testified previously: that at some of the soirees, young . female party guests had dressed up like nuns and danced for Berlusconi . and then stripped down to their underwear. El-Mahroug said Minetti, one of the . defendants, had dressed up like a nun at that February 14 party and . lifted her costume to show off her legs as she danced in Berlusconi's . in-house disco, which was outfitted with a lap-dance pole. El-Mahroug demonstrated from her seat . how Minetti had raised her hemline. She said Minetti eventually took off . her costume and was in just her lingerie. She said other girls dressed up as . President Barack Obama and a Milan magistrate who is leading the . prosecution against Berlusconi in the sex scandal. The showgirl Marystelle Polanco dressed up in an Obama mask with a shirt and pants on and performed a dance. 'The girls who were dressed in . costumes approached him in a sensual way as they danced. They raised . their skirts,' El-Mahroug testified. She added: 'I never saw contact.' El-Mahroug said she visited . Berlusconi's mansion, Arcore, a half-dozen times, and that each time she . was given an envelope with money, always in 500 euro bills. The second . evening she went she said she was given around 2,000 euros. Exotic dancer: Bunga Bunga party girl Ruby the Heartstealer aka Karima El Mahroug testified that at least woman at a Berlusconi party was dressed up as Barack Obama . Prosecutors in Berlusconi's separate . trial have said El-Mahroug's testimony is unreliable and are relying on . her sworn statements. The defense had initially called her . as a witness, but then changed its strategy and didn't call her. That . trial is nearing a verdict. Last week photos of the Italian Prime . Minister's underground Bunga Bunga room were revealed as the trial for . having sex with underage prostitutes carried on. The infamous room was allegedly used . to hold erotic parties at which women performed stripteases and were . paid for sex, though Berlusconi denies that it was used for anything so . risque. At the time Miss El Mahroug, also known as Ruby the Heartstealer, was just 17 and technically a minor. In Italy the age of consent is 14, but paying a woman under the age of 18 for sex is seen as a criminal offence. Berlusconi and Miss El Mahroug have . always insisted nothing untoward happened at the parties and he has also . stressed they were nothing more than elegant dinners - a claim he . returned to in his TV interview given to Canale 5 one of the channels . the media tycoon owns. He has always insisted he is the the . victim of left leaning prosecutors and judges who are politically . motivated and out to get him in the various trials he has faced, which . have cost him millions of Euros in legal fees. At the last count there had been more . than 2,500 court hearings against him in which he was accused of crimes . ranging from Mafia collusion, false accounting, tax fraud, bribery, . corruption and perverting the course of justice. So far none have actually ended with . him being convicted indefinitely - in Italy a verdict is not final until . it has reached the third and final stage at the Supreme Court in Rome. Earlier this month a conviction for . tax fraud was upheld against him and this now passes to the Supreme . Court which will rule if the four year jail sentence should be enforced. In the Milan trial he is currently . involved in, Berlusconi is accused of paying for sex with a minor and . abuse of office, as prosecutors claim he told police Miss El Mahroug was . related to former Egyptian president Hosni Mubrak and should be . released after she was arrested on a theft charge.

The descent was so dangerous that the pilot had to declare a medical emergency. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The flight experienced severe turbulence as it was descending towards Billings, Montana . Passenger Bill Dahlin spoke of hearing people scream and of hearing a woman call out for her baby . The Federal Aviation Administration said the pilot, 'declared a medical emergency after a flight attendant was injured by turbulence. The plane landed in Billings without incident.' A United Airlines spokeswoman said the airline would do all that it could to investigate the incident so that it does not occur again. 'Our primary focus is assisting our employees and passengers who were injured, and our flight safety team will review what happened,' the spokeswoman said. CNN reports that there were 114 passengers on board and five crew members. Two passengers and three flight attendants were taken to the hospital and all were treated and released except for one flight attendant. Passenger Bill Dahlin spoke to KTVQ about the frightening experience. 'There was a lot of screaming, a lot of hollering,' Dahlin told the station. 'I was scared,' said passenger Grant who was traveling with his mother Laurel . He said that passengers were surprised by the sudden drop and that the crew was equally troubled. 'I think they were somewhat panicked,' said Dahlin. 'I think they were trying to assess things themselves so they really didn't offer any explanation because of what happened so quickly,' he continued. He explained how one female hit the ceiling of the plane so hard that it cracked. 'I have flown a lot, and I do know you run into things like this,' Dahlin said.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . In 2010 astronomers were baffled when they found a supernova 30 times brighter than it should have been. Named PS1-10afx it was identical to similar types of supernova save for its intense brightness, leaving scientists wondering if their models were wrong. But new observations suggest it may not have been a ‘super-supernova’ at all, but rather its brightness was magnified by a hidden lens galaxy that has now recently discovered. Astronomers have revealed that a supernova 30 times brighter than it should have been may have been an illusion caused by a lens galaxy. Pictured is a Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope (CFHT) image of the field . Type 1a supernovas, caused when a large star transfers material to a white dwarf until it explodes, are useful tools for understanding the universe. This is because they have similar luminosities regardless of where they occur in the universe, meaning they can be used as ‘distance markers’. So when PS1-10afx was found to break those previous theories, it had astronomers worried they had been wrong about the supernovas. This particular supernova occurred nine billion light years away, and shone with an intensity of 100 billion suns. Type Ia: A white dwarf accumulates material from a stellar companion until it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion and explodes. Non-standard type 1a: Two white dwarfs merge until their combined mass causes an explosion. Type II: A star at least nine times the mass of the sun eventually experiences a core collapse as its fuel runs out, causing it to explode. Type 1b and 1c: A star undergoes core collapse but most of its outer hydrogen has already been lost to stellar winds. Hypernova: Extreme type of supernova, 50 times as energetic as other supernovas, resulting in a black hole. The exact cause of them is unknown. In 2013, scientists at Harvard concluded it must be a type of new, significantly brighter class of supernova. But a new study in Science suggests it is nothing more than an average supernova, amplified by an intervening galaxy. The study was carried out by a team of researchers led by Robert Quimby at the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (Kavli IPMU). On analysis of the supernova, they weren’t so quick to agree with their compatriots at Harvard that it was a super-supernova. ‘PS1-10afx looked a lot like a Type 1a supernova,’ says Quimby, ‘but it was just too bright.’ Generally, when a supernova is found to be brighter than a regular Type 1a supernova it is either hotter, appearing blue, or involves a much larger initial size. ‘New physics would thus be required to explain PS1-10afx as an intrinsically luminous supernova,’ continues Quimby. The observed spectra of the lensing galaxy (left) and host galaxy containing the original supernova (right), as measured by the Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrograph on the 10-metre Keck-1 telescope, suggesting that the lensing galaxy was responsible for the extreme brightness of the supernova . Instead, the scientists believed that it was nothing more than an illusion and that a hidden galaxy was altering what we were seeing. So in September 2013 they spent seven hours collecting light at the location of PS1-10afx using the . Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrograph on the 10-metre Keck-1 telescope in Hawaii.In the glare of the galaxy containing PS1-10afx they found another galaxy, much dimmer, but of the right size to cause the lensing effect. ‘This second galaxy was faint enough to have previously gone unnoticed,’ says Anupreeta More, Astronomer at the Kavli IMPU. ‘But our analysis showed that it was still the right size to explain the gravitational lensing of PS1-10afx.’ Gravitational lensing occurs when a large, massive object like a galaxy bends the light of a distant source. The . light from the distant source is gathered by the intervening galaxy . and, when we finally see it on Earth, it appears amplified. The . effect was first predicted by Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity – . now, this discovery serves as another validation of the theory. Gravitational lensing is an effect that occurs when a massive intervening object magnifies light from a distant source. The effect is highlighted by an 'Einstein ring', pictured, where light is bent around a lensing object . Such lensing galaxies for Type 1a supernovas had been predicted before, but none had been found. However, this discovery could lead to similar lensing galaxies being found in future. ‘We had existing predictions of what a gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernova would look like,’ says Masamune Oguri from the Department of Physics at the University of Tokyo. ‘But the small size of this lens galaxy and the large magnification it produced was not exactly what we were expecting for the first discovery. ‘However, this system may very well prove typical of discoveries to come. 'Because more distant supernovae are more likely to be gravitationally lensed, lensed supernovae are typically highly magnified and located in the distant universe. ‘Our new approach allows us to find unresolved strong lensing events produced by such low-mass galaxies. ‘Thus, the expected number of gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae to be found in future surveys increases by an order of magnitude.’","An extremely bright supernova spotted in 2010 may have been an illusion .

Google revealed Thursday its 11th annual Zeitgeist – the people, places, culture, and most-searched terms that shaped 2011. In the U.S., Rebecca Black- the teenager whose catchy hit Friday garnered millions of hits, late night talk show appearances, and even a record deal - was the most popular search of 2011. Scroll down for video commemorating this year's top searches . Partying, partying: Rebecca Black, who rose to fame with her YouTube music video Friday, was the fastest-rising search in 2011 . Surprisingly, Kim Kardashian didn’t rank in the top ten searches in the U.S., though the reality TV star whose marriage to Kris Humphries lasted a brief 72 days. However, she placed second in the top celebrity search ranking. The remainder of the top ten searches reflected a mix of current events, technology, and entertainment – Google’s answer to social networking behemoth Facebook Google+ came in second. Apple was big in the top ten fastest rising searches, with not one but three searches, including iPhone 5, Steve Jobs, and iPad2. Joyous occasion: The wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton was one of the biggest searches on Google this year . Hurricane Irene – one of the most destructive and deadliest hurricanes to hit the U.S. since 1980 – ranked third. The storm killed at least 23 people on its destructive route along the eastern seaboard. Year of Apple: Steve Jobs, iPhone 5 and iPad 2 topped the list of Google searches . More than 5.8million people lost electricity, while flooding destroyed roadways and homes of thousands. Casey Anthony, the 25-year-old Florida woman charged – and later acquitted – of murdering her two-year-old daughter Caylee, was the seventh most popular. Searches for ‘Casey Anthony’ and related searches like ‘Casey Anthony Case’ grew 2,680 per cent from 2010 to 2011, according to Google. On a lighter note, the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton was one of the most popular wedding searches of the year, as was the Kardashian wedding.

"By . Associated Press . A North Dakota judge sentenced a white supremacist today to four years of probation but no additional jail time for terrorizing residents of the small community of Leith, where he tried unsuccessfully to establish an all-white enclave and has left behind a legacy of fear. Craig Cobb, 62, has been jailed since mid-November when he was arrested on seven felony terrorizing counts for scaring residents while patrolling Leith with a gun. He was due to be a free man later on Tuesday after going through the jail release process - a reality that scares officials in Leith. Scroll down for video . Craig Cobb, 62, pictured center last year, has been jailed since mid-November when he was arrested on seven felony terrorizing counts for scaring residents while patrolling Leith with a gun . 'Now we've got this lunatic out on the street again,' City Councilman Lee Cook said after the sentencing. Cobb - who says he is not a violent man - moved to Leith more than two years ago, bought a house and 12 other lots, and encouraged other white supremacists to join him to create a voting majority in the community of about two dozen residents. In August, he publicized his plans to fill the town with other white supremacists and take over the town government. Judge David Reich sentenced Cobb to four years supervised probation but no additional prison time beyond the time served since November. 'The majority of the victim impact statements and victims in this case indicated they were in agreement with the plea agreement,' Reich said of a deal Cobb had struck with Grant County State's Attorney Todd Schwarz. Leith Mayor Ryan Schock, who had wanted a 4-year prison term for Cobb, said outside the court that it would take a long time for the town to recover. 'When are we going to be safe from him? He has made his mark on our lives,' Schock said. Cobb said he now plans to seek permission to move to Missouri to care for his mother. Cobb - who says he is not a violent man - moved to Leith more than two years ago, bought a house and 12 other lots, and encouraged other white supremacists to join him . 'I regret my actions. I know I was wrong and I accept responsibility for my actions. It was an unfortunate confluence of circumstances and bad decisions on my part,' Cobb told the court. Cobb said earlier this month that he plans to 'retire from white nationalism' because he's tired of the spotlight. Cobb had said earlier that he brandished a gun in Leith in response to violence and harassment directed toward him. He no longer owns any property in Leith, and in late February he pleaded guilty to five misdemeanor menacing counts and one felony terrorizing charge. The original charges against Cobb carried a maximum punishment of 30 years in prison. The terms of Cobb's probation bar him from having contact with victims, but Cook, one of the victims in the case, said he had been given no information on where Cobb will be going. He and mayor Schock said they worry whether the town will be safe - especially since Cobb gave three of his Leith lots to white separatist Tom Metzger, National Socialist Movement Commander Jeff Schoep and white supremacist Alex Linder. 'It's a failure of justice,' Cook said. 'This guy gets off. He made our lives a living hell and now he's walking the streets again.' Schwarz said outside the courtroom that he did not know where Cobb would go, but that Cobb would be monitored by GPS. 'If all of a sudden he gets within 500 yards of Leith, he'll be back in jail,' Schwarz said. Schock, Cook and Leith website operator Greg Bruce earlier this month filed a complaint against Schwarz with the state attorney disciplinary board, alleging the prosecutor has acted unprofessionally and possibly unethically. Schwarz believes he handled the case properly and said Tuesday that he felt justice had been served. Schock and Cook disputed that. Cook said Cobb and Kynan Dutton - a Cobb loyalist who also was arrested in the gun incident and earlier received a similar sentence - 'are not Boy Scouts'. 'They were out looking for a reason to shoot us,' Cook said. 'Just like the guy in Kansas City who gunned down a 14-year-old boy - they're buddies.' Cobb has acknowledged a friendship with Frazier Glenn Cross, who is accused of killing three people at Jewish sites in Kansas earlier this month. Cobb said earlier that he spoke with Cross just three days before the killings but that the allegations against Cross have nothing to do with him.","Craig Cobb, 62, has been jailed since mid-November when he was arrested on seven felony terrorizing counts .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Ancient Earth may have had an extra-terrestrial supply of vitamin B3 delivered by carbon-rich meteorites. This is according to Nasa-funded scientists who have been exploring the potential mix of ingredients brought to the planet from space. The study supports the theory that life on Earth may have been kick-started by a supply of molecules created in space which hitched a ride to the planet on meteorites. Karen Smith crushing meteorites with a mortar and pestle in Goddard's Astrobiology Analytical Laboratory to prepare them for analysis. Vitamin B3 was found in all eight meteorites analysed in the study . While scientists aren't yet sure exactly how these ingredients were cooked up, they predict radiation-blasted ice powered the chemical reactions that produced vitamin B3. ‘Vitamin B3, also called nicotinic acid or niacin, is a precursor to Nad (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), which is essential to metabolism and likely very ancient in origin,’ said Karen Smith of Pennsylvania State University. This isn’t the first time vitamin B3 has been found in meteorites. In 2001 a team led by Sandra Pizzarello of Arizona State University discovered it in the Tagish Lake meteorite. Residue from a laboratory experiment simulating the conditions of interstellar space. The residue contained vitamin B3 (and related compounds) and may help explain meteorite chemistry . A similar study last year found that the building blocks of life can spring into existence spontaneously when icy comets smash into planets. Scientists believe that about the time life first emerged, between 4.5 and 3.8 billion years ago, Earth was being bombarded by comets and meteorites. Writing in the journal Nature Geoscience, Imperial College London scientists show how when a comet impacts it creates a shock wave that generates the molecules needed for amino acids. Heat from the impact then transforms these molecules into the protein building blocks. The scientists point out that abundant ice on the surfaces of Enceladus and Europa, two moons orbiting Saturn and Jupiter, could provide the perfect conditions for producing amino acids from meteor impacts. In the new work at Goddard's Astrobiology Analytical Laboratory, Dr Smith and her team analysed samples from eight different carbon-rich meteorites and found vitamin B3 at levels ranging from about 30 to 600 parts-per-billion. ‘We discovered a pattern – less vitamin B3 (and other pyridine carboxylic acids) was found in meteorites that came from asteroids that were more altered by liquid water,’ she said. ‘One possibility may be that these molecules were destroyed during the prolonged contact with liquid water. Asteroids and comets are considered more or less pristine remnants from our solar system's formation, and many meteorites are prized samples from asteroids that happen to be conveniently delivered to Earth. When asteroids collide with meteoroids or other asteroids, pieces break off and some of them eventually make their way to Earth as meteorites . Although meteorites are valued samples from asteroids, they are rarely recovered immediately after they fall to Earth. This leaves them vulnerable to contamination from terrestrial chemistry and life. But the team doubts the vitamin B3 and other molecules found in their meteorites came from terrestrial life. Ancient Earth may have had an extra-terrestrial supply of vitamin B3 delivered by carbon-rich meteorites . This is because the vitamin B3 was found along with its structural isomers – related molecules that have the same chemical formula but whose atoms are attached in a different order. These other molecules aren't used by life. If contamination from terrestrial life was the source of the vitamin B3 in the meteorites, then only the vitamin should have been found, not the other, related molecules. The amount of vitamin B3 found was also related to how much the parent asteroids had been altered by water. Scientists claim this correlation with conditions on the asteroids would be unlikely if the vitamin came from contamination on Earth. The team plans to conduct more interstellar chemistry experiments under more realistic conditions to better understand how vitamin B3 can form on ice grains in space. ‘We want to add water ice (the dominant component of interstellar ices) and start from simpler organic precursors (building-block molecules) of vitamin B3 to help verify our result,’ said Dr Smith.","Nasa predicts radiation-blasted ice produced vitamin B3 on meteors .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Pivoting planets that lean one way and then change direction could be ideal places for alien life to thrive. This is according to a Nasa research team who claim 'wobbling' worlds would expose their surfaces to a more even heat from their suns. The theory suggests that planets further out from their stars - outside what is known as the habitable zone - could be kept from turning into icy worlds. A drunken planet? Tilted orbits might make some planets wobble like a top that's almost done spinning, an effect that could maintain liquid water on the surface . And with some water remaining liquid on the surface long-term, such planets could maintain favourable conditions for life, scientists claim. ‘Planets like these are far enough from their stars that it would be easy to write them off as frozen, and poor targets for exploration, but in fact, they might be well-suited to supporting life,’ said Shawn Domagal-Goldman, a Nasa astrobiologist. ‘This could expand our idea of what a habitable planet looks like and where habitable planets might be found.’ Where are these wobbling worlds? Scientists have already spotted an arrangement of planets where this wobbling effect could happen, in orbit around the star Upsilon Andromedae . Though it might seem far-fetched for a world to experience such see-sawing action, scientists have already spotted an arrangement of planets where this could happen, in orbit around the star Upsilon Andromedae. There, the orbits of two enormous planets were found to be inclined at an angle of 30 degrees relative to each other. Compared to our solar system, that arrangement looks extreme. The orbits of Earth and its seven neighboring planets differ by seven degrees at most. Even the tilted orbit of the dwarf planet Pluto, which really stands out, is offset by a relatively modest 17 degrees. Tilted orbits might make some planets wobble like a top that's almost done spinning - an effect that could maintain liquid water on the surface. The team at the University of Washington, Weber State University and Nasa looked at planets that have the same mass as Earth, orbit a sun-like star and have one or two gas giants orbiting nearby. In some cases, gravitational pulls from those massive planets could change the orientation of the terrestrial world's rotation within tens to hundreds of thousands of years – a blink of an eye in geologic terms. Though it might seem far-fetched for a world to experience such see-sawing action, scientists have already spotted an arrangement of planets where this could happen, in orbit around the star Upsilon Andromedae. Alien life: The theory suggests that planets further out from their stars - outside what is known as the habitable zone - could be kept from turning into icy worlds . ‘Knowing that this kind of planetary system existed raised the question of whether a world could be habitable under such conditions,’ said Rory Barnes, a scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle who was part of the team that studied the orbits of the two Andromedae planets. Earth's history indicates that the amount of sunlight glaciers receive strongly affects how much they grow and melt. Extreme wobbling, like that seen in some models in this study, would cause the poles to point directly at the sun from time to time, melting the glaciers. As a result, some planets would be able to maintain liquid water on the surface despite being located nearly twice as far from their stars as Earth is from the sun. ‘In those cases, the habitable zone could be extended much farther from the star than we normally expect,’ said Professor Armstrong, the lead author of the paper. ‘Rather than working against habitability, the rapid changes in the orientation of the planet could turn out be a real boon sometimes.’","Tilted orbits make planets wobble like a top that's almost done spinning .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Around Saturn lurks a bizarre moon named Iapetus. It’s odd, not just because one side of the planet is light and the other dark, but also because it has a giant ridge running across it. Until now astronomers weren’t sure how this ridge came to be on the moon, but a new study suggests it may have fallen there – from the sky. Did this ridge fall from space? New research suggests a the huge mountainous range (pictured by Cassini) on the Saturnian moon Iapetus may have dropped from the sky . The team of researchers that made the discovery are from Brown University in Rhode Island and the Lunar Planetary Institute in Texas. In their paper they suggest that the mountainous ridge, which runs around the equator of the moon, most likely was not created on the surface. Instead they say it is of exogenic origin, meaning it came from an external source, which may have been a ring system around the moon. Ring systems around moons are almost non-existent, which would make this discovery very interesting. Discovery: 25 October 1671 . Distance from Saturn: 2.2 million miles (3.5 million kilometres) Time taken to orbit Saturn: 79.3 Earth days . Radius: 450 miles (735 kilometres) Speed needed to leave the surface: 1,280 miles (2,000 kilometres) per hour . It has been thought that moons are unable to have their own ring system as the gravity of their host planet is too invasive. Only one moon is known of that may have a ring system: Rhea, another of Saturn’s moons, which orbits far enough away to have such a system. But if it is discovered that Iapetus, too, once had a ring system it could change our understanding of how moons can thrive in their orbits. The latest theory was based on 3D models of the moon, from which the researchers analysed the types of peaks on the ridge. Iapetus is one of Saturn's 62 moons (53 confirmed, nine potential moons) and orbits quite far out when compared to the others. Titan dominates the moons though and is much larger than all the rest combined . Iapetus is unusual because one side is much brighter than the other. The darker surface can be seen starting on the right. The bright hemisphere is the trailing hemisphere in the moon's orbit . The ridge is 12 miles (19 km) high by 12 miles wide and stretches 800 miles (1,300 km) around Iapetus. The 3D model was created using data from the Cassini space probe, which has been operating in the Saturnian system since it arrived in July 2004. The team found most of the peaks sat at their angle of repose, which is the maximum angle that material can rest on a peak without falling to the bottom. Normal geological activity forms shallow peaks with less uniformity, which suggests the mountains were not created via such means but rather were part of a ring of material that once circled the moon. This ring could have been created by a collision of another body with the moon, or by two bodies colliding nearby. The resultant material from the impact would have coalesced around the equator of the moon. Over time this ring could have been dragged to the surface by the moon’s gravity. Supporting this theory, according to the team, is the irregular orbit of Iapetus and the fact it is tidally locked, which means the same face always points towards Saturn. Further research will be needed, though, to truly determine if the intriguing theory is correct. The Cassini spacecraft has been in orbit around Saturn since July 2004. During its mission it has observed many of the moons and also released a lander, Huygens, onto the surface of Titan on Christmas Day 2004 .","New research suggests a mountainous ridge on Iapetus came from the sky .

"By . Emma Innes . A mother who was pregnant with twins has told of her heartache after she had to refuse life-saving treatment for one of them to save the other. Nursery owner Dwynwen Davies, 30, was pregnant with twin girls when one of the children in her care picked up slapped cheek syndrome. Miss Davies did not realise how dangerous the virus is to unborn babies and after picking it up from the child, she passed it on to one of her unborn twins, Martha. Dwynwen Davies, 30, had to make the heart-breaking decision to turn down the offer of potentially lifesaving treatment for one of her twins so as to save the life of the other. She is pictured with the surviving baby, Cadi . Ms Davies was told when she was 28-weeks pregnant that baby Martha had died. Both babies were delivered by C-section seven weeks later. Ms Davies is pictured holding both of them . A blood transfusion that could have . saved Martha could also have killed Cadi so she had to make the . excruciating decision to refuse treatment. Martha died from the virus . and Miss Davies had to deliver her stillborn along with healthy Cadi. When . Cadi was delivered safely by Caesarean section, Miss Davies said it was . ‘bittersweet’. She added: ‘I had two babies but only one was coming . home with me. 'I had Cadi in one arm and Martha in another, it was . heartbreaking to see such a perfect baby who would never have a future.’ The . virus, which causes a rash and cold-like symptoms, is considered fairly . harmless in children. Ms Davies (pictured with Cadi) picked up slapped cheek syndrome when she was pregnant and the virus was passed onto baby Martha. Martha could have been given a blood transfusion but this could have killed Cadi . Miss Davies said: ‘At 12 weeks during a routine . check with my midwife, I mentioned that a child in my care had slapped . cheek syndrome, I knew it could be caught through coughs and sneezes but . I had no idea of the real danger it posed.’ She . said her midwife was not unduly concerned. Slapped cheek syndrome is a viral infection that is most common in children. It usually affects those aged between six and 10 and is most common in late winter and early spring. It causes a bright red rash on the cheeks as well as cold-like symptoms. In most cases, it is mild and clears up without treatment. The infection can be much more serious in some people - such as those with some blood disorders and pregnant women. In pregnant women it is only a problem if they are not already immune to it. In this case, it can cause miscarriage as the virus can cause the baby to develop severe anaemia. However, the overall risk of a miscarriage after developing the infection is thought to be less than five per cent. Source: NHS Choices . Some 60 per cent of adults . are immune to the virus and even if a mother passes it on to a baby, . usually there is only a 5 per cent risk of miscarriage. Miss Davies was . given a blood test and it was discovered she was not immune. However, at that stage nothing could be done as a vaccine would have to have been given before the pregnancy. The syndrome is caused by the parvovirus B19, which can cause severe anaemia in a baby in the womb. Miss Davies prayed the virus would not be passed on but at a 17-week scan, it was discovered in one of the twins, Martha. The virus can make a baby swell up with fluid, which it will eventually choke on. She said: ‘I was then given two scenarios, either my baby would fight . the infection or it would continue to fill up with fluid until the heart . stopped. 'To know that . there was a child drowning inside of me was horrible. 'I felt helpless . in my own body as there was nothing I could do to save her. I just . prayed they’d both make it.’ By . week 24, Martha was critical. Miss Davies, from Lampeter, . Carmarthenshire in south west Wales, said: ‘I was offered a blood . transfusion but because I was having twins it was too risky. ‘I couldn’t risk losing Cadi and doctors couldn’t even guarantee that the transfusion would save Martha. 'I opted against it and trusted the doctors’ advice.’ Ms Davies (pictured with Cadi) says she had to make the decision for the sake of her healthy baby . Ms Davies (pictured with Cadi and her other daughter, Delun) says she had no idea of the dangers of slapped cheek syndrome and she is now trying to raise awareness of the risks . Ms Davies says the twins' birth was a bittersweet experience because she was relieved Cadi (pictured) was healthy but she was grieving for Martha . Miss . Davies, who has a six-year-old daughter called Delun Mair along with . five-month-old Cadi, said: ‘They couldn’t rule out that the virus . wouldn’t attack Cadi too, I was a nervous wreck for the next seven . weeks. ‘I just prayed that . my second baby would survive. Sadly, I was told she had no heart beat at . my 28-week scan, I then had to carry both for another seven weeks. ‘I’m . extremely lucky I have Cadi but that doesn’t ease the pain of losing a . child. I wish I had known the dangers of slapped cheek syndrome while . pregnant. 'I hope by sharing my story other parents will read about the devastating consequences the virus can have.’ Miss Davies has now set up Martha Aur Appeal in her baby’s name to raise awareness of the risks of slapped cheek syndrome. Around 4,000 babies are stillborn in the UK each year. Stillbirth refers to a foetus which dies in the womb sometime after 24 weeks of pregnancy, but before birth. There are several causes of stillbirth, including infections during pregnancy, pre-eclampsia, and congenital abnormality. It is most common to give birth naturally to a stillborn baby unless there are medical reasons for a caesarean and most women have to be induced. Giving birth to a stillborn baby tends to take place withing two to three days of the death of the foetus in the womb. A devastating event, a mother and partner involved in a stillbirth should always receives psychiatric help before and after labour.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Munching just two and a half portions of fruit and vegetables daily may significantly reduce the risk of stroke, new research claims. Stroke risk decreases by 32 per cent with every 200 grams of fruit consumed each day and 11 per cent with every 200 grams of vegetables consumed each day, according to a study. The conclusion came from analysis of 20 studies about the effects of fruit and vegetable consumption on risk of stroke published over the past 19 years. Food for thought: Stroke risk decreases by 32 per cent with every 200 grams of fruit consumed each day and 11 per cent with every 200 grams of vegetables consumed each day . Stroke is a 'brain attack', according to the Stroke Association. Its . website says: 'For your brain to function, it needs a constant blood . supply, which provides vital nutrients and oxygen to the brain cells. A . stroke happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off and . brain cells are damaged or die. 'About . a third of people who have a stroke make a significant recovery within a . month. But most stroke survivors will have long-term problems. It may . take a year or longer for them to make the best possible recovery. Sadly, in the most severe cases, strokes can be fatal or cause long-term . disability.' It says that members of the public can recognise a stroke using the FAST test: . 1) Facial weakness - can the person smile? Has their mouth or eye drooped?2) Arm weakness - Can the person raise both arms?3) Speech problems - Can the person speak clearly and understand what you say?4) Time to call 999. The Stroke Association says that failing any of these tests means it's a medical emergency and it's time to call 999. ‘Improving diet and lifestyle is critical for heart and stroke risk reduction in the general population,’ said Yan Qu, the study's senior author and director of the intensive care unit at Qingdao Municipal Hospital, China. ‘In particular, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is highly recommended because it meets micronutrient and macronutrient and fibre requirements without adding substantially to overall energy requirements.’ The studies demonstrated that high fruit and vegetable consumption can lower blood pressure – high blood pressure is a major cause of strokes - and improve microvascular function. This diet also has favourable effects on body mass index, waist circumference, cholesterol and inflammation, the study said. The beneficial effects of fruits and vegetables applied consistently to men and women of all ages. The NHS recommends eating five 80g portions of fruit and veg daily. The researchers combined the results of six studies from the U.S, eight from Europe and six from China and Japan. They noted that low fruit and vegetable consumption is prevalent worldwide, and especially in low and middle-income countries. Over 150,000 people suffer a stroke every year in the UK and it is the third largest cause of death, with heart disease and cancer being the most deadly conditions, according to the NHS. Strokes are the largest cause of adult disability in the UK, as they can starve the brain of oxygen, leading to permanent damage. Eighty per cent of strokes are the ischaemic variety, where blood supply is curtailed by a blood clot. The other type is haemorrhagic, where a blood vessel connected to the brain bursts. Increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables up to 600 grams each day could reduce the burden of ischemic stroke by 19 percent globally, according to the World Health Organization. A recent study from the University of Eastern Finland, meanwhile, showed that consuming alcohol more frequently than twice a week increases the risk of stroke mortality in men. In China, stroke is the leading cause of death, with an estimated 1.7million people dying in 2010. In the United States, stroke is the No4 cause of death and a leading cause of disability. Brush with death: Chris Tarrant said he felt lucky to be alive after suffering a stroke on a flight from Thailand to Heathrow . Chris Tarrant and Andrew Marr are two recent high-profile stroke victims. Mr Tarrant suffered one during an 11-hour flight from Bangkok to Heathrow. He said afterwards: 'I wasn't sure if I was going to fade away completely on my own. I am incredibly lucky to be alive because one in three people who have strokes don't make it. It has made me appreciate my life so much more.' Results of the study were published in the American Heart Association's journal Stroke.","Stroke risk decreases by 32% with every 200g of fruit consumed each day .

Speaking at the Humans to Mars summit in Washington, head of the U.S. space programme Charles Bolden, said: 'If this species is to survive indefinitely we need to become a multi-planet species' Nasa plans to capture an asteroid by 2015 and take it into the moon's orbit. Astronauts . making the journey to their captive space rock will hitch a ride on the . next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, which will also be . used for trips to the Moon and Mars. Up . to four people can be shuttled to the asteroid, compared to the maximum . three in Apollo, in a trip that utilises both solar power and the . moon’s gravitational pull to power the spacecraft , according to the . video. Once . the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the . crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the . conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take . photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows. Once in orbit, astronauts will be able to visit the space rock using the Orion spacecraft by as early as 2021. Mr Bolden revealed plans for the series of 'stepping stones' to the red planet, which included 'lassoing' an asteroid, The Times reports. It also included growing plants in space, and using 3D printers for onboard repairs. Nasa plans to capture an asteroid by 2015 and take it into the moon's orbit, send a spaceship to it and collect samples before returning home in less than a month round trip. In an effort to attain a better understanding of asteroids, meteors and other near-space objects, the space exploration arm of the U.S. government plans to capture an asteroid, fly a crew to it in a next-generation spacecraft, take samples and return home to a splashdown in the ocean. Nasa is developing the capabilities needed to capture an asteroid by 2015 and send humans to Mars by 2030 . Sending a manned mission to Mars is 'necessary ' if the human race is to survive, Nasa chiefs have said . Funding for the project is included in the space agency’s upcoming budget, and details of the asteroid mission were outlined in a video released by Nasa last year. It revealed that astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock will hitch a ride on the next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, which will also be used for trips to the Moon and Mars. Up to four people can be shuttled to the asteroid, compared to the maximum three in Apollo, in a trip that utilises both solar power and the moon’s gravitational pull to power the spacecraft , according to the video. Once the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows. Using a combination of solar power and gravity-aided thrust, the Orion will make the 10 day trip to the asteroid . Though it bares a resemblance to the earlier Apollo, Orion can hold more crew and is far-more advanced . Once in orbit, astronauts will be able to visit the space rock using the Orion spacecraft by as early as 2021. Once the mission is complete, Orion returns to Earth on the same path it journeyed out on, loop around the moon included, and splashes down in an ocean – likely the Pacific – 10 days later, as seen in the video. Announced in the aftermath of the asteroid that exploded over Russia last year, injuring well over 1,000 people, Nasa plans to dedicate $100 million (£60 million) to this project in the coming year, the agency said.","U.S. space programme launched ambitious plans to land on planet by 2030 .

"By . Leon Watson . An amateur astronomer has discovered a 170 million-year-old dying sun using a homemade telescope set up in his garden shed. Dave Grennan, 42, from Dublin, spotted the star, thought to be 100 times the size of ours, on Good Friday using equipment he built himself. 'It was 11 o'clock at night when I actually got the first look at this and by 1am I was fairly certain and at that time of night there was nothing else for it but a strong cup of tea,' he said. Amateur astronomer Dave Grennan with the telescope he built himself for his Raheny Observatory in Dublin . 'What excites me about this one this time is the telescope - I built it myself, right down to the polishing of the lenses.' Software developer Mr Grennan has discovered three supernovae or exploding stars over four years from a shed at the bottom of his garden. The success rate is all the more significant as Ireland only averages six to 12 clear skies a month and the nights from May to August are too bright to hunt for the celestial phenomenon. The latest discovery was confirmed over the weekend by the International Astronomical Union which gave it the unique name Supernova 2014as. It was made in a galaxy which at this time of year appears beside the constellation known to most people as the Plough, or Big Dipper. 'You won't see any trace of this looking at the night sky with the naked eye, it's about 100,000 times fainter than what you can see,' Mr Grennan said. Dave Grennan (left) and his wife Carol in an observatory in their back garden in Raheny, north Dublin . Mr Grennan, 39, said he was about to finish up a night's stargazing when he spotted the star in the heavens over his home in Raheny, north Dublin . The international astronomy authorities have now officially confirmed Mr Grennan's discovery as a supernova . The stargazer has written a specific computer program with complex algorithms and criteria to allow his telescopes to target certain galaxies at certain times even if he is not in the shed. He then reviews hundreds of images with the naked eye. 'I don't think I could do this if I had kids, but now when I think about it maybe it would be beneficial enough if I was up half the night and bottle feeding,' Mr Grennan said. 'But one of the misconceptions is that I'm out there in the freezing cold and dark with a big coat on me looking through a telescope at the night sky - sometimes, or most of the time, when I'm looking for these things I'm inside watching the television.' Mr Grennan's telescope is in a shed in his back garden that has a retractable roof . The stargazer has written a specific computer program with complex algorithms and criteria to allow his telescopes to target certain galaxies at certain times even if he is not in the shed . Software developer Mr Grennan has discovered three supernovae or exploding stars over four years from a shed at the bottom of his garden . The Hubble Space Telescope was carried into orbit by a Space Shuttle in 1990 . Hubble's four main instruments observe in the near ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared . Its orbit outside the distortion of Earth's atmosphere allows it to take extremely high-resolution images with almost no background light . Hubble's Deep Field has recorded some of the most detailed visible-light images ever, allowing a deep view into space and time . The telescope is one of NASA's Great Observatories, along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope . Hubble is the only telescope designed to be serviced in space by astronauts . Its scientific successor, the James Webb Space Telescope is currently scheduled to be launched by Nasa in 2018. When Mr Grennan made his second supernova discovery in 2012 he was contacted by Lomonosov Moscow State University which admitted its scientists had failed to pick up on the discovery weeks earlier. Planets and asteroids can be named but the fleeting supernovae are registered according to the year of discovery. They are the spectacular explosion of a star or sun like ours, caused by a violent collapse or the weight of material being pulled into its orbit. Mr Grennan made the first discovery of a supernova from Irish soil in 2010 and two years before that he discovered an asteroid - a minor planet three metres wide - and named it after his late mother, Catherine Griffin, who encouraged his interest in the stars when he was a boy. David Moore, head of Astronomy Ireland, said: 'He's certainly Ireland's most prolific supernova hunter.' Despite his success in his spare time Mr Grennan has quite a way to go to top the success rate of Tom Boles, a retired telescope maker originally from Glasgow who has more than 100 discoveries to his name and an asteroid named in his honour.","Dave Grennan, 42, from Dublin, spotted the star on Good Friday .

"By . Jaya Narain . With rising state pension age, we have all been warned we will be working longer in the future. But that doesn’t bother Albert Billington, who is happy being one of Britain’s oldest workers. At 90 years old he shows he is still a very handy man to have around - working at DIY store B&Q. Happy Birthday: Albert was treated to a special one of a kind silver apron to celebrate his achievement . Still going: Albert Billington refuses to slow down after 70 years of work . Mr Billington only joined the company at the age of 67 after a 53 year career in the print industry. Beginning at the age of 14 in the general print trade he worked at a number of national newspapers on Fleet Street. But on his retirement he found he missed the discipline and camaraderie of work he started work in 1990 at B&Q Sutton in south London where he served as the car park attendant. He worked in the car park until the age of 80 when he left to work as a store greeter in Bristol. Vintage: Albert arrived in style as he was driven to work in a silver Bentley . Hard worker: The 90-year-old shows no sign of slowing down and still loves to work . Popular: Albert said he missed the interaction with people on a daily basis when he retired from his job in the print industry . For the past 10 years his pleasant demeanour, friendly welcome and beaming smile have greeted customers on arrival at the store. But he was given royal treatment by his bosses this week when he celebrated his 90th birthday. A vintage Bentley - one of Mr Billington’s favourite cars - was sent to his house in ensure he would arrive in work in style and his birthday was celebrated with a specially-baked birthday cake. And as a valued member of the workforce he was also presented with a one-of-a-kind silver B&Q apron to mark the landmark birthday by store manager, Alan Lamberm. Retirement: B&Q say Albert is the perfect example of how age is just a number . Customers and colleagues were on hand to help cheer on the plucky nonagenarian. Mr Lamberm, manager at Longwell Green, Bristol, said: ‘We’re excited to be able to share in the excitement of Albert’s big day. ‘To still be working at aged 90 is no mean feat and we’re proud to have him in our team here. Still smiling: Albert relishes the daily grind of a manual job . ‘Albert is a much loved colleague who does a great job greeting our customers and passing on his home improvement knowledge. He really is a shining example of the fact that age is really just a number and that you’re only as old as you feel.’ As a naturally gregarious person, Mr Billington says enjoys meeting different people and now has several close friends he had met through his work. He also enjoys DIY and has completed numerous home improvement projects through the years which puts him in good stead when he comes to advise customers in-store. B&Q -the UK’s largest home improvement retailer- says it is proud of the diversity within its workforce with over a quarter (28 per cent) of store employees aged over 50. B&Q scrapped its own retirement age in the mid 1990s after a project saw an entire store in Macclesfield, Cheshire being staffed by employees over 50 - the initiative produced 18 per cent higher profits and six times less staff turnoverr. B&Q was also founding member of the Employers Forum on Age, a network created by employers to remove barriers to an age-balanced workforce. Sydney Prior was B&Q’s previous oldest worker. He died last year at the age of 97. Britain’s oldest shopkeeper - 103-year-old Jack Yaffe - died last year after running a store in Manchester since 1934.","Albert Billington, 90, works at his local B&Q in Bristol .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . An Iranian actress has infuriated ultra conservatives in her home country after kissing the president of the Cannes film festival's on the cheek. Leila Hatami's peck has been seen by fanatics as an affront to the 'chastity' of the Islamic republic's women. A photograph carried by Iranian media shows Hatami pecking 83-year-old Gilles Jacob at the opening of this year's festival. Now Hizbullah Students, a group of university students with links to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard have filed a complaint with Iran’s judiciary for Hatami's prosecution. Scroll down for video . Iranian actress Leila Hatami pecks Gilles Jacob, the president of the Cannes Film festival, on the cheek in a move that has sparked outrage among ultra conservatives in her home country . ‘We, the undersigned, who are a group of student Muslim brothers and sisters, ask the cultural and media branch of the judiciary to prosecute Leyla Hatami for her sinful act of kissing a strange man in public, which according to article 638 of Islamic Criminal Justice carries a prison sentence,’ the petition read. ‘Furthermore, the action of this film star has hurt the religious sentiments of the proud and martyrs breeding nation of Iran and as such we also demand the punishment of flogging for her as stipulated in the law.’ Held in high regard: Hatami (second left) is on the jury at this year's Cannes festival in southern France, along with (l-r) Carole Bouquet, Jeon Do-yeon, Cannes Film festival general delegate Thierry Fremaux, Jury President Jane Campion and jury member director Sofia Coppola . Deputy Culture Minister Hossein Noushabadi weighed in, quoted by the website of state broadcaster IRIB, he said: 'Those . who attend intentional events should take heed of the credibility and . chastity of Iranians, so that a bad image of Iranian women will not be . demonstrated to the world,' . 'Iranian woman is the symbol of chastity and innocence,' he said. He said Hatami's 'inappropriate presence' at the festival was 'not in line with our religious beliefs'. Born into a family with a background in cinema, Hatami gained worldwide fame for her role in Asghar Farhadi's A Separation, which won the 2012 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. She is on the jury this year at the annual Cannes festival in southern France but lives in Iran. Hatami is one of five women members on the Palme d’Or prize jury, which includes actress Carole Bouquet and directors Sofia Coppola and jury president Jane Campion. According to Iran's interpretation of Islamic (sharia) law, in place since the 1979 revolution, a woman is not allowed to have physical contact with a man outside her family.","Leila Hatami's peck has been seen by fanatics as an affront to the 'chastity' of the Islamic republic's women .

"By . Associated Press . A former U.S. Marine convicted of criminal charges in Iran after being accused of working for the CIA will appeal for a new trial after already seeing his sentence reduced once, an Iranian news agency reported on Sunday. Amir Hekmati, a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen born in Arizona, was arrested in August 2011, then tried, convicted and sentenced to death for spying. However, Iran's Supreme Court annulled the death sentence after Hekmati appealed, ordering a retrial in 2012. The country's Revolutionary Court then overturned his conviction for espionage, instead charging him with 'cooperating with hostile governments' and sentenced him to 10 years in prison. The former U.S. Marine, Amir Hekmati, convicted of criminal charges in Iran after being accused of working for the CIA will appeal for a new trial after already seeing his sentence reduced once . The Obama administration in November asked for Iran to free Hekmati and two other Americans believed held there, as relations recently have thawed between Washington and moderate President Hassan Rouhani (pictured) Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabaei, Hekmati's lawyer, said he would appeal the 10-year prison sentence as well, according to a report by the semi-official ISNA news agency. ISNA quoted the lawyer saying the rehearing request comes over a possible mistake by the judge in the case and the 'inconsistency' between Hekmati's alleged crime and its punishment. Iranian law allows for hearings after an appeals court decision for those reasons. Tabatabaei said Hekmati has handed his request for rehearing to prison authorities. Iranian prosecutors said Hekmati received special training and served at U.S. military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan before heading to Iran as a spy. The Obama administration in November asked for Iran to free Hekmati and two other Americans believed held there, as relations recently have thawed between Washington and moderate President Hassan Rouhani. The Obama administration in November asked for Iran to free Hekmati and two other Americans believed held there . The call comes as world powers continue negotiations with Iran over its contested nuclear program. His family, now in Michigan, says Hekmati is innocent and only went to Iran to visit his grandparents. The U.S. government repeatedly has denied the 31 year old is a spy. Previously, Tabatabaei said he sought Hekmati's conditional freedom from Evin prison, north of the capital, Tehran. Hekmati has been behind bars since his arrest. Conditional freedom could allow Hekmati to leave the country, depending on what a court decides. That could allow Hekmati to visit his father Ali Hekmati, a professor at Mott Community College in Flint, Michigan, who family members say has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and recently suffered a stroke. Tabatabaei said a doctor treating Hekmati's father at a U.S. hospital has sent him a letter asking the ex-Marine's leave on bail to meet his ailing father.","Amir Hekmati, a dual U.S.-Iranian .

"By . Associated Press . An American soldier blinded in Afghanistan and the widow of another soldier killed there have filed a $44.7 million wrongful death and injury lawsuit against a Canadian man who was held at Guantanamo Bay and pleaded guilty to committing war crimes when he was 15. Layne Morris of Utah and Tabitha Speer of North Carolina filed their lawsuit Friday in federal court in Utah against Omar Khadr, who signed a plea deal in 2010 that he committed five war crimes, including the killing of U.S. soldier Christopher Speer, in 2002. As part of the deal, Khadr admitted to throwing the grenade that killed Speer and injured other soldiers, including Morris, who lost sight in one eye from the shrapnel, the lawsuit states. The Toronto-born Khadr is serving the remainder of his eight-year sentence in Canada. Lawsuit: In this file photo, Tabitha Speer, widow of Sgt. 1st Class Chris Speer, is seen next to former sergeant Layne Morris . Morris and Tabitha Speer are concerned that Khadr might get his hands on money from a $20 million wrongful imprisonment lawsuit he filed against the Canadian government, said Don Winder, a Salt Lake City-based attorney who is representing them. 'We don't know if he'll ever have any money, but we need to make sure that we're doing the right thing and the principles are right,' Winder said, noting that Morris is dealing with his injuries and Tabitha Speer is raising two children without any income from her husband. The lawsuit seeks damages for Speer's wrongful death and distress to Speer for suffering from his injuries before dying, in addition to damages for Morris and his wife. It wasn't immediately clear if any similar lawsuits have been filed against other detainees at Guantanamo, the U.S. naval base in Cuba. Prisoner: Omar Khadr, seen in this file artists' rendering, pleaded guilty to committing five war crimes when he was 15 . Widow: In this file photo, Tabitha Speer, widow of Sgt. 1st Class Chris Speer,  speaks to reporters on the sentencing of Khadr at his military commission at Guantanamo Bay . It's unclear if Khadr has an attorney in the Utah lawsuit. Dennis Edney, a Canadian attorney who has represented Khadr, did not return messages from The Associated Press. He has said the facts of the plea deal are false and Khadr signed it so he could return to Canada. Khadr's military trial drew criticism because he was captured at age 15 and seriously wounded during a four-hour battle at an Afghanistan al-Qaida compound in 2002. Khadr's lawyers and human rights groups contended he was groomed to be 'child soldier' and should have been sent home for rehabilitation. They said Speer died in a battlefield killing that did not amount to a war crime. Khadr was prohibited under the deal from calling witnesses at his sentencing hearing who would support defense claims that he was a 'child soldier,' forced into fighting the U.S. by a radical father who was an associate of Osama bin Laden. 'The fact that the trial of a child soldier, Omar Khadr, has ended with a guilty plea in exchange for his eventual release to Canada does not change the fact that fundamental principles of law and due process were long since abandoned in Omar's case,' Edney said in 2010. Military prosecutors in the case portrayed Khadr as a dangerous terrorist. Khadr spent 10 years at Guantanamo, and was transferred to Canada in 2012 to serve the remainder of his sentence.","Layne Morris of Utah and Tabitha Speer of North Carolina filed their lawsuit in federal court in Utah against Omar Khadr .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Hillary Clinton has been spotted at the annual Memorial Day parade in Chappaqua, New York which she has attended almost every year since buying a house in the area after her husband left the White House. She was the only member of her family to attend today's event but what she lacked in numbers she made up for in spirit as she was wearing a patriotic outfit. The former Secretary of State and expected Democratic presidential nominee wore a casual navy suit, a straw hat and a flowing stars-and-stripes scarf. Patriotic pantsuit: Hillary Clinton accessorized her navy outfit with a flag scarf . Political posturing: Westchester county executive-turned-gubernatorial candidate Rob Astorino shared this photo with the former Secretary of State at the Memorial Day parade in Chappaqua today . Buzzfeed reporter Ruby Cramer was at the parade and posted a message on Twitter saying that Mrs Clinton did not appear to have any staffers accompanying her throughout the parade. She added that it only looked as if Clinton had one visible security guard. She walked much of the way alongside Rob Astorino, the county executive for Westchester which encompasses Chappaqua. Spending time with a local politician at a local event would not raise any concerns normally but the pairing is particularly unusual at the moment since he is running for governor against Andrew Cuomo, who previously served as former President Clinton's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Mrs Clinton has spoken in the past about how she enjoys the Memorial Day parade in Chappaqua and tells her aides to try to make sure that she is able to attend in spite of her busy schedule. Waving to the crowd: The Clintons are regulars at town events since buying a home in the New York City suburb in 2000 after leaving the White House . Obliging: Mrs Clinton arrived 20 minutes early and happily spoke to residents, posing for dozens of photos . 'I put this on my calendar every year, and I basically tell my staff I really, really, really want to do this,' Mrs Clinton told The New York Times in 2012- months before stepping down as Secretary of State. 'Unless there’s some crisis of significant proportions, I’ll be here, and I’ve had a few crises where I’ve had to take phone calls as I’ve marched. Next week I’m going to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Turkey, but I said, ""That is going to happen after Memorial Day, no matter what.""' The Clintons bought a $1.7million home . in the New York City suburb in 2000 and, at the time, it was widely . considered a strategic move since it allowed her to run for Senate in . New York. Since then, the . political power couple have routinely impressed their neighbors by . ingratiating themselves with the community by supporting local . businesses and attending events like the Memorial Day parade. Crowds . of locals and visitors alike took pictures of Mrs Clinton at today's . parade and she reportedly got to the parade early so that she could . spend 20 minutes talking to residents before the parade officially . started. Back in the day: The Clintons have made a point of attending the parade every year since they moved into the area in 2000 (pictured at the 2007 parade when she was a Senator of New York) Representing: She said that her husband (pictured at the 2007 parade) was not able to make it this year because he is in Sweden .","The former Secretary of State has made a point to attend the Chappaqua parade every year .

"By . Belinda Robinson . Caught: Victoria Earle, from South Shields, South Tyneside has received a suspended prison sentence at Newcastle Crown Court despite stealing over £30,000 from vulnerable customers . A banker who stole more than £30,000 from sick and elderly customers has walked free after a judge decided her dishonesty was a ‘cry for help’. Victoria Earle targeted the accounts of four vulnerable customers at her branch of the Lloyds TSB bank. Three of the personal banker’s victims had Alzheimer’s disease and one was blind and deaf. One of the customers was nearly 70 and the rest were in their 80s. But the court heard she was getting over the loss of a grandparent and was finding her work stressful. The judge, Mr Recorder Edward Bindloss, said a suspended jail sentence and the loss of her good name was adequate punishment. Newcastle Crown Court heard the 40-year-old mother of two, who had worked at the bank for more than 20 years, would make withdrawals from the accounts using her ID card and process the transaction as if the customer was actually there at the bank in South Shields. She would then simply pocket the cash. Earle was caught after one of the customers noticed a withdrawal she could not remember making and a data trawl at the bank revealed what had been going on. Prosecutor Mark Guiliani said: ‘The bank checked CCTV and when the transactions were being made the customer was not there.’Earle confessed to detectives what she had done and admitted she had targeted those who were forgetful and who were unlikely to realise that they were being duped. Mr Guiliani said: ‘She targeted vulnerable and elderly victims and exploited her position to draw money from their accounts. Lloyds TSB: The court heard the mum-of-two had worked at this Lloyds bank in South Shields for over 20 years and would make withrawals from the accounts using her ID card and process the transaction as if the customer was actually there . ‘She calls it a failure in the system she was exploiting. The actual situation is she was exploiting her position as an employee and breaching the bank’s trust in her. It was not a weakness in the system.’ Earle, from South Shields, South Tyneside, admitted six charges of fraud over two years between 2011 and 2013. Judge Bindloss told her: ‘I am satisfied you targeted those customers because of their vulnerability, knowing the money taken would not be noticed by them.’ But he said he took into account the fact Earle was suffering from depression after the loss of a grandparent, pressure at work starting to mount, communication problems with her husband and financial worries. He added: ‘Notwithstanding the targeting, there was here, in some bizarre way, a cry for help.’ The judge suspended Earle’s12-month jail term for 12 months, with supervision, and said the loss of the ‘high achiever’s’ good name would be a significant punishment. He added: ‘You knew the day would come when you would be caught.’ Depression: A judge said her dishonesty was a 'cry for help' as she was suffering from depression after the loss of a grandparent and stress at work . Brian Hegarty, defending, said Earle . struggled when she was promoted to personal banker, which required her . to be a ‘pushy sales person’ with targets to meet. Mr Hegarty said that his client has signed a declaration which will allow the £31,997 she stole to be taken out of her pension and paid back to the bank. Lloyds TSB has already reimbursed the customers. Under the 2006 Fraud Act, the maximum sentence for cases of fraud heard at a crown court is ten years in jail. Fraudsters who target vulnerable victims such as the elderly will face tougher penalties in future under sentencing guidelines unveiled last week.","Victoria Earle worked at the Lloyds TSB bank .

"By . Emily Crane . Paedophile priest: Frank Klep, 70, has been jailed for 10 years for sexually abusing 15 schoolboys at Salesian College Rupertswood in Sunbury more than 30 years ago . A judge was forced to halt his sentencing of a Victorian paedophile priest after he became visibly upset while speaking about his 'evil’ crimes. Judge Frank Gucciardo choked back tears and had to briefly leave the courtroom after describing the impact of Frank Klep's abuse of 15 schoolchildren during his sentencing on Monday morning. He remained outside the courtroom for several minutes before he came back in, apologised and continued to hand down the sentence. Klep, 70, was jailed for 10 and a half years after preying on sick and vulnerable boys while running the infirmary at Salesian College Rupertswood in Sunbury more than 30 years ago. 'The young men you have abused were broken by your conduct,’ Judge Gucciardo said. 'There is no doubt your conduct plummets (sic) the depths of evil hypocrisy.’ Klep, who was a priest, teacher and for a time principal at the school, abused the boys between 1974 and 1983. He often targeted boys who had been sent to the school's infirmary and once pinned a boy down on a bed and raped him. Klep even told one of his victims that what he was doing was 'natural’ after the boy questioned him. Judge Gucciardo said Klep knew his position of authority as a priest and teacher would prevent his victims from coming forward and the boys who did try to tell their parents were not believed. He said Klep used vulnerable young men for his 'vile sexual gratification’. Choking back tears: Judge Frank Gucciardo had to briefly leave the courtroom after describing the impact of Frank Klep's abuse during his sentencing on Monday morning . Klep pleaded guilty to 15 counts of indecent assault, buggery, attempted buggery and rape. Broken Rites researcher Dr Bernard Barrett said Klep was inflicted upon his victims as the Catholic Church looked the other way. 'It's not just what he did with his left hand or his right hand, it's what he was allowed to do,’ he told reporters outside court. 'Their parents trusted the church in those days. Those days are gone.’ At a plea hearing last month, defence barrister Julie Sutherland said Klep had a spectacular fall from grace and had become a pariah who was known as 'the paedophile priest’ wherever he went. Klep has twice before been convicted sexually abusing children. He was previously convicted of child sex crimes in 1994 and placed on an intensive corrections order. Klep was defrocked in 2006.

"By . Louise Cheer . Almost every single 2013 Holden Commodore and Caprice is being recalled after a potential fault with the front seatbelts was found. The car manufacturer is recalling a total of 42,000 vehicles from the VF Commodore and WN Caprice range - models that went on sale in May last year. A public recall was issued by Holden on Monday afternoon - a week after a confidential message was sent to the company's network of 230 dealers. The 2013 Commodore, released just last year in May, is being recalled because of a fault in the front seatbelts . The message ordered them to stop selling any more new Commodores and Caprices, and told them not to transfer the cars to other showrooms. It has been discovered the seatbelt pre-tensioner - which automatically tightens the seatbelt in the event of a crash - can make contact with the seatbelt buckle unit under the seat. This could potentially cause an electrical short and disable the pre-tensioner in the crash. Pre-tensioners are meant to catch the seatbelt's slack just milliseconds before airbags are deployed. The manufacturer said no one had reported the fault. It has been advised that owners of the 2013 Commodore and Caprice model should contact their nearest Holden dealer. Dealers will then inspect the car and correct the fault.","A front seatbelt fault has been discovered in the manufacturer's 2013 fleet .

"By . Emily Crane . The man accused of murdering a Sydney newsagent owner and his family tried to take over the business just months after their deaths, a court has been told. Newsagent Norman Lin, his wife Lily, their two sons and Lily's sister were found dead in their North Epping home in July 2009. Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie, who is also Mr Lin's brother-in-law, has pleaded not guilty to the murder charges. Yang Fei Lin, the father of a murdered Sydney newsagent owner, told a court on Monday that his son-in-law tried to take over the business just months after he allegedly murdered five members of the Lin family . Mr Lin's father, Yang Fei Lin, told the court on Monday that as discussions about the family's assets were carried out three months after the deaths, Xie asked to take over the small business worth about $500,000. 'We were already running the newsagency, we didn't need his interference,' he told the court through a Mandarin interpreter. 'His purpose was to take over the newsagency.' Xie was told he would have to take care of business loans and interest payments but Mr Lin said Xie was adamant he didn't have to pay off debt and disputed the estimated $2 million value. Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie asked to take over his dead brother-in-law's North Epping newsagent, which was worth about $500,000 . The family's home in North Epping was worth about $1.2 million, they owned a $300,000 unit at Merrylands and the newsagency was valued at $500,000, according to Mr Lin. He also tried to stop Xie from attending meetings about the potential sale of the newsagency.

"By . Louise Cheer . A man fractured both his ankles and potentially his pelvis after he used an illegal rock swing in the Blue Mountains National Park, west of Sydney. While tied to a rope attached to a tree, the 32-year-old leapt off Hanging Rock Point at Blackheath about 1.45pm on Sunday, and landed about eight metres onto a ledge. New South Wales Police Inspector Peter Scheinflug said the extremely dangerous activity involved a person jumping from an escarpment and free falling until stopped by the rope, and then pendulum swinging. Scroll down for video . The footage shows a thrill-seeker at Hanging Rock Point in the Blue Mountains stepping off a cliff, in the same location where an illegal rock swing was used by a man who was seriously injured on Sunday . The rope which is usually tied to a tree or a jutting rock point, stops the person from dropping metres into the valley . In this case, the man continued to swing after he landed and came to stop about 50 metres from the top of Hanging Rock, where people pulled him to the top. An ambulance special casualty access team arrived and the injured man was carried a short distance before he was winched by a rescue helicopter to Westmead Hospital. But videos posted on YouTube show the illegal rock swing at the Blue Mountains is a popular attraction for thrill-seekers. The footage shows people stepping off a ledge at Hanging Rock Point, with just a rope suspending them over a metres-high fail. After they are stopped by the rope, the person swings back and forth like a pendulum suspended over the valley . NSW Police have warned illegal rock swinging is highly dangerous, not only risking the thrill-seeker's life, but the lives of those rescuing them if it goes awry . The adventurers are seen swinging back and forth between rock faces after the rope stops them from falling. The rope is usually tied to a nearby tree or around a rock point. 'It is shocking people take such risks and need to be warned about the obvious dangers,' Inspector Scheinflug told AAP. 'They are not only risking their own life but the lives of those whose job it is to rescue them.' A ranger from NSW National Parks and Wildlife is investigating the alleged breach of safety laws.

"By . Sally Lee . A convicted murderer who butchered and severed the penis of his housemate tried to avenge the death of his prison mate by attempting to kill a prison guard. Michael Stephen Owen-Darcy violently attacked four Wacol prison staff inside the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre in January last year, the Brisbane Supreme Court was told on Monday. The 35-year-old killer pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of a prison guard, causing grievous bodily harm to another by biting part off his ear and seriously assaulting a third prison staffer. Convicted murderer Michael Stephen Owen-Darcy violently attacked prison staff at the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre's Maximum Security Unit (pictured) in January last year . The court was told that Owen-Darcy lashed out at prison staff for letting accused double murderer Scott O'Connor, 31, who killed himself in the jail's Maximum Security Unit on January 22, reported The Courier Mail. The crown prosecutor said Owen-Darcy tried to murder a guard by using a homemade 'shiv' - a razor blade taped between two paddle pop sticks - on January 25. He repeatedly tried to slice his victim's throat, face and arm. The crown said during the attack Owen-Darcy was heard yelling: 'I'm going to murder you, you b*****d.' 'This is for my mate (O’Connor) in the MSU. I want to see how long it will take to get (help) to one of your own staff.' The killer is currently serving life imprisonment after being sentenced in 2010 for slaying his friend and housemate David John Easton, 37, at Brisbane's southwest suburb of Inala in July 2007. The 35-year-old stabbed his landlord and friend David John Easton 41 times at their home on Andromeda Street, Inala . Owen-Darcy stabbed Easton 41 times with four different knives during the savage attack and then sliced off the dead man's genitals. His testicles were found in the kitchen sink while his penis was wrapped in cling film and placed inside a salt container, Brisbane Times reported.

The court was told that two days after his initial prison attack, he used his 'teeth as weapons' to bite off a large piece of a guard's ear. 'Without a weapon (Owen-Darcy) used his teeth to bite off part of the ear of a prison officer (and assault another),' the crown said. The court was told that as Owen-Darcy was already serving a term of life imprisonment for Easton's murder he had been entitled to apply for parole in mid-2022. Justice David Boddice sentenced Owen-Darcy to 17 years for the jailhouse attacks and declared him to be a dangerous violent offender. Owen-Darcy will have to serve at least 80 per cent of his latest sentence behind bars which means his eligibility parole date has been extended until late 2027. 'This was a cold, calculated and callous act on your behalf,' Justice Boddice said in sentencing Owen-Darcy. He told the prosecutor that it would now be up to parole authorities to decide whether Owen-Darcy should ever be granted release due to his long history of seriously violent crimes.","Michael Stephen Owen-Darcy violently attacked prison staff at the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre's Maximum Security Unit in January last year .

"By . Lillian Radulova . Adelaide carnivores beware: a new study shows most supermarket deli meats are carrying bacteria in levels that exceed food safety guidelines. The study found 134 out of 174 samples of various ready-to-eat deli meats bought at randomly selected supermarkets across South Australia, had bacterial levels that failed to meet guidelines. Professor Michael Reichel was part of the study by Adelaide University which found a poor level of hygienic food handling of deli meats by Adelaide retailers . The results of the research, carried out last year by students at Adelaide University, will be presented this week at a Perth conference. 'Although no recognised food poisoning pathogens such as Escherichia coli or Salmonella species were found on these meats, the high bacterial count suggests that hygiene has been compromised,' said the university's Professor Michael Reichel. 'Such out-of-control processes are also susceptible to contamination with serious food poisoning organisms.' Sliced salami, fritz and roast pork showed the highest proportions of unsatisfactory bacterial counts. Ham and chicken meats had lower levels of bacteria, but two-thirds of those samples still failed to meet satisfactory standards. He said 15.5 per cent of samples showed the presence of coliform bacteria, indicating possible faecal contamination and poor hygiene such as people not washing their hands after going to the toilet.

Professor Reichel confirmed that the samples were taken from a wide variety of locations including Coles, Woolworths, IGA, Foodland and some randomly selected local butchers. As well as revealing food safety issues, the results related to food quality. 'People have a right to expect that the product they buy on the weekend should last through the following week, not go slimy in a couple of days,' he said. He called on supermarkets and retailers to review their processes and staff compliance, as well as carry out more microbiological testing.

"By . Associated Press . Bunny Yeager, a model turned pin-up photographer who helped jump-start the career of then-unknown Bettie Page, died Sunday, her agent said. She was 85 years old. Yeager died at a North Miami hospice where she had been for about a week, her agent, Ed Christin said. Yeager's legacy is her cultural impact, from pin-up photography and fashion, helping to popularize the bikini, and influencing other artists such as Cindy Sherman, who read Yeager's guides on photographing nudes and making self-portraits, Christin said. In this 1960 file photo originally released by Bunny Yeager, Yeager poses for a self portrait in Naples, Florida. She died this weekend at a Delray Beach hospice .

'Anyone in Miami in the 1950s who wanted a bikini would come to her, and she'd make one,' he said. Yeager became famous for making everyday women, from stay-at-home mothers to airline attendants, feel comfortable enough to bare it all. Her photos of Page in a leopard-print bathing suit standing next to a real cheetah are still well-known today. 'They all wanted to model for me because they knew that I wouldn't take advantage of them,' Yeager told The Associated Press during a 2013 interview.

Linnea Eleanor Yeager was born in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, on March 13, 1929, and in the 1940s became one of the most photographed models in Miami during her early career. She later turned the camera on herself, posing in bathing suits she handmade for her 5-foot-9 frame. Her self-portraits were turned into a book, 'How I Photograph Myself,' in 1964. She began taking photos of Page in 1954 as she began her career behind the camera.

She published about a dozen books and her work has been displayed in art galleries across the world. Besides the iconic Page photo, Yeager also shot stills of the Swedish actress Ursula Andress, who starred in the 1962 James Bond film 'Dr. No' in a white bikini, a knife sheathed at her side. Yeager said she had few requests when several magazines began to struggle or went out of business over the last decade, but her career returned to the spotlight in 2010 when the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh held an exhibition of her work. There was also an exhibition in Miami in 2013.

"By . Kate Lyons . Bill Heffernan, who represents NSW in the federal senate, pulled out what appeared to be a pipe bomb at Parliament House to highlight loopholes in security screening measures, while addressing prominent Australian policemen. The Liberal party senator produced the 'bomb' to showcase gaps in the new security arrangements at Canberra's Parliament House, which were introduced last week and allow MPs, senators, their families and staff, and public servants to enter the building without being screened by X-ray machines or metal detectors. Under the new arrangements, which are designed to speed up entry and save money, the public, journalists based in the building, contractors and diplomats would still be screened. Scroll down for video . Liberal Senator Bill Heffernan smuggled a pipe bomb into Parliament during a Senate Committee meeting to highlight flaws in the security arrangements at Parliament House in Canberra . Senator Heffernan was addressing Australian Police Commissioner Tony Negus and other Australian Federal Police officials during a senate Budget estimates hearing about the agency. 'This building is no longer secure,' he said. 'To demonstrate that, I brought in what could be… I brought this through security, a pipe bomb.' 'When I was a kid we used to blow stumps out on the farm, 50 years ago. We'd get some nitropril, a quart of distillate, a plug of jelly and a detonator, light the bloody thing and [it would] go to buggery. It could blow a tree the size of this building out of the ground.' Under the new security arrangements MPs, senators and public servants will not be forced to pass through a metal detector or X-ray machine upon arrival at Parliament House . 'This building is no longer secure': Senator Heffernan has been a supporter of increased security measures at Parliament House for many years . He produced the bomb, which was later confirmed to be a replica, while addressing Australian Police Commissioner Tony Negus and other Australian Federal Police officials . 'At the present time there is nothing to stop anyone from bringing those ingredients in here over a period of time through security, would you agree?' Senator Heffernan asked. Mr Negus responded: 'Senator under the current arrangements, that is a risk, yes.' Senator Heffernan also added that there was the risk that someone working in a role that did not require them to be searched, might be forced or tricked into carrying dangerous materials into Parliament House by someone else. Commissioner Negus later confirmed to the committee that the senator had showed him the 'bomb' before the committee hearing began and that Mr Negus was convinced it was just a piece of pipe. Senator Heffernan brought a knife in NSW Parliament in 2009 to highlight security weaknesses. The knife was confiscated from him. He also sparked controversy when he questioned Julia Gillard's ability to be Prime Minister on the grounds she was 'deliberately barren' and in 2002 the senator accused then High Court judge Michael Kirby of using Commonwealth cars to solicit under-age male prostitutes. The controversial senator has been accused of making homophobic comments to staffers and to former High Court judge Michael Kirby . Bill Heffernan claimed that his pipe bomb could blow up a tree as tall as Parliament House . Parliament resumes sitting today after a break of more than a week. The government is anticipating considerable backlash in parliament as their controversial budget is debated. Senator Heffernan's stunt sparked bemused reactions on social media. 'Bill Heffernan again breaks Tony Abbott's promise that this would be a government of ""No Surprises"",' quipped Victorian Labor MP Tim Watts.

"By . Louise Cheer . and Lillian Radulova . West Coast Eagles midfielder Elliot Yeo is facing a lifetime of trips to the dentist and an estimated $70,000 dental bill after his two front teeth where knocked out of his mouth in a sickening collision on Saturday. The 20-year-old's front teeth were snapped off in the brutal blow during Saturday's clash against Collingwood at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Footage from the moment Yeo's mouth came into contact with Collingwood ruckman Jarrod Witts' shoulder, shows two white objects flying into the air as the midfielder is knocked to the ground. The loss of the teeth happened when West Coast midfield Elliot Yeo had a run in with Collingwood ruckman Jarrod Witts . The midfielder continued playing for the rest of the game and tweeted after it: 'All I want for Christmas is two front teeth...' Instantly feeling the damage done to his mouth after the impact, Yeo was seen flashing his new look to the referee, revealing his splintered teeth with the roots still intact. The midfielder and ruckman collided after Yeo failed to take an easy mark, the ball slipping through his grasp, right before the half-time siren. It was reported by afl.com.au that trainers were unable to find the teeth. Yeo's teammate Xavier Ellis, told The Age that he was confident Yeo has been wearing his mouthguard right up until the moment of impact. 'I think he had it in for the majority of the night and took it out for 30 seconds to have a breather. I don't think he'll do that again,' Ellis said. 'I think he just took it out for literally 30 seconds and the ball came, so it's a hefty price to pay.' The former Brisbane Lions players falls to the ground after the brutal hit, but the tough player stood up quickly . But despite the obvious pain, he played on for the remainder of the game . Despite the blow, Yeo shook off the injury and soldiered on, earning the respect of his coach. 'It was a big knock … he should have taken the mark,' Eagles coach Adam Simpson told afl.com.au. 'He kept on going, I don’t know if he was in a hell of a lot of pain or not, but he didn’t seem to take a backward step after it.' Yeo appears to inspecting the damage done to his mouth, touching the roots that were left intact . Unfazed by the incident, Yeo was in good humour after the game and fired off this cheeky tweet . Yeo played the second half and ended the match with 19 disposals and a goal in the Eagles' eventual eight-point loss to the Magpies. After the game, Yeo tweeted a cheeky reference to the knock: 'All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth...'. His teeth are expected to be capped this week as long as there has been no splintering and no nerve damage. The last time the sport saw a player lose their teeth on the field was almost five years ago when Lance Franklin, a Hawthorn forward, tucked his mouthguard into his sock. A collision with St Kilda’s defender Zac Dawson saw him lose a tooth. Despite the injury, Yeo is expected to be back on the field on Sunday for a match against North Melbourne.","The West Coast midfielder clashed with Collingwood ruckman Jarrod Witts .

"By . Sarah Michael . Iranian asylum seeker, Reza Berati, died during a riot at the Manus Island detention centre in Papua New Guinea . A  Salvation Army employee led the attack that killed Iranian asylum seeker Reza Barati during the riot on PNG's Manus Island, an independent review has been told. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison on Monday released the long-awaited review - conducted by former public servant Robert Cornall - into the February violence. The review says Mr Barati, 23, suffered a severe brain injury when he was kicked by multiple please and a rock was dropped on his head, in an attack led by a Papua New Guinean man employed by the The Salvation Army. Mr Cornall interviewed an eye-witness to the attack. 'He said the attack was led by an identified PNG national employed by The Salvation Army and he named several other witnesses who he says can corroborate his statement.' The Salvation Army issued a statement on Monday which acknowledged the findings of the Cornall investigation, in which they cooperated, and offered condolences to the family of Mr Berati. The statement said: 'At the time of the alleged incident all Salvation Army personnel (both Australian and PNG) had been formally evacuated from the Centre in accordance with security protocols. 'The Salvation Army condemns any such behaviour and to the extent that any criminal actions as alleged are ultimately found by the PNG authorities to have occurred, they were not done with the knowledge or authority of The Salvation Army.' The Salvation Army's contract to provide services at the Manus Island and Nauru centres ended at the end of February. Scroll down for video . The Government review into the Manus Island riots said frustration and anxiety over a lack of information about resettlement policies was a key contributor to the tensions . The organistion was responsible for providing educational and recreational opportunities - including English classes, access to computer rooms and gym activities - and emotional and psychological support to asylum seekers. The witness, who watched the attack through the open door of his room, said Mr Barati was in the internet room in the Mike compound when he heard gunshots fired and started coming up the staircase towards the witness's room. The witness, described as a friend of Mr Barati who had come from Indonesia on the same boat as him, saw Mr Berati being followed by the Salvation Army employee who was known to him. 'When [Mr Barati] was trying to come upstairs, he hit him twice with a very long stick, and at the door of the room, when he was trying to come upstairs he further fell down,' the witness said. 'When he fall, all of the guards who were passing, they kick him in his head, and the last one, one of the PNG locals [redacted], the man [redacted], he put a very big stone at his head.' The medical officer who treated Mr Barati at a triage centre on Manus Island said when he was brought in he was alive but medical staff knew he would not survive. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison on Monday released the long-awaited review into the February violence on Manus Island . 'Mr Barati's head was shattered by a crack on the left side of his skull… He also has facial abrasions and knocks indicating he has received a more general beating,' the medical officer’s record of interview said. The treating doctor’s record of interview stated Mr Barati was bleeding externally from the back of the skull, and his fixed, dilated pupils suggested a 'catastrophic cranial injury'. Mr Morrison said the government had accepted all 13 of the review's recommendations, including better lighting, fencing and CCTV surveillance. The review found there was no particular factor that caused the violence. 'It is not possible to isolate one factor which, if handled differently, may have resulted in less injuries and damage or to apportion blame for causing the incidents directly to one or more of the parties involved,' it says. But it says frustration and anxiety over a lack of information about resettlement policies was a key contributor to the tensions. At least 69 people were treated for injuries as a result of the violence, including one man who lost his right eye, another asylum seeker who was shot in the buttocks, and another man who was slashed across the throat . At least 69 people were treated for injuries as a result of the violence, including one man who lost his right eye, another asylum seeker who was shot in the buttocks, and another man who was slashed across the throat. Mr Morrison described the events as 'terrible and tragic'. He said the review's recommendations had either already been implemented, or were in the process of being implemented. This comes amid a report that almost half of asylum seekers in mandatory detention are suffering from mental health disorders, according to assessments by a government-contracted health provider. The results show that the percentage of the asylum seeker population suffering from 'extremely severe' depression, anxiety and stress gets larger the longer they are held in detention. A Salvation Army employee led the attack that killed Iranian asylum seeker Reza Barati during the riot on PNG's Manus Island, the independent review was told . The percentage of asylum seekers reported to be suffering from 'extremely severe' mental disorders after being in detention for longer than 18 months is almost triple the percentage reported for asylum seekers who have been in detention less than three months. The findings were presented at the annual congress of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists earlier this month by Dr Peter Young, director of mental health at International Health and Medical Services, the firm contracted by the government to provide medical services in detention centres. A report by IHMS also showed a jump in the number of asylum seekers detained on Christmas Island reported to be suffering due to trauma and torture, ‘indicating a high level of need for torture and trauma counselling services on the island’, The Age reported.","Immigration Minister Scott Morrison released review in Manus riots .

"By . Ben Spencer . One in three councils in England and Wales charge residents to collect garden waste . More than three million families are paying a ‘garden tax’ to have their lawn clippings taken away by the council, Daily Mail research reveals. One in three councils in England and Wales charge residents to collect garden waste. The levy, which can cost up to £120 a year, is not imposed by authorities in Scotland or Northern Ireland, which have retained free collections. It is feared that many householders simply send their hedge trimmings and other garden waste to landfill – or dump it in the street – to avoid the charge. Local authorities blame Whitehall budget cuts for the garden waste fees, which come on top of hefty council tax bills. But Brandon Lewis, the Tory minister for local government, last night accused councils of using residents as ‘cash cows’. Daily Mail analysis of official data collected by Wrap, the Government’s waste quango, reveals that 3.12million homes had to pay for garden waste to be collected by their councils in 2012/13. The English and Welsh councils which still offer a free service – two thirds of the total – collected green waste from 13million households with gardens, according to the latest figures. Mr Lewis said: ‘We believe that councils must not use residents as cash cows. People pay a £120-a-month council tax bill for services, including bins – they deserve a decent service in return.’ Several more councils have  abandoned free collections in recent months. Birmingham City Council, Britain’s largest local authority, introduced a £35 charge for garden waste collection in February. Just 37,000 of the city’s 400,000 households have signed up for the service, and residents report that many are dumping waste in the street instead. Liberal Democrat John Hemming, the MP for Birmingham Yardley, is considering legal action against the authority. He accused the Labour-run council of ‘failing in its duty’ to the city. ‘It’s a complete mess,’ he said. ‘They should reverse the decision on the green waste tax.’ Local authorities blame Whitehall budget cuts for the garden waste fees, which come on top of hefty council tax bills. File picture . The council has had to resort to warning of a £2,500 fine for anyone who dumps garden waste on the street. Labour councillor James McKay, who is in charge of waste services at the council, told a local newspaper: ‘It was always going to be difficult to take away a service which had been free. ‘We can’t continue to provide the same level of service when our controllable budget has been cut by two-thirds.’ Liberal Democrat-run South Gloucestershire Council, which introduced a £36 yearly charge in March, estimates the scheme will generate £1.2million a year. However Ian Adams, a Conservative on the council, predicts it will damage the environment as more residents simply put garden waste in their bin for ordinary rubbish rather than it being recycled. Charges also vary wildly across the country. Hart Council in Hampshire charges up to £120 a year for a fortnightly service, while Harlow Council in Essex charges £85. A spokesman for the Local Government Association said councils had increased their recycling from 13 per cent in 2001 to 43 per cent today, adding: ‘It is for individual councils to decide if the costs of additional green waste collection should be met by all council taxpayers or those that use the additional service.’","Local authorities blame budget cuts form Whitehall for fees .

"By . Daniel Mills . Shoppers are bypassing the display windows and bee lining for the beach this may, as unseasonably mild weather dampens retailer's winter spirits. Major retail chains, including Myer, are meeting this week to discuss when to start moving an over supply of winter stock at reduced prices, as consumers opt to ditch the winter woolies in favour of shorts and shirts. In the past three years, the end of financial year discounts has started on June 1. But with weather records continuing to be beaten across the eastern seaboard, sales signs are already popping up in shop windows. Early sales: The pressure is on for major retailers which are being forced to bring forward the traditional winter sale periods . And it appears there is little let up in sight, with forecasters tipping at least another five days of above average temperatures for Sydney and Brisbane. Sydney extended its record warm spell to a ninth day on Sunday, and for most of the coming week will have maximums of at least 23 degrees. A top of 26 is predicted for Tuesday, which is well above the long-term average for May of 19.4 degrees. In Brisbane, it's a similar scenario, as the continuation of warm days this week has Weather Zone meteorologist Drew Casper-Richardson predicting the hottest seven days for this time of year in Brisbane’s history. Today will see a a top of 29 degrees Celsius for the Queensland capital, with maximums of 27 through to Thursday. Retailers may also be forced to put an oversupply of winter stock on the clearance racks at budget prices . And while the spell of hot days continue, retail stores with a heavy reliance on clearing lots of winter stock are going into crisis mode. A spokesperson for Myer told Fairfax Media that it will meet this week to discuss when to bring its sales period forward. 'There is nothing definite, but we will be discussing this at the directors' meeting,' the spokesperson said. More...

Australia continues to bask in late-autumn heatwave... with Sydney temperatures smashing 100-year record . The chief executive of the Australian Retailers Association, Russell Zimmerman, said the warm weather was wreaking havoc across the retail sector. 'This is having a huge impact on retail turnover, margins and stock holdings,' Mr Zimmerman said. He said it's not just the thick winter woolies which aren't selling, but everything from boots, to kitchenware's such as soup makers and crockpots, manchester and bedding. 'Even if we get a sharp cold spell, most people will now wait for the sales to buy new items that they may only use for a couple of months.' Crisis talks: Myer confirmed it is meeting this week to discuss when it will put its sales signs up in store, earlier than the traditional June 1 start of the sale period . Coupled with the pressure of internet shopping and new international fashion and homewares brands, It is not a good sign. But a saving grace has been the booming residential sector, which has helped furniture and home-related sales. And some food retailers, such as cafes and supermarkets, have also benefited by thee spell of warm weather as food courts expand their operations outdoors. Mr Richardson said as long as the high-pressure keeps hovering above Sydney, the blue skies will remain. “As long as we have a high-pressure system sitting over us, there's not much chance of rain,” Mr Casper-Richardson said.","Retailers struggling to sell oversupply of winter stock .

"By . Ryan Lipman . Jesse Kelly  has been arrested for allegedly breaching his parole for the crime which sent him to jail and sparked the violent Macquarie Fields riots in Sydney in 2005. Kelly was arrested in Eschol Park by Macquarie Fields Police about 3pm Saturday. While police officers completed a revocation of parole warrant, they say a small amount of the drug ice was found on Kelly in a search. He was charged with drug possession and will face court next month, reported The Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . Troubled: One of the people involved in a three-car crash outside Leumeah High School this morning is Jesse Kelly, the driver of the stolen car that crashed sparking some of Sydney's worst riots at Macquarie Field in 2005 . On Thursday, Kelly was one of three people in a Ford Falcon involved in a three-vehicle smash in Sydney's southwest outside Leumeah High School, . Kelly's brother and cousin suffered facial, leg and hip injuries and two women were also hospitalised. 'I'm just a piece of s***, ay. Go away,' Jesse Kelly told waiting media outside Liverpool Hospital. Kelly, whose driving license is suspended, denied he was behind the wheel of the Ford Falcon that crashed into two vehicles outside the school at around 8.30 am and refutes witness claims. Police say he was one of three men in the car. Mr Kelly suffered cuts to his legs in the crash and his brother and cousin, who were also in the Ford, remained in hospital on Thursday night in a stable condition. Crumpled: Two of the cars outside Leumeah High School, south-west Sydney, on Thursday . Dramatic: Two women and three men were injured in the smash which happened around 8.30am just as children were being dropped at school . Investigating: Police are looking into the incident as two men remain in hospital on Thursday night . Asked as he left hospital what happened, Mr Kelly bluntly said 'there was a car accident '. A witness to Thursday's crash outside Leumeah High School told The Daily Telegraph she was dropping her son at school when she was injured in the three-car smash. Joanne Madden said: 'We were just driving off and a car was coming down and he came onto the wrong side of the road.' Mr Kelly, his brother and cousin are now under police guard at hospital. It is understood police are also searching for another youth who fled Liverpool Hospital. Unrest: Police made numerous arrests in Macquarie Fields in Sydney's south-west in 2005 during ongoing unrest sparked by the death of two local teenagers in a stolen car driven by Mr Kelly . Frightening: They were some of the worst riots in Sydney's history . Kelly was only released from jail on bail last year, after pleading guilty to dangerous driving causing the deaths of his two passengers. In February 2005, he  was driving a stolen Holden Commodore when it smashed into a tree in Macquarie Fields just seconds into a high-speed police pursuit. The crash killed Matthew Robertson, 19, and a 17-year-old Dylan Raywood. After the crash, Kelly fled the scene and went on to hide in bush for 12 nights, while four nights of riots between police and residents exploded. Kelly was given a maximum seven year and nine month sentence with a non-parole period of five and a half years.

"By . Darren Boyle . Pope Francis today called for an 'urgent' end to the civil war in Syria on the opening of a three-day trip to Middle East. The pontiff praised King Abdullah of Jordan for encouraging a 'climate of serene co-existence' between Christians and Muslims in his country. Pope Francis said: 'Religious freedom is in fact a fundamental human right and I cannot fail to express my hope that it will be upheld throughout the Middle East and the entire world.' Pope Francis has begun a three-day visit to the Middle East by visiting the supposed site of Christ's baptism on the river Jordan and dipping his hand in the water .

He arrived at Amman's Queen Alia International Airport where he was met by an honour guard as well as Prince Ghazi bin Mohammed, the king's chief advisor for religious affairs, before traveling to the Royal palace. At the palace, Francis met with Abdullah, Queen Rania and their children. In his palace speech, Francis said Jordan's 'generous welcome' to Syrian refugees warranted international appreciation and support. It is estimated that there are 600,000 refugees from the Syrian conflict living in camps within Jordan.

Francis will spend Monday in Jerusalem, visiting the grand mufti of Jerusalem and Israel's chief rabbis, albeit separately. He'll also pray at the Western Wall and visit the Holocaust memorial at Yad Vashem. The Vatican spokesman had suggested that with such a grueling schedule, Francis might not have the strength for an on-board press conference on the return flight from Israel on Monday night. Francis, 77, who has only one full lung and has battled a cold and fatigue that forced him to cancel some recent appointments, set the record straight at the start of the trip.

"By . Louise Cheer . The study comes 30 years after President Ronald Reagan kick started the process, making the US the world leader in missile defences . Australia has no need for a ballistic missile defence system because countries posing a threat are too far away, a new study says. But modest investments should be made in defence system research to prepare for the future safety of the nation. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute study also said current technology was not up to scratch and Australia should keep an eye on it as it progresses. These measures would place the nation in a good position to adopt a ready system if it is needed later on. The study comes 30 years after President Ronald Reagan kick started the process, making the US the world leader in missile defences. Mr Reagan unveiled his 'star wars' vision in 1983 with the expectation that incoming ballistic missiles could be shot down with combined space and land-based missile and laser systems. But a system capable of that is yet to come to fruition. According to ASPI, the superpower's current land and sea-based systems would be quite effective against a limited attack by basic, short-range missiles like those possessed by North Korea and Iran.

"By . Martin Jay In Beirut And Jack Doyle . Firebrand: Omar Bakri has been arrested in Lebanon after authorities in the country cracked down on radical Salafist preachers . The radical Islamist cleric Omar Bakri who is said to have once described the July 7 bombers as the Fantastic Four was arrested in Lebanon yesterday. Bakri, 54, was the spiritual leader of banned extremist group Al-Muhajiroun and lived in London where he was known as the Tottenham Ayatollah. He went on the run in Lebanon last month following a raid on his house in a crackdown on radical clerics following a spate of car bombs, shootings and assassinations. He was arrested by security forces in the eastern town of Aley. Bakri was sentenced to life in Lebanon in 2010 following a terrorism conviction, but was released on bail after witnesses recanted their testimony. The 54-year-old sparked controversy in UK over his inflammatory language including calling for young British Muslims to take up arms and join Al Qaeda. After travelling to the Lebanon nine years ago he was refused re-entry to the UK. Since then he has faced repeated investigation by the Security Services in that country. He went on the run last months following a raid on his house in the wake of a crackdown on radical clerics in the country. Local media reports on Saturday suggested intelligence officers raided a house on a retreat in the early hours on Mount Lebanon. In March he told The Daily Mail when speaking of the troubles in Tripoli ‘only jihad salafi can save it and save Lebanon’. He added: ‘This country needs to be made an Islamic state, obviously ... but I know the security services are getting ready to nab me soon’. Tottenham ayatollah: Omar Bakri on stage with Abu Hamza at the Rally for Islam in Trafalgar Square in 2002 . The radical Islamic cleric was placed under house arrest after he was released from jail shortly after arriving in war-torn Lebanon in 2005. It was reported that Bakri referred to the four suicide bombers who killed 56 people on July 7 as ‘the fantastic four’. He said the British people were to blame for the terror attacks on the capital because they ‘did not make enough effort to stop its own government committing its own atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan’. He also sparked outrage when he said on TV that he would not inform police if he knew Muslims were planning a bomb attack on a train in the UK and supported Muslims who attacked British troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. More recently there were reports he issued a ‘fatwa’ against Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai who he said ‘should be sentenced to death’. Bakri denies being an Al Qaeda leader, while openly praising the terrorist organisation including its leadership. He came to attention in 2004 when he led a demonstration outside the US Embassy in London in which protesters chanted the name of Osama bin Laden and torched an American flag.","Omar Bakri, 'the Tottenham Ayatollah', was leader of Al-Muhajiroun .

"By . Michael Zennie . The Santa Barbara massacre that left seven people dead, including gunman Elliot Rodger, on Friday night has already begun to bring calls for tougher gun control laws. Rodger had three semi-automatic handguns that he had purchased legally from a Southern California gun shop - along with more than 400 rounds of ammunition. This, despite the family disclosure that he was diagnosed at a young age as being 'a highly functional Asperger Syndrome child' - a form of autism. The family said he had been receiving treatment for disorder. However, the diagnosis did note make him ineligible to buy firearms in the state of California. Elliott Rodger bought three handguns from a local gun store. Police say he used them to kill three people and then take his own life . Three weapons: The Glock 34 (lower left) is a competition-grade variation of the popular pistol - made for accuracy and handling. Rodger also had two Sig Sauer P226 pistols (right) Rodger wrote in his 10,000 word online . manifesto about buying his first weapon, a Glock 34 semiautomatic . pistol, at Goleta Valley Gun & Supply in Goleta, California. 'I had already done some research on handguns, and I decided to purchase the Glock 34 semiautomatic pistol, an efficient and highly accurate weapon. I signed all of the papers and was told that my pickup day was in mid-December,' he wrote. 'After I picked up the handgun, I brought it back to my room and felt a new sense of power. I was now armed. Who’s the alpha male now, b*****s?' He later purchased two more handguns - Sig Sauer P226. All three weapons are semi-automatic pistols chambered in 9mm - similar to what many law enforcement agencies use. In his online screed, Rodger said that he wanted three pistols so that he could have two at the ready at all times. 'I needed two working handguns at the same time, as that was how I planned to commit suicide; with two simultaneous shots to the head,' he wrote. This is the gun shop where Rodger said he bought at least his first handgun - Goleta Valley Gun and Supply store in Goleta, California . Police found three pistols in Rodger's car after he crashed it and shot himself dead Friday night . California has some of the toughest handgun restrictions in the state. Gun owners must pass a state and federal background check. They then must wait ten days after the purchase of a handgun before they can pick it up at the store. Additionally, California residents cannot buy more than one handgun each month. Though all three of the pistols were designed to hold at least 15 rounds, California law limits magazine capacity to ten rounds. Police say Rodger gunned down three people  on his rampage - University of California, Santa Barbara sorority sisters Katie Cooper and Veronika Weiss and UCSB sophomore Chris Martinez. He also opened fire on sheriff's deputies who arrived on scene, before fleeing, crashing his BMW and taking his own life. On Saturday, grief-stricken Richard Martinez, the father Chris Martinez blasted the NRA at a press conference. 'Chris was a really great kid. Ask anyone who knew him. His death has left our family lost and broken,' he said. 'Why did Chris die? Chris died because of craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA. 'They talk about gun rights. What about Chris’s right to live? When will this insanity stop? When will enough people say, ""Stop this madness, we don’t have to live like this."" Too many have died.

Russian president Vladimir Putin has called comments made by Prince Charles comparing him to Adolf Hitler 'unacceptable' and 'wrong', adding remarks of this kind are 'not what monarchs do'. Mr Putin's response came just days after the Prince was reported to have made the remark in a private conversation with a Jewish refugee during an official visit to Canada. His comments have met with a furious response from the Kremlin, with Putin's spokesman accusing the Prince of 'historical ignorance', while state-funded television channel Russia Today broadcast a programme highlighting the Royal Family's links to the Nazis.

He added that remarks of this kind are 'not what monarchs do' Audience: Russian President Vladimir Putin made his comments during a visit to Saint Petersburg today (pictured). He held interviews with top news agencies and discussed his thoughts on Prince Charles' remarks . During an interview with the world's leading news agencies in St Petersburg today, Mr Putin said Prince Charles' remarks remind him of the proverb: 'You are angry. That means you are wrong'. In a direct personal message to the . Prince, he added: 'Give my words to Prince Charles. He has been to our . country more than once. If he made such a comparison it is unacceptable . and I am sure he understands that as a man of manners.' Prince Charles's remark has sparked particular anger in Russia because of the country's pride in its contribution to the defeat of Nazism in the Second World War. An estimated 26 million Soviet citizens died in the conflict, including almost eight million members of the military. Mr Putin did not refer directly to . Russia's wartime sacrifices in his response to the Prince's remark, but . he pointedly mentioned them earlier when discussing the upcoming 70th . anniversary commemorations of the D-Day landings in Normandy. Both . men are due to attend the event. The moment in question: Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall meet Jewish refugees in Canada. The photograph was taken seconds after the prince compared Putin to Hitler .

The guns . may have long grown silent but there is still likely to be an . embarrassing tension in the air on June 6, even if the Prince and the . president do not shake hands. They . will be joined by a host of world leaders from the US president Barrack . Obama and the Queen, to France's president Francois Hollande, who will . be hosting the event attended by 2,000 Allied veterans. 'During the Second World War, we were allies and we were fighting together against Nazism,' said Mr Putin. 'As . you know very well, the peoples of the Soviet Union and the people of . Russia sacrificed a lot to win the war and achieve our joint victory . over Nazism.' 'That . is why it is quite natural that we are going to have a meeting in . Normandy and we are going to pay tribute to our coalition partners, to . the British, the Americans and the French.' Mr Putin's 90-minute televised interview . at his official residence of Constantine Palace at Strelna came at the . end of an international economic forum in nearby St Petersburg. At the event he struck a conciliatory note on Ukraine, indicating that he will . recognise the victor of tomorrow's presidential election in the former . Soviet state. Royal Nazis: A feature on Russia Today's In the Now programme, saw senior political correspondent Anissa Naouai telling viewers: 'If anyone knows real Nazis, it's the Royal Family' The presenter showed a picture of the Duke of Windsor - Charles's great uncle - visiting Hitler shortly after abdicating as Edward VIII. She added that his wife Wallace Simpson also 'hung out' with the Nazi leader . Harry the Nazi: She goes on to note that the Duke of Edinburgh's sister, Sophie, was married to an SS officer before segueing to a photo of Prince Harry wearing a Nazi Uniform to a fancy-dress party in 2005 . Today, he repeated that promise, telling . senior executives and correspondents from 12 news agencies: 'We will . treat any choice of the Ukrainian people with due respect.' He added: 'We are going to treat the choice of the Ukrainian people with due respect and we are going to work with the authorities that are going to be shaped based on the elections.' However, he made clear that he continues to regard former president Viktor Yanukovych, ousted in February after months of protests, as Ukraine's legitimate leader. Ukraine's constitution allowed presidents to be removed on grounds of incapacity, impeachment or resignation, he said, adding: 'Look at the Ukrainian constitution. Read the words. We are adults. We can read.' Mr Putin said that he would have preferred to see a referendum staged on a new constitution before any presidential election, as envisaged in an agreement between the regime and opposition shortly before Yanukovych's removal in what he termed an 'anti-constitutional coup d'etat'. Asked whether the Ukraine crisis was pushing the world towards a new Cold War, Mr Putin said: 'I wouldn't like to think that it is the beginning of a new Cold War, because no-one is interested in that and I think it will not happen.'","Russian president discussed thoughts on Prince of Wales' comments .

"By . Wills Robinson . A 'rock star' economist who wrote a bestselling book about the growing wealth gap between the rich and poor appears to have got his sums wrong. Thomas Piketty, 42, included a number of errors and spreadsheets in Capital in the Twenty-First Century, which has dominated book charts around the world in recent weeks. The 577-page thesis, which claims wealth inequality has been soaring since the First World War, uses a huge amount of statistics as evidence. But an investigation found there were errors in transcripts from original sources and incorrect forumulaes. Thomas Piketty, 42, is believed to have included mistakes in his book Capital in the Twenty-First Century, which claims wealth inequality is soaring. He says he made it clear that some of the data needed to be changed . For example, his figures claim wealth became more concentrated in Britain during the 1980s, but his sources do not back it up. He is also alleged to have cherry-picked some of the information. When The Financial Times stripped down the data, they found that there was no evidence of rising wealth inequality from 1970. In the book, he urges that income taxes should be increased to 80pc on earnings in excess of either £300,000 or £500,000 a year. There are claims the French economist 'cherry-picked' information to include in the 577-page thesis, which suggests the gap between rich and poor has been increasing since the First World War . He also suggests a global . wealth tax, imposed at the rate of 1 per cent a year on fortunes of . £600,000 to £3 million, up to as much as 10 per cent for those earning . more than a billion. Defending . the claims, Professor Piketty said he has made it clear that some of . the statistics need changing and has published his work online so it can . be altered in the future. He said: 'As I make clear in the book, in the online appendix, and in . the many technical papers I have published on this topic, one needs to . make a number of adjustments to the raw data sources so as to make them . more homogenous over time and across countries. 'I have tried in the context of this book to make the most justified choices and arbitrages about data sources and adjustments. The top line shows how much of British wealth is concentrated in the top 10 per cent of income earners and the bottom refers to the top 1 per cent. The yellow line represents Piketty's estimates whereas the blue lines represent the aggregate of figures collated from a number of financial bodies. The discrepancy between Piketty's sums increases after 1970 with large gaps in the data in 2010 . 'I have no doubt that my historical data series can be improved and will be improved in the future.' 'But . I would be very surprised if any of the substantive conclusion about . the long run evolution of wealth distributions was much affected by . these improvements. He also argues that the rise in top wealth shares in the US in recent decades has been even larger than what he shows in his book. The work has received plaudits from economists and politicians around the world. Ed Miliband told the Evening Standard: . 'I’m in the early stages of the book. In a way, he is symptomatic of . what people are actually feeling'. Nobel Prize-winner Paul Krugman from Princeton University said: 'It will be the most important economics book of the year.'","Thomas Piketty included errors in Capital in the Twenty-First Century .

"By . Sarah Dean . Australian aircraft have been pumping out toxic fumes, exposing passengers and crew to chemicals more than 1000 times over the past five years, it has been claimed. And customers aboard flights are not always about the dangers, a report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau has revealed. Some airline staff are seeking legal action over fears that the fumes and exposure to radiation could be leading to an increased risk of brain and breast cancer. Scroll down for video . Toxic: The BAe146 aircraft has been named as one of the worst offenders for fume emission . Brett Vollus, who worked for Qantas for 27, is preparing a case after being diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour . The news comes as a flight attendant, who is trying to prove a link between pesticides sprayed on international flights and his Parkinson’s disease, has been diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour. Brett Vollus, who worked for Qantas for 27 years, said: 'I was only diagnosed with the brain tumour when I tripped because of the Parkinson's and went to hospital for a scan.' He is preparing a case against the government in a bid to know more. 'There has to be a link between these brain tumours and cancers among flight crew and the toxic environment that we are working in,' he said. Meanwhile, a former pilot, who collapsed from aerotoxic syndrome after repeated exposure to fumes from heated jet oil in the cockpit of the BAe146 aircraft, has claimed: 'Being exposed to chemicals every day made me sick'. Susan Michaelis is now head of research at the Global Cabin Air Quality Executive and says her research has found clusters of cancer and neurological problems among flight crew. 'There is a pattern of chronic ill-health... and it needs to be looked at further,' Ms Michaelis told News.com. The report named the BAe146 aircraft as one of the worst offenders for fume emission, although no individual airlines have been singled out. Independent analysis of the ATSB figures shows the Boeing 767 also had 123 fumes exposures from less than 20 planes between 2008 and 2013. Qantas is phasing out their Boeing 767 but has denied the plane was any worse than other aircraft types. Worrying: Independent analysis of the ATSB figures shows the aged Boeing 767 also had 123 fumes exposures . 'Fume incidences across the Qantas fleet are extremely rare, particularly those from engine oil,' Qantas medical services director Dr Ian Hosegood said. In December 2013, five flight attendants who have developed Parkinson's - including Mr Vollus - contacted law firm Turner Freeman to ask about taking legal action against the Commonwealth government. They want to know more about the links between Parkinson's and the spraying of insecticides on flights in line with World Health Organisation guidelines to prevent the spread of potentially deadly mosquito-borne viruses. Turner Freeman lawyer Tanya Segelov told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'When Brett was diagnosed, his neurologist asked him what he did, and he said he worked for Qantas, and his response was: ""Oh, another one,""' 'We have now had four more long-haul flight attendants come forward this morning, and I think we are going to see more and more people coming out of the woodwork.'","Report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau says toxic fumes have been pumped out more than 1000 times over the past five years .

"By . James Salmon . Follow @@JamesSalmon79 . Deputy governor Charlie Bean suggested that interest rates will rise from a record low of 0.5 per cent to 'settle' at 3 per cent between 2017 and 2019 . Millions of homeowners are facing a jump in mortgage repayments after a senior Bank of England official warned interest rates could rise to 3 per cent in three years. Deputy governor Charlie Bean suggested that interest rates will rise from a record low of 0.5 per cent and will ‘settle’ at 3 per cent between 2017 and 2019. Last night experts said this could add more than £200 to the monthly cost of a typical mortgage of £150,000. News of the likely rise will add to fears that a generation of homeowners could soon struggle to afford their monthly repayments. Only last week a report warned 2.3million homeowners in the UK would become ‘prisoners’ to their home loans if there was even a modest rise in interest rates. The Bank of England has assured households that a hike in interest rates is not imminent, saying that any increase will be gradual. And Governor Mark Carney has indicated that the rate will not start rising before next Spring. But speaking to BBC Radio 4’s The World This Weekend, Mr Bean pressed the case for taking these small steps sooner rather than later. He said: ‘The bank rate averaged about 5 per cent in the decade or so before the crisis. ‘It’s reasonable to think that given the headwinds that are still out there as well as some of the global forces that the level we go to three or five years out might be a couple of percentage points below that.’ Mr Bean went on to say that there was a case for moving in ‘baby steps’ to avoid making mistakes as ‘we won’t be certain about the impact of tightening the bank rate’. But he added: ‘If you want to pursue that strategy you need to start taking baby steps a bit earlier, otherwise you end up being behind the curve.’ Interest rates have been frozen at a record low of 0.5 per cent since March 2009, providing a boost to homeowners but misery for savers. Rapid improvements in the economy, including a sharp drop in unemployment, have increased pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates. This image shows how the base rate has changed over the last decade, shown in blue, and what the Bank of England estimates it might . steadily rise to until 2019, shown in red . Last month Mr Carney said they may . remain low ‘for some time’ but added that the economy has ‘edged closer’ to the point where interest rates would need to rise. However . the Resolution Foundation think-tank has warned that millions could . become ‘prisoners’ to their home loans if rates rise. In . a report, they said that 2.3million people would be expected to fall . behind with payments – with one in ten householders at risk of . struggling financially or even losing their homes as a result. The research also predicted that an increasing number of people will be unable to switch to better deals as rates rise. And . fears are mounting over what impact even a small increase will have on . borrowers who have got used to record low mortgage costs. David . Hollingworth, from mortgage broker London and Country, said: ‘Over the . last five years some households will have become complacent about how . low interest rates have been. ‘It’s . now all about preparing for when they do climb, either by fixing your . mortgage or by choosing to pay down your debt as quickly as possible.’","Deputy governor Charlie Bean warned rates will rise from low of 0.5 per cent .

"By . Daniel Mills . A $54 million waterfront mansion located in an exclusive Sydney suburb is set to become the most expensive Australian property to be knocked down. The Altona residence in Point Piper, located just metres back from Sydney Harbour, will smash the current record for a demolition property by more than $20 million if a decision to move the wrecking ball in gets approved next month. The fate of the 1960s estate is in the hands of Sydney's Woollahra Council, which will need to assess whether the benefits of building a more contemporary estate on the site outweighs the current property's heritage listed significance. Exclusive: The Altona mansion in Point Piper sold for $54 in 2008 and will become Sydney's most expensive property to be demolished if it gets approved in June . A heritage assessment report compiled for the council recommends against the knockdown of the Victorian Italianate residence, but the report only lists the original features of the two-storey residence as being a parapet, two chimneys and a tower. The same council blocked a previous application for the current record knockdown, the Craig-y-mor mansion in the same suburb in 2008, only for it to get approved by appeal in the Land and Environment Court. It was sold to Chinese investors for $32 million in 2008. More... Hit for $6.5million! Cricketer David Warner treats his baby mumma Candice Falzon to the mansion made famous by Geordie Shore . Kipling's exceedingly nice hideaway: Tucked away on the South Coast... the house where literary giant crafted his greatest works . Australia's highest real estate: Inside the $18 million penthouse that towers 280 metres above Melbourne and can be controlled with an iPhone . Should the Altona suffer the same fate as is its non-waterfront neighbour, it will surpass the Craig-y-mor knockdown price by $22 million. Demolished in 2008: former residents of the The Villa Porto Rosa, built in 1928 and knocked down after it was sold for $28 million. The Craig-y-more home was demolished in favour of a $5 million rebuild, and like many before it, investors are opting to go with more contemporary housing rather than preserve the history of older buildings on exclusive parcels of land. Many of the historic homes which have suffered a similar fate lie in Sydney's east, area's where their reputations have been built on  high-end housing. Point Piper itself is is home to the millionaires row and is no stranger to passing a record or two when it comes to demolitions. The waterfront estate Paradis sur Mer was a high-profile knock down and rebuild in 1990, and not only because it was sold for a then record high $19.2 million in the late 1980s by Sir Frank and Lady Susan Renouf. A report into the heritage significance of Alton says the two-storey home only has a parapet, two chimneys and a tower as part of the original build. Built in 1937 for the Radford family, it was knocked down to make way for two houses at the end of the peninsula, one called Paradis sur Mer II, which is owned by the wife of businessman David Gonski, and the second home called Radford. A third smaller residence has been built on the former slipway on the site, which is for sale for about $15 million. Ken Jacobs, of Christie's International, who sold the property in 2008, said investors are looking to snap up the best positions and put properties on them which will get the best return. 'The best positions are always the first to go and so it is in Sydney where you have these extraordinary vantage points, and buyers who want the position but not necessarily the house that stands on it,' he told Fairfax Media. 'The reality is that some of these properties, although not all, are highly under-capitalised.' In Watsons Bay, a 1928-built Spanish villa, Villa Porto Rosa, sold in 2008 for $28.1 million and within months of the sale, the home had been leveled and work was under way to rebuild the beachfront mansion. In Elizabeth Bay, the waterfront mansion Cardigan was sold for $8.5 million in 1996 to the East Asia Property Group, after it had already been approved for demolition to make way for seven apartments.Some of Sydney's grand old mansions do often survive the wrecking ball to be converted into apartments. Two examples include homes Babworth House in Darling Point, and Kilmory, in Point Piper.","The Altona in Point Piper would surpass the record by more than $20 million .

"By . Mark Prigg . Netflix has agreed to pay Verizon to ensure its video streams receive priority over the ISPs network. It comes amid growing concern over ISPs plans to throttle high-bandwidth services such as Netflix - and claims from Netflix boss Reed Hastings that payments are an 'arbitrary tax'. The deal comes just weeks after a similar agreement with Comcast was revealed. Companies such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and Microsoft have been looking to compete with traditional TV programming to increase revenue.  Netflix recently agreed to pay Verizon to ensure its video streams receive priority over the ISPs network . Netflix most recent speed chart, showing a big increase for Comcast since a deal was signed - and Verizon languishing in the middle of the table. According to a brief statement, from Netflix, 'We have reached an interconnect arrangement with Verizon that we hope will improve performance for our joint customers over the coming months.' The deal has already paid off for Comcast subscribers, and recent figures show Netflix's videos are streaming through Comcast's Internet service at their highest speeds in 17 months. However, the deal also intesifies debate over whether the Federal Communications Commission should draw up new rules to ensure that all online content providers are treated the same by Internet service providers. The equal-treatment doctrine, known as net neutrality, has become a thornier topic since January when a federal appeals court overturned the FCC's regulations on the issue. Hastings recently called interconnection fees an 'arbitrary tax' that the company would pay in certain cases to protect its customers' experience. 'Instead, they must provide sufficient access to their network without charge,' Hastings wrote on the Netflix blog. He said free interconnection was key to ensuring 'net neutrality,' which requires that internet providers treat data from different content companies equally. House of Cards with Kevin Spacey as US Representative Francis J. ""Frank"" Underwood: The sucess of Netflix has caused a huge increase in the amount of traffic the service generates . He accused firms of bullying. 'Some big ISPs are extracting a toll because they can - they effectively control access to millions of consumers and are willing to sacrifice the interests of their own customers to press Netflix and others to pay,' he wrote in the blog post. 'Though they have the scale and power to do this, they should realize it is in their long term interest to back strong net neutrality. Net neutrality is also drawing more attention as Comcast tries to gain approval of its proposed $45 billion purchase of Time Warner Cable Inc., another large Internet service provider. As the world's largest Internet video subscription service, Netflix has long supported net neutrality as a way to prevent online service providers from giving better treatment to websites willing to pay additional fees for the privilege. Netflix previously had been paying third-party vendors such as Cogent Communications Group Inc. and Akamai Technologies Inc. to deliver its content to Comcast. Some analysts suspect Netflix may be saving money by paying ISPs directly instead of the vendors, but the specifics remain unknown as part of a confidentiality agreement. Net prejudice? Critics say the deal struck between the two companies is unfair to other internet providers and the people who use them . Higher streaming speeds allow users to watch higher-quality video and translate to fewer interruptions in the picture. That's good news for Netflix because higher-quality video should please many of its 33 million U.S. subscribers who pay $8 per month for the company's video streaming service. Comcast and other broadband providers contend Netflix's growing popularity should require the company to shoulder some of the financial burden for delivering its video. In evening hours, Netflix's . U.S. subscribers generate nearly a third of the Internet's downloading activity, according to the research firm. By early this year, Comcast's streaming of Netflix video had slowed to the point that Hastings felt compelled to work more directly with Comcast to retain his company's subscribers. The better access that Netflix is getting from Comcast is known as ‘interconnection,’ a term referring to digital content's journey to an Internet service provider's gates. That path technically isn't covered by the current definition of Net neutrality, which refers to how service providers treat digital content once it's inside the gates. Comcast has promised to honor the previous rules governing Net neutrality through 2018. Google's YouTube video site and many other websites were paying interconnection fees to Comcast before Netflix struck its own deal with the carrier.","Firm promises to 'boost performance' for subscribers .

"By . Martin Robinson . Convicted: A jury took two hours to find Christopher Weatherfield (pictured outside court in January) guilty for his part in a hacking campaign . A leading British member of the 'Anonymous' hacking gang was today convicted for a series of devastating cyber-attacks on some of the world's biggest companies.. On one occasion 'hacktivist' Christopher Weatherhead helped target PayPal because it would not process donations for the fundraising arm of Julian Assange's WikiLeaks, costing it £3.5million. The self-confessed ‘idealist’ boasted online he would ‘rape’ and ‘kill’ the companies Anonymous attacked. Today the 22-year-old remained impassive as the unanimous guilty verdict was returned for his part in distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attacks, which made the victim's website suddenly crash. The DDoS attacks paralysed computer systems by flooding them with an intolerable number of online requests. Victims would be directed to a page displaying the message: 'You’ve . tried to bite the Anonymous hand. You angered the hive and now you are . being stung.' Weatherhead was studying at Northampton University when he joined the cyber campaign which also attacked sites including MasterCard, Visa, Ministry of Sound, the British Recorded Music Industry (BPI) and the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). Weatherhead, who used the internet name . Nerdo, also discussed the idea of attacking Lily Allen’s website in . retaliation for her public anti-piracy stance. Prosecutor Sandip Patel said: ‘Christopher Weatherhead, the defendant, is a cyber-attacker, and that he, and others like him, waged a sophisticated and orchestrated campaign of online attacks that paralysed a series of targeted computer systems belonging to companies, to which they took issue with for whatever reason, that caused unprecedented harm.' Mr Patel said ‘Operation Payback’ had originally targeted companies involved in the music industry and opponents of internet piracy, but was later ‘broadened’ to include new objectives, including PayPal. PayPal was attacked after it decided not to process payments on behalf of the Wau Holland Foundation, an organisation involved in raising funds for WikiLeaks. Between December 8 and 17, 2010, PayPal was the victim of a series of attacks 'which caused considerable damage to its reputation and loss of trade'. Weatherhead had denied a charge of conspiring to impair the operation of computers between August 1, 2010 and January 22 last year. The jury of six men and five women returned the guilty verdict after little more than two hours of deliberations. PayPal also had to pay for further software and hardware to defend against similar future attacks. That, combined with the loss of trading, cost the firm £3.5million. Costly: PayPal and other victims suffered constantly crashing websites after being bombarded with messages . The amount the hacking cost MasterCard and Visa was not given but the defendant, in an internet relay chat (IRC) channel conversation with someone called Tred, boasted: 'We have probably done some million pound of dmg [damage] to mc [MasterCard].' The BPI was attacked on 19 and 20 September 2010, costing it £3,996 for online security and hundreds of pounds in other costs. Four websites run by the Ministry of Sound were targeted in two separate attacks between 2 and 6 October 2010, which cost the company around £9,000 in additional staffing, software and loss of sales. Motive: Weatherhead was one of several people who targeted PayPal because they would not process donations to Julian Assange's WkiLeaks . The financial cost to the IFPI was more than £20,000 as its website was down for nine days when it was hacked between 27 November and 6 December 2010. Weatherhead painted himself in court as an ideological dreamer, who stumbled across the Anonymous group by chance and agreed with its stance on censorship on the internet. 'I like the freedom of information on that is on the web', he said. 'I enjoy spending a lot of time on Wikipedia reading things. 'When you can’t get information I feel abashed by that'. Three other defendants had already pleaded guilty to the charge. They are Ashley Rhodes, 27, of Camberwell, south London; Peter Gibson, 24, of Hartlepool; and Jake Birchall, 18, from Chester. No date was fixed for sentencing but pre-sentencing reports were ordered for the four. Judge Peter Testar said: 'I am not making any promises at all by allowing bail and ordering a pre-sentencing report. This is a serious offence and I hope the defendant understands that.' Russell Tyner, Crown Advocate for the . CPS Organised Crime Division, said: 'Christopher Weatherhead is a cyber . criminal who waged a sophisticated and orchestrated campaign of online . attacks on the computer systems of several major companies. 'A self-styled ""hacktivist"", . Weatherhead and his fellow conspirators targeted companies in the music . industry involved in combating internet piracy and companies that had . stopped processing online donations to WikiLeaks. Their campaign of . attacks cost these companies over £3.5 million in additional staffing, . software and loss of sales.

"By . Emma Reynolds . 'Worldly wise': Ethiopian embassy official  Amelework Wondemagegne was jailed for 33 months today . A diplomat tried to claim immunity after smuggling £160,000-worth of cannabis sprinkled with chilli powder into the UK. Amelework Wondemagegne, an Ethiopian embassy official, was stopped at Heathrow Airport with three suitcases containing 56 kilograms (123lb) of cannabis. The 36-year-old mother of two initially said a man had given her the bags before she left Addis Ababa airport in the Ethiopian capital, and that she had believed they contained meat and spices. But Isleworth Crown Court in west London found Wondemagegne, who is based in Washington DC, was not entitled to immunity and she was jailed for 33 months after admitting one count of drug smuggling today. Judge Richard McGregor-Johnson, Recorder of Kensington and Chelsea, told her: 'The fact that you smuggled these drugs in the expectation that you would not be prosecuted if you were caught because of your diplomatic status is a significant factor in this case.' Wondemagegne, who had worked in the visa section of the embassy since 2006, travelled into the UK on April 7 using an Ethiopian diplomatic passport and had a ticket to return to the US on April 17. When her suitcases were opened by UK Border Agency officers at Heathrow’s Terminal Three, they were found to be packed with slabs of cannabis, sprinkled with chilli powder. Although she claimed to be unsure what was in the cases, photographs taken on her camera showed her with the bags. Caught out: The drugs, which weighed around 56kg (123lbs), were found in tape-wrapped packages in the mother of two's three suitcases . In one photo, she was wearing a necklace that was later found to be in a suitcase with the drugs. Judge McGregor-Johnson said Wondemagegne had told 'a pack of lies' and that she was caught with a 'substantial quantity' of cannabis, in the second category of seriousness. The judge described her as being 'worldly wise', adding: 'You knew perfectly well what you were doing and you knew perfectly well that drugs smuggling is illegally and seriously regarded.' Wondemagegne’s two children, aged 10 and 17, live in Washington DC and are being cared for by Ethiopian embassy staff there. She has been their sole carer since her husband died of cancer in 2005, a fact which Judge McGregor-Johnson said made it 'more extraordinary you should have committed this offence.' 'Pack of lies': The drugs were covered in chilli powder and Wondemagegne at first claimed she thought the suitcases contained meat and spices . He told the court he was satisfied she had not been coerced into being a drugs courier and that she had played a 'significant role' in the smuggling of the cannabis. Wondemagegne, of Silver Spring in Maryland, will be deported from the UK after serving her sentence. Peter Avery from the Border Force said: 'This was a significant amount of cannabis which could have ended up on the streets of the UK. 'It was the vigilance of Border Force officers which prevented this smuggling attempt from going ahead. 'Working with our law enforcement colleagues in the UK and around the world, we are determined to do all we can to stop the international drugs trade.'","Ethiopian embassy official at first said she did not know what was in three cases but thought it was meat and spices .

"By . Lillian Radulova . With Australia's strict asylum seeker policy putting an effective stop to boat arrivals, Indonesian people smugglers have set their sights on another 'safe haven'. More than 8,000 kilometres away, beyond the treacherous waters of the Indian Ocean and the fickle Tasman Sea, lies New Zealand, a country whose shores have so far remained untouched by any refugee boat. Various separate plans to attempt the journey have so far been thwarted, with some never making it past Papua New Guinea while others collapse at the early planning stages, still in Indonesia. New Zealand is the the new ideal location for the approximate 100,000 refugees currently in limbo in Indonesia, after crackdowns in Australia render seeking asylum in the closer country impossible . But a joint investigation by Fairfax Media and New Zealand's Sunday Star-Times, has revealed that, as desperation mounts amongst the 100,000 plus asylum seekers currently in Indonesia and with more arriving every day, smugglers continue to try and win over the wallets of those who are frantic to resettle. Part of the desperation for the 100 or so refugees that arrive each day, is their instant move into limbo, due to Indonesia not being a signatory of the Refugee Convention. This means they are dubbed illegal and are unable to work or educate their children, leaving them with the option of remaining in Indonesia with a minute chance of resettlement, returning to the home they fled or risk a spell in one of Australia's detention centres. Feeding off of these anxieties, are people smugglers, who offer the faint hope of a fourth option: New Zealand. One Pakistani travel agent, who now resides in Bogor, Indonesia, has most recently been one of the culprits behind a ploy to smuggle 50 Indian, Bangladesh, Pakistani and Afghan refugees out of the town of Cisarua and onto a boat bound for West Papua and finally Kaitaia, in New Zealand's north-west, Fairfax reports. New Zealand's Indonesian Ambassador David Taylor is skeptical about the small refugee boat's ability to successfully make the 8,000km journey from Indonesia, as no refugee boat has ever reached its shores to date . For the price of $500 US up front, and about $5000 US in total, the organisation offered the asylum seekers passage on an metal-hulled, 32m-long and 7m-high boat which he termed 'safe' for the treacherous voyage. The smugglers also claim a second boat would follow close behind as back up as they travelled along the Indonesian coast, and as far as West Papua where the larger boat would be re-provisioned and the smaller support vessel would return to Java. They told the passengers that the journey would take 10-12 days, but ensured them that New Zealand would accept the refugees if the boat made it to its destination. The plan was thwarted however when the refugees were intercepted by police after a suspected tip-off. The most recent New Zealand bound boat, which planned to follow a route similar to the one pictured, was thwarted by Indonesian officials on Wednesday . New Zealand's Indonesian Ambassador, David Taylor, says the smugglers' grand promises are all dangerous lies. 'The boats these people-smugglers are using are mainly wooden, small, they're not ocean fit and they're overcrowded . . . it's a pipe dream that they're going to be able to get to New Zealand,' he said. 'Some [smugglers] say ""we'll get you to New Zealand"" not actually intending to get there because they know they can't, [they're] hoping to get to a certain point then duck into Australia, so it's part of their marketing strategy.' In a tape obtained by The Sunday Star-Times, a money changer said the following about a proposed voyage to New Zealand: 'All passengers are waiting for getting one boat through. If one boat through, proved getting to New Zealand, more will go.'","Australia's strict asylum seeker policies have deterred refugees .

"By . James  Nye . A University of Utah football star envied by Elliot Rodger for his popularity with girls has said he was deeply unsettled to find out he was included in the virgin killer's hate-filled manifesto. Running back Lucky Radley barely knew 22-year-old Rodger when they lived in the same neighborhood as children, but the mass murderer became obsessed with the gregarious and outgoing athlete's ability to attract the opposite sex, calling him 'an object of my extreme jealousy and hatred.' In his vicious 140-page manifesto that explains why he shot and stabbed six University of California, Santa Barbara, students on Friday, Rodger mentions another boy who is popular with girls before positively seething with jealousy at Radley. Scroll Down for Video . Stunned: University of Utah footballer Lucky Radley has said he is shocked to have been named in Eliot Rodger's manifesto justifying the stabbing and shootings of six people on Friday . 'Another one was Lucky Radley, the black kid I played with in father’s neighborhood,' Rodgers wrote according to the Deseret News. 'He transferred to Pinecrest during that very year, and he immediately became popular with the pretty girls of his grade. I hated him for it.' When Radley was told that he had featured in the horrific manifesto,  My Twisted World: The Story of Elliot Rodger, he struggled to even remember the killer when they attended school in Woodland Hills, California more than 10-years-ago. 'Honestly, I was just disturbed by the whole thing,' said Radley, who is back home in California with family before the Utes begin summer workouts. 'I’m kind of at a loss for words. I never thought anyone would think of me like that. 'I like, flipped out, I went crazy,' Lucky Radley said. 'Speechless.' Sick: Elliot Rodger, 22, stabbed three people in his home and shot dead three other students before he took his own life on Friday. The rampage came after he posted rants online about how women hated him . At best they played video games together and Radley appeared on CNN on Monday morning to say that he was never even close to Rodger. 'It’s crazy,' said Radley. 'I went over to his house a couple of times, played games with him,' Radley said during the television interview. 'He was … he sat at the same desk or the same table as me in my classroom. I didn’t know him. I mean, that’s about as far as it goes.' Radley described the Rodger he knew as a smart loner who never looked him in the eye. 'He would have one-word answers. I never really heard him speak,' he said. The footballer first realized that Rodger had unleashed a rampage across Isla Vista, California on Saturday, when his girlfriend handed him a phone with mass killer's confessional video. 'I was just like, ‘Wow, this guy lived literally three doors down from me,' Radley told The Salt Lake Tribune'. 'He was really quiet. He never said anything. 'Literally, I’ve done nothing wrong to him whatsoever. 'I really hung out with him in fourth grade. After that, he was kind of doing his thing. I was into sports and he was kind of into other things.' Victims: Rodger's first victims included his roommates Weihan Wang, left, and Cheng Yuan Hong, right . Gunned down: George Chen, left, was also found . stabbed to death in their home - although he did not live at the house - . while Rodgers gunned down Chris Michael-Martinez, right, when he opened . fire at a deli . Loss: Katie Cooper, left, and Veronika Weiss . were standing outside a sorority house when they were shot . Radley said that he was shocked that Rodger held a grudge against him for so long. The popular footballer said that he remembers Rodger wearing a Blink 182 hoodie and that they sat at the same table in fourth-grade. He told the Salt Lake Tribune that Rodger's step-mother was worried that he son did not socialize and asked Radley to spend time with hi,. 'I would always play outside and try to catch lizards and stuff like that, and his mom would try to engage us and say, ‘Oh, come over! We have lizards in our backyard!’ or ‘Come over, we have pizza!; said Radley. They lost touch during middle school, and Radley hadn’t seen him since. Heartbroken: His father, Richard Martinez, breaks down next to his brother as he speaks to the media outside the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Headquarters on Saturday . Sadness: Two students comfort each other as they attend a candlelight vigil for the victims on Saturday night . During his interview on CNN, Radley was read a section of Rodger's manifesto: . 'Lucky would later go to the same middle school as me, where he would become an object of extreme jealousy and hatred. Looking back, I can't believe I actually played with him as a friend in my father's neighborhood.' Responding to this, Radley said he was 'just shocked. I literally didn't believe it...I couldn't believe it. I still can't believe it.' Of course, despite his unfortunate involvement in the manifesto, Radley said that the victims and their families have his condolences. 'My heart goes out to the families of the victims,' he said. 'You see things like this in movies, but you never imagine anything like this. For me to be connected to it, I’m still mind blown from it.'","Utah footballer, Lucky Radley, 22, was in the same 4th grade class as virgin killer Elliot Rodger .

"By . Associated Press . The son of longtime Boston Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy pleaded guilty to murder and other charges for stabbing his girlfriend last year and attacking people who tried to help her, and was immediately given the mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole. Jared Remy, 35, admitted in Middlesex Superior Court that he fatally stabbed 27-year-old Jennifer Martel in August. He described himself as 'the bad apple' and called Martel 'an angel' but said that he killed her one night because she had a knife and was threatening him. Jared Remy, 35, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and other charges for stabbing his girlfriend Jennifer Martel to death in August 2013, and was immediately given the mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole . Remy asked that his family not be blamed for his actions in court today (left). The steroid abuser (right) had been arrested for past violence against his girlfriend . Remy added: 'I would like to say, blame me for this and not my family. And if you asked my family, they’d rather have me dead than her,' the Boston Globe reported. However he also added that he had warned Martel not to threaten him with taking custody of their daughter and this was the reason he had attacked her. Remy said: 'I don’t think it’s right when women use their kids against their fathers.' He also used his time in court to say that he wanted to send a message to two unidentified people to stop using the situation 'to make themselves look good'. Remy pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, assault and battery, and violating a restraining order, among other charges. His father, a former Red Sox second baseman who has been a color analyst on team broadcasts on the New England Sports Network since 1988, was not in court for the hearing. Prosecutors described how Jared Remy repeatedly stabbed Martel, first in the couple's Waltham apartment as their four-year-old daughter screamed, and then as she crawled to an outside patio. Three neighbors tried unsuccessfully to pull Remy off Martel. Assistant District Attorney Lisa McGovern said Remy stabbed Martel in the throat, legs, arms and torso, and pinched her face. Before sentencing Remy, Judge Kathe Tuttman asked him if he disputed prosecutors' account of the stabbing. 'She had a knife in her hand. She was threatening me about my daughter,' Remy told the judge in a calm voice. Tuttman quickly moved on and accepted the plea. Remy was initially arrested August 13 after he allegedly pushed Martel into a mirror. He was released on his own recognizance and stabbed Martel on August 15. He also pleaded guilty on Tuesday to assaulting a man who tried to help Martel as Remy stabbed her. A neighbor told police he tried unsuccessfully to pull Remy off Martel during the attack. Martel posted to her Facebook page the night she was killed, 'Jennifer Martel is in a complicated (Relationship),' according to court documents. Jennifer Martel,  27, (pictured with her daughter) had finally had enough and was planning to leave when Remy stabbed her to death at their Massachusetts home . Patty Martel, mother of murder victim Jennifer Martel, wipes tears during Remy's hearing on Tuesday . An independent review criticized prosecutors' handling of abuse allegations against Remy. The . case prompted questions about whether Remy's violent history had been . overlooked by the criminal justice system. It led state lawmakers to . propose an overhaul of the state's domestic violence laws, including new . bail guidelines and tougher penalties for abusers. Since . Remy has been in jail, he has been accused of attacking another inmate, . throwing hot coffee in his face, hitting him with a plastic chair and . punching him. He is a former Red Sox security staffer who was fired by . the team in 2008 during a steroid investigation. 'I would like to say, blame me for this and not my family. And if you asked my family, they’d rather have me dead than her.' Jared Remy in court today . Last week Ms Martel's parents . spoke out for the first time to reveal that she was planning to escape . her boyfriend just days before he stabbed her to death. Patty . and Brian Martel said they saw Remy becoming increasingly controlling . of their daughter - demanding she take naps, dictating what time she was . allowed to cook him dinner and calling her dozens of times throughout . the day. For . years, they say,  their daughter rebuffed their suggestions that she should . leave the relationship. She said her daughter needed her . father. And she always seemed to see the good side of the Remy. The Martels spoke to the Boston Globe . - their first time ever speaking out about their daughter who was . brutally attacked on the front lawn of her home in Waltham, . Massaschusetts, on August 15, 2013 - just three days after Remy was . arrested for battery for slamming her into a mirror in a fit . of rage. The heavily-tattooed killer appeared to blame his victim today in court (left). Jared Remy appears at Waltham District Court for his arraignment on murder charges last October . Kristina Hill, neighbor of murder victim Jennifer Martel, wipes tears during the hearing where Remy was sentenced to life without parole . On . Monday August 12, Mrs Martel said she talked to her daughter her the . phone. After six years in an abusive relationship, Jennifer had finally . had enough. 'She said, ""Mom, don’t worry; I’m planning my escape,""' Mrs Martel told the Globe. Mr and Mrs Martel said they always knew Remy was controlling. They said . they could see him wearing down their 'effervescent' daughter - but . they never knew how dangerous he could be. 'She used to always tell me, ""Jared, he’s got a big bark, but he’ll calm down,""' Mrs Martel said. Remy is the son of Jerry Remy, a popular Red Sox announcer . 'We don’t come from violence. We didn’t recognize domestic violence. We just thought he was a jerk,' Mr Martel told the Globe. In February . 2013, Mrs Martel - who lived in Virginia with her husband, her son . Brian Jr and his wife and kids - drove to Massachusetts to visit her . daughter. What she saw there upset her. Remy, . an alleged steroid abuser, called her 'trailer trash' and blew up at . her over the smell of the cigarettes she smoked on the couple's patio. One . day, he declared that it was 'nap time' for Jennifer, Mrs Martel and . little Arianna and made them lay down in a dark room for several hours. When they were allowed to come out, he wouldn't let Jennifer cook dinner until he was ready to eat. Mrs . Martel said Remy became jealous any time Jennifer left the house . without him - except for her work time and his scheduled visited to the . gym. She . said she cut the visit to her daughter two days short when Remy became . enraged with Jennifer. He called her 17 times in a row. By the time she . picked up, she broke down in tears in a KMart as Remy screamed at her. Jennifer told her mother she had to leave - that her presence was agitating her boyfriend. Mrs Martel says she begged her daughter to take Arianna and come back to Virginia with her. According to the Globe, Mrs Martel exchanged several tragic text messages with her daughter that day. 'Mom, don’t worry; I’m planning my escape.' -Jennifer Martel, three days before she was murdered by boyfriend Jared Remy . 'I . need to see [if] I can get him help first. I talk with his family to . see what we can do. he is Ariannas father and I need to do this for . her,' Jennifer wrote. Her . mother replied: 'I just want you to be happy you don’t deserve this . Arianna loves him but as she [gets] older she going to see what he . really is... Sometimes you can’t change someone like that ... He has a . bad control on you.' Jennifer . said: 'I not going to let him control me. I have help here. jareds . parents wants what is best for Arianna and they know jared is a mess.' Later, she added: 'I cant handle another blowout like the other day. i am emotional exhausted.' The . next day, her brother, Brian Martel Jr. text Jennifer and said he would . rent a UHaul and move her out of her home with Remy if she wanted. Again, Jennifer refused. Brian . and his wife got custody of Arianna after a lengthy court battle with . Remy's father, Boston sports legend Jerry Remy. She will be raised with . her cousins.

"By . Meghan Keneally . Former President George W. Bush has undergone knee replacement surgery and is said to be recovering successfully. The 67-year-old was treated at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago on Saturday and has since returned to his home state of Texas. 'It was an outpatient procedure and he was able to walk up and down a flight of stairs just a couple hours after the surgery,' the former president's spokesman Freddy Ford told Politico. Road to recovery: Former Preisdent George W. Bush has undergone a partial knee replacement and the trouble arose in spite of his active retirement lifestyle (which includes bike races, like this one on May 2) Leading the charge: Former President Bush participated in the Wounded Warrior 100k bike race near his ranch in Crawford, Texas in early May, just weeks before his surgery this weekend . 'He came back to Dallas yesterday where he is recovering quickly at home.' The surgery was technically a partial knee replacement though it has not been announced which knee was the focus of the operation. This is not the first indication that the 43rd president has had trouble with his knee. Health: Bush, 67, had a stent operation in August . He had a case of 'runner's knee' in 2003 that resulted in an incomplete meniscus tear in his right knee but that was ruled as insignificant at the time. 'As you get above the age of 40, you . see meniscus tears on M.R.I.'s in people who have no symptoms at all and . say their knees are perfect,' Dr Kevin Freedman, the director of sports . medicine at Loyola University's Medical Center in Chicago told The New York Times when the tear was noted. Though . Bush has kept a relatively low political profile since leaving office . in 2008, he has continued to stay physically active. Earlier . this month, he reprised his role as the leader of the annual Wounded . Warrior 100k bike race near his ranch in Crawford, Texas. That was his first significant public race since having a stent put in his heart last August to clear a blocked artery. Ahead of the Wounded Warrior ride, which is made up largely of injured veterans, he said that he exerted 'executive privilege' by selecting the route to avoid some of the really tough trails'. 'This is not a race. This is a festival... so please don't pass me,' he joked, according to The Dallas Morning News.","Bush, 67, had a partial knee replacement on Saturday in Chicago .

"By . James  Nye . A legendary hacker who faced up to 26-years in prison avoided a prison sentence on Tuesday after he was hailed for his 'truly extraordinary' work over three years as an informant - during which time he essentially became an undercover FBI agent. Authorities at the US District Court for the Southern District of New York said that Hector Xavier Monsegur, a onetime member of the cyber-activist hacking group Anonymous had helped to thwart at least 300 cyber attacks and helped in the arrest of eight other hackers since 2011. Monsegur, 30, who under the name, Sabu, founded the offshoot LulzSec, shocked the hacking community by turning against them and in the courtroom on Tuesday, US District Judge Loretta Preska saluted his help as extraordinary. During his career, Sabu is estimated by the US government to have participated in more than 250 cyber attacks - causing up to $50 million worth of damages. Freedom: Computer hacker Hector Xavier Monsegur, aka 'Sabu', walks free out of Manhattan's Federal Court after his sentencing to time served in New York, May 27, 2014 . Informant: Hector Xavier Monsegur, flanked by members of his legal team, arrives at court in New York for a sentencing hearing on Tuesday, May 27, 2014 . 'That personal characteristic of turning on a dime and doing good and not evil is the most important factor in this sentence,' said Preska. But U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska imposed a term of seven months behind bars — equal to what he'd already served — which means Monsegur was a free man after his sentencing hearing in Manhattan federal court. Condemnation from those who Monsegur had betrayed was swift and strong. A spokesperson for Anonymous told the Guardian that 'Monsegur is, first and foremost, a criminal; the FBI’s cyber crime task force are his co-conspirators. While operating under their supervision, Monsegur committed numerous felonies which should in no way be excused due to his protected informant status.' Monsegur, wearing a black shirt, khaki pants and wire-rim glasses, nodded affirmatively while Preska described his assistance to the government. 'I assure you, I'm not the same person you saw three years ago,' Monsegur told the judge. 'I'm ready to move on.' According to a government sentencing memo filed on Friday, Monsegur's actions 'prevented at least millions of dollars in loss to to these victims.' Cooperation: Hector Xaviar Monsegur (L), the notorious hacker known as Sabu, is seen sitting between his defense attorneys Peggy Cross-Goldenberg and Philip Weinstein before his sentencing at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in this artist sketch in Lower Manhattan on May 27, 2014 . 'Monsegur's cooperation was complex and sophisticated, and the investigations in which he participated required close and precise coordination with law enforcement officers in several locations,' Manhattan Assistant U.S. Attorney James Pastore wrote in the memo according to USA Today. Monsegur began hacking from his Manhattan apartment in the early 2000s and used his computer skills to steal credit card information - allegedly stealing and causing up to $50 million worth of damage. In a 2011 interview with an online magazine, Monsegur said that he joined Anonymous because he was upset with the treatment and arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. In early 2011, using his Sabu alias, Monsegur set up the Anonymous splinter group called Lulz Security, or LulzSec, which hacked the computers of Fox, Nintendo and PayPal. Relaxed: Monsegur once led an Anonymous splinter group that stole information from Fox television, Nintendo and other businesses . When FBI agents showed up at Monsegur's home in the summer of 2011, he immediately agreed to cooperate. According . to a court filing by U.S. prosecutors, Monsegur, 30, and five other . members of Anonymous formed LulzSec, which engaged in hacks on companies . including Internet security firm HB Gary, News Corp's Fox Television, . Tribune Co and Sony Corp, as well as the website for the U.S. Senate. After the FBI approached him at his home in June 2011, Monsegur agreed to cooperate with law enforcement. Monsegur . secretly pleaded guilty to charges including computer hacking in August . 2011, a fact that did not become public until charges were announced . against five other hackers connected with LulzSec in 2012. Among those charged was Jeremy Hammond, a Chicago resident who at the time was the FBI's No.1 cyber criminal target. Hammond, . 29, was sentenced in November to 10 years in prison after pleading . guilty to cyber attacks on various government agencies and businesses. US . prosecutors said in the court filing that Monsegur's cooperation also . led to the prosecution of Matthew Keys, a former deputy social media . editor of Reuters.com. Keys has pleaded not guilty to charges that he aided members of Anonymous. Monsegur . also engaged in a 'significant undercover operation' that exposed an . unnamed subject's role in an existing investigation soliciting cyber . attacks on a foreign government, prosecutors said. No charges have . resulted in the case. Justice: The prosecutors also credit Hector Xavier Monsegur with helping cripple the group of so-called hacktivists known as Anonymous . The . roughly 300 computer hacks Monsegur helped prevent included targets . such as the U.S. Armed Forces, the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, . and NASA, prosecutors said. He . also provided information about vulnerabilities in critical . infrastructure such as a city's water utility and a foreign energy . company. While . U.S. authorities praised Monsegur's cooperation, they also said in the . court filing that contrary to rumor, Monsegur was not involved in the . prosecution of operators of Silk Road, an Internet black-market bazaar . that accepted Bitcoin.","Federal prosecutors in New York say hacker Hector Xavier Monsegur helped the FBI thwart hundreds of cyberattacks on government and corporate computer systems .

"By . Adam Duggan . Australian Apple users are having their devices hijacked and held to ransom by sophisticated hackers. Mac devices - including iPads, iPhones and computers - have reportedly been targeted overnight across New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. Worried users have posted their concerns to online support communities, looking for answers to the issue that is now costing them money. iJacked: Some apple users have reported having their phones locked and held to ransom early on Tuesday morning . Apple users were reportedly woken in the early hours of Tuesday morning to an alert on their devices - warning them they had been hacked by Oleg Pliss. The hacker is demanding money, before unlocking their devices. Melbourne iPad owner 'veritylikestea' posted to an Apple support forum that her iPad 'suddenly locked itself' on Tuesday morning. 'There was a message on the screen ... saying that my device(s) had been hacked by Oleg Pliss,' she told Australian Associated Press. Staying tight-lipped: Apple are keeping quiet on the security breach, despite mounting concern and anger on their own online support forum and technology website Whirlpool . The message demanded she pay US$100 (AU$108.20) through PayPal for her device to be unlocked. Other Apple users were reportedly woken up to alert noises on their devices, with similar messages popping up. Those who had their iPhones hacked have reported unhelpful service from major telecommunications companies and Apple. It's unclear how the hackers gained access to the devices, but some users are pointing to a breach of their iCloud accounts. Potentially a problem with the cloud: Despite it being unclear how the hackers accessed the devices, some online users are pointing to a security breach in the cloud . Hackers were likely to have activated a 'lost mode' on the devices, allowing them to be locked. IT security expert Troy Hunt told Fairfax that he believes it may have been a case of using the same password across multiple devices - meaning all of a person's accounts are vulnerable if a password is hacked. 'Regardless of how difficult someone believes a password is to guess, if it's been compromised in another service and exposed in an unencrypted fashion, then it puts every other service where it has been reused at risk. Of course it also suggests that two-factor authentication was likely not used as the password alone wouldn't have granted the attacker access to the iCloud account,' he said. MailOnline sought comment from Apple, Optus and Telstra.","Apple users woken early Tuesday to alert their device had been hacked .

"By . Meghan Keneally . A new study has revealed that students who do better academically in high school will go on to earn more money later in life. The findings prove that spending extra time on studies pays off for both sexes, but especially for teenage boys. A one-point difference in a student's grade point average could lead to a double-digit percentage pay increase. For young women, a boost in their GPA corresponds to a 13.77 per cent pay increase and men have an 11.85 per cent increase. Though young women have a higher boost, they are still lagging far behind their male peers in terms of pay overall- even though their GPA scores are 'significantly higher'. As a result, the research conducted by the University of Miami was split by sex but a side-by-side comparison of the pay by gender shows the dramatic gap that comes in spite of the fact that there are more young women who preformed better academically in high school. For example, young men who earned a 3.0 GPA made approximately $41,000 while young women earned about $36,000. By comparison, young men who scored a 4.0 made approximately $48,000 while young women who scored the same earned about $28,000. All of the salary data was taken from young a group of young professionals between 24 and 34 years old, and the research was based on their reported academic success. Hitting the books: Young men's salaries go up by nearly 12 per cent for each extra GPA point . Michael French, the University of Miami professor who led the research team, did not give any insight into the gender disparity, but did note some racial indicators. 'The results suggest that African-Americans with poor high school GPAs are less likely to graduate from high school and attend college, but once GPA and other factors are included in the models, they are actually more likely than other races to graduate from college and continue to graduate school,' Mr French said. 'One possible explanation for this finding is that African-Americans with relatively high GPAs are more motivated and determined than whites to attend college and obtain an advanced degree.' The concept behind the study- that those who are stronger academically will go on to succeed in professional life- does not come as a shock but this is the first research of its kind. 'Conventional wisdom is that academic performance in high school is important for college admission, but this is the first study to clearly demonstrate the link between high school GPA and labor market earnings many years later,' professor French said in a release. 'High school guidance counselors and teachers can use these findings to highlight the importance of doing well in high school for both short term (college admission) and longer term (earnings as an adult) goals.'","University of Miami study notes that there are far more female high school students who earn 4.0 GPAs but doesn't follow in terms of salary .

"By . Associated Press . and Alexandra Klausner . Starbucks is dipping its toe into the burger business, with plans to open an outpost of its La Boulange chain that caters to the dinner crowd. A spokeswoman for Starbucks, Linda Mills, said the Los Angeles restaurant is scheduled to open on June 12 and will be open until 10 p.m. It will also serve beer, wine, cocktails and milkshakes. Starbucks Corp. had purchased the La Boulange chain of bakery-cafes in 2012. The cafes are based in San Francisco Bay Area and primarily focus on breakfast and lunch with soups, salads and sandwiches, along with baked goods. Those cafes typically close before 7 p.m. La Boulange will open in Los Angeles on June 12 and will stay open until 10 p.m. serving items such as croissant burgers along with beer and wine . The . location in Los Angeles will be the first outside of the San Francisco . area and will have more of a 'modern farmhouse' feel to it, Mills said. Many of the bakery items will be the same, but the menu will be . significantly expanded to include build-your-own-burgers and other . dishes designed for dinner. It's just Starbucks' latest experiment with formats beyond its namesake cafes. After . acquiring a chain of packaged tea stores called Teavana, for instance, . the company last year opened an outpost in New York City modeled more . after a pricey cafe that serves small bites and prepared tea drinks.

"By . Chris Pleasance . and Hanna Flint . Actor Seth Rogen has slated a film critic for suggesting movies such as Neighbors were partly to blame for Elliot Rodger's shooting spree in Santa Barbara. The actor hit out at Washington Post writer Ann Hornaday who suggested in a recent article that 'outsized frat-boy fantasies' like the film encouraged the Santa Barbara suspect, who left six people dead and 13 injured last week in a deadly rampage after he revealed he was tired of being ignored by girls at college. Venting his frustration on Twitter, Rogen called the article 'horribly insulting and misinformed', adding: 'How dare you imply that me getting girls in movies caused a lunatic to go on a rampage.' Scroll down for video . Seth Rogen has taken to Twitter to blast Ann Hornaday, a film critic for the Washington Post, who suggested in an article that films like Neighbors were partly to blame for Elliot Rodger's shooting spree . In the film Neighbors, called Bad Neighbours in the UK, Rogen plays a new father who goes to war with the frat house next door after complaining about their constant partying . Judd Apatow also weighed in, accusing Hornaday of promoting herself using tragedy, instead blaming Rodger's killings on the fact that he was mentally ill. In a column for the Washington Post, Hornaday asked: 'How many men, . raised on a steady diet of Judd Apatow comedies in which the shlubby . arrested adolescent always gets the girl, find that those happy endings . constantly elude them and conclude, “It’s not fair”?' She conceded that Rodger had been mentally unstable, but added that his delusions 'were inflated, if not created, by the entertainment industry he grew up in.' Hornaday also attack Judd Apatow films, such as Superbad, for promoting fantasies of adolescents getting the girl which leads young men to feel 'it isn't fair' when their lives fall short. Apatow also used Twitter to criticise her article . Apatow accused Hornaday of using the tragedy to promote herself, and of ignoring Rodger's mental illness . Elliot, 22, who was the son of 'Hunger Games' second unit director Peter Rodger, detailed his chilling plans to murder women in a 141-page manifesto and in a six-minute video, in which attacked women for ignoring him and men for having fun a sex while he 'rotted in loneliness'. Hornaday blamed a male-dominated film industry for promoting films full of 'violence, sexual conquest and macho swagger' which change harmless male fantasies into 'dangerous lies' which young men compare their own lives against. Hornaday has been with the Washington Post since 2002 after previous stints at the New York Times and Baltimore Sun, and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in criticism in 2008. Superbad, a Judd Apatow film, follows three teenagers through the last weeks of high school as they try to sleep with popular girls by buying enough alcohol to get them drunk at a house party . In Neighbors (called Bad Neghbours in the UK), Rogen plays new father Mac Radner alongside Rose Byrne as wife Kelly, who move in to a new neighborhood only to find a frat house has moved in next door. After Mac calls the police due to the fraternity's constant partying, the two go to war, trying to out-prank one another.","Ann Hornaday used Washington Post article to attack Rogen's new film .

"By . Associated Press . A TV producer is seeking teenagers as young as 13 who like to make their own rules and 'party like a rock star' to participate in a reality television series about their lives. A Los Angeles-based casting company, Metal Flowers Media, placed a notice about the series 'My Teen Life' in Backstage, a publication widely followed by entertainment professionals for job leads. The company said producers of 'The Real Housewives of New York City' are looking for boys and girls ages 13 to 18 to cast. 'Parents, teachers and the haters are always in your business, but it's your life and you live it how you want to,' the ad said. 'If you're a modern-day teenage rebel with a hardcore lifestyle, we want to hear your story.' Wild: A television producer is seeking young teens who have a wild lifestyle and do what they want for a show similar to Buckwild (pictured). Psychologists called the show 'a poor idea' The casting notice had an advertisement attached that includes this message: '(expletive) parents. They're old and don't know (expletive). It's 4:20 and time for your friend Molly to tell your story.' Molly is the name of a synthetic drug popular with many young fans of electronic dance music. An employee at Metal Flowers Media said last Friday the company had wrapped casting for the proposed series. Ad for 'My Teen Life' The person, . who declined to give her name, said Metal Flowers isn't involved with . the show's production and the project now was out of the casting . company's hands. She didn't provide casting details and she didn't know the production company behind the idea. Metal Flowers isn't customarily informed if a pilot it has cast is picked up as a series and was unaware of its status, she said. There is no . such series in the works at Shed Media US, which produces 'The Real . Housewives of New York City,' said Jon Marcus, the company's senior vice . president of development. It's possible that someone who once worked at 'Real Housewives' is involved, but he said he was unaware of the project. New show: The producers of 'The Real Housewives of New York City' (the cast is pictured) are looking for boys and girls ages 13 to 18 to cast for the new show, 'My Teen Life', according to an ad . Shed has . produced a range of unscripted series including 'Hollywood Exes' and . 'Basketball Wives' on VH1, 'SuperNanny' on ABC and 'Bethenny Ever After' on Bravo. Posting: The ad appeared in Backstage, which gives entertainment industry job leads . Similarly, the Metal Flowers Media . website lists more than 100 programs that it has helped find . participants, including 'Naked & Afraid' on Discovery, 'Top Guns' on . History, '1000 Ways to Die' on Spike and 'Storage Wars' on A&E. Bravo said it hasn't commissioned 'My Teen Life' or any series like it. There's certainly a market for television about young people behaving badly, as MTV learned with the success of 'Buckwild,' a series about hard-living West Virginia residents that ended abruptly last year following the death of a cast member. 'I think parents will be incensed at this kind of thing,' said Stanley Goldstein, a psychologist from Middletown, New York, and author of 'Troubled Children/Troubled Parents: The Way Out'. Many young people - and perhaps their parents - would not have the insight to understand what being put in such a television spotlight could mean for their lives, he said. Producers would at least face questions about a series if it glamorizes drug and alcohol use by underage participants. It sounds like producers are setting themselves up for a lawsuit, Goldstein said. 'It's a poor idea,' he said. 'It doesn't show great sophistication. But then again, a lot of television doesn't.'","LA casting company placed an ad in Backstage magazine asking for boys and girls aged 13 to 18 to apply to the show, 'My Teen Life'

"By . Alexandra Klausner . Recent studies show that many American women have too little iodine and if pregnant, is a deficiency that may affect their child's brain development. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday, iodine is essential to babies' brain development and a lack of it can hinder a child's ability to live to his or her full potential. NBC reports that in the past, the iodine problem was solved by adding iodine to table salt. Iodine deficiencies in the U.S. due to the popularity of processed foods is leaving some women with a lack of the mineral that can lower their child's IQ . Unfortunately, iodine is no longer a part of the common American diet as most of the salt consumed in the U.S. comes from processed foods, said pediatrician Dr.Jerome Paulson. Women who are vegan and who don't eat fish are also likely to have an iodine deficiency. Even though an iodine deficiency affects a child's brain, it isn't likely that it will cause a learning disability. 'The brain development issues are very subtle and are not likely to be noticed in an individual child,' Paulson explained. 'It's an issue for society as a whole when you have a large number of children who are not reaching their full potential.' Paulson said that children will appear to be normal but that they may not be the greatest they could be. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, iodine is essential to babies' brain development and taking anywhere from 150- 290 micrograms per day can higher a child's IQ . According to the New York Daily News, Whether or not a woman has an iodine deficiency doesn't dictate whether or not she should take a supplement. In fact, all pregnant mothers and women of child bearing age are urged to take a dose of the mineral. Pregnant woman should take 220 micrograms a day and breastfeeding moms should take up to 290 micrograms . In addition to taking iodine, women should also take vitamin D in their prenatal vitamin regimen. 'I think the main thing is that the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] should make sure that prenatal vitamins contain all the essential nutrients,' Garibaldi said. 'It's very important that vitamins such as Vitamin D which is useful in calcifying bones, and elements such as iodine be part of prenatal vitamins.' Pediatricians say an iodine deficiency can also increase a mother and her baby's vulnerability to tobacco and certain chemicals in drinking water.","Iodine is essential to babies' brain development and a lack .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . The bodies of 40 Confederate soldiers unearthed in the last two months will have a proper memorial around 150 years after they fought during the Civil War. Ted Delaney, the assistant director of Old City Cemetery in Lynchburg Virginia, along with a team of archeologists also found the areas where Union Soldiers were buried and then disinterred in 1866. Delany told reporters that his team discovered an area of the cemetery called 'Yankee Square' that had both red and orange squares that he deemed were Confederate soldiers' graves. Now, some 150 years after the Civil War, the bodies of 40 Confederate soldiers discovered at Old City Cemetery over the past two months will receive a proper memorial . Archeologists are hoping to identify Confederate soldiers (pictured ca. 1861-1865) around 150 years after they fought during the Civil War . In early April the team dug a 45-by-10 foot trench to dig up the bodies and now face the challenge of identifying each grave and giving them the recognition they deserve. 'Our goal is to put a marker at each grave space to identify the soldier and note when he died and his military unit,' said Delaney . 'The undertaker's notes are so detailed and complete,' he added, confident that at least 80 soldiers would be properly identified. 'This has been an incredible process of discovery,' he told Fox News. 'It’s always been very frustrating for those descendents who come to us because they can't find their ancestor's grave. Now we can bring some of them closure.' 'Yankee Square' was originally intended to be a burial site for just Union soldiers but later included Confederate soldiers many of whom died from small pox and other diseases. Delaney and his team have been awarded an annual grant of $2,500 from the Virginia Department of Historic Records for their work. Their remains sat, unmarked, in shallow graves at the Old City Cemetery until recently when they were unearthed and will hopefully be identified . Ted Delaney along with a team of archaeologists, uncovered the exact resting place of some 40 Confederate soldiers as well as the plots where Union soldiers were once buried and later exhumed . Delaney and his archeologists were not the only ones to discover unidentified Civil War graves during the last few years. Sam Ricks, the graves registrar for the Sons of Confederate Veterans', uncovered unmarked graves at Mount Mariah Cemetery along with his crew recently. The 380 acre historic cemetery which spans from Philadelphia and Yeadon, Pennsylvania called Mount Moriah cemetery houses graves of 2,300 Marines and Navy service members dating from the Revolutionary War to the War of 1812 all the way to the Korean and Vietnam wars. Ricks made a discovery in 2008 after being approached by a relative of a cadet from the Virginia Military Institute, Nathan Tiernon Walton a year earlier. Walton, along with 194 cadets, fought the Battle of New Market in Virginia for the Confederate Army on May 15, 1864. Walton later left his wife and daughter in Baltimore to find work in Atlanta and Philadelphia and became estranged from his relatives. The cemetery not only housed the graves of Confederate soldiers (pictured here) but also of Union soldiers . 'He was a recluse,' Ricks said, 'And no one ever knew what became of him.' Walton's family believed that he was buried in Baltimore along with his wife, but Walton's great-grandson, Bill Banks, found no evidence that Walton was buried in Loudon Park Cemetary. Fox reports that Banks continues a search started by his grandmother 100 years ago to find his great-grandfathers grave. They later discovered that Walton died in the Great Influenza Pandemic or 1918. In November 2008, both Ricks and Walton's family were able to mark Walton's grave with a large cast iron Southern Cross passed down by Walton's daughter. 'I'm reminded of this case every Memorial Day,' Ricks said. 'Walton's daughter had handed down to generations a marker to be placed at his grave should it ever be found. And then we actually did it. We fulfilled her wish.'","Ted Delaney, the assistant director of Old City Cemetery in Lynchburg Virginia, along with a team of archeologists discovered the bodies .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A group of students have discovered a 7,000-year-old mummy while on a field trip in northern Chile. La Tercera newspaper reported that the ground-breaking find was made by chance on Saturday during a visit to the Morro de Arica site by local students. The children, who are at-risk youths enrolled in an archeology workshop, were performing excavation work when one found a strange shape under dog droppings. Ancient archeological artifacts have been forced toward the surface following the powerful 8.2 earthquake that rocked the region in April, reports say. A group of students unearthed a 7,000-year-old mummy belonging to the great Inca predecessor - Chinchorro culture - during a trip to northern Chile . Trip organizer Hans Neira said the discovery of the mummy, part of the Chinchorro culture, showed that the area should be declared a protected zone. To the Chinchorro, deliberate preservation of their dead by means of mummification appears to have been a deeply religious act—a study in devotion. They likely believed that mummies were the bridge between the world of the living and the supernatural realm of the dead. What makes the Chinchorro so remarkable is the elaborate way in which they prepared their loved ones for the hereafter. 'Chinchorro mummies are one of the wonders of Andean archaeology and of mortuary studies anywhere in the world,' exclaims Karen Wise of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, who is excavating a cemetery at Ilo, Peru. What makes it all different from the Chinchorro culture is the fact that ancient Egypt saw exclusively kings and queens worth of mummification, unlike in Peru. Surprisingly, the Chinchorro community accorded everyone, regardless of age or status, this sacred rite, deeply honoring the dead and death as such. The Arica-Camarones area represents the bedrock of the Chinchorro culture, then the cemetery at El Morro is its mother lode: no other site in the region has yielded a larger or better preserved collection of artificial mummies so far. The practice came along by far earlier than that of the ancient Incas -  6,000 years before, to be exact. Chinchorro culture culminating from 7020 BC to 1500 BC consists of fishermen villages scattered along the coast of Atacama desert, from Ilo in Peru in the north to Antofagasta in the south.","Find was made on Saturday at the Morro de Africa site in northern Chile .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Shelly Sterling will accept offers this week to buy the LA Clippers after meeting with potential buyer Steve Ballmer on Sunday, it has been claimed. Ballmer, a former Microsoft CEO thought to be worth $20billion (£11.8billion), is leading a group of investors looking to buy the sports franchise and reportedly spoke with Sterling on Sunday in a meeting overseen by the NBA. Shelly has committed to offloading the team, which could be worth $1.5billion, after her husband Donald was recorded making racist remarks leading to the NBA banning him from the league. Shelly Sterling is looking to do a deal over the LA Clippers this week, it has been reported. She was handed control of the franchise after husband Donald was banned from the NBA . Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, reported to be worth $20billion, is thought to be the frontrunner in talks after reportedly meeting with Shelly on Sunday . According to TMZ sports, Shelly and her lawyer Pierce O'Donnell have told potential buyers they are looking to do a deal this week, and NBA commissioner Adam Silver is aware of their intentions. Ballmer is the frontrunner, but other interested parties are thought to include the Grant Hill Group -  a collection of investors lead by former NBA star Hill - and Magic Johnson and the Guggenheim partners - a financial investment group from Chicago, lead by another basketball great. Patrick Soon-Shiong, a surgeon, professor and billionaire businessman, is also rumoured to be interested, as is music and cinema executive David Geffen and software magnate Larry Ellison. Ballmer's apparent lead in securing a deal has worried some Clippers fans, who fear the Seattle-based billionaire could move the team up north. He previously tried to move the Sacramento Kings to the emerald city after putting in a failed bid in 2009, and tried to keep the Sonics in Seattle in 2008 with another purchase which ultimately failed. However Shelly has previously said she would not be willing to sell the franchise to anyone considering moving it out of LA, and Ballmer has sought to reassure fans by saying he has no plans to relocated the Clippers. He said: 'If the opportunity is outside of Seattle, so be it. I will learn . about any team that comes up for sale at this point. Music and film executive David Geffen (left) and Orcale CEO Larry Ellison (right) are thought to be among investors trying to buy the basketball franchise . Former NBA star Magic Johnson is leading a group of Chicago-based investors to bid for the Clippers . 'If I get interested in the Clippers, it would be . for Los Angeles. I don't work anymore, so I have more geographic . flexibility than I did a year, year-and-a half ago. Moving them anywhere . else would be value-destructive.' The . news comes after the NBA stated on Friday that it would go through with . a June 3 hearing to terminate Donald Sterling's ownership following his . lifetime ban. Previously, the league stated a sale would only be considered if Shelly chose to sell it in its entirety. The sale will be handled by Sterling's attorney Pierce O'Donnell in partnership with Bob Baradan.","Shelly Sterling reportedly looking to do deal over LA Clippers this week .

"By . Jill Reilly . Pope Francis has branded the sexual abuse of children by priests an ugly crime comparable to a 'satanic Mass' saying he would show zero tolerance for anyone in the Catholic Church who abused children, including bishops. Speaking on the plane taking him back from a visit to the Middle East, the pope also announced that he would have his first meeting with a group of abuse victims at the Vatican early next month. 'Sexual abuse is such an ugly crime ... because a priest who does this betrays the body of the Lord. It is like a satanic Mass,' he said in some of the toughest language he has used on a crisis that has rocked the Church for more than a decade. Scroll down to see video . Pope Francis talks with Vatican Spokseman Father Federico Lombardi, right, during a press conference he held aboard the papal flight on his way back to Rome . On the flight he announced he would meet soon with a group of sex abuse victims at the Vatican and declared 'zero tolerance' for any member of the clergy who would violate a child . 'We must go ahead with zero tolerance,' he said, adding that three bishops were currently under investigation. Francis said he would meet with eight victims and Cardinal Sean Patrick O'Malley of Boston, who is head of a commission set up to study ways of dealing with the crisis. Speaking to reporters for nearly an hour on the plane taking him back from a visit to the Middle East, the pope looked alert despite the gruelling three-day trip and overruled his spokesman who suggested the airborne news conference should be cut short to all him to rest. A fire was started at the Dormition Abbey, a Catholic sanctuary atop Mount Zion in Jerusalem's old city . Pope . Francis and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu traded words on . Monday over the language spoken by Jesus two millennia ago. 'Jesus . was here, in this land. He spoke Hebrew,' Mr Netanyahu told Francis, at . a public meeting in Jerusalem in which the Israeli leader cited a . strong connection between Judaism and Christianity. 'Aramaic,' the pope interjected. 'He spoke Aramaic, but he knew Hebrew,' Netanyahu shot back. Like many things in the Middle East, . where the pope is on the last leg of a three-day visit, modern-day . discourse about Jesus is complicated and often political. Jesus was born in Bethlehem in the Roman-ruled region of Judea, now the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He grew up in Nazareth and ministered in Galilee, both in northern Israel, and died in Jerusalem, a city revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims, and to which Israelis and Palestinians lay claim. Palestinians sometimes describe Jesus as a Palestinian. Israelis object to that. Israeli . linguistics professor Ghil'ad Zuckermann says that both . Netanyahu, son of a distinguished Jewish historian, and the pope, the . spiritual leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, have a point. 'Jesus was a native Aramaic speaker, 'he said about the largely defunct Semitic language closely related to Hebrew. 'But he would have also known Hebrew because there were extant religious writings in Hebrew.' Zuckermann said that during Jesus' time, Hebrew was spoken by the lower classes - 'the kind of people he ministered to'. Francis said the victims, several from Europe, would attend his morning Mass and then he would meet with them. It will be the first time for Francis to meet sexual abuse victims since his election in March 2013. It . was not clear, however, if the pope also meant zero tolerance for . bishops who are not accused of being abusers themselves but who are . accused of having turned a blind eye to abuse by priests in their . dioceses or who may have covered up abuse scandals. O'Malley . said last month in Rome that the commission he heads will recommend . that negligent clerics be held accountable regardless of their rank in . the Church. In . many cases of abuse, most of which took place decades ago but surfaced . in the past 15 years or so, bishops seeking to protect the Church's . reputation moved priests from parish to parish instead of defrocking . them or handing them over to police. Victims' groups have pressed the Vatican to hold bishops who either shielded . abusers or were negligent in protecting children to account, along with . abusers themselves. The . executive director of the main U.S. victims' group, Survivors Network . of Those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, dismissed the meeting as 'just . utterly, utterly meaningless.' 'The . simple truth is this is another gesture, another public relations coup, . another nice bit of symbolism that will leave no child better off and . bring no real reform to a continuing, scandal-ridden church hierarchy,' said SNAP Executive Director David Clohessy. Clohessy . said the pope has shown himself capable of making real change in other . areas such as church governance and finance but hasn't done so in . dealing with sex abuse by Catholic clergy. But . a U.S. attorney who represents clergy abuse victims hoped the meeting . would be 'substantive and meaningful' rather than for cosmetic purposes. attorney Mitchell Garabedian said 'meeting directly with victims is the . most powerful tool that the pope can use in understanding the ugliness . and horror of clergy sexual abuse and why it must be stopped or . prevented.' In . February, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child . accused the Vatican of systematically turning a blind eye to decades of . abuse and attempting to cover up sex crimes. The Vatican called the report unfair and ideologically slanted. Francis spoke to reporters for nearly an hour, taking all 11 questions posed and responding with candor and occasional humor. He said he would travel to Sri Lanka for two days and the Philippines in January 2015. And he suggested that he might follow in emeritus Pope Benedict XVI's footsteps and retire if he no longer had the strength to do the job. 'We need to . look at him as an institution: he opened a door, the door of emeritus . popes,' Francis said. 'Only God knows if there will be others, but the . door is open.' If . and when the time comes, he said, 'I will do what the Lord tells me to . do, pray and try to find God's will. But I think that Benedict XVI . wasn't a unique case.' Francis . sought to lower expectations about his planned encounter in the Vatican . next month with the Israeli and Palestinian presidents, which he . announced during the trip. He stressed that they were coming to pray . together, not enter into peace mediation. 'We are coming just to pray, then everyone goes home,' he said. 'But I think prayer is important, praying together.' Israel's President Shimon Peres looks on as Pope Francis greets children with cancer from the Make-A-Wish Foundation at Peres' residence . Pope Francis places an envelope in on of the cracks between the stones of the Western Wall . He said he had originally hoped to arrange the encounter in Jerusalem itself, but that the idea was scrapped because of the enormous logistical problems that would have been involved. Preparations are already under way, he said, noting that a rabbi and Islamic cleric would join him in leading the prayers. One of the more poignant moments of Francis' pilgrimage came Monday when he visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem and kissed the hands of survivors in a show of humility and respect. Francis said his gesture came spontaneously. 'The gestures that are the most authentic you don't think about,' ahead of time, he said. Given his respect for Holocaust survivors, Francis was asked what he intended to do about the pending beatification case for Pope Pius XII, the World War II-era pope accused by some Jews of not speaking out enough against the Holocaust. Jewish groups have asked that the case be shelved pending the opening of the archives of his pontificate, or at least until the generation of Holocaust survivors has passed. Francis has bent the Vatican's saint-making rules for a half-dozen people so far in his pontificate, waiving the usual second miracle requirement for example to canonize Pope John XXIII last month. Francis, however, offered no such wiggle room for Pius. 'There's still no miracle,' he said. 'If there are no miracles, it can't go forward. It's blocked there.' Just hours after Pope Francis left a fire broke out at Dormition Abbey, a Catholic sanctuary atop Mount Zion in Jerusalem's old city. The fire, started by a suspected arsonist, damaged a guest book at the Jerusalem holy site marking the location of Jesus' last supper.","Speaking to reporters on the plane taking him back from a Middle East visit .

"By . Associated Press . A widely-used germ-killing ingredient in soaps, deodorants and even toothpaste has been banned in Minnesota over fears that the chemical has a negative effect on users health and the environment. Governor Mark Dayton on Friday signed a bill to make Minnesota the first state to prohibit the use of triclosan in most retail consumer hygiene products. Triclosan is used in an estimated 75 per cent of anti-bacterial liquid soaps and body washes sold across the United States, according to the Food and Drug Administration. The federal agency announced last year that it would revisit the safety of triclosan and other germ-killing ingredients used in personal cleaning products. Making a move: Triclosan is used in an estimated 75 per cent of anti-bacterial liquid soaps and body washes sold across the United States but now Minnesota wants to ban its use . While triclosan hasn't been shown to be hazardous to humans, studies have raised concerns that it can disrupt hormones critical for reproduction and development, at least in lab animals, and contribute to the development of resistant bacteria. Action: Governor Mark Dayton signed a bill enacting the ban but it will not go into effect until 2017 . The Minnesota ban isn't due to take effect until January 1, 2017 but one of its lead sponsors, state senator John Marty, predicted Monday that the odds are good that most manufacturers will phase out triclosan by then anyway. Mr Marty, a Democrat, said other states and the federal government are likely to act, too. He added that some companies are already catching on that there's no marketing advantage to keeping triclosan in its products, citing how Procter & Gamble's Crest toothpaste is now marketing itself as triclosan-free. Critics including the FDA say there's no evidence that triclosan soaps are any more effective than washing with plain soap and water for preventing the spread of diseases. A University of Minnesota study published last year found increasing levels of triclosan in the sediments of several lakes, and that the chemical can break down in those waters into potentially harmful dioxins. Two months later, Dayton ordered all state agencies to stop buying hand soaps and dish and laundry cleaners containing triclosan. The American Cleaning Institute had urged Dayton to veto the new bill, saying triclosan has been thoroughly researched and shown to provide important health benefits. 'Instead of letting federal regulators do their jobs, the legislation would take safe, effective and beneficial products off the shelves of Minnesota grocery, convenience and drug stores,' Douglas Troutman, the trade group's vice president and counsel for governmental affairs, wrote in a letter to Dayton. ACI spokesman Brian Sansoni said Minnesota is the only state to enact a ban so far. He said it remains to be seen whether any individual manufacturers would go to the expense of reformulating their products just for the Minnesota market or simply stop selling them in the state. He said triclosan is an issue best regulated at the federal level. Key ingredient: While triclosan hasn't been shown to be hazardous to humans, studies have raised concerns that it can disrupt hormones critical for reproduction and development, at least in lab animals, and contribute to the development of resistant bacteria . Under an FDA rule proposed in December, manufacturers of anti-bacterial hand soaps and body washes would have to demonstrate that their products are safe for daily use, and more effective than plain soap and water. Otherwise, they would need to reformulate these products or remove anti-bacterial claims from the labels. The agency is still taking public comments on the proposal. Some manufacturers have announced plans over the last couple years to at least partially phase out triclosan. Procter & Gamble plans to finish dropping the chemical from its products this year. Johnson & Johnson plans to eliminate it from all its consumer products by 2015.","Triclosan is an chemical with antibiotic properties and is used in 75 per cent of all liquid soap and body washes .

"By . Associated Press . Authorities called off the search for three ranchers today, who disappeared after a huge mudslide in a remote part of western Colorado. Mesa County Sheriff Stan Hilkey said the slide remained too unstable to continue looking for the men, identified as Clancy Nichols, 51, a county road and bridge employee; Danny Nichols, 24, Clancy Nichols' son; and Wes Hawkins, 46. The three men were checking on problems with an irrigation ditch caused by an initial slide Sunday when a second, much larger slide hit. Authorities say the slide is a half-mile long and about three miles long. Scroll down for video . Wreckage: Hundreds of trees are knocked down where a massive mudslide happened near Collbran, Colorado . Damage: the aftermath of the Mesa County mudslide is seen from a plane on Monday nearly Collbran, Colorado . Hilkey said another slide is still possible. 'We're . not able to do what we would like to do,' the sheriff said. 'What we . would like to do is have every inch of this covered with people if we . could. But we don't want to create any more of a tragedy than we already . have.' The three men - a county road worker, his son and another man - were all from the close-knit town of Collbran. They volunteered to investigate when a rancher noticed his irrigation ditch stopped running. The smaller mudslide was found to be to blame for the water cutoff. When the men went to check on the damage, a huge chunk of the ridge sheared off, likely overwhelming them. Hilkey has said the slide was most likely triggered by runoff from Grand Mesa following two days of strong rain. Three people are missing after a massive mudslide on Grand Mesa, pictured, in western Colorado . No . structures or roads were affected in the remote area, about an hour . east of Grand Junction. A drone was used to try to detect heat sources . from the missing near the edge of Grand Mesa, one of the world's highest . flat topped mountains. The . Mesa County Sheriff's Office identified the missing men and Clancy . Nichols' brother, Bill, says he's holding out hope they survived the . slide. 'We're praying for . their safety', he told KUSA-TV. 'We're praying for the safe return of . the family members of Wes' family and for Clancy and Danny to come . back.' Hawkins' cousin, Bill . Clark, said yesterday he went along with Clancy and Danny Nichols to . check on why an irrigation ditch had stopped flowing because he works . for an area water district. He said he has a family and young children. Clark, . who visited the canyon where the slide struck, said it was completely . filled with mud. He said the slide struck with so much force that some . also spilled over into the neighboring draw. 'I've never seen so much earth move like that in my life,' he said. From . a distance of about 10 miles, the slide looked like a funnel, narrowing . into a culvert below. It cut a giant channel through trees. The creek . that once gradually flowed down the ridge now spurted down like a . waterfall. Roads in the area, where some cattle grazed, were muddy from . rain. Like a freight train: The mudslide came down just to the east of Grand Junction in Colorado on Sunday evening . 'How in the devil could this happen?' said Collbran resident Lloyd Power, gazing out at the slide. While . the surrounding area is popular place for fishing, hiking and camping, . the slide hit on land with an access gate that isn't open to the public. No one else is believed missing and no homes were damaged. Energy . companies were monitoring oil and gas wells in the area, part of the . productive Piceance Basin, but so far the mud has only come up to the . edge of one pad operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp. The three wells . there have been shut down, said David Ludlam, executive director of the . West Slope Colorado Oil & Gas Association, a trade group. Hilkey . said he'd received a telephone call from authorities in Washington . state, where a March 22 landslide swept a square mile of dirt, sand and . silt through a neighborhood in Oso, about an hour northeast of Seattle. That slide leveled homes and killed at least 43 people. The . Mesa County sheriff's department estimated the slide is about 4 miles . long, 2 miles wide and about 250 feet deep in many places. 'This slide is unbelievably big,' Mesa County Lt. Phil Stratton said. The site is in a . rural part of the county and there were no reports of any structures . damaged or major roads affected, McCammon said. A . unified incident command was established between Plateau Valley . Fire Department and the Mesa sheriff, to handle the slide and search for . the people possibly caught in it.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . The crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has been given permission to build an underground 'ice wall', it has been revealed. The wall, approved by the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA), will freeze soil around four reactors at the plant in northern Japan. It aims to prevent radioactive water from escaping the site - as well as blocking groundwater from nearby hillsides flowing into the area. Approved: The crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has been given permission to build an underground 'ice wall', it has been revealed. The wall will freeze soil around four reactors at the power plant in northern Japan . The project, proposed by Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO), will cost the Japanese Government an estimated 32billion Yen (£186million), according to the Japan Times. And there will be no hanging around - with workers expected to start building the wall next month. It comes despite concerns about the move - with the NRA previously expressing fears that the frozen wall could cause the surrounding ground to sink. But yesterday, the agency accepted TEPCO's comment that although the ground may sink up to 16mm in some areas, it will not be significant enough to cause safety concerns. Test: Tokyo Electric Power Co workers install the frozen wall at the site during a feasibility test in early May . Speaking after the approval, NRA commissioner Toyoshi Fuketa told Kyodo News: 'I think we have been able to confirm today the scale of ground . sinking, which is what we have most feared as side effects of building . the wall.' But Mr Fuketa said other issues surrounding the project - including ways to measure the level of radioactive water inside the reactor buildings - are yet to be discussed. The wall, stretching 1.5km (0.9miles) and nearly 100 feet deep, will be set up around reactors 1 to 4 at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, which suffered multiple meltdowns following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Crippled: The wall, approved by the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA), aims to prevent radioactive water from escaping the damaged site. It also strives to block groundwater from nearby hillsides flowing into the area . Workers will insert a line of pipes into the ground that circulate liquid as cold as -40C - causing the earth around them to freeze. As well as preventing polluted water from escaping the plant, the wall will also block groundwater from flowing into the buildings' basements and mixing with highly radioactive water leaks from the melted cores. Construction of the frozen wall is expected to finish in March next year, according to The Verge. As part of the project, TEPCO is also . installing another groundwater drainage system around the reactor . buildings, which some experts say could serve as a sufficient . alternative to the wall. Earlier this month, Dale Klein, a former U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission chairman who now heads a supervisory panel for TEPCO, said he was not convinced the 'ice wall' is the best way to prevent radioactive water from escaping the plant. He also claimed the Government and TEPCO should review the plan to balance risk and benefit to see whether they should spend the money elsewhere. 'Any time you make a decision, it should . be based on current, relevant science, and you have to strike a balance . between science and policy,' he said. 'At the end of the day, it may be a good alternative. But I'm just not convinced.' Still recovering: The Fukushima Dai-ichi plant suffered multiple meltdowns following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Above, smoke is pictured rising from reactor 3 at the nuclear power plant on March 21, 2011 . More than three years after the March 2011 meltdowns, the Fukushima plant is still plagued by a massive amount of contaminated water. Repeated water leaks from storage tanks and other mishaps have hampered a decommissioning effort that is expected to take decades. They have also caused environmental concerns among local fishermen.","Underground 'ice wall' was approved by the Nuclear Regulation Authority .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden did a sit down with American mainstream media for the first time last week and a clip is now online. In the interview set to air on Wednesday night, NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams speaks to the former NSA contractor who leaked classified information about the U.S.'s surveillance a year ago. Mr Williams travelled to Moscow, Russia, where Mr Snowden holds temporary asylum since last year, and spent several hours quizzing him. SCROLL FOR VIDEO . Back in the limelight: NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden will appear in his first interview with mainstream American TV this week . The exclusive interview, to be aired as an hour-long NBC special, is the latest media appearance by Mr Snowden, following a videolink speech at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival, a TED Conference in March and an interview in Vanity Fair's May issue. Also appearing on the NBC special is Glenn Greenwald, the Pulitzer prize winning journalist who broke the NSA surveillance story in the Guardian. Snowden’s interview comes after the House moved the U.S. closer to ending theNSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone records last Thursday. It is the most significant demonstration to date of Snowden's impact on the debate over privacy versus security. But the final version of the legislation, ‘watered down’ in the words of one supporter, also showed the limits of that impact. Interview: NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams travelled to Moscow, Russia, where Mr Snowden holds temporary asylum since last year, and spent several hours quizzing him . Exclusive: The hour long interview is set to air on Wednesday night, and may give a further insight into Snowden's future plans . The bill was severely weakened to mollify U.S. intelligence agencies, which insisted that the surveillance programs that shocked many Americans are a critical bulwark against terror plots. The bill was approved 303-121, which means that most House members can now say they voted to end what many critics consider the most troubling practice Snowden disclosed — the collection and storage of U.S. calling data by the secretive intelligence agency. But almost no other major provision designed to restrict NSA surveillance, including limits on the secret court that grants warrants to search the data, survived the negotiations to get the bill to the House floor. And even the prohibition on bulk collection of Americans' communications records has been called into question by some activists who say a last-minute change in wording diminished what was sold as a ban. ‘People will say, “We did something, and isn't something enough”,‘ said Steven Aftergood, who tracks intelligence issues for the Federation of American Scientists. ‘But this bill doesn't fundamentally resolve the uncertainties that generated the whole controversy.’ Though some privacy activists continued to back the bill, others withdrew support, as did technology companies such as Google and Facebook.","Edward Snowden's interview with NBC to air on Wednesday and the first clip has been put online .

"By . David Mccormack . The senseless killing spree by Elliot Rodger that left six others dead and another 13 wounded isn’t the first tragedy to befall the coastal community of Isla Vista near the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). The horrifying events of Friday night have chilling parallels with a 2001 incident when a UCSB freshman ran down and killed four pedestrians. On Feb 23 2001, David Attias drove his Saab at 60 mph into a large crowd in Isla Vista. He then jumped on top of his vehicle, held both arms in a boxing stance and declared, ‘I’m the angel of death.’ Elliot Rodger's senseless killing spree isn't the first tragedy to befall the coastal community of Isla Vista, in 2001 David Attias, right, killed four people after driving his car into a crowd and declaring 'I'm the angel of death' People pay their respects at a make-shift memorial set up outside the Alpha Phi sorority where two women died during the deadly shooting rampage at the college town of Isla Vista on Friday . His victims were Nicholas Shaw Bourdakis, Christopher Divis, both 20, Ruth Levy, 20, and 27-year-old Ellie Israel. Another victim, Albert Levy, was permanently injured. Attias was arrested and charged with murder, although in 2002 a jury declared him insane and he was committed to a Californian psychiatric hospital. In 2012, a Santa Barbara judge allowed Attias to be released to a less restrictive outpatient program after finding that he was not ‘clearly not the same vacant, troubled and confused’ man, reports the L.A. Times. On Friday night Rodger stabbed his two roommates and another man, before driving through Isla Vista firing at deputies and pedestrians, while deliberately driving into others. The coastal town of Isla Vista has now experienced two senseless murder sprees 13 years apart . In this 2001 photo, students and mourners gather on the Univeristy of California Santa Barbara campus to remember the four people killed after David Attias ran them down . Rodger died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head . after crashing his car, but he left behind a rambling 141-page . manifesto in which he wrote about his vendetta against female kind. With everything that has been learned about Rodger since Friday night’s . killing spree, there are many similarities between him and Attias. Both had fathers in the entertainment business. Rodger’s father, Peter Rodger, was an assistant director on the 2012 film The Hunger Games, while Attias’ father, Daniel Attias, is a television director who has worked on well-known shows such as The Sopranos and True Blood. Both had difficulties making friends and were frustrated about their sex lives. 'If only one pretty girl had shown some form of attraction to me, the Day of Retribution would never happen,' Rodger wrote in his manifesto. People pay their respects at a make-shift memorial set up outside the Alpha Phi sorority where two women were shot dead by 22-year old Elliot Rodger on Friday evening . 'I’d never even consider it. The Day of Retribution is mainly my war against women for rejecting me and depriving me of sex and love.' Both thought they were superior people and believed they were saving humanity with their deeds. While Attias’ called himself an 'angel of death,' Rodger’s described himself as a God. 'I will purify the world of everything that is wrong with it,' he wrote. 'On the Day of Retribution, I will truly be a powerful god, punishing everyone I deem to be impure and depraved.' In both instances, their parents had tried to seek help for their troubled sons. David . Attias' father testified that he tried to persuade his son to take his . medication, which he stopped doing when he began attending UC Santa . Barbara. A makeshift memorial to George Chen, one of Rodger's murdered roommates, is seen outside the apartment where they lived in the Isla Vista neighborhood of Santa Barbara . He reportedly suffered from mental illness and had been taking . numerous medications to control his impulsive behavior. Rodger's . parents had warned authorities about their son's behavior in April, . prompting deputies to go to his home to check on his welfare. After reading his chilling manifesto on Friday night, they had frantically tried to stop their son from carrying out his plan but heard of the massacre on the radio as they traveled to his apartment. The 22-year-old had emailed the 140-page document to a couple of dozen people including his parents and at least one of his therapists just hours before he went on his shooting rampage. Two students look at a sign that reads 'We are Gauchos We are Strong We will Remember' set up outside an apartment in the college town of Isla Vista after Friday's tragedy . Lichin Rodger, the suspect's mother, . reportedly received the email at 9.17pm and immediately went on to her . son's YouTube page where she found the newly uploaded video titled . 'Retribution' which describes his plan of 'slaughtering' women at a . sorority house at the University of California at Santa Barbara. Mrs Rodger then alerted her estranged husband, Peter, and after he watched the video she called 911. The former couple then set off from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara to try find their son. But they were too late and heard about the shooting en route.","Elliot Rodger's senseless killing spree has a number of parallels with another tragic incident which occurred in Isla Vista in 2001 .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A 46-year-old woman has reportedly become the oldest mother to give birth through IVF using her own fresh eggs. Belinda Slaughter delivered her first child - a healthy boy called Jackson - despite doctors giving her only a one per cent chance of conceiving. Speaking of her relief and joy, the dental hygienist, from Orlando, Florida, in the United States, said: 'I was willing to take the chance of it not working, but believe in God that it would.' 'I believed in God that it would work': Belinda Slaughter (left) is . thought to have made medical history after giving birth to baby Jackson (right) at the age of 46 using her . own fresh eggs . She is thought to have made medical history because although mothers older than her have given birth through IVF, they have been with donor eggs or frozen embryos. Mrs Slaughter's, however, were her own and fresh. Dr Richard Paulson, a medical director of the fertility program at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine, told the Orlando Sentinel: 'What's remarkable about this case is not the age of the mother so much as the age of the egg, which was 46 years old.' Mrs Slaughter, whose case was published in Fertility and Sterility, a journal of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said she had no idea of the record. Baby joy: Mrs Slaughter (pictured with Jackson and husband Torrance) is thought to have made medical history because although mothers older than her have given birth via IVF, they have been with donor or frozen eggs . A woman is born with a set number of eggs to last her lifetime. This is thought to be around one million, but reduces to some 400,00 by the time they start puberty - and only a fraction of these will fully mature. But the quality of the eggs also declines with age which makes it far harder to conceive later in life. Around 7million American women are believed to suffer from infertility, with poor-quality eggs a factor in around 70,000 of those. 'I didn't think this was so special,' said Mrs Slaughter, now 47. 'I thought ""there are women older than I am having babies"".' Rajo Devi Lohan, from India, is currently the world's oldest mother after giving birth to a daughter at the age of 69 in 2008 through IVF not using her own fresh eggs. According to Guinness World Records, the oldest person to have a baby naturally, without infertility treatment, was a 59-year-old British woman who gave birth in 1997. Mrs Slaughter turned to IVF after having an operation to remove 18 fibroids - non-cancerous tumours - from her uterus. Dr . Mark Trolice, founder and medical director of Vivere-Winter Park . Fertility Laboratory, harvested the eggs from her ovary in March last . year. He then fertilised them with her husband . Torrance's sperm and transferred the embryos into her ovaries, one of . which successfully implanted. Actress Halle Berry (left) spoke of her surprise when she discovered she was pregnant with her son Maceo at the age of 47, while fellow actress Laura Linney (right) gave birth earlier this year at the age of 49 . Mrs Slaughter gave birth in September but not before needing a caesarean section nine weeks early after her cervix weakened. She said: 'I always knew it was going to work.' Although Mrs Slaughter required IVF, it is not uncommon for women her age or older to give birth naturally. Actress Halle Berry recently admitted she was dumbfounded when she found out . she was expecting son Maceo at 47 because she had been feeling . 'premenopausal' and didn't think she could conceive. Meanwhile, Oscar-nominated actress Laura Linney gave birth to her first child, a baby boy, in January at the age of 49.","Florida woman Belinda Slaughter gave birth to healthy boy called Jackson .

"By . Ashley Collman . A former accountant has been convicted of threatening to kill an IRS agent and rape and kill the agent's wife over a $330,000 tax bill. Andrew A Calcione of Cranston Rhode Island was found guilty on charges of threatening to assault and murder an IRS agent and his family in federal court on Friday, and now faces up to 20 years in prison. The 49-year-old was arrested for leaving two disturbing voicemails on his IRS agent's work phone, after receiving the news that he owed thousands in taxes. Going to jail: Andrew Calcione (left) faces up to 20 years in prison after threatening an IRS agent over a $330,000 tax bill. Pictured above with current wife Courtney . Accountant: According to public documents, Calcione worked in a tax-prep firm for several years but is no longer registered as a CPA. A picture of his firm above . Calcione's statements are made even more bizarre by the fact that he worked as a tax preparer for several years. Tax bill: An IRS agent was investigating Calcione at the time of the threatening calls, and estimated that the 49-year-old owed an additional $330,000 for 2008, 2009, and 2010 filings. Pictured above golfing in a photo posted on Facebook . Calcione's IRS agent was investigating his tax forms from 2008 to 2010 and estimated that he owed an additional $330,000. In April 2013, Calcione and his ex-wife Patricia were asked to sign a form allowing extra time to assess their case. Calcione signed the document, but his wife did not, spurring the agent to leave a voicemail on Calcione's cell phone asking about the form the following July. Three days later, an infuriated Calcione left a threatening voicemail on his agent's work phone and a transcript of part of the message was revealed in court papers. 'The next time you think you want to f****** call me up … don’t. ‘Cause the next time you do, I’m not going to answer. I’m just going to show up where you live,' Calcione says. He goes on to threaten the agent's life and that of his family. 'Matter of fact, I’d shoot you in the f****** knee caps, tie you to a f****** chair, gag ya … and then f*** your wife in front of ya, and then blow her f****** brains out in front of ya and maybe kill your f****** kid...' 'So you can deal with that. Do not f****** call me again. I don’t bother you. Don’t f****** bother me.' The second voicemail was Calcione telling the agent to ignore the prior message. 'Disregard my previous voicemail. I was f****** around with my daughter,' the message said, according to the agent. After receiving the threatening calls, the agent reported Calcione to the police. In the course of their investigation, Calcione changed his story three times and first said the message was intended for his ex-wife. He then told authorities he meant to call his daughter, and changed his story a final time to say he was talking to himself in the car and must have accidentally rung the agent with his hands-free calling system. Threats: Calcione threatening to kill the IRS agent, rape the agent's wife and murder the agent's child in one of the voicemails. Pictured above on a trip to Jamaica, posted on Facebook . According to public records, Calcione was a partner or president of a tax-prep firm for several years, though he is no longer registered as an accountant on CPAverify. Calcione could face up to 20 years in prison when he is sentenced on September 11. U.S. Attorney Peter F Neronha says his office is seeking 'the toughest, appropriate sentence in this case.' 'The vast majority of Americans understand the payment of their federal taxes is part of their civic responsibilities.  A very small number do not, and an even smaller number not only refuse to pay their taxes, but engage in the kind of outrageous, threatening, and frankly bizarre behavior involved here,' Neronha added.","An IRS agent was investigating Andrew Calcione's taxes for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimated the Rhode Island man owed an addition $330,000 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Vietnam has accused a Chinese vessel of ramming and sinking a Vietnamese fishing boat near a controversial oil rig in the South China Sea. Tensions are already dangerously high after China moved an oil rig near an island chain in the South China Sea at the centre of a territorial dispute between the two neighbours. Today Hanoi accused a Chinese vessel of ramming the wooden Vietnamese boat and then fleeing the scene. This file picture taken on May 14, 2014 from a Vietnamese coast guard ship shows a Chinese coast guard vessel (L) sailing near a Chinese oil rig in disputed waters in the South China Sea . Beijing said the Vietnamese boat was trying to get close to the oil rig, rammed into one of its vessels, and then sank. The crew was rescued. The clash occurred around 18 miles south-southwest of the large oil rig that China deployed on May 1 in waters both nations claim. The rig deployment infuriated Hanoi and set off violent anti-China protests that further soured ties between the neighboring communist countries with close economic relations. A Vietnamese Coast Guard officer taking a picture of a China Coast Guard ship moving toward the Vietnamese ship near to the site of a Chinese drilling oil rig (file photo . Vietnam sent patrol ships to confront the rig, and China has deployed scores of vessels to protect it. The two sides have been involved in a tense standoff, occasionally colliding with each other. China and Vietnam have long sparred over who owns what in the oil- and gas-rich waters. Incidents between fishing crews are quite common, but Monday's incident was the first time a Vietnamese boat had been sunk, said Tran Van Linh, president of the Fisheries Association in the central port city of Danang. 'I call this an act of attempted murder because the Chinese sank a Vietnamese fishing boat and then ran away,' Linh said. 'We vehemently protest this perverse, brutal and inhumane action by Chinese side.' Linh said about 40 Chinese steel vessels surrounded a group of smaller, wooden Vietnamese fishing ships on Monday afternoon. He said one then rammed into the Vietnamese ship, tossing 10 fishermen into the water and sinking the boat. The fishermen were picked by the other Vietnamese boats and there were no injuries. In Beijing, the government said that a Vietnamese fishing boat had forced its way into the area around the oil rig and rammed into a Chinese fishing boat. Dispute: A Chinese ship, left, shoots water cannon at a Vietnamese vessel, right, while a Chinese Coast Guard ship, center, sails alongside in the South China Sea, off Vietnam's coast (file photo) 'I think the fact that this incident happened at all shows that Vietnam's illegitimate and illegal harassment and sabotage against China's regular operations are futile and will only hurt their own interests,' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang. Since May 1, Vietnam has accused China of ramming into or firing water cannons at Vietnamese vessels trying to get close to the rig, damaging several boats and injuring fisheries surveillance officers. They have shown video footage of some of the incidents. China accuses Vietnam of doing the same. China claims nearly all of the South China Sea as its own, bringing it into conflict with far smaller neighbors like Vietnam and the Philippines. In recent years it has been more assertive in pressing its claims in the waters and resisting attempts to negotiate. Protesters stand on the corner of a street in Quan Doan 4, Binh Duong province, near Song Than 2 Industrial Park in Vietnam followning China's planting of an oil platform in contested waters off Vietnam in May . Philippine President Benigno Aquino III said Tuesday his country was watching developments in the Vietnam-China standoff. 'We're trying to learn the right lessons and our armed forces and coast guard and other concerned agencies are looking at the possible scenarios and what should be our appropriate response,' he said. He spoke from a western Philippine naval base he said had been equipped with surveillance and better communications to better guard against territorial intrusions. The United States, which shares the concerns of the smaller claimant states about China's rising military might, called China's deployment of the rig 'provocative.' Vietnam is trying to rally regional and international support against Beijing, but its options are limited because China is the country's largest trading partner.

The 35-year-old defender is available on a free transfer after ending his 12-year association at Old Trafford and has attracted interest from a number of clubs around the world. Sportsmail revealed that United chief Ed Woodward informed Ferdinand that he would not be offered a new contract in the away dressing-room at Southampton on the final day of the season, but the player had already moved his wife Rebecca and three children back down to London from their Cheshire home in anticipation of leaving the club.

No transfer fee: Ferdinand is available on a free after ending his 12-year association at Old Trafford . Ferdinand will weigh up his options over the next few weeks but it is understood that Tottenham have registered an interest and he has already held talks with Harry Redknapp, the man who gave him a senior debut at West Ham in 1996, over a move to newly-promoted QPR. A return to West Ham is another possibility for one of the most gifted centre-backs of his generation, with Sam Allardyce under pressure to play a more attractive football at Upton Park next season, and Crystal Palace may also offer him the chance to finish his career in the Premier League. Ferdinand’s return to London does not necessarily rule out a short-term move abroad and there is interest from Turkey, China, the Middle East and America’s Major League Soccer, but it is understood that the former Leeds defender would prefer to stay in England.

"By . Chris Pleasance . A dog-walker accidentally killed six pets after locking them in the back of a hot truck for 45 minutes then lied and said the animals had been stolen. Emma Paulsen sparked a week-long hunt for the dogs - Buddy, Teemo, Oscar, Mia, Molly and Salty - after saying they had been taken from her truck when she left for ten minutes to use a bathroom. But last week Paulsen confessed to pet investigators that the animals, including her own dog, died after she locked them in her pickup for 45 minutes. Emma Paulsen, a dog walker, has admitted killing six animals, inlcuing Molly (pictured) a German shepherd-blue heeler cross, after locking them in the back of her truck for 45 minutes on a hot day . Paulsen dumped the dogs' bodies in a ditch then lied to owners, telling them their pets had been stolen, sparking a week-long hunt (pictured, pit bull Mia, left, and Poodle-Bouvier mix Teemo, right) She now faces a fine of $75,000 (£44,500) or up to two years in prison. The SPCA, which is leading the . investigation, will recommend that authorities pursue animal cruelty . charges, said Marcie Moriarty, the organisation’s chief prevention and . enforcement officer. Paulsen reported the dogs missing on May 13 after taking them for a walk in a park in Brookswood, British Colombia. Speaking to the Globe and Mail Alesha MacLellan, co-owner of Petsearchers Canada, said: 'From the get-go, the story didn’t make a whole lot of sense. 'The washrooms were in sight of where the truck was parked. I’m trying to grasp how someone could so quickly retrieve six dogs that they do not know and get them into another vehicle without anyone seeing. It seemed far-fetched.' In fact, the . animals had died of heat exhaustion. In an attempt to cover up her crime, . Paulsen dumped the bodies in a nearby ditch and claimed the animals had . been stolen. Petsearch Canada added: 'Emma disclosed that all six dogs were in the back of . her vehicle with the side vent windows open and water available, as she . had done hundreds of times. 'All six dogs . perished from heatstroke. Upon arriving and Emma seeing . her beloved charges deceased, she went into a blind panic at the . thought of notifying the families and the possible repercussions. 'In a . complete state of shock and panic, Emma made a desperate attempt to . cover up what had happened and concocted a story to explain the loss of . the dogs.' Paulsen told pet detectives the truth, and now faces up to two years in jail after the British Columbia Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals recommended pressing charges (pictured, Rottweiler-husky mix Oscar) Writing on a Facebook page dedicated to the dogs, Jenn Ortner, who owned Boston terrier Buddy (pictured) said she was 'devastated and heartbroken' adding 'the tears just won't stop' The Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed the dogs’ deaths last week and said that they were still investigating, adding that no charges had yet been filed. Prosecutors will have the final say on whether to charge the dog walker, Moriarty added. Writing on a Facebook page, Jenn Myers Ortner, who owned black and white Boston terrier Buddy, said: 'These dogs were our worlds and now we are all devastated and heartbroken. 'I am not sure if we will ever truly mend from this. The tears just won't stop.'","Emma Paulsen was looking after six dogs including her own pet, Salty .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A Thai truck driver who knocked down and killed a British couple who were on a round-the-world cycling trip was fined just £18. Peter Root and Mary Thompson, both 34, left Guernsey in July 2011 and had cycled through Europe, the Middle East and China before reaching Thailand, their 23rd country. But the couple were killed when they were run over by the driver of a pick-up truck while riding their bicycles on a road 70 miles east of Bangkok in Phanom Sarakham, Chachoengsao in February last year. The couple were travelling on the hard shoulder when a pick-up truck veered from its lane and struck them . The truck driver Vorawong Sangkawat lost control when he bent down to pick up a hat off the floor of his Toyota truck, according to Thai police. The lapse in concentration sent his vehicle swerving into the hard shoulder, where it knocked down and killed the couple. The 25-year-old was arrested and charged with killing them both through negligence. However, he was given a suspended two-year prison sentence and fined 1,000 Baht, the equivalent of just £18. A post-mortem examination in Guernsey confirmed that the couple had both suffered severe head injuries consistent with a road traffic accident. The examination was delayed because of difficulties in obtaining details of the driver's prosecution. Eventually officials discovered that when Sangkawat appeared in Chacheungsao Provisional Court last year, he pleaded guilty to an offence of causing death by negligence. The single offence violated several laws and carried a potential sentence of up to 10 years in jail. But he left court with a two-year suspended sentence because of his guilty plea, remorse and previous good character. Peter Root, left, and Mary Thompson, right had set off on their round-the-world cycling trip in July 2011 from Guernsey and had reached their 23rd country, Thailand when the accident happened . A map showing where the couple where hit by the pick-up truck while cycling in Thailand . He was also placed under probation service supervision for one year and made to attend a seminar relating to the country's Land Traffic Law. Mr Root, was an acclaimed artist and lecturer born in Jersey but grew up on the Channel Island of Guernsey. He met Bristol-born Ms Thompson when they both attended art college in Falmouth, Cornwall, 14 months earlier. In the wake of their deaths, Peter's father Jerry described them as a 'golden couple' who 'loved life'. Both of them were highly acclaimed artists who had put on exhibitions all over the UK and as far afield as Istanbul and Bolivia. Mr Root had work displayed in the Saatchi gallery, while Ms Thompson exhibited at the prestigious Waterman's Gallery in London. She was also a highly regarded jewellery designer, while Mr Root taught digital media and design at the Guernsey College of Further Education. An inquest in Guernsey heard they had cycled through the whole of Europe and a number of dangerous places including Iran and Afghanistan. The couple were keeping a blog called, 'Two on Four Wheels', describing their experiences on their round the world trip . Their online blog, 'Two on Four Wheels' described how they faced extreme weather conditions and even came under gunfire during the 19-month trip of a lifetime. Judge Philip Robey recorded a verdict of accidental death, saying the medical evidence was consistent with severe head injuries caused by a traffic collision. In the wake of their deaths, family members set up the Peter Root and Mary Thompson Charitable Trust for the future promotion of the arts and other charitable interests. Mary's brother Ben, from Bristol, said at the time of their deaths: 'Mary was a ray of sunshine - a hugely positive, gentle person who just loved people and making friends. 'Equally, Pete's dry wit, irreverent sense of humour, generosity and boundless enthusiasm won him friends everywhere he went. 'Many people just talk about their dreams - Mary and Pete actually went out there and lived them. 'The world is undoubtedly a much poorer place for their passing, and they leave behind two heartbroken families and countless friends.' Thailand is well known for its perilous roads, with more than 13,000 killed and almost 1million injured each year in accidents.","Peter Root and Mary Thompson were knocked down by a truck in Thailand .

Carr, who served 21 months in jail for providing killer Ian Huntley with a false alibi after he murdered Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, both ten, in 2002, was given away at the ceremony by her 71-year-old mother. Her husband is said to be ‘absolutely besotted’ with the former teaching assistant despite being aware of her past. It is understood his family were surprised by his decision to marry the former prisoner but offered their support by still attending the wedding. The newlyweds are said to have smiled and joked with guests as they posed for photographs on the hotel's patio after exchanging vows in front of a registrar. But news of the recent wedding has angered some individuals who believe it is unjust Carr is continuing her life as normal. One source told The Sun: ‘The families of Holly and Jessica will never get to see their daughters marry. ‘They will never get to enjoy their big day. Why should she?’ Carr was originally jailed for three-and-a-half years for perverting the course of justice by covering for Huntley but only served half of her sentence. She was given anonymity for life on her release in 2004. It means details of her wedding, new partner or the venue they married at cannot be published because it could lead to her identification. She is just one of four former UK prisoners to be given secret identities, along with child killer Mary Bell and James Bulger’s murderers Robert Thompson and Jon Venables. Police protection and a new identity for Carr are thought to have cost the taxpayer millions. Scroll down for video . Schoolgirls Holly Wells (left) and best friend, Jessica Chapman (right), both ten, went missing in August 2002 . Huntley, now 40, was found guilty of murdering the girls following a six-week trial at the Old Bailey, and is now serving a double life sentence in prison . Carr was the girlfriend of school caretaker Huntley when he was arrested soon after the bodies of schoolgirls Holly and Jessica were found in August 2002. They had been missing from their homes in Soham, Cambridgeshire, for 13 days. Huntley eventually admitted that the girls had died in his house after he had invited them in, but said their deaths were accidental. He had told them that Carr was in the house, but she had actually gone to Grimsby to visit relatives. Although Carr was not implicated in the murder, she gave Huntley a false alibi, claiming that she had been with him at the time of the killings, which delayed the police investigation. In fact she was at a nightclub in Grimsby with another man. Huntley, now 40, was found guilty of murdering the girls following a seven-week trial at the Old Bailey, and is now serving a double life sentence in prison.

"By . Lillian Radulova . Beth Whaanga received an enormous amount of international support after she bore her cancer surgery scars in a nude photo shoot in February . Beth Whaanga made international headlines in February this year when she posed nude for a moving photoshoot to show off her multiple cancer scars. Now, the brave 33-year-old has begun work on her Under The Red Dress Project alongside photographer Nadia Masot, which will see other women bare their scars in the same fashion. Her campaign will involve an exhibition and a coffee table book that feature confronting photographs of women who have survived cancer. Hundreds of women have so far sent letters of support to Ms Whaanga, who is from Brisbane, as well as applications to participate and be photographed for the project. Mrs Whaanga and Ms Masot have so far hand-picked a range of women from across the world to feature in the project, which will also tell each person's personal story. The collaborating duo are also currently in the process of sourcing funds to help kick-start their project, which aims to build awareness of cancer and the stigma surrounding the scars patients receive from treatments and surgery. In a video the team submitted to Kickstarter, a fund sourcing website, Mrs Whaanga revealed the inspiration behind her new idea. 'What we want to achieve with the project is overall respect for other people. We also want to achieve positive body image for men and women who have been through cancer and make people more accepting about what's going on in other people’s lives,' Mrs Whaanga said. 'Those people who are fighting the fight, they need to be represented in a way that's true and honest so that people understand what they're going through is really, really hard.' Earlier in the year, Mrs Whaanga told The Courier-Mail  that while the images were confronting, the project's message was the focus. The Brisbane mother and her photographer, Nadia Masot, have now begun collecting pictures and stories of other women who bare cancer scars for an exhibition and coffee table book . 'We're concerned about getting out the message of being vigilant and responsible for our own bodies through confronting imagery,' she said. 'It was always going to be a bit controversial and we're completely OK with people not being comfortable with that.' Ms Masot said the project's success exceeded its expected reach. 'We just decided to do a campaign - we never anticipated the reach so suddenly,' she said. 'Even in my own photography I was thirsty to work on something more meaningful - cancer is an experience with life changing results.' Tackling head on the ravages of her cancer surgery, Mrs Whaanga refused to hide her scarred body following a double mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery earlier this year, when she decided to share photos of her post-surgery body on Facebook. After posting the photos, the Brisbane mother received a huge backlash, with more than 100 people unfriending her. Last year on her 32nd birthday, Mrs Whaanga was diagnosed with breast cancer and doctors found she had the BRCA2 gene, which predisposes women to breast cancer. After her surgery in November, Mrs Whaanga teamed up with friend and photographer Ms Masot, to photograph her body and illustrate the devastation of surgery as part of the Under the Red Dress project. The duo have received over hundreds of emails from women internationally, willing to participate in their Under The Red Dress Project . The images were then posted Mrs Whaanga’s Facebook page, where she warned her friends about the confronting material. 'These images are confronting and contain topless material,' she posted. 'They are not in any way meant to be sexual. The aim of this project is to raise awareness for breast cancer. If you find these images offensive please hide them from your feed. 'Each day we walk past people. These individuals appear normal but under their clothing sometimes their bodies tell a different story. 'She added that self-examination was vital. 'It can happen to you,' she posted. One commentator Andrew Young said Facebook was not the platform for the photographs. 'I . personally do not agree with posting confronting pictures on a site . where people do not get a choice whether they wish to view it, as . happened to me when scrolling through my news feed,' he posted. This may . also occur to children scrolling through their feed.' Mrs Whaanga responded by saying everyone was entitled to their opinion, while Ms Masot defended the photos by reminding people that cancer did not discriminate. Mrs Whaanga has undergone a double mastectomy and full hysterectomy in November last year after being diagnosed with breast cancer . Confronting: Many of Mrs Whaanga's Facebook friends were offended by the images . Despite the images being reported to Facebook, the social network has promised that they will not be removed . 'For the people who think it’s 'just not for them' may just end up being the one who will wish one day they'd payed a bit more attention when it happens to them, only worse because they chose to be offended instead of listening,' Ms Masot posted. 'Ignorance is never a better option.' Mrs Whaanga told The Courier-Mail she was glad she posed for the photos. 'And after the surgery I feel that I will live longer, and that is the best thing for not just me but for my family,' she said, . 'I really wouldn’t want to . take away from people who are fighting that fight against breast cancer; . I was really fortunate given my family history and gene mutation that . my cancer wasn't as aggressive as others have suffered.' Despite the images being reported to Facebook, Mrs Whaanga has been advised they will not be removed. THE GENES THAT COULD LEAD TO CANCER . BRCA1 and BRCA2 are human genes that produce tumor suppressor proteins. The proteins help repair damaged DNA and ensure the stability of cells' genetic material . A woman’s lifetime risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer increases if she inherits a harmful mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 . About 12 per cent of women in the general population will develop breast cancer in their lives, while about 55 to 65 per cent of women who inherit a BRCA1 mutation and around 45 per cent who inherit a BRCA2 mutation will develop breast cancer by 70 . About 1.4 per cent of women in the general population will develop ovarian cancer in their lives, while about 39 per cent of women who inherit a harmful BRCA1 mutation and about 11 to 17 per cent who inherit a BRCA2 mutation will develop ovarian cancer by 70 . Tests that look for a known mutation in one of the genes and tests that check for all possible mutations in both genes are available . As BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations are relatively rare in the general population, those with a possible family history suggests are candidates for testing.","Beth Whaanga underwent a double mastectomy and breast reconstruction .

"By . Leon Watson . Artisan baker Paul Hollywood has shown his half-baked business sense after it was revealed his bread company has racked up debts . Great British Bake Off star Paul Hollywood's dough has been failing to rise, figures have revealed. The artisan baker and TV chef's bread company is in liquidation and has racked up debts of just under £60,000, according to the latest accounts. The figures filed at Companies House were for The Paul Hollywood Artisan Bread LLP, which he set up in Kent in June 2007. The Daily Telegraph reported today that £28,616 is owed to Hollywood himself. Hollywood, 47, announced he would be closing his speciality bread business last year after his television commitments left him unable to continue. 'It's a huge headache and massive problem because I wasn't there enough,' he said previously. Hollywood set up the firm after being inspired by the baking techniques he discovered on his travels to Cyprus, Egypt and Jordan. In 2008, Harrods started stocking the firm's Roquefort and almond sourdough which, at £15 per loaf, was the most expensive in the country at the time. The company has struggled in the past going £11,793 into the red for the year to June 30, 2012. It is not the first time Mr Hollywood has had to close down a company. In 2003, he liquidated his company Hollywood Bread. Liquidators were appointed in April 2003 and the company had debts of £262,000 when it was dissolved in December 2005. One of the companies his firm owed money to was Bradleys bakers, of Ashford in Kent, which had to write off £2,400. Managing director Graham Linkins said last July: 'In all the coverage I've seen about Paul Hollywood, I've never read that ten years ago he had a business that went bust. Hollywood presents the Great British Bake Off with Mary Berry (pictured). His creditors said they couldn't believe it when they saw the man who owed them money, on TV . 'About three years ago, I walked into my front room and saw him on the TV and said, ""That b*****d owes me money"".' Liverpool-born Hollywood's other firm, Paul Hollywood Limited, however is rising steadily. The latest accounts for the company show that it had a healthy £409,730 sitting on its books. MailOnline has made efforts to contact Mr Hollywood's agent.","The artisan baker and TV chef's bread company is in liquidation .

"By . Hugo Gye . A cyclist has filmed himself nearly running over dozens of pedestrians in a bid to shame them into improving their awareness of the road. He claims he posted the footage online for their own good, to help them realise the risks they take while walking around the roads of busy town centres. However, some observers have claimed that he put the pedestrians in danger himself by cycling too quickly and failing to take account of people as they crossed the street. Moreover, he refuses to reveal his own identity, using the pseudonym 'Careful Cyclist', even though many of the pedestrians in the video are clearly identifiable. Scroll down to watch the video . Danger: An anonymous cyclist has posted a video of pedestrians he believes are being reckless . Rush: Many of those in the film can be seen running to get out of the cyclist's way . Anger: The man says he posted the video to alert pedestrians to the danger they put themselves in . The anonymous man has previously posted videos of wrongdoing by motorists and his fellow cyclists. In his latest film, posted on YouTube two days ago, he rides around York capturing dozens of near-misses between his bike and pedestrians who do not seem to look where they are going. Some of the pedestrians are forced to jump out of the cyclist's way, while others ignore him entirely as they walk in the road. In two cases, mothers pushing buggies start to cross the road before the mysterious cyclist shouts at them to stop and they return to the pavement. Obstruction: The cyclist says he wants to draw attention to people acting recklessly on the roads . Controversy: Some say he fails to take account of the crowded streets and unpredictable behavior . The man filming apparently loses his temper on a number of occasions, shouting 'silly man' at one pedestrian and wagging his finger at people he believes are misbehaving. He said today that he has been cycling in York for 30 years, and has become increasingly concerned about pedestrians' behaviour. His aim is to make pedestrians ask themselves, 'Is the additional risk I am taking worth it?' In an online blog post, he wrote: 'The video highlights that again a number of road users are not taking the risks of the road seriously. 'Distracted by mobile phones, rushing to get somewhere, ignoring red lights at crossings, or simply not looking when crossing the road, pedestrians often rely on their hearing for warning of vehicles approaching.' Temper: On some occasions, the unidentified man ends up shouting at pedestrians to stop . Near-miss: The video shows how close the cyclist and pedestrians are to coming to blows . But some fellow cyclists suggested that he was increasing the pedestrians' risk by speeding towards them and refusing to slow down or go around them. 'You need to slow down a bit on approach, you call yourself a careful cyclist but I think you can improve,' wrote 'CycleGaz' on YouTube. 'Don't forget that the green light only means you can go if it is safe to do so - if someone is crossing, even if the man is red, you need to give way to them.' 'The Cycle Ops' added: 'Why don't you slow down for these people when you can see they're in the road? The onus is on you to avoid them.'","Cyclist pedals around the streets of York filming pedestrians in the road .

"By . Richard Spillett . One is famed around the country as one of Essex's most famous faces. The other is the party who took the county by storm in last week's local elections. But it emerged today that Joey Essex is completely oblivious to Ukip or the huge electoral landslide the party performed in the county from which he takes his name. The fact that one 21st century phenomenon has remained unknown to the other is perhaps not surprising after the former-Towie heartthrob also revealed he doesn't even know how to vote. Joey Essex may be the author of a new book, but he confessed he has no idea how to vote in an election . Ukip, led by Nigel Farage (left), made huge gains in Essex last week, but one of the county's most famous faces, Joey Essex (right) was completely oblivious to the result . The revelations emerged as Joey - dressed in a white hoodie and skinny black jeans, with fluorescent pink trainers and a black Chanel necklace - was greeted by a 500-strong crowd of screaming fans at a book signing at the White Rose shopping centre in Leeds. His autobiography, Being Reem, sold out of WHSmith in the shopping centre by 11am as excitable teenage fans queued from 7.30am for the TV star to sign their copy. Joey posed for pictures with scores of his elated fans, many of whom sobbed as they came face-to-face with the I'm a Celebrity star. Speaking ahead of the book signing, Joey refused to answer questions about his girlfriend Sam Faiers' comments about how she can't wait to be Mrs Essex - coyly muttering: 'You'll have to ask her about that.' Fans both male and female travelled from miles around to see their idol at a shopping centre in Leeds today . The appearance attracted hundreds of screaming fans, who arrived hours early to get to the front of the queue . But when asked how he voted in last week's local and European elections, he looked confused, and laughed: 'I didn't vote. I don't even know how to vote. I'll have to learn for the next one.' Ukip won more than 20 new seats in council elections in Essex last week, prompting party leader Nigel Farage to call himself an 'honorary Essex man'. But Joey confessed he had never heard of the party, adding: 'Who? I don't know anything about them.' But he was keen to talk about his new book, describing it was 'everything about me - my life, my job, growing up in Essex, behind the scenes of Towie'. Asked to explain his self-made vocabulary including 'reem', he said: 'There's a Joey Essex dictionary in the book so buy a copy and you can find it all out.' Charlotte Taylor arrived at 7:30am for the book signing and said: 'All my friends will be so jealous' Joey said his book included 'everything about me - my life, growing up in Essex and behind the scenes of Towie' He added: 'I didn't write the book myself. I got a ghost writer. I couldn't do it myself - my handwriting's awful.' Among the crowd was Joey Essex lookalike Eddy Macina, 16, of Leeds, who queued from 7.30am to meet his idol. He said: 'Yeah, I do look a bit like him. It's the eyes, and the eyebrows. It's cool - he's reem.' Nursery worker Charlotte Taylor, 19, of Leeds, was first up to meet the star - screaming as she said: 'I can't wait to meet him. 'I've been here since half 7, I want a picture with him and for him to sign my shirt. All my friends will be so jealous.'","Towie star appears for book signing of his autobiography 'Being Reem'

"By . Mark Duell . A man who lost his leg in a horror crash is being evicted from his rented home by his own father. Ashley Willoughby, 26, of Rochester, Kent, suffered a serious brain injury when he hit a lamppost and road sign while riding his motorcycle - and had to have his left leg amputated. After 14 operations he began the road to recovery with the help of a carer. But he has been unable to work and can no longer afford to pay his full rent to his father Graham, 48, who owns the flat. Facing eviction: Ashley Willoughby, 26, of Rochester, Kent, has been unable to work and can no longer afford to pay his full rent to his father, who owns the flat . He was presented with a formal eviction notice at an official meeting, reading: ‘It is with much regret that I have to serve you with two months’ notice by virtue of Section 21 of the Housing Act 1988.’ The letter, dated April 28, added: ‘The notice will end on June 29, 2014. Please return all keys, including outbuildings, on June 29, 2014. Yours sincerely, Graham Willoughby.’ Ashley Willoughby told MailOnline today: ‘It’s disgusting. Everything was going fine between myself and my father until I moved into the house I’m in, and then everything went pear-shaped. ‘I've been living in this house for three years. I've personally tried building bridges with him a few times - “do you fancy going out for a pint”, and he's busy every single weekend. Troubled relationship: Ashley Willoughby (left) admitted that his relationship with his father Graham (right) deteriorated before his accident last July, but insisted he had always paid his rent in full . In hospital: Ashley Willoughby suffered a serious brain injury when he hit a lamppost and road sign while riding his motorbike - and had to have his left leg amputated . ‘I'm not being defiant - I'm just . going to sit tight. This is my grandparents' house - it's my dad's . inheritance. It’s been in the family for over 40 years. My dad was . brought up in it.’ Property: The road on which the home (pictured) is located has an average house value of £179,000 . His rent . is £625 a month, although he only has to pay about two-thirds of this to . his bricklayer father each month. That is because his father receives . around £200 a month from the council. Ashley . Willoughby added: ‘I didn't know what the [official] meeting was about, but a . third of the way through the penny dropped. I said “you're evicting me”. He said he wasn't and I said “you are, there's no other way around it"".' The . son admitted that his relationship with his father deteriorated before . his accident last July, but insisted he had always paid his rent in . full. But he now faces the . prospect of becoming homeless - although his employers said they will . keep his job open until he is fit to return. He added: ‘You want to come back somewhere where you feel comfortable and safe. At the moment it's the opposite. I'm just sitting tight and waiting. I can't understand what he's up to.’ Ashley Willoughby, who has two brothers, is still waiting to find out how much benefit he is entitled to - and fears he will not get enough money to be able to afford a new place. He said he was determined to return to his old job as an electrician, despite his new disability. Ashley Willoughby said: ‘With my job you need to be active. You've got to be crawling around and up ladders reaching for things. I won't be able to do it like I did before, I'll have to make adaptations - but there's nothing holding me back. Nothing will stop me.’ The road on which the home - originally owned by his late grandparents Kathleen and Gordon - is located has an average house value of £179,000.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Super rich Arabs are spending £4.5million a day in Britain - cementing London's position as the world's top playground for the rich. Middle Eastern billionaires using the capital to spend their fortune have contributed to a boom in Arab cash pouring into the country. In total last year £1.25billion was spent in the UK by families from the Middle East - amounting to some £25,000 for every holiday. Scroll down for video . Visitors from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and the the rest of the Middle East were by far the biggest spenders on their trips to Britain . Americans as a whole spend more in the UK than Arabs - but only because they far outnumber Middle Eastern tourists. On day-to-day spending, Arabs are the biggest overseas shoppers in the world . Wealthy Arabs love to shop at exclusive London stores like Harrods . This £2million Bugatti Veron was flown over to London by rich Arabs to spend June in London shopping ahead of Ramadan . UAE visitors meanwhile lavished £156 a day, according to the Office for National Statistics. They are the biggest spenders of all foreign visitors to Britain. Only tourists under the title 'other middle east' spend more - at some £173 a day. Egyptians are the third biggest spenders, handing over £149 a day during their stay. Only American tourists as a whole contribute more than Arabs to Britain's tourist industry - spending a total of £1.5billion last year. But the number of visitors from the US far outstrips those from the Middle East - leaving the spending per person from the Arab world way ahead of that from the Americans. Arabs now spend twice as much as Australians, Germans and French - and 50 per cent more than Americans. Spending by overseas visitors last year soared by 12.7 per cent since 2012 to £21billion. More than half of this - some 53.6 per cent - was spent in London. Rich Arabs at Harrods head to London to spend their millions on designer gear from exclusive department stores like Harrods . For rich Arab women, London offers a wealth of shopping unmatched anywhere in the Middle Easy . The amount spent by overseas visitors in the capital itself almost doubled between 2003 and 2013. In total, overseas visitors spent more than £11billion in London last year - compared to under £6billion in 2003. The tourist spending figures were buried in the latest Office for National Statistics visitor statistics released this month. The figures showed the highest recorded number of overseas visits to the UK since 1961. In total there were 32,813,000 visits to the UK in 2013 - a 5.6 per cent increase since 2012. Over the same year, spending by overseas visitors increased by 12.7 per cent to £21billion overall. The number of visits to London in 2013 was the highest since 1961, with half of all visitors to the UK visiting London. Overall, there were 16.8million overseas visitors to the capital in 2013 - spending £11billion. Two-thirds of visitors from North America and other countries outside of Europe visited London during their visit to the UK last year. This is compared to just under half of European tourists visited London. Half of all foreign trips to London were for a holiday, instead of work. Over the last ten years, the number of overseas visitors visiting London for a holiday has increased from 4.9million in 2003 to 8.5million in 2013.

The study revealed the top five tricks women use to make sure they look their best in their selfies are: using soft mood lighting (51 per cent); shooting from a downward angle (47 per cent); adopting a slimming body pose (46 per cent); using smartphone filters (37 per cent) and ‘smizing’ - a term coined by Tyra Banks that means smiling with our eyes (29 per cent). The ladies of Cardiff favour using filters, 20 per cent of Southampton women love the pouty ‘duck face’, often adopted by Kim Kardashian, and 63 per cent of Newcastle women use flattering lighting in their snaps. A quarter of women confessed that they would never upload a photo of themselves online without resorting to at least one of these quick-fix tricks first. The selfie capital of the UK was revealed as Belfast, where over 84 per cent of respondents take at least one per week. Which pose do YOU adopt? Some of the tricks women use to retouch selfies include the pouty duck face, loved by Kim Kardashian, left, and smizing - a term coined by Tyra Banks that means smiling with our eyes, as shown by Miranda Kerr . This was closely followed by Birmingham (81 per cent) and Newcastle (76 per cent). In contrast, women from Cornwall are least likely to post selfies, with only 54 per cent doing so each week. With the rise of online dating apps, such as Tinder and LinkedUp, it seems that the pressure for women to aspire to perfection on social media platforms has never been higher. Almost two thirds (61 per cent) of the women questioned said that they felt the increasing popularity of dating sites and apps has also intensified the pressure to look good online. In fact, single men, take heed: 71 per cent of women admit they would be seriously put off if a prospective beau looked nothing like their dating profile picture on a first date. A spokesperson for The Body Shop said: 'It’s clear that the rise in popularity of selfies has really ramped up the pressure for us to make that all-important first impression online. 'However, The Body Shop has always been committed to activating self-esteem and we are passionate about giving women the tools to feel more confident in their skin.'

"By . Emma Glanfield . British cycling ace Mark Cavendish had to stop and ask two schoolboys for directions after he got lost on his bike while practising for the upcoming Tour de France. The Green Jersey winner, who has won 25 Tour stages, was given directions by the youngsters after he stopped in a bus shelter after getting lost in Middleham, North Yorkshire. Due to lack of GPS signal, he was struggling to find the right road to take in the area which forms part of the route for the first stage of this year's race, known as the Grand Depart. British cycling ace Mark Cavendish, who has won 25 Tour stages, was given directions by two schoolboys after he stopped in a bus shelter after getting lost in Middleham, North Yorkshire . The Omega Pharma-Quick Step rider, 29, spent two days riding through Yorkshire last week on a reconnaissance run for the Tour which starts on July 5. He is said to be desperate to win the first stage because it ends with a sprint finish in his mother's hometown of Harrogate. Gary Verity, chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, said the cycling sprinter was ‘impressed with the route’. He said: ‘He couldn't get a GPS signal in Leyburn, I told him that's an occupational hazard, but these schoolboys knew the route inside out and gave him directions. ‘Only then did they realise it was Mark Cavendish. He told them that he was going to win stage one. ‘He had a wonderful time, he was very impressed with the route and the enthusiasm of everyone he met. ‘It gives the whole team a huge boost to know someone like Mark is so enthusiastic and so determined. He said everyone in cycling is talking about the Tour and how special it will be.’ The Omega Pharma-Quick Step rider, 29, spent two days riding in through Yorkshire last week on a reconaissance run for the Tour which starts on July 5 . Cavendish appeared to enjoy his time spent in Yorkshire and even took to his Twitter profile to inform his 800,000 followers about his jaunt. On Friday, he posted a picture from his journey near to the Yorkshire Dales with the caption: 'Any guesses as to where I was taking this photo yesterday?' And on Saturday, he followed it up with a tweet which read: 'Couple of days done looking at the 1st 2 stages of @letouryorkshire @letour & I'm tired! Beautiful, but very hard start to a 3 week race.' He is now expected to continue training for this year's 21-stage Tour which will see some of the world's top cyclists battle it out for the coveted yellow, green, polka dot and white jerseys.","The cyclist, 29, had to ask for directions after getting lost in North Yorkshire .

"By . Mark Duell . A ruthless carjacker who stabbed a businessman to death for his prized black Mercedes SLK was today jailed, along with his getaway driver, for a total of 43 years. Rory Gordon, 23, of Bow, east London, knifed Harjinder Singh Bhurji, 32, when he refused to hand over the keys to the car. Mr Bhurji bled to death at the side of the road in front of his friend, Kajal Bhardwa, just moments after confessing he ‘liked’ her. Jailed: Rory Gordon (left) knifed Harjinder Singh Bhurji when he refused to hand over the keys to the car. He was convicted of murder while his getaway driver Jae-don Fearon (right), 21, of Chingford, was convicted of manslaughter. Gordon, a cannabis dealer with a previous conviction for robbery, stole the Mercedes to order after being promised just £1,000. He was convicted of murder while his getaway driver, Jae-don Fearon, 21, whose father was murdered in 2003, was convicted of manslaughter. Judge Michael Topolski sentenced Gordon to life imprisonment with a minimum of 30 years and Fearon to 13 years imprisonment. The judge said: ‘Harjit Bhurji, known as Raj, was passionate about cars. He studied and worked hard, . Harjinder Singh Bhurji, 32, was knifed to death . eventually securing a job at Mercedes Benz. 'He won many awards and made his family proud. His dream was to run his own business, a dream he realised. He was popular and much loved. ‘You Rory Gordon took his life. You murdered him for his car. The life that he had built up was extinguished in a few moments of greed and brutality. ‘You Jaedon Fearon played an important role in the events of that night. You know well the devastating effects of losing a loved one at the hands of a violent criminal.’ Andre Campbell, Gordon’s 23-year-old . cousin, was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment suspended for two years . for selling on Mr Bhurji’s stolen mobile. The Old Bailey heard Gordon and Fearon were specifically looking for a Mercedes SLK to steal while driving around east London. On September 13, 2011 they spotted Mr . Bhurji’s car with its personalised numberplate and followed him until he . parked up in Ilford. While . Fearon waited in the getaway vehicle, Gordon approached the Mercedes and . dragged Miss Bhardwa from the passenger seat before demanding the keys. Mr Bhurji hid the keys under his seat and claimed it was not his car. Miss . Bhardwa, a 25 year-old business analyst, described in court the . horrifying moment the masked man threatened to slit her throat if Mr . Bhurji, known as Raj, refused to cooperate. ‘He . turned to me and said “give me the key or I will slit her throat”’, she . said. ‘I genuinely thought he was going to do it. I thought I was going . to die. Prized vehicle: Gordon stole the black Mercedes SLK (pictured) to order after being promised just £1,000 . ‘I was saying give him the keys I see him suddenly lunge forward towards Raj and at that point I knew he had stabbed him. I knew it was somewhere in the chest area. I just remember Raj’s face when it happened. 'He had a very pained expression on his face when it happened and he made like a gasping noise and I just saw him hold his chest and I knew he had been stabbed. ‘I saw all this dark red on him. His face looked in agony even though he wasn’t screaming. All I see is his hand on his chest and his eyes, just fixed on me. It was an image I can always remember, to this day.’ Mr Bhurji managed to retrieve the keys from under his seat and hand them over before collapsing to the ground. The carjacker then drove off. Outside court: Andre Campbell , Gordon's 23-year-old cousin, was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment suspended for two years . Police recovered the Mercedes, which was fitted with a tracking device, at 2.50am parked three miles away in Chingford, east London. Mr Bhurji’s iPhone, which was in the vehicle when it was taken, was recovered days later after it was sold on by Campbell. Campbell sold Mr Bhurji’s stolen iPhone to the owner of a kebab shop for £100. The phone was later recovered by officers investigating the murder. Gordon admitted to the jury that Mr Bhurji ‘ended up getting stabbed’ but claimed he did not mean to kill him. ‘The guy came in my direction, I jumped back and jabbed with my right hand,’ he said. ‘I never intended to stab anyone. It happened so fast, as soon as he came towards me I pulled away.’ The court heard Fearon was ten years old when his father Jason was shot dead in a gangland shootout in Clerkenwell in Easter 2003. His speech at his father’s funeral received national coverage and in 2004 he was given the Woman’s Own Children of Courage award and met former prime minister Tony Blair and Prince Charles. Gordon denied murder but was convicted. Fearon, of Chingford, denied murder and was convicted of the lesser offence of manslaughter. Campbell, of Chingford, was found guilty of handling stolen goods.","Rory Gordon knifed Harjinder Bhurji when he refused to hand over keys .

"By . Associated Press . An express train smashed into into a parked freight train in northern India today, killing at least 40 people and reducing cars to heaps of torn and twisted metal. The Gorakhpur Express passenger train was travelling at high speed and slammed on its brakes in an attempt to stop, but hit the train sitting on the tracks near a railway station in Uttar Pradesh state, district magistrate Bharat Lal said. Six of the cars on the express train derailed, with one car with unreserved seating taking the brunt of the impact and accounting for most of the 40 deaths so far counted, senior police officer Amrendra Sainger said. Scroll down for video . Rescue workers attempt to make their way through the mangle Gorakhdham Express, which rammed into a goods train at Chureb station . At least 40 killed: Officials and rescuers gather around the wreckage after the Gorakhpur Express passenger train slammed into a parked freight train Chureb, near Basti, Uttar Pradesh state . 'It has been reduced to a mangled iron mesh,' he said. 'We do not know how many people were there.' While the car seats 72, such trains are often filled beyond capacity. Authorities were searching for the station master, who disappeared after the accident in Sant Kabir Nagar, about 140 miles southeast of the state capital, Lucknow. But authorities said it was too early to say what had gone wrong and were investigating everything from mechanical failure to human error. Villagers were the first to reach the scene after the accident about six miles from the nearest road. Indian TV broadcast images of them assisting the injured amid piles of strewn luggage. 'I was working in the field when I heard the whistle of the engine, and suddenly I heard the sound of a crash. It was a terrible sound . it still reverberates in my ears,' villager Ram Chander Chaudhry told news channel Samachar Plus. 'Within minutes I reached there and saw the train had been derailed.' Most of the victims were poor farm workers returning to their homes from the neighbouring state of Haryana, local police official Zameer Ahmad said. The train departed from Haryana's Hissar town and was just 29 miles from its destination of Gorakhpur when the accident happened. Most of the victims were poorfarm workers returning to their homes from the neighbouring state of Haryana . Six of the cars on the express train derailed, with one car with unreserved seating taking the brunt of the impact and accounting for most of the deaths . Because of the remote location, 'it was difficult to start rescue operations immediately,' Ahmad said. 'By the time police and rail officials reached the spot, villagers and other passengers had moved the injured away.' Rescuers worked to free people trapped under toppled cars and debris. The express train's driver died later Monday from serious injuries, while the assistant driver was in critical condition, railway official Alok Kumar said. Trains were diverted to other tracks to avoid the wreckage. Narendra Modi, who was sworn in later Monday as India's new prime minister, expressed condolences to the families of the dead in a message on Twitter. ""Prayers with the injured,"" he said. Accidents are common on India's railroad network, one of the world's largest with 20 million people riding daily on about 11,000 passenger trains. Most accidents are blamed on poor maintenance and human error. Earlier this month, a train crashed into a jeep at an unmanned railroad crossing in Uttar Pradesh, killing 13 members of a wedding party. Four days earlier, a passenger train derailed, killing at least 19 people just south of Mumbai. Another train derailment last month left dozens injured in the northeast state of Assam.","Gorakhpur Express was travelling at high speed and slammed on brakes .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A holiday company which offers ‘Barbie VIP packages’ to parents of girls as young as two has come under fire for gender stereotyping. The luxury five-star Forte Village Resort in Sardinia has been criticised for launching the ‘Barbie packages’ - which are aimed at girls aged between two and 13 - at a cost of £364 a week. According to the travel company’s website, the two packages – called Pink and Glamour – offer ‘unforgettable’ Barbie experiences including learning how to walk the runway, having spa treatments and being made-up with ‘glamorous make-up and hairstyling’. The luxury Forte Village Resort in Sardinia has been criticised for launching the 'Barbie packages' - which are aimed at girls aged between two and 13 - at a cost of £364 a week (file picture) Youngsters who partake in the week-long package will spend time in the specially-created pink Barbie house, while parents relax in the resort where a week-long holiday would cost a family of four more than £4,000. However, the ‘Barbie packages’, launched this summer, have come under fire from critics who have described them as ‘shocking’ and suggest they infer outdated gender stereotypes. Megan Perryman, co-founder of the group Let Toys Be Toys, which lobbies to stop gender-specific toys and books, said the packages ‘perpetuates this message that girls and boys should behave in certain ways instead of treating them like individuals’. She told The Guardian: ‘It's pretty shocking, particularly that it's aimed at girls as young as two.’ And writer Caroline Criado-Perez, who led a campaign to have more women represented on British banknotes, described the packages as ‘depressing’. A spokesman for Forte Village Resort (pictured) said the packages had so far been popular and provided a safe environment for girls to play . She told the newspaper that they sent a limited message to both girls and boys about how they should behave. ‘What I find so disheartening about this is that we push these things on little girls from such an early age – they must like pink, they are supposed to enjoy everyone looking at them, that they must prettify themselves – and then when they reach adulthood we vilify them for caring about how they look,’ she said. A spokesman for Forte Village said the packages had so far been popular and provided a safe environment for girls to play. There are two packages for guests to choose from - the Glamour package, which costs £445 per week, and the Pink package, which costs £364. The holiday company claims the most expensive package of the two allows youngsters to be ‘treated to the ultimate Barbie style bedroom’, a toiletry bag, exclusive gift and Barbie doll. It also lets mothers access the spa with their daughters where they will be offered treatments including manicures and a face mask treatment. Youngsters are also given the opportunity to partake in a five-day ‘Barbie fashion academy’ where they will create t-shirts, jewellery and photo frames before being glammed up and learning to walk the runway. In a separate package, the Royal Caribbean cruise company also offers offers girls aged four to 11 the Barbie Premium Experience, which is described as a 'Barbie dream cruise complete with fun, fashion and runway moments'. MailOnline has tried to contact Forte Village for further comment.","Forte Village Resort in Sardinia is offering packages to girls aged two to 13 .

"By . Mark Duell . Winston Churchill was hit by a series of personal tragedies during the First World War, new research revealed today. The future prime minister lost four close members of his family during the first few months of the 1914-1918 conflict, and a fifth near the end. Three more cousins were badly wounded during the war, in which he served as First Lord of the Admiralty before resigning after the Gallipoli campaign. Some of Mr Churchill’s closest friends were also killed in the Great War - including Valentine Fleming, the father of James Bond creator Ian Fleming. Several workers from his ancestral home, Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, also failed to return after joining the Queen’s Own Oxfordshire Hussars. Death: . Mr Churchill's maternal cousin, Captain Norman Leslie (pictured), was . the first family member killed on October 19, 1914 The Eton-educated . officer served in the 3rd Battalion Rifle Brigade and while on a . reconnaissance patrol at a railway embankment near Lille he was picked . off by a German sniper . Killed: Mr Churchill’s cousin, Captain Coulson Fellowes (left), died in October 1915 of the effects of exposure, ten months after being injured in the trenches. And Mr Churchill’s uncle Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Wilson (right) was shot in the head while leading his troops at Zillebeke near Ypres on November 6, 1914 . The true scale of the losses relating to him has been uncovered for an exhibition at Blenheim Palace, called ‘A Great Estate at War - Land, Sea and Air’. Blenheim’s education officer Karen Wiseman said: ‘When I started doing the research we did not know an awful lot about the extent of the heavy losses that befell Winston Churchill’s close family and friends during World War One. ‘But it became clear that he suffered greatly in the war. He was very close to his cousins as well as friends who worked in the estate. ‘He must have had such great resolve to go on and do the things he did.’ Family tree; The future Prime Minister lost four close members of his family during the first few months of the 1914-1918 conflict, and a fifth near the end . Mr Churchill’s maternal cousin, Captain Norman Leslie, was the first family member killed on October 19, 1914. The Eton-educated officer served in . the 3rd Battalion Rifle Brigade and while on a reconnaissance patrol at a . railway embankment near Lille he was picked off by a German sniper. The . next relation killed was Churchill’s uncle Gordon Wilson, a Lieutenant . Colonel in the Royal Horse Guards, who was shot in the head while . leading his troops at Zillebeke near Ypres on November 6, 1914. Badly wounded: Henry John Innes-Ker (left), the 8th Duke of Roxburghe, was shot in the groin area, while Oscar Guest (right), who served in the Royal Flying Corps, had a spectacular escape from death in December 1915. He fell unconscious at 2,000ft after being hit in the back, the ear and in the elbow by a bullets from a German plane . His ancestral home: Several workers from his ancestral home, Blenheim Palace also failed to return after being called up to the Queen's Own Oxfordshire Hussars . Another . cousin, Captain Coulson Fellowes, died in October 1915 of the effects . of exposure, ten months after being injured in the trenches. Winston Churchill became First Lord of the Admiralty in 1911 and held this position as the First World War began. He pushed the idea of attacking Gallipoli in 1915, which turned out to be one of Britain's most disastrous military campaigns. It had been intended to clear a relief route to Russia by securing a route from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. But fierce resistance from the under-rated Ottoman forces, inhospitable terrain and bungled planning spelt disaster. The campaign cost the lives of 36,000 Commonwealth servicemen - and Churchill became a scapegoat for it, later resigning. He then returned to the Army and was appointed Lieutenant Colonel, commanding the 6th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers. He led by example, often venturing into No Man’s Land on night patrol. During a visit to the frontline with his first cousin Charles Spencer-Churchill, the 9th Duke of Marlborough, he had his own lucky escape. A large piece of shrapnel fell between the two men. They were unharmed in the blast and each took a shell fragment to remind them of their lucky escape. Mr Churchill's stint in the trenches came to an end shortly after when, because of high casualties, his battalion was merged with another and he was told to return to Britain and resume his work in the Commons. Also . in October 1915, Lieutenant Wilfred Sheridan, the husband of Mr . Churchill’s cousin Clare Sheridan, was killed while leading his men at . the Battle of Loos. The fifth loss relating to Mr Churchill was Lady Alexandra Phyllis Hamilton, a second cousin of Churchill. On . October 11, 1918, she was on the Irish Steamer RMS Leinster when it was . hit by a German UB-128 submarine, when sailing out of Dublin Bay and . drowned. Three more of Mr Churchill’s cousins were badly wounded in the Great War. Henry . John Innes-Ker, the 8th Duke of Roxburghe, and his brother Captain Lord . Alistair Innes-Ker, were shot in the groin area and head respectively. The . third was the colourful Oscar Guest, who served in the Royal Flying . Corps, and had a spectacular escape from death in December 1915. Mr Guest’s never-before-seen war diaries make up part of the exhibition. The . so-called ‘flying cousin’ fell unconscious at 2,000ft after being hit . in the back, the ear and in the elbow by a bullets from a German Fokker . plane. He wrote: ‘After a while I felt like fainting so throttled down and went to sleep. ‘Bell-Irving (co-pilot) did the same and the machine wobbled down and crashed in a ploughed field cutting our heads a bit.’ The men came to and managed to find their way back to friendly lines. Mr Guest added: ‘Altogether a most wonderful escape.’ Aerial . warfare was a new concept in the First World War. Bi-planes were used . at first for reconnaissance purposes, until it was found they could also . drop bombs on the enemy. Mr Guest wrote of his dislike of bombing raids which he thought were dishonourable. Mrs . Wiseman said: ‘Reading the diary it is clear the airmen started off . being quite friendly towards the German pilots and they would wave at . each other. ‘When big guns . were fitted to the back and sides of the planes that’s when it started . getting bloody and the men began to harden. ‘By the end of the war all the men were ready to shoot to kill.’ Part of the exhibition at Blenheim focuses on the estate workers who served in the Queen's Own Oxford Hussars, who were sent to war by Mr Churchill. Mrs Wiseman said: ‘They were cavalry and the expectation that the army would break through and the war would be over within weeks. ‘But the hussars were used to plug the gaps along the frontline and were at all the major hotspots of the war like the Somme and Ypres. They saw a lot of action. ‘As well as losing members of his family, Churchill also lost some great friends who were in the hussars.’ The exhibition at Blenheim Palace, located in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, runs until July 1.","His maternal cousin Captain Norman Leslie was the first Churchill family member killed - near Lille in October 1914 .

"By . Daniel Martin . Iain Duncan Smith has been championing Universal Credit reforms for four years, but yesterday a quango was forced to invent a new rating to describe the project's failures . Iain Duncan Smith’s flagship welfare reform is going so badly that a watchdog has had to a create a whole new category to describe its failures. The Work and Pensions Secretary’s scheme to replace six separate benefits with a single Universal Credit was sent back to the drawing board last year following serious delays and cost overruns. The Major Projects Authority (MPA), the quango that assesses how effectively large schemes are being implemented, yesterday concluded that its worst rating was not bad enough to accommodate all the failings associated with Universal Credit. The fact that the Government published the damning study amid the announcement of local election results led to accusations that ministers were seeking to ‘bury’ bad news. The findings are a huge embarrassment for Mr Duncan Smith, who has championed the reform of welfare for the past four years. The authority’s assessment covered 199 government projects. Each was graded using a five-tier traffic-light system from green for the best-run schemes and red for the worst, via green/amber, amber and amber/red. However, Universal Credit has been given a category all of its own – ‘reset’, reflecting the fact that it has had to be started all over again. ‘We have undertaken significant work to develop a “reset plan” to place the rollout of Universal Credit on a more secure footing, and the “reset” delivery confidence assessment reflects this new status of the project,’ said the MPA. The Department for Work and Pensions said the judgment was out of date because it made its assessment of the project last September. A spokesman said there had since been progress in implementing the scheme through a limited number of pilots in Jobcentres. ‘Universal Credit is on track,’ she said. ‘The reset is not new but refers to the shift in the delivery plan and change in management back in early 2013. The project was  rated as 'reset' to highlighting the fact that the scheme had to be started over. The single benefit, which replaces a host of other handouts, is now being trialled in a limited number of Jobcentres . ‘The reality is that Universal Credit is already making work pay as we roll it out in a careful and controlled way. It’s already operating in ten areas and will start expanding to the rest of the North West in June.’ Other major schemes fared poorly in the review, with the delivery of two aircraft carriers rated ‘red’ for the second year in a row. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said the increased proportion of ratings from amber to red was a result of more projects overall being under way and new projects inevitably appearing higher risk in their early stages. ‘As part of this Government’s long-term economic plan we are improving the way our projects are run, helping save £1.2billion in 2012/13 alone,’ he said. John Manzoni, chief executive of the MPA, said his organisation was focusing on ensuring that the Government does projects ‘the right way’. ‘Critical to this is building leadership capability, clarifying project leaders’ accountability and responsibility for delivery,’ he said. In a further embarrassment for Mr Duncan Smith, the MPA gave his Work Programme, a scheme to create a single welfare-to-work programme for all the unemployed, an ‘amber’ rating. Spending watchdogs yesterday gave the  HS2 rail project an ‘amber-red’ warning,  meaning it runs a ‘serious risk’ of failing. Their official report warned the success of the £50billion scheme remains ‘in doubt’ with ‘major risks in a number of areas’ which require ‘urgent action’. The alarming verdict by the Major Projects Authority follows criticism that figures for the 300-mile high-speed line linking London to Birmingham and then the North simply do not add up. It follows an earlier amber-red assessment on HS2 in an internal report, which the Government refused to make public. This led the Information Commissioner to start a legal case, which is continuing, to force details to be revealed. The HS2 project it at 'serious risk' of failing with 'major risks in a number of areas' which require' urgent action' The latest rating is based on concerns about the sums underlying the project which critics insist simply do not add up. These includes worries about costs spinning out of control, the environmental impact, amount of compensation and how much the North will benefit economically. There are also concerns that the fragile cross-party political consensus, particularly between the Conservatives and Labour, could fracture. The amber-red grading is the second worst of five running from red for ‘unachievable’ to green for success being ‘highly likely’. The MPA annual report has been seized on by opponents of the rail project. Penny Gaines, chairman of Stop HS2 said: ‘The Department for Transport may claim it is a project in excellent shape but the evidence says otherwise.’ Richard Houghton, of HS2 Action Alliance, said the report was ‘no surprise’, adding: ‘This project is running out of control.’ A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘HS2 has made significant progress in the eight months since the evidence for this report was gathered. We are on track to have spades in the ground in 2017.’ The HS2 Bill survived its second reading despite a rebellion by dozens of Tory MPs. A rail project to decide the Essex Thameside franchise was also labelled amber-red.","IDS has been championing Universal Credit project for four years .

"By . Hugo Gye . A plumber was almost blinded in a freak accident after a garage door flew into his face and left him with a shattered cheekbone. Lee Collins was carrying out chores at his home in Burnley, Lancashire when he accidentally knocked the heavy metal door out of place. The bar which runs across the door smashed into his face, shattering his eye socket and fracturing his jaw. Injury: Lee Collins needed reconstructive surgery after being hit in the face by a garage door . Accident: The incident occurred earlier this month at the plumber's home in Burnley, pictured . But Mr Collins, a former rugby player, says the accident could have been much worse - if the square corner of the door had hit him, he could have lost the sight in his eye. The 42-year-old had to have two metal plates inserted into his face to avoid permanently damaging his facial structure. He endured two hours of reconstructive surgery at Royal Blackburn Hospital after the accident earlier this month. 'I had gone . into the garage and was bending down to pick something up when I must . have knocked the arm out of place,' Mr Collins said. 'I didn't even manage to pick up what I had bent down to get, when I was hit on the right side of my face with the metal bar. 'As soon as I did it happened I knew that it had caused some serious damage - I looked in the mirror about 30 seconds after and that side of my face had just completely swollen up. Agony: But Mr Collins, pictured left before and right after the accident, was lucky not to lose the sight in his right eye thanks to the injury . 'When my wife saw my face she went into a blind panic. Even though I'm annoyed that it happened, I do feel that I was actually lucky that it wasn't a lot worse than it was. 'I was hit with the middle part of the bar, but if it had been the square end of the bar which had hit me then I would have most likely lost my eye.' After going to A&E, Mr Collins underwent a scan on his face which revealed that the damage to his face was worse than initially thought. He added: 'After the accident I went to see an eye specialist and luckily my eye is OK and I didn't need any treatment. 'The scan I had showed that the injuries below the skin were a lot worse than what they thought from looking at my face, and there was a lot of trapped nerve and muscle damage. 'During the week pain was gradually getting worse. It was extremely painful. Now I have had the operation the pain has eased slightly but I'm still struggling to eat.'","Lee Collins, 42, was carrying out chores at home in Burnley when he accidentally released the door and it flew into his face .

"By . Jack Doyle . and Daniel Martin . David Cameron will travel to Brussels today to try to prevent an arch-federalist from becoming the new president of the European Commission. After millions voted for Eurosceptic parties in last week’s European Parliament elections, the Prime Minister warned that the EU cannot simply carry on with ‘business as usual’. He believes giving a top job to Jean-Claude Juncker – a former prime minister of Luxembourg who wants to increase the EU’s powers – would represent a slap in the face for voters. Action: David Cameron believes giving a top job to Jean-Claude Juncker - who wants to increase the EU's powers - would represent a slap in the face for voters. Above, Cameron and Juncker at an EU summit in 2010 . Across the continent, Eurosceptic parties doubled their representation in the European Parliament, and now hold a third of all seats. Mr Cameron does not have an alternative to Mr Juncker in mind, but hopes to postpone the race to replace the Portuguese Jose Manuel Barroso until someone more suitable can be found. Mr Juncker is standing for the centre-Right European People’s Party, which has emerged as the European Parliament’s largest single party. Mr Cameron ended the Tories’ affiliation with the EPP in 2009 over its federalist sympathies. The Prime Minister has now made a series of phone calls to the leaders of Germany, Lithuania, Hungary, Sweden, Slovenia and Ireland ahead of an informal EU summit today. Ex-prime minister: Mr Juncker is standing for the centre-Right European People's Party, which has emerged as the European Parliament's largest single party. Mr Cameron ended the Tories' affiliation with the EPP in 2009 . A Downing Street spokesman said voters would not tolerate more of the same from Europe in the wake of last week’s poll. ‘The PM has been making the point in these conversations that leaders should seize the opportunity of tomorrow’s dinner to heed the views expressed at the ballot box that the EU needs to change, and to show it cannot be business as usual,’ they said. ‘The turnout and results in the European Parliament elections have underlined the need for reform to ensure that the EU is doing more to deliver what voters care about: jobs, growth and a better future.’ The comments were backed by French president Francois Hollande, who said he would tell EU leaders that the union ‘must change to focus on jobs, growth and investment’.

Meanwhile, French president Francois Hollande (right) said he would tell EU leaders the union 'must change to focus on jobs, growth and investment' The current European Commission – which is responsible for proposing and implementing new EU laws – will remain in place until the end of the year. Downing Street sources said this means the process of appointing a new president could take months. One said: ‘The Prime Minister will talk to the other leaders about the need for them to think about the future direction of the EU and how it needs to change in order to respond to the turnout and to the results. They added: ‘The results underline the view of the British people and people across Europe that they want change. The EU needs to respond to this and reform.’","David Cameron aims to prevent Jean-Claude Juncker from getting top job .

"By . Sam Webb . A former Royal Marine cleared of setting fire to footballer Andy Carroll's Range Rover 'tried to have sex with a car', a court heard. Rob Curran was caught in a state of undress in broad daylight on a busy street, 'gyrating and thrusting' his groin against the bonnet of a black BMW. He was spotted by a horrified female witness as she drove down Station Road, in Backworth, North Tyneside. A court heard that, just an hour before, the 36-year-old had also been loud and abusive in a pub before smashing up the windscreen of the landlord's   car. Car lover: Rob Curran was caught in broad daylight on a busy street attempting to have sex with a black BMW . Curran was arrested and pleaded guilty to one count of exposure, one public order offence and criminal damage at North Tyneside Magistrates' Court,   where he claimed he couldn't remember anything because he was 'paralytic'. Rebecca Gibson, prosecuting, told the court the indecent exposure happened at 5.30pm on April 28. She said: 'The witness was driving through Station Road, which is a busy main road. She noticed a man and thought he looked like he was stretching against a car bonnet, as if he was about to go for a run. 'She looked again and noticed the car was a black BMW, which was parked up. The male was in front of the bonnet.' Curran was questioned when Andy Carroll's £70,000 chrome-plated 4x4 was set alight outside the home of then Newcastle manager Kevin Nolan. Five months later police told him he would not be charged . In a statement from the witness, she said: 'I then saw the male... he was gyrating and thrusting against the car bonnet. I thought, ""The dirty b******,   he's having sex with the car"". 'I couldn't believe a man would stand in public, fully thrusting against the bonnet of a vehicle.' The court heard the witness drove on and saw an unsuspecting mother and young child walking towards Curran. After returning home to get her mother and brother, she went back to Station Road but found the car gone and Curran, previously of Jesmond, Newcastle,   but now living at Holmlands, Whitley Bay, sitting fully clothed on a nearby wall. Drunk: Hours before the incident with the car, Curran had smashed the windscreen of a pub landlord's car . Curran was arrested and it was soon revealed that, just an hour earlier, he had entered the Black Horse Inn, in Monkseaton, North Tyneside, and become   loud and aggressive before throwing a charity box at the bar. Mrs Gibson said: 'He then picked-up a bar stool and went outside. The landlord, James Read, heard a large smash and saw the defendant by his car, a Citroen Berlingo, where he threw the bar stool to the ground and   walked away. 'Mr Read saw the windscreen of his vehicle had been smashed. The damage cost £216.' Mark Harrison, defending, said Curran was deeply remorseful for what he'd done. He said: 'The police didn't consider this sinister behaviour. They   described it more as drunk stupidity. 'I don't ever recall a more embarrassed, ashamed and remorseful individual. He hasn't stopped apologising. 'There had been a fractious breakdown of the friendship between Mr Curran and the publican. He accepted there had been a   disagreement and, in the spur of the moment, doing damage to the car. 'What happened later, was frankly unbelievable. He can't put an explanation to it because he can't remember it.' The court also heard Curran suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder from his time in the Marines. Magistrates adjourned sentencing for the preparation of reports. The former security specialist also spent five months behind bars in 2012 for crashing his car head-on into a taxi and brandishing knives in a village   pub. Curran served with the Royal Marines for eight years, before commanding a six-figure salary protecting the wealthy and influential all over the world. He was in a relationship with the mother of former Newcastle player Carroll’s child, Faye Johnstone and the striker’s ex-partner, Stacey Miller. Carroll, who now plays for West Ham, started seeing Ms Johnstone after she split from Curran. Then in July 2010 the footballer began dating Ms Miller, just weeks after she separated from Curran, reports the Evening Chronicle. Curran was arrested and questioned when striker’s £70,000 chrome-plated 4x4 was set alight outside the home of then Newcastle manager Kevin Nolan three months later. He was released on bail and five months later police told him he would not be charged.","Rob Curran, 36, was 'gyrating and thrusting' against a black BMW .

"By . Martin Robinson . A groom-to-be who smacked the bottom of an air hostess on his way home from his stag do could be jailed - just two months before his wedding. Peter Thompson, 48, was on a flight from Alicante, Spain to Bournemouth in Dorset when he drunkenly attacked the female Ryanair crew member. He told the 'pretty' hostess he 'loved her' before he mounted a friend's lap and slapped her bottom as she walked past, the court heard. The attendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pushed Thompson's hand away and told him not to do it again. In court: A stag could be jailed after he slapped the bottom of a Ryanair stewardess while drunk (file picture) Case: Thompson appeared at Bournemouth Magistrates Court (pictured) where he pleaded guilty to being drunk on the flight and to one charge of assault . Thompson appeared at Bournemouth Magistrates Court where he pleaded guilty to being drunk on the flight and to one charge of assault. Lee Turner, prosecuting, read a statement from the air stewardess and said Thompson told her she was very pretty and that he loved her. The statement said: 'He was looking at me as if I was a piece of meat.' She later noticed he moved from the seat and was sitting on the lap of his friend. Mr Turner said: 'As she walked past he smacked her bottom with his open right hand. 'She pushed his hand away and said ""Don't do that again"". 'He wasn't aggressive, she thinks he was trying to be funny but was actually very disrespectful.' The court heard that Thompson, who works at a language school and lives in Poole, had consumed alcohol and an antihistamine tablet before the flight on May 4. He was then sold a discounted alcoholic drink by the air stewardess on the plane. Incident: Peter Thompson, 48, was on a flight from Alicante, Spain to Bournemouth in Dorset when he drunkenly attacked the female Ryanair crew member . James Moore, defending, said that Thompson was in high spirits and looking forward to seeing his fiancee when the incident happened. He said he flailed his arms to express himself and accidentally made contact with the stewardess as she walked past. Mr Moore said: 'He's sat on the arm of a chair with a friend. He's barely aware that he's even touched her. 'Unfortunately, she got this wrong. 'What we have here is a man not intentionally making contact with the flight attendant. It wasn't nasty, it wasn't malicious, it didn't cause any trouble. 'This is not a sinister, nasty offence, it didn't put anyone at risk.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The president of the Oxford Union has written an open letter to prospective speakers to encourage them to honour their engagements despite his arrest on suspicion of rape. Ben Sullivan said: ‘This institution is bigger than its president,’ as he tried to prevent more damaging cancellations. Sullivan, 21, was arrested in his rooms at Christ Church, Oxford in the early morning of May 7. On Thursday Ben Sullivan must survive a vote of no-confidence against him . He was taken away for questioning, accused of raping a young woman and attempting to rape a second in separate attacks in the early part of last year. Police released him on bail while they continued their investigation and the Oxford Union itself sidelined him and elected an acting president, only for Sullivan to return. His decision to stay on led Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble to withdraw from an engagement this Friday. In his letter, Sullivan argued: ‘The Union was founded on the principles of free speech and debate. ‘This core belief in the opportunity for everyone to put forward their point of view still represents the ultimate purpose of the institution. ‘This overarching principle remains more important than any individual speaker, any debate, and any president.’ Ben Sullivan (pictured) at the Union during a debate: . He also offered to stand aside for the particular events if the speaker did not wish him to preside. Referring to the criminal allegations, Sullivan said that on legal advice he could not give his side of the story or defend himself against the allegations at the present time. ‘I therefore feel the calls for my resignation are premature, especially given that no charges have been brought against me,’ he said, adding: ‘Should the situation change I will of course review my position.’ The letter was a response to one by Sarah Pine, the Oxford University Student Union vice president for women, and fellow student Helena Dollimore, urging prospective speakers to consider withdrawing from the planned debates. Former American military commander General David Petreaus and singer Paloma Faith are among those due to attend the Union. On Thursday Sullivan, a history and politics student on sabbatical from his studies during his Union duties, must survive a vote of no-confidence against him. Sullivan was bailed to return to police on June 18. He has not been charged with any offence.

"By . Richard Spillett . Former bandmates of paedophile Ian Watkins say they have severed all ties with the shamed singer after he was jailed for child sex abuse. Two members of the band have spoken for the first time since Watkins, 36, was jailed for 35 years for a string of sex offences - including the attempted rape of a baby. Guitarists Lee Gaze and Mike Lewis told of their sense of betrayal after first believing the band's former frontman was innocent following his initial arrest. Scroll down to see video . Ian Watkins' former bandmates Lee Gaze (centre) and Mike Lewis (right) have spoken about the shamed singer (second from right), who has been jailed for child abuse . Guitar player Lee Gaze, 39, said he had initially feared for his one-time friend . when he was held in prison and maintained his innocence. Gaze described Watkins, who eventually admitted 13 offences, as a 'weak character', adding: 'He's a bit of a coward. 'To be in prison, where he's going to be the guy from the rock band with . those charges, I was worried. But then I reached a point where real . resentment set in.' Watkins, 36, was jailed for 29 years after admitting a string of child sex offences - including the attempted rape of a baby . He said he has no interest in ever speaking to Watkins again, saying he doesn't think the jailed singer would explain himself anyway. Watkins, whose group sold more than 3.5m records but have now split, . told his bandmates he was set up after rumours emerged that he had been found in possession of . indecent images of children, following his drugs arrest in a 2012. Father-of-two . Gaze, who was 17 when he met then-15-year-old Watkins, said the singer repeatedly told his bandmates he had been wrongly incriminated. In an interview with The Sunday Times Magazine's Krissi Murison, fellow guitarist Mike Lewis, who has known Watkins since the pair met aged five at infants school in Pontypridd, south Wales, said: 'I find it utterly unbelievable that he was capable of doing those things.' He said his shock was made all the worse by the fact that he been friends with Watkins, known his family and grown up alongside him. Lewis, 36, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife and four-year-old daughter, said he had severed all links with his former bandmate and once close friend. He said he had also considered whether he would want to speak to Watkins in prison but had decided he would not, even if he was given the chance. Lewis said he was away on holiday when Watkins was charged with a string of offences, including the abuse of children. The band split last October ahead of Watkins' trial but his former bandmates now plan to form a new group. Lewis said the band's 'legacy' had been 'wiped out' by Watkins' crimes and it is now impossible for the band to be proud of their achievements. Picture of Watkins on Skype. His crimes included getting a fan to abuse her baby as he watched on a webcam . Ian Watkins pictured in a 'Mega Lolz' T-shirt . Watkins was sentenced at Cardiff . Crown Court in December and told he would have to serve at least 35 years . before being considered for release. The court heard that after sexually touching a groupie's 11-month-old baby, Watkins tried to have penetrative sex with the child. He also encouraged a second fan to abuse her child during a webcam chat and secretly stashed child porn videos, some of which he had made himself. Sentencing judge Mr Justice Royce told Watkins: 'Those who have appeared in these courts over many years see a large number of horrific cases. This case, however, breaks new ground. 'I am satisfied that you are a deeply corrupting influence, you are highly manipulative, you are a sexual predator, you are dangerous.' After pleading guilty to the charges, Watkins, 36, sent a message to a fan joking about the offences. 'I am going to put a statement out just to say it was mega lolz,' he said. 'I don't know what everyone is getting so freaked out about.'","Singer Watkins was jailed for 35 years for 13 child sex offences last year .
