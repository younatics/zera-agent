"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The United States and Britain said Wednesday they are committed to remaining in Afghanistan, despite increased military casualties and declining public support for the war effort. U.S. Marines partrol part of the Gharmsir district in Afghanistan's Helmand province on Wednesday. ""We went into this together, and we will work it through together because we are stronger together,"" British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said after a half day of talks at the State Department with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Clinton praised Miliband's approach on Afghanistan, including the call for the government to reconcile with moderate elements of the Taliban. ""His analysis of the way forward is very much consistent with ours, and we will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder in pursuit of our common objectives,"" Clinton said of her counterpart. In a speech at NATO headquarters on Monday, Miliband called for rank-and-file Taliban to be given the chance to reconcile with the Afghan government, even as the campaign continues against Taliban commanders who are waging jihad. He also urged greater burden sharing not only among NATO allies in Afghanistan but by the Afghan government. ""There is a lot of talk, rightly, about burden sharing within the coalition, but the greatest burden sharing must be between the international community and the government of Afghanistan, which increasingly needs to take the lead -- the security lead, as well as the political lead -- in shaping the future of that country,"" he said. Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, told reporters that boosting the training of Afghan forces would be a big focus after the country's August 20 election. When asked whether the election would be fair, Holbrooke, who just returned from the region, said he had heard complaints from all sides but was not ""unduly upset."" ""It's an extraordinary thing to hold an election in the middle of a war, and this is the first contested election in Afghanistan in history,"" Holbrooke said, adding the United States has no favorite candidate but only wants ""an election whose outcome is accepted as legitimate by the Afghan people and the world, which reflects the desires of those who vote."" July has been the deadliest month for U.S. and British forces since the U.S.-led invasion in 2001, with 39 U.S. troops and 22 British troops killed. Miliband said the effort was going through a ""tough phase,"" but added that the British people understood the ""vital nature"" of the mission to stabilize Afghanistan. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has been under under enormous pressure from his opposition, which charges that British troops don't have proper resources to fight the war, including helicopters. But he was sanguine. ""I think the British people will stay with this mission, because there is a clear strategy and a clear determination on behalf of the United States and other coalition members to see this through,"" he said, adding that the British people understood the mission's ""vital nature."" Americans, too, have questioned whether the war in Afghanistan is winnable and worth the effort. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and members of Congress, including Democrats, have predicted that President Obama has a year to show progress in Afghanistan before public support for the war further erodes. Clinton said Britain and the United States ""have made significant gains in the recent operations"" against the Taliban, but ""there remains much work to be done."" ""We know that this is a challenge that is not going to be easily resolved in a short period of time,"" she said, adding ""both of our countries are still threatened by the same enemy, an enemy that has attacked London, New York and Washington."" ""We know they've attacked us in the past, and, unfortunately, we know that they plot against us even today,"" she said.","July deadliest month for U.S., British forces in Afghanistan since '01 invasion .

"(CNN) -- Scotland's Susan Boyle gives new meaning to the term ""overnight sensation."" The ""Britain's Got Talent"" contestant was expected to be something of a joke when she first sauntered on stage, but she absolutely wowed the audience, the judges -- and then the world via the Internet -- with her stunning rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream."" Along with Simon Cowell and Piers Morgan, Amanda Holden is a judge on ""Britain's Got Talent."" But like others who stumble upon sudden fame, she found the pressure and scrutiny to be overwhelming. ""Talent"" judge Amanda Holden and Dr. Drew Pinsky of VH1's ""Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew"" joined CNN's Larry King Tuesday night to discuss Boyle's hospitalization for stress and the toll the spotlight and media criticism might have taken on her mental health. They also discussed whether Boyle will develop the emotional stamina for a high-pressure singing career. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: What do we know right now? Amanda Holden: Basically, we've spoken to Susan's brother. He, in fact, spoke on [CBS' ""The Early Show""] this morning to say that his sister was very keen to come home as soon as she possibly could and that she was resting up in a clinic in London and that she was very much looking forward to coming out and seeing what was available to her when she felt better. King: Is the show, Amanda, paying for the hospital bills and are they taking care of her? Holden: I have no idea if they're paying the hospital bills. I would imagine that they are. We're a very loyal show. We love Susan very much. In fact, all the contestants that appear on our show are extraordinarily well looked after. King: Your fellow judge, Piers Morgan, has said that there was talk of taking her off the show because of all the pressures on her. Were you involved? Were there any discussions like that? Holden: I wasn't involved in any discussions like that. And I think Piers has a slightly closer relationship with her.  ... The only thing I'm worried about with Susan Boyle is that she seems to have a crush on Piers Morgan. ... I think that Piers kind of reassured her during the final that she was doing well and that she mustn't pay any kind of attention to the press and all the other stuff that was going . King: Despite all the tumult, there's no disputing that Susan sang her heart out during the finale of the competition. I know the dance troupe [Diversity] was terrific. But, frankly, why didn't she win? Holden: Honestly, I can't criticize the decision because it was the British public that voted in the end. I have no real idea, to be honest. I wonder whether it could be that Diversity was utterly fantastic on the show that night. They decimated the show. They really, really were amazing. And I just wonder whether maybe younger people voted and were quicker on the texts than the kind of people that were voting for Susan. But as I keep saying, if Susan is a loser, then surely she is the biggest and best loser that we have in the world. And coming second is no bad thing.  Watch Amanda Holden discuss Susan Boyle Â» . King: She came in, though, [as] a small-town amateur singer, [with] learning disabilities due to suffering oxygen deprivation at birth. Some say the program exploited her and her vulnerabilities. Do you agree? Holden: I couldn't disagree more. You know, she's a grown woman who applied to come on a talent show. She enjoyed every second of every moment that I met her or saw her behind the scenes. She was very excited. She was very proud to be taking part in the show. I think the downturn in press in our country [Britain], I think, maybe stressed her out a little bit. And I think she was just quite upset about all the exaggerated stories and the kind of falsehoods that were being written about her. I think that everybody gets upset about bad press when you're in this business. And she's somebody that's gone from anonymity to [an] absolute worldwide phenomenon. King: Yes. Holden: So how is she expected to handle that? Nobody can handle that with the best will in the world. I've been in the business 15 years, and I'm still not media savvy. [Dr. Drew Pinsky joins the show] . King: What do you make of this Susan Boyle thing? Pinsky: The problem here is that here's a woman that's suddenly under the scrutiny of the spotlight who maybe has some  developmental issues, who is under tremendous stress and [now] is in a psychiatric hospital. The question is, did the show harm her? King: Did it? Pinsky: It's hard to say. This is the first time these kind of experiences have really been undertaken by people. People that come out of nowhere all of a sudden are international superstars. King: Should we be, Amanda, concerned about that? Holden: First of all, I just want to say that Susan's brother said on British television this morning that, yes, Susan has experienced learning difficulties. But in actual fact, when she was at school, she did as well as any of her other siblings. But throughout her childhood, always before an exam or anything else, she always got quite anxious. [Before the show], she was feeling nervous. But she went out there and she nailed it. You know, she did the best performance that we've seen. And let's not forget, this is actually only the second or third time we've heard her sing. ... She is in a place where celebrities go when they are burnt out. Now, I am obviously not a doctor. I have no factual information to give to you. I can only say to you her brother ... has said she wants to come home within a matter of days, rather than weeks. Pinsky: That's excellent. King: Would you guess, Dr. Drew, that she still has a career in front of her? Wouldn't you bet she does? Pinsky: Oh, I bet she does, absolutely. And she will learn to become accustomed to this kind of stress, I am sure. But let's make sure she has the care she needs. And let's be sure that ... everybody that goes on shows like this has access to things that help them deal with the stress of these kinds of environments.","Amanda Holden: Boyle is ""a grown woman who applied to come on a talent show""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Relatives and friends of a judge and court reporter killed in a 2005 shooting at Atlanta's Fulton County Courthouse took the stand Thursday in the penalty phase of the gunman's trial. Some wept as they spoke of how the deaths have affected their lives and of their continued struggles with sadness, fear and anger. Claudia Barnes, widow of Fulton County Superior Court Judge Rowland Barnes, recalled asking permission to hold her husband's hand one last time before his body was cremated. ""He and I held hands constantly for 13 years,"" she said. She remembered running her hands over the judge's face -- over the temple, where the bullet fired by escaped prisoner Brian Gene Nichols entered his head -- and over the judge's beard, which she always kept trimmed. ""I hope the love of my life did not suffer,"" Claudia Barnes said softly, reading from prepared notes. ""My faith in God has allowed me to remain sane. ... At times, it almost seems too much for me, but I try to do the best that I can."" She said her life with the judge ""was not long enough."" Nichols, 36, was convicted this month of 54 counts including capital murder. He overpowered Fulton County Deputy Cynthia Hall on March 11, 2005, as he was being led into Barnes' courtroom to face a second trial on rape charges. Nichols then took Hall's gun from a lockbox and fatally shot three people at the courthouse: Barnes, court reporter Julie Ann Brandau and Fulton County Deputy Sgt. Hoyt Teasley, who attempted to apprehend him outside the building. Nichols was also convicted of killing David Wilhelm, a federal customs agent, hours later at Wilhelm's home in the Buckhead section of Atlanta. Jurors heard victim impact statements Thursday as part of Nichols' penalty phase, in which they will decide whether he will receive the death penalty sought by prosecutors. As relatives of his victims spoke, Nichols appeared somber, with his eyes downcast, but showed no further emotion. ""Nothing anybody does will bring my daddy back,"" said an emotional Kiley Barnes, the judge's daughter. She said her father raised her from age 2 and ""made it his life's work to conquer becoming a single parent."" She recalled her father asking her to bring him her Barbie doll and show him how to create pigtails on either side of her head, and said the judge once literally gave the shirt off his back to a man at a Christmas party after the man complimented him on it. She said her father shared his passion for the law with her, and she remembered how proud he was at her college graduation, as she was one step closer to becoming a lawyer. Kiley Barnes said she was hoping that after Nichols' conviction, she would feel better because justice had been done. ""Instead, I feel as heartbroken and as lonely as I did on March 11, 2005,"" she said. Brandau's daughter, Christina Scholte Greenway, was an 18-year-old college freshman at the time of the shootings. She told jurors her mother could not attend her graduation from college or nursing school or her wedding last month. ""My husband never got a chance to meet my mother,"" she said. ""I know in my heart that she would have loved him. ... I walked down the aisle wearing her veil."" Brandau's sister, Trudy Brandau, said she lost the only remaining member of her immediate family. The two sisters had grown close after the deaths of another sister and both parents, she said. ""Julie's death changed everything in my life."" Candee Wilhelm told jurors about her husband's death and how she was ""ripped in two"" when he was killed. ""David was simply the most wonderful person I will ever know,"" she said. Both she and sister-in-law Allison Wilhelm spoke of Russell, Wilhelm's mentally challenged brother, who was especially close to him. David Wilhelm planned to become his guardian when his parents grew too old to care for him, Allison Wilhelm said. Candee Wilhelm said she was adopted, and her husband helped her through the difficult process of locating her birth mother. The woman died in 2006, she said, but ""in a way, she was a gift from David."" She remembered looking at her husband's body in the funeral home. ""As I stood there looking at this handsome man, bruised and battered from his murder, I remember thinking, 'This isn't my husband.' I touched his hand, his arm, his leg. David wasn't there anymore. I touched his hair. It was the only thing that really seemed familiar and real to me."" Teasley's widow, Deborah, told jurors she had thought of the courthouse as a ""safe haven"" for her husband. ""I hate to think that he was dying outside on the street,"" she said of her husband. ""But the truth is, he was."" She said her husband ""was and still is our hero. He was the love of my life, my husband and my friend."" Deona Teasley said she was in the third grade when her father died. ""Why did someone do this to such a good person?"" she asked. ""He didn't deserve to die. He did not do anything wrong. ... We meant the world to him, and he meant the world to us.""","NEW: Officer's daughter: ""He didn't deserve to die. He did not do anything wrong""

"(CNN) -- The mayor of Portland, Oregon, publicly apologized Tuesday for lying about a sexual relationship he had with an 18-year-old male in 2005, and for asking the teen to lie about it. ""This was a serious error that happened about four years ago,"" Portland Mayor Sam Adams tells reporters. ""I want to apologize to the people of Portland for my dishonesty and for embarrassing them,"" Mayor Sam Adams, a Democrat, said at an afternoon news conference. But the mayor -- who is openly gay and whose election last year possibly made Portland the largest U.S. city to elect an openly gay mayor -- said he has no plans to resign. ""This was a serious error that happened about four years ago,"" Adams said. ""My job now is to come clean -- I mucked it up -- and to press forward."" Adams returned to Portland from Washington, where he had planned to attend the inauguration of President Barack Obama, to hold the news conference. A day earlier, Adams issued a statement saying: ""In the past, I have characterized my relationship with Beau Breedlove as purely nonsexual. That is not true. Beau Breedlove and I had a sexual relationship for a few months in the summer of 2005 after he turned 18 years of age."" Adams issued the statement Monday after a local newspaper, the Willamette Week, published a story about the relationship between Adams, who was a city commissioner in 2005, and Breedlove, then a legislative intern. During the mayoral campaign, questions had emerged about whether Adams and Breedlove had a sexual relationship. Adams said he had lied about the relationship during the campaign, and had asked Breedlove to lie, because of ""untrue rumors being circulated saying that I had broken the law regarding sex relations with a minor."" ""The allegation coming at me was 'sex with a minor,' "" Adams said. ""But still, I should have told the truth at the time and taken the consequences."" The relationship was consensual and ""although inappropriate, was legal,"" Adams said. ""I'm the one that should be held accountable. I'm the older adult,"" he said. Adams was 42 and Breedlove was 17 when the two met, according to the Willamette newspaper. Adams emphasized that what he called a ""romantic"" relationship with Breedlove did not begin until after Breedlove was 18. Adams said the two had ""maybe three or four dates"" over two or three months in 2005 before the relationship ended. The mayor apologized to Breedlove for asking him to lie, and to Portland's gay community ""for embarrassing them."" It was not clear whether Breedlove was in attendance at Tuesday's news conference. Adams said that ""this is fundamentally an issue of a public official lying."" ""I don't think this fundamentally is an issue about sexual orientation,"" he said. ""Other people can debate that but, for me, it's about an error in judgment and then seeking to make amends for that and being very up-front about the mistake and then carrying on,"" he said. Asked by a reporter if he lied to get elected, Adams said: ""I definitely lied to avoid what I thought was another lie that I couldn't overcome. So, in a way, yes."" Asked if he had thought he could get away with lying, Adams responded: ""I think that's going to be up to my colleagues and the people of Portland.""","NEW: Portland Mayor Sam Adams says he has no plans to resign .

"(CNN) -- For pro-surfers like nine-time world champion Kelly Slater, flying from continent to continent looking for the perfect wave seems like a freewheeling lifestyle, but for amateurs, it requires careful planning. Surfing champ Kelly Slater gains altitude at Hossegor, France, in 2002. Surfers checking out unique vibes at sites in Australia, Fiji, Tahiti, Hawaii and France are driven by the buzz that comes from exhilarating swells, breaking waves and amazing barrel tubes created by truly awesome forces of nature. Unlike other travelers, surfers are interested in surfer-friendly places to crash, snagging the best airline rates for surfboards and where to hang out. Here's Slater's list of five great surfing meccas along with some hints about how to fully enjoy your search for the proverbial endless summer.  See photos of Slater surfing his five great sites Â» . BANZAI PIPELINE, Oahu, Hawaii . Event: Billabong Pipeline Masters, December 8 to December 20, 2009 . ""I grew up mesmerized by it, and it never lets you down,"" Slater said. ""It's just an amazing place to be and a wave that always challenges you."" The vibe: Surfers compare this event to professional golf's Master's tournament. Since the 1950s and '60s, mobs of fans have traveled to view one of the sport's great venues to watch competing surfers. How to get there: To find this quarter-mile long treasure trove of breaking waves, drive southwest of Ehukai Beach Park along the Kamehameha Highway, about seven miles northeast of Haleiwa. During competition season -- in November and December -- visitors can soak up a lot of action on the beach, said Scott Bass, editor at Surfer Magazine. ""It's a unique spot because a large, crazy death-defying surf breaks only 100 yards from shore. It's very accessible as a viewer,"" said Bass.  See map and more photos of Slater's surfing spots Â» . Where to stay: Keiki Beach Bungalows offers tourists the best of both worlds: proximity to the Pipeline and a break from the crowds. Located on the beach about a mile away from Pipeline, the quiet bungalows also provide convenient access to a shopping complex with food and coffee shops about a quarter mile away. One and two-bedroom cottages range from $145 to $220 per night, depending on length of stay. Searching for more elegant digs? Turtle Bay Resort offers hundreds of luxurious guest rooms, suites and cottages not far from Pipeline. On a budget? Less than an hour's drive away, campers can pitch near the Pacific at Barbers Point Beach Park. Where to hang out: Got something sweeter in mind? Matsumoto Shave Ice has become a Hawaiian institution during its 60 years, serving the namesake snow cones, candy and crack seed, an island snack of dried fruits. Where to get lunch: Locals will tell you that hanging out on the North Shore must include a stop at some of the island's tried and true mom and pop shops. Macky's Sweet Shrimp Truck is literally just that -- a brightly painted RV parked in a private lot. Macky's specializes in serving succulent shrimp, rice, fruit and veggies. CLOUDBREAK, Tavarua, Fiji . Best waves: April to October . ""One of the great surf discoveries ever,"" said Slater about Cloudbreak, the name given to a surfing reef about two miles off Fiji's island of Tavarua. The South Pacific waters off Fiji offer the perfect temperature and a ""really good swell window"" for timing waves, Slater said. ""The wave has so many different faces to it. It's challenging and perfect."" The vibe: Exclusive. The Tavarua Resort on the island controls access to the reef. How to get there: Surfing Cloudbreak can cost you, both physically and monetarily because of its distance off the island and the expense of traveling to the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Surfers get to the reef on local boats or jet-skis -- or by paddling on their boards, which will take a lot out of you. Where to stay/hang out: Options are very limited. Surfer tourists can expect to spend at least $200 per night at the island resort. SNAPPER ROCKS, Kirra, Australia . Event: Quiksilver Pro Gold Coast February 28 to March 11, 2009 . It's no secret that surfing is a national pastime in Australia, especially during pro-surfing competitions in February and March, when the weather is toasty warm and the water is aqua blue. How to get there: Arrive at the Gold Coast airport at Coolangatta or at the airport in Brisbane, which is about 68 miles (109 kilometers) to the north on the Pacific Motorway. The stretch of breaking waves between Snapper Rocks and Kirra is called the Superbank. The waves are ""perfect, hollow, fast,"" said Slater. Superbank's sandy-bottom, barrel point break makes it worthy of his list. ""On its day, it's the wave you would draw on your school books,"" he said. The vibe: The Gold Coast during competition season is similar to Spring Break in the United States, said Bass, a globetrotting surfer who has produced a documentary about the Vietnam War's surfing soldiers. Gold Coast spectators tend to be young, hip trendy, college-age surf fans. For tourists with wider interests, the scene includes a music festival and skateboard competition. Where to stay: Take your pick. There are plenty of hotels along the Gold Coast, ranging from upscale three or four-star destinations to modest beach motels. For $20 (Australian) you can grab a bunk bed in a backpacker hostel. At the posh Palazzo Versace, you can spend thousands of dollars for one night's lodging. Apartments near the shore run from $80 to $250 Australian per night. Book early if possible. TEAHUPOO, Tahiti . Event: Billabong Pro Teahupoo May 9 to May 20, 2009 . Cloudbreak's remoteness is matched by Tahiti's Teahupoo, which is described by Slater as ""one of the most challenging waves and confronting waves in the world."" When negotiating Teahupoo's South Pacific monster waves, said Slater, ""Just make a decision and follow it. No second guessing."" The vibe: Teahupoo is very exclusive and expensive, according to Bass. ""It's a grand spectacle along the same lines as the Pipeline, just not as accessible."" How to get there: You might have to pay a boater for transportation to the wave, which is about a quarter mile off shore, said Bass. Where to stay/hang out: Small pensions,homes that island residents rent to tourists, are the way to go in Tahiti, said Bass. Hiti Moana Villa offers bungalows for $110 to $160 per night. HOSSEGOR, France . Event: Quiksilver Pro France September 23 to October 4, 2009 . For nonsurfers, Hossegor is a big secret. ""People don't realize how good the surf is there but it's incredible very often,"" said Slater. The elbow-shaped Bay of Biscay near the French-Spanish border offers ""lots of swell and good weather that Ireland and England don't get."" The vibe: More waves, more surfing, less competition. The Hossegor area offers many fine beach breaks that result in abundant waves. These ""peaky"" beach breaks democratize the surfing experience. With more good waves, there's less jockeying among surfers for position. During most of the year, surfers will need to wear a wet suit. The Bay of Biscay is really cold. Where to hang out: The area has great food, according to Slater, and, ""Spain is just right next door for something different."" Across the Spanish border, surfers can discover crashing waves along the shore of San Sebastian, the town made famous in Hemingway's ""The Sun Also Rises."" Continue down the coast to experience amazing waves off the Spanish towns of Zarautz and Mendexa. There, surfers will discover a pure point break, with waves breaking off cobblestone rocks on the ocean floor. Where to stay: All along the coast are dozens of beach hostels offering low-cost lodging. Also, there's camping in the area, if you feel like really roughing it. The Hortensias du Lac hotel offers rooms from â¬170 to â¬220 per night. How to get there: From Paris, drive about 6 hours southwest to Bordeaux and then drive about 2 hours south to Hossegor. By train from Paris takes about 6 hours and costs about $130. TOTING  YOUR BOARD . The relationship between surfers and their boards is close. Sometimes very close. Many surfers feel their boards are like a physical part of them. As a result, they accept no substitutes -- or rentals. They bring their boards. Traveling with a 9-foot, 70-pound piece of sporting equipment can be expensive. Several airlines hit surfboard-toting travelers with stiff fees, sometimes hundreds of dollars. But a few carriers will allow surfboards to be checked as baggage free, within certain guidelines. Here's a quick list of policies among major airlines for travel with surfboards as checked baggage: . American Airlines charges a special handling fee. British Airways bans surfboards as checked baggage. Delta Airlines charges a special handling fee. Singapore Airlines offers free baggage check for surfboards within certain guidelines. Otherwise, travelers are charged a handling fee. United Airlines charges a special handling fee. Virgin Atlantic offers free baggage checking within certain guidelines.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- And now, the rejects. The photographs show the Boeing VC-25 making a steep bank not usually seen with passenger aircraft . Three months after the White House released a single photograph taken during a photo op of ""Air Force One"" flying over New York -- a flight that caused panic on the streets below -- the U.S. Air Force on Friday released the remaining 145 photos taken during the flight. The photographs show the Boeing VC-25 -- a military version of a 747 -- making three passes by the Statue of Liberty, at one point accompanied by an F-16 fighter jet and at another point making a steep bank not usually seen with passenger aircraft. That latter move may have contributed to the chaos below. The photographs and several lengthy government e-mail chains were released in response to Freedom of Information Act requests by CNN and other news organizations. The e-mail chains show that the flight's government organizers were aware of many New Yorkers' fears of low-flying aircraft before the April 27 flight, and show a flurry of second-guessing, finger-pointing, damage control and occasional expressions of regret in the hours immediately after the flight.  Watch a compilation of still images of the flyover Â» . ""Thanks for the heads up on sensitivities in the New York area,"" an Air Force colonel wrote in an e-mail two days before the flight. ""This is an issue that PAG [the Presidential Airlift Group] has also been concerned with. As a result, their coordination has been substantial."" But while the White House, the military and numerous federal and local government agencies coordinated the flight, the federal government demanded secrecy, preparing a news release that was to be distributed only if there were media inquiries. Those inquiries came during the morning flight, triggering a quick chain of e-mails among government officials. ""We...need to construct some sort of timeline on when folks became aware of it if that is possible,"" one Air Force official wrote, responding to the public interest. ""I agree we... need to accomplish damage control, but we aren't the POC [point of contact],"" the response reads. ""Nor do I want to become a belly button for NORAD to push on this one."" Wrote one top Pentagon spokeswoman: ""Nothing like having everyone point the finger at someone else so we ALL look like a big bunch of buffoons... can you say Moe, Larry & Curly!??!?!"" In addition to the informal e-mail banter, the documents show the regimented system the Pentagon uses to monitor and respond to breaking news stories. A U.S. Northern Command document offers this ""assessment"" of the story: ""Last 4 hours: Story reported quickly. Covered by AP, CNN, FOX major news outlets. Local reporting very critical, highlighting 'scare' factor. Local populace very critical of event, due to 9-11 sensitivities."" It continues: ""Web site blog comments 'furious' at best. Twitter search reveals 'tweets' regarding two F-16's chasing commercial airliner. Rate of 1 tweet per minute and growing."" ""No positive spin is possible. Admit mistake,"" it concludes. In another e-mail, USAF Col. Scott M. Turner, commander of the Presidential Airlift Group, was doing just that. ""Again, my apologies sir. Real intent here was to honor NYC, not cause mass chaos,"" it reads. The next day, the Northern Command's internal memo included depictions of New York's three major tabloids featuring the headlines, ""Scare Force One,"" ""Just Plane Stupid!"" and ""How Dumb Was This!"" The photographs released Friday, meanwhile, show the presidential aircraft making a steep bank, seemingly well beyond the 30-degree maximum for Boeing 747s carrying passengers, according to one airline pilot consulted by CNN. That may have contributed to the anxiety on the ground. The Pentagon estimated the cost of the flight at $328,835, which includes the Boeing aircraft and the two fighter jets that accompanied it. But, they said, ""the hours would have been flown regardless, and the expenses would have been accrued on a different mission."" The VC-25 aircraft is designated ""Air Force One"" only when the president is aboard. President Obama was not on the plane during the photo op. After the incident, Louis Caldera, the director of the White House Military Office responsible for the flyover, resigned. ""I have concluded that the controversy surrounding the Presidential Airlift Group's aerial photo shoot over New York City has made it impossible for me to effectively lead the White House Military Office,"" Caldera said in a letter to Obama. ""Moreover, it has become a distraction to the important work you are doing as president. After much reflection, I believe it is incumbent on me to tender my resignation and step down as director of the White House Military Office.""","Presidential plane's flight over New York led to panic on ground .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A man accused of entering New York's LaGuardia Airport with a bag containing wires and batteries, sparking suspicion and leading to a large-scale evacuation, was ordered Saturday to undergo a psychiatric evaluation, a prosecutor said. LaGuardia Airport's Central Terminal is being treated as a crime scene. Scott McGann, 32, appeared in court after authorities said he walked into LaGuardia's Central Terminal Saturday morning with what was determined to be a fake bomb. The terminal was reopened after several hours. Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown said McGann was charged with placing a false bomb or hazardous substance in the first degree; placing a false bomb or hazardous substance in a transportation facility; and making terrorist threats. McGann appeared in court Saturday, but his arraignment was postponed, Brown said. McGann is being held without bail. ""The defendant is clearly a very troubled young man,"" Brown said. ""As a result, the Court has directed that he be examined to determine whether he has the capacity to understand the proceedings against him and assist in his defense."" Earlier, officials said McGann wouldn't speak to his lawyer or anyone else. His next court appearance is scheduled for Thursday. McGann allegedly arrived at a checkpoint in the terminal at about 4:50 a.m., carrying a backpack and refusing to answer security questions. Authorities said the officer at the checkpoint was informed that a suspicious package was attached to the bottom of McGann's backpack, and that McGann allegedly grabbed what appeared to be a trigger device with a red button connected to the backpack. McGann allegedly pressed the button several times before a Port Authority officer grabbed the trigger and the package away from him. The package turned out to be a device consisting of batteries, cylinders and electronic components that could have been used to make a bomb, Brown said, but the bomb squad found that it didn't not contain any explosives. McGann had a ticket on a United Airlines flight to Chicago and a seat on two other connecting flights with his final destination Oakland, California, according to a law enforcement official close to the investigation.  Watch passengers talk about the confusion Â» . McGann has three prior arrests in the New York area, the source told CNN. The most recent involved June charges of tampering with evidence and resisting arrest. He was also arrested twice in 2008, the source said. Port Authority spokesman John Kelly said McGann ""was just acting crazy."" The arresting officers described McGann to Kelly as ""extremely disheveled and dirty,"" in a ""near catatonic state"" and ""staring off into space,"" Kelly said. McGann had been homeless for at least a year. Authorities evacuated the terminal after 5:20 a.m., and allowed passengers back in to all areas except Concourse C by midmorning, Kelly said. The concourse was reopened shortly before 11 a.m., according to Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Holly Baker.  Watch the chaotic evacuation scene Â» . Authorities had stopped flights from taking off or landing at the airport, but by a little after 9 a.m., flights resumed, Baker said. Central Terminal is one of four terminals in the airport, which is in the borough of Queens. It is about eight miles from Manhattan. The incident disrupted travel plans for many passengers, and caused American Airlines to cancel 16 flights, said an airline spokesperson.

"(CNN) -- Hoboken, New Jersey, Mayor Peter Cammarano III -- one of dozens of politicians and rabbis arrested last week in a corruption scandal -- has resigned, the city attorney said Friday. Hoboken, New Jersey, Mayor Peter Cammarano III is accused of taking thousands of dollars in bribes. Steve Kleinman said City Council President Dawn Zimmer will be sworn in immediately as acting mayor. He said Cammarano's letter of resignation, delivered to the city clerk at 9:15 a.m., said his resignation would be effective at noon Friday. The Democratic Hoboken mayor was one of 44 people arrested in last week's federal corruption probe. In his letter to the city clerk, Cammarano, 32, denied all criminal wrongdoing, but said the charges have disrupted the city government and his ability to perform mayoral duties. ""It had been my hope and expectation that I could remain in office and perform my official duties until I had the opportunity to resolve the legal charges against me in court,"" he wrote. ""Regrettably, it has turned out that the controversy surrounding the charges against me has become a distraction to me and an impediment to functioning of Hoboken government."" He apologized to Hoboken residents for the ""disruption and disappointment"" the case has caused, but said, ""I am innocent of any criminal charges and I intend to fight the allegations against me."" Authorities said that 29 public officials and associates took hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes, and that 15 people -- including five rabbis -- engaged in money laundering.    Read about some linked to investigation Â» . One of the federal complaints alleges that Cammarano took about $25,000 in bribes from a government witness posing as a real estate developer. Dennis Elwell, 64, the Democratic mayor of Secaucus, in northern New Jersey, resigned Tuesday after being charged with accepting $10,000 from a confidential informant. Elwell's attorney, Thomas Cammarata, said the mayor had decided that resigning was in the best interest of his family and the people of Secaucus, but was not an admission of guilt. ""Dennis pleaded not guilty to the charges, is presumed innocent and will vigorously defend the unproven allegations made against him,"" the attorney said. Other city leaders arrested include Anthony Suarez, 42, the Democratic mayor of Ridgefield, New Jersey, and Leona Beldini, 74, the Democratic deputy mayor of Jersey City, prosecutors said. Earlier this week, Democrats L. Harvey Smith and Daniel Van Pelt -- two members of the New Jersey State Assembly who were among the officials arrested in the probe -- were stripped of their legislative pay and benefits, Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr. announced. When the arrests were announced July 23, prosecutors said investigators had searched about 20 locations in New Jersey and New York to recover ""large sums of cash and other evidence of criminal conduct,"" and executed 28 seizure warrants against bank accounts that they believe were involved in laundering money.","Hoboken, New Jersey, Mayor Peter Cammarano III steps down in wake of scandal .

"(CNN) -- For most people, Post-it Notes are disposable, ordinary office papers used for note-taking and reminders. But for 19-year-old David Alvarez of Leavenworth, Washington, they were the perfect medium for a 10-foot-tall mosaic depicting Ray Charles. David Alvarez, right, made this 10-foot-tall mosaic of Ray Charles using Post-it Notes. Using more than 2,000 of those ubiquitous brightly-colored sticky scraps, Alvarez composed a three-dimensional representation of the famous musician. The piece has just gone on display at Wenatchee Valley College in Wenatchee, Washington, where Alvarez is in his second year of studies.   ""It's something so simple. You can still see the flaps sticking out on some of them,"" he said. ""Naturally the Post-it Note just sort of flaps out.""   While learning new techniques in Adobe Photoshop in a class, he experimented with taking a photograph of Ray Charles and making it look like a mosaic on the computer screen. He then translated this idea into the Post-it work.  He spent three months constructing the mosaic, sometimes sacrificing schoolwork for his art. At least one of his papers for his summer English courses suffered, but he persevered so that he could participate in an art show July 28 at the Stanley Civic Center in Wenatchee.   Originally, the Post-it Notes stayed in this unique format only by virtue of their manufactured stickiness, which does not hold up as well as glue, Alvarez found. When he displayed his work at the show, he monitored the project for 14 hours, continuously replacing notes that were falling off.  The aspiring art teacher now uses glue to hold the notes in place. For his next project, he is considering a mosaic using 4-inch x 4-inch notes, up from the 3-inch x 3-inch size used in the Ray Charles piece.   ""Part of me wants to, part of me doesn't,"" he said. ""It was so hard to align. It took a lot of time and patience.""  E-mail to a friend .","David Alvarez makes mosaic with more than 2,000 Post-it Notes .

"(CNN) -- Piracy is expected to pick up in the high seas off Somalia after a lull caused by monsoon season, maritime officials warned Monday. Suspected Somali pirates sit behind bars during the first hearing in their trial at Aden port court on July 15. The Combined Maritime Forces urged crews to take up safety measures, including using recognized transit corridors in the Gulf of Aden and reporting to the European Union's security center before transit. ""The prior preparation and vigilance of merchant mariners at all times of day and night is more important now than ever,"" said Rear Admiral Caner Bener of the Combined Task Force. International forces made up of more than 30 ships and aircraft from 16 nations will continue patrolling the waters to help fight pirates, according to officials. ""While our ability to deter and disrupt attacks has improved over time, we are constantly adapting the way we do our business as the pirates adapt and modify their tactics,"" Bener said. The waters off Somalia are rife with pirate activity, despite increased measures by military forces and shipping companies to ward off attacks. Heavily armed pirates have struck the busy Indian Ocean shipping lanes and the Gulf of Aden, which connects the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean. They have captured dozens of vessels and hundreds of hostages, making off with millions of dollars in ransom. It was unclear whether a ransom was paid. The Gulf of Aden, off northern Somalia, has the highest risk of piracy in the world.","Earlier this month Somali pirates release German ship held since May .

"(CNN) -- One man's trash is another man's mystery. Nick DiMola holds what he believes are about 60 artifacts and pieces of artifacts from Mexico. Five years ago, Nick DiMola's rubbish removal company was hired to clean out a Manhattan apartment following the death of the owner, abstract artist Clinton Hill. The contents of a barrel that DiMola salvaged from the trash then has today raised a series of questions. What DiMola holds are about 60 artifacts and pieces of artifacts that he thinks are from Mexico, dating to between 300 B.C. and 500 A.D. The mystery, which the Mexican Consulate in New York is trying to solve, is twofold: How much are the artifacts worth? And, if authentic, whom do they belong to? DiMola first saw the collection of pottery and figurines while cleaning Hill's apartment in 2004. He stored the barrel in his warehouse instead of disposing of it, then promptly forgot about it. Last week, DiMola rediscovered the pieces, only this time he told the New York Daily News about what he had found, announcing that he would sell them. That caught the attention of the Mexican government, which is studying the origins of the items and has claimed them. Now, DiMola wants to donate his find, but not necessarily to Mexico, he told CNN. The Queens native was excited about his discovery when he allowed representatives from the Mexican Cultural Institute to examine and photograph nearly all the pieces, DiMola said. His curiosity about them was growing, and he was expecting an appraisal from the government officials. What he got instead was a heads-up about a possible petition to return the entire collection to Mexico. ""My reaction is that that is not very diplomatic,"" DiMola said. ""It's a blow to the jaw."" Ruben Beltran, Mexico's consul general in New York, was not available for comment Tuesday. However in an interview with the U.S.-based Spanish-language TV network Telemundo, he said that if the pieces are part of Mexican culture, the government will try to get them back. But as of now, no one is certain what the pieces are. Howard Nowes, an ancient art dealer who does appraisals, examined a handful of the pieces that DiMola holds. Nowes told CNN he saw a mix of authentic and non-authentic pre-Columbian pieces, which he valued at $3,000. The pieces were broken and weren't very artistic, he said, adding ""from what I can see, it was mostly junk."" Unfazed, DiMola thinks all the pieces probably are worth more than $16,000 total, he said. ""Something like this, you can't put a price on, because I may have a figure that no one has seen before,"" DiMola said. ""There's a big value in these pieces."" The Mexican government isn't taking any chances, and is conducting its own research into the authenticity and significance of the pieces. Museums in Houston, Texas; San Francisco, California and Washington, D.C., have expressed interest in the pieces as well, DiMola said. He said he'd like to donate the artifacts to museums across the country, and some to the Mexican Cultural Institute at the Mexican Consulate in New York City, but that could change if Mexico uses international law to claim the items. The foundation that hired DiMola to clean the house is unlikely to try to reclaim the pieces, said John Koegel, the attorney who handled Hill's estate. When Hill died, he left all his possessions to his lifelong partner, Allen Tran, Koegel told CNN. In turn, Tran bequeathed all of Hill's possessions to a foundation ""to carry out his artistic legacy,"" he said. Hill had some pieces from Mexico in his apartment that were cataloged, but the artist had no strong connection to the country, Koegel said. For DiMola, all the fuss stems from a simple truth. ""Sometimes you find things that are good and salvageable in the trash,"" he said.","Nick DiMola finds Mexican artifacts worth thousands in trash barrel .

"(CNN) -- Two of Turkey's main political parties are pushing for a constitutional amendment to lift bans on headscarves at public universities, a move that has caused concern among Turkey's secular population. The lifting of the ban on headscarves has caused concern among Turkey's secular population. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan initiated the move, saying it would create equality in Turkey's higher education. The constitutional commission will discuss the proposal -- submitted by the AKP and MHP parties -- in the coming days before sending it to the floor for a vote. If approved, it would need President Abdullah Gul's approval, which is expected. Under the proposal, veils, burqas or chaddors -- all of which cover a woman's face -- would not be allowed. Bans on headcoverings were imposed in the early 1980s by Turkey's universities because they were seen as political symbols and conflicted with Turkey's secular governing system. The proposal to change Turkey's constitution sent chills through Turkey's secular population. Women's groups went to parliament Tuesday to voice their rejection. ""This is a direct threat to the republic and its foundations,"" said Deniz Baykal, leader of Turkey's main secular party, CHP. Another CHP lawmaker said she fears that if the proposal is enacted, parents will feel pressure to have their daughters wear headscarves, even in elementary school. Mustafa Akaydin, head of Turkey's Higher Education Commission, is against the proposal. He said that allowing headscarves would be a rejection of Turkey's secular system of government. ""It is an attempt to create a counterrevolution,"" Akaydin said. ""It will be a breaking point."" He said a majority of female high school students at one school were wearing headscarves during last weekend's entry exams -- a rarity in Turkish schools. The Higher Education Commission will meet Friday in Ankara to discuss the proposed changes. E-mail to a friend .","Turkey's ruling party agrees to lift ban on head scarves in universities .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Jaden Smith is getting a small taste of what it's like to walk in dad Will's action-blockbuster shoes. Keanu Reeves stars in the remake of the 1951 sci-fi flick ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" As expected, the remake of the 1951 sci-fi flick starring Keanu Reeves easily replaced ""Four Christmases"" atop the box office leader board with an opening weekend gross of $31 million, according to Sunday's estimates. Despite mediocre reviews, the film held fairly steady throughout the weekend, falling slightly shy of our $36 million estimate. The Vince Vaughn-Reese Witherspoon yuletide comedy came in second with $13.3 million, bringing its three-week total to just under $88 million, while ""Twilight"" faded to the third spot during its fourth week with just over $8 million. The teen vampire romance managed to reach one milestone, however, grossing a total of $150 million -- the amount director Catherine Hardwicke surmised the movie would have to suck in for sequel ""New Moon"" to get the go ahead. Obviously, Summit executives saw the writing on the wall weeks ago and have hired Chris Weitz (""About a Boy,"" ""American Pie"") to direct next fall's follow-up. Rounding out the top five are Disney's doggie flick ""Bolt"" with $7.5 million and Baz Luhrmann's underperforming ""Australia"" with $4.3 million. The weekend's other new major release -- ""Nothing Like the Holidays,"" starring John Leguizamo and Debra Messing -- got coal in its stocking with a measly $3.5 million during its first weekend. Also of note is the Clint Eastwood-starring ""Gran Torino"" (rumored to be the actor-director's last turn in front of the camera). Although it opened in only six theaters (three in New York, three in L.A.), the film scored the best per screen average, $47,333, with a gross of only $284,000.

"(CNN)  -- Michael Jackson's personal chef Kai Chase says June 25 was shaping up as another typical day in the superstar's usually peaceful and orderly home until an urgent plea from Jackson's personal doctor sent panic sweeping through the household. Michael Jackson's personal chef Kai Chase appeared on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" Thursday night. In an interview with CNN's Larry King that aired Thursday night, Chase described the chaotic events that fateful day and what life was like inside the Jackson family before the singer's shocking death. Chase said she was downstairs preparing lunch for Jackson -- being sure to wrap it in Saran wrap because the singer liked his meals served room-service style -- when Dr. Conrad Murray called out for her. Murray is the central focus of a federal investigation into the singer's death, a law enforcement official told CNN on Wednesday. Around noon or a little after, Chase said, ""Dr. Murray comes down the stairs. There was a stairwell that leads into the kitchen. And he's screaming: Hurry! Go get Prince. Call security. Get Prince."" Chase said she quickly got Jackson's oldest son. ""Within minutes, the paramedics are there. And the security is running upstairs, skipping stairs and all of a sudden we're all, you know, panicked,"" Chase told King. ""So the energy in the house had just kind of changed from that happy kind of day that we were having and preparing lunch and having a good time to just kind of eerie.""  Watch Chase's interview with Larry King Â» . Chase said Jackson's daughter, Paris, started crying and calling out for her father as people in the home came to realize how serious the medical situation was. ""We started crying and we all come together in unity in a circle and we started holding hands. And we started praying,"" Chase said. The chef said she was not allowed into the upstairs quarters of the home, but she had seen Michael Jackson downstairs on Wednesday, June 24. Nothing she saw the day before cause her alarm. ""He ate lunch with his children at the dinner table. And then I packed ... his dinner for him to go to his rehearsal. He seemed like he was just, you know, tired,"" Chase said. She attributed the way he felt to his long rehearsals. Chase said Jackson did complain once about his demanding schedule. ""The third day I was there, when I came back, he had told me, 'You know, they're killing me. They're killing me because I'm working too much. I'm rehearsing too much.' "" Between 1 and 1:30 p.m. June 25, Chase said security asked her to leave the home, and she never saw Michael Jackson being transported to the hospital. She didn't learn of Jackson's death until later that day on the radio. Chase said that Murray was in the house often in June and she attributed the doctor's frequent presence to Jackson's rigorous rehearsal schedule for an upcoming series of concerts in London, England. Search warrants filed Thursday in court in Clark County, Nevada, and carried out at Murray's offices imply that investigators looking into his death believe the singer was a drug addict. In his interview with Chase, King pressed for details of evidence of drug use by Jackson: . King: Did you notice oxygen tanks, because if it was Diprivan and they have to measure ... your blood pressure? They also need oxygen tanks if you're giving that drug. Did you notice them? Chase: I saw the oxygen tanks, yes. King: Where were they? Chase: I would see Dr. Murray carrying the oxygen tanks down in the mornings. King: On that morning or other mornings? Chase: No. I didn't see him that morning. I saw him in the afternoon, but other mornings. King: He would carry them down? Chase: Carry them down. King: They were portable oxygen tanks? Chase: Yes. Chase said she just recently learned the warrants to search  Murray's offices cited her name as a suspected alias for Michael Jackson. ""I was just made aware of that from my publicist. I think that is ... appalling. I have no clue what that is about,"" Chase said. She said detectives came to her home right after the death but did not ask her about her name being on any prescriptions. ""I don't know what make of it,"" Chase told King. Chase, who said she's been a professional chef for about 14 years, said she's seen the Jackson children since June 25. ""They're doing great. And I saw them a couple of weeks ago,"" she said. ""And they look great and they're playing with their cousins and having a good time."" Chase said she was first employed by Jackson in March but was let go. She said Jackson asked her to come back to their California residence in June and that the children were happy about her return. She said the children gave her a ""box of happiness"" on return that contained little gifts and letters. One of them read in part: . ""Dear Kai, thank you for the gifts and the gumbo. I hope you enjoy the gift. I think you'll like it. Love, Prince Jackson."" Chase said she said no evidence that Michael Jackson was a poor eater. In fact, she said just the opposite was true from her observations. ""He ate very well,"" she said. ""He ate organic and fresh. He [was] into the health foods and juices and things of that nature."" Chase briefly addressed other subjects: . â¢ On Katherine Jackson, Michael's mother: ""I saw the interaction with them when I went to the home. ... They love their grandma, you know. It's a beautiful bond that they have together."" â¢ On Jackson's ex-wife having visitation rights to her children: ""I think Debbie Rowe should see and raise her children."" â¢ On Jackson's planned London shows: ""We started talking about bringing, you know, video games and stuff to the private jet. And it was just, you know, he was very excited about going on this -- doing this tour. This is his comeback."" Life in the Jackson household -- from Chase's account -- was a loving and cheerful one and that he loved his three children. ""You know, I would bring ... the lunches and set them on the table and they'd all come in and sit, close the door and they'd dine privately. And you would just hear laughter and story-telling and just beautiful things. Those were his babies.""","Kai Chase served as Michael Jackson's personal chef, said he ate well .

This funky 1800s brick house was a speakeasy during the '20s, and it feels like not much has changed since then, as evidenced by the well-used jazz piano and the secret room hidden behind a two-way mirror. Bartenders measure ingredients on scales to ensure exact proportions go into cocktails ($15) made with throwback mixers like frothy egg whites, fresh-brewed bitters and homemade ginger soda. velvettangoroom.com.

"(CNN) -- Michael Jackson's life has ended, but the legal battles over his possessions, his debts and his children are likely just beginning. Michael Jackson, seen here with two of his three children, died suddenly on Thursday. Perhaps the biggest and saddest question is what will happen to the late singer's two sons and his daughter: 12-year-old Prince Michael I, 11-year-old Paris and 7-year-old Prince Michael II. Normally in such cases, care of the children would be taken over by the surviving parent or a close relative. But as with many other aspects of Jackson's life, his family situation was complex, unusual and far from normal. Born to two mothers -- Jackson's ex-wife Debbie Rowe and an unidentified woman who reportedly served as a surrogate -- the children lived and traveled the world with Jackson, their faces often covered by veils and masks when appearing in public. Rowe gave up her parental rights to her two kids with the singer, but later battled to have them restored. She may be considered to take over custody for Prince Michael I and Paris, said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, who has followed Jackson's legal woes for years. ""Certainly any court that is looking at that sort of question will say, if the father dies who is the mother and would we consider giving the children to the mother?"" Toobin said. ""As I understand it, in later years after a substantial amount of time when Debbie Rowe didn't see those children at all, she started to have a relationship with them again. So she'd certainly be an obvious candidate for custody of those two children.""  Watch Toobin talk about Jackson's legal issues Â» . The question of custody for the third child would be even more up in the air since his mother was likely never involved in his life, Toobin added. The three kids are staying with their paternal grandmother, Katherine Jackson, People magazine reported. She may just wind up keeping them, observers said. ""Katherine is the logical choice -- she has all the grandkids and nieces around her but it will be up to the courts,"" said Brian Oxman, a former Jackson family attorney, according to People. ""I wouldn't be surprised if there are more proceedings regarding the children."" Complications may already be looming on the horizon. Katherine Jackson may wish to keep the children, but Michael Jackson wanted them to be taken care of by their nanny if anything happened to him, ABC News reported, quoting Stacey Brown, co- author of ""Michael Jackson Behind the Mask."" Meanwhile, Rowe's former attorney tells People that a judge returned parental rights to Rowe in 2005, so she is the legal parent of her two children with Jackson and can gain custody of them. Chaotic legal life . Instructions specifying who should care for children after a parent's death are often left in a will, but it's not known whether Jackson had one prepared before his untimely passing. ""Michael Jackson led an extremely chaotic financial and legal life. ... Given how chaotic his life was, did he even have a will?"" Toobin said. Beyond the question of Jackson's children, a will may also be key to answering questions about what's left of his estate. The pop star's financial ups and downs have been as well-chronicled as his personal problems, including a near-bankruptcy and the threatened foreclosure of his Neverland ranch. Jackson accumulated almost $500 million in debt by living large over the years, but he also had considerable assets when he died, including his own music royalties and a 25 percent stake in a music publishing library that contained many Beatles songs, Fortune reported. Those assets might prompt new legal battles and it may be a long time before the dust settles. ""[Jackson] was surrounded by some of the sleaziest, most unethical advisers who came in and came out and he has had a tremendous amount of litigation in his life,"" Toobin said. ""His death will be followed by a great deal of further litigation. ... The sad thing about that is that if it does, it will be part of a pattern that those of us who followed Michael's life saw, which is that ... lots of people with no talent, with none of his charisma, with none of his spirit,  lawyers, publicists, hangers on who made money off of his earnings continuing after his death.""","Michael Jackson had three children with two women .

"(CNN) -- Billy Mays always let you know who you were talking to. OxiClean pitchman Billy Mays, king of the ""yell and sell"" technique died Sunday morning at his home in Tampa. ""Billy Mays, here."" The 50-year-old became famous for hawking products like OxiClean (""Powered by the air you breathe!"") and Mighty Mendit (""Before you throw it away, let Mighty Mendit save the day!""). You needed more space in your closet, Mays had a special hanger for that. You wanted to hang a picture without putting a hole in your wall, he had some supernatural putty you needed to know about. You had a spill? One word. Zorbeez. ""I'm a pitchman, my business comes from the pitch, nothing else,"" Mays said recently in an interview with Portfolio. ""My voice, my likeness is my livelihood. That's it. I keep it simple. I pick good products."" Mays died Sunday at his home near Tampa, Florida. The Hillsborough County medical examiner Dr. Vernard Adams said Monday that Mays had heart disease. Listen to the 911 call Â» . Mays' wife, Deborah Mays, released this statement Monday: ""While it provides some closure to learn that heart disease took Billy from us, it certainly doesn't ease the enormous void that his death has created in our lives."" Handsome in a Brawny Towel Guy sort of way, Mays seemed to be as boisterous off camera as he was on, at least in interviews. He once compared his hands to ""weapons"" for the way they would whip around a product like a fast-dancing showgirl. And even when he didn't feel like cracking a smile, he dug deep. ""When I'm up against a wall, that's when Billy Mays performs best,"" he told a Fortune magazine writer earlier this year while driving his Bentley near his home. At the time, Mays' bum hip was hurting him. He had his hip replaced last year and recently talked about using a special gel insole to help him with the pain -- another product he planned to push. How well does that work? Mays had demonstrated it informally in interviews by wrapping his hand in the insole and whacking it with a hammer. That was just Mays: A sunshiny attitude and an ""I've tried it"" believability. Even on Saturday, less than a day before his wife found him dead in their home, Mays was cheerful as he described being conked on the head by falling luggage when his US Airways flight had a rough landing at Tampa International. ""I gotta hard head,"" he said, shrugging.  Watch Billy Mays smile and sell Â» . Mays' success in the $300 billion infomercial industry was his ability to come off sincere, a magical feat for what is, essentially, huckstering, said Marian Salzman, partner at advertising PR giant Porter Novelli. ""He was the everyday Burt Reynolds; Burt in a next-door neighbor format,"" she said. ""Burt Reynolds was not approachable, but Billy appealed to the 'Mrs. I Push My Cart in Wal-mart.'  Friend: ""No better pitchman on Earth"" Â» . ""He was that good looking guy at the end of the cul de sac that you could talk to, and even though you know he was going to talk a lot of nonsense, there was going to be an integrity in there."" Mays often told interviewers of being raised in Pennsylvania, where he played high school football. He left college and began pushing products on the boardwalk in Atlantic City, New Jersey, a vibrant scene a few decades ago. ""There'd be one here, one there, you know, it's just the knife, the slicer, the Vitamix, you know, the Washamatic,"" Mays told ABC's ""Nightline"" in April. ""And there would be tons of people coming in and you just had to, you know, attack these people, stop them, you know, where they're shopping and tell them the story and sell the product."" Perfecting what has been called the ""yell 'n sell,"" Mays traveled around the country, selling various doohickeys and thingamabobs. He met another salesman, Max Appel, a guru of cleaning products, and the two forged a friendship. In 1996, Appel scored a chance to go on the Home Shopping Network and wanted Mays to appear as the pitchman, according to Fortune. That was the day the wood cleaner Orange Glo was born, a golden road that ended in a $325 million pay day when Appel sold the company to Church & Dwight, the maker of OxiClean. Celebrity was on the horizon. In the late 1980s cable TV was taking off as a marketplace as segments of late night airtime were relatively cheap. There was a science to what would evolve as a cottage industry. Keep the pitches short and bright. Demonstrate, don't describe. Noting the commercials air globally, Mays joked with Portfolio magazine that he speaks 57 languages. Affordability is an international language. ""I feel that the magic number on the infomercial, the two-minute spots, it's kind of hard to get past $20,"" Mays told Portfolio. ""That seems to be the magic number. Or $19.95. The best things in life are free and $19.95."" Mays also knew how to make fun of himself, including in a series of promos for ESPN. ""Billy Mays here for ESPN360.com, the revolutionary tool for watching sports,"" he shouts, crouching under a desk and pointing to a cable. ""The secret is in the Internet connection live sports travel on this wire to the back of your desktop!"" Mays had recently starred in a Discovery channel reality show with fellow pitchman Anthony Sullivan, a Briton who has made many think, perhaps at 3 a.m., that purchasing a Smart Chopper is the best move they've made in months. Sullivan and Mays appeared together in a TV Guide television interview to talk about the show. ""America will realize that Billy doesn't shout all the time,"" Sullivan said. ""He has another volume.""","Billy Mays was ""Burt Reynolds in next-door format,"" advertising expert says .

"(CNN) -- Drew Peterson, the former police sergeant who authorities call the prime suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, has been indicted on murder charges related to his third wife, Kathleen Savio, the Illinois state attorney's office said. Drew Peterson was arrested Thursday on murder charges relating to his third wife, Kathleen Savio. Illinois State Police said Peterson was taken into custody about 5:30 p.m. Thursday after a traffic stop near his home. Police had staked out his home all day, said police Capt. Carl Dobrich, but waited for Peterson to leave to arrest him out of concern for his three children, who were inside the house. Peterson, through his attorney, denied any wrongdoing in either case. Wills County State's Attorney James Glasgow said he believes the case is strong and said Peterson is being held on $20 million bond. ""This is an extremely grave and serious matter and it is reflected in the bond,"" Glasgow said. Peterson's attorney Joel Brodsky told CNN's Larry King he believed the bond was excessive and would seek a more ""reasonable"" bond, noting it was the most expensive bond he'd seen in 10 years.  Watch Peterson's attorney address his client's arrest Â» . Charles B. Pelkie, spokesman for the state's attorney in Will County, Illinois, said a grand jury indicted Peterson in the murder of Savio, whose death had been ruled an accidental drowning. Brodsky said in a written statement that prosecutors won't be able to prove their case because ""he didn't do it."" ""There is no evidence that links Drew Peterson to the death of Kathleen Savio or anyone else for that matter,"" Brodsky said. ""Drew did not harm Kathleen; he has said so from Day One. We're obviously disappointed a grand jury indicted him. But an indictment does not mean guilt."" Pelkie said the grand jury continues to meet and is studying the possibility of charges in Stacy Peterson's disappearance.  Watch family members react to the arrest Â» . After Stacy Peterson went missing in October 2007, media frenzy and police scrutiny on Peterson revealed Savio had died mysteriously a few years earlier during a nasty divorce. Savio died just before the division of the marital assets was finalized, making Drew Peterson the sole beneficiary. Savio was found in the dry bathtub of her home. At the time, the death was ruled an accidental drowning. But her family continued to insist that Savio died as a result of foul play. The investigation into Stacy Peterson's disappearance brought renewed interest in Savio's death. Authorities exhumed Savio's body, further tests were conducted, and her death has now been ruled a ""homicide staged to look like an accident."" Brodsky told King he believes the case has always been about circumstantial evidence and that he will bring a pathologist to trial who will say Savio died from an accidental drowning. ""I think the jury's going to see that, in fact, this always has been an accidental death and still is an accidental death,"" Brodsky told King. Kathleen Savio's brother, Nick, told CNN affiliate WLS-TV he received a call from his sister saying Peterson had been arrested.  Watch police arrest Peterson Â» . ""The state police had been telling us the day was coming,"" he told WLS-TV. ""We kept hearing it for about eight months. I'm almost in tears here. It's been so hard for our family."" ""Hopefully, we'll get the justice we've always been waiting for."" Martin Glink, attorney for the Savio family, said they were hopeful the grand jury felt there was enough evidence to charge Peterson. ""We're very happy that the wheels of justice have continued to move and they are pointing in his direction,"" Glink told WLS-TV. The news was also bittersweet for Stacy Peterson's family, who continue to wait for news about her disappearance. ""We have anticipated this coming. We have dreamed about it. We have been patient over it,"" Pam Bosco, spokesperson for Stacy Peterson's family told WLS-TV. ""Now that it's here, it's almost a little bit calm. We're waiting for the storm to calm now. The calm before the storm."" Bosco said while she had not heard about any charges relating to Stacy Peterson's death, she was hopeful those charges would follow. ""We always said from the very beginning that Kathleen and Stacy had one thing in common -- and that was Drew Peterson,"" she said. ""So, hopefully, we'll have news soon about Stacy, too."" Ernie Raines is also relieved about the arrest. His daughter, Christina Raines, is dating Peterson and was living with him before his arrest. Ernie Raines told CNN's Anderson Cooper he was with his daughter and Peterson as recently as last week, when they talked about going to Las Vegas, Nevada, and getting married. Thursday night he spoke with his daughter after the arrest. ""My daughter was terrified, very emotional, upset,"" Ernie Raines said. ""And I tried to tell her from the beginning that this was going to happen, be prepared."" Ernie Raines said more than anything, when he heard about the arrest, he was relieved. ""I'm glad justice finally came -- before he hurt my daughter,"" he said. Police put Peterson's three minor children in the custody of the state's children and family service department. His adult son was contacted, at Peterson's request, to take them, according to Capt. Dobrich. Dobrich said Peterson cooperated with police during his arrest. CNN's Susan Roesgen contributed to this report.","Dad of girlfriend: I'm glad justice finally came -- before he hurt my daughter""

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities indicted 24 people Wednesday on charges of selling, buying or exchanging archaeological artifacts stolen from Native American lands -- part of what Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar called a crackdown on smugglers of such relics. The artifacts include burial and ceremonial masks, decorated pottery and a buffalo-hide headdress, according to a news release from the Department of Justice.  ""Let this case serve notice to anyone who is considering breaking these laws and trampling our nation's cultural heritage that the BLM [Bureau of Land Management], the Department of Justice and the federal government will track you down and bring you to justice,"" said Salazar, who was in Salt Lake City, Utah, to announce the crackdown. President Obama is ""committed to a new relationship with America's first Americans,"" Salazar said, adding that Wednesday's announcements of indictments was a show of that commitment. Officials said the artifacts -- some stolen from grave sites -- were taken from the Four Corners area, so called because it is the intersection of four states: Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico. The area also has a rich history of Native American culture. The Navajo Parks and Recreation Department manages the Four Corners Monument, which attracts tourists as the only point in the United States where four states come together at one point. Authorities recovered 256 artifacts worth about $335,685, said Deputy Attorney General David Ogden. About 150 agents assisted in an undercover investigation that tracked the suspects for more than two years, Ogden said. They had the help of an individual who knew about the smuggling ring, officials said. The investigation is ongoing, said Ogden. The recovered artifacts are evidence, but at some point after the investigation those that are privately owned will be returned to their owners, said Craig Leff, a spokesperson for the Bureau of Land Management. The suspects face charges carrying sentences ranging from one to 10 years in prison for violating the Archaeological Resources Protection Act and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation, Ogden said.","24 indicted for selling, buying, exchanging archaeological artifacts .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- The woman whose death has come to symbolize Iranian resistance to the government's official election results did not die the way the opposition claims, government-backed Press TV said Sunday. A boy lights a candle beside a photo of Neda during a protest against Iranian elections in Frankfurt, Germany. Two people told Press TV there were no security forces in the area when Neda Agha-Soltan, 26, was killed on June 20. Neda's death was captured on amateur video -- most likely by a cell phone -- and posted online. Within hours, she had become the iconic victim of the Iranian government crackdown. Eyewitnesses say Neda was shot by pro-government Basij militiamen perched on a rooftop. But Press TV said the type of bullet that killed her is not used by Iranian security forces. A man who told the state-funded network he had helped take her to a hospital said, ""There were no security forces or any member of the Basij"" government-backed paramilitary present when she was killed. Press TV did not name the man, who spoke Farsi and was subtitled in English on the broadcast. CNN has not identified him and cannot confirm his account.  Watch more about Neda's death Â» . ""I didn't see who shot who,"" he said. ""The whole scene looked suspicious to me."" A second man, whom Press TV identified as Neda's music teacher who was with her when she died, told the station there was ""no security forces in this street"" when she was shot. Press TV did not name the man, who had a gray mustache and ponytail. He spoke Farsi and was subtitled in English as he walked and pointed at what Press TV said was the scene of the shooting. She was with a family friend who is a music teacher when she was killed. He appears to be the man who spoke to the Iranian broadcaster. ""There was no sign of a protest,"" he said. ""We crossed the street to the other side to get a cab... When we reached this spot, a gunshot was heard. There was no shooting here... There were no security forces in this street. There were around 20, 30 people in this street. One shot was heard and that bullet hit Neda."" ""The bullet was apparently fired from a small caliber pistol that's not used by Iranian security forces,"" the Press TV anchor said. Iran has strict gun-control laws that bar private citizens from carrying firearms. U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday he had seen the video of Neda's death and called it ""heartbreaking. ""And I think anyone who sees it knows there's something fundamentally unjust about it,"" he said. The shaky video of her death shows her walking with a man, a teacher of music and philosophy, near an anti-government demonstration. After being stuck in traffic for more than an hour inside a Peugeot 206 -- a subcompact with a poorly working air conditioner -- Neda and the friend decided to get out of the car for some fresh air, a friend of Neda's told CNN after her death. The two were near where protesters were chanting in opposition to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whose calls for an end to anti-government demonstrations have sparked defiance across the nation. Neda, wearing a baseball cap over a black scarf, a black shirt, blue jeans and tennis shoes, does not appear to be chanting and seems to be observing the demonstration. Suddenly, Neda is on the ground -- felled by a single gunshot wound to the chest. Several men kneel at her side and place pressure on her chest in an attempt to stop the bleeding. ""She has been shot! Someone, come and take her!"" shouts one man. By now, Neda's eyes have rolled to her right; her body is limp. Blood streams from her mouth, then from her nose. For a second, her face is hidden from view as the camera goes behind one of the men. When Neda's face comes back into view, it is covered with blood. Iran's ambassador to Mexico -- one of few Iranian officials who has spoken to CNN since the disputed June 12 presidential election -- suggested American intelligence services could be responsible for her death. ""This death of Neda is very suspicious,"" Ambassador Mohammad Hassan Ghadiri said. ""My question is, how is it that this Miss Neda is shot from behind, got shot in front of several cameras, and is shot in an area where no significant demonstration was behind held? ""Well, if the CIA wants to kill some people and attribute that to the government elements, then choosing women is an appropriate choice, because the death of a woman draws more sympathy,"" Ghadiri said. CIA spokesman George Little responded, ""Any suggestion that the CIA was responsible for the death of this young woman is wrong, absurd and offensive.""","Press TV: No security forces in area when Neda Agha-Soltan, 26, was killed .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Search warrants filed Thursday in court in Clark County, Nevada, and carried out at properties of Michael Jackson's doctor imply that investigators looking into his death believe the singer was a drug addict. Dr. Conrad Murray was with Michael Jackson on the day that he died. The warrants, signed by District Judge Timothy Williams and given to CNN by Las Vegas affiliate KTNV, say ""there is probable cause to believe"" that searches would uncover evidence at the Las Vegas home and office of Dr. Conrad Murray of excessive prescribing, prescribing to an addict, excess treatment or prescribing, unprofessional conduct, prescribing to or treating an addict and manslaughter. They cite ""probable cause to believe"" that the premises contained ""records, shipping orders, distribution lists, use records relating to the purchase, transfer ordering, delivery and storage of propofol (Diprivan)."" A source told CNN on Monday that the Texas-based cardiologist allegedly gave Jackson the anesthetic propofol -- commonly known by the brand name Diprivan -- in the 24 hours before he died. A source involved in the investigation into Jackson's death has told CNN that investigators found numerous bottles of prescription drugs in his $100,000-a-month rented mansion in Holmby Hills, California.  Watch report on the warrants Â» . The items taken from Murray's home included copies of his computer and cell phone hard drives. They were to be turned over to the Los Angeles Police Department, which is leading the investigation into Jackson's death last month at age 50. Murray is the central focus of a federal investigation into the singer's death, a law enforcement official told CNN on Wednesday. Authorities have subpoenaed the records of various doctors who have treated Jackson over the years, but ""Dr. [Conrad] Murray is the only one we're looking at,"" the federal law enforcement official said. The disclosures were among several developments Wednesday in a story that continues to gather steam more than a month after the death of the pop icon on June 25. Other recent developments: . â¢ Jackson's father, Joe, acknowledged that a 25-year-old Norwegian performer is Jackson's son -- even as the man himself denied the relationship in various news reports. â¢ Jackson's estate is worth at least $200 million, a source with knowledge of the estate's dealings told CNN. Murray and the drug investigation . Despite the comment from the federal law enforcement official, Murray's lawyer does not think an arrest is imminent because autopsy results into Jackson's death are pending. Police have interviewed Murray twice since Jackson's death. Murray's lawyer, Ed Chernoff, said his client is ready to talk to investigators again, but a meeting has not been scheduled. Murray has consistently denied he prescribed or administered anything that could have killed Jackson.  Watch a profile of Murray Â» . On Tuesday, investigators searched Murray's home and office in Las Vegas, Nevada. Chernoff said he won't comment on ""rumors, innuendo or unnamed sources.""  Watch CNN's Ted Rowlands report on drug allegation Â» . Meanwhile, Murray failed to make a payment of $15,000 on his $1.65 million home in January and has racked up debt since. If he does not make a payment by mid-August, he will lose his home to foreclosure, a spokeswoman confirmed. ""He was to be paid $150,000 a month by Michael Jackson,"" the spokeswoman said. ""He was not [paid] by AEG, the tour promoter, or Jackson, for the two months he worked for them. So he's low on money."" Murray has been beset by financial difficulties since graduating from medical school. He filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 1992 and accumulated $44,663 in state tax liens in Arizona and California from 1993 until 2003, according to court documents. He has also has been hit with several judgments related to unpaid bills, child support payments and defaults on education loans. On Wednesday, CNN learned Murray was arrested on a charge of domestic violence disorderly conduct in Tucson, Arizona, in 1994. Murray's then-girlfriend accused him of having an affair and threw something at him, Tucson law enforcement officials said. Murray allegedly pushed the woman down. The doctor was acquitted five months after the incident. Joe Jackson: Jackson had another son . In an interview with the Web site NewsOne, Jackson's father, Joe, said the singer had another son, a 25-year-old Norwegian performer, Omer Bhatti. ""Yes, I knew he had another son. Yes, I did,"" Joe Jackson said. ""He looks like a Jackson, he acts like a Jackson, he can dance like a Jackson. This boy is a fantastic dancer. As a matter of fact, he teaches dancing."" At Jackson's memorial service this month, Bhatti was seated in the front row between the pop star's father and sister. CNN has been unable to confirm the relationship. And Bhatti has told various media outlets that he and Jackson were close friends. Battle brews over Jackson's will . Jackson's estate is worth at least $200 million and could amount to much more, an informed source told CNN on Wednesday. Earlier this month, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge granted control of Jackson's assets to the executors of his will: John Branca, Jackson's longtime personal attorney, and John McClain, a music industry executive and longtime friend. A third executor, accountant Barry Siegel, recused himself. Jackson's mother, Katherine, now wants the judge to install her in the open slot. The judge has scheduled a hearing on Monday. ""The question is, will all this get resolved on Monday, when there is a hearing?"" said CNN legal analyst Lisa Bloom.

"(CNN) -- Verified Identity Pass Inc.'s Clear security system -- the program that expedited airport security line waits for paying customers -- ended operation Monday night because the company couldn't reach a consensus with its senior creditors, according to its Web site. Clear promised to help passengers avoid security lines like this one at San Francisco International Airport. The New York-based company founded by entrepreneur Stephen Brill targeted business flyers, promising passengers that they would whisk through tedious airport security lanes more rapidly by being placed in private lines. Verified Identity Pass officials couldn't be reached for comment. Clear's fast-lane program began at Orlando (Florida) International Airport in 2005. By the time the company shut down, it was operating in more than 18 locations, including major airports in Atlanta, Georgia; Denver, Colorado; San Francisco, California; and Washington. USA Today reported that the company had about 250,000 members. With nearly 700 million passengers traveling domestically in 2006, Clear company officials touted their program as a way to help avoid bottlenecks and, in some instances, reduce the wait time in security lines to as little as five minutes. Passengers using the Clear program doled out more than $200 a year. After announcing the shutdown, the company released no information on whether customers would receive refunds. John Harrington, a freelance photographer in Washington, renewed his Clear membership for the next two years about a month ago. He said he was disappointed to receive an e-mail from Clear officials saying the program had been terminated. Harrington relied on the quicker lanes when he traveled for assignments out of Reagan National Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport. ""With Clear, I could get into my gate in less than 15 to 20 minutes,"" said Harrington, who is flying to San Francisco next week and will now have to arrive at the airport an hour earlier. ""Try that with regular airport security. It's going to cost me time."" The Clear program required applicants like Harrington to provide information such as a Social Security number and previous address for a background check. The applicant's fingerprints and iris were scanned. The information was placed into a credit-card-size pass and for scanning at an airport Clear booth. After checking in at the Clear booth, customers were shuttled into a separate line overseen by the Transportation Security Administration. In some airports, Clear members were taken to security lanes reserved for them. In other airports, they used employee security lanes. Clear members went through the same security procedures; they had to take off their shoes and take out laptops. Clear arrived at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the busiest airport in the United States, last fall, officials said. At the same time, the airport added 12 security lanes, cutting the average security wait time to 10 minutes, airport spokeswoman Katena Carvajales said. ""Clear shutting down is not impacting our passengers at this airport,"" Carvajales said, adding that customer service officials are stationed near the Clear booths to instruct members on where to go. Some critics argued that the Clear lines were no faster than regular security lines. The Air Transport Association, the industry representing the major U.S. airlines, said the program didn't enhance security. Spokesman David A. Castelveter said airlines already offered frequent travelers and elite members separate lines with no charge. In 2008, the TSA also began expanding its free Black Diamond Self-Select Lanes program to Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, Orlando and Spokane (Washington) International Airport. The program features a series of lanes broken down into categories for expert business travelers who fly frequently, casual travelers who don't fly as often, and skiers or families with strollers who need special assistance. The program has helped decrease wait times at pilot locations in Denver and Salt Lake City, Utah, according to a TSA statement. ""Clear was a personal decision by travelers,"" Castelveter said. ""If they could afford it, then they could buy it, but it didn't offer anything that wasn't already there."" Seven years ago, Congress approved the creation of a speedier airport clearance system that would make the skies safer after September 11 rattled the travel industry. Government officials wanted to vet passengers and put those with a clean history into a separate, quicker line. But government officials worried that potential terrorists could sneak onto the approved list. The government program was handed off to private companies, like Verified Identity Pass, that saw the convenience factor as something they could sell.","Clear security system allowed passengers to use different security lines .

"(CNN) -- Pirates hijacked a British-owned bulk carrier Saturday in the Indian Ocean, but NATO forces stopped an attack on another vessel in the Gulf of Aden hours earlier, NATO maritime authorities said. 11 pirates are arrested by Yemeni security forces in an operation last month. The UK cargo ship, the MV Ariana, was carrying 35,000 tons of soya about 250 nautical miles (287 miles) northwest of the Seychelles when it was seized around dawn. The crew members are Ukrainians and they are not believed to harmed, NATO said. It is unclear how many crew members were aboard the vessel and how it came to be attacked. NATO said it was unaware of ransom demands or any threats against those aboard. NATO said a European Union Protection Aircraft has been deployed to monitor and track the MV Ariana, which is making its way toward Somalia -- the epicenter of the pirate industry. The Seychelles is a republic consisting of a group of islands off East Africa. On Friday evening, a NATO operation conducted by a Portuguese warship disrupted a pirate attack on a Bahamas oil tanker in the Gulf of Aden. The tanker, the MV Kition, broadcast an emergency alert when a pirate-filled skiff approached. NRP Corte-Real, the closest NATO ship, and its helicopter responded and intercepted the pirates. Portuguese Navy special forces boarded a pirate mother-ship. They found and destroyed four AK-47s, a rocket-propelled grenade and four explosives. They seized 19 suspected Somali pirates but released them after consulting with Portuguese national authorities. Piracy has been soaring off the coast of eastern Africa -- particularly Somalia, which has not had an effective government since 1991. Somali pirates have defied foreign navies patrolling the waters and have collected large ransoms from shipping companies. Ransoms started out in the tens of thousands of dollars and have since climbed into the millions. Journalist Ashleigh Nghiem contributed to this report.","Pirates hijack British-owned bulk carrier in Indian Ocean .

"(AOL Autos) -- Letting someone else deal with the day to day expenses of maintaining an automobile (and just paying for what you use) seems to be a novel idea. Joining a ""car share,"" such as the popular Zipcar car sharing service, is gaining in popularity as consumers look to other ways to save money. Car-sharing services let you avoid paying for gas and insurance, but there are fees and rules. By using a car share, you're not only shedding monthly car payments, taxes, insurance and upkeep, but you can let someone else worry about whether the old rattle trap will make it another year. You simply pay a fee and drive the car when you need it. By maximizing the utilization of a single automobile among many users, car sharing services claim they are helping to reduce pollution, too. Every single Zipcar removes about 15 personal cars from the road, the company says. Unclogging traffic and dialing back the amount of single-occupant vehicles burning fuel has a greening effect. Reducing expenses and saving the polar ice caps aren't the only reasons; there's as much justification for joining a car share as you can dream up, from impressing the client at a business meeting with a fancy car to going over the river and through the woods for family gatherings, all without actually owning a car (or paying for its gas or insurance). But is a car share for you? The concept seems best suited to metro areas, where car insurance rates and parking costs can be high. On the other hand, if you work out of your car, use it on a daily basis or live in a more rural or expansive suburban region, you might be better off keeping your current car. AOL Autos: Top 11 distracting things people do in their cars . ""The ideal candidates for car sharing are consumers and businesses in cities where owning a car is costly, where there is good public transit, and where most amenities are within walking distance,"" Zipcar President and COO Mark Norman said. ""In other words, where you don't really need to own a car. In addition, students are ideal car sharing members, given the high cost of ownership as well as the increasing limits on parking on campus."" AOL Autos: Cheapest cars to own . Automobiles can be a huge hassle and expense if you only drive occasionally, so we've set out to look at what car sharing involves. AOL Autos: Pay as you drive insurance . How does it work? The biggest North American car share, Zipcar, aims to be convenient, easy, and technologically savvy. Far more streamlined than an old-school rental car, Zipcar makes getting the use of an automobile about as easy as making a withdrawal from an ATM. The concept of car sharing had its genesis in Europe and has spread to the North American market as interest in frugality and environmental consciousness has increased. AOL Autos: Twenty cars of the future . The first step to using Zipcar is signing up. As a member, you'll get a ""Zipcard,"" which allows you to reserve a vehicle near you via the company's Web site or from a new iPhone application. Once you've reserved a car (or truck -- the beauty of car sharing services is that you can get a big car when you need it, not when you don't), a pretty neat technology unlocks the doors when you walk near your vehicle (we won't bore you with the details, but if you're wondering, it's called radio frequency identification). When it senses the card on you, the doors unlock, at which point, you're on your way. Cars are located all over metro areas (Zipcar gives you a map to the location of the car you've booked). While application approval is usually quick, it takes a few days to get the Zipcard mailed to you. If your city has a Zipcard office, you can pick up your card there. Where can you find car sharing? Car shares are springing up across the U.S., but you're likely to find them in major cities with a traffic problem. Zipcar is the largest service of its kind in the United States, maintaining a fleet of 6,500 automobiles that service 300,000-plus users. Twenty-eight states have at least one Zipcar outpost, and Zipcar has expanded its user base by 100 percent per year since 2004, so new service areas will spring up where demand supports it. Zipcar also operates in Canada, as well as London in the UK. The service is strongest on the coasts, with the Northeast being particularly thick with coverage, but even Des Moines, Iowa has Zipcars available. Zipcar claims that as consumers are moving toward more ""access"" models (such as buying music by the song for your MP3 player), cars could also move in this direction. ""Car sharing has always represented great value for consumers by giving them the freedom of car ownership without the cost and hassles,"" Zipcar's Norman said. ""Now more than ever, in an economic recession and with gas prices on the rise, people and businesses are turning to car sharing. In addition, in an era where people buy music by the song, driving a car by the hour makes a lot of sense."" Municipalities often tout car sharing if a service is available. Check with your city to see if there are any plans to bring car sharing to your city. What are the costs? Since Zipcar is the most popular, we'll take a look at their fee structure for a sample of what car sharing might cost you. Rates vary by city, but on average a Zipcar account costs $75 to startup and there's an annual fee of $50 for an occasional driving plan. Additional drivers from the same household can be added to an account for $25 each. Insurance and fuel are covered -- each Zipcar has a gas card for fillup time. Overstay your reservation, and you'll get whacked for at least $50; late fees are $50 per hour with a $50 minimum. Reminders can be set up so users aren't caught off guard by poor time-management. Extra value plans wipe away the annual fee for a monthly commitment of at least $50. Ideal for heavy users, the rates are lower across the board. Businesses and Universities are also in Zipcar's crosshairs, and the Zipcar fleet could save many businesses money on company cars. AOL Autos: Rental car prices can change in a heartbeat . Zipcar touts its fleet as the most diverse of its kind with everything from Priuses to pickup trucks. There are premium nameplates in Zipcar's fleet that command higher prices -- the cars for the image-conscious versus plain-jane driver. Full-day rentals are $65, and a 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. business day runs $56. Cars come with a full tank of fuel, and you get 180 miles per day before you start paying by the mile. Other car sharing services . Zipcar isn't the only game in town, of course. Traditional car rental services offer one-way rentals, which Zipcar does not; this is something to consider depending on your travel plans. Hertz has jumped into the breech with its ""Connect by Hertz"" product, a veritable clone of Zipcar. Hertz only offers its service in five locations so far: New York City; Park Ridge, New Jersey; Ohio State University; Pepperdine University in California; and Washington D.C. UHaul has also tossed its hat into the ring with its UCarShare service, mostly based around specific college campuses in a small number of locations. UCarShare's rates are higher and terms more restrictive than Zipcar's. Regional players also abound, most based around a particular region. Bay area residents can use City Carshare, Chicago has I-GO, and there are small car sharing services in places like Denver, Philly, St. Louis, or Cleveland. Rates for these competitors vary from on par to more expensive. Terms of service may be different, some offering included miles, some charging for each mile -- it runs the gamut.","It is possible to drive a car when you want without owning it .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Michael Jackson had a level of hero worship on a par with Elvis Presley or the Beatles but he was the first black star to inspire such a massive following around the world. Michael Jackson, the ultimate showman, craved attention and was rarely disappointed. Total worldwide sales of more than 350 million records over his 40-year career give just a hint of the adoration there was for the ""King of Pop."" The fact that his death came on the eve of a comeback tour in London will leave his devotees feeling even more bereft. While his career -- and wealth -- had waned greatly in recent years, there was still enough support for the concerts to sell out at a rate of nearly 40,000 an hour. Fans from as far afield as Japan, Germany and Dubai queued to buy their tickets. Steve Greenberg, founder and CEO of S-Curve Records, was a disc jockey in Tel Aviv, Israel, when ""Thriller"" first dropped and witnessed first-hand how Jackson became an international icon. His was a global appeal, Greenberg said, among fans and artists worldwide. ""He was as big in the Middle East and Southeast Asia as he was in America and Europe,"" Greenberg said. ""He had that universality that not many people had. The Beatles had it, Muhammad Ali had it, but not many other people have had it."" Jackson was known for far more than his music though. Speaking after his death in Los Angeles was announced, U.S. civil rights campaigner Rev. Al Sharpton paid tribute to the work of a ""trailblazer"" in helping people around the world through his charities. How will you remember Michael Jackson? Sharpton added that the song Jackson co-wrote with Lionel Richie, ""We Are the World,"" a 1985 charity single that raised an estimated $50 million for famine relief in Africa, ushered in Live Aid and the era of celebrity philanthropy. Jackson was the supreme showman who had an unrivalled knack of grabbing headlines. From his precocious abilities as the 11-year-old singer in the Jackson 5 to his legendary ""moon-walk"" dance, the star craved attention, and was rarely disappointed.  Jackson ""as big as it gets"" Â» . But in the years after his colossal 1982 hit album ""Thriller"" and its 1987 follow-up ""Bad,"" much of the focus did not cast him in a good light. In 1996 the lead singer of Pulp, Jarvis Cocker, caused a furor at the Brit Awards in London when he invaded the stage during Jackson's performance of ""Earth Song"" in protest ""at the way Michael Jackson sees himself as some kind of Christ-like figure with the power of healing."" Jackson failed to see the humor in Cocker's mockery, responding that he was ""sickened, saddened, shocked, upset, cheated, angry"" by the protest. He also alleged that Cocker had attacked children on stage, something that the Pulp singer denied. But many in the music industry backed Cocker, who was arrested but later released without charge. The theme of children was one that continued to haunt Jackson. In 2002 he caused a public outcry by dangling his baby son Prince Michael II from a third-floor hotel balcony in Germany before the world's press. He later said he regretted the incident.  Watch video of the incident Â» . And in a 2003 interview with British journalist Martin Bashir that was supposed to repair his image around the world, the singer revived allegations of child abuse when he said of sharing a bed with a young boy: ""It's a beautiful thing. It's very right, it's very loving. Because what's wrong with sharing a love?"" A warrant was issued for his arrest on charges of sexually molesting 12-year-old Gavin Arvizo. Jackson surrendered himself to police amid a media furor. In the 2005 trial conducted in the glare of the world's media spotlight, Jackson was cleared of child molestation charges. Following the trial, Jackson's finances took a hit and he was forced to sell his Neverland ranch in California. He later kept a low profile in the United States and spent time in Britain, where his friends included psychic spoonbender Uri Geller and Harrod's owner Mohamed Al Fayed, and also in Bahrain. But in November last year, Jackson was sued by an Arab sheikh at the High Court in London for $7.7 million. They parted ""amicably"" after agreeing a settlement. Jackson had been invited with his children and entourage to Bahrain by the king's son, Sheikh Abdulla bin Hamad Al Khalifa, who lavished money on Jackson and built a recording studio, which he believed would be used to record albums by Jackson using material the sheikh had helped to write. But Jackson insisted there was no valid agreement and that the sheikh's case was based on ""mistake, misrepresentation and undue influence."" He said sums of money paid out by the sheikh were ""gifts."" As fans around the world mourn it is likely Michael Jackson will be remembered as a musical hero -- but also a man with human flaws.","Michael Jackson was adored by fans around the world .

"After years of rising cholesterol levels from fatty diets and pudgy waistlines, there's finally good news, experts say. More people who are trying to lower their cholesterol are actually succeeding in getting their low-density lipoprotein, or bad cholesterol, down to healthy levels. Research suggests that decreasing LDL -- via drugs, exercise and/or diet --  can ward off heart attacks and strokes. However, there's still room for improvement, according to research from nine countries, including the United States and Canada. And there's good reason to stay focused on lowering your cholesterol: Research suggests that decreasing LDL can ward off heart attacks, strokes, and other health problems. In the new study, which was funded by Pfizer and published in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association, an international group of researchers led by David D. Waters, M.D., of the University of California, San Francisco, looked at 9,955 people with an average age of 62 to see whether cholesterol-lowering efforts -- including taking medication or trying diet and exercise alone -- were having the intended effect. For healthy people, the current target for LDL cholesterol is less than 160 mg/dL, and for those with two or more heart disease risk factors, it's less than 130 mg/dL. For people with heart disease, LDL should be less than 100 mg/dL and possibly even less than 70 mg/dL for those at super-high risk. The survey, known as the Lipid Treatment Assessment Project 2, is an update of a similar survey done in the United States in 1996 and 1997. At that time, just 38 percent of Americans in general and 18 percent of people with heart disease who were trying to lower cholesterol actually had their LDL cholesterol under control. Health.com: 4 tips for healthy drinking while dieting . Things have definitely gotten better. Waters and his colleagues found that in 2006--2007, 73 percent of people had their LDL cholesterol in an acceptable range. This included 86 percent of people at relatively low risk of heart problems, 74 percent at moderate risk, and 67 percent at high risk. But just one in three people, or 30 percent, who already had heart disease and at least two other risk factors (such as obesity and smoking) had their LDL cholesterol in the healthy range. About 75 percent of the patients in the survey were taking statins, 16 percent were treated with only diet and exercise, and the remainder took a cholesterol-lowering medication that was not a statin. Statins include brand-name drugs like Lipitor, Zocor, and Crestor, among others. The findings ""should be a wake-up call"" to people who already have or are at risk of heart attack and strokes, says Gregg Fonarow, M.D., the codirector of the UCLA Preventative Cardiology Program, who was not involved with the research. People with cardiovascular disease should not ""assume that just because they're under medical care that they've optimized their cardiovascular health,"" he says. Health.com: Ultimate guide to fresh fruits and veggies . However, Dan Hackam, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of Western Ontario and the Stroke Prevention and Atherosclerosis Research Centre in London, Ontario, says the survey may not be a fair representation of people with high cholesterol. The survey included only people who had been using the same cholesterol-lowering approach for at least three months. ""There's lots of people in the general population who should be on these drugs who aren't on them,"" Hackam says. ""I see a lot of patients who've had heart attacks and strokes who aren't on these medications."" Nevertheless, according to Hackam, the findings are ""very good news."" When the original survey was done, he says, there were just a couple of major clinical trials showing the health benefits of cholesterol reduction with statins. Since then, there have been around 50 such trials, he adds, including some with women, minorities, and seniors. ""There's just so much more awareness now among physicians of the clinical evidence,"" he says. Health.com: 10 celebrity couples: Who's healthy, who's not? Fonarow says there are still plenty of doctors out there who don't treat cholesterol as aggressively as they should. ""The threat to the patient is something that plays out over many years or decades; it's not an immediate threat,"" he notes. This time lag can make it difficult for some people to see the benefits of treating high cholesterol just as aggressively as they would a heart attack, says Fonarow. Hackam says he measures his patients' heart disease and stroke risk by giving them a 12-hour fasting cholesterol test and a scan of the walls of the arteries in their neck. If the scan shows fatty plaques, he recommends cholesterol-lowering therapy even if the patient's cholesterol levels are normal. Health.com: New iPhone apps for healthier, more earth-friendly shopping . Other steps people can take, aside from seeing their doctor, include quitting smoking and exercising more, Hackam says. There's even a home cholesterol test -- just like the home glucose tests used by people with diabetes -- that patients could use. ""People can be very proactive,"" he explains. To find out if your cholesterol levels are where they should be, and what to do if they aren't, Fonarow recommends checking out the interactive Web sites run by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology. Why are more people hitting cholesterol targets? It probably isn't because more patients are taking their medication properly or sticking with their diet, according to an editorial published with the study. It's more likely that the newer cholesterol-lowering drugs do a better job of curbing LDL, writes Antonio M. Gotto, Jr., M.D., D.Phil, of Weill Cornell Medical College, in New York City. About half of the study participants were taking one of these newer drugs, he notes. Health.com: The medical tests every woman must have .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States will provide $73 million in aid to Zimbabwe, President Obama announced Friday after meeting with Zimbabwe Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai at the White House. President Obama (right) praised Zimbabwe Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai at the White House on Friday. ""I obviously have extraordinary admiration for the courage and tenacity that the prime minister has shown in navigating through some very difficult political times in Zimbabwe,"" Obama said. ""There was a time when Zimbabwe was the breadbasket of Africa, and [it] continues to have enormous potential. It has gone through a very dark and difficult time politically."" Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe ""has not acted oftentimes in the best interest of the Zimbabwean people and has been resistant to the democratic changes that need to take place,"" Obama said. ""We now have a power-sharing agreement that shows promise, and we want to do everything we can to encourage the kinds of improvement not only on human rights and rule of law, freedom of the press and democracy that is so necessary, but also on the economic front."" The U.S. aid will not be going to the government directly ""because we continue to be concerned about consolidating democracy, human rights and rule of law,"" Obama said. ""But it will be going directly to the people in Zimbabwe."" In a CNN interview following his meeting with Obama, Tsvangirai said he is grateful for the generosity. ""Whether it is humanitarian aid or transitional support, it adds up to the relief that Zimbabwe is seeking,"" he said.  Watch Tsvangirai discuss importance of aid to Zimbabwe Â» . Tsvangirai said he told Obama he would like the United States to use its global influence to assist Zimbabwe in dealing with the challenges it faces. Tsvangirai said he understood other nations' reluctance to support the Zimbabwean government, given Mugabe's controversial history. ""I think it's fair,"" he said. ""I understand it, given our history, and I'm not going to defend President Mugabe."" But, he noted, the two have agreed to work together and help Zimbabwe progress as a nation. In remarks with Obama, Tsvangirai said progress has been made by the transitional government, but much remains to be done. ""It is the problems of implementation,"" he said. ""... even by the standard of our own benchmarks, there are gaps that still exist."" He said he would continue to strive to meet those benchmarks, not for the international community, but because ""it gives [the] people of Zimbabwe freedom and opportunity to grow."" The power-sharing arrangement between Tsvangirai, the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, and Mugabe came after contested elections last year. ""Of course we cannot brush away that history, that sad history,"" Tsvangirai told CNN. But he said he is hoping the country will heal and move forward, and wants even those skeptical of Mugabe to appreciate the transition process. Asked whether he believes Mugabe should retire, Tsvangirai said ""at the age of 85, I think one needs to retire."" But, he said, for his own legacy, it's important for him to be thinking about a ""dignified exit."" ""I think that [the power-sharing government] provides him with this opportunity,"" Tsvangirai said. Asked about his relationship with Mugabe, he said, ""We don't have to fall in love to work together. But we have accepted that we have made an agreement to have a workable relationship between the two political parties."" He said there had been acrimony between the two, but they realized it was not helping the Zimbabwean people. ""We are inspired by people like Nelson Mandela, who had to go for 27 years in jail but still come out and say, 'Let's forget about the past' ..."" he said. He and Mugabe have chosen the process of dialogue rather than violence, Tsvangirai said. ""Let history judge whether this historic experiment was the right course of action.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- As many of the world's industries struggle in the face of global economic hardship, the inaugural Abu Dhabi Yacht Show went ahead earlier this month. On show: The recent Abu Dhabi Yacht Show attracted some of the world's biggest super-yachts. Showcasing some of the top super-yachts in existence, the show symbolizes a luxury industry which is still thriving in the area. At the show, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, said the United Arab Emirates is becoming one of the world's greatest super-yacht hubs. ""This show demonstrates Abu Dhabi's commitment to be recognized as a global super-yacht player at the same level as leading centers in the Mediterranean and the Caribbean,"" he said. Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority chairman, Sheikh Sultan Bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan, hailed the event as proof that the region was still growing and performing well economically. ""It is a clear indication of continuing international confidence in this emirate's robust and resilient economy."" Evidence of positive developments in the region's luxury yacht industry is written all over the emirate. In addition to the yachting infrastructure already complete in Abu Dhabi, a marina is planned on Saadiyat Island, in the historic marine district of Al Bateen. Another marina is planned on Yas Island, where there will be a dedicated mega-yacht marina. In total, 16 new marinas are planned in Abu Dhabi in the next decade. The inaugural Abu Dhabi show also attracted 20 of the world's top super-yachts with a combined value of more than $500 million. Most of the globe's top brokers were also in attendance. Senior yacht broker at Burgess Yachts, Rupert Nelson, told CNN that Abu Dhabi is committing to the industry -- a move which should help the emirate stay one step ahead of other destinations. ""Across the globe this year there has been a huge slow down, but in the Gulf they don't seem to be too worried about it."" Burgess Yachts recently sold a Dubai-built super-yacht called Al Hanem for just under $20 million, he added. Although the industry faces a number of challenges in the Gulf region, Nelson said the growth of marinas, yacht-builders, brokers and other related business should help to create jobs. ""The size of boats there is growing, the number of yachts there is growing ... and it seems they want to continue,"" he told CNN. The question on many lips is whether this growing industry could help the United Arab Emirates, and the wider Gulf region, survive the worst of the wider economic downturn. Probably not, is the answer from regional business experts. But it may ease some of the pain . Middle East business expert and author of ""Dubai & Co: Global Strategies for Doing Business in the Gulf States,"" Aamir A. Rehman, told CNN there are reasons for both optimism and pessimism in the Gulf luxury sector. Earlier this year Rolls Royce reported Abu Dhabi and Dubai had become the biggest and second-biggest markets for their cars after a 48 percent jump in sales during 2008 compared with 2007. Rehman said Rolls Royce's results of  were promising for the wider luxury industry -- and could also indicate potential growth for the super-yacht industry. ""Transportation and the entire infrastructure around transport are important to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). There's significant investment being made in transportation, suggesting potential for growth in related industries."" However, despite the high-profile nature of the luxury yacht industry, Rehman feels there are still limitations. ""The Gulf is a relatively small market overall and the number of high-end buyers, while substantial, may be limited compared to regions with larger population bases.""  Liz Martins, head of Middle East and North Africa in the Country Risk department at Business Monitor International, told CNN the current economic climate would have a lasting impact on the luxury sector. ""I think it's an area where people will cut back. There's still a lot of wealth out there but some of these people have lost a lot of money."" Martins said the boom period of the last decade had reached unsustainable levels of growth and, although the Gulf region doesn't have a ""saving culture"" she predicted some changes. ""We're not forecasting recession for many Gulf states ... but the last few years have been debt-fueled boom and I just don't see things getting back to what they have been.""

"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Angered by what he perceived as the systemic discrimination of the minority Tamils by successive Sri Lankan governments, 18-year-old Velupillai Prabhakaran, armed with just a revolver, set out in 1972 to right the perceived wrongs by forming a militant group. Sri Lanka's defense ministry says this handout photo shows troops with a captured Tamil Tiger craft. That group eventually morphed into the Tamil Tigers, who have engaged in a brutal 25-year insurgency for an independent Tamil state that has left more than 70,000 dead. Along the way, the group has been declared a terrorist organization in 32 countries, pioneered the use of women in suicide attacks and, according to the FBI, invented the suicide belt. It was also behind the assassination of two world leaders -- the only terrorist organization to do so. Over the weekend, the militants offered to ""silence"" their guns after an intense military offensive decimated their ranks, usurping them from their stronghold in the north and east of the country, and cornered the remaining rebels on a small stretch of land.  Watch more on the possible end to the conflict Â» . On Monday afternoon, the Sri Lankan government said it had killed Prabhakaran. If the rebels now follow through on their announcement, the action will potentially mark the end of the longest-running civil war in Asia. Who are the Tamils? The Tamils are an ethnic group that makes up about 12 percent of Sri Lanka's population of about 20 million. They mostly dominate the northern and eastern part of the country. Tamils are mostly Hindu and speak Tamil. That sets them apart from Sri Lanka's majority group, the Sinhalese, who make up 74 percent of the population. They are Buddhists and speak Sinhala. The tension between the two ethnic groups date to the British colonization of the country -- an island in the Indian Ocean, south of India. At the time, the country was known as Ceylon. Many Sri Lankans regarded the Tamils as British collaborators and resented the preferential treatment they received. The tables turned when the country achieved independence in 1948 and the Sinhalese majority dominated government. It was the Tamils then who claimed they were being discriminated against in politics, employment and education. By the 1970s Tamil politicians were demanding a separate Tamil state. It would be called Tamil Eelam. In this climate Prabhakaran emerged with his militant group, formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Who is Prabhakaran? Prabhakaran operated from a secret jungle base in the northeastern part of the country, granting few media interviews and remaining an elusive figure to even many Tigers. He was reputed to wear a cyanide capsule around his neck -- to swallow rather than risk capture. And he reportedly expected the same dedication from his troops. As a result, few Tigers have been captured alive. To Prabhakaran's supporters he was a hero fighting for the rights of his people. The Sri Lankan government deemed him a war criminal with disregard for civilian casualties. He was wanted by Interpol on charges including terrorism and organized crime. In 1975, three years after forming his group, Prabhakaran was accused of fatally shooting the mayor of Jaffna, his birthplace. Prabhakaran was also accused of masterminding the killing of then-Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 in the Tamil-dominated Indian state of Tami Nadu. Sri Lankan authorities allege that Prabhakaran was avenging Gandhi's decision to send Indian peacekeepers to Sri Lanka. Two years later, a Tigers' suicide bomber, allegedly acting under Prabhakaran's orders, detonated explosives that killed Sri Lanka's then-president, Ranasinghe Premadasa, during a rally.  Watch aid agencies fear for Sri Lanka Â» . Who are the Tamil Tigers? The Tigers reportedly number about 10,000, recruited from villagers in Tamil-dominated areas and unemployed Tamil youths who think they were passed over for jobs because of their ethnicity. Their armed struggle began in July 1983 when the Tigers killed 13 Sinhalese soldiers. It led to, what was until then, the largest outburst of violence in the island's history. Hundreds of Tamils were killed, thousands left homeless and more than 100,000 fled to south India. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the Tigers have -- until now -- shown no signs of being overpowered by the Sri Lankan military. The Tigers are infamous for suicide bombings, with men and women strapping on suicide vests for more than 200 attacks against Sri Lankan citizens and dozens of high-profile political leaders. In addition to perpetrating the attacks that killed Gandhi and Premadasa, the rebels have carried out the assassinations of two lawmakers and four ministers. A suicide bomber targeted Sri Lankan then-President Chandrika Kumaratunga in December 1999 while she was campaigning for re-election. She was wounded but survived. The Tigers, however, have refrained from targeting Western tourists out of fear that foreign governments would crack down on Tamil expatriates who raise money for them abroad, the U.S. State Department said. Have there been peace talks? Periodically fighting has briefly halted because of a handful of peace agreements. By February 2002 the Tigers had dropped their demands for a separate homeland in exchange for a power-sharing deal with the government. Norway and some other countries agreed to monitor the ceasefire. A year later the rebels dropped out of the negotiations, saying they were being marginalized. They launched a suicide bombing campaign soon after. What led to renewed fighting? In January 2008 the Sri Lankan government announced it was annulling the nearly six-year-old truce with the rebels, declaring that it would crush the rebels. The fighting intensified with security forces driving the rebels from their strongholds in the east and north of the country. The government asked the rebels to lay down arms; the rebels vowed to continue. Caught in the crossfire were civilians, thousands of whom were displaced and hundreds killed. International aid groups expressed concern that both the government and the rebels disregarded civilian safety even in no-fire zones and hospitals. Both sides blamed the other for civilian casualties and exaggerated accounts of their victories. With journalists not allowed into the battle zones, their claims could not be independently confirmed. On Sunday, the Tigers posted an ""urgent statement"" on a pro-rebel Web site, saying the battle had reached ""its bitter end."" ""We have decided to silence our guns,"" the statement said.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Iran's supreme leader on Friday rejected opposition claims that last week's presidential elections were rigged, describing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's win as ""definitive"" and demanding an end to days of protests. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made his first address since the June 12 presidential elections. In his first speech since the June 12 election outcome sparked the country's worst unrest in 30 years, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the vote accurately reflected the will of the people and accused ""enemies of Islam"" of stoking anger. He warned opposition leaders, who are planning a new rally on Saturday, against staging further demonstrations, saying they would be held accountable for any violence. The ""Islamic establishment would never manipulate votes and commit treason. The legal structure in this country does not allow vote-rigging,"" Khamenei said, in his first address since the elections. He told a large crowd at Tehran University that the ""historic"" 85 percent turnout of more than 40 million people was a ""political earthquake"" and was too large to have been manipulated. ""There is a difference of 11 million votes. How can vote-rigging happen?"" he added.  Watch Khamenei dismiss claims of fraud Â» . Ahmadinejad, whose hardline policies have antagonized Western nations, claimed victory with more than 62 percent of the votes, surprising many experts who had predicted a stronger showing from main opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi. The Ayatollah's speech was likely to come under heavy scrutiny in Iran, amid expectations that, despite conciliatory comments, his strong endorsement of Ahmadinejad will do little to appease Moussavi's emboldened supporters.  Read about Iran's power structure Â» . Moussavi's allegations of ballot fraud and calls for a fresh vote have rallied thousands on the streets of Tehran and other cities, in scenes not witnesses in country since the Islamic Revolution of 1979 toppled its monarchy. The unrest prompted Iran to place restrictions on foreign media, limiting their reports on six days of street protests, police arrests and some outbreaks of violence that have left at least eight people dead. Watch militia crackdown Â» . Khamenei described the dispute over the election outcome as a disagreement within Iran's establishment, accusing ""foreign enemies"" and ""Zionists"" -- including the United States, Britain and Israel -- of fomenting violence, and criticizing international media coverage of the unrest. Britain's Foreign Office confirmed shortly after the speech that it was summoning Iran's London ambassador in response to Khamenei's comments. His speech was punctuated with exhortations from the crowd, including: ""Allah is Great,"" ""Death to Israel,"" ""Death to America,"" and ""Death to Britain."" Expressing support for Ahmadinejad, Khamenei accused rival election candidates of insulting the president in the run-up to the vote. ""They swore and called the president superstitious and called him names, which is embarrassing. They forgot about morality and law,"" he said. Khamenei, who has authorized a partial vote recount, said proper legal channels should be used for any challenge to the election outcome. He called for an end to street protests, warning that perpetrators of violence would face punishment. On Thursday, tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Iran's capital for the sixth day in a row. Some estimates put the total number of participants in the hundreds of thousands. See where protests have taken place Â» . Moussavi spoke through a bullhorn from atop a building to the throngs of marchers who snaked through the city, in what was described as a peaceful protest. He spoke hours after the Iranian government agreed to meet with candidates for crisis talks to discuss complaints stemming from the election. With restrictions on reporting the unrest, much of the news, video and images emerging from Iran have come via social networking sites, often bypassing authorities' attempts to block applications such as Facebook and Twitter. CNN's Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour described Khamenei's address as a heartfelt defense of Iran's establishment but said it was uncertain the opposition would heed his call to end demonstrations.  Watch Amanpour discuss speech. Â» . ""That's the all important question. Whether or not the leaders of the opposition -- Mir Hossein Moussavi -- will call on these people to stop their protests is unclear,"" she said. ""Whether they will end and whether the people on the the streets will listen -- because the protests have been spontaneous. It will be intersting to see after this call from the supreme leader, from whom all power in Iran flows."" Moussavi, who called for a boycott of Khamenei's prayer sermon, was absent from the audience, which included Ahmadinejad and, next to him, parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani, who has previously had a tense relationship with the president. Former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who has been in a power struggle with Khamenei, was not visible on the TV broadcast of the event. Rafsanjani is chairman and overseer of the Assembly of Experts -- which is responsible for appointing or removing the supreme leader. iReport.com: Share images from Iran . In his speech, Khamenei defended Rafsanjani from charges of corruption made by Amhadinejad during a pre-election debate. However, he opened the door to corruption charges against Rafsanjani's relatives. In discussing Iran's support of human rights, Khamenei slammed U.S. policies in Afghanistan and Iraq . He even made an apparent reference to the deaths of people -- what he called the ""burning alive"" of 80 men, women and children -- during the federal siege of the Branch Davidian complex in Waco, Texas in 1993. ""We have raised the flag of human rights through Islam,"" Khamenei said. There have been arrests and casualties in civil unrest, with human rights group Amnesty International saying reports suggest that up to 15 people have died. The government maintains seven people have died. Iranian TV Thursday night aired confessions from people who authorities say were paid to destabilize Iran. It aired remarks from some ""terrorists"" who said the United States paid them to enter from Iraq to committing terrorist acts against the Iranian leadership.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona midfielder Alexander Hleb has turned down a move to Inter Milan in favor of returning to Bundesliga club Stuttgart on loan for the season.

Hleb had been expected to be part of the swap deal that saw Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Samuel Eto'o switch clubs earlier this week. But the 28-year-old Belarus international has opted against joining Cameroon striker Eto'o at the San Siro due to the limited prospects of regular football under Jose Mourinho, and instead decided to return to Germany.

"(CNN) -- A 4-year-old Ohio girl who vanished more than three weeks ago was found alive and in good condition, halfway across the country in southern California, authorities said. Haylee Donathan was found with her mother and her mother's boyfriend, fugitive sex offender Robbie Potter. Haylee Donathan, her mother Candace Watson and Robbie Potter were discovered hiding for the past week at The Morning Star Ranch, a retreat in Valley Center, near San Diego, said Peter Elliott, United States Marshal for the Northern District of Ohio. Potter is a registered sex offender, officials said. He was being sought by the U.S. Marshal's Service. Late Tuesday Haylee was in the custody of a children's protective services agency in the San Diego County area, Elliott said. She was doing well but may have chicken pox, he added. ""We understand she is healthy and happy and I believe, waiting to come back to her grandmother here,"" he said.  Watch authorities announce their find Â» . The journey west took them more than two thousand miles from Mansfield, the north-Central Ohio city where the girl and her mother live. ""I am very happy that my granddaughter's coming home,"" said Mary Watson, Haylee's grandmother. ""And I just want to thank all of you from the bottom of my heart."" Watson, 24, and Potter, 27, were arrested without incident and held by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. When asked their reaction, Elliott said, ""I believe a little shocked that we were able to find them."" Potter and Watson were still using the same vehicle, a 1980s blue Chevrolet pickup truck they drove from Ohio, Elliott said. Watson's hair was a bit darker and Potter also changed his appearance slightly. Authorities had feared Haylee was endangered. Potter, a sex offender, had escaped a half-way house on May 28, the day the girl and her mother fell out of sight. Countless tips came in while they were missing but one in particular led to the breakthrough on Tuesday, Elliott said without elaborating. But a tip from members of the ranch could have lead to the raid and arrest, a ranchmember told CNN. Kevin Carlin, a member of the ranch in the neighborhood of Valley Center, told CNN in a telephone interview that ranch members became suspicious when a former ranch guest saw billboards urging help in finding Haylee and the two adults. Elliott also praised intense national news coverage from programs such as HLN's Nancy Grace and Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell, as well as local media and Clear Channel, which put up missing child billboards across the country. When she is returned to Ohio, Haylee will be placed in the custody of her grandmother, Elliott said. The U.S. Marshals Northern Ohio Violent Fugitive Task Force had offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of 27-year-old Potter. Potter was wanted on a state warrant for parole violation and a federal warrant for probation violation. He is a convicted tier three sex offender, according to the U.S. Marshals Service, a unit of the Justice Department. While on the run, Potter and Watson were reportedly seen on surveillance video on May 31 at a Wal-Mart Store in Marion, Ohio, 40 miles from Mansfield. Haylee was not on that video. Adding to concerns, Watson's roommate, Samantha Covert, said last week in an interview on Nancy Grace that she saw the little girl in bed with her mother and Potter the morning they disappeared. Covert said Watson carried a basket of clothing, pillows and blankets. Watson will likely face state charges, including harboring a fugitive, according to Elliott. In addition to other charges, he said Potter may be prosecuted under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, a federal sex offender registration and self-reporting law that carries a multi-year felony sentence if violated. On its Web site, the Morning Star Ranch describes itself as ""a community of growers of organic, pesticide-free avocados, grapefruit, persimmons, nuts, and other produce."" Elliot said he believed it is a rehab facility and also called it a Christian retreat.","Missing Ohio girl found alive near San Diego, California, authorities say .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Somewhere, it's engraved in stone: ""Thou shalt remove thy laptop from thy bag."" Beginning Saturday, travelers will be able to leave laptops in bags that meet TSA screening requirements. But savvy travelers can begin ignoring that commandment of air travel beginning Saturday, when the Transportation Security Administration begins recognizing the latest innovation in aviation security -- checkpoint-friendly computer bags. The TSA said it has worked with bag manufacturers to address one of the biggest frustrations of air travelers, the need to remove computers from carry-on bags and place them in bins. It asked manufacturers to design bags that give X-ray machines a clear, unobstructed view of the laptops. Some 60 manufacturers responded to the TSA's solicitation, with 40 of them submitting prototypes for testing. About a dozen manufacturers are currently advertising checkpoint-friendly bags. Many of the bags are deceptively simple. One common design resembles a clam shell. The case unzips into two, with one side holding the computer and the other holding computer peripherals, keys and other personal items. All of the bags are devoid of metal zippers, clips and buckles on the side of the bag that holds the computer.  Learn about the TSA's laptop bag requirements Â» . Travelers at Reagan National Airport near Washington had different opinions on the hassles of carrying computers but were uniformly supportive of having checkpoint-friendly bags. ""Sign me up,"" said traveler Seth Robertson, who was carrying a computer bag and a large, stuffed pony, a present for a friend in Nicaragua. Getting the computer through the checkpoint was more difficult than the stuffed animal, he said. ""The laptop, I have to take out of the bag and put it separately,"" Robertson said, whereas the pony, he could ""just stuff right through."" Screeners didn't even look the gift horse in the mouth. The TSA says about one-third of all air travelers carry laptops. And the current screening procedures are cumbersome for travelers who sometimes leave laptops at the checkpoints in their haste.  Watch a screening demonstration with a new laptop bag Â» . In fact, about 4,800 laptops are lost at airport checkpoints every day, according to a study conducted this year by the Ponemon Institute for the Dell computer company. It is not known how may are quickly recovered, an institute official said. But a checkpoint-friendly carrying case could potentially alleviate problems caused when folks grab the wrong computer by mistake, or grab the bag and forget the computer, he said. TSA spokeswoman Ellen Howe said the bags may even improve speed at checkpoints. ""Less time (is) spent putting things in the bin and putting things back in at the other end, so it may help the process along,"" she said. For a bag to meet TSA requirements, it must meet the following five standards: . The TSA says it is not approving or endorsing any bag design, but it says manufacturers have stepped up to the plate, providing a number of bags that qualify.","Checkpoint-friendly computer bags will be eligible for TSA screening Saturday .

"Editor's note: This story is based on interrogation reports that form part of the prosecution case in the forthcoming trial of six Belgian citizens charged with participation in a terrorist group. Versions of those documents were obtained by CNN from the defense attorney of one of those suspects. The statement by Bryant Vinas was compiled from an interview he gave Belgian prosecutors in March 2009 in New York and was confirmed by U.S. prosecutors as authentic. The statement by Walid Othmani was given to French investigators and was authenticated by Belgian prosecutors. Al Qaeda recruits say they received training in how to handle rockets, explosives and bombs. (CNN) -- The interrogations of two accused Westerners who say they trained and fought with al Qaeda in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region provide an inside view of the terror group's organizational structures. Arguably, they shed more light on the state of al Qaeda than any material previously released into the public domain. The documents reveal training programs and the protective measures the terrorist organization has taken against increasingly effective U.S. missile strikes. Bryant Vinas -- a U.S. citizen who says he traveled to Pakistan in September 2007 to fight against Americans in Afghanistan -- stated that between March and July 2008 he attended three al Qaeda training courses, which focused on weapons, explosives, and rocket-based or -propelled weaponry. During these classes, attended by 10-20 recruits, Vinas was taught how to handle a large variety of weapons and explosives, some of them of military grade sophistication, according to his account. Read how al Qaeda is now operating . Vinas stated he became familiar with seeing, smelling and touching different explosives such as TNT, as well as plastic explosives such as RDX, Semtex, C3 and C4 -- the explosive U.S. authorities have stated was used in al Qaeda's attack on the USS Cole in 2000. Vinas also learned how to make vests for suicide bombers. Vinas stated he was also instructed how to prepare and place fuses, how to test batteries, how to use voltmeters and how to build circuitry for a bomb. Read how Vinas met with al Qaeda leaders . According to his account, al Qaeda also offered a wide variety of other courses including electronics, sniper, and poisons training. Instruction in the actual construction of bombs, he stated, was offered to al Qaeda recruits who had become more advanced in their training. Vinas' training during this period was very similar to the training described by members of a French-Belgian group who also spent time in the tribal areas of Pakistan in 2008. Walid Othmani, a French recruit, stated the group were given explosives training and taught how to fire rocket launchers and RPGs. Othmani provided French interrogators with an account of his time in Pakistan after being arrested on his return to Europe. Three other members of his group are now in Belgian custody awaiting trial for ""participation in a terrorist group."" Belgian prosecutors told CNN Othmani has been charged in France with participation in a criminal conspiracy with the aim of preparing a terrorist act. A Belgian legal document detailing his interrogation report was obtained by CNN. Like Vinas, Othmani said the group had been required to sign forms before their training. Othmani stated his group was required to pledge absolute obedience to their handlers and indicate whether they wanted to become suicide bombers. Othmani provided interesting new details about the training facilities being used by al Qaeda in the tribal areas. His group trained in a small mountain shack, a far cry from the large camps al Qaeda had run in Taliban-era Afghanistan, when it had been able to operate with little danger of being targeted by military strikes. Othmani's account made clear that al Qaeda has had to decentralize its operations in Pakistan in response to the growing effectiveness of U.S. Predator strikes. However the wide number of training courses described by both Vinas and Othmani suggest that al Qaeda has been able to adapt well to the new security environment. By operating a larger number of smaller facilities, al Qaeda would also appear to have increased its resilience to attack. Read how al Qaeda is looking for Western targets . While the classrooms are safer from drone attacks than the pre-9/11 sessions on the mountainsides the content seems to have changed to match new targeting plans. Suicide vest and IED construction show how the curriculum is being modified for today's combat with U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Making and handling explosives, as well as fuse construction, show the sessions may also be geared for killing in Europe and the United States. These are the very skills the July 7, 2005 London bombers Shehzad Tanweer and Mohammed Siddique Khan came to Pakistan to learn. Al Qaeda, it would seem, may still want to pull off the spectacular attack in Europe or the United States. Vinas says he took a course in propelled weaponry with Hicham Bouhali Zrioul, a former taxi driver in Brussels, Belgium, whom he first met in March 2008 and formed a friendship with. Vinas stated that when they completed their training, Al Qaeda instructors did a written evaluation of their performance. Vinas had been judged qualified to participate in missile attacks against U.S. and NATO bases in Afghanistan, according to his account. That suggests al Qaeda has maintained its capacity for administration and paperwork even in a harsher security environment. When their training finished in the summer of 2008, Vinas and Zrioul lived in the same house in the mountains of Waziristan. Zrioul managed to acquire a computer which he rigged up to watch jihadist videos. During a mountain walk with Zrioul one day, Vinas says he was told about a new course being taught by al Qaeda called ""international operations"" set up by al Qaeda's head of international operations whom Vinas later identified as Abu Hafith. Hafith, he stated, was responsible for recruitment and direction of terrorist cells, and attacks outside Pakistan and Afghanistan. Hafith was identified by his initials in the legal document but CNN obtained his name from a source briefed on the case. He is believed to be still at large in the Pakistan-Afghan border area. Vinas was told that the training course that Hafith set up focused on kidnapping and assassination, including instruction on the use of silencers and how to break into and enter a property. The revelations raise the possibility that al Qaeda was developing a program of targeted assassinations. Though al Qaeda has carried out some assassinations in the past, most of its attacks in the West have not targeted any particular individuals but crowded areas, such as mass transport. According to Othmani, al Qaeda fighters totaled between 300-500 in Pakistan's Tribal Areas -- spread out in groups of 10. Such decentralization was a function of the growing deadliness of U.S. Predator strikes. Hicham Beyayo, a Belgian jihadist volunteer, said the group moved around a lot because such strikes were known to be ""very effective,"" his lawyer Christophe Marchand, told CNN. The loss of an increasing number of operatives, stated Othmani, prompted an order from al Qaeda's top command for fighters to remain inside as much as possible. In order to keep in touch, jihadists operated a courier service across the region, according to the Frenchman's testimony. The decentralization of al Qaeda's structures appears to have created some costs for recruits. Two members of the Belgian-French group now in custody describe feeling increasingly cut off, bored, and fed up with the primitive living conditions in their mountain shacks, according to documents obtained by CNN and the defense lawyer of one of those charged. They often did not seem to know what their next orders would be or where their handlers would take them. They also described being deeply frustrated at being repeatedly given false promises that they would be able to fight in Afghanistan. Othmani also described the group's frustration at having to pay for their own weapons and training -- at a cost of 1,300 euros each (about $1,800) -- which if true might lend credence to reports that al Qaeda has come under financial strain. Vinas, for his part, made no mention of having to make payments to his handlers. Vinas and Othmani's accounts also suggest that al Qaeda may be having leadership problems. While able to find fresh recruits to replace those killed and arrested, the group seems to have more difficulty replacing senior military trainers and other key operational figures. A former U.S. government official, specializing in counter-terrorism, commented that the insider accounts suggest the same people are leading training as a decade ago. The only difference, there are fewer of them.","Al Qaeda recruit tells of weapons and explosives training courses .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Fans of Michael Jackson lined the streets outside Harlem's Apollo Theater on Tuesday for a chance to pay their respects to the late ""King of Pop"" at the hall that helped launch his career. A hat and glittery glove represent Michael Jackson at the Apollo Theater tribute. The crowd stood eight to 10 abreast in the sun and 80-degree weather for 10 blocks, waiting for hours for a chance to enter the theater. Fans were allowed in 600 at a time, where they lay flowers and other mementos at the foot of the stage and danced to Jackson's music as it played over the sound system. ""We left our house at 4 o'clock in the morning and got here at 9, and we were lucky to get here,"" said Angela Staples, who came to New York from Pennsylvania with her daughter Jasmine. ""I'm so happy about the outpouring of love and the crowd and the people. It's so respectful to Michael."" Those in the hall observed a moment of silence at 5:26 p.m. -- the time Jackson was pronounced dead Thursday in Los Angeles, California. The cause of the 50-year-old singer's death has not yet been determined. An autopsy on the 50-year-old singer was was inconclusive, leaving authorities waiting on the results of toxicology tests to determine what killed him. Fans have been gathering outside the theater since last week to remember Jackson, who at age 9 won a 1967 Apollo amateur night showcase with his brothers in the group the Jackson 5. ""While he went on from the Apollo stage to achieve international fame on an unprecedented level, to us and all of you, he's family because he started out here,"" said Jonelle Procope, the legendary venue's CEO. Jackson became an idol of both black and white fans and was among the first African-American artists to get widespread play on the music-video channel MTV. But in later years, he was known more for a roller-coaster personal life, including extensive plastic surgery, financial woes and a 1995 trial and acquittal on child-molestation charges. The Rev. Al Sharpton, the New York civil rights activist who became a friend of the Jackson family, urged Jackson's fans not to let critics ""scandalize"" a groundbreaking performer. ""Michael wasn't no freak,"" Sharpton said. ""Michael was a genius. Michael was an innovator. You can't take someone with extraordinary skills, extraordinary talent, and make him an ordinary person. He was extraordinary. He lived extraordinarily, and we love him with an extraordinary passion."" The Apollo had been one of the top venues for jazz, gospel and soul artists for decades before the Jacksons' breakthrough.  Sharpton said the theater was home to ""the best and the baddest."" ""You've got to come from the stage of the Apollo and go all over the world to understand Michael,"" Sharpton said. ""We understand his journey, because we were with him every step of the way."" The Jackson brothers' amateur night win led to a $1,000 deal for 31 shows at the Apollo, said Bobby Schiffman, whose family owned the theater. ""Shortly after their appearance, Diana Ross took them on an NBC special that she did, and there was no looking back after that. They just skyrocketed,"" Schiffman said. Jackson at the time ""was a sweet little boy,"" he said. ""He was extremely talented, extremely easy to get along with,"" Schiffman said. ""He always had a smile on his face, and it was a pleasure to see him working in the theater."" CNN's Aspen Steib contributed to this report.","Fans line streets for blocks to pay tribute to Michael Jackson at Apollo Theater .

"(CNN) -- Two snowmobilers died Wednesday in an avalanche on Logan Peak north of Salt Lake City, Utah, a sheriff's department official said.

""Two people were trapped,"" he said. ""They have both been recovered."" The body of only one of them, a male, had been taken down the mountain, he said. Logan Peak's summit is at an altitude of 9,710 feet. Though the area is not off limits to snowmobilers, they had been warned of the danger after a recent snowstorm. ""The media's been putting that in the paper, on the radio and on TV,"" Bilodeau said. ""We are still in extreme avalanche danger,"" he said, and he urged snowmobilers to ""take into account they need to stay in probably the areas that have less of a slope to them."" CNN's Scott Spoerry, who grew up in the area, said a recent avalanche knocked out the water supply for the city of Logan's 47,000 residents. ""Every year, there's a few avalanches,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- For years, Alfonso Torress-Cook followed the rules in his quest to eliminate hospital-acquired infections. Patients at his hospital received large doses of antibiotics and were scrubbed down with alcohol-based soaps, as he and his colleagues aimed to kill every bacterium possible. Search and destroy was the mantra. By upending conventional wisdom, Alfonso Torress-Cook was able to slash hospital-acquired infection rates. Still, patients became sick with bacterial infections after checking in. Some died. ""I never saw anything change. I saw things getting worse,"" Torress-Cook said. Torress-Cook eventually joined Pacific Hospital of Long Beach, in California, where as director of epidemiology and patient safety, he changed the rules and slashed the number of patients who become infected. Torress-Cook is part of a growing movement in medicine that no longer accepts hospital-acquired infections as inevitable complications. Every year, such infections sicken 1.7 million and kill 99,000 people in the United States. At Pacific Hospital, Torress-Cook doesn't go after all bacteria, just the dangerous ones. The staff members at the 184-bed hospital use antibiotics sparingly, feed patients yogurt to replenish healthy bacteria in the gut and bathe patients daily, using a soap that maintains the natural pH of the patient's skin, killing only bacteria that don't belong there. Meet some of the people fighting hospital-acquired infections Â» . Torress-Cook is also obsessive about hygiene: Nurses clean under patients' fingernails and brush their teeth daily. He also enlisted the hospital's cleaning crew as part of the infection-fighting team. Rooms receive a thorough cleaning every day -- more than simply emptying the trash and mopping the floor, he says. Under Torress-Cook, Pacific Hospital's infection rate for the so-called superbug MRSA is down to 0.01 per 1,000 discharges, 430 times better than the national average. Approximately one out of every 22 patients who checks into a U.S. hospital acquires a bacterial infection, adding more than $28 billion to health care costs, according to a 2009 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But there are signs of improvement. Pennsylvania, which requires the most extensive reporting of hospital-acquired infections, saw the annual rate for all infections drop 8 percent, according to the most recent figures available from the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council. And there are other signs of progress. The development and use of a simple checklist for a common procedure that threads a so-called central line to supply medicine directly to the bloodstream has been extraordinarily effective. The checklist made central line infections almost nonexistent at the 108 intensive care units in Michigan that adopted it. More than 1,700 lives -- and $246 million -- were saved in the first three years the checklist was adopted, according to the state hospital association. The checklist is now being adopted in all 50 states and three countries: the United Kingdom, Spain and Peru, says checklist designer Dr. Peter Pronovost, from Johns Hopkins University and Hospitals. At hospitals large and small, raising the head of the bed for patients on ventilators, brushing patients' teeth and taking other precautions have dramatically reduced ventilator-associated pneumonia, another common and costly infection. Mercy Hospital in Coon Rapids, Minnesota, has used these techniques to cut its ventilator-associated pneumonia rate by more than half, to 2.7 cases per 1,000 ventilator days. ""Our goal is zero,"" says Michelle Farber, a registered nurse who is Mercy's senior infection preventionist. Simply requiring hospitals to report their infections has forced them to be more accountable to their patients, says Lisa McGiffert, who heads Consumers Union's Stop Hospital Infections campaign, which among other things has pushed for more transparency. Twenty-six states now have laws requiring hospitals to report rates for urinary tract and other infections. Paul Levy, CEO of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, is a big fan of publishing infection rates. He puts the hospital's rates on its Web site and on his blog. Simply putting the spotlight on hospital-acquired infections keeps the staff focused, he says. Hospitals also have a new financial incentive to cut infections. As of October 1, 2008, Medicare no longer pays hospitals for the added costs incurred by patients who develop catheter-related urinary tract infections and other catheter- or surgery-related infections. McGiffert says there's been a cultural shift in the past five years. ""I think it's moving us toward eradication of infection or at least where infections are rare and will not be accepted,"" she says.","Every year, hospital-acquired infections sicken 1.7 million, kill 99,000 in U.S.
They add more than $28 billion to health care costs annually .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson knew ""exactly how his fate would be played out"" and feared his death would echo that of Elvis Presley, Lisa Marie Presley wrote in an online blog posted Friday morning. Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley in 1994. Presley says, ""I loved him very much"" and believes he loved her. Presley -- the daughter of Elvis, the ""King of Rock,"" and the ex-wife of Jackson, the ""King of Pop"" -- wrote on her MySpace page that she wanted ""to say now what I have never said before because I want the truth out there for once."" Her publicist confirmed Presley wrote the blog. She said her short marriage to Jackson -- from May 1994 until January 1996 -- ""was not 'a sham' as is being reported in the press,"" but she divorced him because she was ""in over my head in trying"" to save Jackson ""from the inevitable, which is what has just happened."" Jackson talked with her about his death during ""a deep conversation"" 14 years ago about ""the circumstances of my father's death.""  Watch more from Presley on Jackson Â» . ""At some point he paused, he stared at me very intensely and he stated with an almost calm certainty, 'I am afraid that I am going to end up like him, the way he did,' "" Presley wrote. ""I promptly tried to deter him from the idea, at which point he just shrugged his shoulders and nodded almost matter of fact as if to let me know, he knew what he knew and that was kind of that."" That conversation haunted Presley as she watched television coverage of Jackson's death Thursday, she said. ""I am sitting here watching on the news [as] an ambulance leaves the driveway of his home, the big gates, the crowds outside the gates, the coverage, the crowds outside the hospital, the cause of death and what may have led up to it and the memory of this conversation hit me, as did the unstoppable tears,"" she wrote. ""A predicted ending by him, by loved ones and by me, but what I didn't predict was how much it was going to hurt when it finally happened."" Elvis Presley collapsed in the bathroom of his Memphis, Tennessee, mansion -- Graceland -- on August 16, 1977, at the age of 42. While his death was ruled the result of an irregular heartbeat, the autopsy report was sealed amid accusations that abuse of prescription drugs caused the problem. ""As I sit here overwhelmed with sadness, reflection and confusion at what was my biggest failure to date, watching on the news almost play by play the exact scenario I saw happen on August 16, 1977, happening again right now with Michael (A sight I never wanted to see again) just as he predicted, I am truly, truly gutted,"" she wrote. ""I wanted to 'save him',"" she wrote. ""I wanted to save him from the inevitable, which is what has just happened."" ""The hardest decision I have ever had to make, which was to walk away and let his fate have him, even though I desperately loved him and tried to stop or reverse it somehow,"" Presley wrote. Their marriage, which some suggested was only to help Jackson's image, was real, she said. ""It was an unusual relationship, yes, where two unusual people who did not live or know a 'normal life' found a connection, perhaps with some suspect timing on his part,"" she wrote. ""Nonetheless, I do believe he loved me as much as he could love anyone and I loved him very much."" Presley called Jackson ""an incredibly dynamic force and power that was not to be underestimated."" ""When he used it for something good, it was the best and when he used it for something bad, It was really, REALLY bad,"" she wrote. Presley's blog entry ended with a thank you to those who would read it. ""I really needed to say this right now, thanks for listening.""

"(CNN)  -- Houston Rockets team physician Tom Clanton has said the foot injury currently sidelining Chinese center Yao Ming could threaten the seven-foot-six-inch player's career. Yao Ming's entire basketball future could be in danger due to his persistent foot injury. ""At this point, the injury has the potential for him missing this next season and could be career-threatening,"" Clanton told the Houston Chronicle regional newspaper. ""One of the things we are trying to get is a consensus opinion on that, to make certain there is no option we are overlooking that would provide an earlier return or would be an option for treatment that he would prefer rather than doing additional surgery,"" he added. Yao fractured his left foot last month during a semifinal match against the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Western Conference semifinals and has been visiting specialists ahead of treatment since then. Clanton continued: ""At this stage, he is having no symptoms or physical signs, he has no tenderness, no swelling, no redness. When he came back in, he was feeling like everything was perfect, and he would start rehabilitation and get ready to play. ""The findings on the CT were shocking for him and for us. You don't treat a CT scan; you treat a patient. We are looking for every reason to treat this on clinical findings but don't want to put him at risk for a greater fracture,"" he added. The diagnosis raises doubt over the playing future of one of the biggest stars in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and one of the most famous celebrities to hail from China. Yao is a national hero in his homeland, and the news has prompted a frenzy of postings on the internet, arguing about the why's and wherefore's of his injury. ""He is really tired,"" says one Netizen posting on Sina.com. ""He needs to rest, we cannot let the giant fall!"" ""I wish everything will work out well for Yao Ming,"" says another teenage basketball fan. ""There is always a way to deal with injuries. We should not give up."" Some Yao supporters think he should take a long break -- even for the whole season -- and make a comeback later. ""I think his injury is very bad,"" opines Ma Jian, a TV commentator who played for the Chinese national team. ""With all the weight training the team have put him through in the past seven years, Yao has gained about 20 kilos in his upper body. But his lower body, especially his feet, did not gain much strength to hold his large frame."" The 28-year-old Yao has been a perennial pick for the NBA All-Star teams since moving from the Shanghai Sharks to the Rockets in 2002. Yao also captained the Chinese team as hosts at the 2008 Beijing Games, as well as taking the role of flag-bearer in the opening ceremony. Yao was awarded the honor of ""model worker"" in 2005 by China's ruling Communist Party. However, despite his popularity, Yao still has his share of detractors. Known as ""Yao hei"" -- they are people who are out to smear the player. ""He is a man made of glass,"" says one posting on Sina.com. ""Should we call him Yao the glass or Yao the porcelain?"" asks one rhetorically. Yao is now a multi-millionaire, earning millions of dollars yearly, not just from his NBA team but from lucrative commercial endorsements. Admirers say Yao has done more for improving China's image overseas than any modern-day politician or diplomat. Next to the giant panda, Yao is perhaps China's best known and much loved, icon, in part because exudes a wholesome, feel-good image. ""He is such an affable, likeable guy,"" recalls Colin Pine, who used to serve as his personal translator during his years as an NBA rookie in Houston. His demeanor on and off the court has endeared him to the media and multitude of basketball fans overseas, who admire his modesty and maturity. His loyal fans hope Yao will get an extension of his already long and successful career.","Houston Rockets physician says Yao Ming injury could ""threaten his career""

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Two U.S. filmmakers were injured Saturday when their small plane crashed into a three-story residential building in downtown Nairobi. People gather around the wreckage of a plane that struck a building in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi on Saturday. Dan Parris, 25, and Rob Lehr, 26, both from St. Louis, Missouri, were shooting an independent documentary on poverty in Africa. Both men were hospitalized and expected to survive, according to David Peterka, who was part of the film crew, but was not aboard the plane. He said that all four aboard the plane were Americans. A flight engineer, whose name was not released, was critically injured and was in a coma, Peterka said. The pilot, whose name has not yet been released, was killed in the crash. The crew had been in the east African nation for four days and was shooting video of Kibera, one of the largest slums in Africa. The plane was headed to nearby Wilson Airport, where most light aircraft land in the Kenyan capital. ""The pilot had warned that he was going to hover and go slow,"" Peterka said. ""They were surprised when they went to about 50 feet off the ground --- and then they hit electrical lines and the plane flipped into the building."" Just before the plane crashed, the listening devices went off and they could not communicate with the pilot, Peterka said. Peterka said Lehr, who was ejected because the doors were open for filming, ran back in to rescue the others. Parris crawled out and Lehr, with the help of bystanders, pulled the pilot and the engineer out as the plane burst into flames, Peterka said. ""Local residents were using water, dirt to put the fire out"" before the fire department arrived, Peterka said. ""Before the plane crashed, witnesses said it was flying unusually low,"" said Francis Mwaka, a Kenyan federal communications official. The four-seater plane was owned by African Inland Missions company. No one on the ground was injured, Mwaka said. The crash is under investigation. CNN's Ben Brumfield contributed to this story.","Pilot killed, three passengers injured when plane crashes into building .

"(CNN)  -- Manny Pacquiao's two-round demolition of Ricky Hatton has set up the prospect of the biggest money-spinning fight in the history of boxing. Pacquiao lands a solid right to Hatton on his way to a comprehensive victory. The Filipino knocked out the plucky but outclassed Briton in Las Vegas on Saturday night -- earning him by a conservative estimate at least $2 million dollars per minute. Hatton, who could well now hang up his gloves, will pocket more than $8 million as a consolation. Pacquiao's all-action style is popular with boxing followers and in his native Philippines the theaters which screened his fight live with Hatton were sold out well in advance with a ferocious demand for tickets. But the really big money lies in the Pay Per View (PPV) revenues generated by the U.S. Home Box Office (HBO) network. USA Today reported Monday that early indications from cable companies were that the scheduled 12-round light-welterweight bout could get as many as two million buys. Co-promoter Bob Arum was delighted with the figures especially as initial estimates were suggesting about one million boxing fans would shell out their cash. ""We know based on those early numbers and based on experience the event will perform extremely well. If I had to guess, anywhere between 1.6 million and two million homes, which is a home run,"" he said. The record for a PPV event is the 2.4 million buys for 'Golden Boy' Oscar De La Hoya's May 2007 fight with Floyd Mayweather Jr., which generated a staggering $134 million in revenue. Mayweather, who also beat Hatton in another 'superfight' at the back end of 2007, astutely chose Saturday night in Vegas to announce he was coming out of retirement. Mayweather, nicknamed 'money' because of the enormous revenues he generates, will face Mexico's Juan Manuel Marquez on July 18 in his return to the ring. But the talk of the boxing world is an eventual match up against Pacquiao with the notional pound for pound title at stake as well as a massive pay day. ""If Mayweather wants a piece of the 'little Filipino', just be my guest,"" Arum said before the dust had barely settled on the Hatton fight. With the flamboyant De La Hoya retired after being handed a painful beating by Pacquiao at the back end of 2008, the mantle of PPV king is set to fall to one of the two men who ended his ring career. Despite the global recession, the appetite for top prize fighting remains strong, but it is the more flamboyant characters who draw the biggest audiences. Last November's HBO clash between former pound for pound champion Roy Jones Jr. and the brilliant undefeated Welsh world champion Joe Calzaghe drew less than 250,000 buys. The only potential obstacle to a Pacquiao-Mayweather bout, the dangerous Marquez aside, is the relative sizes of the two men. Mayweather is a natural welterweight and would want a fight at 147 pounds, with Pacquiao, who started his remarkable career at light-flyweight, wanting the match at a lower weight. But big business and money is set to talk and many predict the showdown will come late this year, almost certainly in Las Vegas.","Manny Pacquiao set to make a fortune after beating Ricky Hatton in Las Vegas .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Baz Luhrmann is the type of director for whom the word innovative was invented. Luhrmann and his costume designer wife Catherine Martin, who is a long time collaborator. With a filmography comprising of just three full-length feature films, (and one currently in post-production) Luhrmann has produced a stunning and highly visual body of work that is loved and loathed in equal measures. His films have a tendency to suck the viewer up into a swirling vortex of lush imagery and a lavish production style, often with a frenetic pace that one critic described as being like ""a madman on Benzedrine"". But there is a method to Luhrmann's madness. The trio of films, ""Strictly Ballroom,"" an adaptation of William Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Moulin Rouge!"" all form part of a specific filmmaking technique described by Luhrmann as ""The Red Curtain"" cinema. Luhrmann incorporates traditional theatrical conventions into his films and morphs them to create visual treats in stories set in heightened otherworlds. Simple devices like song and dance are then used to drive the action. He always surrounds himself with the same creative team for all of his projects. His wife, production and costume designer Catherine Martin, who is known as CM, is intrinsic to his striking visual style. In his directorial debut ""Strictly Ballroom,"" Luhrmann injected dazzling colors and energetic dance moves into the stuffy world of ballroom dancing and was credited with making the genre hip again. Luhrmann himself was a ballroom dancer from the age of six, and the film reflects his affection for and intimate knowledge of that world. An intensely personal director who always draws on his own experiences, Luhrmann told CNN's The Screening Room: ""Art and life cannot be separated, they feed each other and creative decisions are based on what will make life rich and what will enrich the story telling. What I make comes from a personal level."" It paid off for ""Strictly Ballroom,"" which became a global hit, winning eight Australian Film Institute Awards, three BAFTAs, and the Cannes Film Festival's Prix de Jeunesse in 1992. In 1996, Luhrmann worked his magic again in ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,"" an MTV-style version of the classic love story set in latter-day Miami Beach, complete with warring gangs wielding automatic weapons. But it was in ""Moulin Rouge!"" that the Red Curtain's opulent and extravagant theatrical style would explode in, spectacular, some would say violent, fashion. Starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, it explored a young writer's foray into the bohemian underworld of Montmartre, Paris. Following the film's box-office success Luhrmann landed a highly lucrative Chanel contract, making a Red Curtain-inspired 2004 film for Chanel No. 5, starring Nicole Kidman. At $36m, it is reputedly one of the most expensive adverts of all time. The maverick movie-maker began his film career as an actor, training at the prestigious National Institute of Dramatic Arts in Sydney, but it wasn't long before he was employing his flamboyant and creative talent behind the scenes. What seems to drive Luhrmann is his huge passion and appetite for all art forms. He is a veritable Jack-of-all trades: a writer-director who has produced theatre and opera pieces, worked as a guest editor for Australian Vogue and in 1999, Luhrmann scored a surprise-hit single with ""Everybody's Free (to Wear Sunscreen)."" Following his Red Curtain trilogy, Luhrmann planned to move onto epic storytelling. He started work on a retelling of Alexander the Great, set to star Leonardo DiCaprio. But the film was set aside when Oliver Stone's version was released -- and flopped -- in 2004. """"My next great passion after musicals is the epic-- telling a recognizable universal story using a vast canvas of a far away place and historical events,"" he tells CNN. ""I embarked on that in my exploration of doing Alexander the Great. At one stage, I was collaborating with DreamWorks and Steven Spielberg. ""We were looking at sets around the world and studios were built in Northern Africa and Thailand. It got a long way down the road but for various reasons, not just because of the competing project, we walked away from it,"" he explains. ""For where we were in our life particularly because we were embarking on a very personal part of our story to have children, it wasn't right. ""It's all about the timing and what is right for your life in that moment in time. We walked away from that and I never regret that for a second."" After a seven-year hiatus, during which he and CM have had two ""magical, incredible children,"" Luhrmann has finally made his epic film, simply titled ""Australia,"" with a budget of $130m, making it the expensive movie ever made in the country. ""Australia"" is a love letter to his home country. In it Nicole Kidman plays an English aristocrat who travels to 1930s Australia to sell a cattle ranch. A grueling journey across country with a rough drover (Hugh Jackman) ends with the pair witnessing the Japanese bombardment of Darwin at the start of the Second World War. ""It's been a long time since we've had those huge banquet like motion pictures, when I was a kid, if a big epic was coming it was a big event and the whole family went,"" Luhrmann says. ""It's big drama, comedy, landscape -- a huge banquet and I would like to invite the audience to this cinematic table."" Luhrmann is unsure if the departure from his normal style is a good career move but is adamant ""it's a good life move."" ""We found our inner spirit enlivened again,"" he says. Luhrmann, (unlike CM), has been thus far overlooked for an Oscar award, but ""Australia,"" a big, bold movie with a vast emotional landscape is just the sort of film the Academy loves. Come 2009, it seems they will no longer be able to ignore Luhrmann's considerable -- and -- inimitable talents. What do you think of Luhrmann's cinematic style? Do you love it or loathe it? Tell us your views in our Sound Off box below.","Baz Luhrmann's early cinema style is known as ""The Red Curtain""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Questions swirled Friday about the possible role prescription medications may have played in the death Thursday of pop idol Michael Jackson, people close to him said. The cause of pop star Michael Jackson's death has not been determined after Friday's autopsy. His autopsy was completed, but further tests must be carried out before the cause of death can be determined, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroner said. Craig Harvey said the tests would take four to six weeks, after which ""we anticipate being able to close the case and issuing a final cause of death."" Among the tests to be carried out, he said, are neuropathology (brain) and pulmonary (lung) tests. Harvey added, ""We know that he was taking some prescription medications,"" but said he was not able to divulge what. The possibility that Jackson may have been taking medication that could have contributed to his death at the age of 50 weighed heavily Friday on a number of people close to the star.  Watch coroner's office discuss Jackson's death. Â» . In 2005, after he was cleared on charges of child molestation, Jackson spent a week at a center run by Dr. Deepak Chopra, a physician who focuses on spirituality and the mind-body connection. During that week, Jackson asked Chopra for a prescription for a narcotic, the doctor told CNN. ""I said, 'What the heck do you want a narcotic prescription for?' And it suddenly dawned on me that he was probably taking these and that he had probably a number of doctors who were giving him these prescriptions, so I confronted him with that. At first, he denied it. Then, he said he was in a lot of pain."" Chopra said he responded to Jackson that there were plenty of other ways for him to handle his pain, but that the arguments were not persuasive.  Watch CNN's Sanjay Gupta discuss Jackson's death Â» . ""For a while, I lost him,"" he said. ""I have had that happen with me with other celebrities in Hollywood. There's a plethora of doctors in Hollywood, they're drug peddlers, they're drug pushers, they just happen to be having a medical license and I hope that this episode today, this tragic death of a great human being, will bring to light the huge problem we have in Hollywood with some of the medical establishment, the celebrity doctors, who not only initiate people into the drug experience, but then they perpetuate it so that people become dependent on them."" Chopra said Jackson had recently gone on a diet to prepare for his planned comeback tour, which was to have begun next month in England, and was excited about his planned resumption of his performing career. ""He was practicing, he was fasting, and yet he wasn't physically in the condition to do this, and he was not confronting his drug addiction, which is the big problem,"" Chopra said. He blamed Jackson's death on drug abuse, though he offered no direct evidence. ""When you have enough drugs in your system, your heart goes into an arrhythmia and your respiration stops,"" he said. ""I think the drugs killed him."" Chopra said he had known Jackson to take the opium-derived painkiller OxyContin at one time, as well as injections of the narcotic pain reliever Demerol ""and other narcotics, and I was really desperate to try to help him, but you know you can't help somebody who would go into denial.""  Watch crowds gather at the hospital. Â» . Jackson typically would refuse to call Chopra for several weeks at a time, the doctor said. ""Then he would call me two or three weeks later and say he was sorry, that he had been busy and it wasn't the drugs -- but it was the drugs."" Chopra, who said he knew Jackson for more than two decades, described him as ""my little brother -- I feel very bad for him."" Brian Oxman, a former attorney for the Jackson family who was with the family in the hospital emergency room on Thursday, also expressed concern about medications the pop star was taking. ""I talked to his family about it, I warned them -- I said that Michael is overmedicating and that I did not want to see this kind of a case develop,"" Oxman told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Friday. He referred to Anna Nicole Smith, the former model and reality TV show star who died of an overdose in 2007. ""I said, 'If that's what's going to happen to Michael, it's all going to break our hearts.' And my worst fears are here."" Oxman emphasized that he did not know what killed Jackson, and was not making accusations against any individual. Jackson's ex-wife, Lisa Marie Presley, said in an online blog posted Friday that she was not surprised by Thursday's news. She said she divorced him in January 1996, after less than two years of marriage, because she was ""in over my head in trying"" to save Jackson ""from the inevitable, which is what has just happened."" Jackson talked with her about his death during ""a deep conversation"" 14 years ago about ""the circumstances of my father's death,"" she wrote, referring to Elvis Presley. The singer collapsed in the bathroom of his Memphis, Tennessee, mansion -- Graceland -- on August 16, 1977, at the age of 42. While his death was ruled the result of an irregular heartbeat, the autopsy report was sealed amid accusations that abuse of prescription drugs caused the problem. The similarity to the ""King of Rock"" apparently resonated with the ""King of Pop."" ""At some point he paused, he stared at me very intensely and he stated with an almost calm certainty, 'I am afraid that I am going to end up like him, the way he did,' "" Presley said.  Watch crowds gather at the hospital. Â» . ""I promptly tried to deter him from the idea, at which point he just shrugged his shoulders and nodded almost matter of fact as if to let me know, he knew what he knew and that was kind of that.""

""A predicted ending by him, by loved ones and by me, but what I didn't predict was how much it was going to hurt when it finally happened."" Her blog can be found online at http://blogs.myspace.com/lisamariepresley . CNN is seeking response from the family. Meanwhile, police -- who had spoken Thursday with Dr. Conrad Murray, who was with Jackson when he died -- were trying to reach him again Friday. A car that Murray had parked at Jackson's home was impounded and may contain medications pertinent to the investigation, said Detective Agustin Villanueva of the Los Angeles Police Department. Public records show the impounded car was registered to a Texas woman who is an associate of the cardiologist, who is licensed in California and Texas and also has an office in Las Vegas, Nevada. CNN's calls to Murray's office were not returned Friday. AEG Live, the promoter of Jackson's planned tour, said their deal with the singer included a dedicated private physician of his choosing and that Jackson chose Murray, his physician of three years. A source close to the family said Murray spent much of the last two months with Jackson, as he prepared for his upcoming concert series. The doctor is said to be cooperating with officials. Jackson was in cardiac arrest when paramedics took him Thursday from his home to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where the music idol was pronounced dead at 2:26 p.m. (5:26 p.m. ET).  Listen to the 911 call Â» . He had been preparing for a comeback tour -- aimed at extending his legendary career and helping him to pay off hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. Jackson began his professional work at age 5, singing with his brothers, before shooting to superstardom as a solo singer. He had numerous No. 1 hits -- the best known being ""Thriller,"" the best-selling album of all time, at an estimated 50 million copies worldwide. After dominating the popular music scene for years, Jackson became reclusive and mired in scandals that included child molestation charges. He reached a settlement with one accuser and was acquitted in another case after a highly publicized trial in Santa Maria, California, in June 2005. Jackson is survived by his three children, Prince Michael I, Paris and Prince Michael II. Condolences and appreciations continued to pour in Thursday from around the world. President Obama said he considered Jackson a ""spectacular performer"" and expressed his condolences to the Jackson family, the White House said Friday. At a briefing with reporters, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said he spoke with the president Friday morning about the death of the pop superstar. ""He said to me that, obviously, Michael Jackson was a spectacular performer, a music icon. I think everybody remembers hearing his songs, watching him moonwalk on television during Motown's 25th anniversary."" But Gibbs said the president also noted that ""aspects of his life were sad and tragic. His condolences went out to the Jackson family and to fans that mourned his loss."" In a written statement, Jackson's second ex-wife, Debbie Rowe Jackson, said, ""Though Michael is now at peace, the world has lost a beautiful and loving soul. I appreciate the outpouring of support and prayer for Michael, all of his family, me and our children, and hope our privacy can be respected at this difficult time.""

"(CNN)  -- The World Health Organization cautioned that the swine flu outbreak could gain momentum in the months ahead, despite claims by the health secretary of Mexico -- the epicenter of the outbreak -- that the virus ""is in its declining phase."" The number of confimed cases of the H1N1 virus continue to multiply. The outbreak is only about 10 days old, and even if the illness is declining, it could return, said Gregory Hartl, the WHO spokesman for epidemic and pandemic diseases, at a briefing Sunday. ""I ... would like to remind people that in 1918 the Spanish flu showed a surge in the spring, and then disappeared in the summer months, only to return in the autumn of 1918 with a vengeance,"" Hartl said. ""And we know that that eventually killed 40 million to 50 million people."" Mexican authorities believe the virus's most active period in Mexico was between April 23 and April 28, and Mexican Health Secretary Jose Cordova described the outbreak as being in decline in his country. As of late Sunday, Mexican health officials reported 568 cases and 22 fatalities linked to the flu. WHO says it has confirmed 506 cases and 19 deaths in Mexico. The world has 898 confirmed cases of the virus, known to scientists H1N1 virus, in a total of 18 countries, WHO said Sunday. The United States has reported 226 confirmed cases in 30 states. The U.S. cases include one death -- a Mexican toddler visiting relatives in the United States. According to WHO, Canada has 70 confirmed cases; the United Kingdom has 15; Spain has 13; Germany has 6; New Zealand has 4; Israel has 3; France has 2; and Austria, China, South Korea, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, Costa Rica and Ireland each have one. In China, officials have quarantined 68 people, including 13 crew members, who were passengers of a Mexico City to Shanghai flight, which carried a passenger who tested positive for the virus, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported Sunday. None of the other passengers has exhibited any flu-like symptoms, one health official said. About another 110 people who were on the Aeromexico plane went on to other destinations, and may face quarantines elsewhere, the news agency said. Fifteen have been quarantined at a Beijing hotel. Shanghai's airport is now barring other Aeromexico planes from landing there, a representative of the airline told CNN. Aeromexico is suspending flights to Shanghai until May 15, the representative said. The airline does not fly to Hong Kong or Beijing. In the United States, New York has the most confirmed cases, with 63, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Texas has 40; California has 26; Arizona 18; South Carolina 15; Delaware 10; Massachusetts and New Jersey each have seven; Colorado has four; Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Virginia, Wisconsin each have three; Connecticut, Kansas and Michigan each have two; Alabama, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Utah each have one. California officials suspended visitation and other ""nonessential activities"" at Centinela State Prison in Imperial County after an inmate was suspected of having swine flu. The case has yet to be confirmed with lab testing. On Sunday, health officials in North Carolina and Pennsylvania announced the first confirmed cases in those states, and Louisiana's governor said his state had seven confirmed cases. The cases from those three states were not immediately included in the CDC tally. In Washington, U.S. Secretary of Health Kathleen Sebelius, appearing on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" warned that even if the flu outbreak wanes, ""it could come back with greater force in the winter and fall, when we get into flu season."" ""So, this is no time for complacency,"" she said. ""We want to stay out ahead of this."" Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's interim deputy director for public health, told reporters Sunday that she was ""heartened"" by Mexican authorities' reports but still is ""very cautious."" ""I know that influenza can be surprising, and the time course here in the United States is later. We believe we're just on the upswing here, and in several parts of Mexico, cases began quite a while ago,"" Schuchat said. ""From what I know about influenza, I do expect more cases, more severe cases and I do expect more deaths,"" she added. ""And I'm particularly concerned about what will happen in the fall."" Acting CDC Director Richard Besser, also speaking on ""State of the Union,"" said U.S. health officials are examining whether people who received flu shots for the swine flu in 1976 may have some level of protection from the current swine flu. ""That's going to play in very, very big as we move forward with our plans around vaccines, because that may help guide some of the issues around who is most at risk at getting this in the future,"" Besser said. Offering a general picture of the state of U.S. efforts to combat the virus, Besser said ""there are encouraging signs."" ""We're not out of the woods yet,"" he said. ""But what we've learned about the virus itself -- it doesn't contain the factors that we know are seen in much more severe flu strains."" While the new virus strain in the recent outbreak has affected humans, Canadian officials said it has shown up at a pig farm in Alberta, Canada. Officials said the pigs may have been infected by a Canadian farmer who recently returned from a trip to Mexico, the epicenter of the outbreak. The pigs have since been quarantined. ""We have determined that the virus H1N1, found in these pigs, is the virus which is being tracked in the human population,"" said Dr. Brian Evans of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. iReport.com: How should H1N1 be handled? Evans and other officials said it is not uncommon for flu viruses to jump from humans to animals, and that it does not pose a risk for consuming pork. The number of pigs infected was not disclosed.

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- ""Slumdog Millionaire"" leaves audiences uplifted. But that is hardly how one of its child stars felt on Thursday. Indian authorities demolished the home of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" child actor Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail. Despite the hit movie's mega-millions in box-office receipts, Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail's life changed little after he returned home to Mumbai, India's, Garib Nagar, or city of the poor. On Thursday, even the roof over the real-life slum dweller's head was taken away as Indian authorities tore down the shanty where Ismail's family lived. Authorities said the home and about 20 others around it were illegally built. Senior Inspector Rahim Sheikh told CNN that the shanties were brought down as part of a municipal drive to clear encroachments on public land. Bulldozers leveled the slum built on a municipal garden, said Sheikh, who is in charge of the locality in Mumbai where Ismail lived. The little boy sat among twisted corrugated metal and other debris, surrounded by filth and squalor. Memories of Hollywood's glitz and glitter were distant as tears streamed down his face. He said his family was given no notice of the demolition and did not have time to remove their belongings. But, they said, they plan to return and rebuild.  Watch 'Slumdog' actor's home razed. Â» . ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is the story of Jamal, an impoverished, uneducated teen who competes on an Indian game show.

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- French Internet users who download files illegally could have their service cut off under a new law enacted by the French government. French filmmaker Luc Besson attended the vote passing the new law into action. The ""three strikes and you're out"" law will see violators getting up to two warnings before their Internet service providers could be allowed to cut service for as long as a year. The tough new legislation sailed through the French Senate this week, even as opponents promised to continue to fight it in the courts. The law sets up a special government anti-piracy agency to monitor ""internauts,"" as French Internet users are called. It will ensure users are paying for movies and music that they download. While there are countries with stricter penalties such as jail time, in France opponents of the law are angry that the new government agency will be outside the judicial process. That means it can disconnect Internet service without oversight. Opponents of the law worry the government agency could be packed with over zealous enforcers who will side with filmmakers and the recording industry, or even invade the privacy of Internet users. The legislation has split France's political opposition, which protested against the new law. The political left -- traditionally supported by performers and artists -- found that on this issue the creative types were on the government's side, seeing the legislation as a way to protect the intellectual rights that are the foundation of their livelihood. Though the new law still faces a court test and may not be compatible with European legislation, the government plans to have the agency up and running by next year.","French Internet users downloading files illegally could have their service cut off .

"(CNN) -- Maybe marriage to Kate Winslet isn't all that bad. Maya Rudolph and John Krasinski star as a couple on the road in the comedy ""Away We Go."" After cruelly dissecting marital malaise in ""American Beauty"" and again, just six months ago, in ""Revolutionary Road,"" Winslet's husband Sam Mendes takes a slightly more optimistic view of family life in the edgy comedy ""Away We Go."" Not that he's offering a whole-hearted endorsement of the institution. Burt and Verona (John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph) aren't legally bound -- she staunchly resists his repeated proposals -- but nevertheless they're a couple about to go nuclear: She's six months pregnant. He sells insurance to insurance companies. She's an illustrator with a lucrative line in anatomical drawings. Nevertheless, they're struggling to make ends meet. ""Are we losers?"" wonders Verona (only she uses a more colorful expression). ""We have cardboard windows... I think we must be."" Insomuch as they have a plan at all, it hinges on the support they're expecting from Burt's doting parents. So it's a nasty wake-up call when Jerry and Gloria (Jeff Daniels and Catherine O'Hara) announce they're taking off for a new life in Belgium -- yes, even before the baby's out. There is a silver lining: Realizing they no longer have any reason to stay, Burt and Verona decide to widen their horizons. They could move to Arizona where Verona's sister lives. Burt has a job prospect in Madison, Wisconsin. Or they have college friends in Montreal. Their destiny awaits them, all they have to do is go out and find it. And away they go. Although the couple racks up a good few miles in their search for home, the movie doesn't betray much interest in location. Arizona is hot and arid. In Montreal they pour gravy on French fries. Don't expect cultural insights. It's never explained how these stragglers can afford such speculative wandering, and when they do find their dream home it's mystifying that it hasn't occurred to them before. Still, the movie's loose-limbed, spontaneous quality is a good part of its appeal, and a refreshing change of pace from other movies by Mendes, whose artfully designed compositions often seem self-conscious and painfully detached. In keeping with Indie-wood's vogue for shuffling snide satire and sentimentality (see ""Juno"" and ""Little Miss Sunshine""), ""Away We Go"" presents its trepidatious travelers with half a dozen starkly contrasted parental figures, including Allison Janney's monstrously vulgar alcoholic, Maggie Gyllenhaal's radical earth-mother (who has shortened her name to ""LN""), and Paul Schneider as Burt's rawly dumped brother, who wonders aloud if it would be wrong to tell his daughter her mom has been murdered. There's a level of bile here that some audiences may find alienating -- I can't see it being a big hit in Phoenix -- but Dave Eggers' and Vendela Vida's writing is a cut above the average, and it's performed with gusto. They may not be the most dynamic duo to hit the road, but the relationship between Burt and Verona feels touchingly true. Burt is a boy still trying on manhood for size (with a beard for extra emphasis), and though we've seen Krasinski do this before, he seems to have fine-tuned the performance to the point where he could very happily play it for the next two decades. Unlike his character, he's an actor who has found himself. Maya Rudolph is the joy of this picture. Give or take her role in Altman's ""Prairie Home Companion,"" the ""Saturday Night Live"" star hasn't made much impact in movies before now. With her frazzled, freckled face, she's not the glamour girl who would normally be shoe-horned into the romantic lead, but she seizes her chance and runs with it. Mendes brings out a more thoughtful and nuanced presence than the brittle comedienne, and Rudolph makes you consider how rarely we see a real woman at the center of things. Even her occasional tentativeness works for the part. Verona is so fresh and alert, she can't help but doubt herself as they trail from one family disaster to the next and wonder what kind of parents they are going to make. It's an uneven picture about the bumps in the road, and not immune to the odd dramatic shortcut or jocular cheap shot. But it does catch an anxiety that will be acutely familiar to anyone contemplating imminent parenthood, and -- in a beautifully judged cameo by Melanie Lynskey -- the deep anguish of someone who has had that prospect snatched away. More often than not, and where it really counts, ""Away We Go"" hits home. ""Away We Go"" is rated R and runs 98 minutes.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A Chris Brown song called ""Not My Fault"" was recorded three years ago and is not about Rihanna, its producers said. Chris Brown pleaded guilty in an assault case regarding his ex-girlfriend Rihanna. The music appeared online Tuesday, a day after the singer admitted guilt to assaulting Rihanna, his former girlfriend. Brown's record label also said the music was not ""new."" Although Brown accepted a plea deal in which he could avoid jail time, any appearance that he is not remorseful could be damaging, since the judge is not bound by those terms when she sentences him in August. The song, which appeared on YouTube, includes the line ""It's not my fault, right?"" The publicist for the Neptunes, a music producing duo that has worked in the studio with Brown, said the music was a demo recorded three years ago. She said they do not know how the song made its way onto YouTube. Jive Records, which distributes Brown's music, said ""there are no 'new' songs from Chris Brown currently being promoted by Chris or his record label."" ""There are several old demos circulating that are being falsely promoted as new material from Chris,"" a Jive Records statement said. In the song, Brown sings: . ""I picked up the paper and the headline reads, it says 'singer brokenhearted in some satin sheets.' And I'm like, why? We had a hell of a time."" ""When I first met you, I told ya that you'll be safe. In the midst of arguing something, falls to the floor and breaks. You look down and see what you dropped, oh, it's your heart."" ""Shortie's caught up from a long night. She's ready to fall but she's all right. That's just something that can happen when you put it down. She's caught up, it's not my fault, right."" ""You see, her mama called me, really steamed. She said 'My daughter won't eat and she don't sleep. She just cries.' "" Brown was arrested in connection with an altercation that began with an argument with Rihanna inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street in February. Prosecutors agreed to recommend five years of probation and 180 days of community service for Brown in exchange for his guilty plea on one count of assault with the intent of doing great bodily injury.","Chris Brown song ""Not My Fault"" appeared online Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- With record low approval ratings and intense criticism for his handling of the Iraq war, Hurricane Katrina and the economy, the word most used to label George W. Bush's presidency will be ""incompetent,"" historians say. President Bush makes remarks on the presidential transition November 6. ""Right now there is not a lot of good will among historians. Most see him as a combination of many negative factors,"" said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. ""He is seen as incompetent in terms of how he handled domestic and foreign policy. He is seen as pushing for an agenda to the right of the nation and doing so through executive power that ignored the popular will,"" he added. But like so many presidents before him, Bush's reputation could change with time. Harvard University political history scholar Barbara Kellerman said when President-elect Barack Obama takes over in January, people may view Bush in a new light.  Watch Bush address staff about transition of power Â» . ""I think it's possible when people have stopped being as angry at the Bush administration as they are now ... that they will realize that some of this is just ... the luck of the draw.""   Kellerman, author of the book ""Bad Leadership: What It Is, How It Happens, Why It Matters,"" noted that Bush has not had luck on his side for the past eight years. ""He [Bush] has been a quite unlucky president. Certain things happened on his watch that most people don't have to deal with -- a 9/11, a [Hurricane] Katrina, the financial crisis, being three obvious examples,"" she said. ""And yet they happened on his watch. He is being blamed,"" she said. And that fact -- coupled with approval ratings around 27 percent, according to CNN's poll released October 21 -- is in large part why Obama and Democrats won big on November 4. Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian and professor at Rice University, said the country is dealing with a ""lame duck president"" who will most likely face an uphill battle in getting anything passed through Congress before he leaves office. ""We're dealing with an economic meltdown ... We're dealing with two wars. So everything Obama does now is going to be seen as he is the de facto president,"" Brinkley said Thursday. Read Zelizer's take on what Obama should avoid . Historians, beginning to examine Bush's legacy, note that the 43rd president could end up with a better reputation down the road -- something that happened to Harry Truman. At different points in his presidency, Truman earned some of the highest and the lowest public approval ratings in history: 87 percent approval in June 1945  vs. 23 percent approval in January 1952, according to a CNN analysis of polling at the time. Truman, who is often noted for his upset victory over Thomas Dewey in 1948, faced several domestic and foreign policy problems throughout his term in office, which lasted from 1945-1953. Most notably: The Korean War, World War II and later, Cold War relations with an aggressive Soviet Union. ""One of the things that has been conventionally done is to compare George W. Bush to Harry Truman, both of whom had upon leaving office dismal approval ratings and of course as it is well known by now, Harry Truman's reputation has, by virtually every account, not only improved, but I would say escalated nearly to the top of the list of greater American presidents,"" Kellerman added. Another president Bush may be compared to down the road? Ronald Reagan. Prior to leaving office, Reagan faced strong backlash from Republicans and Democrats on opening negotiations with Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev during the Cold War era as well as the handling of the Iran-Contra Affair. ""He was seen as bumbling; he was seen as unintelligent; he was seen as a guy driven by his advisers,"" Zelizer added. ""And now he's being talked about like FDR, one of the great presidents in American history and we have a new look at who he was."" Reagan is often invoked by Republicans in presidential races -- most recently with the campaign of Sen. John McCain -- looking to shore up the conservative base. Bush, meanwhile, who has long defended his decision to invade Iraq as a way to spread democracy, could also see criticism dissipate over time if Iraq becomes a thriving, stable country. ""If you imagine that an Iraq in 10,15 years is actually a vibrant, stable democracy and other countries neighboring it move in that direction ... I think you'd have a strong Bush revisionism,"" Zelizer said. ""How things unfold in coming decades can help repair a battered presidency,"" he added. Kellerman said that while many will credit Bush for taking charge of democracy-spreading, his ""incompetence"" will still be noted. ""The level of incompetence after the initial 'mission accomplished' was so acute that my guess is, even if the decision to invade might be historically justified, the incompetence that succeeded it ... I think that's going to be very difficult to ever alter our negative perception of that.""","Presidential historians weigh in on how history will perceive President Bush .

"(CNN) -- The Tamil Tiger rebels in Sri Lanka said Sunday they have ""decided to silence our guns"" as government forces closed in on their last stronghold. Sri Lanka's defense ministry says this handout photo shows troops with a captured Tamil Tiger craft Thursday. It is not the first time the rebels have called for an end to fighting when backed into a corner by the Sri Lankan military. But should they follow through on their announcement, the decision would potentially end a bloody 25-year civil war in the country. ""This battle has reached its bitter end,"" Selvarasa Pathmanathan, a spokesman for the rebels said in an ""urgent statement"" posted Sunday on Tamilnet.com, a pro-rebel Web site. ""It is our people who are dying now from bombs, shells, illness and hunger. We cannot permit any more harm to befall them. We remain with one last choice -- to remove the last weak excuse of the enemy for killing our people. We have decided to silence our guns,"" he said. Sri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapaksa is expected to announce that ""military operations"" against the Tiger rebels have ended in an address to the nation from Parliament on Tuesday, the government said Sunday. The rebels -- formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) (LTTE) -- have fought for an independent state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka since July 1983. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began. Government forces have trapped the remaining rebels in a small stretch of land in the north of the country -- and possibly thousands of civilians with them, an international aid worker in the country told CNN. The civilians are ""under intense fire"" and ""essentially on their own"" in the area, which the government says contains only rebels, the aid worker said. The Tigers themselves claim 25,000 civilians are dead or dying, a rebel identified as Col. Soosai said in a statement on Tamilnet.com. Independent confirmation was not possible since media are not allowed into the area. Reports indicated fighting had intensified as troops scrambled to clear a remaining 1.2 square kilometers before the government could announce that military operations had ended. The army destroyed six Tamil Tiger boats and killed 70 rebels in a lagoon on the western edge of a no-fire zone early Sunday, Sri Lanka's Media Center for National Security said. Sri Lanka's prime minister warned Saturday that his country ""stands on the brink,"" as its soldiers cornered Tamil Tiger fighters in an assault which the United Nations fears is trapping more than 50,000 civilians on a small plot of coastal land. Government troops seized the last remaining coastal stretch under the control of Tamil Tiger rebels, the Ministry of Defense said Saturday. The seizure marks the total capture of coastline territory previously controlled by the rebels, it said, after army divisions advanced from the north and south to link up. An international aid worker said the United Nations was expecting about 20,000 of them to arrive in refugee camps Sunday. There were no medical services in the no-fire zone, the aid worker said.  Watch aid agencies fear for Sri Lanka Â» . The Media Center for National Security claims 50,097 have come out of battle zones. Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa returned from Amman, Jordan, on Sunday. Rajapaksa was attending a summit of developing nations and the World Economic Forum. In an address to the summit in Amman on Saturday, Rajapaksa said the Sri Lankan armed forces had defeated the rebels. ""I will be going back to my country Sri Lanka that has been totally freed from the barbaric acts of terrorism of the LTTE. This freedom comes after 30 long years,"" Rajapaksa said. Journalist Iqbal Athas contributed to this report.","Soldiers have cornered rebels in assault that has trapped 50,000-plus civilians .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- For someone who claims to be incredibly laid back, Jason Mraz is certainly piling up the accomplishments. Jason Mraz was recently honored with a songwriting award for his work, which includes the hit ""I'm Yours."" The singer-songwriter was the recipient of the Hal David Starlight Award at last week's Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee ceremony in New York. The honor typically goes to newcomers striking a chord in the music industry. Or, as Mraz puts it, ""I hope it has something to do with their savvy freshness."" Mraz, who turned 32 this week and took his parents to the celebratory dinner at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square June 18, says he feels great about the honor. ""I never thought my songs would escape my bedroom,"" he said. ""To have the music shared all around the world, and to be acknowledged by communities like this ... it's inspiring."" Mraz's 2008 album ""We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things"" has been a runaway success, with more than 2.5 million copies sold worldwide. It also led to three Grammy nominations, including song of the year and best male pop vocal performance for the reggae-inflected hit ""I'm Yours."" Mraz (whose name reflects his family's Czech heritage) hits the festival circuit overseas before kicking off his stateside ""Gratitude CafÃ© Tour"" July 25. The tour's quirky title was inspired by a wholesome San Francisco, California, restaurant Mraz loves. A fan of maintaining a diet of predominantly raw foods, Mraz is also a farmer of sorts: He owns an avocado farm in his home city of San Diego, California. He's also a juggler, a skill Mraz taught himself during the downtime that comes with touring.  Watch the multitalented Mraz perform Â» . Mraz shared tales of his avocado farm, as well as what it's like to get the cold shoulder from Simon Cowell, when he sat down with CNN recently. CNN: So, you live on an avocado farm. What's that like? Jason Mraz: It's fantastic. Anytime you're harvesting something in your yard -- whether you have a small herb garden or I've got avocados, and now we have a solar system so we're also harvesting sun energy, which is great -- for me that's when I became an environmentalist. I was like, ""Wait a second. This is my environment. This is my piece of the Earth that I'm responsible for."" Yes, the trees give me avocado and fruit that we sell and we eat tons of, but I feel like I have a role to play back to that, too. So it's cool. CNN: So if you're at home, daily how many avocados would you eat? Mraz: At least two. Sometimes three or four. CNN: So you must have very nice oily skin. Mraz: I do, thank you. It's the avocado. I just lather it on. CNN: Do you really? Mraz: I do. Yeah, why not? I've got tons of them! CNN: Do you cook? Mraz: I prepare. There's not much cooking in our household. We do a lot of raw food so it's more about putting the right ingredients together to create something scrumptious. See Mraz's chocomole recipe . CNN: When eating healthy is so important to you, how difficult is that to maintain when you're traveling around the world so much? Mraz: Well, I bring tons of backup supplies with me. CNN: How did you like performing on the ""American Idol"" final? (Mraz performed ""I'm Yours"" with contestants Anoop Desai and Alexis Grace.) Mraz: I loved it. It was such a great event. And I have compassion for every one of those kids that dares audition. I wasn't a contestant. I was just there to sing, and when I saw Simon at the end of that panel I freaked out. I was like, ""What does he think?"" And then I had to stop myself and say ""Dude, you're not a contestant."" He's aloof. But I watched during the rest of the night and he did it to all the acts. That's just his way. CNN: Do you think you could hack it as an ""American Idol"" contestant? Mraz: It is really tough. I watch what those guys do backstage between songs and their weekly schedule is super intense -- to learn new songs, to shoot videos, to learn dance moves and all this. They actually go through a pretty amazing transformation during the course of that show. I just don't know that I could commit myself to something like that. I'm a little more laid back. And some days if I can't show up to work, I don't show up to work. And I love that (laughs). CNN: Were you surprised by the success of ""I'm Yours""? Mraz: Very surprised. There's something simple about it ... like a nursery rhyme. I thought it was so playful. I never expected the world to really grab it and run with it the way they have. CNN: Can you talk me through how you went about writing that song? Where were you? What were you doing? Mraz: I was at home. It was a sunny afternoon. And just as any afternoon where I play music, I was playing on an electric guitar, just chugging around, feeling a little reggae in me you know, and the melody and the words just started to pop out rather quickly and so I recorded it rather quickly. And the whole process only took about a half an hour. CNN: You're about to go overseas to play various festivals. Is there anywhere you'll be going for the first time? Mraz: This year we're going to explore South America, which I've visited as a tourist, but I've never taken my music down there. I hear the crowds turn up in masses, so I really want to see what that's like. I love getting to bounce around and explore so much. I love Scandinavia. I love Spain. It's so mystical and romantic, yet it's gritty. CNN: Do you speak Spanish? Mraz: No, but I have the Rosetta Stone. I have begun my level one training.","Jason Mraz recently honored with songwriters award .

"(CNN) -- Cleanup efforts unfolded Monday in Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, after torrential monsoon rain over the weekend killed dozens, cut power to 15 million and broke a 32-year record. Pakistanis push a stranded auto-rickshaw along a flooded street  in Karachi on Sunday. Officials combed the city looking for bodies. The health department confirmed 32 deaths and said it received reports of more. ""Most of them are either from drowning or they were deaths when the walls or roofs of their houses collapses,"" said Dr. A.D. Sajnani of the health department. ""The entire city is disrupted,"" said Muhammad Aly Balagamwala, a Karachi businessman. ""Most places lost power for 28 to 30 hours, and some are still without power. The rain flooded offices. We lost water. Everything is shut down."" Many residents took to the streets to protest the massive power outage in the southern city. They threw rocks at the offices of the power company and burned tires. ""I guess there comes a point you just snap and you can't take it anymore,"" Balagamwala said. ""To the credit of the government, a lot of cleanup work has been done since last night."" The rain began Friday night, and by Sunday the city had received almost 9 inches (22.9 cm), the most since 1977, said Mayor Syed Mustafa Kamal. Storm drains overflowed, water-logging streets and alleyways. Monsoon rains sweep across the subcontinent from June to September. While they bring much-needed relief to often-parched farmlands, they also leave a trail of landslides, home collapses and floods that sometimes claim dozens of lives.","By Sunday, Karachi had received almost 9 inches (22.9 cm) of rain, mayor says .

"(CNN) -- Former Philippine President Corazon Aquino, whose ""People Power"" movement pushed out longtime strongman Ferdinand Marcos less than three years after her husband's assassination, has died at age 76, her family announced Saturday. ""She was the agent of change in Philippine democracy,"" said Ray Donato, the nation's consul-general in Atlanta. Aquino, the first woman to lead the Philippines, had been battling colon cancer since March 2008 and died of cardio-respiratory arrest at 3:18 a.m. Saturday (3:18 p.m. Friday ET), said Mai Mislang, a spokeswoman for her son, Philippine Sen. Benigno Aquino III. Funeral arrangements were being set up, Mislang said.  Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has also announced a 10-day mourning period for the former president, said Ray Donato, the country's consul-general in Atlanta. ""She was the agent of change in Philippine democracy, and almost all the Filipinos I know revered her during her presidency,"" Donato said. Aquino had been born into a wealthy family and was educated in the United States. She had not been involved in politics before her husband, opposition leader Benigno ""Ninoy"" Aquino Jr., was gunned down at Manila's airport in August 1983 as he returned from exile. The political novice took over the leadership of her husband's movement after his death and challenged Marcos in a 1986 election, making a yellow dress her trademark and bolstered by the support of the country's Roman Catholic churches. Marcos had been backed by the United States, the former colonial power in the Philippines, for two decades as a stalwart anti-communist. He and his wife Imelda were friends of then-President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy. But widespread allegations of electoral fraud and a mutiny by the country's military led the Reagan administration to withdraw its support, and Marcos went into exile in Hawaii. Aquino took office in a country with a $28 billion debt, widespread poverty and a persistent Marxist insurgency. She put in place a U.S.-style constitution that limited presidents to a single six-year term and survived seven coup attempts -- including one that was supressed with American help. She also oversaw the closure of the major U.S. military bases in the country before leaving office in 1992. The bases had been a bulwark of American power in the Pacific since the early 1900s and employed nearly 80,000 Filipinos, but Aquino's opponents argued the country was too dependent on the United States. Aquino announced in 1990 that it was time to begin negotiating the ""orderly withdrawal"" of U.S. forces.","NEW: Funeral arrangements are being set up, spokeswoman says .

"(CNN) -- Shoulder-launched anti-tank weapons purchased by Venezuela have ended up in the hands of guerrillas, Colombian Vice President Francisco Santos said. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro talks on the phone with President Hugo Chavez in Caracas Monday. In an interview with Caracol Radio Monday, Santos addressed local reports of anti-tank weapons manufactured in Sweden being seized from members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and traced to Venezuela. ""This is not the first time that this happens,"" Santos said. ""In several operations in which we have recovered weapons from the FARC, we have found powerful munitions and powerful equipment, including anti-tank weapons, from a European country that sold them to Venezuela and that turned up in the hands of the FARC."" The weapons have been identified as AT4 shoulder-fired rockets manufactured by Saab Bofors Dynamics in Sweden, according to Jane's Defence Weekly. They were seized in 2008 from a guerrilla base, the Colombian magazine Semana reported. Jan-Erik Lovgren, the Swedish official who oversees weapon exports, told Radio Sweden on Monday that his country stopped selling weapons to Venezuela in 2006. Venezuela on Monday denied allegations that they gave the weapons to the guerrilla group. ""To me it seems that this is a new attack against our government based on lies,"" Venezuelan Minister of the Interior and Justice Tareck El Aissami said at a news conference Monday. ""We absolutely deny that our government or our institutions are providing assistance to criminal and terrorist organizations,"" El Aissami told reporters.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A fan of English football club Arsenal has been injured after the bus he and other supporters were traveling in was ambushed before the sides' Champions League clash in Rome, Wednesday night. Winners: Arsenal beat Roma 7-6 on penalties after one of their fans was injured before the game. A spokesman from the British Embassy in Rome told CNN the fan was understood to have suffered wounds to the leg -- but it was unsure if he had been stabbed or injured by broken glass. The spokesman said the mini bus, which was not an official tour bus, became lost near the stadium and ""ended up at the wrong part of the ground"". Roma fans nearby set about attacking the bus, the spokesman said. ""They smashed the windows and then one of them managed to get on the bus. This appears to be where the injury occurred,"" he said. Police were quick to arrive and the bus managed to move on to safety, where the fan was treated for the wound, he said. The visiting side went on to win the tie 7-6 on penalties after Roma won the game 1-0, leaving the two-match tie level 1-1 on aggregate. Arsenal had distributed a booklet to its estimated 3,500 traveling fans warning that they were ""at risk"" if they traveled alone to the Stadio Olimpico. The booklet warned supporters to stay clear of areas that were known gathering points of Roma's ""Ultra"" fans -- a group known for creating conflict with rival supporters. Last month ten football fans were shot dead in the south of Nigeria on the way to support their team. The victims were traveling supporters of the Ocean Boys Football Club in Nigeria. Also in February, one fan was killed and at least 40 more injured when violence broke out at football matches across Brazil. In 2007, Manchester United fans were injured after violence in two separate incidents with Roma fans when the teams met in Rome. In 2003 five England fans suffered gunshot wounds during a violent incident in Zurich, Switzerland, before the side played a Euro 2004 qualifier with Liechtenstein.","Fan injured during ambush on bus before Champions League game in Rome .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Olga A. Mendez, a ground-breaking Puerto Rican politician from New York City, has died after a long battle with cancer, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced. Mendez, widely reported to be the first Puerto Rican woman elected to a state legislature in the mainland United States, was 84. ""Olga's election to the state Senate as its first Puerto Rican woman was a tremendous symbol of hope for a community that now had a seat at the table,"" Bloomberg said in a release Wednesday. ""But Olga's life was an inspiration to countless others, because the doors she bravely pushed opened stayed open for everyone else."" Mendez served in the New York state Senate 13 consecutive terms, from 1978 until being defeated in 2004. A long-time Democrat, she had switched to the Republican Party in 2002 and failed to win re-election to her heavily Democratic 28th district, which included East Harlem and parts of the Bronx. ""Mendez was brash, bold and aggressive because she had to be,"" New York's El Diario newspaper said Thursday. ""She cut her teeth in the Senate and became a battle-ready politician. And she balanced what few politicians were able to do well -- an on-the-ground constituency services with the ability to achieve critical legislative negotiations. This, in a Senate that was controlled by Republicans during the entire 26 years she served."" Bloomberg noted Mendez's bipartisanship. ""When I first entered public service eight years ago, Olga sat me down and impressed upon me -- in her inimitable way -- the importance of reaching across partisan lines to do what's right for your constituents,"" the mayor said. ""That's a lesson I carry with me every day."" El Diario noted that ""Mendez successfully fought for an increase in the state's minimum wage, ushered in legislation that provided basic rights to migrant farm workers and secured funding for senior citizen centers. She also fought for resources for early childhood development and gained bipartisan support for affordable housing and economic development initiatives in her district."" Born in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, Mendez moved to the Mainland U.S. after receiving a bachelor's degree from the Universidad de Puerto Rico in 1950. She received a master's degree in psychology from the Teacher's College at Columbia University in 1960 and a doctorate's in educational psychology from Yeshiva University in 1975. An early widow, she had no children. Mendez underwent surgery for breast cancer in 1993. ""Olga didn't recoil from public life or attempt to hide her condition,"" Bloomberg said. ""Instead, she shared her story and her struggle with others.""","Mendez said to be first Puerto Rican woman elected to a state legislature in U.S.

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- An Al Qaeda-linked militant group waging war against Somalia's fragile government is becoming an increasing threat to Western ally Kenya and could potentially destabilize the region with dire consequences for global security, officials and analysts warn. Al-Shabab fighters count their bullets in neighborhood of Mogadishu. Al-Shabaab, one of the strongest Islamic militias battling for control of Mogadishu, has gained ground in recent weeks, according to officials, and has started to flex its muscles beyond Somalia's border with terror strikes, kidnappings and recruitment drives. They warn that unless the world takes action the group, which wants to impose an extreme type of Islamic sharia law, could extend its grip across parts of East Africa to gain control of a region that flanks busy shipping routes already plagued by Somali pirates . Appeals by Somalia's government for international help to unpick its long-running civil conflict have escalated Al-Shabaad's threats with the group behind warnings of an attack on the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. And, say experts, the group is being backed by foreign fighters -- some said to have links to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network -- a situation that draws direct comparisons with the group's influence in pre-9/11 Afghanistan. ""Al-Shabaab is a threat to the whole world,"" Somali Information Minister Farhan Ali Mohamoud told CNN. ""First to Somalia, to the neighborhood, and to everywhere they have disagreed with.""  Watch more on Somalian threat Â» . Mohamoud, whose transitional government has largely failed in its long-term goal of reconciling Somalia's militias, concedes Al-Shabaab is making major gains on his administration and says the global community must act to prevent their threat escalating. ""Somalia's problems are not for Somalia alone to solve. Not only for the African Union to solve. It is a global and regional issue. We are very appreciative that the international community understands that, but they need to act now, rather than later."" ""The issue is not Somalis taking over from other Somalis. But the issue is foreign jihadists imposing their ideas into the region. So Somalia can be a launching pad for a greater and wider jihadist issue."" Kenyan government spokesman Alfred Mutua told CNN his country did not yet fear direct attacks from Al-Shabaab but said it was becoming increasingly alarmed about its activities and its links to foreign networks. Despite the concerns, Mutua said the problem was nothing new and while his country struggled to exert control over its porous border with Somalia, it was taking steps to limit the danger. But he warned the threat was not limited to Kenya and could have global reach. ""We do believe that Al-Shabaab poses a threat, not only to Kenya, but to all neighboring countries such as Ethiopia and Eritrea,"" he said. ""It is not just a problem that we foresee in Kenya, just because we are neighbors to them, it is a problem that we foresee that may occur to a lot of countries and also poses a threat to outside even this region,"" he added. ""Our concern is not limited to Al-Shabaab. We know that Al-Shabaab are not able to do it without foreign intervention in terms of money and weapons that they are getting from other countries."" Ernst Jan Hogendoorn, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, told CNN that while Al-Shabaab had whipped up concerns with headline grabbing acts such as the recent kidnap of two French citizens in Mogadishu and three aid workers on the Kenyan side of the border, countries such as Kenya should pay heed. ""I think that Kenya could do a much better job. There is always the possibility that someone could sneak across the border and launch an attack against a soft target. Obviously Kenya has been the target of attacks in the past that are very, very challenging to prevent."" But, says Hogendoorn, with an African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia proving largely ineffective, and Ethiopian military presence withdrawn in January ahead of an Al-Shabaab push, Kenyan military involvement was unlikely to offer any quick fix. ""The problem is once [Kenyan troops] are on the ground they open themselves up to guerrilla style attacks and suicide attacks that could lead to significant loss in life.""","Experts, officials warn of growing threat from Somali militant group .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- International troops in Afghanistan endured another deadly attack Tuesday, a day after 10 NATO-led troops were killed in that country. The body of a U.S. soldier killed in Afghanistan arrives in the United States on Monday. A U.S. coalition service member ""died as a result of injuries"" on Tuesday afternoon in a roadside bombing attack on a convoy in western Afghanistan, the U.S. military said. This follows 10 NATO-led deaths on Monday, the highest single-day total in Afghanistan in nearly a year, according to NATO and U.S.-led coalition numbers. Seven Americans, two Canadians and one Briton died in four separate incidents Monday. On August 18, 2008, 10 French soldiers were killed when about 100 insurgents attacked a patrol in Kabul Province, and a British soldier was killed in southern Afghanistan when insurgents attacked a patrol with a roadside bomb. A month before that, 10 American troops were killed in two separate incidents on July 13, 2008. The latest deaths came as U.S. troops cranked up their fight against the Taliban, a push that includes a major Marine-led offensive against the militants in the southern province of Helmand. Roadside bombs Monday killed four Americans in the northern province of Kunduz and two in southern Afghanistan, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said. A seventh American died in an insurgent attack in eastern Afghanistan, ISAF confirmed. Two Canadian air crew members and a British soldier were killed when a helicopter crashed during takeoff in Zabul province, the Canadian and British defense ministries said.","U.S. soldier killed in roadside bombing on a convoy in western Afghanistan .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A 90-year-old Holocaust survivor was found strangled Thursday in his Upper East Side apartment, a spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner said Friday. Felix Brinkmann dances at a 2008 party marking his 90th birthday. Felix Brinkmann, a native of Latvia,  escaped death for a year while he was in the Nazis' Mauthausen, Ebensee and Auschwitz concentration camps. Five times he had been slated for the gas chambers, but each time he used his fluency in German to talk his way out. After the war ended, he was stunned to discover that his wife, who had also been shipped to Auschwitz, was alive and well in Poland. The Brinkmanns immigrated to America, where Felix spent years in the bar and nightclub business, co-founding in 1971 Adam's Apple disco in Manhattan. In recent years, he had served as the real estate manager of a mixed-use building in the Bronx, working ""seven days a week, without fail,"" said his son Rick Brinkman, who spells his last name differently than his father. On Thursday, the building's superintendent grew concerned when Brinkmann did not show up to work. He notified Brinkmann's son and received permission to enter the father's apartment, where he had lived alone since his wife died last year. Brinkmann's body was found lying face down in his bedroom, his hands bound, his body showing blunt-force trauma wounds, police said. Brinkmann's blue 2009 Honda Civic may have been stolen and a safe in his apartment tampered with, police said. A police spokesman said authorities were looking for ""a man and a woman"" in connection with the homicide. Rick Brinkman speculated that the killing was random in nature.

"(CNN) -- Severe turbulence shook a Continental Airlines flight Monday, injuring dozens of passengers and forcing the aircraft to divert to Miami, Florida, according to the airline and a fire official. Oxygen masks hang from a damaged part of the plane Monday, in a photo by passenger Camila Machado. There were 168 passengers and 11 crew members on Flight 128, which was heading from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Houston, Texas, according to a statement from Continental Airlines. ""I've never seen turbulence like that, so I really thought we wouldn't make it,"" passenger Giovani Loss told CNN affiliate WSVN-TV. Loss, who is originally from Brazil, said he is a lawyer in the United States and frequently travels between the two countries. He said passengers were afraid the turbulence may have been the result of mechanical problems with the plane. ""People [were] screaming, then there was a huge silence for like 30 minutes,"" Loss said. Ambulances and other vehicles were lined up on the runway to treat and transport the injured passengers when the plane landed at Miami International Airport at 5:35 a.m.  Watch passengers describe what happened Â» . ""People that weren't seat belted in flew up and hit the ceilings,"" passenger John Norwood told WSVN. ""So their faces, their heads hit the plastics and broke all the plastics up top."" Continental said seven passengers were transported to nearby hospitals, and approximately 28 other passengers were treated at the scene. Lt. Elkin Sierra of the Miami-Dade Fire Department said 26 passengers were injured, including four seriously. The Boeing 767-200 hit turbulence about 50 miles north of the Dominican Republic at about 38,000 feet, according to an official with the Federal Aviation Administration. It landed in Miami an hour later with its seat belt signs illuminated, the airline said. Many of the passengers said they did not hear any warning before the turbulence hit. Injuries received included bumps, bruises, neck pain and back pain, Sierra said. Passengers said they saw several people bleeding from their heads, including one woman who sustained a serious gash to her head. The flight is scheduled to depart Miami for Houston later in the morning, according to Continental's Web site. It had been scheduled to arrive in Houston at 6 a.m. local time.","Airliner hits turbulence, is forced to divert to Miami, Florida .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- An Army staff sergeant will posthumously receive the Medal of Honor after he sacrificed his own life in an effort to save another soldier in Afghanistan, the White House said Friday. By acts of ""immeasurable courage,"" Staff Sgt. Jared Monti earned the Medal of Honor, the White House said. Staff Sgt. Jared Monti will receive the medal, the nation's highest military honor, on September 17 for his actions in combat, the White House said in a statement. His parents, Paul and Janet Monti, ""will join the president at the White House to commemorate their son's example of selfless service and sacrifice."" Monti, of Raynham, Massachusetts, died June 21, 2006, while deployed with the 10th Mountain Division, according to a Web site set up by family and friends to announce a scholarship in his honor. He was 31 when he died. Monti's reconnaissance team occupied a surveillance position when they were attacked near Gowardesh, Afghanistan, and he was killed by enemy fire, the Web site says. The White House statement said Monti ""displayed immeasurable courage and uncommon valor -- eventually sacrificing his own life in an effort to save his comrade,"" but did not provide details of his actions. Monti's military decorations already included the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, five Army Commendation Medals, four Army Achievement Medals, three Good Conduct Medals and three National Defense Service Medals, the White House statement said. He is survived by his parents, his sister and brother and a niece. Monti was posthumously promoted to sergeant first class. The Medal of Honor is awarded to U.S. soldiers who distinguish themselves with ""gallantry above and beyond the call of duty,"" the White House said.

"(CNN)  -- The murder of rapper Dolla reverberated throughout the music industry on Tuesday as police sought a motive for the brazen killing. Rap artist Dolla was known as a nice guy who survived a rough childhood. The aspiring Southern hip-hop artist, whose real name was Roderick Anthony Burton II, was gunned down in the busy parking lot of the upscale Beverly Center mall in Los Angeles, California, on Monday afternoon. Police later arrested Aubrey Louis Berry, 23, at Los Angeles International Airport, a Los Angeles Police statement said. No other details were given about Berry. The 21-year-old rapper was based in Atlanta, Georgia. He was in Los Angeles to work on his debut album. Those who knew him said that despite coming from a rough background, Burton was extremely gracious and polite. ""Everything with Dolla was 'please' and 'thank you,' "" said Ant Rich, manager of A&R for Jive Records, who discovered the rapper for the label when Burton was 17 and helped sign him a year later. ""The streets did not define him at all. He was bigger than that."" Dolla was a protÃ©gÃ© of singer Akon, who collaborated with him on his first single, ""Who the F--- is That?"" which also featured another high-profile artist, T-Pain. Another Dolla song, ""Feelin' Myself,"" appeared on the soundtrack to the 2006 movie ""Step Up."" According to his official MySpace page, Dolla was born in Chicago, Illinois, and his family relocated to Los Angeles soon after. He was 5 years old when he and his older sister, Divinity, witnessed their father committing suicide. After that incident, their mother moved the family to Atlanta, according to his biography. The Burton family released the following statement on Tuesday: . ""First and foremost we, the family, would like to thank everyone for all their kind thoughts and prayers. Furthermore, the family would like to note that rumored details of the shooting on popular Web/blog sites are false. ""Due to the circumstances of the situation, no other information will be released at this time. We are grateful for your continuous support and would be very appreciative if we could mourn this loss in private. ""Additionally, information released before and after this official statement are not confirmed nor should they be considered accurate."" Rich said Dolla, who also did some modeling for P. Diddy's Sean John label, loved his family deeply. He was the guy with the great smile who would do things like offer to pick up the bill after a meeting with music executives, Rich said. ""You would tell him 'Look Dolla, you don't have to do that because we get reimbursed for this' and he would say 'No, no you got it last time, let me,' "" Rich said. ""The world lost a really good kid and he had the biggest heart."" DeAngelo Jones books talent for BET and got to know Dolla after he performed at the network's ""Spring Bling"" event last year. He said the artist was humbled and grateful for the success he was starting to find in the industry. ""That energy was what drew me to him,"" said Jones, who stayed in touch with Dolla after the show and often ran into him at other events. ""A lot of times there are negative associations that go along with being a rapper, but he was not at all what the image of a rapper is portrayed to be."" Jones said he was at the Beverly Center only a short time before the shooting occurred. Jones said it was unfortunate that Dolla's slaying is yet another incident that will link hip-hop with violence. ""Hip-hop gets such a bad rap, ever since the deaths of Biggie and Tupac,"" Jones said. ""[Dolla] just wanted to be successful, help other people and do the right thing. What's so hard for me is to see where his life was heading, because he was definitely on the right course."" Jerry Barrow, senior editor for The Urban Daily, a publication devoted to African-Americans in pop culture, noted that it was unfortunate that Dolla is finding mainstream recognition posthumously. ""With his modeling and his music, he did more before the age of 20 than many people do,"" Barrow said. ""It's a shame that this is how many people are now discovering him and his music."" Rashan Ali, a disc jockey with Atlanta's Hot 107.9 radio station, said the city has a thriving hip-hop community. Her station, which plays hip-hop, often has its lobby filled with aspiring artists trying to get their music heard. With the success of Atlanta-based artists like rappers T.I., Outkast, and Young Jeezy, more and more young people are drawn to the area to try and make the connections that will find them fame, Ali said. That Dolla was killed while pursuing his craft is especially sad, she said. ""[Dolla] was minding his business, in Los Angeles trying to record his music and this happens,"" Ali said. ""It's horrific and now a mother has to bury her child. It's senseless.""","Those who knew rapper Dolla mourn his loss .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The United States almost provided one of football's biggest upsets when they were narrowly beaten by Brazil in the final of the Confederations Cup in South Africa. The U.S. players cut dejected figures after their Confederations Cup final defeat to Brazil . Goals from Clint Dempsey and captain Landon Donovan had given the U.S. a 2-0 lead at half-time, before Luis Fabiano struck twice after the break and Lucio headed home the winner six minutes before the final whistle to give Brazil the title. While the presence of the U.S. in the final reflects the significant progress made since the country hosted the World Cup in 1994, it will undoubtedly raise expectation levels for the 2010 World Cup. Central to this is whether the current crop of players in coach Bob Bradley's squad possess the credentials to make the next step and become serious challengers to the European and South American elite. World Soccer magazine columnist and U.S. Soccer expert Paul Gardner felt that while the exploits of the national team were impressive, the country is still some way short of fulfilling their potential on the world stage. ""The way the tournament went it really opened up for the U.S. and certainly the progress made is there for all to see, particularly in the victory over Spain who had been on an good run up until that point,"" Gardner told CNN. ""Undoubtedly things have moved on a great deal since the World Cup was staged here in 1994, but if you look at the bigger picture there is perhaps a slight sense of underachievement because of the huge resources available. ""In terms of organization, facilities and sheer participation numbers the U.S. has massive potential which has not quite yet been matched by what has happened at national level."" Does the Hispanic community hold the key for the future of U.S. football? Sound Off here. Crucially Gardner believes that for the U.S. to shake the tag of nearly men there must be a stronger emphasis placed on tapping into the abundance of talent provided within the country's Hispanic population. ""The experience that players have gained from playing in Europe has improved the players and Bob Bradley has molded a side which can hold it's own against some of the bigger nations,"" Gardner explained. ""But for the U.S. to become a real force then it must begin to tap into the quality of talent available in the Hispanic community which can be nurtured to take the game to the next level. ""The Major Soccer League has yet to really embrace this idea and I think that needs to change in the first instance to enable the development of players capable of winning matches at the very top. ""MLS side Houston Dynamo is a case in point. Something like 50 percent of their support is Hispanic, 90 percent of their youth talent is Hispanic but have only have a few Hispanic players in the team. ""And that extends to the national team. The composition of the side at the moment is very much the team that Bob Bradley and Bruce Arena built and they -- like a number of MLS coaches -- have gone for players they can trust and rely on. ""The Hispanic players have the game in their blood and their skill and technical levels need to be embraced rather than maybe having a dependence on players who fit a specific system."" For Gardner, at least, it seems that development of the Hispanic talent must therefore become a keystone policy for the U.S. Soccer Federation to put them into the bracket of serious World Cup contenders in years to come. But what of their chances at next year's World Cup in South Africa? He added: ""The U.S. should not get carried way with their performance at the Confederations Cup and the players should not look beyond getting past the group stages in South Africa. ""A good run in Japan and South Korea in 2002 was followed by elimination before the knockout phase in Germany 2006 so they need to be cautious. ""Winning the World Cup will probably be beyond the U.S. next year. Bradley will make them a difficult team to beat, and I don't think anyone will get an easy game against them so it will be interesting to see how they do.""","U.S. national team have made progress since hosting the World Cup in 1994 .

"(CNN)  -- Richard Strandlof said he survived the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon. He said he survived again when a roadside bomb went off in Iraq killing four fellow Marines. He'd point to his head and tell people he had a metal plate, collateral damage from the explosion. Richard Strandlof says he didn't mean to cause harm when he lied about being a military veteran. Crowds ate up his story. He canvassed Colorado appearing at the sides of politicians. Inspiring and seemingly authentic, he spoke on behalf of veterans at the state Capitol. It turns out the whole thing was a lie. He wasn't at the Pentagon. He was never a Marine. He never served his country. He never graduated from the Naval Academy. He claimed his name was Rick Duncan. He formed a group called the Colorado Veterans Alliance, and the FBI is now investigating whether he embezzled money as a result.  Watch Strandlof defend himself Â» . Where was he on 9/11, the day he said he witnessed heroism firsthand? ""I was in San Jose, California, watching it in horror on TV with a few other people,"" Strandlof told CNN's Anderson Cooper. He was at a homeless shelter at the time. Strandlof denies being a pathological liar. He says he suffered from ""some severely underdiagnosed mental illness"" and that he got caught up in the moment around ""people who are passionate and loved what they did."" He told CNN he had put on a ""production, which I'm sorry for."" ""Hopefully the people that I hurt can in some way gain closure from that, and I myself don't know what I can do short of leaving them alone and not being in their lives, to make that happen,"" Strandlof said. He said he's not sure exactly how he's hurt people. ""It's not for me to say, and time will tell,"" he said. Hal Bidlack, a former Air Force lieutenant colonel, is one of those people. He ran for Congress as a Democrat and had Strandlof appear with him. Bidlack isn't too happy. ""Once one lie fell apart, the whole series of things ... just cascaded into an ocean of lies,"" he said. Bidlack was at the Pentagon when it came under attack on September 11, 2001. He now realizes that Strandlof stole portions of his own story. ""Now that we know he's a lying fraud,"" Bidlack said, ""I think he was just parroting my own story back to me."" ""There are an awful lot of things that he kept straight to try to fool an awful lot of people for an awful long time."" Doug Sterner has catalogued hundreds of people claiming to be military veterans who never served in the military. He says it's typical for those perpetuating the hoaxes to claim mental illness. ""I don't buy that,"" Sterner said. ""What he was doing was looking for a cause to promote himself. I see this repeatedly. I've had a hundred cases just this year like Rick Strandlof's. ... What they're doing is building a kingdom of self and feeding their own ego."" Sterner has pushed for a federal database listing the names and citations of all decorated military veterans to help put an end to such cases. He said Strandlof has robbed true veterans of their veracity. ""Doing good does not take away from the bad that he did,"" he said. ""Because of Rick Strandlof, the next global war on terrorism veteran that speaks in a school or talks to the media or gets involved in politics is going to be questioned."" According to the Denver Post, Strandlof came to authorities' attention first in 1997, when he was sentenced to five years on forgery and bad-check charges. With the FBI now investigating him for fraud, he told CNN he's innocent. ""We did not take money to use on non-veterans projects. I did not enrich myself on this. I did not gain any money from this,"" he said. That's not the point, said Sterner. ""The one thing he robbed from every veteran that comes out now is credibility.""

"(CNN) -- When Navy snipers rescued an American cargo-ship captain last month from Somali pirates, it sounded like something from a movie. This shooting game by Games2Win.com lets players try to rescue a ship captain from Somali pirates. But in today's instant-gratification culture, there's no need to wait for Hollywood to re-enact that dramatic high-seas story. Video game developers are already on the case. Online gaming site Games2Win launched ""Saving Captain Phillips,"" a simple, two-dimensional shooting game, within nine days of the actual rescue. Not to be outdone, Kuma Games followed soon afterwards with ""Somali Showdown: Pirates on the High Seas,"" a PC multiplayer action game that puts players in the middle of a pirate attack on a cargo ship -- and even lets them become one of the pirates. These are just several of many online and cell-phone games based on recent news events. ""Hero on the Hudson,"" a primitive Flash game, lets people pretend they're pilot Chesley Sullenberger and navigate a plummeting airliner to a safe water landing. A successful attempt brings applause, while a botched landing results in a sinking plane, accompanied by ominous gurgling sounds. ""Baseball Juiced,"" launched last month with a social message and already played 1.4 million times online, forces batters to pick between using steroids or working out in a gym. In ""Swinefighter,"" gamers seek to save the world from the spread of swine flu. And ""Trillion Dollar Bailout"" lets players try to boost the economy by awarding government cash to shady corporate fat-cats or struggling homeowners (well, duh). Such topical, and satirical, games speak to our need for a light-hearted break from serious news, said DigitalTrends.com publisher Scott Steinberg. ""So many events in the news are devastating,"" he said. ""These games are a fun escape. They're good for a laugh, and nobody gets hurt -- unlike in the real world."" The idea to publish games based on news events was inspired in part by the success of viral videos such as JibJab's ""This Land,"" an animated online parody that became an instant sensation during the 2004 presidential election season, said David Williams, who heads up the Nickelodeon Kids and Family Games Group. ""It went around the world like wildfire,"" said Williams, whose group runs Addicting Games, a teen gaming site that he said had 11.7 million unique users last month. The success of ""This Land"" signaled that people who got a kick from watching a topical video spoof online might just as easily spend a few minutes playing a similar game. Some early examples included ""Cheney's Fury,"" inspired by the former U.S. vice president's 2006 hunting mishap, and the ""Zidane Head Butt Game,"" which invited players to relive the startling 2006 World Cup moment in which French soccer player Zinedine Zidane went after an Italian player head first. As several global leaders have discovered, almost any embarrassing episode can be turned into a video game. Last December's incident at a Baghdad news conference, at which an Iraqi journalist hurled his shoes at then-U.S. President George W. Bush, inspired several games. Out of the United Kingdom came one hastily-published version, ""Sock and Awe,"" which encouraged players to throw shoes at Bush. As of this week, sockandawe.com reports that more than 94 million virtual size-10 shoes have walloped the former leader of the free world. And as if viral videos of his dozing off at a Group of Seven news conference in February weren't embarrassing enough, former Japanese Finance Minister Shoichi Nakagawa soon had a game to remind him of his slumber blunder. Translated by a spokesman for the Japanese developer LiveWare Inc. as ""Doze off while answering question!,"" the Flash game for mobile phones challenges players to keep the minister awake long enough to answer reporters. Gamers win points by having Nakagawa answer journalists' questions on time, but the game ends if the minister falls asleep while being asked a question. More recently, Cellufun, a New York-based company that fosters mobile communities, launched ""Made Off,"" a game that invites online players to outscam businessman Bernard Madoff, who pleaded guilty to defrauding thousands of investors. ""Think you've got what it takes to build a better Ponzi scheme than Bernie?"" the site asks. ""Always wanted to rob, cheat and steal from innocent investors? Well now's your chance! ... Play as a slimy Fund Manager, a savvy investor, or both."" Some reality-based games hit too close to home, however. Late last month, publisher Konami killed one controversial game before it was even released. ""Six Days in Fallujah"" was billed as a documentary-like experience in which players could feel like they were part of the 2004 U.S. campaign against insurgents in the Iraqi city. Although Iraq War veterans were enlisted as consultants in the game's development, critics accused the publisher of trivializing one of the bloodiest battles of an ongoing war. A Konami spokesperson told CNN he couldn't comment on the matter. A few ambitious game developers such as NewsGaming.com publish challenging, event-inspired online simulations. ""September 12"" lets players explore the U.S. response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, while ""Madrid"" takes a similar approach to the March 11, 2004, attacks in Spain. ""Traditionally, videogames have focused on fantasy rather than reality, but we believe that they can be a great tool for better understanding our world,"" explains the site. ""We prefer games that encourage critical thinking, even if the player disagrees with our games' ideas."" But most news-related games are simple Flash games that are churned out quickly to capitalize on current events. While amusing at first, they lack the complexity to hold gamers' attention for long, experts say. ""They're not very sophisticated. They're pretty much like home brew ... made by two or three people in their basement for a laugh,"" said DigitalTrends' Steinberg. ""They're flashes in the pan. They can rack up millions of plays, but three years from now, will anybody still be trying to get the high score on 'Swinefighter?' ""","Developers are creating online and cell phone games inspired by real news events .

"(CNN) -- Whether you're into baseball or backgammon, Harry Potter or heavy metal, Ning has an online network for you. Gina Bianchini, CEO of Ning, says her site brings together people with common interest and passions. A fast-growing, free Web site launched two years ago, Ning lets members custom build their own social-networking platforms based around their passions and pastimes. As Facebook and MySpace connect people to friends and family, Ning gathers users around common interests. The site hosts networks for hip-hop music lovers, video gaming moms and teens obsessed with the Twilight book and movie franchise. Other popular Ning networks bring people together online for political and social causes such as ""Pickens' Plan,"" which advocates wind energy. Ning had 4.7 million unique visitors as of January and surpassed 1 million social networks -- about one-fifth of them considered active -- last month. Ning also enhanced its site in March with new features such as a real-time activity feed so users can get up-to-the-minute reports -- not unlike Twitter's tweets -- about what others are doing. CNN spoke recently to Ning CEO Gina Bianchini, a Silicon Valley native and former Goldman Sachs analyst, about the company and the future of social networking.  Watch Bianchini chat about Ning Â» . CNN: Where did this idea for Ning come from? Bianchini: We really started with a very simple premise. What if you gave people the opportunity to create their own social experiences for their own unique passions/topics/interest? We started on the ground floor to build it in such a way that it can be customized and programmed and made truly unique for each individual. I believe the most powerful ideas are the most simple. CNN: What is the mission of Ning? Bianchini: It's a way to get people to organize and get people to meet around their passions. CNN: Did any specific Web sites or companies inspire you to create Ning? Bianchini: We were really inspired by the first wave of Internet companies truly native to the Web like Craigslist and eBay. They were really around people connecting to other people. They were really about the Internet connecting people to each other. It's completely unique to the Internet -- you can't do it via television or newspapers. CNN: Did you expect the idea of connecting people though common interests to be so successful? Bianchini: Social behavior is really what people want to do online. It was clear for the rapid adoption of social networking in general that it is very much the case. CNN: What are some of the interesting social networks on Ning? Bianchini: There are 200,000 social networks are active right now, and they are across tens of thousands of unique passions. There is a network called 'This is 50.' It's like a hip hop TMZ. Another is the 'Pickens' Plan.' It's a way they are organizing more than 200,000 people around wind-energy policy. There is another one for cricket, specifically Indian cricket, which has added half a million people in the last two and a half weeks. There is another about the Twilight saga for teens. So it ranges from 50 Cent to teens talking about Twilight to serious adults looking at how to make changes in government policy. That's the power of the Internet and the power of connecting people. CNN: What do you attribute to the growth of Ning? Bianchini: What's fundamental in the adoption of Ning is that people are unique. They have unique interest and passion and they like having a contact for that experience and for their identity. CNN: What makes Ning different from other social-networking sites? Bianchini: It's focused on providing the [means for] people to create new social networks around their interests and passions and connect new people around those passions. We think that's a very critical element of organization. The Facebook phenomenon connects you to people you already know and Twitter is amazing for news and real-time events. What we see with people who gravitate to Ning is meeting new people with similar interests. CNN: How can Ning be useful to organizations or corporations? Bianchini: When you can bring people together around a common cause there is incredible potential to do fundraising and to organize volunteers. CNN: How does your site make money? Bianchini: If you want to add a feature like making your own domain, you can pay a la carte for options. On the free service there are ads contextual to what the network is. CNN: What are your thoughts on the future of social networking? Bianchini: Niche social networking sites are absolutely something people want  to do. People clearly want to do this. . .[and] as people get more comfortable with social networking via Facebook, Twitter, they will look around and say, 'I want a social network for this particular group.' CNN: What are some of your company's goals in the future? Bianchini: We are really focused on making our service perfect for people who come to meet new people. We're growing really rapidly and we're seeing a lot of interest and new people joining social networks.","CNN talks to Gina Bianchini, CEO of Ning, a fast-growing Web site .

"(CNN) -- Search crews have recovered the bodies of the flight captain and a steward from the Air France flight that crashed off the coast of Brazil. A Brazilian diver floats on wreckage of Flight 447 earlier this month. The search for more debris continues. The two flight members are among the victims that have been identified, Air France said in a statement Thursday. About a dozen victims have been identified among roughly 50 bodies recovered from the crash of Flight 447, which killed 228 people on June 1, authorities in Brazil said this week. Crews continue to search for bodies, wreckage and flight-data recorders that apparently rest deep on the ocean floor. Data from the recorders may be crucial in helping investigators determine what caused the plane to crash.  Watch more wreckage recovered from crash Â» . Autopsies conducted on some of the 50 bodies found so far show they suffered broken bones, including arms, legs and hips, Brazilian authorities have told French investigators, according to Paul-Louis Arslanian, head of the French accident investigation board. Such injuries suggest that the plane broke apart in midair, experts have said. Asked about that theory, Air France Chief Executive Pierre-Henri Gourgeon told France's RTL radio this week that he would not go that far. ""What I know is that the investigators would like to know the causes of death,"" Gourgeon said. ""That knowledge of causes of death will better clarify what exactly happened. Were the victims killed before the impact, or during impact?"" Searchers have found dozens of pieces of debris in the water and think they know the general location of the wreck, but Arslanian said this week that there is a chance the entire aircraft may never be found. Air France plans to pay relatives of the victims an initial compensation equivalent to about $24,500, or 17,500 euros, for each victim, Gourgeon has said. The airliner said this week that it has been in touch with about 1,800 relatives of the people who died when the Airbus A330 crashed, but that it has been difficult tracing the relatives of all 228 victims. ""The modern world is different and we often have only a cell phone, and as you can imagine, this cell phone is unfortunately in the aircraft,"" Gourgeon said. ""So we probably (will put in) more hours to access all the relatives."" The company is also providing families with counseling, he said. The were 32 different nationalities present on Flight 447.","Search crews recover bodies of flight captain and steward from crash .

"(CNN) -- The United States successfully tested a sea-based component of its missile defense shield Thursday evening, intercepting a ballistic missile with a dummy warhead over the Pacific Ocean, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency said. A dummy missile is launched from a ship during a 2008 test of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Program. The exercise was the 19th successful test in 23 attempts of the system -- known as the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Program -- since 2002. A target missile was fired from Hawaii about 5:40 p.m. (11:40 p.m. ET) and was tracked by Navy ships hundreds of miles away. The USS Hopper, one of three Navy ships tracking the launch, fired an interceptor missile, which struck the target about 100 miles above the Earth. The process -- from launch to shoot-down -- took less than five minutes, according to the U.S. military. The United States plans to use the sea-based system on Navy Aegis-class ships to protect against incoming short- to medium-range missiles fired from hostile countries. Eighty-six of the ships eventually will have the capability. Another part of the missile defense protection -- ground-based midcourse defense -- is designed to strike at long-range missiles. Both the sea-based and ground-based systems are part of the Pentagon's ""layered"" missile defense plan. Much of the missile defense program is still under development, including lasers fired from a plane that the military hopes would destroy an enemy missile during launch. Other parts of the missile defense would fire short-range missiles at incoming warheads that are close to hitting their targets. Over the past seven years, the U.S. military has spent billions of dollars on the missile defense program. Pentagon officials have said that each missile defense test costs about $85 million.","Ship-based system shoots down dummy missile from hundreds of miles away .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- It was a glass half-full, glass half-empty kind of weekend at the box office for ""Funny People,"" writer-director Judd Apatow's comedic meditation on fame, humor, life, and death. Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen star in ""Funny People,"" which took the No. 1 slot at the box office this weekend. According to figures from Hollywood.com Box Office, it opened at the top spot with an estimated $23.4 million, better than Apatow's The 40 Year-Old Virgin ($21.4 million) -- hence, the glass is half full. But that figure is far lower than the debut for Apatow's ""Knocked Up"" ($30.7 million), and it's the worst opening for a comedy for star Adam Sander since his 2000 turkey ""Little Nicky"" -- hence, the glass is half empty. Of course, ""Funny People"" was billed more as a thoughtful dramedy than a balls-out Sandler laugh-fest, and when matched against the opening frames for Sandler's serious efforts ""Reign Over Me,"" ""Spanglish,"" and ""Punch-Drunk Love,"" Funny People is far and away the winner -- and the glass is half full again. But whether it's a comedy, drama, or dramedy, ""Funny People's"" $75 million budget is quite the handful of pretty pennies, and with a shaky ""B-"" Cinemascore, the film is going to have a hard time overcoming tepid word-of-mouth -- and we're back to the half-empty glass. So let's just move on, shall we? The cup of a certain adolescent wizard, meanwhile, definitely runneth over. Thanks to its debut on IMAX (and the premium ticket prices that come with it), ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" came in second with $17.7 million, a soft 40 percent drop from last weekend for $255.5 million total. At this rate, the film is well on its way to the upper ranks of the 'Potter' franchise. The guinea pigs of ""G-Force"" were right on its heels at third place, nibbling up $17.1 million, a decent 46 percent drop for a two-week cume of $66.5 million. And Katherine Heigl's romcom ""The Ugly Truth"" took in an additional $13 million, a 53 percent drop for fourth place and $54.5 million total. Of the two other wide releases this weekend, at least the sci-fi family comedy ""Aliens in the Attic"" -- which grossed a meager $7.8 million for fifth place -- broke into the top 10. The torture porn flick ""The Collector"" collected a grisly $3.6 million and plopped dead at 11th place. Box office on a whole was down a massive 22 percent from last year, when The ""Dark Knight"" and ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" both took in over $40 million, but the specialty market showed some vibrant signs of life. Bone fide indie hit ""(500) Days of Summer"" expanded to 266 theaters for $2.7 million, a $10,338 per theater average. And three widely disparate films opened in four theaters each to healthy per theater averages: The quirky romantic comedy ""Adam"" ($16,566 per theater), the stylish vampire film ""Thirst"" ($13,793 per theater), and the eco-thriller-cum-documentary ""The Cove"" ($13,600 per theater). Finally, a true milestone was reached this weekend by ""The Hangover."" With $5.1 million this weekend for a running total of $255.8 million, the summer's biggest die hard blockbuster has passed ""Star Trek"" and (for a brief moment) ""Harry Potter 6"" as the third highest grossing movie of the year.

"(CNN) -- Four years ago, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei kissed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on the cheek before he was sworn in as Iran's new leader. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad could be in for a rocky second term as Iranian president, analysts say. Song and prayer heralded a new start for Iran with the hard-line Tehran mayor, virtually unknown to the outside world in 2005. He promised to stamp out corruption and fight for justice. With time, the world came to know the Iranian leader with his signature beige jacket and combative -- often anti-Israeli -- rhetoric. Monday, Iran's supreme leader endorsed Ahmadinejad for a second term in office, but there was no hug or kiss this time around. Video from the event shows Ahmadinejad leaning toward Khamenei before the supreme leader raises his left hand to block him, leaving Ahmadinejad to gingerly kiss the cleric's robe. The awkward scene seemed to only bolster the tensions that have emerged in the once strong relationship. Under Iran's constitution, the incoming president must receive the supreme leader's approval before being sworn into office. Khamenei's endorsement is the first step in that process. On Wednesday, Ahmadinejad will take the oath of office before Parliament. But he will begin his second term in a deeply fractured Iran, one in which the conservative leader finds himself under assault from the legions of pro-democracy supporters and the nation's powerful clerical establishment. Given the unprecedented fissures in Iranian society, some longtime scholars and observers now doubt whether Ahmadinejad will finish his second term in office. Some question whether the clerical establishment will sacrifice him in order to save the Islamic republic. Ahmadinejad's main political problem is ""legitimacy,"" said Alex Vatanka, senior Middle East analyst at IHS Jane's, a provider of defense and security information. ""Can you operate for four years with huge questions over whether you are the rightful president?"" Vatanka said. ""I think that would undermine everything he does."" Ahmadinejad was declared the winner of Iran's June 12 election, but thousands took to the streets in the aftermath to protest what they believed was a rigged vote. They chanted the name of Ahmadinejad's chief rival, reformist Mir Hossein Moussavi, the crowds a sea of green, the color of the opposition candidate's campaign. Since then, widespread demonstrations have plagued Iran's leaders, who have ordered security forces to crack down swiftly and violently. Iranians have been arrested and jailed, their treatment condemned by global human rights organizations such as Amnesty International. Khamenei stood by his president, but strains in the relationship have surfaced in recent days after Ahmadinejad refused at first to heed the supreme leader's orders to change a controversial vice-presidential pick. Iran's clerics have made it known they would like Ahmadinejad ""to remain a powerful and popular president"" and reminded Iran that the supreme leader's word is the last one in the Islamic Republic. On the eve of his inauguration, Ahmadinejad sought to downplay any rift. In a public address, he compared his relationship with Khamenei to that of a father and son. But Kazem Alamdari, lecturer in sociology at California State University, Northridge, said Ahmadinejad has alienated the clerics just as he has the reformists. Alamdari said Ahmadinejad risks losing conservative supporters who may feel that Iran's system has been placed in danger and that the situation has ""created an atmosphere for external forces to attack Iran."" If convinced the system is truly threatened, Khamenei could use his power to dismiss Ahmadinejad, Alamdari said. It wouldn't be the first time a supreme leader has made such a move. The Islamic Society of Engineers, a conservative group and ally of Ahmadinejad, in a statement warned that he could suffer the same fate as Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq. He lost the support of the clerics, consequently the people, and eventually was deposed in a 1953 CIA-backed coup. Iran's first president after the 1979 Islamic revolution, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, was forced to flee the country after he stood against the clerics, including then-Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The Islamic Society of Engineers statement asked Ahmadinejad for ""absolute obedience of the supreme leader."" Adding to Ahmadinejad's political worries is a faltering economy. The world may have viewed Iran's June 12 vote through the prism of individual freedoms and nuclear weapons, but most Iranians paid close attention to a staggering inflation rate, double-digit unemployment and the expenditure of oil revenue. With oil prices plummeting to below $40 a barrel, the Iranian government may be facing unsustainable budget deficits. Some analysts said the president's first-term economic mismanagement had already earned him the ire of the establishment, long before any controversy erupted over his political legitimacy. One scholar, who is currently in Iran and did not want be identified for safety reasons, said it is increasingly clear the regime has not chalked out a perfect path to the future -- and how long Ahmadinejad will be along for the ride. Vatanka said Ahmadinejad lacks the political mindset for consensus and collaboration. But what empowers him may be his belief in himself. And one other weapon: he thinks God is on his side.","Mahmoud Ahmadinejad slated to be sworn in for second term as Iran president .

"(CNN) -- He was not able to fulfill his childhood dream of being a pilot, but Ghanaian scientist Dr. Ave Kludze has arguably gone one better: developing and flying spacecrafts for NASA. The moon, Mars and beyond: All are in the sights of Dr. Ave Kludze. The 43-year-old didn't enter orbit when controlling a NASA rocket to launch the Calipso environmental satellite in 2006, instead piloting it from the control center on the ground. Nevertheless from growing up in Ghana to being an astronautical engineer and strategist for NASA, he has had a similarly stratospheric rise to the top. Growing up in Accra, Kludze was fascinated by science and how things worked. ""I was a very curious kid and I always questioned lots of things, and most of my friends I grew up with, they knew that. And my parents, they were a little bit concerned because sometimes I would take apart a lot of things they would not want me to touch,"" he told CNN. When he realized he could not become a pilot because of his eyesight he channeled his energies into studying engineering, moving to the U.S. to complete a course in electrical engineering at Rutgers University. On graduating Kludze initially planned to return to Ghana to develop solar technologies, but then NASA came calling in 1995. ""I never did dream of working for NASA. I admired what they did, but it never did cross my mind. I did not see how a kid like me could work for NASA,"" he said. He commanded his first spacecraft from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and has gone on to develop an extra-vehicular infra-red camera as well as other projects for the space agency. While he didn't return to Ghana as he originally planned, he still believes that his work -- and NASA's -- has had some benefits to his native country and more down-to-earth lives. ""Well, NASA has done a lot for Africans. Maybe Africans they no know that. They have cell phones, glasses, anti-scratch and all those things. We have portable water system that NASA has developed for Africa. They're using it,"" he said. ""And one thing people often forget, NASA doesn't only develop space technology, we also develop aeronautical technology. So when the planes they fly and other flying objects, NASA's technology has been involved in that."" Kludze is also keen to pass on the message that for young Africans, the sky is the limit in terms of what they do with their lives. ""I've learned that being given the freedom to think and think openly helps bring in new ideas. So in community, like in an African communities, I think younger generations and both the old and the young should freely share ideas and break those old barriers. ""So I believe that with some determination and some hard work most of the younger generation can get whatever they want to. They can even go into space, they can do anything.""","American-Ghanaian engineer is one of NASA's top strategists .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Why would an award-winning singer, songwriter, producer and single mother want to tack reality TV star onto her long list of accomplishments? Kandi Burruss says she is happy to join the ""Real Housewives of Atlanta"" cast. For Kandi Burruss, the newest member of the Real Housewives of Atlanta, the answer is simple: ""I was a fan last year. I love the show."" The second season of Bravo's hit show is set to premier on Thursday with Burruss replacing cast member DeShawn Snow. Burruss is well-known in the music industry as a former member of the platinum-selling R&B girl group Xscape and co-writer of such hits as Destiny's Child's ""Bills, Bills, Bills"" and TLC's ""No Scrubs,"" for which she won a Grammy. The Atlanta native almost ended up on another reality show with former group mate and writing partner Tameka ""Tiny"" Cottle, who is the fiancÃ©e of rapper T.I. and now stars on BET's ""Tiny & Toya"" alongside Antonia ""Toya"" Carter, the ex-wife of Lil' Wayne. The deal for that show didn't work out and Burruss said she was more than happy to sign on with Bravo's wildly successful southern edition of the ""Housewives"" franchise, which chronicles the lives of a group of affluent African-American women in the ATL. Burruss was already friendly with cast mate Lisa Wu Hartwell, whom she met through their mutual friend Cottle. Having watched the show -- which last season enraptured viewers with a mix of constant infighting, lavish lifestyles and a healthy dose of drama -- Burruss said she was more concerned with being thrust into the public eye than she was with getting along with the cast. ""The only thing that made me hesitant about wanting to be a part of the show is the fact that people are so critical of the show,"" she said. ""Just dealing with people on the outside judging you. That part is going to be something that I am going to have to get used to."" The artist has already had to get acclimated to people smearing her personal life on the Internet.  Watch Burruss discuss her time on the show Â» . Newly engaged to a father of six children, Burruss has watched him get attacked in blogs and is protective of the man who she said even her mother isn't thrilled about her marrying. ""[The show] has been very, very stressful on the relationship,"" she said. ""I guess [people] couldn't find anything bad [to say] about me, so they wanted to go in on my fiancÃ©."" Her caring nature and laid-back personality make Burruss special in the industry, said rapper Rick Ross. ""She's a very humble person, maybe one of the most humble people among the biggest songwriters in the industry,"" said Ross, who collaborated with Burruss on a track for a new solo album she has in the works. ""It's good to be around the greats and she most definitely is one of the greatest in the industry."" Her home music studio attests to that. The walls are covered with gold and platinum records for her work with several high-profile artists including Alicia Keys, *NSYNC, Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Being part of a girl group helped prepare her for the drama of dealing with the other housewives' personalities, Burruss said, though she admitted clashing with outspoken cast mate NeNe Leakes during filming. ""I was a fan of hers last year,"" Burruss said. ""All that wild and crazy stuff she says to people, when you're watching it, it's funny, it's hilarious... but when it's directed at you, it's not funny anymore."" Burruss got along better with aspiring singer Kim Zolciak, who Burruss will assist in achieving her dream of breaking into the industry. Last season, fans of the show -- and some of the other housewives -- slammed Zolciak for her less-than-stellar voice. ""Everybody loves to hate on Kim. But what I have to say is that Kim is actually cooler in person than she came off on the show,"" said Burruss, who in 1999 won top songwriter of the year from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. ""I wanted to help her out because I love helping the underdog."" The busy artist said she has no idea if she will be invited back for another season. Appearing on the show, which Burruss said is not scripted, was fun, but she is busy with an upcoming album and with caring for her daughter, Riley, she said. She doubts she will be addicted to appearing on reality TV like she is addicted to music, Burruss said. ""It's just another way for people to get to know you and hopefully they see me in a good light,"" she said. ""You always hope that it doesn't backfire.""","Kandi Burruss is the newest member of Bravo's ""Real Housewives of Atlanta""

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- It couldn't top its predecessors, but ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" still brought in quite a haul, grossing an estimated $87 million for the opening weekend of the summer movie season. Hugh Jackman stars as the title character in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine."" The Hugh Jackman pic brought in a strong $21,225 per-theater average in 4,099 movie houses, despite generating mixed reviews. The film fell $15 million short of 2006's ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" but it is still an enormous success for Jackman and director Gavin Hood. Matthew McConaughey's ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past"" generated an estimated $15.3 million for a second place bow. It's not a shabby opening but it is far less than McConaughey's previous romantic outings including last year's ""Fool's Gold"" ($21.6 million) or 2006's ""Failure to Launch"" ($24.2 million). (Perhaps women were too busy checking out all those hunky mutants this weekend?) The two new openers did help the industry maintain its year-over-year increase of 16 percent. Also aiding that statistic was Beyonce Knowles' ""Obsessed."" Dropping a not-surprising 57 percent for its second weekend in theaters, the thriller earned another $12.2 million to put its ten-day gross at a shockingly strong $47 million. And Zac Efron's ""17 Again"" showed surprising stamina, too, grossing an additional $6.3 million its third weekend for a total take of $48.4 million. The other new wide release for the weekend was the anemic 3-D animated sci-fi film ""Battle for Terra."" Opening on 1162 theaters, the Justin Long, Evan Rachel Wood-voiced feature proved to be little competition for the other 3-D movie in the marketplace. Dreamworks Animation's juggernaut ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" grossed another $5.8 million its sixth weekend for the fifth slot in the rankings, while newcomer ""Terra"" couldn't muster more than $1 million for a twelfth place in the box office derby. Summer has officially begun -- at least in Hollywood -- so expect a giant event film every weekend.

"(CNN) -- Michael Jackson's bizarre private life and change in appearance ended up eclipsing his musical achievements, according to the world's media. A Los Angeles fire official told CNN that paramedics arrived at Michael Jackson's home after a 911 call. Jackson's death from cardiac arrest Thursday has sparked an outpouring of grief from fans, and his life has been given a more measured summing up by news media. Britain's Guardian newspaper said ""his bizarre life-style and personal notoriety eclipsed his talent and his numerous achievements."" The Guardian said his fame, from the age of 11, ""had such a damaging effect that his life was permanently affected.""  Watch why Jackson is ""as big as it gets"" Â» . ""A combination of dysfunctional family and invasive fame ate away at the essentially private singer, whose initially minor eccentricities escalated into grotesque changes to his appearance and lifestyle. ""If ever there was an illustration of the adage that celebrity destroys what it touches, Jackson was it,"" the Guardian said. Daily Mail agreed, saying Jackson ""courted controversy and acclaim in equal measure.""  Watch Jesse Jackson share memories Â» . ""It was the tales of oxygen chambers, chimp chums, shopping sprees and physical transformation that have brought intrigue and amusement and earned the singer the nickname Wacko Jacko."" The Mail said star's behavior drew increasing alarm following a ""documentary in which he pronounced sharing a bedroom with a child to be 'charming' and an incident in Germany in which he dangled his baby son Prince Michael II over a balcony."" The country's Times newspaper said only a ""handful of performers -- (Elvis) Presley, (Frank) Sinatra, the Beatles -- could outrank Michael Jackson as the most successful popular music entertainer of all time.""

Australia's Sydney Morning Herald newspaper also compared Jackson to Presley. ""Just as Presley was the iconic voice and presence of the 1950s so Jackson enjoyed a similar status during 1980s and 1990s.

"(CNN) -- Brazil's economic powerhouse was once thought of as the ugly sister to Rio de Janiero's beach-fronted glamour. SÃ£o Paulo, the world's fifth largest city, is the fashion capital of Brazil. But, over the past few years, SÃ£o Paulo' fashion, music and design scenes have gained such momentum that it's tipped by some as cooler destination than more touristy Rio. True, SÃ£o Paulo doesn't have a beach, nor does it go out of its way to cater to foreign visitors, but hidden in the sprawl is a trove of hip hotels and restaurants, modernist architecture and some of the best shopping south of the Equator. It would take a lot longer than a day to discover everything SÃ£o Paulo has to offer, but our guide should help visitors short on time to navigate the city's immense grid of skyscrapers and traffic jams to find an entirely different Brazilian experience. Watch the sun come up over the world's fifth largest urban area like many of its mega-wealthy inhabitants -- with a helicopter ride over the city. Tourist rides normally leave from Campo de Marte Airport and take in aerial views of city landmarks like Ibirapuera Park and Avenida Paulista. You may have worked up an appetite by now so head back into town for breakfast on Rua Oscar Freire, SÃ£o Paulo's answer to Rodeo Drive. Eat delicious cheese bread known as pÃ£o de queijo, fruit, yoghurt and granola and wash it down with a freshly squeezed juice or coffee at Oscar Cafe. The prosperous, tree-lined avenues of the surrounding area, known as Jardins, are perfect for a bit of shopping. Look out for Clube Chocolate where you can buy upscale designerwear in divine surroundings ( Rua Oscar Freire 913) and Endossa, a collaborative shop filled with cubes of shelving where entrepreneurs can rent a cubby-hole to sell their wares. It's possible to walk to Avenida Paulista, SÃ£o Paulo's financial district from here, and there you can mill past some of the most expensive real estate in South America with the Paulistano business folk on your way to take in some culture at MASP, also known as SÃ£o Paulo Museum of Art. Once you've had your fill of high culture, take in some of SÃ£o Paulo's famous street art on Beco de Batman, which translates as ""Batman Alley."" Every inch of this street in the super hip Vila Madalena area is covered in graffiti, much of it by well-known local artists. Recharge your batteries with a beer and snack on empadas, delicious miniature pies with a variety of fillings like palm hearts, Portuguese salted fish and cheese at Empanadas (Rua Wisard 489, Vila Madalena). Otherwise, why not hop in a cab and head over to Liberdade and check out the home of the biggest Japanese community anywhere in the world outside Japan. Check out the Buddhist temple (Rua SÃ£o Joaquim), the karaoke bars and sushi restaurants -- one of the best of which is TakÃ´ (Rua da GlÃ³ria 746, Liberdade). With a shimmering green-copper facade, the Unique Hotel is just one example of SÃ£o Paulo's stunning modern architecture. The highlight of this area, if you happen to be lucky enough to be there at the right time, is the anything goes weekend market Feira da Liberdade (PraÃ§a da Liberdade) and if you're even luckier you might catch one of the sumo competitions held there from time to time. After all these hours in the concrete jungle you may be longing for a bit of green, which you can find in ample supply in the enormous Ibirapuera Park. As you wander the tree-lined walkways, dodging throngs of body-conscious Paulistanos exercising along the way, you will encounter one masterpiece of modernist architecture after another -- mostly designed by the father of Brazilian modernism Oscar Niemeyer. Look out for the beautiful sci-fi dome, Oca and the Grande Marquise an extraordinary white pavilion which houses MAM (Museu de Arte Moderna) and features expanses of covered concrete which attract many of the city's skateboarders. No visit to SÃ£o Paulo, or indeed any part of Brazil, is complete without a trying a caipirinha -- a winning combination of the local firewater, cachaca, smashed limes, sugar and ice. If spirits are a bit much for you, try a divine -- and very Paulistano -- twist on the original with squished kiwi fruit and sake. You could combine a few cocktails with catching the final rays of the day on the rooftop of of another of SÃ£o Paulo's modernist masterpieces, EdifÃ­cio ItÃ¡lia (Terraza Italia Restaurant, Avenida Ipiranga 344). Here you can enjoy a breathtaking panorama, with another Niemeyer masterpiece -- the wavy-facaded EdifÃ­cio Copan -- in full view. It's got to be dinner time by now. In SÃ£o Paulo your options are almost unlimited. With huge populations of Japanese, Italians and, even Lebanese, the problem is not where to eat but how to choose. A highlight of the Sao Paulo's dining scene has to be Restaurante Figueira Rubaiyat where you can eat awesome steaks and very good seafood in a dining room that has been built around an enormous fig tree. If you're still raring to go after that little lot, SÃ£o Paulo's nightlife options are almost endless. You can shake your moneymaker with the best of them at one of the city's clubland stalwarts Love Story, or if you are looking for something a little more low key then why not round off the day on the rooftop terrace of the Skye Bar at Hotel Unique. The hotel's space-age green copper facade is indeed unique, and it is also a good bet for a bed for the night in really special surroundings.","SÃ£o Paulo's art, fashion and music scene means it's no longer second to Rio .

"TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (CNN)  -- Hours after the sitting president was deposed by a military-led coup, a new president of Honduras was sworn in Sunday. Honduras President Jose Manuel Zelaya was detained and sent to Costa Rica, the government said. But the former president was not ready to give up his powers. The political developments that swept Honduras over the past weeks and led up to Sunday's coup had the makings of a crisis, but the situation in the Central American nation of 8 million people was calm. Roberto Micheletti was sworn in as provisional president to the applause of members of Congress, who chanted, ""Honduras! Honduras!"" Outside the building, supporters of ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya protested, but their numbers were limited, and the streets remained mostly peaceful. Micheletti told CNN en EspaÃ±ol Sunday evening that he has imposed an ""indefinite"" curfew. Micheletti, the head of Congress, became president after lawmakers voted by a show of hands to strip Zelaya of his powers, with a resolution stating that Zelaya ""provoked confrontations and divisions"" within the country. A letter of resignation purported to be from Zelaya was read to members before the vote. But the deposed president, Zelaya, emphatically denied in an interview with CNN en EspaÃ±ol that he wrote the letter. Speaking from Costa Rica, where he was taken after the coup, he said he plans to continue exercising his presidential duties with a trip to Managua, Nicaragua, to attend a summit of Central American heads-of-state. Zelaya awoke to the sound of gunfire in his residence and was still in his pajamas when the military forced him to leave the country Sunday morning, he told reporters. He was flown to Costa Rica, where he has not requested political asylum. ""This was a brutal kidnapping of me with no justification,"" Zelaya said. He called the coup an attack on Honduran democracy. ""There are ways to protest without arms,"" Zelaya said. The coup came on the same day that he had vowed to follow through with a nonbinding referendum that the Honduran Supreme Court had ruled illegal.  Watch details on ""curious situation"" in Honduras Â» . The coup was widely criticized in the region, in strongest terms by Zelaya's leftist allies, including Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. A statement from Venezuela's foreign ministry said Zelaya was ""violently expelled from his country by a group of unpatriotic, coup-mongering soldiers."" The Bolivian government also condemned the coup, accusing Honduran troops of kidnapping Zelaya and violently expelling him from his country. Elsewhere, Jose Miguel Insulza, the secretary-general of the Organization of American States, strongly condemned the coup in a statement. And in Washington, President Obama said in a statement that he was ""deeply concerned"" by the news. ""I call on all political and social actors in Honduras to respect democratic norms, the rule of law and the tenets of the Inter-American Democratic Charter,"" Obama said. ""Any existing tensions and disputes must be resolved peacefully through dialogue free from any outside interference."" The president of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann, called the Honduran military's intervention a ""criminal action."" But in Honduras, the Supreme Court said in an official statement that the military was acting in accordance with a court order to put an end to Sunday's scheduled vote, which the court's justices had found illegal. Micheletti addressed the issue directly in his first remarks as provisional president. ""I did not reach this position because of a coup,"" Micheletti said. ""I am here because of an absolutely legal transition process."" No other countries immediately recognized Micheletti as president. Zelaya, a leftist elected in 2005, had found himself pitted against the other branches of government and military leaders over the issue of Sunday's planned referendum. It would have asked voters to place a measure on November's ballot allowing the formation of a constitutional assembly that could modify the nation's charter to allow the president to run for another term. In various interviews Sunday, Zelaya characterized the vote not as a referendum, but as a survey to gauge receptiveness toward a constitutional assembly. He denied that he would have been the beneficiary of any future constitutional changes. Zelaya, whose four-year term ends in January 2010, cannot run for re-election under current law. The Honduran Supreme Court had ruled the poll illegal, and Congress and the top military brass agreed, but Zelaya had remained steadfast. In the end, it appeared the opposition to Zelaya was too great. The military confiscated the ballots from the presidential residence, in effect canceling the disputed vote. In separate appearances Sunday, Zelaya, Venezuela's Chavez and Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said that the military had also detained Honduran Foreign Minister Patricia Rodas, further raising regional tensions. Speaking in Havana, Rodriguez said that the Cuban, Venezuelan and Nicaraguan ambassadors to Honduras had tried but were unable to protect Rodas from a group of masked soldiers who forcibly took her from their grasp. Further details regarding that incident were unclear. ""If they attack our ambassadors, they will be declaring a state of war,"" Chavez said. ""If they have weapons, then we have weapons, too.""","Honduran Congress strips president of powers, names provisional president .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In Paul Syverson's photo album, there is only one family picture, taken right after his little sister was born. Paul, then 7, and his father beam with an identical grin. Amy Syverson visits the Iwo Jima memorial with mentor Kohn Fisher as part of a camp for kids of fallen soldiers. Two months later, his father, Army Maj. Paul Syverson III, was killed in action in Balad, Iraq. Five years after his loss, the pain still reverberates with sickening suddenness. To help cope, Paul headed out to spend the Memorial Day weekend with a young military volunteer mentor instead of his dad. ""I try not to think about the bad stuff,"" Paul said. ""I just try to remember him as an awesome guy and what a great dad he was."" Paul, 12, and his sister, Amy, now a cheeky and rambunctious 5-year-old in pigtails, joined 350 other grieving children at a camp for military families in Washington this Memorial Day. For many, the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, or TAPS, camp is a yearly tradition, a time for kids to play together and pay homage to their loved ones' sacrifices.  Watch as the children share losses and joy Â» . ""It's just a great way to come and be together and acknowledge the loss, and learn coping mechanisms and ways to get through the loss,"" said Paul's mother, Jackie. ""The kids, they love it. It's just a great way they can talk about their dads but still have a great time and still just be together."" TAPS is a nonprofit funded by private donations that has helped military families for 15 years. Families pay for their hotel rooms and a small registration fee for the camp. Donations usually cover the airfare. Military families often learn about the survivor camps in the casualty packet they receive when they are notified of a parent's death. Each child at the camp gets assigned a military mentor who is at his or her side throughout the weekend. The mentors -- many of whom are in their early 20s -- seem to form instant and deep connections with their charges. Some play touch football in the workshop rooms, the young children wildly tackling their muscular military escorts. Others color together or play board games. And sometimes they talk about pain and loss. ""They even ask me questions. They go, 'I don't know what a landmine is. What is a landmine?' "" said Matt Thibodeau, an active-duty soldier who was assigned to mentor Paul for the weekend. ""There were a couple children who didn't understand how their parents had passed away, and we try to just help to be there to support them if they need it, kind of a shoulder to cry on."" Thibodeau said volunteering for TAPS seemed almost like a duty, an extension of the brotherhood of the military. ""I thought, if I were to have children and I were to go and pass away, that I would want somebody to do the same for me,"" he said. ""A lot of people don't realize what their parents have done for the country, and we're to try to support that and give them a little of what they're missing."" During the weekend, the children take in the sights of the nation's capital. The mentors accompany them to the Fort Myer military base in Virginia to visit the horses that pull the caisson wagons during military funerals. At the Iwo Jima and Washington monuments, the groups pause to contemplate the sacrifices that generations of service members have made for the country. The groups also planned to attend President Obama's speech and wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day. ""This is their chance to reconnect with the military culture, learn coping strategies, learn how, on Memorial Day, America honors those who have served and died, and that their family is part of this national legacy,"" said Bonnie Carroll, founder of the TAPS program. For some campers, the circumstances of their loss make their feelings more complicated. Joey Ruocco, 15, lost his father in 2005. Marine Maj. John Ruocco committed suicide before he was to ship out for his second tour in Iraq. ""Dealing with something like your dad dying is one thing, and then having to think about all this stuff about suicide, about why, and is there something I could have done? Could have said?"" said Joey, who was 10 when his father died. ""But you can't think about that stuff. You have to think about the happy stuff, what he did with you."" The first time Joey came to camp, he said he worried he might be dogged by the stigma of his dad's suicide. But Joey said he was accepted without comment, and he's learned to be proud of his father's service and sacrifice -- and of his life -- all the same. ""Everything that you take for granted, all sorts of silly things, like being able to ride your bike down to the corner store to get a slushie or something, wouldn't be possible if it weren't for men like our friends out there, our dads,"" Joey said. ""They're keeping our country free and being able to do stuff like that.""","Camp offers refuge to military families, kids adjusting to loss of loved ones .

"(CNN) -- Farrah Fawcett, whose public battle with anal cancer has brought new attention to a rarely discussed disease, has not been given a timetable from her doctor about how much time she has left, according to her friend Alana Stewart. Farrah Fawcett, seen here in 2006, has waged a very public battle with anal cancer. ""No one has said to her you have two months to live,"" Stewart said Monday. ""So I'm looking at that as a really good sign."" Stewart talked with Lara Spencer, host of ""The Insider,"" who discussed her interview with Fawcett's close friend on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" Monday night. Spencer said Fawcett, her family and friends are clinging to hope for a recovery. ""She [Alana Stewart] doesn't want to throw out a number. And neither does Farrah. ... They're still hoping for that miracle,"" Spencer said. ""Farrah's Story,"" a documentary-style program that has followed the course of her illness and showed her grueling treatment in graphic detail, aired on NBC Friday and was viewed by almost 9 million people. Fawcett and partner Ryan O'Neal watched the show together, Spencer confirmed. ""Alana said it was the ultimate in bittersweet,"" Spencer said. ""You know, they're reliving two years of hell that they've endured together."" King asked Spencer whether Fawcett, who made her name a household word on the hit '70s TV series ""Charlie's Angels,"" and O'Neal might marry. ""He said you never know. He was cagey about it,"" Spencer said. ""And, you know, I think he would in a second. He's so madly in love with her."" King also had a panel of medical experts on his show to discuss Fawcett's cancer. Dr. Thomas Vogl, who at one time treated the actress in Germany, called her medical condition ""very, very serious."" Dr. Allyson Ocean, a medical oncologist in New York, said only about 5,000 cases of anal cancer are diagnosed in the United States yearly. Unlike Fawcett's case, it usually doesn't spread, and only about 10 to 15 percent of cases are advanced, Ocean said. Fawcett's cancer, however, is in Stage 4 and has spread to her liver. Ocean said there are various causes of anal cancer. ""One of the causes is a virus called the human papilloma virus, which is a sexually transmitted virus. It seems to be more common in women, in general, outside of any viral infections. Smoking is actually a risk factor,"" she said. King asked Dr. Paul Song, a radiation oncologist, if he had seen Stage 4 cancer cured. ""Not with anal cancer. I have seen it with other GI malignancies such as rectal cancer,"" Song said. ""But anal cancer is a little bit more difficult to treat."" Despite the bleak outlook, Song had praise for Fawcett and her documentary. ""I think one of the most powerful things that Miss Fawcett did in this documentary was give patients a sense of hope and to just show how she's handled this with such courage and dignity,"" Song said. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta told King that doctors have to strike a delicate balance when they are caring for patients such as Fawcett. ""You have to be absolutely honest with patients, but, you know, you don't want to strip away their hope and optimism, either. There are people, Larry, as you know, who beat the odds,"" Gupta said. Vogl told King he developed a close relationship with Fawcett during the time he treated her in Germany and expressed admiration for his one-time patient. ""From a lot of treatments and contact and communication, I think she is extremely special, an extremely brave person,"" he said.","""Insider"" host Lara Spencer says friends, family holding out for a miracle .

"(CNN) -- A Colorado company's recall last week of beef products possibly contaminated with E. coli has been expanded, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said this week. The recall came as a result of ""an ongoing investigation into 24 illnesses in multiple states,"" the USDA said. The initial recall of 41,280 pounds announced last Wednesday was voluntarily expanded Sunday to include an additional 380,000 pounds of products made by the JBS Swift Beef Company, of Greeley, Colorado, the USDA said. The recall came as a result of ""an ongoing investigation into 24 illnesses in multiple states, of which at least 18 appear to be associated,"" the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in a written statement. USDA spokesman Brian Mabry said no fatalities had been reported. On its Web site, the company said the suspect beef was produced at its Greeley plant on April 21 and distributed nationally and internationally. ""Each of our customers will be personally informed of this recall by phone,"" the wholesaler said. A spokesman would not identify those customers to CNN. ""That's ridiculous!"" said Sarah Klein, a staff attorney for the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest. ""JBS should be able to say who they sold meat to, and those companies should be able to say, 'These are the products we created from them.' "" She expressed concern that nearly seven months into the Obama administration, a key undersecretary position at the USDA has not been filled, which may be slowing the government's ability to respond to such health threats. ""That person in that position would have significant public health experience and understand how these processes work, how meat enters the chain of commerce,"" Klein said. The recall underscores the need for ""a comprehensive animal identification system"" that would allow meat suppliers to trace their products to an individual ranch, she said. Klein urged supermarkets that use customer loyalty cards to track shoppers' purchases to determine those who have bought the recalled meat. Boxes of the recalled product bear the establishment number ""EST. 969"" inside the USDA mark of inspection, the identifying package date of ""042109"" and a time stamp ranging from ""0618"" to ""1130,"" the statement said. It added that some of the beef products might have undergone further processing and might not have the ""EST. 969"" marking on products for sale directly to consumers. The USDA urged any customers with concerns to contact the store where they bought the meat. JBS spokesman Chandler Keys said his company's products may have had nothing to do with the outbreak. ""It is important for consumers to note that the recalled product from the date in question was sold by JBS as whole muscle cuts, not as ground beef,"" Keys said on the company's Web site. ""The ground beef that might have been associated with illness was produced by other companies who often do not use the antimicrobial intervention steps we employ in our facility to reduce the risk of the beef products."" He said JBS agreed to expand its recall ""out of an abundance of caution for consumers."" Symptoms of infection with E. coli bacteria can include severe or bloody diarrhea, vomiting and severe abdominal cramping. The USDA urged consumers to cook all ground beef or ground beef patties to an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit to kill any bacteria. CNN's Sabriya Rice contributed to this report.","Recall includes more than 420,000 pounds of meat from JBS Swift Beef Co.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A Los Angeles Superior Court judge on Monday approved an agreement granting Michael Jackson's mother, Katherine Jackson, permanent custody of his children. Katherine Jackson has accused the executors of her son Michael's estate of ""keeping her in the dark."" A hearing is scheduled for October to look at some remaining issues. An agreement between Katherine Jackson, 79, and Debbie Rowe, mother of Jackson's two eldest children, cleared the way for an uncontested custody hearing. Rowe, who was briefly married to Michael Jackson, agreed not to fight for custody in exchange for visits with the children. Katherine Jackson was in the courtroom along with her daughters LaToya and Rebbie and a son, Randy. Rowe did not attend Monday's hearing, but her attorney, Eric George, spoke briefly outside the courthouse. ""She's faced difficulties and pressures none of us know, and today's agreement shows that she responded with heart, integrity and selflessness,"" George said of Rowe. He also praised Katherine Jackson's attorneys for their part in bringing about the agreement. Michael Jackson's two oldest children -- Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., 12, and Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson, 11 -- signed consents to the agreement. He also has a 7-year-old son, Michael Joseph Jackson II, known as Blanket, with an unidentified surrogate. The custody agreement does not involve any financial payments to Rowe ""apart from the continuation of spousal support payments"" that Michael Jackson personally agreed to make to Rowe after the divorce, their lawyers said in a joint statement.  Watch Rowe's attorney talk about the decision Â» . Jackson's children have been living with their paternal grandmother at her Encino, California, home since their father's death June 25. Also at the hearing Monday, attorneys for Jackson's dermatologist, Dr. Arnold Klein, said he sought a role in the children's lives and wanted ""in some way to be involved"" in respect to their education and medical care, although he was not objecting to the custody agreement. But Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff denied Klein's request to be a party to the hearing. Details of how the children were conceived and who was the biological father have been closely guarded amid much public speculation. In an interview last month on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" Klein did not rule out being the biological father of the children. ""Not to the best of my knowledge,"" he said when asked by Diane Sawyer whether he was the father. ""All I can tell you is, best of my knowledge, I am not the father of these children. But I am telling you, if push comes to shove, I can't say anything."" Asked about Klein's attorneys saying he wants a role in the children's lives, George declined comment. Klein was not in the hearing Monday. Rowe and Jackson divorced in 1999, with Rowe giving him full custody while she got an $8.5 million settlement, according to court documents. Jackson later agreed to additional support. Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children. A California appeals court ruled that her rights were improperly terminated, opening the door for a possible custody battle. On Monday, Beckloff awarded Katherine Jackson all of the family allowance funds she requested but gave only 83.5 percent of what she requested in support of the children. He said he disallowed money for one item, which he described as ""quite a large amount"" that he was not sure was necessary. The allowance order is sealed. Beckloff set a hearing to revisit the allowance matter in January. Also Monday, Beckloff ordered Katherine Jackson be given copies of her son's contracts in connection with a series of concerts that had been scheduled for this summer. She sought the contracts between Michael Jackson and AEG, the company that was organizing and promoting the concerts, along with others involved in the tour. She has agreed to keep the contract provisions confidential. Sharing of the contracts was a major point of contention between Katherine Jackson and the two men who control her son's estate: John Branca, Michael Jackson's longtime personal attorney, and John McClain, a music industry executive and longtime friend. Branca's attorney argued in a court filing that his client had no choice but to request confidentiality from Katherine Jackson, since the contracts have a provision keeping them confidential. Katherine Jackson has also challenged the two men named as executors of her son's will. However, Beckloff did not rule on that matter Monday, saying he would like attorneys for the two sides to attempt to reach a resolution on their own. The attorneys conferred on the estate dispute during a morning recess that stretched to more than 90 minutes without reaching an agreement. Lawyers for Branca and McClain suggested Beckloff appoint them as executors of the will, but Beckloff instead extended their appointment as special administrators of Jackson's estate for another 60 days while he considers Katherine Jackson's objections. ""We believe the judge did the right thing,"" Branca's attorney, Howard Weitzman, told reporters after the hearing. ""We're quite pleased that the judge did what was appropriate."" He took no questions. During Monday's hearing, Beckloff asked one of her attorneys, Burt Levitch, if there was any objection to admitting the will for probate -- without deciding who its executors will be. Beckloff noted that no one has come forward to object to the terms of the will itself. Levitch agreed, and Beckloff officially admitted the will for probate. The action starts a 120-day clock running for the will to be probated. The will, written in 2002, places all of Michael Jackson's assets into a family trust benefiting his mother, his three children and unnamed charities. Katherine Jackson's attorneys filed a petition last week accusing the men who now control the estate of being ""intent on keeping her in the dark"" about deals they've made or are negotiating. Londell McMillan, Jackson's lead attorney, raised questions about ""a suspicious circle of relationships"" involving Branca and McClain. Katherine Jackson is asking the judge to order Branca, McClain and others to answer questions under oath about their business agreements to determine if they are ""fit and able"" to administer the estate. The men also were served with a 19-page demand for documents, including the AEG contracts. Branca's lawyers argued that Katherine Jackson's demand for documents is too broad and burdensome. But, McMillan said, ""such measures will not be necessary if Mrs. Jackson is appointed a co-executor of the estate."" Beckloff expressed concern, however, about delaying the appointment of executors for too long, since they must deal with any creditors to the estate that come forward. McMillan, in an interview with CBS Thursday, estimated the Jackson estate was worth $2 billion, while the executors have estimated in court that its value is around $500 million. The next hearings in the matter are scheduled for August 10 and August 28 to deal with safe harbor motions. Katherine Jackson wants Beckloff to set aside a provision in her son's will that anyone who challenges its terms can be dropped from the will.","Katherine Jackson named permanent guardian of Michael Jackson's kids .

"(CNN) -- Michael Jackson's impact on pop culture is indelible. But perhaps his biggest legacy will be how he changed the music industry. Jackson's impact on the music business still reverberates today. ""As a performer he changed history ... his singing, his songwriting, his choreography, his dancing, his business acumen,"" said Howard Bragman, a public relations expert who worked with Jackson to launch the singer's shoe line with L.A. Gear. ""He rewrote the history of the entertainment industry in his time,"" Bragman said. Jackson crossed color lines and broke down barriers between musical genres. He followed in the footsteps of Elvis and the Beatles to create a transnational fan base that prefigured the era of globalization. And Jackson became a canny power broker who helped lead artists from stage performers into major boardroom players. ""That gets lost in the last five and 10 years, with all the litigation battles -- what he did the first 30 years to set the landscape for these other artists,"" said James Walker, an entertainment attorney. ""Michael transcended race before Michael Jordan, before Oprah, before Tiger Woods, before Barack Obama. ""You can't underestimate what his did for black artists -- and artists as a whole -- as a business man,"" Walker added. His 1982 album ""Thriller"" has sold more than 50 million records worldwide -- a record that, considering the decline of record sales in the wake of new media, is likely to stand for some years to come. ""Records just don't sell that much anymore. The industry has changed. ... Now it's in shambles because of technology,"" said Gideon Yago, head of the IFC Media Project and a former correspondent for MTV News. Videos that accompanied the album became landmarks that set the industry standard, as MTV and cable television began to proliferate, creating ready outlets for a growing marketing tool. At the time, Jackson's label had to fight to get onto MTV, which then featured only rock artists. ""Walter Yetnikoff (former president of CBS records) drew a line in the sand and said, 'We believe in this guy and you're going to play his videos or we're going to pull all our videos,'"" Walker said. ""What he did was so cutting-edge regarding videos; he defined the video age as we know it,"" said Tommy Mottola, who succeeded Yetnikoff as head of CBS. Though his personal finances were in disarray at the end of his life, Jackson made some canny business decisions at the height of his power -- most notably buying half the Beatles music catalog in 1985 for $47.5 million. ""When you look at his royalties and his copyrights, he's probably got a half a billion to a billion (dollar) catalogue,"" Walker added. The current value of his estate is unclear. His debts stood at about $500 million, according to a Wall Street Journal story earlier this month. As the music industry model moved more toward live events in the face of dwindling album sales, two billionaire businessmen stepped in to bank on Jackson's comeback with a series of concerts scheduled in London. Tom Barrack, head of hedge fund Colony Capital, teamed with Philip Anschutz, owner of AEG Live, to plan a third-act comeback for Jackson, with a sold-out 50-date stand at AEG Live's O2 arena scheduled to begin next month. Future business plans included a world tour, a Broadway musical and even a ""Thriller"" casino. ""You are talking about a guy who could make $500 million a year if he puts his mind to it,"" Barrack told The Los Angeles Times in an article last month. ""There are very few individual artists who are multibillion-dollar businesses. And he is one."" Billboard magazine estimates $85 million in ticket sales from the sold-out concert series. Additional packages, merchandise and secondary market sales could have raised the total to $115 million. AEG Live declined to comment. ""There will be a process put in place for ticketing (refunds). I don't know what it is at the moment,"" said Lucy Ellison, spokeswoman for O2 stadium. ""We'll leave it for his family to say what they want to say before we discuss ticketing information."" Jackson was expected to earn $50 million from the London shows. CNN's Pauline Chiou contributed to this report .","Jackson transformed the role of artists as power brokers .

"ON PUGET SOUND, Washington (CNN) -- When commercial diver Kenny Woodside takes to the depths, he enters a world of murky low light and dangerous currents. Diver Kenny Woodside descends to the murky depths to retrieve an abandoned net. Until recently Woodside and about 100 hundred other divers searched Puget Sound for sea cucumbers and urchins to sell to buyers in Asia, where the items are considered delicacies. But demand for the fishermen's catch dried up with the worldwide economic crisis and left many of these divers without a reason to go out on the water. ""The fishing industry has slowed from a full-time job to just a couple months a year,"" said Doug Monk, the captain of the boat from which Woodside dives. ""The red sea urchin market is almost non-existent."" But thanks to a small piece of the federal stimulus recovery plan, Monk, Woodside and about 40 other fishermen will get back to work hauling in a very different catch: lost fishing nets. While many stimulus projects have come under fire as pork barrel spending, backers of the nets program say it is a model for helping those battered by the economic downturn while completing needed public works. Thousands of the large nets stretch across the floor of Puget Sound, where they create an environmental hazard. Some of the nets were lost by fishermen to the rocky coastline decades ago but continue to catch and kill. According to the Northwest Marine Conservation Initiative, the nets are responsible for killing tens of thousands of marine life, mammals and birds every year. The nets, some of which extend larger than a football field, can also tangle the propellers of boats and pose a danger to scuba divers. After struggling to find funding, the group received $4.6 million in stimulus funds to recover most of the nets that litter the unique Puget Sound ecosystem. The only reason the nets have remained underwater for so long, said Ginny Broadhurst, director of the Northwest Marine Conservation Initiative, is because the damage they are doing to the environment is invisible from the surface. ""If you had nets strung along the streets that are catching bunny rabbits and squirrels, we wouldn't be discussing whether we should be removing them. We would be pulling them. It would be immediate,"" said Broadhurst. ""When those threats are underwater it's so much harder to know what impacts they are having."" But pulling those nets is no easy task. Divers swim close to 100 feet down to an environment that is anything but friendly. Instead of using scuba equipment, they breathe through air hoses running from the boat above. When the divers find the fields of nets, they begin the labor of cutting them free piece by piece and all by hand. Removing one net can take days.  Watch the divers at work Â» . The nets are then pulled to the boat waiting on the surface. In just a few hours on the water, the divers can pull free about 1,000 pounds of nets. Inside are the bones of countless fish and birds, along with several species of protected sharks and crabs. Anything still alive is cut free and thrown back in the water. Then, biologist Jeff June notes what they have brought up. So far, he says, the group has identified 112 distinct species trapped in the nets. The fishing nets themselves are considered toxic after the years of catching so much sea life. The divers seal them in heavy duty plastic bags and, once on shore, take the nets to a landfill. But biologist June said the group is working on a plan that would have the nets burned, creating energy from lost fishing nets. Over the next 18 months the group expects to pull some 3,000 nets from Puget Sound. And in that time the fishing industry could bounce back from its slump, allowing Doug Monk and his crew to return to catching urchins and sea cucumbers. But, the boat captain said, recovering the fishing nets has greater meaning than just riding out a rough economy. ""We feel we are doing a good thing,"" he said. ""[With] harvest diving we are taking from the resources; here we are giving them back.""","Worldwide economic downturn has hit fishing industry hard .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A Bronx woman has been charged with murder and robbery in the death of an 89-year-old Nazi concentration camp survivor, and police said a man is still being sought in connection with the death. Felix Brinkmann dances at a 2008 birthday party. ""He was not the kind of guy who had enemies,"" his son says. Angela Murray, 30, was arrested Saturday, according to the Manhattan district attorney's office, and is accused of strangling Guido Felix Brinkmann on Thursday in his Upper East Side apartment. Murray was arraigned Sunday and charged with one count of murder in the second degree and three counts of robbery. Brinkmann, a native of Latvia, was a Holocaust survivor who escaped death for a year while he was in the Mauthausen, Ebensee and Auschwitz camps. He had been slated for the gas chambers five times, but each time, he used his fluency in German to talk his way out, said his son, Rick Brinkman, who spells his last name differently. After the war, he was stunned to discover his wife, who had also been shipped to Auschwitz, alive and well in Poland. The Brinkmanns immigrated to America, where Brinkmann spent years in the bar and nightclub business, co-founding the Adam's Apple disco in Manhattan in 1971. In recent years, he had been the real estate manager of a mixed-use building in the Bronx, working ""seven days a week, without fail,"" Rick Brinkman said. On Thursday, the building's superintendent grew concerned when Brinkmann did not show up for work. He notified Brinkmann's son and received permission to enter the father's apartment, where he had lived alone since his wife died last year. Brinkmann was found face-down in his bedroom, his hands bound behind his back and his body showing blunt-force trauma wounds, police said. Brinkmann's blue 2009 Honda Civic had been stolen, along with one of two safes in his apartment, police said. The vehicle was later recovered in the Bronx. Rick Brinkman speculated that the killing was random. ""Anybody who knew him really liked him,"" the son said. ""He was not the kind of guy who had enemies."" CNN's Jason Kessler contributed to this report.","Bronx woman charged with murder, robbery; police say a man is still being sought .

"BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN)  -- Lebanese voters were heading to the polls on Sunday with their main choices to lead the next government a Hezbollah-backed alliance or a U.S.-backed coalition. Hezbollah party workers in the southern town of Nabatiyah hope for an election victory. Analysts say the race will be tight, with the Hezbollah-dominated ""March 8 alliance"" possibly winning a majority of seats in parliament. The polls opened at 1200 GMT and will close 12 hours later. Turnout is expected to be high among the country's 3 million registered voters. About 50,000 troops were on the streets, but the run-up to the balloting had been free of violence. The vote comes at a critical time for Lebanon as it sits amid a power struggle between a weakened pro-Western government and a stronger pro-Syrian Hezbollah political bloc that has gained political momentum in recent years. The United States considers Hezbollah -- which is supported by both Syria and Iran -- to be a terrorist organization. The group grew in popularity after its militant wing claimed victory over Israel after a 34-day military conflict in 2006. Since then, it has been more widely perceived by its supporters to be the ""defenders"" of Lebanon. Though U.S. President Barack Obama didn't mention the Lebanese general election in his address on Thursday, he did call for religious tolerance in the Muslim world, noting sectarian clashes between Sunnis and Shiites and the struggles faced by religious minorities. ""The richness of religious diversity must be upheld -- whether it is for Maronites in Lebanon or the Copts in Egypt,"" he said, referring to Christian groups in those countries. ""And if we are being honest, fault lines must be closed among Muslims as well, as the divisions between Sunni and Shia have led to tragic violence, particularly in Iraq."" In Lebanon's unique power-sharing government, the presidency is reserved for Maronite Christians, the speaker of parliament is always a Shia Muslim, and the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim. The law was created to balance power among Lebanon's three main religious groups. Analysts say the Hezbollah-dominated ""March 8 alliance"" may win a parliamentary majority with the support of Christian opposition leader Gen. Michel Aoun -- the only prominent Christian politician to back the bloc. ""They keep trying to scare the Christian voters with their stories about Hezbollah's weapons, so to all of those who complain about Hezbollah, can they tell us how they will disarm the party,"" Aoun told supporters Friday. ""Hezbollah's weapons will no longer be a problem when the causes behind its existence disappear, including the borders' issues."" A close look at Lebanon's political landscape reveals that the country's Christian voters are split on how they will cast their ballots. Some Christian voters want their representatives to step out of the shadows of Hezbollah and Saad Hariri, who leads the Sunni-dominated ""March 14 coalition."" Christian voters are divided between supporting Aoun and other Christian leaders who want Hezbollah to disarm. ""In these elections, Christians look more divided than ever while others seem more unified than ever,"" said Shibley Telhami, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. For the Obama administration, the elections could be indicative of the president's odds of pushing stability in the region. Former U.S. President and Nobel Peace Prize Winner Jimmy Carter said the United States should work with whichever coalition wins. Carter was in Beirut as part of more than 200 international observers monitoring the election. He also oversaw balloting in Gaza during the elections in the Palestinian territory in January 2006. The Palestinian militant group Hamas won that race ""fairly and squarely"" by a huge margin, Carter said. The United States and Israel later refused to recognize the legitimacy of the Hamas win. ""And it's resulted in a split in the Palestinians and a very difficult situation there,"" Carter added. ""I think they (the United States) learned a hard lesson that they should accept the results of an election."" Two senior Obama administration officials -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden -- have visited Lebanon in recent months, signaling concerns with a possible Hezbollah victory. During his trip to Beirut two weeks ago, Biden warned the country that while the United States supports Lebanon's democratic process, it will reconsider its assistance to the country if its next government strays from certain ""fundamental principles."" Biden's visit followed Clinton's April trip to Beirut in which she called for an ""open and free"" election without outside interference -- a veiled reference to Iran and Syria. Such rhetoric has been dismissed by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as ""meddling."" The Hezbollah leader has been increasingly vocal in the lead-up to the election, blasting the current government as powerless. However, part of the reason Lebanon's government is crippled is that it made concessions to Hezbollah -- including giving them veto power -- in order to end a political stalemate that boiled over into violence of historic proportions last year. While some analysts are concerned Hezbollah could gain more control over Lebanon's government after Sunday's vote, a key Lebanese politician, Dori Chamoun, warned that assessment may be misleading. Chamoun, who opposes the March 8 alliance, said talk of Hezbollah's possible victory may be based on ""rumors"" and propaganda being spread by the Shiite militia and their political allies. ""They (Hezbollah) think they can scare many but no one is scared,"" Chamoun told CNN. ""They can spread all kinds of rumors on their four TV stations saying that they will win this upcoming elections."" Chamoun, whose father, Camille Chamoun, was Lebanon's president in the 1950s, is running for a seat in parliament. Even if a Hezbollah-dominated government does move in, it could have trouble working with Christian and Sunni Muslim politicians who -- under Lebanese law -- must participate in the government. It would also be difficult to find a Sunni political figure willing to serve as prime minister in a Hezbollah-led government since the majority of Lebanon's prominent Sunni politicians are aligned with Hariri's March 14 coalition, which has declared it will not participate in any government if Hezbollah wins. Lebanon's political landscape could be shifting after a similar shift in neighboring Israel. Voters in the Jewish state overwhelmingly supported conservative parties over more moderate groups, bringing into power Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this year. Netanyahu is viewed in the Arab world as more hawkish than his predecessor, Ehud Olmert, who ordered the war against Hezbollah in 2006. A Hezbollah victory in Lebanon could further inflame tensions with Israel, particularly with an estimated 30,000 rockets pointed at Israel from southern Lebanon -- all under the control of Hezbollah.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- The Mexican navy said Wednesday that it rescued five Ecuadorians who had been adrift without supplies in a fishing boat for more than two weeks off the coast of the southern state of Chiapas. Mexican medical personel examine two of five Ecuadorians rescued at sea. Mexican authorities initiated the rescue, which occurred Tuesday, after the U.S. Coast Guard alerted them that sailors aboard a fishing boat located 45 nautical miles (83 km) southeast of Port Chiapas had signaled to a passing plane that they needed help. The Mexican navy dispatched a helicopter, which located the 15-meter-long (49-foot-long) vessel and carried out the rescue by air, the navy said in a news release. The five aboard identified themselves as Jaime Arturo Alaba Chavez, the 35-year-old captain; VÃ­ctor Hugo Alaba Chavez, the 32-year-old cook; Edison Prado Alaba, a 27-year-old sailor; Carlos Cheme Vazquez, a 37-year-old sailor; and Raul Contreras Vera, a 64-year-old machinist. The sailors were taken to the Naval Sanatorium of Puerto Chiapas, where doctors determined they were dehydrated. They said they had departed Costa Rica's on May 6 but, five days later, their motor stopped working and, unable to repair it, they had been adrift and without food since. A naval patrol boat towed the boat to Puerto Chiapas, arriving there Wednesday morning. It will be inspected to rule out the possibility that it may have been used for illicit activities, the navy said.","The Mexican navy said Wednesday that it rescued five Ecuadorians adrift at sea .

"(CNN) -- ""Wolverine."" ""Star Trek."" ""Angels & Demons."" ""Terminator: Salvation."" The summer movies roll out, one weekend after another, like dreadnoughts leaving port to bombard a battle-scarred ocean. Mark Ruffalo and Adrien Brody star as ""The Brothers Bloom,"" a pair of successful con artists. So won't a little film about a pair of con-artist brothers, with nary an indestructible alloy in sight, get overrun by these blockbusters? Rian Johnson, the 35-year-old director of the charming ""The Brothers Bloom,"" doesn't see it that way. ""I actually kind of like it,"" he says of the strategy of premiering his film during summer movie season. (""Bloom"" opens Friday in limited release and expands nationwide May 29.) ""I feel like we're scampering in between the feet of these giants."" Make no mistake, adds Johnson: ""I love the big summer movies."" But, he says, audiences will see the big movie of the week ""and then want something different. That's the advantage coming out in this season has."" ""Bloom"" has already proved itself nimble.  Watch the stars talk about ""Bloom"" Â» . The film started earning buzz at the Toronto Film Festival last September, and its distributor, Summit Entertainment, launched a shrewd marketing campaign by putting the first seven minutes on the Internet earlier this year. Johnson, who directed the critically acclaimed ""Brick"" -- a film noir set in a high school -- has been praised for another inventive mix of genres, combining the con-man film with a touch of screwball comedy, some international intrigue and more than a little whimsy. Mark Ruffalo, who stars as Stephen Bloom, the mastermind of the duo, describes ""Brothers Bloom"" as ""its own world."" ""What I loved about it was its tonal shifts,"" he says. ""It goes from broad, almost slapstick stuff to the brother story and a love story. It's not traditional in that sense."" The film follows Stephen Bloom and his brother, played by Adrien Brody, as they embark on one last con: an attempt to swindle a wealthy shut-in, Penelope Stamp, played by Rachel Weisz. Instead of being upset, Penelope is tickled by the new world before her and the opportunities for freedom, even as the younger Bloom (simply called ""Bloom"") wants to move on to something else. Johnson is nothing if not a student of film, and ""Bloom"" features references to other con-man works. ""Paper Moon,"" with its examination of character, was a favorite, says Johnson. There are also nods to ""The Sting,"" David Mamet's works, and even Agatha Christie. But, as Ruffalo says, ""Bloom"" exists in its own world. Though the film is set in the present day, the Blooms wear suits and hats as if they walked out of 1910. Much of the film was shot in the sunny byways of coastal Eastern Europe, with its weathered 19th-century resorts and glamorous Old World style. (The backdrop made the story ""much more real for all of us,"" says Johnson.) Add Johnson's invocations of Fellini's ""8Â½,"" Marcello Mastroianni and (of all things) the Band documentary ""The Last Waltz"" to his cast, and Ruffalo says it was easy to find the film's personality. ""That was the starting point -- a threadbare elegance,"" he says. ""There's an appreciation of eccentricity,"" agrees Johnson. Whimsy can be hard to maintain, he says, but ""the heightened style comes from a story-based place."" (Johnson wrote the film's script.) That can be a lot for the moviegoing public of today -- weaned on CGI, armored rogues and thin romantic comedies -- to take in. But Johnson says he has faith ""The Brothers Bloom"" will find an audience. ""I'm pretty optimistic that with ... the ease with which media is now archived and made available to the public, I'm hoping that actually opens the doors for people to have more access to this stuff,"" he says. The director maintains a message board at rcjohnso.com, where young filmmakers ""constantly talk about older films,"" he says. In the film, Stephen Bloom says the perfect con is one in which ""everyone gets what they want."" Johnson (and his studio) hopes for a financial success, of course, but he couldn't be happier with the way ""The Brothers Bloom"" turned out. ""I learned so much doing this film,"" he says.

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- The mysterious disappearance of Flight AF 447 over the Atlantic Ocean has fueled speculation among aviation experts about what caused the state-of-the-art airliner to come down. An airliner is struck by lightning strike at Washington's Dulles airport last year. According to Air France CEO Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, the Airbus A330-200 encountered heavy turbulence about 02:15 a.m. local time Monday (10:15 p.m. ET Sunday), three hours after the jet carrying 228 people left Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for Paris, France. At that point, the plane's automatic system initiated a four-minute exchange of messages to the company's maintenance computers, indicating ""several pieces of aircraft equipment were at fault or had broken down."" The jet, which was flying at 35,000 feet and at 521 mph, also sent a warning that it had lost pressure, the Brazilian air force said. Its last known contact occurred at 02:33 a.m., the Brazilian air force spokesman added. The assumption is that these electrical problems led to a catastrophic failure of the aircraft's controls.  What brought Flight AF 447 down? Â» . Some experts have said that a lightning strike was a possibility, particularly since the plane disappeared in a storm-prone area along the equator known as the Intertropical Convergence zone (ITCZ). This is where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres converge. The intense sun and warm water of the equator heats the air in the ITCZ, raising its humidity and making it buoyant. Aided by the convergence of the trade winds, the buoyant air rises, releasing the accumulated moisture in an almost constant series of thunderstorms.  The airliner's route Â» . According to CNN's Mari Ramos, these storms can reach altitudes of 52,000 ft -- way beyond the capacity of commercial airliners to fly over.  Watch more about the weather systems Â» . Retired airline pilot John Cox told CNN that modern aircraft receive a constant stream of real time weather data which allows them to plot a course around storms. ""Because safety is the paramount concern, airliners don't fly into storms. They fly around them,"" he said. ""The ITCZ is no different. Planes fly through it every day. ""At 8 miles per minute, modern jets can easily fly around storms. Even if they encounter turbulence, they're designed to absorb it."" When lightning strikes a plane, the bolt typically hits a sharp part of it, such as a wing tip. Huge amounts of energy surge through the aircraft before exiting out of another sharp point, such as the tail. But sometimes high voltages can cause electrical damage if components are not well-grounded. Unlike other aircraft where the pilot's controls are manually attached to the flaps and rudders, Airbus 330 airliners are equipped with a ""fly by wire"" system that sends electronic signals from an onboard computer to move key control surfaces. Experts say that it is possible for this system and its back-up computers to be disabled by lightning. ""If you have a massive electrical problem it's possible that you could cut off all the commands out to the control surfaces,"" said aeronautics expert John Hansman. However, Kieran Daly, from the online aviation news service Air Transport Intelligence, told CNN that this scenario, while not impossible, is inconceivable. ""It's more likely that lightning would cause a fire or punch a hole through the aircraft structure,"" he said. ""It could be significant that the jet reported a loss of pressure."" He added that the aircraft would be able to continue without the fly-by-wire system. The ""trim tab,"" which enables the pilot to manually manipulate controls such as the rudder, would allow the crew to fly the aircraft safely. ""Pilots are routinely trained for these kinds of events in a simulator,"" he said. Former Airbus pilot John Wiley said on average every airliner is hit by a strike once a year. ""They don't go down,"" he said. According to Air France, the captain of Flight AF 447 had a record of 11,000 flight hours and had already flown 1,700 hours on Airbus A330/A340 aircraft. Of the two first officers, one had flown 3,000 flight hours (800 of which on the Airbus A330/A340) and the other 6,600 (2,600 on the Airbus A330/A340). The aircraft had totaled 18,870 flight hours and went into service on 18 April 2005. Its last maintenance check in the hangar took place on 16 April 2009.","Air France Airbus A330-200 encountered heavy turbulence .

"(CNN) -- While China is seriously cracking down on the exchange of virtual currencies for real cash, virtual economies backed by newfound legitimacy elsewhere are quickly gaining ground in the real world. There's gold in them there screens: Real-money transactions in virtual worlds are finding new legitimacy. On June 24, 2009, the role-playing game 140 Mafia launched on Twitter, following in the footsteps of highly lucrative games Mob Wars and Mafia Wars on Facebook (and now iPhone) to link virtual-currency exchanges to real-money transactions. In March 2009, MindArk -- creator of the MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) Entropia, where one player famously bought an island for US$26,500 in 2004 -- saw its wholly owned subsidiary Mind Bank granted a banking license from the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority. The new license allows Mind Bank to be the first bank to directly incorporate real-money transactions with virtual-world activities. Selling virtual assets directly between players for real-world cash has been strictly prohibited by most game publishers, which find themselves looped out of the profits. What has been profitable in the meantime to some hardcore players of World of Warcraft and EverQuest (and other games) is ""gold farming"" -- accumulation of ""gold,"" weapons and other status symbols of a seasoned player -- followed by the online auction of such assets or user accounts. Since games publishers began policing eBay for this type of unauthorized activity, several Web sites such as PlayerAuctions have adopted a PayPal-like approach in order to broker the trading legally, acting as an open marketplace for player-to-player exchange of digital assets. Dual-currency economies . However younger games (often aimed at younger audiences) are ditching the conventional subscription-based model of the above games to adopt the ""freemium"" model, which lets users play for free, but allows them to enhance their experience by purchasing accessories or other premiums through micropayments. Frenzoo, a ""3D fashion game for girls"", is one game that has adopted this model. CEO Simon Newstead explains: ""The idea with dual currencies is that there is a paid currency [Gold Coins], which is paid for using real money and exchanged between sellers and buyers. In addition, there is a second currency -- a free or so-called 'earned' currency [Silver Coins] -- which is gained through activity and progression in the world or game."" ""In this way,"" he continues, ""the economy can recognize different forms of contribution, and in newer economies these can also be traded between each other. For example, people earning currency and selling it to people who have less time but have real money."" Mirrored economies . As one of the first successful virtual economies, Second Life's huge marketplace includes objects and services for sale, as well as a real estate market. In 2008, more than $100 million worth of the world's Linden dollars were bought and sold on Second Life's official LindeX exchange, according to its Web site. ""In Linden Exchange, the U.S. dollar part of the transaction is via PayPal, a well-known entity, so there's a certain amount of trust that comes with it,"" says Darrly Chang, co-founder of D&D Dogs, a two-man freelance venture that sells virtual dog pets and avatars to Second Life residents. Recently, however, business has slumped along with the real-world recession. ""We'll continue to see a proliferation of alternative currencies associated with specific platforms and communities, much as frequent-flier miles are associated with individual airlines or even networks of airlines,"" says Dan Jansen, CEO of Virtual Greats, which specializes in creating branded, copyrighted material for virtual worlds. ""In the longer term we may see a global standard for virtual currencies, but it will take some time."" Golden e-currency? James Turk, chairman of digital-gold company GoldMoney, agrees. ""But,"" he adds, ""inevitably digital gold currency will make significant inroads in global commerce because it lowers the cost of transacting with one another. Reducing transaction costs creates more opportunities for global commerce."" In March 2009, GoldMoney launched a dedicated iPhone application allowing its account holders to exchange gold and silver units within minutes. Putting a trendy iPhone application that allows people to manage their own digital gold on par with other popular banking applications branded by well-established banks brings e-currency a step closer to the modern mobile end-user. Furthermore, GoldMoney is firmly anchored to real-world assets and individuals, notably strictly forbidding anonymous accounts -- unlike the former incarnation of the pioneering company E-Gold, whose founder this month ends his six-month house arrest in Florida after pleading guilty to money laundering-related crimes. So how realistic is the prospect of a single, global, digital currency? ""It all comes down to trust,"" says senior economist Frederic Neumann. ""We trust the government to guarantee our 'virtual' money for real currency. [With digital gold] the gold standard is guaranteed by a private company. Governments already have several hundred years of sovereignty engrained in people's minds, so that trust is very difficult to establish.""","Entropia Universe's Mind Bank has been granted a real-money banking license .

"(Travel + Leisure) -- Stockholm has a reputation for being one of Europe's most expensive cities. T+L hits the streets of the fashionable capital and proves otherwise. Stockholm's Strommen River . 9:00 a.m. I plot my day over a complimentary breakfast of homemade yogurt and knÃ¤ckebrÃ¶d (crispy bread) at Hotel Anno 1647 (3 MariagrÃ¤nd; 46-8/442-1680), housed in a former tobacco and clothing factory in the hip island neighborhood of SÃ¶dermalm. My room ($170), No. 21, is small and peaceful, with rustic pine floors, an antique crystal chandelier, and, thankfully, blackout drapes -- essential in a city that gets 18 hours of sunlight a day in the summer. 10:00 a.m. The hotel is around the corner from GÃ¶tgatan, one of Stockholm's most seductive shopping strips. Though it feels a little early to start spending, I can't resist a jar of cloudberry honey ($6) from Iris Hantverk (37 GÃ¶tgatan; 46-8/641-9190), a store that specializes in handmade items by visually impaired artisans. I crave almost everything I see in DesignTorget (31 GÃ¶tgatan, 46-8/462-3520), which carries an eclectic range of accessories by Swedish designers, including hand-printed dish towels and colorful kids' toys. But I force myself to move along. 12:00 p.m. For lunch, I circle back to busy Slussen square -- Stockholm's answer to Grand Central. The main attraction here (besides a major subway stop) is the humble Nystekt StrÃ¶mming (fried herring) wagon, encircled by picnic tables crowded with locals on their lunch breaks. I sidle up and order the signature dish ($6.25) topped with a dollop of crÃ¨me fraÃ®che. From my bench, I can see the silhouette of Gamla Stan, the old section of the city just across the bridge. 1:00 p.m. Down along the harbor, a freckled blond girl at a candy cart snips off a sample of her salt licorice (free), a delicious flavor called HÃ¤xvrÃ¥l -- ""scream of the witch,"" she translates. After a short stroll past the steamboats and Baroque mansions of Ãstermalm, I arrive at the Vasamuseet (14 GalÃ¤rvarvsvÃ¤gen; 46-8/5195-4800), a maritime museum built around a meticulously reconstructed boat that was shipwrecked in the 17th century. I buy a ticket ($15) and explore the gigantic ship, feeling a little like an extra on the set of ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" 3:30 p.m. Risking museum burnout, I head to the galleries ($12.50 admission) of the Moderna Museet (Skeppsholmen; 46-8/5195-5200), designed by the Spanish architect Rafael Moneo, to see its collection of 20th-century European and American art. Here, I discover the contemporary Swedish painter Karin Mamma Andersson, whose lush, layered paintings look like dreamscapes. I also find one of the city's best photo ops -- the panoramic view of the port from the glass-walled museum cafÃ©. 5:00 p.m. I forgo a pricey taxi ride across the city in favor of an infinitely more charming and scenic walk toward Gamla Stan, which is touristy but irresistible once I'm weaving through a knot of cobblestoned streets and storybook 17th-century houses. My reward is a hot chocolate ($4.70) at Kaffekoppen (18-20 Stortorget; 46-8/203-170), a candlelit cellar with tea-stained walls and low vaulted ceilings. 7:00 p.m. While wandering the alleys of Gamla Stan, I stumble upon what may be the city's top bargain: a classical music concert ($11) at Storkyrkan, Stockholm's central cathedral (1 Trangsund, Gamla Stan; 46-8/723-3016). I take a seat in a wooden pew as a local pianist fills the space with the music of Chopin. Dusky evening light filters in through leaded glass windows and shimmers off the golden angels on the high brick ceiling. Divine. 9:30 p.m. The lingering sunlight has affected my eating schedule, but I'm finally hungry again. On the patio of Babylon (4 BjÃ¶rns TrÃ¤dgÃ¥rdsgrÃ¤nd; 46-8/640-8083), surrounded by chattering clusters of young fashion plates and artist types, I wrap myself in one of the restaurant's green fleece blankets and gobble down a late dinner of potatoes and rÃ¶ding ($25.80), a local fish. From my barstool, I watch skinny blond skateboarders dip and sail around a cement half-pipe in the adjacent park, and revel in a priceless travel high: the giddy feeling of having discovered the coolest place in town.

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- A 16-year-old Hong Kong boy makes two phone calls for delivery: One for pizza, the other for the drug ketamine. Two teenage girls are found semi-conscious in a car park after overdosing on ketamine. A 13-year-old boy joins a gang and is given free ketamine. Glass capsules containing ketamine, which has become the drug of choice for Hong Kong's youth. These are anecdotes told to CNN by police, a family doctor and a former gang member. Ketamine has become the drug of choice among young people, as the number of people under 21 taking drugs has surged 57 percent in the last four years in Hong Kong, said Commissioner for Narcotics, Sally Wong. ""We started off with a very small number of young people taking drugs. We are now more worried about the trend,"" Wong said. ""We don't want a runaway trend; that's why we are stepping up action."" Ketamine, an animal tranquilizer, can put users in a dazed stupor for about two hours, doctors said. Long-term use of ketamine can impair cognitive function and damage internal organs.  Watch Pauline Chiou's report on ketamine sweeping Hong Kong Â» . An oversupply of the drug in Hong Kong and the fact that it is cheaper than other narcotics makes ketamine popular with young people, said Superintendent Wilson Fok of the Hong Kong Police Narcotics Bureau. One gram of ketamine sells on the street here for $13 and is enough to be shared with two other people, while cocaine, for example, sells for $103 a gram, Fok said. The drug is legal for medical use, but it is trafficked into Hong Kong from other parts of Asia, such as India and mainland China, and sold on the streets illegally, Fok said. Police have recently stepped up their efforts to crack down on drug use at clubs and bars in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, a city in mainland China just across the border. Nearly 120 alleged drug users from Hong Kong, mostly under the age of 30, were arrested at entertainment venues in Shenzhen in July and held for 15 days in sweeps that made headlines for days here. However, narcotics police said entertainment venues are not the only places they find drug abuse. ""Forty percent of young people abuse drugs in public toilets and playgrounds. That's what our recent data from last year shows,"" Fok said. ""They want to find some other places to take drugs."" The problem has gotten so bad that authorities have decided to do something never done here before: random school drug tests. Beginning in September, some two dozen schools will conduct tests, as part of a trial program. Officials say the drug screening will most likely be in the form of urine tests, though they are still working out the details. Ketamine can be detected in urine for at least three days, doctors said.  Watch a doctor explain how the test works Â» . Dr. Cheng Chi Man, a family practice doctor, runs a seminar that trains doctors to detect the signs of drug abuse in young patients: drowsiness, skin problems, frequent urination (ketamine can affect bladder function) and frequent sick leave. ""When we were 10 years old, we were still in primary school watching TV and eating candy. But they are now taking drugs."" Alman Chan, principal of Hong Kong's only drug rehab school for youth, the privately-run Christian Zheng Sheng School, said he has watched as drug use has grown.  See photos of the rehab school in remote Hong Kong Â» . ""Just look at our school development. I was here 14 years ago. At that time, I was the only teacher. I had 18 kids. I only had one student who was 15,"" he said. ""But now, I have one third -- about 40 of them -- who are 15 years old or younger. That shows you the number of students getting into drugs is bigger and also getting younger and younger."" There were a few reasons why children were getting involved with drugs, such as troubled homes and difficulties at school, he said. ""People are more concerned about material things and they are getting lost,"" he added. Hong Kong Police have arrested children as young as age 13 for drug offenses, according to Commissioner for Narcotics, Sally Wong. Police last week reportedly busted a network that allegedly recruited teenagers to sell illegal drugs-- mainly to students. One of those arrested -- a 14-year-old school dropout -- was found with 28 grams of ketamine, according to the South China Morning Post. But ketamine abuse is not limited to young people. It is the second-most popular drug among all age groups in Hong Kong, Superintendent Wilson Fok of the Hong Kong Police Narcotics Bureau said. Many young drug abusers end up in Alman Chan's drug rehab school for youth, which is located in a remote part of Lantau Island west of Hong Kong. CNN visited the campus, which is home to 99 boys and 24 girls. The closest road is a three-hour hike through the woods. Chan calls the school ""the last stop before jail"" for drug abusers. That was the case for Tai Ming Hung's son Keith, a former gang member. She learned he was using ketamine when he ended up in the hospital after taking the drug a few years ago. ""I was in denial. I just didn't believe it was true. When I first heard about it, we all didn't know how to react, because we hadn't heard of those drugs before,"" she said. ""I didn't really understand why we have these harmful drugs in the world. And I was so afraid that it would kill my son."" 18-year-old Keith, who said he began using ketamine at the age of 13 when he joined a gang, has recovered and is now living at Chan's school. ""I have a feeling that he's really growing up, he keeps improving,"" his mother said. The school's curriculum involves regular school subjects and chores. The goal is for each student to finish their court probation and either sit for the university exam or continue on to a vocational school. Many of the students have become interested in video editing and photography. There is a video lab on campus and the students showed CNN some video projects they have done. Other students run a pizza parlor and tea shop on a neighboring island. The average stay at the school is three years and students are encouraged to plan for life after rehab. ""We have vocational training. We help them get some marketable skills; therefore, they may get a job or continue training afterward,"" Chan said. ""I believe everyone deserves a second chance.""","Police: Ketamine is the top drug of choice among young people in Hong Kong .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- While the coroner's report on what killed Michael Jackson has been delayed indefinitely, new evidence emerged that the singer shopped for a doctor who would give him the drug investigators suspect led to his death. A doctor of Michael Jackson says he prescribed drugs to the alias Omar Arnold. Dr. Allan Metzger, whose name appeared on a search warrant served this week, refused Jackson's request in April for the anesthetic propofol -- commonly known by the brand name Diprivan, Metzger's attorney said. Investigators suspect another physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, gave the drug to Jackson in the 24 hours before he died, according to a source, who asked not to be named because the individual was not authorized to speak to the news media. Metzger, who practices in West Hollywood, California, told Jackson during a visit to his Holmby Hills home that the drug was ""dangerous and potentially life-threatening and could not be used outside of a hospital,"" attorney Harland Braun said. Metzger's medical records for Jackson, whom he treated until 2003, have been given to the coroner, Braun said. He said Metzger prescribed drugs for Jackson under the alias Omar Arnold and Michael Jackson, which was not illegal since he used both names together. The doctor did that because he thought it was ""his duty to protect the privacy"" of his patient, Braun said. Omar Arnold is one of 19 aliases listed in the warrant used by Los Angeles police and federal drug agents Tuesday to search the Las Vegas, Nevada, office and home of Murray, a Texas-based cardiologist. The warrant also mentioned Cherilyn Lee, a nurse practitioner who treated Jackson earlier this year. Lee said Jackson begged her for propofol to help him get a good night's sleep. She said she refused, telling the pop star that if he took the medicine, he might never wake up. The same warrant, signed by a Las Vegas judge, implied that investigators suspected Jackson was a drug addict. Dr. Deepak Chopra said in a recent interview that when Jackson asked him for a narcotic, he told him absolutely no. ""I said to him, 'Michael, you're going to die one day from this,' "" Chopra said. During a world tour in the mid-'90s, sources close to Jackson told CNN, the pop star suffered from insomnia and traveled with an anesthesiologist who would ""take him down"" at night and then ""bring him back up."" According to a report on a 2004 Santa Barbara, California, police investigation, security guards in Jackson's inner circle said he traveled the country getting prescriptions from doctors. The Los Angeles County coroner, who must rule on the cause of Jackson's June 25 death, met Thursday with the Los Angeles District Attorney, who must decide if anyone will be prosecuted for his death. During the meeting, it was decided that an announcement of the coroner's findings would be delayed indefinitely, according to a source close to the investigation. An official in the coroner's office had previously indicated to reporters that the findings would be made public within days. Katherine Jackson goes to court Monday . Katherine Jackson's legal battle for some control of her son's estate returns to court Monday in front of the same judge who is expected to award her permanent guardianship of his children. Jackson's lawyers filed a petition Tuesday accusing the men who now control the estate of being ""intent on keeping her in the dark"" about deals they've made or are negotiating. Jackson lawyer Londell McMillan raised questions about ""a suspicious circle of relationships"" involving John Branca, the singer's longtime personal attorney, and John McClain, a music industry executive and longtime friend -- who were named executors in Jackson's will. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff gave Branca and McClain temporary control of the estate until Monday's hearing. In the Jackson lawyers' petition, they asked the judge to order Branca, McClain and others to answer questions under oath about their business agreements to determine if they are ""fit and able"" to administer the estate. They also served the men with a 19-page demand for documents. Branca has refused to let Katherine Jackson see Michael Jackson's contracts with AEG, the company that was organizing and promoting his planned concerts, unless she agrees to keep them confidential. Branca's lawyer argued in a court filing that he has no choice since the contracts have a provision requiring confidentiality. Branca's lawyers also argued that Jackson's demand for documents was too broad and burdensome. ""Such measures will not be necessary if Mrs. Jackson is appointed a co-executor of the estate,"" McMillan said. McMillan, in an interview with CBS on Thursday, estimated the Jackson estate was worth $2 billion, while the executors have estimated in court that its value is around $500 million. The will written in 2002 places all of Jackson's assets into a family trust benefiting his mother, his three children and unnamed charities. The judge is also expected Monday to finalize Katherine Jackson's guardianship of her son's three children. An agreement between Jackson and Debbie Rowe, the mother of the two eldest children, cleared the way for an uncontested custody hearing. Rowe, who was briefly married to Michael Jackson, agreed not to fight for custody in exchange for visits with the children as recommended by a psychologist. The agreement does not involve any financial payments to Rowe ""apart from the continuation of spousal support payments"" that Michael Jackson personally agreed to make to Rowe after their divorce, their lawyers said in a joint statement. Jackson's children have been living with their paternal grandmother at her Encino, California, home since their father's death. The eldest child, Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., was born in February 1997. A daughter, Paris Michael Katherine Jackson, was born the next year. Details of how the children were conceived -- and who was the biological father -- have been closely guarded amid much public speculation. The couple divorced in 1999 with Rowe giving Jackson full custody while she got an $8.5 million settlement, according to court documents. Jackson later agreed to additional support. Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children. A California appeals court later ruled her rights were improperly terminated, opening the door to a possible custody battle.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Are you looking for an easy way to reduce your monthly budget? Look no further than your cell phone bill. Clark Howard says consider switching to a less known cell provider to save money and avoid signing contracts . If you're with one of the four big providers -- AT&T, Sprint, Verizon or T-Mobile -- you're almost certainly overpaying for service. In addition, all four have a business model that's based on cowardice. They've developed lousy, stinking, rotten two-year contracts because they're afraid to compete in the marketplace. Thankfully, there are a variety of smaller players in the market who offer nationwide coverage for less money with no contracts. Before considering any adjustment to your cell phone plan, you'll need to start by assessing how much you talk, text and surf the Web on your phone. Watch Clark discuss the pros and cons of bundling services . If you use less than 300 minutes per month, you'd probably do much better with a prepaid plan where you buy minutes as you need them. Net10.com is one service I usually recommend -- no roaming charges, no long distance charges, no monthly fees and a flat 10 cents per minute for calls. If you use more than 300 minutes per month and you travel from time to time, you might want to consider either Metro PCS or Cricket. Both have plans ranging from $25 to $50 and offer unlimited calling. The difference in price points is based on how many other features you want -- texting, Web surfing and so on. But there are never any contracts or overages. For heavy cell phone users, there are Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile. Both are engaged in an all-out price war that can directly benefit you. Virgin Mobile is offering $49.99 per month unlimited calling -- no roaming charges and no contract. If you want texting, you'll pay an additional $10 per month for unlimited service. If you want high-speed Internet, you'll pay another $10 per month on top of that for a 50MB plan. Boost Mobile's $50 per month plan already includes unlimited calling, texting and Web access. And that $50 even includes junk fees! One caveat here: Remember, my definition of ""cheap"" means that I'm willing to accept lower quality for a lower price. So consider this caveat carefully and do your own research before making any final decisions about your cell provider.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The case of Janet Jackson's ""wardrobe malfunction"" on national television -- and subsequent fines against CBS -- will be re-examined at the order of the Supreme Court. Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson perform at the Super Bowl just before the infamous ""wardrobe malfunction."" The justices Monday sent the case back to a federal appeals court in Philadelphia that had thrown out a $550,000 government fine against the broadcast network and its affiliates for airing the incident during halftime of the 2004 Super Bowl. The pop singer's breast was briefly exposed during a performance with singer Justin Timberlake. After viewer complaints and national media attention, the Federal Communications Commission said the Jackson incident was obscene. In addition to CBS Inc., 20 of its affiliates also were fined. Congress quickly reacted at the time to the visual shocker by increasing the limit on indecency fines tenfold, up to $325,000 per violation per network. And it said each local affiliate that aired such incidents also could be punished by the same amount. But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded the communications commission had acted ""arbitrarily and capriciously."" The Supreme Court's action marks the second time in recent days that it has dealt with cases involving broadcast standards. Last week, the justices narrowly upheld the authority of the Federal Communications Commission to punish networks for airing profanity. The government clampdown on obscene images and words began in 2003. Enforcement of the law, as well as fines and sanctions for the incidents, have been put on hold while the cases are being argued. The television networks say their scripted shows no longer air nudity, racy images or expletives, even after 10 p.m., when some potentially vulgar words are permitted. They worry, however, about unplanned, often spontaneous indecent or profane incident at live events, such as awards shows and sporting events. Company officials say such programs are often on a five-second delay, and censors are on hand to bleep any offensive language. But some indecent words can slip through, they admit, and they want to be protected from heavy government fines. Critics call that laughable. ""This past summer, CBS edited into a show that had to go through multiple reviews, by multiple people in the organization, the F-word,"" said Tim Winter, who heads the Parents Television Council, and is supporting the FCC's efforts. His group advocates ""responsible"" programming, and warns parents about questionable program content. The show in question was ""Big Brother 10,"" a taped series. The Jackson incident was not on a five-second delay. CBS issued a statement Monday afternoon it is confident that the appeals court ""will again recognize that the Super Bowl incident, while inappropriate and regrettable, was not and could not have been anticipated by CBS."" The issue is an important one ""for the entire broadcasting industry,"" it said, ""because it recognizes that there are rare instances, particularly during live programming, when despite best efforts it may not be possible to block unfortunate fleeting material."" In the case involving profane language, the high court concluded 5-4 that the communications commission has the authority to sanction broadcast TV networks that air isolated incidents of profanity, known as ""fleeting expletives."" But the justices in that case refused to decide whether the commission's policy violates the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. It ruled only on their enforcement power. The justices ordered the free-speech aspect to be reviewed again by a federal appeals court. The ""wardrobe malfunction"" case is FCC v. CBS Corp. (08-653).","U.S. Supreme Court has asked that ""wardrobe malfunction"" case be re-examined .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a resolution Friday that says it supports ""all Iranians who embrace the values of freedom, human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law."" Throngs in Tehran cheer Thursday for defeated presidential candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, center. The resolution was approved by 405 lawmakers, while one -- Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas -- voted against it. Two others, Reps. Brad Ellsworth, D-Indiana, and Dave Loebsack, D-Iowa, voted ""present."" In a statement on his Web site, Paul said he voted against the measure because he is ""always very cautious about 'condemning' the actions of governments overseas."" ""I have always hesitated when my colleagues rush to pronounce final judgment on events thousands of miles away about which we know very little,"" said Paul, who attracted attention last year during his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination. ""And we know very little beyond limited press reports about what is happening in Iran."" The resolution, which also ""condemns the ongoing violence against demonstrators,"" was sponsored by Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman, D-California, and two Republicans, Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana and House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia. Speaking shortly after the resolution passed, Pence called it a message from Americans to the Iranian people. ""As Americans have done throughout our history, this Congress today, on behalf of the American people, has spoken a word of heartfelt support to all Iranian citizens who embrace the values of freedom, human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law,"" he said. He urged U.S. senators to support the identical resolution that Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, introduced Friday. Both Pence and McCain have been outspoken in their criticism of President Obama's response to massive rallies in Iran against the results of last week's presidential election.  Watch as Obama walks a fine line Â» . Supporters of Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi have taken to the streets this week calling for a new election after the results of the June 12 vote showed an overwhelming victory for hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The rallies also have denounced the Iranian government's crackdown on the protests in which at least eight people have died. Obama has said he is ""deeply troubled"" by the violence, but he has avoided siding with Ahmadinejad's opponents, telling reporters, ""It is up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran's leaders will be."" ""It's not productive, given the history of U.S.-Iranian relations, to be seen as meddling, the U.S. president meddling in Iranian elections,"" Obama said this week. But several Republicans, particularly McCain -- Obama's opponent in last year's presidential race -- have criticized the administration's position. McCain introduced a resolution on the Senate floor Friday morning that he said would be ""an expression of support by the government and the people of the United States of America"" for those protesting the election results. ""It is unfortunate in a way that this resolution is required since the administration does not want to 'meddle' and has refused, the president has refused to speak out in support of these brave Iranian citizens, most of them young, who are risking their very lives to protest what was clearly an unfair and corrupt election,"" McCain told his fellow senators.  Watch what else McCain said about Obama Â» . The resolution passed Friday states that the House: . On Thursday, Cantor joined the critics of the White House, saying the United States has a ""moral responsibility"" to condemn attacks on protesters. ""The administration's position that what's going on in Iran is a 'vigorous debate' is absurd,"" he said. ""People are being brutalized and murdered by the regime in Tehran. We have no idea exactly how many have died or have been seriously injured since the regime has restricted journalists. In no way do these actions constitute a 'vigorous debate.' "" Cantor, the No. 2 Republican in the House, added, ""America has a moral responsibility to stand up for these brave people, to defend human rights and to condemn the violence and abuses by the regime in Tehran.""  Watch amateur video of protesters under attack Â» . Pence has called on the United States ""to take a half-step back from this administration's olive branch and the apology approach to enemies and countries that have been hostile to the United States of America and our allies, particularly with the road to Iran."" But Sen. John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Washington would be making an ""enormous mistake"" by taking sides in the Iranian protests. ""There is no need for the United States of America to step into the middle of it and make this about America,"" Kerry told CNN's ""The Situation Room With Wolf Blitzer."" ""It is an Iranian moment, spurred on by Iranians, thoroughly supported by Iranians to the degree that the supreme ayatollah has now backed off his own support for the elections [and] called for an investigation,"" he said. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs defended the administration's approach this week, saying that Obama ""believes that he's struck the right tone."" ""I know some people agree with what Sen. McCain said. Some people agree with what other Republicans have said that's very much like the president's position,"" Gibbs said Thursday. ""The president strongly believes that we should -- and have -- spoken out to ensure the demonstrators have the universal right and principle to demonstrate without fear of harm. But at the same time, we have to respect their sovereignty."" Moorhead Kennedy, a former diplomat who was among those taken hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979, said he supports the Obama administration's position. ""I think if I had any conclusion to draw, we would have been much better off not interfering in Iran now,"" Kennedy told CNN's ""American Morning."" Because the United States backed a 1953 coup that put Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in charge, and supported him until the 1979 revolution that created today's Islamic republic, Kennedy said, ""There are a great many resentments there.""

"CLOVIS, California (CNN) -- Jeff Hubbard fought back tears as he talked about his boy -- a ""great, great young man"" who was killed last week in Iraq in a helicopter crash. It's the second time he's had to bury a son killed in the Iraq war. Jeff and Peggy Hubbard with sons  Army Spc. Jason Hubbard, left, and Cpl. Nathan Hubbard. This time, it was made even more tragic. His third son, also a soldier in Iraq, was immediately on the scene of last week's helicopter crash and watched as soldiers carried the remains of his brother, 21-year-old Army Cpl. Nathan Hubbard, from the crash site. Nathan's flag-draped coffin arrived in Fresno earlier this week and eventually to his hometown of Clovis.  Watch ""We love you Nate"" Â» . Hundreds of mourners gathered Friday to remember Nathan at St. Anthony of Padua, the same church where his oldest brother's funeral was held in 2004. Nathan will be laid to rest at Clovis Cemetery, beside his brother, Jared. Nathan and his other brother entered the military shortly after Jared was killed -- to honor his sacrifice. ""Their decision to join the military was motivated by a love for their brother and a desire to serve their country,"" the priest told mourners Friday. ""The death of Jared touched him deeply. Losing a brother and a friend made a profound impact on him, and brought to his attention the seasons of war and grief and loss."" Jeff Hubbard spoke to reporters Thursday ahead of the funeral, struggling to find words to describe how much his youngest son meant to him and his family. ""I want everybody to remember and celebrate Nate in their own way, the way they want,"" he said. ""We want him honored, remembered and celebrated -- he was a great, great young man. Wonderful young man."" Tragically, the Hubbards have gone through this anguish before. In 2004 their son, Marine Lance Cpl. Jared Hubbard, was on patrol in Iraq with his best friend and fellow Marine, Jeremiah Baro -- also from Clovis -- when a roadside bomb exploded, killing both. Jeff Hubbard says there's no way for a parent to prepare for the agony a second time. ""They're each absolutely individual terrible instances that you deal with the best you can as you go forward,"" he said. Six months after Jared was killed, Nathan and Jason Hubbard decided to enlist and serve together -- to follow in their brother's footsteps. On August 22 after returning from a scouting mission south of Kirkuk, Iraq, the Blackhawk helicopter carrying Nathan and 13 other soldiers crashed. Jason, who served in the same Army platoon, was in a separate helicopter when his brother went down and was ordered to secure the crash site. When he and his men reached the downed Blackhawk, Jason says he realized it was his brother's unit. ""We also had to remove as many of the men as we could out of that helicopter,"" Jason remembered. ""And I couldn't participate in that. I knew my -- I knew Nathan was in there. I tried several times to kind of gather myself, but I just -- I couldn't."" Jason says as the men carried bodies out of the wreckage, he spotted his younger brother. ""At one point they did carry Nathan by me. And that's when the reality, the complete reality, and complete understanding of the situation came to me and I began dealing with it."" Under the Department of Defense sole survivor policy, Jason says he was told he will not be allowed to return to war. His wife and young son will join him at his base in Hawaii.

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Scientific tests prove bones housed in the Basilica of St. Paul in Rome are those of the apostle St. Paul himself, according to Pope Benedict XVI. Pope Benedict XVI looks at the tomb of St. Paul at the Basilica of St. Paul in Rome in 2007. ""Tiny fragments of bone"" in the sarcophagus were subjected to carbon dating, showing they ""belong to someone who lived in the first or second century,"" the pope said in a homily carried on Italian television. ""This seems to confirm the unanimous and undisputed tradition that these are the mortal remains of the Apostle St. Paul,"" Benedict said in Sunday's announcement. The tomb also holds ""traces of a precious linen cloth, purple in color and laminated with pure gold, and a blue colored textile with linen filaments,"" the pope said. The tests were carried out by inserting a probe into a small opening in the sarcophagus, ""which had not been opened for many centuries,"" the pontiff said. The probe ""also revealed the presence of grains of red incense and traces of protein and limestone."" Separately, archaeologists have uncovered an image of St. Paul which ""could be considered the oldest icon of the apostle known to date,"" the Vatican's official newspaper reported Sunday. The painting, in the St. Tecla Catacomb, is ""among the oldest and best-defined figures from ancient Christianity,"" according to the Pontifical Commission for Sacred Archaeology, L'Osservatore Romano reported. St. Paul is one of the most significant figures in Christianity. Originally a persecutor of early Christians, he became a follower of Jesus after seeing a vision on the road to Damascus, according to Christian tradition. ""Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"" the vision of Jesus asks Paul, using the apostle's birth name, in the Acts of the Apostles. Saul then took the name Paul and became a missionary. His letters, or epistles, to early Christian communities around the Mediterranean form a significant portion of the New Testament. Paul was beheaded by Roman authorities sometime between 65 and 67 A.D., according to the Catholic Church. He was buried a few miles away, and when the Roman Empire stopped persecuting Christians some 250 years later, the Emperor Constantine had a basilica built over his grave. It currently lies under a marble tombstone bearing the Latin inscription PAULO APOSTOLO MART (Apostle Paul, martyr), according to the Web site of the basilica. A papal altar stands over the tombstone, which is visible through a window-like opening, the Web site says. Monday marks the end of a year of celebration in honor of the 2,000th anniversary of St. Paul's birth. It also happens to be the feast day of Saints Peter and Paul.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The U.S. Open has a reputation for testing the world's best golfers with the most demanding courses. The 2002 US Open at Bethpage Black featured punishing rough and heavy rain. The competition is designed to challenge, traditionally favoring courses that feature brutal rough and narrow fairways. This year's U.S. Open is no exception, taking place at Bethpage Black in Long Island, New York, widely regarded as one of the toughest courses in the game. The U.S. Open was first staged at Bethpage in 2002, when it became the first municipal course to host the competition and, at 7,214 yards, the longest course in the competition's history. Those who played at Bethpage 2002 still have the scars to prove it. Heavy rain and swirling wind turned the event into an endurance contest. It was survival of the fittest, with Tiger Woods the only competitor to finish under par, ending the tournament three under. Those brave enough to return to Bethpage on Thursday will find there have been a few changes. For starters, the course has been lengthened by 200 yards, which will make the grueling course even more exhausting. More welcome will be the introduction of ""graduated"" primary rough. That means there will be a strip of intermediate rough next to the fairway, and beyond that there a strip of primary rough approximately two-and-a-half to three inches deep, followed by a second cut of rough, which will be about four to six inches deep and stretch to the gallery rope lines. The idea is to penalize narrow misses less severely than big misses: a player who hits his shot slightly off target will land in the shorter cut of rough, an easier shot than the longer second cut. See our choice of 10 golfers to watch at the U.S. Open. Â» . Mike Davis, senior director of rules and competitions for the United States Golf Association, has said the course will be structurally very similar to 2002, but there will be more ""risk and reward"" opportunities. That means there are more holes where golfers can choose to gamble from the tee. A well-executed drive will save strokes and a misplaced drive could cost them dear. The sheer length of the course is likely to favor the game's big hitters. That includes the likes of Tiger Woods, the golfer who most successfully tamed Bethpage in 2002. Woods also showed his big-course credentials by winning last year's U.S. Open at Torrey Pines, which topped Bethpage with its 7,643-yard course. The distance the golfers have to cover will probably favor those in good physical condition. But the size of Bethpage is not the only thing that will decide the contest. Graduated or not, the rough will be a real problem, making accurate driving a necessity. Phil Mickelson will go into the tournament as one of the favorites, but he will need to be precise from the tee, not one of his strong points. Patience will be a virtue. The fact that it is such a tough course means competitors will have to accept that they will not be able to get under par on many of the holes. On the other hand those new ""risk and reward"" holes will give gamblers the opportunity to throw caution to the wind if they are falling off the pace. The golfers and spectators will no doubt be hoping for better weather than in 2002, but even in glorious sunshine, it will still be the kind of tournament that separates the men from the boys. U.S. golfer John Daly failed to qualify for the U.S. Open last week, but he was full of praise for the course, saying ""I love Bethpage. It's the ultimate major course. It's fair. It's so hard they really can't make it any harder.""","The U.S. Open is known for testing golfers with the most demanding courses .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A distraught, sobbing Afghan Taliban member begged the court for mercy, but got none as an unmoved federal judge here Monday handed down maximum life sentences for convictions on drug trafficking and narco-terrorism charges. A guard watches over a pile of burning drugs in Kabul, Afghanistan, on June 25, 2008. Khan Mohammed, 38, of Nangarhar Province became the first person convicted and sentenced in the United States under a 2006 law that increased the penalty for a defendant found to be involved  with terrorism and distributing illegal drugs. Mohammed, who had been extradited from Afghanistan, was convicted by a jury in May of plotting a rocket attack on U.S. military forces and Afghan civilians at Jalalabad Airfield. He also was found guilty of distributing between $1 million and $3 million worth of heroin into the United States ""to kill Americans as part of a jihad."" Mohammed's court-appointed lawyer, conceding that ""what he did was wrong,"" urged U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly to be lenient and sentence his client to only 20 years in prison. Then the full-bearded Mohammed, dressed in an orange jailhouse jumpsuit, addressed the judge. With tears streaming down his face, and choking back his words, he begged for only one or two years. ""I have little children and a woman. They depend on me,"" Mohammed began. ""I'm so worried about them."" His lengthy emotional appeal went on to include his reason for selling opium. ""In my village that's how you have to make a living. There is no house there without opium,"" he said. Justice Department prosecutor Matthew Stiglitz, however, urged the court to ""send a message of deterrence,"" and warned against ""the confluence of drug trafficking and terrorism."" ""No, he's not the Osama bin Laden of terrorism. No, he's not the Pablo Escobar of the drug world,"" Stiglitz told the judge. ""But this is where the rubber meets the road."" Bin Laden is the head of al Qaeda, while Escobar, who died in 1993, was the most powerful of Colombian drug lords. ""Afghanistan is ground zero for opium, and an almost limitless source of funds to the Taliban,"" he argued. Kollar-Kotelly agreed fully with the prosecutors, and strongly admonished the Taliban defendant. ""You were convicted 99 percent by your own words,"" the judge declared, as she recalled how a ""courageous"" Afghan police chief wore an undercover wire to record Mohammed's plotting. ""The fact that no one died is only because you didn't get the missiles you wanted,"" she said. ""In 2006, you celebrated the Americans' use of the opium. It was a jihad. You knew the damage it could cause,"" the judge continued. ""Because of your undiluted hatred for the United States, you might well have launched other attacks had you not been arrested."" She added, ""Terrorists stand unique among criminals. Deterrence is very important here."" Then, concluding dramatically, the judge turned directly to the defendant. ""I heard your concerns for your family but no acceptance of responsibility for your action,"" the judge said. ""Defendants often express worry for their families, but if they considered the consequences of their actions beforehand, maybe they would have acted differently.""","Khan Mohammed convicted of plotting rocket attack, selling heroin .

"(CNN) -- The space shuttle Atlantis crew completed its first spacewalk to upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope, a daylong act of grueling labor that featured the replacement and installation of key instruments. Spacewalkers remove a camera from the Hubble on Thursday. Astronauts John Grunsfeld and Drew Feustel removed the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 and swapped it out with an updated model, a device that ""will allow the telescope to take large-scale, clear and detailed photos over a wide range of colors,"" NASA said. But they had a tough time removing a bolt in that task, an issue that caused some concern for colleagues on the ground. They eventually released it. ""OK, here we go. I think I got it. It turned. It turned. And it's turning easily now,"" Feustel said. ""Very nice."" In all, the repair mission took seven hours and 20 minutes, a hard day's work that ended at 4:12 p.m. EDT. ""It turned out very well,"" lead flight director Tony Ceccacci said during a NASA briefing. The team also replaced a Science Instrument Command and Data Handling Unit, a computer that ""sends commands to Hubble's science instruments and formats science data for transmission to the ground,"" NASA said. The team ""installed a soft capture mechanism, a device that will allow future vehicles to attach to the telescope,"" NASA said. And they installed ""a combination of locks and latches that will allow for faster opening and closing of the telescope doors during the third spacewalk."" ""This is a huge accomplishment,"" Preston Burch, Hubble Space Telescope program manager, said during a briefing. ""Our first EVA day in more than seven years."" EVA is the acronym for ""extravehicular activity,"" the phrase for spacewalking. It was the first of five spacewalks scheduled during the 11-day mission in which the crew will work in the shuttle's cargo bay to upgrade and repair Hubble. Astronauts Michael Good and Mike Massimino will perform the next spacewalk on Friday. They will be installing gyroscopes and batteries.  Learn more about the Hubble repairs Â» . The mission is one of the most ambitious space repair efforts ever attempted. Atlantis launched Monday afternoon for NASA's fifth and final repair visit to the telescope.  Watch Atlantis lift off on Hubble mission Â» . After a two-day chase, the shuttle captured the telescope Wednesday with its robotic arm some 350 miles above Earth and pulled it into Atlantis' cargo bay for service.  Watch Atlantis snag the Hubble Â» . It's been seven years since the last space shuttle crew worked on the telescope, which has been latched to a rotating, ""lazy Susan""-type device for five days of repairs and remodeling. A camera mounted on the shuttle's robotic arm, 200 feet from the telescope, is taking pictures of it -- the first time the telescope has been seen since March 2002. An umbilical line was connected to provide electricity from Atlantis to the telescope, according to NASA. Mission commander Scott Altman also will position the shuttle to allow Hubble's solar arrays to gather energy from the sun and recharge the telescope's batteries. The timeline for the spacewalks is so tight, there's a chance the astronauts won't get everything done, especially if they hit any snags. And that's a real possibility because some of the repairs they are attempting have never been tried before. NASA canceled an Atlantis mission to extend Hubble's operational life in January 2004 because the trip was considered too risky in the wake of the 2003 space shuttle Columbia disaster, which killed seven astronauts. That accident was blamed on a hole punched in the front of the wing by debris during liftoff. But public pressure and steps taken to increase shuttle safety led the space agency to reconsider. Hubble's ""greatest discoveries,"" NASA says, include determining the age of the universe -- 13.7 billion years, discovering that ""virtually all major galaxies have black holes at their center,"" and ""providing evidence that the speed at which the universe is expanding is accelerating -- caused by an unknown force that makes up for more than 75 percent of the universe.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Humza Ismail hasn't spent much time in Raleigh, North Carolina, since he started graduate school two years ago. But when he heard two former acquaintances were arrested on terrorism charges this week, he says, ""Honestly, I wasn't surprised."" Omar Aly Hassan, left, and Ziyad Yaghi were clear on where they stood on terrorism, an acquaintance said. Omar Aly Hassan, Ziyad Yaghi and five others are charged with conspiring to commit violent jihad overseas. An eighth suspect is still being sought, authorities have said. When he lived in Raleigh, Ismail worshipped at the same mosque as Hassan and Yaghi. When groups of young men talked there, Ismail says, the conversation often turned to religion and politics, and Hassan and Yaghi made it clear where they stood. ""When it came to something like suicide bombing, they would say, 'If it's a benefit for the Muslims then something like that can be permissible,' "" Ismail says. ""I could tell it was something they wanted to do."" But, he adds, ""They never indicated or said 'we are going to make jihad overseas.'"" Ismail says the duo spoke in glowing terms about Osama bin Laden, calling him a scholar and a mujahedeen. ""You could tell they were being influenced by somebody,"" Ismail says. He does not know by whom. He feels they were susceptible to a message of violence ""because it sounded cool and exciting."" Ismail says he strenuously disagreed with Yaghi and Hassan's views on terrorism even, he says, getting into a public shouting match with them at a restaurant. He says he told them, ""You can't do this, man. You can't say it is OK. ""That is corruption and terrorism and that is not permissible in Islam."" Ismail says he and others raised concerns about Hassan and Yaghi to officials at the Islamic Center of Raleigh, but were ""overlooked."" ""I did my part,"" Ismail says. Imran Aukhil, a spokesman for the Islamic Center of Raleigh, told CNN on Thursday that he had no information about complaints concerning Hassan and Yaghi. On Saturday, however, he informed CNN that he had researched the matter and learned there was a complaint several years ago against an individual at the mosque. Aukhil said he did not have the name of that person. ""It was reported to the FBI,"" said Aukhil. ""The FBI did take note of it in their investigation.""

"(CNN) -- Cell phone technology is helping developing nations prepare for disease threats such as a new strain of swine flu, an outbreak of measles or the increased spread of HIV. Workers in Kenya use EpiSurveyor for the first time nationwide during this year's children's health week. Kenya proved it in 2007, when the East African nation suffered its first case of the polio virus in more than 20 years, said Yusuf Ajack Ibrahim, a health care worker at the Kenyan Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation. As thousands of Somalis fled to Kenya to avoid violence in their homeland, the exodus sparked a serious health crisis, Ibrahim said. ""One case of confirmed wild polio virus put at risk the lives of 100,000 children,"" he said. Kenyan health officials determined that they needed a way to quickly survey and assess the situation and initiate a massive immunization campaign. The solution was on the Internet, where they found a free, open-source application designed for personal digital assistants, called EpiSurveyor. Open-source software is posted online for anyone to use and alter to suit their needs. Downloading the software to cell phones enabled officials to gather data directly from the site of the outbreak and send it electronically back to headquarters for faster analysis. This cuts down on the time officials have to spend collecting paper surveys and analyzing them individually before they can begin treating people. ""The information gave us useful feedback not only on the affected area but on the neighboring ones as well and helped us put plans and measures in place to stop the spread of the virus,"" Ibrahim added. Physician and epidemiologist Dr. Joel Selanikio predicts that within a year, health officials will be using the technology to track other threats in developing nations, such as the recent Mexican swine flu outbreak. Selanikio invented EpiSurveyor in 2003, after he and American Red Cross technologist Rose Donna began searching for a more efficient way to gather data on immerging diseases. They started a nonprofit organization, DataDyne, aiming to use mobile devices to efficiently and immediately gather public health information. ""Collecting data on paper and then taking two years to enter the data is a tremendous drain and barrier to good public health,"" said Selanikio, who teaches pediatrics at Washington's Georgetown University Hospital. Mobile devices such as PDAs or handheld computers have been used for field studies since the late 1990s, but electronic survey methods have traditionally been expensive, labor-intensive and challenging to implement on a global scale. Many global health institutions are now encouraging the use of advanced methodologies such as smart phones and open-source software as the next generation of data transmission, said Dr. Ramesh Krishnamurthy, an informatics scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. EpiSurveyor frees health care workers from hiring programmers to create electronic surveys. Data gatherers can customize their questionnaires online, download the questionnaires onto a cell phone that has Internet capability, poll patients and do direct analysis, all through a touch pad on a cell phone. Ibrahim credits the technology with saving Zambians who were threatened by a frightening outbreak of measles in 2007. The government didn't know that vaccine supplies were low, he said. Using EpiSurveyor, health care workers discovered that 60 percent of their vaccine stockpiles in remote areas were missing. They mobilized a response within three weeks, he said. ""Imagine if we have an outbreak of measles and the information is relayed to us three months after the outbreak. By the time we respond, lives would have been lost, but if we can get the information in a day or half a day, we an mount a quick response,"" Ibrahim said. ""By being able to relay the information at an appropriate time, that -- in and of itself -- is life-saving,"" he added. Fans point out that EpiSurveyor's success hinges on ready access to technology already in place. ""There are 4 billion mobile phones in the world; 2.2 billion of those are in the developing world,"" said Claire Thwaites, who heads a partnership between the United Nations Foundation and the Vodafone Foundation, which funded EpiSurveyor. Sixty-four percent of all mobile phone users live in the developing world, according to a U.N. estimate. By 2012, the U.N. believes, half of all residents in remote areas of the world will have mobile phones. Compare mobile ubiquity to the 305 million PCs or 11 million hospital beds in the developing world, Thwaites said. The potential for mobile technology to help manage health care is huge, she said. With the help of the U.N.'s World Health Organization and government health officials in more than 20 African countries, more than 800 health care workers are now trained to use this cell phone software, revolutionizing the way health care data can be collected, monitored and assessed.","Disease-control software in cell phones is touted as boon to global public health .

"WICHITA, Kansas (CNN)  -- Kansas prosecutors have brought murder and assault charges against the man suspected of killing Wichita physician George Tiller, whose women's clinic was a frequent target of protests against abortion. Scott Roeder, 51, is being held on a first-degree murder charge and two counts of aggravated assault. Scott Roeder, 51, is being held without bail on a first-degree murder charge and two counts of aggravated assault stemming from Tiller's shooting death Sunday morning, Sedgwick County District Judge Ben Burgess said. Burgess set a preliminary hearing in the case for June 16. Police have not disclosed a possible motive in Tiller's killing, but associates said Roeder was a regular among the anti-abortion protesters who routinely gathered at his Wichita clinic, Women's Health Care Services. Tiller, 67, was one of the few U.S. doctors who performed late-term abortions, and he had survived one attempt on his life before being gunned down in his church Sunday morning. Prosecutors will not seek the death penalty ""under the facts and circumstances that are known at this time,"" District Attorney Nola Foulston said.  Watch the district attorney explain the charges Â» . Kansas state law allows the death penalty only in certain circumstances, such as multiple killings, contract killings, the deaths of police officers or jailers, or a slaying that takes place during a sexual assault. Roeder was in the county jail during his brief initial court appearance and appeared in court via video. He requested a court-appointed lawyer during the hearing, during which he was dressed in maroon jail coveralls and appeared to fidget.  Watch scenes from court Tuesday Â» . Burgess ordered Roeder to have no contact with witnesses or Tiller's family. Since Tiller's death, supporters have left a few bouquets of flowers outside his clinic. The architecture of the low-slung, windowless concrete building -- which is fenced off, monitored by cameras and separated from buildings behind it by a moat-like ditch -- reflected the threats he faced for nearly two decades. In a statement issued Tuesday, Tiller's family said they hope his ""valuable work"" will go on, ""but there have been no final decisions made about the long-term plans for the medical practice."" ""There is currently no plan to immediately reopen the clinic and no patients are being scheduled at this time. The Tiller family's focus, of course, is to determine what is in the best interests of the employees and the patients,"" the statement read. Dr. Leroy Carhart, a Nebraska physician who also practices at Tiller's clinic, said at his suburban Omaha office that he left a Monday meeting in Wichita with the belief that the practice would reopen ""in the very near future."" But he said, ""At the present time, there's no known future."" Carhart was the plaintiff who challenged a federal ban on a type of late-term procedure that opponents labeled ""partial-birth"" abortion. The Supreme Court upheld the ban in 2006. Tiller practiced medicine for nearly 40 years. Most of his patients were grappling with pregnancies that were ""fatally or catastrophically complicated by medical problems,"" Dr. Warren Hern, a Colorado physician and a friend, said on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""The many women who come for late abortions, in fact, have desperate circumstances with a desired pregnancy,"" he said. ""They want to have a baby, not an abortion."" But Tiller's practice made Wichita a flashpoint in the controversy over abortion, which opponents routinely decry as the killing of unborn children. Most anti-abortion leaders quickly condemned Tiller's killing and disavowed Roeder. The National Right to Life Committee, the largest anti-abortion organization in the United States, said it ""unequivocally condemns"" violence. And Wichita-based Operation Rescue said Roeder never was ""a member, contributor, or volunteer."" ""Operation Rescue has diligently and successfully worked for years through peaceful, legal means, and through the proper channels to see to it that abortionists around the nation are brought to justice. Without due process, there can be no justice,"" it said. But Hern called those disavowals ""hypocritical nonsense."" ""This is the result of 35 years of anti-abortion harassment and terrorism and hate speech and rhetoric and harsh names and exploitation of the abortion issue as a political issue to get power,"" said Hern, who runs an abortion clinic in Boulder, outside Denver. ""And this is the inevitable result of this kind of hateful behavior by the anti-abortion movement."" Carhart blasted abortion opponents who resort to violence ""and those who support and incite these violent acts."" He declined to name names but urged the estimated 46 million women who have received abortions and their supporters to demand that government officials ""enforce the laws on the books that protect us from hate crimes."" ""And if these officials don't openly respect your right to choose abortion, you have the power to vote them out of office,"" he said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama on Wednesday signed a measure awarding the 300 surviving Women Airforce Service Pilots from World War II the Congressional Gold Medal. Jane Tedeschi when she was in the Women Airforce Service Pilots program. The WASPs were formed in 1942. The bill passed by both chambers of Congress bestows one of the nation's highest civilian honors on the group known as WASPs more than 60 years after they were the first women to fly U.S. military aircraft. ""The Women Airforce Service Pilots courageously answered their country's call in a time of need while blazing a trail for the brave women who have given and continue to give so much in service to this nation since,"" Obama said in a statement. ""Every American should be grateful for their service, and I am honored to sign this bill to finally give them some of the hard-earned recognition they deserve."" The Women Airforce Service Pilots was formed in 1942 to create a corps of female pilots able to fill all types of flying jobs at home, freeing male military pilots to travel to the war front. The 1,100 members had to pay their own way to Texas for months of rigorous training. Once assigned to military bases, they did everything from participating in ground-to-air anti-aircraft practice; to towing targets for air-to-air gunnery practice with live ammunition; to flying drones; to conducting night exercises; to testing repaired aircraft before they were used in cadet training; to serving as instructors and transporting cargo and male pilots to embarkation points. Overall, they flew more than 60 million miles in every type of aircraft -- from the PT-17 and AT-6 trainers, to fast attack planes like the A-24 and A-25 and heavy bombers such as B-17 and B-29s. Paid $250 a month, the women were not officially part of the military -- receiving no benefits, no honors. Jane Tedeschi, who graduated in May 1944, was sent to a Selma, Alabama, base that did engineering work. ""We did whatever they asked us,"" she recalled in a CNN interview. ""You knew enough about flying you could adapt. ... Sometimes it was a little tougher."" While the work was technically noncombat, it could be dangerous. Thirty-eight of the women pilots were killed. As the war was winding down in December 1944, the program was closed with no recognition from the government and not much help for the women who served. They went off to restart their prewar lives, but without getting any of the help received by male veterans. Several of the women, however, have said they were not bitter since the only reason they had signed up was to do their part for the country. They noted they were just like the thousands of other women who also learned new skills and went to work in the factories to replace male workers sent off to war. ""We were proud of what we did, and the war was over. It was time to get on,"" Tedeschi said.  Watch Tedeschi recall WWII Â» . But many Americans were not aware of their efforts. The WASP records were sealed for more than 30 years.

"(CNN) -- A family friend of a U.S. soldier captured by the Taliban said his friends and family want Pfc. Bowe Bergdahl to ""stand tall, stand firm."" Pfc. Bowe Bergdahl in a video made by his captors, members of the Taliban. ""Bowe, if you see this, know that we love you and we are praying fervently for you and prayers are going up for you from all over the world,"" Tim Baker told CNN affiliate KTVB-TV in the soldier's hometown of Ketchum, Idaho. ""To all of our valiant men and women, know that the American people believe in you, support you and are 100 percent behind you, and we thank God every day that you have our back."" In a video released Sunday, apparently made by his captors, Bergdahl spoke of being ""scared I won't be able to go home."" ""It breaks our heart,"" Baker said. ""It's like having one of our own kids in this situation.""  Watch friend's comments about Taliban captive Â» . The Bergdahl family is not speaking with media, but Baker said prayer is helping. ""Prayer means that we are extremely powerful because God is not limited by where we are when we pray. He is there with Bowe, and so we know that he is protecting him and is with him, so we don't feel powerless against these people,"" Baker said. ""We feel very empowered."" Bergdahl, 23, was captured June 30 from Paktika province in southeastern Afghanistan, according to the Department of Defense. The Taliban has threatened to kill Bergdahl if foreign troops continue targeting civilians in the name of search operations in Ghazni and Paktika provinces, Taliban commander Mulvi Sangeen said by telephone Friday after being contacted by CNN at an undisclosed location. NATO-led forces in Afghanistan and the U.S. military have repeatedly denied targeting civilians. U.S. forces in Afghanistan are doing everything possible to free Bergdahl, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Monday. Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a news conference they were disgusted at the video that Bergdahl's captors released. ""My personal reaction was one of disgust at the exploitation of this young soldier,"" Gates said. In the 28-minute video, Bergdahl becomes emotional when he speaks of his family -- his parents, siblings, nieces and nephew -- and the girlfriend he hopes to marry. ""I have a very, very good family that I love back home in America, and I miss them every day that I'm gone,"" he says. ""I miss them, and I'm afraid I might never see them again and that I'll never be able to tell them I love them again. I'll never be able to hug them. ""I'm scared I won't be able to go home. It is very unnerving to be a prisoner,"" he said. However, his captors are treating him ""like a guest,"" he said. Asked by his captors if he had any message for Americans, the soldier said, ""To my fellow Americans who have loved ones over here, who know what it's like to miss them, you have the power to make our government bring them home. Please, please bring us home so we can be back where we belong and not over here."" It was not clear whether some or all of Bergdahl's remarks were scripted by his captors.  Watch excerpt from the video Â» . The last few minutes of the video show him eating a meal. The Bergdahl family expressed how they are feeling to Blaine County Sheriff Walt Femling. ""We've been overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and concern towards Bowe and our family. As you know, the situation is extremely difficult for everyone involved. We'd like to remind all of you our sole focus is seeing our beloved son Bowe safely home. ""Please continue to keep Bowe in your thoughts and prayers, and we ask for your continued acceptance of our need for privacy in this difficult situation. Thank you."" A reporter asked Femling if the military has restricted anything he has said and he answered that it has not. The Taliban earlier claimed responsibility for Bergdahl's kidnapping, the military said. Last week, the U.S. military distributed pamphlets in eastern Afghanistan in an effort to locate him. ""As you can see, the American soldier is in good shape and good health, and he is being treated well based on the guidelines of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan regarding war prisoners,"" said a statement on Islamist Web sites accompanying the video. ""Any decision regarding the American soldier will be the specialty of the high order of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, may God protect him."" The U.S. military said it believed Bergdahl may have been moved to various locations. In the video, Bergdahl's captor makes reference to his being moved from Paktika to Khandahar, saying the move was accomplished ""very easily."" The claim could not be independently verified. Asked the date by his captor, Bergdahl says it is July 14. Two versions of the pamphlets were distributed in Afghanistan, written in the Pashto language. They were made available to CNN by U.S. forces in Afghanistan. One shows the image of an American soldier shaking hands with a group of kids with the message, ""One of our American guests is missing. Return the guest to his home. Call us at"" -- and lists a phone number. The other shows a U.S. soldier kicking down a door, and then an outstretched hand with the superimposed image of a soldier, his head and arms drooping, and the words, ""If you do not release the U.S. soldier then ... you will be hunted."" The goal of the pamphlets was to balance the effort to get Bergdahl back with how U.S. forces interact with the local population, Gates and Mullen said Monday. Mullen said the message of the second pamphlet was ""not threatening, but to express that we will do what we have to do to find this individual."" Days after Bergdahl went missing, a senior U.S. military official said Bergdahl was captured by low-level militants and then quickly ""sold"" to the clan and network led by warlord Siraj Haqqani, who is believed to be deeply involved in the action. The Haqqani clan operates on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistani border and is well known to the U.S. military. Bergdahl apparently left his small outpost on his own on June 30 with no apparent means of defending himself, the official said. Taliban commander Mulvi Sangeen said he visited a military post in the Yousaf Khel district in the Paktika province, got drunk and was ambushed while returning to his car. Sangeen said the soldier was taken to a safe place. CNN could not independently verify Sangeen's claims. A source with the U.S. military denied the claim that Bergdahl was drunk. ""The Taliban are known for lying and what they are claiming [is] not true,"" the source said. In the video, Bergdahl says he was captured as he was lagging behind a patrol. Bergdahl is not a National Guardsman, according to the Idaho National Guard statement, but the organization said it was coordinating with the Department of Defense to provide public affairs duties and other assistance to the Bergdahl family. The family has requested privacy, the statement said. On Monday, four U.S. troops with the International Security Assistance Force were killed in eastern Afghanistan, according to a senior U.S. official there. The deaths would raise the total of U.S. military fatalities in Afghanistan to 30 in July, the highest monthly toll since the war began in October 2001. According to the security force, the four were killed in a roadside bombing.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Veteran actor Karl Malden, who won an Academy Award for his role in ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" has died at age 97, his manager said Wednesday. Karl Malden in ""The Streets of San Francisco"" in 1974. Malden was nominated for four Emmys for the series. Malden died in his sleep about 2:30 a.m. Wednesday, said his manager, Bud Ross. Malden appeared alongside Marlon Brando in two of director Elia Kazan's classic films of the 1950s -- ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and ""On the Waterfront."" He won the best supporting actor Oscar for ""Streetcar,"" which was released in 1951, in 1952 and was nominated for his role as a priest crusading against crooked union bosses in ""On the Waterfront."" Ross said he did not know the cause of death. ""It could be a combination of things,"" Ross said. ""He was 97 years old."" Born Mladen George Sekulovich in Gary, Indiana, the bulb-nosed actor made his New York stage debut in 1938 and first appeared in films in the 1940 melodrama ""They Knew What They Wanted."" After serving in the Army Air Corps in World War II, he made his mark in the New York production of ""Streetcar,"" by Tennessee Williams.  Watch Malden talk about why he got into acting Â» . Malden also did extensive work in television, starring with Michael Douglas in the police drama ""The Streets of San Francisco"" from 1972-77. He was nominated four times for Emmys for the show, and won a supporting-actor Emmy for his part in the miniseries adaptation of the true-crime bestseller ""Fatal Vision"" in 1985. His other well-known screen roles include his performances in ""Patton,"" in which he played World War II Gen. Omar Bradley alongside George C. Scott's title character; the steamy ""Baby Doll,"" another Elia Kazan-Tennessee Williams collaboration; and ""Gypsy."" Malden was also famous for a series of television ads for the American Express card, in which he advised viewers, ""Don't leave home without it."" Watch Malden talk why he took such diverse roles Â» . A memorial service is expected to be held within the next three to four weeks, Ross said. Malden was the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1989 to 1992. The Academy is best known for its annual awards, the Oscars. Malden's ""Streetcar"" Oscar had its own mini-drama. In 1985, he sent it to the manufacturer in Chicago for replating. But he discovered the award sent back to him was a fake in 2006, when the original appeared for sale on eBay. The Academy sued the sellers, Randy and Matt Mariani, who eventually returned the award. In 2004, he received the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award. Malden was born on March 22, 1912, and grew up in Gary. He broke his nose twice playing football in high school, where his athleticism won him a scholarship to Arkansas State Teacher's College in Conway. After being forbidden by his basketball coach to appear in a school play, Malden left college and began playing semi-pro basketball. He later worked in the steel mills of Gary to save money for drama school. When his acting career began, Malden took his grandfather's first name and rearranged the spelling of his own first name to make his professional last name. He said he changed his name, ""to fit theater marquees."" One of Malden's last acting roles was in 2000, according to IMDB.com.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Given a cast of Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill, and the guiding hand of director and writer Judd Apatow (""Knocked Up"" and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin""), perhaps there is no more appropriate title than simply ""Funny People."" Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow get together at the ""Funny People"" premiere in Hollywood. Which is saying something, since ""Funny People"" frequently treads into the darker realms of comedy. Sandler leads the cast as George Simmons, an A-list Hollywood comedian whose fame and fortune has brought him a beautiful mansion on the beach, lots of luck with the ladies and, as the audience soon discovers, a life of loneliness. Sandler is quick to point out that he and his character have little in common. ""I can't really say this guy is me; he's not living my life,"" says Sandler, who is married with two children. ""The movie star thing we have in common; we have a few mood swings in common. ... But the lifestyle and the attitude is not really me."" George's biggest problem isn't his desolation, however. He's been diagnosed with a leukemia-like terminal disease, prompting him to get back to his roots and do more stand-up comedy. Along the way, he hires struggling comedian Ira Wright, played by Rogen, to pen jokes for him and act as his personal assistant. Despite hurling an occasional insult at Ira, George learns to trust his new, eager-to-please sidekick. The feeling isn't always mutual. Ira is forced to adapt to his boss' constant mood swings, erratic behavior as he deals with the fear of dying and deep regret at losing Laura (Leslie Mann), the only woman he ever loved. However, Ira does earn a steady paycheck -- and gets a taste of show business. Rogen, who says he wouldn't be in comedy if he never saw Sandler's movies while he was growing up, says ""Funny People"" paints an accurate picture of the ups and downs of comedians who are just starting out. ""It's an incredibly realistic representation,"" Rogen says. ""Those scenes where you're backstage at the comedy club and you're all sitting around pitching jokes to each other. It's exactly like that."" Apatow, who performed stand-up comedy earlier in his career, says, ""It is an ode to stand-up. I've always been a crazy fan of stand-up comedians. Jonathan Winters ... Don Rickles, things like that."" Apatow, who knows he's taking a risk with ""Funny People's"" mix of light and darkness, made a wisecrack about his hopes for the film at the Los Angeles premiere. ""Well, I think there's 10 movies that are going to be up for best picture this year, and we definitely are shooting for No. 16,"" he says. The cast also took some risks, performing stand-up in front of live audiences for the film -- and, occasionally, watching their jokes fall flat. Hill says he had never done stand-up before and calls the experience ""terrifying."" ""It can be brutal out there,"" Rogen adds. Sandler, the most seasoned comedian by far, remembers his first days onstage and can relate. ""It's all about your last set,"" he recalls. ""If I did good Wednesday ... all day Thursday, I was in a good mood. ""Then Thursday night comes around and I go onstage and if I did bad, Friday was a miserable time for everyone.""","Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen star in Judd Apatow's ""Funny People""

"(CNN)  -- Houston, Texas, had a record high temperature Wednesday as a heat wave continues to grip the nation's midsection, the National Weather Service said Thursday. A woman tries to beat Houston's record heat by lying on a bench in the shade. The city sweltered with a high temperature of 104 degrees Wednesday, a record high for June 24, forecasters said. The previous record high for the date was 99 degrees, set in 1980. The previous record high measured for the month of June in Houston was 103 degrees, set on June 30, 1980, and June 18, 1934. Heat indices, a combination of temperature and humidity, are breaking the 110-degree mark in many cities. Forecasters predicted a high near 100 for Houston on Thursday, but the temperature could rise into the triple digits in outlying areas, said CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf. The weather service posted heat advisories for Houston; Dallas, Texas; and New Orleans, Louisiana, indicating that temperatures in those cities will feel like 100 to 105 degrees because of high humidity. In the Houston community of Bayland Park, the elderly were taking advantage of the air-conditioned Community Center. ""I don't like hot weather. I never have and never will,"" Teet Charloton told CNN affiliate KPRC-TV in Houston. ""But we have to have it. I go from the car to the house or come in here and go back the same way. I don't do much shopping, that's for sure."" Betty Dante added, ""It is very hot outside. ... I think as you get older, you feel the heat more."" In southwest Houston, Leticia Alvarado is profiting from the heat. The unemployed Houstonian has been running along the median on Hillcroft Street at Bellaire Boulevard for seven weeks. She is selling water for $1 a bottle. ""It's hot, too hot,"" she told the station. Other cities also were sweltering. New Iberia, Louisiana, had a temperature Wednesday of 102, which broke the record of 97 in 2005. An excessive heat warning was issued for St. Louis, Missouri, on Thursday through 7 p.m. CT Saturday. Forecasters predicted a high near 96. Cloud cover was expected to make temperatures there a little cooler Thursday, but the weather service warned, ""A hot and humid air mass remains over the area which will continue to control weather over the region through Saturday."" Afternoon and early evening heat index readings of 100 to 110 were expected in the Missouri city every day through Saturday. Young children, the elderly and people with chronic sicknesses were advised to stay inside if possible. The heat wave that began last week was being fed by a high pressure system north of Texas . Air quality alerts were posted for several cities, indicating pollutants exceed accepted standards.

"WASHAKIE COUNTY, Wyoming (CNN) -- In the predawn darkness the agents switch the federal plates on their vehicles to local Wyoming tags and check they have no other signs showing they are from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Edward Eugene Harper is believed to have lived a nomadic lifestyle since fleeing Mississippi. They want to give the impression that they are fish and wildlife officers, certainly not what they really are -- an elite squad in search of one of the FBI's 10 most-wanted fugitives. Their target lives eight miles up a dirt road in the Big Horn mountains of Washakie County -- and he is also not what he seems. For the past few years Edward Eugene Harper has been tending a flock of sheep in the semi-wilderness of the region. But 15 years ago he failed to turn up for a court appearance in Mississippi on charges he had molested two girls, aged 3 and 8. He'd been on the lam ever since. Recently the FBI had received a tip on his whereabouts.  Watch how FBI planned hunt for fugitive Â» . Snipers spent the night watching the truck with a camper top where Harper, 63, has been sleeping for the past few weeks. Michael Rankin, assistant special agent in charge at the FBI's Denver, Colorado, field office and leader of the operation to capture Harper, said he wanted to use a ruse to get close to Harper. ""We don't want to alert him or anybody who might be a supporter of his, and we want to get as close to him without somehow raising his antenna that we may be law enforcement and we may be wanting to take him into custody,"" Rankin said. ""It's an individual that has been a fugitive for almost 15 years, so he certainly doesn't want to go to jail or be put into the system after being on the lam for this length of time."" The locals are used to seeing officers from the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, and it's one of their men who will make the first contact and perhaps lead Harper to think the accompanying agents are also wildlife officials. The sun is up now and it is dusty and hot. At the end of the dirt road the FBI has officers working the command and control element, a team of crisis negotiators and investigators who will confirm Harper's identity, and a tactical unit aiming to make the arrest. FBI sources say they are concerned about another ""Ruby Ridge incident."" In August 1992, more than 400 members of federal and local law enforcement and the military converged on the Idaho hillside where a white separatist, Randy Weaver, lived in a cabin with his family. By the end of the operation, there had been a 12-day siege and a U.S. marshal, Weaver's wife and his 14-year-old son were dead. Ruby Ridge became a rallying cry for right-wing militias, and agents do not want this arrest mission spiraling out of control. Harper subscribes to ""sovereign citizen"" ideology and once claimed to be a member of the Montana Freemen, a group that rejected the authority of the U.S. government, the FBI said. In the end, the arrest of Harper is nothing like Ruby Ridge. He puts up no resistance, no shots are fired and there is no standoff. Harper, now with a heavy beard, shaggy hair and wearing a black patch on his left eye, sits calmly in a government SUV heading back into the system and a county jail in Casper, Wyoming, as authorities begin the process of extraditing him to Mississippi. He has requested a public defender. ""It feels very good that everybody's safe,"" Rankin said as the teams leave the wilderness to head back to base where they can strike a name off their most wanted list.","Accused child-molester Edward Eugene Harper detained in Wyoming .

"(CNN) -- Don't tell Brad Pitt who or how to love. Brad Pitt talks about ""soul mate"" Angelina Jolie, life, and fatherhood in Parade magazine. The actor and star of the new film ""Inglourious Basterds"" opened up to Parade magazine about his thoughts on love, marriage and fatherhood. During the candid interview, Pitt showed off a secret area in one of his homes which he said ""is a great place for sex"" and reflected on his early days in Hollywood, which included superstardom and some marijuana. ""I liked to smoke a bit of grass at the time, and I became very sheltered,"" Pitt told Parade. ""Then I got bored. I was turning into a damn doughnut, really.""

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- The husband of a woman who authorities say was impaired by marijuana and alcohol when she caused a head-on collision that killed eight people, including herself, has rejected claims of substance abuse by his wife. Daniel Schuler, left, and his attorney, Dominic Barbara, speak at Thursday's news conference. ""I've never seen her drunk since the day I met her,"" Daniel Schuler, referring to his wife, Diane, said Thursday. ""I'm not angry at her. I'd marry her again tomorrow."" Accompanied by his attorney, Schuler held a news conference to counter claims by authorities, who said Tuesday that Diane Schuler, 36, had a blood alcohol level of 0.19 percent -- more than twice the legal limit for drivers -- and had marijuana in her system when she drove a minivan the wrong way on the Taconic State Parkway and ran head-on into an SUV. Three adults in the SUV were killed in the July 26 collision, as were Schuler and four children -- her daughter and three nieces -- who were in the minivan. A fifth child in the minivan, Schuler's son, survived. On Thursday, Dominic Barbara, Daniel Schuler's lawyer, cited a list of medical aliments inflicting Diane Schuler before the crash. She apparently had a tooth abscess for two months, diabetes at ""various levels"" and a mysterious lump on her leg that seemed to move, he said.  Watch Daniel Schuler defend his wife Â» . ""I think she had a stroke,"" said Barbara, who admitted he had no evidence to support his claim. ""And I think from the stroke came all the other issues of what happened."" The crash happened about 30 miles north of New York after Schuler and the children left a campground where her family had stayed. Barbara said nobody at the camp saw Diane Schuler with alcohol. He said investigators interviewed nine people who spoke with Diane Schuler before she embarked, and those people did not smell marijuana or alcohol on her breath. ""Actually, it was the opposite,"" Barbara said. ""She was happy. She was talking to people."" Authorities said Tuesday that a broken vodka bottle was found in the minivan after the crash. Barbara said he couldn't explain the bottle, but he said, ""Something had to have happened."" Daniel Schuler and his lawyer said they have yet to decide on whether they want another autopsy. Jay Schuler, Daniel Schuler's sister, said Thursday that Diane Schuler was reliable and loved children. ""There's no way she'd do this,"" Jay Schuler said. ""She was responsible."" The statements by Schuler and his attorney differed from the toxicology report released Tuesday by the Westchester County District Attorney's Office. Besides the 0.19 percent blood alcohol level and marijuana, tests showed Diane Schuler had 6 grams of alcohol in her stomach that had yet to be metabolized, according to Maj. William Carey of the New York State Police. Meanwhile, an attorney representing families of two SUV occupants who died in the wreck said a lawsuit is likely. ""If I could prognosticate, it appears that there will be a civil suit,"" said Marshall Nemark, an attorney representing the families of Michael Bastardi and his son, Guy Bastardi, who were killed in the crash along with a friend.","Diane Schuler's husband says she didn't abuse alcohol, drugs .

"(CNN) -- Taliban militants, who implemented Islamic law in Pakistan's violence-plagued Swat Valley last week, have now taken control of a neighboring district. Protests in Karachi against the creation of sharia courts in Swat Valley. Here are some answers about the Swat Valley, its history and what's taking place there. What is Swat Valley? Swat Valley is located in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, near the border with Afghanistan and about 185 miles (300 kilometers) from the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. The alpine region once was one of Pakistan's premier tourist destinations, boasting the nation's only ski resort until it was shut down after Taliban militants overran the area. It also was a draw for trout-fishing enthusiasts and those wishing to visit the ancient Buddhist ruins in the area. What's happening in Swat Valley? In recent years Taliban militants unleashed a wave of violence that claimed hundreds of lives in the province. The militants wanted sharia law -- or Islamic law -- imposed in the region. They took over the valley in 2008. The central government of Pakistan, which long exerted little control in the area, launched an intense military offensive in late July to flush out the militants. In retaliation, the Taliban carried out a series of deadly attacks and began gaining ground, setting up checkpoints in the area. Has the government intervened? The militants and the Pakistani government reached a peace deal earlier this year, which was recently signed into law by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari. Under the deal, sharia law was imposed in the region. While the peace deal drew criticism for the Pakistani government, some analysts and political observers say the government had little choice but to capitulate, as militants have terrorized the region with beheadings, kidnappings and the destruction of schools. What's happening now? This week, the Taliban moved to seize control of the neighboring Buner district, bringing it closer to Islamabad than it has been since Taliban insurgency began. What is sharia law? Sharia law is Islamic law. While there are different interpretations of it, the Taliban's strict interpretation forbids women from being seen in public without their husbands and fathers, requires veils for women and beards for men, and bans music and television. Consequences are severe; during the Taliban struggle to impose sharia law, anyone found disobeying was pinned to the ground and lashed. Others were beheaded and hung from poles, with notices attached to their bodies that anyone daring to remove the corpse before 48 hours had passed would also be beheaded and hanged.","Taliban militants in Pakistan's Swat Valley take control of neighboring Buner district .

"(CNN) -- The father of a Florida girl who has been missing for nearly six months was charged Thursday with burglary with assault, police told CNN. Ronald Cummings was arrested on felony charges of burglary with assault, officials said. Ronald Cummings is being held on $12,500 bond for the felony charges, the Florida Putnam County Sheriff's Office said. There were no other details on his arrest available. Cummings' daughter, Haleigh Cummings, went missing from his home in Satsuma, Florida, on February 9. Cummings has made several public pleas for information about his daughter's disappearance, even begging whoever might be holding her to just return her home. Police have said they think Haleigh was abducted but have provided few details. In March, Cummings married his then-girlfriend Misty Croslin, who was the last person known to have seen the 5-year-old child alive, saying it was what Haleigh would have wanted. Croslin, 17, said she tucked Haleigh and her 4-year-old brother into bed about 8 p.m. the night Haleigh disappeared. Croslin said she went to sleep herself at about 10 p.m. but awoke at 3 a.m. to find Haleigh missing and a back door propped open by bricks. Ronald Cummings called police and reported his daughter missing when he returned from work at dawn.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. troops routinely face the threat of roadside bombs while fighting insurgencies in Afghanistan. They need the most protective clothing the market can bear, and they're getting it -- for now. North Carolina State University College of Textiles tests the flammability of different materials at this facility. Back home, a battle is brewing in Congress over the next lucrative contract for military uniforms. The issue boils down to the raw fiber used in their construction. Current uniforms are made in the United States, in Georgia, using a fabric called Defender M made by the TenCate company. It is favored by the military for its fire-resistant and breathable properties. But the fabric is made with a type of rayon imported from Austria, which normally would violate the military's buy-American requirement. This specific rayon cannot be produced in the United States for environmental reasons, so Congress passed an amendment allowing it to be temporarily imported. The extension expires, or ""sunsets,"" in 2013, but that year's defense budget is being determined now. The idea of the sunset is to give U.S. manufacturers time to come up with a comparable product. At stake: a defense contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars. American competitors have submitted alternatives, but after independent testing at North Carolina State University College of Textiles, the Defense Department concluded that TenCate's Defender M -- with its foreign-made fibers -- is the most flame-resistant. Dr. Roger Barker, who specializes in clothing flammability at the College of Textiles, conducted a demonstration for CNN. Based on his testing, the Army says Defender M resists fire the longest of other fabrics. ""What the new heat-resistant materials are able to do is add seconds of protection, so that seconds of protection can be the difference between a severe burn or a survival burn,"" Barker said. ""Life and death,"" echoes Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Georgia, regarding those extra seconds of fire protection. He asked the Senate to extend the waiver. ""So long as it's the best available in the world to protect our soldiers, we absolutely ought to maximize the use,"" Isakson told CNN. ""There is no American competitor that can meet or exceed it,"" Isakson said on the Senate floor. ""Obviously if there were, then that waiver would go away."" The U.S. Army's uniform procurer says soldiers prefer TenCate's product. ""They have consistently exceeded our expectations. This has proven to be a valuable fabric and well-received by our soldiers,"" Jeff Myhre told CNN. In a letter to CNN, a top military official said the ability to procure the foreign rayon ""a valuable authority."" ""Our periodic review of rayon requirements within the Military Services and testing of alternative items that are available domestically continue to support the determination that satisfactory quality and sufficient quantity of rayon yarn conforming to the domestic source requirements cannot be procured as needed,"" wrote Ashton Carter, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology & logistics. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, opposed Isakson's amendment, debating on the Senate floor that it ""permanently extends this waiver and will end all efforts to produce a domestic material to make military uniforms."" Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, agrees with Graham that U.S. companies won't have an incentive to invest in research and development. He says the exception was supposed to be temporary, and ""favors foreign suppliers of rayon over our own American companies."" He argued on the Senate floor that in due time, U.S. companies would be able to demonstrate an ability to manufacture materials that meet Army requirements. He's also worried about jobs. ""Some companies, like DuPont, for example, have already lost hundreds of jobs owing to their inability to compete for Army contracts,"" he said. The Senate voted, and the nays had it. No extension, no more imports of this fabric as of 2013. What next? The House of Representatives is expected to take up the bill when members return from the August recess. Isakson is confident his argument will prevail. ""Facts are stubborn things. I think when the facts get out they'll understand it's the right thing to do. Our armed forces want it and it's the best thing for our soldiers,"" he said. Pentagon Correspondent Chris Lawrence contributed to this report.","Uniforms made in Georgia by TenCate company, using a fabric called Defender M .

"(CNN) -- German Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich have confirmed Mark van Bommel as their captain for the new season, with Philipp Lahm named as vice-captain. Bayern Munich captain Van Bommel will be hoping to lift more trophies for the Bavarian giants this season. The Dutch midfielder was given the captain's armband by Jurgen Klinsmann last season after Oliver Kahn retired. However, the arrival of Anatoliy Tymoschuk from Zenit St Petersburg seemed to suggest that Van Bommel's place in the Bayern team was no longer guaranteed, but new coach Louis Van Gaal has decided that his compatriot will indeed be one of the first names on his team sheet next season. ""We have been observing his behavior on and off the field over the last four weeks and the influence he has on the club and on the squad,"" explained Van Gaal's assistant Andries Jonker on Bayern's official Web site. Tymoschuk must now fear for his place in the Bayern team after being told he is only second-choice behind Van Bommel. And, since Van Gaal has made it clear that he wanted to choose a captain who will play every week, Tymoschuk may have to spend much of his first season in Bavaria sitting on the substitutes' bench. ""He cannot play in his best position in our system,"" admitted Van Gaal. ""That is where Van Bommel plays. He could play on the right, but I have chosen Hamit Altintop for there. Every player is compared to his rivals and the coach makes the decisions."" Meanwhile, Bayern's French midfielder Franck Ribery has been declared fit to resume training after a summer spent battling tendonitis in his knee. Ribery missed the pre-season Audi Cup tournament involving Manchester United, AC Milan and Boca Juniors and is not likely to make Saturday's opening Bundesliga home match against Hoffenheim. But the France international, who was Monday called into his country's squad for the World Cup qualifier with the Faroe Isles in Torshavn on August 12, will be ready to train on Wednesday, .","Bayern Munich confirm Mark van Bommel as their captain for the new season .

"(CNN) -- Illinois will become the 17th state on Thursday to ban texting while driving, a safety worry that has caught the attention of the federal government. Texting poses a greater risk than talking or dialing while driving, a study says. Gov. Pat Quinn will sign an amendment to the Illinois Vehicle Code that prohibits writing, sending or receiving text messages while driving, said the governor's spokeswoman, Marlena Jentz. The bill does make texting exceptions for drivers who pull over to text or shift their car into park or neutral to message while stopped in traffic. Illinois will join a growing list of states looking to curb accidents linked to texting. Oregon and New Hampshire banned texting drivers in July, and Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington and the District of Columbia already have laws in place. Four U.S. senators announced their plan to push for a federal ban on July 29. U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said the Obama administration will convene a summit to discuss how it can end accidents caused by distracted drivers. Despite the ongoing efforts to address the dangers of texting while driving, studies have not shown whether the laws affect accident rates, said Jonathan Adkins, communications director at the Governor's Highway Safety Association. The nonprofit association comprised of appointees from each state's governor's office has closely followed the texting while driving saga. But Adkins said that because of several factors that potentially play a role in an accident, to know whether texting caused an accident would require a subpoena or an admission by the driver. In New York and New Jersey, the impact has been measured by an increase in driving tickets, but too few states track that data, Adkins said. ""With drunk driving it was important to pass tough laws, but the laws won't really have any effect unless they're enforced and the public knows about it and it's properly adjudicated,"" said Barbara Harsha the association executive director. ""So passing a law isn't the solution, it's only part of it."" Studies have shown that those who text while driving have an exponentially greater risk of an accident or near accident. A Virginia Tech Transportation Institute study found that truck drivers who texted while driving were 23 times more likely to crash or nearly get into wrecks than undistracted drivers. Compared with dialing, talking, listening or reaching for an electronic device, texting posed the greatest accident risk, the study found -- most likely due to the almost five seconds researchers found the drivers' eyes were off the roadway while texting, said Rich Hanowski, the director of the Center for Truck and Bus Safety at the transportation institute. The focus on texting while driving comes after a some high-profile accidents. In September, a California commuter train engineer missed a stop signal while trading text messages with a friend, leading to a collision with a freight train that killed 25 people, according to federal investigators. A mass-transit accident in Boston, Massachusetts, injured 62 people in May. The operator of a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority trolley was later charged with gross negligence after he admitted he had been texting seconds before the collision with another trolley, according to the Suffolk County district attorney and a National Transportation Safety Board official.","16 other states, District of Columbia ban texting while driving .

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- An undersea cable plugging east Africa into high speed Internet access went live Thursday, providing an alternative to expensive satellite connections. The cable links southern Africa to Europe and Asia. SEACOM, the cable provider company, opened its 17,000 kilometer submarine cable, capable of 1.28 terabytes per second, allowing the region true connectivity. Most Africans rely on expensive and slow satellite connections, which make the use of applications such as YouTube and Facebook extremely trying. ""This is going to reduce the cost of doing business in Africa, within Africa and with international parties"" said Suveer Ramdhani, SEACOM spokesman in South Africa. ""The cable is as thin as a hair strand, and in one second it can download the same amount of data that 160 people use in a month."" SEACOM, privately funded and 75 percent African owned, will provide retail carriers with open source access to inexpensive bandwidth. It has taken less than three years to complete the mammoth project, providing landing stations at South Africa, Kenya, Madagascar and other points along the east coast of Africa. But telecoms analyst James Hodge said that some of the more ambitious hopes for the system -- such as impacting the continent's socioeconomic problems -- will be long-term, and that initially it will be those already connected who will see the benefits. The launch was delayed by a month because of increased activity by pirates along parts of the African coast. Security teams were beefed up to protect the slow moving cable layers. Neotel, a South African communications network operator, is the largest SEACOM customer in South Africa and is the country's landing partner, providing both the coastal landing station and Johannesburg data center for the submarine cable. Neotel managing director Ajay Pandey is excited about the opportunities for growth presented by the SEACOM cable. ""With this cable coming in, the pipe size opens up, so more and more people are able to get faster and better connectivity, hopefully at a lower price. It can't be more expensive than what it is today."" SEACOM Chief Executive Officer Brian Herlihy added: ""Turning the switch 'on' creates a huge anticipation, but ultimately, SEACOM will be judged on the changes that take place on the continent over the coming years."" South Africa has been hobbled by high costs and extremely slow bandwidth, effectively keeping the country on an information back road rather then the superhighway. There is much anticipation and hope that the cable will ensure Africa keeps up with the developed world in Internet connectivity, providing greater speed, flexibility and, potentially, a complete socioeconomic transformation. Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete said in his opening address: ""It's the ultimate embodiment of modernity."" His speech was beamed via SEACOM from a launch in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to the simultaneous launch in Johannesburg, South Africa.","Undersea SEACOM cable links southern and east Africa to Europe, Asia .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Jeremy Piven is the kind of guy who can make you laugh just by lifting an eyebrow. Jeremy Piven stars as a used car salesman in ""The Goods."" He says ""Entourage"" would make a great film. Of course, the popular actor can do much more than that to captivate audiences. From drama to comedy, Piven has starred in more than 40 films on the big screen and has won critical acclaim for his role as super agent Ari Gold on HBO's ""Entourage."" (HBO, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.) Piven stopped by the CNN.com newsroom to talk with CNN's Nicole Lapin about his new film, ""The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard,"" in which he plays a used car salesman. The following is an edited version of the interview: . CNN: [The movie] was hysterical, and my producer and I were sitting next to each other and we were trying to figure out -- is this like lowbrow, but it's smart, so it's medium-brow? Highbrow comedy? Jeremy Piven: It's a hybrid-brow, or a unibrow. It's from the people who brought you ""Talladega Nights"" and ""Step Brothers"" and ""Anchorman,"" so from the kings of guys who make really smart, low-brow comedies, and I'm just insanely honored to be a part of it. It's like a dream because my fear was that by the time Will [Ferrell] hit the screen that, worst-case scenario, the movie wouldn't be funny enough. So that when Will jumps out of the plane, he takes us to a whole other level -- it's like, ""Oh my God, Will Ferrell is so brilliant."" But the reality is, the movie was so funny up until that moment that it was really, it was kind of organic, and it sustained it and it was really fantastic.  Watch why part of Piven's interview had to be bleeped out Â» . James Brolin would go home to his wife, Barbra Streisand, at night, and I would say, ""James, is she OK with all this?"" Because he has one of the most twisted roles you've ever seen, as you know -- and I don't want to give it away. He was like, ""Well, the wife is on the fence about this whole thing,"" and she came to a screening and I swear to God, Babs laughed the loudest. CNN: I think that's a tease in itself. That would probably get people to see it. Piven: Yes, I think you're right. The movie is OK'd by Barbra Streisand; she vetted the whole thing. If you would have told me, I would be doing a lead in a movie, and Will Ferrell would have a smaller role in it, I never would have believed you, but I'm here to tell you anything is possible. CNN: Anything is possible, even in some 40 some movies in your career, but this is the first lead in a while, I mean did it take you a while to get into the used car salesman character? Piven: There's a great documentary called ""Slasher"" about car salesmen that I took a look at, and I went to a bunch of lots, and I've also been sold a lot of cars, and I'm what's known as a sucker. As soon as they see me coming in, they know they're going to take my money. So I kind of took that, and I reversed it and I'm no longer a sucker. CNN: Are you going to stick with ""Entourage""? Piven: Well, I think ""Entourage"" ... this season is the sixth season, and it's I think the most interesting of all of them, and I kind of have the best arc this year. The backstage life of Hollywood is such fertile stuff for our show that I think we could continue on for as long as it stays fresh. CNN: What about a movie? Piven: I think a movie would be really, really fun of ""Entourage."" I'd love to open it up.

"(CNN)  -- Former U.S. President Bill Clinton landed in North Korea early Tuesday on a mission to negotiate the release of two American journalists imprisoned there since March, according to the country's state news agency and a CNN source. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton is shown at an environmental summit in Seoul, South Korea, in May. The North Korean news agency KCNA did not disclose the purpose of the visit in its three-line dispatch. But a source with detailed knowledge of the former president's movements told CNN late Monday that Clinton was going to seek the release of Laura Ling and Euna Lee, both reporters for California-based Current TV -- media venture launched by Clinton's former vice president, Al Gore. Meeting Clinton were the vice president of North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly, Yang Hyong Sop, and Kim Kye Gwan, the vice foreign minister, KCNA reported, adding that ""a little girl presented a bouquet to Bill Clinton."" The women were arrested while reporting on the border between North Korea and China and sentenced in June to 12 years in prison on charges of entering the country illegally to conduct a smear campaign. Since the United States has no diplomatic relations with North Korea, efforts to resolve the issue so far have been handled through Sweden, which represents U.S. interests in the reclusive communist state.  Watch what may lie behind the pick of Bill Clinton Â» . Last month, Clinton's wife -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- said the Obama administration had dropped its request for Ling and Lee to be released on humanitarian grounds and instead was seeking amnesty, which implies forgiveness for an offense. This change in language is an important distinction that could move North Korea to release the women without feeling that its legal system has been slighted, according to analyst Mike Chinoy. ""I suspect that it was made pretty clear in advance that Bill Clinton would be able to return with these two women otherwise it would be a terrible loss of face for him,"" said Chinoy, an Edgerton Senior Fellow on Asia at the Pacific Council on International Policy in Los Angeles. ""The bigger, broader and more important question is what else could be on the agenda. Will Clinton be carrying a letter from Barack Obama for the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il? Will he meet Kim Jong Il?"" Clinton's mission comes as the United States and its allies in the region are trying to push North Korea back into stalled nuclear disarmament talks. North Korea conducted a nuclear bomb test, its second, in May, and has conducted several missile tests since then. The United Nations responded by tightening and expanding sanctions on the North. The two nations were on opposite sides in the 1950-1953 Korean War and had no regular contacts before a 1994 crisis over North Korea's nuclear program. North Korea agreed at that time to halt the development of nuclear weapons, but abandoned that accord and withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003. Clinton had considered visiting North Korea in 2000 near the end of his second term as president. His secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, had gone to Pyongyang in early 2000 to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il -- now widely reported to be ill. CNN's Charlie Moore contributed to this report.","NEW: Signs point to Clinton being able to win amnesty for reporters, Chinoy says .

"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lanka's government said Monday its forces had killed Tamil rebel chief Velupillai Prabhakaran as he attempted to flee, according to the country's state-run news agency. The Sri Lankan government says Tamil chief Velupillai Prabhakaran is dead. The Tamil rebel group, formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), is aware of the government's report but has yet to confirm Prabhakaran's death or the deaths of its other leaders, according to a posting on the pro-rebel Web site, Tamilnet.com. It said ""initial reports indicate a determined massacre by the Sri Lanka Army."" Prabhakaran was one of 19 senior LTTE leaders that the government has identified among the bodies found as its troops completed mop-up operations after routing the Tigers, the defense ministry said. The leaders include Prabhakaran's eldest son, Charles Anthony, as well as Pottu Amman, LTTE's intelligence leader, according to the ministry. Prabhakaran founded the rebel group, which has been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries. It pioneered the use of women in suicide attacks and, according to the FBI, invented the explosive suicide belt. It was also behind the assassination of two world leaders -- the only terrorist organization to do so.  Watch more on the possible end of fighting Â» . Prabhakaran is accused of masterminding the killing of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 in the Tamil-dominated Indian state of Tami Nadu as he campaigned for a second term. Sri Lankan authorities allege that Prabhakaran was avenging Gandhi's decision to send Indian peacekeepers to Sri Lanka. Two years later a Tigers suicide bomber, allegedly acting under Prabhakaran's orders, detonated explosives that killed Sri Lanka's then-president, Ranasinghe Premadasa, during a rally. Over the weekend, the militants offered to ""silence"" their guns after an intense military offensive decimated their ranks, pushed them from their stronghold in the north and east of the country, and cornered the remaining rebels on a small stretch of land. If the rebels honor their pledge, it would potentially mark the end of the longest-running civil war in Asia. Prabhakaran's supporters considered him a hero with a single-minded focus -- to fight for the rights of his people. The Sri Lankan government deemed him a war criminal with a disregard for civilian casualties. He was wanted by Interpol on charges including terrorism and organized crime. In the past it has been reported he wore a cyanide capsule around his neck -- to swallow and kill himself rather than risk capture. And he reportedly expected the same dedication from his troops. As a result, few Tigers have been captured alive. Sri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapaksa is expected to announce that ""military operations"" against the Tiger rebels have ended in an address to parliament and country on Tuesday.  Watch aid agencies fear for Sri Lanka Â» . The rebels have fought for an independent state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka since July 1983.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- With hundreds of protesters gathering and riot police out in force on the streets of Tehran, hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took the oath of office Wednesday, beginning a second term in a bitterly divided Iran. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was sworn in Wednesday as Iran's president. He begins his second term. Ahmadinejad, 52, was formally sworn in before Iran's parliament, known as the Majlis, as security forces guarded the building and nearby streets in anticipation of protests. Witnesses reported a heavy police presence -- including members of the pro-government Basij militia -- and several choppers hovering overhead. Some reported protesters, many of them women, sitting in front of the parliament building's entrance. As discontent surfaced yet again, Ahmadinejad vowed to take Iran forward and flung sharp words at those who questioned the validity of the June 12 elections, in which he was declared the winner with almost two-thirds of the vote. He took particular aim at the United States, Britain, France, Italy and Germany, which have not sent formal letters of congratulations to Ahmadinejad. ""They said they would recognize the election, but will not congratulate,"" Ahmadinejad said in his inaugural speech. ""This means they only want democracy at the service of their interests and don't respect the people's vote and rights. ""Nobody in Iran is waiting for anyone's congratulations,"" he said.  What's next for Iran? Â» . Asked Tuesday whether the White House recognizes Ahmadinejad as the rightful leader of Iran, press secretary Robert Gibbs said, ""He's the elected leader."" Gibbs expanded on that comment Wednesday, telling reporters ""It's not for me or for us to denote his legitimacy, except to acknowledge the fact."" ""Whether any election was fair, obviously the Iranian people still have questions about that, and we'll let them decide that,"" Gibbs said. ""But I would simply say he's been inaugurated, and we know that is simply a fact."" The United States and Iran have had no diplomatic relations since 1980. Britain has maintained ties, but has criticized the Iranian crackdown on protests that followed the disputed election and has not issued a statement of congratulation to Ahmadinejad. However, the British ambassador to Tehran did attend the ceremony, and the Foreign Office in London said the international community still needs to engage Iran on ""serious issues,"" such as its nuclear program. ""While we need to engage with Iran's government, today's ceremony does not change our position on Iran's elections,"" the Foreign Office said. Among others attending Wednesday's ceremony were Iran's top lawmakers, the heads of the three branches of government, the secretary of the Guardian Council and foreign diplomats. But as the camera of the semi-official Press TV panned the hall, an unprecedented number of empty seats were visible. It was unclear whether opposition leaders were boycotting the inauguration. Ahmadinejad struck a note of unity in his attempt to move Iran forward, saying ""Who has voted for whom -- this is not the question. Today we need a national resolve. Today we need to join forces."" He vowed to promote religion and morality, and support righteousness and spread justice. ""I will guard the power that the people have entrusted in me as the sacred trust,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""I will safeguard it like an honest and faithful trustee."" Ahmadinejad, however, starts another four years in office with many Iranians questioning his legitimacy. The results of the June 12 election were widely disputed; Ahmadinejad's chief rival, reformist Mir Hossein Moussavi called the elections a ""fraud."" Since the vote, Iran has seen turmoil not witnessed since the 1979 Islamic revolution as thousands have taken to the streets to protest and security forces have brutally cracked down. Analyst Amir Taheri told CNN Wednesday that Ahmadinejad's second term will be closely watched around the world. Taheri said the freshly inaugurated president faces myriad challenges in his second term, among them a faltering economy and a burgeoning popular movement favoring reform. ""He has to worry a lot about the opposition,"" Taheri said. Iran says about 30 people have been killed in the post-election violence. Among those who were arrested, 110 are facing trial, according to Iranian media reports. Under Iran's constitution, the incoming president must receive the supreme leader's approval before being sworn into office. On Monday, after Ayatollah Ali Khameini gave that endorsement to Ahmadinejad, hundreds of Iranians again demonstrated in the Iranian capital. Witnesses and sources said the crowds marched on the sidewalks around Vannak Square and Vali Asr Avenue, under the watchful eye of hundreds of Iranian security forces. Some chanted ""Death to the dictator,"" while others said ""God is great."" International media outlets, including CNN, have been restricted in their coverage of Iran in the aftermath of the elections.","Mahmoud Ahmadinejad begins a second term as Iran's president .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Lets face it: All the information around cholesterol makes it something of a confusing topic. Not only do we make our own cholesterol, but we also must have it to produce other important body assets, such as cell membranes and certain types of hormones. ""Good"" cholesterol vs. ""bad"" cholesterol and all the associated numbers can be confusing. So it's a bodily must-have. But we also augment that inner cholesterol machine by eating foods high in saturated fats such as whole dairy products and red meats and probably half the offerings at any fast-food spot. Add to that the fact many people simply overproduce or underproduce cholesterol because of their genes -- and that is just the beginning of the conundrum over cholesterol. But while many can't quite wrap their brain around it, the reality is many of us are affected by it, and not in a good way. According to the American Heart Association, almost half the adult female population in the United States suffers from high cholesterol. Add in the good vs. bad cholesterol and all the different numbers for the different levels and it starts making my head spin. Fortunately I was able to speak with two very smart cardiologists for guidance. Dr. Nieca Goldberg, a cardiologist in New York, set me straight. She explains it's all about the balance. ""Cholesterol is an important substance and has many benefits for our bodies, but only a set amount keeps your body in a nice situation."" Our bodies make the good and the bad kind of cholesterol, and according to Goldberg, who is also a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association's ""Go Red for Women"" campaign, they are pretty efficient machines. ""The system is set up so that the HDL high density lipoproteins, or artery-cleaning or 'good' cholesterol, cleans out the LDL low density lipoproteins, or 'bad' cholesterol,"" she explains. So, basically the good ushers out the bad by dragging it to the liver, and the liver gets rid of it. But when the bad outweighs the good, that's when the trouble begins. Dr. Nanette Wenger, chief cardiologist at Atlanta's Grady hospital, paints a cheery picture for us. ""Cholesterol is this fatty gruelly substance that builds up in the arteries, and when those obstructions have high levels of fat they are much more likely to burst."" OK, got it: Buildup bad, burst worse! According to the American Heart Association, the bad cholesterol, with a little help from some other substances in your body, join together and form a united front (that is, a hard deposit inside your arteries) that could block the flow of blood to the heart, causing a heart attack. Or it could block the flow to the brain, causing a stroke. So, it seems that bully bad cholesterol really needs to be shut down.  Health for Her: Watch to learn more about cholesterol in women Â» . But how do you do that? First you have to be informed. Wenger says, ""I've always said that women should know three numbers and there are so many numbers tossed around I think all of us can get confused. But I want my women patients to remember three numbers: 50, 100 and 150. Fifty is the good cholesterol, the HDL -- that should be above 50. One hundred is the LDL, the bad cholesterol. And 150 is the triglycerides, another blood fat, and your triglycerides should be below 150. So be sure that your physician tells you your numbers. If they are fine, do what you do to keep them fine, and if they are abnormal, work with your doctor to change them."" The first two steps, says Goldberg, are about changing your lifestyle. ""You have to adopt a healthy diet and you have to exercise,"" she says. ""People with mild cholesterol problems can usually bring their numbers down just by doing those two things. Exercise is one of the most effective measures for raising good cholesterol."" A low-fat diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids -- found in foods Including salmon, walnuts and flax seeds -- is also a good bet for boosting the good stuff. However, sometimes that is not enough. Wenger says, ""Some people have genetic predispositions and have very abnormal cholesterol. Some just make more cholesterol than others, so if your cholesterol is high, it is not that you are a failure. It's that your lifestyle interventions have not been adequate to get cholesterol to the levels we want."" Sometimes, if warranted, those lifestyle changes need to be helped with medicine. But, cautions Goldberg, ""I've said to my patients, medications alone can't do everything. They need to help themselves by modifying their lifestyles with a low-fat diet and exercise, less stress, more sleep,"" all things that we know will keep us healthier longer. So, while in the beginning the cholesterol issue was a conundrum, in the end it's really a simple story about equipping the good to fight the bad (on a molecular level) and making the right choices so my blood won't get held back on its travels through my veins. OK, that I get! E-mail to a friend .","Heart association: Almost half U.S. adult females suffer from high cholesterol .

"(CNN)  -- A human rights group urged Burundi to reverse a law that makes homosexuality illegal, saying it risks worsening the harsh treatment of gays in the eastern Africa nation. In March, people in Burundi demonstrate in favor of a measure banning homosexuality. It became law in April. The new law makes ""sexual relations with persons of the same sex"" illegal and punishable by up to two years in prison, Human Rights Watch said in a recently released report. It was enacted just as the gay, lesbian and transgender community had started to mobilize and call for equal treatment, according to the organization. ""The government needs to listen to these voices to understand the harm it is doing to Burundians with its state-sanctioned discrimination,"" said Georgette Gagnon, Africa director for Human Rights Watch. ""The government should rescind this law and instead work to promote equality and understanding."" Before the law, which was passed in April, some gays and lesbians already faced significant discrimination in Burundi, according to the organization. Some had lost their jobs, others were beaten by parents and local youths, and others were evicted, according to the Human Rights Watch report, which cited accounts by the victims. Numerous attempts to reach government officials were unsuccessful. Homosexuality is illegal in most countries in the region, including in nearby Kenya and Uganda, where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. Most African nations have revised those laws to include consensual sex among gay and lesbian couples and made the punishments tougher, according to Human Rights Watch. ""Half the world's countries that criminalize homosexual conduct do so because they cling to Victorian morality and colonial laws,"" said Scott Long, director of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights program for Human Rights Watch. ""Getting rid of these unjust remnants of the British empire is long overdue."" The role religion plays in Africa has a lot to do with the ban, others say. ""It is wrong from a biblical standpoint, and most African countries are governed based on religious beliefs,"" said Olatunde Ogunyemi, a professor in Grambling, Louisiana. ""Christianity and Islam are the dominant religions in the continent, and in some cases, constitutions are based on religion, which justifies making it illegal."" South Africa's post-apartheid constitution bans discrimination against gays -- the first in Africa to prohibit discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Homosexuality is also illegal in other countries, including Ghana, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, according to Human Rights Watch.","Human Rights Watch fears new law risks worsening harsh treatment of gays .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- At least 441 people have died in floods in India from this season's monsoon rains, federal authorities said in their latest report. An Indian child plays in a flooded street in Mumbai earlier this month. Flooding has affected more than 1.5 million people in parts of India, said the disaster management division of the federal home ministry. The country's main weather office has warned of more heavy rain in western and central parts of India. Monsoon rains sweep across the subcontinent from June till September. Though they bring much-needed relief to often-parched farmlands, they also leave a trail of landslides, home collapses and floods that can kill. In neighboring Pakistan, torrential monsoon rains left more than three dozen people dead and broke a 32-year record over the weekend.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Federal, state and municipal agencies staged an elaborate drill in the waters off New York City on Tuesday to prepare for the possibility of a nuclear or dirty-bomb attack from the water. A U.S. Coast Guard vessel passes a container ship in New York Harbor as part of Tuesday's terror drill. ""We're a big city, and there are vulnerabilities,"" said Ray Kelly, commissioner of the New York Police Department. Agencies involved in Tuesday's test  emphasized they did not undertake it because of a specific threat against the city. However, Kelly said the city was taking no chances after a proclamation years ago by Osama bin Laden. ""We do know that Osama bin Laden several years ago obtained a fatwah to use nuclear weapons, and our goal is to make certain that that fatwah does not come to fruition,"" he said. In addition to increasing various agencies' preparedness for a seaborne radiological attack, Kelly said Tuesday's well-publicized drill was meant to deter those who would perpetrate such an attack. ""It pays to advertise to a certain extent. We want anyone who would do us harm to know that we're out there, that we have the capability to detect,"" Kelly said. Eight government agencies participated in the drill, ranging from the NYPD to the U.S. Coast Guard. The exercise took place at the entrance of New York Harbor, just south of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge linking Staten Island to Brooklyn. Per the drill's plan, eight boats were to cross a checkpoint set up by authorities. They were on the lookout for abnormally high concentrations of radioactivity -- a telltale sign of an improvised nuclear device or a radiological dispersal device, more familiarly known as a dirty bomb. Some of the boats were decoys with no radioactive substances aboard, while others had actual radioactive isotopes planted in them. A radioactivity detector in the hull of the authorities' boats was to identify which vessels had radioactive substances in them. The devices are highly sensitive -- so much so that people who have recently had certain medical treatments can set them off. It was up to the authorities participating in the drill to sort the good boats from the bad -- and to intercept the bad. Only minutes into the six-hour exercise, equipment aboard a police boat detected radioactivity within a small white pleasure craft passing through the checkpoint. Two patrol vessels then converged on the pleasure craft, while officials began to question the driver and his two passengers. Soon after, authorities boarded the boat and used a radiation detector, officially known as a radiological isotope identification detector, to produce a ""spectrum"" of the radiological material. They then transmitted the spectrum to the Department of Homeland Security's Joint Analysis Center (JAC) in Washington to determine precisely what radiological material was aboard the boat. Within moments, the JAC radioed back with a positive identification: Caesium-137, an industrial radioactive isotope that if used in large enough quantities could power a devastating dirty bomb. Sure enough, when a separate boat containing press and police officers sidled up to the apprehended craft soon afterward, the portable radioactivity detectors of officers onboard began to sound excitedly. NYPD Sgt. Art Mogil said that, in part, the agencies chose to practice on leisure craft to illustrate that radiological weapons could be transported in deceptively benign-looking boats. ""It doesn't require a large vessel. A device can be just a few pounds and still be a major threat,"" Mogil said. James Waters, counterterrorism chief for the NYPD, said exercises like Tuesday's were vital because the stakes involved are so high. ""Someone bringing in a radiological or nuclear device would be very serious if not catastrophic,"" he said. On an average day, not all incoming maritime traffic in New York City is subjected to the radioactivity tests performed at Tuesday's drill. An NYPD official declined to specify what percentage of boats normally undergo such screening.","NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly: ""We're a big city, and there are vulnerabilities""

"(CNN) -- The music isn't new, but the discovery that a young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ""almost certainly"" composed it is a stunning revelation. A researcher in Austria says the works were probably transcribed by Mozart's father, as young Mozart played. The two compositions -- a concerto in G and a prelude in G -- have long been in the files at the International Mozarteum Foundation in Salzburg, Austria, as anonymous works and were even published in the book ""New Mozart Edition"" in 1982. Now Ulrich Leisinger, director of the foundation's research department, believes the works actually were composed by Mozart before he was old enough to write music, and that Mozart's father, Leopold, transcribed them. The foundation said in a statement that Leisinger analyzed the handwriting and other ""stylistic criteria"" to determine the music was ""almost certainly unknown compositions by"" the young Mozart. The compositions were found in a book, compiled by Mozart's father, that was used for practice and the musical education of both Mozart and his sister, according to the statement. Leisinger's analyses ""support the claim that they were actually composed by the young Mozart, who was not yet versed in musical notation, and transcribed by his father as the boy played the works at the keyboard,"" the statement said. Jeffrey Kimpton, president of the Interlochen Center for the Arts in Michigan, called the works ""a remarkable historical find."" He said Leopold Mozart transcribed his son's early works as a way of preserving them. ""When parents go to a piano recital of an early student, a young student, who's playing for the first time, they get a video tape, they get a DVD, that's a way of recording it,"" Kimpton said. ""I think what's exciting is that Mozart's father wanted to preserve this incredible genius. The young boy at this time didn't know how to write music, but he sure could play it. It's like a family photo or video album."" Finding such historical treasures is like detective work, Kimpton said. ""You're kind of putting together a DNA picture,"" he said. ""This particular museum has hundreds of manuscripts. Over time as you learn more and more by various scholars working on this, you might turn the page and you may have looked at it a hundred times before but suddenly begin to see some things or understand some things that make some sense."" Mozart was born in Salzburg in 1756 and started composing when he was 5 years old. By the time of his death in 1791, he had written more than 600 pieces of music.","Researcher: Two pieces likely composed by Mozart before he could write music .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- For years, doctors and patients have been using DNA analysis to diagnose anything from paternity to predisposition to inherited disease. Now, Chinese scientists say genetic testing can identify inherent ""talents"" as well. The results can reveal athletic or musical talents but cannot necessarily identify the next Yao Ming. By examining the DNA from a simple cheek swab, scientists at Shanghai Biochip Co., one of China's largest biotechnology companies, say they can uncover a person's natural strengths and weaknesses with 99 percent accuracy. They test eleven genes that they say correspond to memory, swiftness, thinking, comprehension, emotion, adventure, braveness, focus ability, perseverance, vigor and physical strength. According to the company, specific combinations of the genes can reveal whether someone is genetically predisposed to being highly intelligent, athletic, musical and more. In the case of memory, the scientists examine the gene known as BDNF, the Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor gene. Research by America's National Institute of Health suggests that different variants of the BDNF gene correspond to different competences in episodic memory (the ability to recall recent events) as well as different activity-levels in the hippocampus (the area of the brain that mediates memory).  See photos of the children's summer camp in China where such testing occurs Â» . Each person has one of three possible BDNF variants: AA, AG and GG. Each variant or base pair refers to the two gene components that make up each gene on the DNA's double helix. Most people have the GG variant, which indicates ""normal"" memory. Fewer people have the AG base pair, which corresponds to ""above average"" memory. AA is the rarest and strongest type of memory gene variant. ""The AA genotype is the best in memory. (Someone with an AA pairing) will learn something easy and remember the result longer than others can,"" said Yang Yanqing, the lab's technical director. Once lab technicians determine the base pairs for each of the eleven talent genes, specialists draw conclusions about a person's broader characteristics and even make career recommendations based a person's talent level in each of the eleven categories. ""This child is very thoughtful and focused,"" Shanghai Biochip's Healthcare Director Huang Xinhua explained while looking over a girl's test results. ""I suggest she go into management."" Although the results can also reveal athletic or musical talents, genetic testing will not necessarily be able to identify the next Yao Ming or Yo-Yo Ma. DNA analysis only provides an indication of someone's talent potential, not their realized skill-level, the scientists say. ""It's not like genes decide everything. Genes just decide 30 to 60 percent. The rest is post-natal. A child's upbringing, nutrition, and education are all very much related,"" said Huang. Still for many Chinese parents, it is worth knowing that extra 30 to 60 percent more about their child. The lab, which conducts many other types of DNA tests, has seen a surge in the demand for genetic talent tests, most of the requests come from parents on behalf of their children. In a country where, by law, most couples can only have one child, parents seem to be turning to biotechnology to ensure their only child reaches his or her full potential.","Scientists at Shanghai Biochip Co. say they can uncover a person's natural strengths .

"Editor's note: Julian E. Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. His new book, ""Arsenal of Democracy: The Politics of National Security -- From World War II to the War on Terrorism,"" will be published this fall by Basic Books. Zelizer writes widely about current events. Julian Zelizer says Medicare is a case of government playing a positive role in health care. PRINCETON, New Jersey (CNN) -- Health care reform has gotten off track. The president's news conference fell flat. Polls show growing unease with the proposals currently in play. And Congress will not meet the deadline that President Obama imposed. The status quo, as the president correctly explained to reporters, is not sustainable. Our health care system is not working. Millions of people lack insurance, costs are out of control, businesses and workers are struggling to keep up with premiums, and there are tremendous inefficiencies plaguing many parts of the system. Conditions will only become worse in coming years. Our health care system brings to mind the economist Herbert Stein's famous maxim: ""When something can't go on forever, it will stop."" When Congress returns in September, Obama will only be able to revitalize the prospects for health care reform if he offers Americans a stronger argument about what government can do to improve this situation. After years of being in the opposition, Democrats are still scared about defending the value of government. Their political nerves have been exacerbated by polls showing the public is growing increasingly concerned about the size of government spending. This reticence about government, in the aftermath of the Democrats' dramatic 2008 election victory, has been one of the most striking aspects of the administration's rhetoric in the past few months. Before the 1970s, Democrats were full of confidence when pushing for federal programs. Indeed, 44 years ago this week, on July 30, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed the legislation that created Medicare and Medicaid. The event took place at Harry Truman's presidential library in Independence, Missouri. Sitting beside the 81-year-old former president, Johnson announced: ""No longer will older Americans be denied the healing miracle of modern medicine. No longer will illness crush and destroy the savings that they have so carefully put away over a lifetime so that they might enjoy dignity in their later years."" The program succeeded. Government worked. Before Medicare started, only about 50 percent of Americans who were 65 or older possessed hospital coverage. Within five years of the program's creation, 97 percent of the elderly had hospital coverage. The same changes occurred with physician's coverage. Today, more than 40 million elderly Americans rely on the program -- as do their families who don't have to take responsibility for these costs. Besides expanding coverage, Medicare has become instrumental to the health care industry. For all the complaints that we hear about Medicare, the reality is that most hospitals and doctors have come to depend on these federal payments into their system. Those who want to keep government ""out"" of the industry rarely acknowledge that government is already ""in."" While doctors were at the forefront of the campaign against Medicare, they turned out to be among the program's biggest beneficiaries. As political scientist Jonathan Oberlander told Slate about the industry, ""If they'd known how well they were going to do, they wouldn't have spent all those years opposing it. They would have said, 'Please pass this.' "" Medicare has also been able to accomplish the impossible: compel hospitals to change the way in which they charge for care. While policymakers had originally allowed hospitals to charge ""reasonable costs"" to the program, reforms in 1983 created the Prospective Payment System. Rather than paying hospitals for each patient they took care of, Medicare paid hospitals a fixed amount of money. The change resulted in significant cost reductions. Most recently, in Massachusetts, state policymakers have observed that the existence of a strong government program has created an opportunity to achieve such cost measures at the state level. And finally, Medicare has proven to be more popular than private insurance programs. So, for all the talk about hating big government, the big government seems to be doing something right, according to numerous polls. According to a Kaiser poll, 68 percent of respondents said they believed the Medicare program would put ""your interests above their own"" compared to 48 percent for private insurance. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that more than 70 percent of Medicare fee-for-service recipients were satisfied with their access to care, in contrast to those on private insurance, where only 51 percent felt they could always obtain what they needed. Certainly, Medicare has been far from perfect. The program has not been good at innovation. When Congress added catastrophic medical coverage to Medicare in 1988, legislators were forced to retreat and repeal the plan in 1989 after encountering a political backlash. Congress added prescription drug benefits to Medicare, but not until 2003. Medicare has also become an enormously expensive part of the federal budget, requiring significant increases in payroll taxes while squeezing discretionary spending for other policies. All in all, however, Medicare has done pretty well for this country. It remains the best argument President Obama can make in response to his critics. Of course, arguments were not all that LBJ relied on. Johnson was willing to make key compromises on the legislation, such as originally allowing hospitals to determine charges and sitting back as Ways and Means Chairman Wilbur Mills -- who had opposed the proposal for several years -- redrafted the measure in the final weeks and then publicly claimed credit for the outcome. Johnson was also willing to strong-arm members of his own party who were on the fence about the bill. But in the end, the key to Medicare was not politicking but a compelling belief that government could play a positive role in this country and in our health care system. As policymakers enter into the final rounds of this debate, they would do well to look carefully at the program that Lyndon Johnson signed into law in July 1965 and see just what Washington, despite all the knocks it takes, can provide. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Zelizer: Democrats nervous about expanding government role in health care .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Hundreds of excited music fans wait in line, on the lookout for their favorite singers on a hit television show. Elaha Sorur was the lone female finalist on this season's ""Afghan Star."" Just a few years ago, television and some music was banned in Afghanistan. Instead of spending the time outside a New York venue or Hollywood soundstage, though, these fans braved barbed wire and gun-toting guards in Kabul to attend Afghanistan's premier pop music event: the finals of ""Afghan Star,"" the embattled country's answer to ""American Idol."" In line, bright mod outfits have replaced Kabul's normally conservative dress code. Onstage, men sport the latest styles. And on TV screens, a country's new battle between traditional and pop culture plays out. ""For the young generation,"" says one fan in line, ""it's very important to be cool, with a cool mind."" Inside the concert hall, Jahid Mohseni, a 38-year-old Afghan-Australian media mogul, tries to manage the chaos he's created. Singers, child acrobats and TV technicians all compete to get his attention before the start of Afghanistan's biggest night of television. Mohseni, who started the country's top television network, Tolo TV, says he's just trying to revive Afghan culture after the fallow Taliban era, when music and television were banned.  Watch performances on ""Afghan Star"" Â» . ""Yes, we are promoting social change, but we cannot push Afghan society where it doesn't want to go. This is a commercial enterprise, and it's reflecting what people want,"" Mohseni said. In Afghanistan, more than 60 percent of the population is younger than 25, and judging by the popularity of ""Afghan Star,"" ""they're like people everywhere. They're not from Mars,"" Mohseni said. At the fourth-season finals this year, the audience included those who sat quietly as well as those who loudly cheered for contestants including Naweed Forugh (who would be named the ""Afghan Star"" winner), Naweed Sabirpur, Mehran Gulzar and Elaha Sorur, the lone female finalist. ""Art is in the blood of Afghans and has been for centuries, and it is still,"" Sorur said. ""During the years of fighting, the people haven't been able to use their artistry, but with time, it will get better and better. Afghanistan and the people of Afghanistan are ready for a change."" But not everyone is happy with Mohseni's programming choices. Afghanistan's guardians of Islamic values, the Ulema Council, protested that ""Afghan Star"" and Tolo TV's popular Indian soap operas were not part of Afghan culture. Afghanistan's minister for information and culture even tried to stop the soap operas in court, claiming that it was a question of national security. Mohseni pointed out that Afghanistan is sandwiched between two powerful neighbors: India, with a population of 1.1 billion, and Iran, with almost 70 million people (compared with Afghanistan's estimated 34 million). ""You just have to sit down with your critics and explain that if we don't have Afghan music and entertainment, Bollywood will take over,"" he said. ""We're just trying to hold our own in the middle of what is effectively a cultural war."" That culture war can be seen on Tolo TV. After meeting with the Ulema Council, Mohseni dreamed up another reality show called ""Tartil,"" or ""Koran Star."" The three finalists were quizzed by religious authorities and judged on how well they've memorized passages from the Quran, Islam's holy book. There were no wild ovations when the winner was announced, but the finale still produced a bombshell: The winner was a shy 16-year-old schoolgirl named Uzra Mohamedi, who accepted the oversized $3,500 check without cracking a smile and while dressed in a traditional black veil. Other TV programming in Afghanistan includes state-run news and lifestyle shows, a popular local-produced drama about an extended Afghan family, a sketch comedy show -- and the hit Kiefer Sutherland show ""24."" Mohseni says that ""Afghan Star"" pushes his country forward in subtle ways, for instance teaching a few valuable lessons in democracy. Winners are picked by fans who can vote on their mobile phones -- one Sim card, one vote. In previous elimination rounds, losers sometimes stormed off the set, refusing to accept defeat. But now they thank their supporters and graciously congratulate the winners. ""This is the educational component of our show, and hopefully it'll rub off on our politicians,"" Mohseni said. To coincide with Afghanistan's presidential elections in August, Mohseni created a reality show called ""The Candidate"" as a way to encourage a more robust political debate. Six young Afghans face off in mock presidential debates and compete in American-style election campaigns. In the future, Mohseni hopes the direction of Afghan culture will be decided democratically, without traditionalists imposing values by force or government edicts. Either way, Tolo TV has an avid audience: According to Mohseni, the finals of both ""Afghan Star"" and ""Koran Star"" won their nights' ratings races, easily beating the competition.","""Afghan Star"" is Afghanistan's version of ""American Idol""

Watch Lisa Ling share her sister's story Â» . Lisa Ling said that before they left the United States, the pair never intended to cross into North Korea. They have acknowledged that they briefly did, however, and they were convicted of entering the country illegally to conduct a ""smear campaign"" against the reclusive Communist state. They were sentenced in June to 12 years of hard labor. North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, pardoned the women Tuesday after meeting with former President Bill Clinton. They arrived home the following day. Lisa Ling said her sister was allowed to call the family on four occasions during her five months in captivity. On the last call, Laura Ling specifically requested that Clinton intervene. ""She said that in her opinion -- quote, unquote -- it would have to be President Clinton. It could only be President Clinton to secure the release of herself and Euna. We immediately jumped into action and alerted Vice President Gore,"" Lisa Ling said. When their release was secured, they promptly boarded a plane home. Clinton wanted them to rest because they were clearly tired, ""but the two of them were chatting away and comparing their experiences,"" Lisa Ling said. Laura Ling and Lee went to see doctors Thursday, the sister added. Laura Ling is ""doing well,"" and Lee is ""skinny,"" Lisa Ling said, joking that her mother tried to force-feed Lee on Thursday ""because she's just become so diminutive."" The women also are slowly working to assimilate to their freedom. They were kept at opposite ends of the same North Korean detention facility, and though Laura Ling had two guards in her room at all times, she would sometimes go weeks without talking to anyone.  Watch as Lisa Ling describes the pair's condition Â» . ""So even communicating is a challenge because she sometimes yesterday was even having a hard time getting full sentences out, so it's a slow adjustment,"" Lisa Ling said. On Thursday, Lisa Ling told CNN that her sister was ""incredibly emotional"" and didn't want to be left alone after months of ""relative isolation."" ""Yesterday, she was so exhausted and she wanted to take a quick nap. She kept asking me: 'Are you going to be here when I come back?' "" the sister said Thursday. Emotions have run high in Lee's home as well, Lisa Ling said.  Watch the journalists' family reunions Â» . ""I hear from Euna's husband, Michael, that Hana, their 4-year-old daughter, has not wanted her mother to leave her sight,"" she said.

Lee and her husband went to Laura Ling's house Thursday night for their first pizza since being released, Lisa Ling said Friday. ""The thing that was so wonderful to see was little Hana,"" she said. ""I have never seen her so happy, and we all sort of remarked that it was just a beautiful thing."" Lisa Ling said her sibling will soon share her ""powerful"" story, perhaps in an op-ed piece, but she needs space right now. Lisa Ling, meanwhile, is elated that her sister and Lee are safe. She said she always knew they would come home. ""I believe in the fundamental goodness,"" she said. ""I knew in my heart that at some point, Laura and Euna would be returned back to us.

"(CNN)  -- Arsenal will face Celtic in a mouthwatering all-British tie later this month to decide who reaches the Champions League group stages. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will see his side face an early-season test against Celtic. Scottish side Celtic went into the final qualifying round with a superb 2-0 away win over Dinamo Moscow earlier this week, overturning a 1-0 deficit from the first leg. Arsenal, who reached the semifinals of the Champions League last season where they lost to Manchester United, will be favorites to go through, but according to their former striker Charlie Nicholas, who also played for the Celtic, they will not be relishing the task. ""They would have wanted to avoid each other,"" he told Sky Sports News. ""For Arsenal, the concern is the lack of players they've brought in and injuries. I think it will be very tight."" The first leg matches will be played on August 18 and 19, the same week as the start of the English Premier League season, the return matches are on August 25 or 26. A total of 10 pairings were drawn with the prize for the winners a place in the lucrative group stages of the world's most prestigious club competition. The losers will drop down to play in the Europa League, formerly the UEFA Cup. Five of the pairings feature match-ups between the champions of lower-rated leagues such as Latvia and Cyprus. European governing body UEFA effectively ring fenced five places in the group stages for these sides by separating them in the draw from teams from stronger leagues such as England, Italy and Spain. It has led to a series of intriguing clashes with Panathinaikos of Greece facing Spanish side Atletico Madrid.

"Editor's note: Joseph Cirincione is president of Ploughshares Fund, a nonprofit organization that makes grants to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and the author of ""Bomb Scare: The History and Future of Nuclear Weapons."" He formerly was a senior vice president at the Center for American Progress, a think tank that describes itself as ""progressive,"" and was on the staff of the House Armed Services Committee. Joseph Cirincione says Clinton's trip was the culmination of diplomacy his adminstration began 15 years ago. (CNN) -- President Clinton did more than free two unjustly jailed journalists. He jump-started the successful diplomacy he had begun 15 years earlier. In October 2000, then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Pyongyang. During Bill Clinton's presidency, the administration had locked down North Korea's plutonium production program, which had created enough deadly material for two bombs during the Reagan years. They had stopped all missile tests. They were a few details away from concluding a deal to end these programs completely. But Clinton ran out of time. Enmeshed in Middle East peace talks, Clinton could not get assurances that a presidential visit to North Korea would seal the deal. He passed off the almost completed process to the incoming George W. Bush administration. On March 6, 2001, new Secretary of State Colin Powell said, ""We do plan to engage with North Korea to pick up where President Clinton and his administration left off."" But Bush had different ideas. On March 7, Bush kneecapped Powell. With South Korean President Kim Dae-jung sitting next to him in embarrassed silence, Bush said, ""We look forward to, at some point in the future, having a dialogue with the North Koreans, but any negotiation would require complete verification of the terms of a potential agreement."" The conservative ideologues in the administration froze all discussions with North Korea for an 18-month review. Clinton's hard-earned diplomatic wins were replaced by the Bush Doctrine, summed up by Vice President Dick Cheney: ""We don't negotiate with evil; we defeat it."" The United States would instead overthrow difficult regimes. Serious options for diplomacy with North Korea were set aside. Negotiations were appeasement, the new administration believed, not a tool to advance American security. Then-Undersecretary of State John Bolton said in 2002 and repeats to this day, ""We're not going to reward their bad behavior."" The strategy backfired. North Korea expanded plutonium production, exploded nuclear bombs, tested new missiles and traded nuclear technology to Syria and possibly Burma. North Korea's nuclear and missile programs advanced more in the George W. Bush administration then they had in the Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Clinton administrations combined. Whether by accident or design, the Obama administration reset the diplomatic stage. Administration officials largely ignored North Korea for their first eight months in office. Kim Jong Il responded with provocative statements and actions. It almost spiraled out of control. But the Obama administration's patience -- or just policy drift, we may never know -- paid off. Kim Jong Il's regime got weaker and more isolated. North Korea's main partners, China and Russia, turned against it, the U.N. Security Council imposed tough new sanctions, and Kim's own health deteriorated. Now in a weaker position than at any time in his regime, Kim Jong Il has been on his best behavior for the past few months. This was the time for a power play, and Obama executed perfectly. He chose as his special envoy the most prestigious political figure in America outside the administration. It is a move that was sure to please the North Koreans, showing them the respect they crave, without costing America anything. To capitalize on this breakthrough, the Obama administration must now continue to play large. It should show North Korea what good relations with the United States can lead to. Clinton's 20 hours in Pyongyang could pave the way for renewed diplomatic efforts, including direct dialogue between the United States and North Korea, the re-freezing of North Korea's nuclear program and even North Korea's return to the six-party talks. However, in dealing with the North, actions are more important than words. The Obama administration must seize this moment as an opportunity not only to articulate a plan for North Korean nuclear disarmament but to take concrete steps towards a secure and stable Korean Peninsula. The president should use the momentum Clinton's trip has generated to unfold a comprehensive, consistent regional security strategy. With this success, Bill Clinton has demonstrated what effective diplomacy looks like. He has shown the former Bush officials what they should have done years ago. He may have convinced senior White House strategists that diplomacy is a political winner, paying dividends across issue areas. Two power players, Obama and Clinton, have together taken a giant step forward, advancing the agenda Clinton began 15 years ago. America is the better for it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joseph Cirincione.","Joseph Cirincione: Clinton administration started outreach to North Korea .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- India's lower house of parliament elected a woman as its speaker Wednesday, a first in the male-dominated chamber's history. Meira Kumar was nominated by the ruling Congress party. Meira Kumar is also a member of the ""untouchable"" Dalit class, the lowest rung in the centuries-old caste system in the country. The speaker conducts the proceedings of the house. She will preside over 543 elected members, of which 58 are women. Kumar, 64, was elected to the position unopposed. She was nominated by the ruling Congress party but also had the backing of the alliance led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Women play a prominent role in the politics of India, the world's largest democracy. The South Asian country of 1.1 billion people has a female president, Pratibha Devisingh Patil. And four of the country's political parties, including the Congress Party, are led by women. Hindus believe there are five main groups of people. The last group is the Dalits. They're considered impure and are often forced to work in menial jobs. They drink from separate wells and use different entry ways to come and go from buildings. Dalits number about 250 million in India, about 25 percent of the population, according to the Colorado, U.S.-based Dalit Freedom Network. India's constitution outlaws caste-based discrimination, and barriers have broken down in large cities. Prejudice, however, persists in some rural areas of the country. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.","Meira Kumar a member of the Dalit class -- lowest rung in centuries-old caste system .

"PARIS, France (CNN)  -- The Air France plane that crashed a month ago off the coast of Brazil ""did not break up or become destroyed in flight,"" but bellyflopped intact into the Atlantic Ocean, the French air investigation agency announced Thursday. Relatives and friends of an Air France steward follow his coffin during his funeral last week in Rio de Janeiro. ""The plane went straight down, almost vertically... towards the surface of the water, very very fast,"" air accident investigator Alain Bouillard said. Based on visual study of the physical remains of the Airbus A330 that have been recovered, ""we were able to see that the plane hit the surface of the water flat. Therefore everything was pushed upwards -- everything was pushed from the bottom to the top"" of the plane, he said. The 228 people killed in the crash ""had no time to prepare,"" he said.  Watch more about Flight 447's descent Â» . But Bouillard said he did not have autopsy results from the bodies recovered, and did not know why no one lived through the crash. ""I don't know why nobody survived,"" he said. ""I don't know the intensity of the impact. Perhaps we will find out from the autopsies. Perhaps we will never know."" Bouillard said it was still unclear what caused the crash, the deadliest in Air France's 75-year history. ""Today we are very far from establishing the causes of the accident,"" he said. But there is no reason to ground Airbus A330 airplanes, he said. ""There is no problem with flying these airplanes."" Pressed by a reporter on why he was not ordering the model to stop flying, he said the fleet has flown millions of miles and there are currently 660 of them flying. ""Statistically, this would answer the question,"" he said. Air France 447 was unable to fly on autopilot at the time of the crash, the investigator said. That was because the autopilot was not receiving speed, wind or direction information, he said. ""These tell us that the plane has to be, in this case, directed by the pilot,"" he said. He did not immediately say if the pilots were in control of Air France 447. The last contact with the plane was at 2:10 a.m. local time on June 1. ""Right after that 24 automated messages came through"" about the status of the plane, he said. Those messages were what enabled investigators to determine that the autopilot would not have had enough information to fly the plane, he said. No air-traffic controllers seem to have been monitoring the flight when it went down, investigations have found. It would normally have been ""handed over"" from controllers in South America to others in Africa while flying over the Atlantic, but that did not happen, Bouillard said. ""We want to know why there was no concern in Dakar (in Senegal, west Africa) when this plane was not handed over,"" he said. The plane was flying through severe storms when it went down. Three other flights on similar routes changed course within an hour after Air France 447 flew into the bad weather. A Spanish, French and German flight all experienced turbulence in the same region and diverted as much as 100 km (62 miles) off course to avoid bad weather, Bouillard said. All three flights had problems communicating with air traffic control. Investigators will continue searching for the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder -- commonly known as ""black boxes"" -- until July 10, said Bouillard, of the French air accident investigation agency known as the BEA. ""They normally give a signal for 30 days. We will keep listening another 10 days,"" he said. Air France said Thursday it was of ""capital importance"" to find the recorders, ""which would enable the investigators to analyze the causes of the accident, whatever these may be. No effort must be spared in achieving this end."" Bouillard said investigators would continue to search even after the beacons on the recorders stop signaling, in what he called a ""second phase"" of the search. ""If we could find a part of the plane that we know was near the black boxes, that will give us a clue about where to search,"" he said. The mountainous ocean floor in the search area ranges from 3,280 to 15,091 feet, BEA officials have said in the past, making the search for the recorders -- and the rest of the plane's debris -- difficult. ""It is as if it fell in the Andes,"" Olivier Ferrante, chief of the BEA search mission said last month. French submarines and sensitive U.S. military listening devices are being used in the search. Flight 447 went down in stormy weather while flying from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. Brazil called off the search for bodies on June 27, having found 51 of the 228 people who died when the plunged into the sea, according to the military. Investigators have also found more than 600 parts and structural components of the plane, along with luggage, Bouillard said. They have not found any clothing, he said, but was unable to say why.","Air France plane that crashed in June ""did not break up in flight,"" officials say .

"(CNN) -- Christina Cimino was logging onto Twitter on Thursday morning when something happened that she found deeply unsettling. iReporter David Seaman says Twitter needs a competitor so users don't panic when it goes down. ""I got some weird error message, and I'm like, 'What's going on!?"" the 24-year-old said. That error message was the scourge of online social networkers worldwide on Thursday as cyber-attacks shut down Twitter and caused sustained glitches in other social-media sites like Facebook and the blogging site LiveJournal. Twitter co-founder Biz Stone wrote the sites were the victims of what ""appears to be a single, massively coordinated attack."" And a pro-Georgian blogger, whose accounts on Facebook and Twitter reportedly were the targets of the denial-of-service attack, told CNN the online strike was timed to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the Russia-Georgia conflict. What may prove more lasting about the day social networking suffered its first major blackout is the degree to which people cared. Near-panic erupted in some corners of the Internet as people lost cherished links to their online friends, family members and news feeds. Watch CNN iReporters talk about the attack . Part of the panic relates to the sheer popularity of the sites. Twitter saw a more than 1,300 percent jump in unique visitors between February 2008 and February 2009, according to Nielsen NetView. The site, which lets users post messages of 140 characters or less, had more than 44 million worldwide users in June, according to comScore. More than 120 million users log onto Facebook at least one time each day, the site says. To be sure, not all Facebook and Twitter users freaked out because of the attacks. Some people even reveled in the mayhem. Blog: Could the attacks be our fault? But for people like Cimino, who said she ""felt naked"" without access to Twitter, the attacks were a serious reality check -- a chance to evaluate just how dependent they'd become. ""You know how you pat your pockets for your cell phone and your keys? Well it's that same kind of phantom [limb] with Twitter,"" she said. ""It's like, 'I can't update! I can't update!' It's just one of those bugs that gets in you."" She added: ""I was pretty upset, actually. It feels like a lifeline for me ... Pretty much everyone knows almost every detail of my life by what I'm doing on Twitter."" It's not worth analyzing whether these online connections are good or bad because the reality is that Twitter and Facebook are now an important part of our lives, said Marc Cooper, a journalism professor at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication. ""For many people, and not just young people, the Web is not just media, it's actually a place where they conduct their lives or a portion of their lives,"" he said. ""So the panic [Thursday] morning is only reflective of that. This is not just a hobby or an amusement or another accoutrement, it's actually deeply woven into their lives and is integral to their social interaction. So when it's cut off, it's a problem."" Others saw Twitter's existence as the problem and relished the chance to make fun of a Web site that has become so omnipresent in news cycles. ""Horrors!!! People will have to communicate face to face!"" one user commented on CNN's SciTech blog. Another commenter said, ""Turn off your computers and read a book or get outside and discover there is more to life than cyberspace. The Internet has become nothing more than the new cocaine."" Now that Twitter is back online, the No. 1 conversation thread on the site is called ""whentwitterwasdown,"" where users discuss what they did without their real-time Twitter updates. Some people are mocking the blackout. A user named PaulWilks, for instance, wrote, ""I took up juggling."" Others seem concerned. ""I did absolutely nothing. It's like my heart was gone,"" wrote a user named HarajukuxBarbie. ""I felt so empty inside,"" wrote another Twitter user called freinhar. Some business people on Thursday realized just how much they depend on Facebook and Twitter to do their work. Adam Ostrow, editor-in-chief at Mashable, a blog that covers social media, said the outage made it difficult for his organization to cover the news and to promote its stories. ""For someone like myself who spends all day on Twitter, it's incredibly frustrating,"" he told CNN.com Live . Justin Stauffer, a 31-year-old who works in Web strategy at a marketing company near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, said Thursday's attack made him realize just how dependent on Twitter he had become. ""When something that's so central to how you do your business or how you gather information goes down, yeah, you get a little jittery -- like, when's it going to be back,"" he said. ""I didn't break out in hives or anything like that,"" he said, jokingly. David Seaman, an iReporter in New York, said he thinks Twitter needs a competitor so users will have an alternative if the site is down. Watch Seaman's talk about the issue on CNN's iReport . And Amy Gahran, who writes about social media on a blog called Contentious, said all technologies can break down, so people need to make contingency plans. ""Hell, when you get down to it, you can lose your voice or break your writing hand or have a stroke and be unable to communicate. We are fundamentally social creatures, and when we lack our usual communication channels it's scary,"" she writes. ""Don't panic. Have a backup plan, and be prepared."" Cooper, the USC professor, said the fuss surrounding Thursday's attack is a sign that instant, online communication is here to stay. Fighting the trend would be like trying to stop the ocean's tides, he said, but it's unclear where the technology will take our society. ""The bottom line is that we don't know. All of this is too new,"" he said. ""It's like sitting around in the year 1500 and trying to figure out where the printing press was going to take us.""","Some Twitter and Facebook users panicked as the sites went down Thursday .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The regional airline involved in a fatal February plane crash outside Buffalo, New York, contested a report Monday alleging the pilot did not have the training to handle the emergency that brought the plane down, and that he might have been fatigued on the night of the crash. Debris is cleared from the scene of Flight 3407's crash near Buffalo, New York, in February. Continental Connection Flight 3407, operated by regional carrier Colgan Air, plunged into a house in Clarence Center, New York, on the night of February 12, killing all 49 on board as well as one man in the house. In a story Monday, The Wall Street Journal cited investigators as saying the crash resulted from pilot Marvin Renslow's incorrect response to the plane's precarious drop in speed: He overrode an emergency system known as a ""stick pusher,"" which sends the plane into a dive so it can regain speed and avoid a stall. The Journal's report said Colgan had not provided Renslow with hands-on flight-simulator training for a stick-pusher emergency. Colgan, in rebuttal, issued a statement saying Renslow had received classroom instruction for such an emergency.  Watch a Colgan official respond to questions Â» . The company also emphasized that the Federal Aviation Administration does not require pilots to receive a stick-pusher demonstration in a flight simulator. ""The FAA generally trains to standards of routine line operations. They don't focus on the edges of the envelope,"" stall recovery expert Doug Moss told CNN. Colgan further admitted that during his career, Renslow failed five ""check rides"" -- occasional tests of pilot proficiency -- including two that Colgan said he did not disclose on his application with the airline. His most recent failed check ride occurred 16 months before the crash. ""In the cases while with Colgan, he received additional training and successfully passed the check rides,"" the airline said. Colgan stressed that despite his performance on check rides, Renslow nonetheless ultimately passed his pilot exams and had ""all the training and experience to safely operate the Q400,"" the airplane involved in the crash. Colgan further insisted that pilot fatigue was not a factor in the crash, noting that Renslow had ""nearly 22 consecutive hours of time off before he reported for duty on the day of the accident."" In its statement, Colgan did not specifically address potential illness-related fatigue in 24-year-old co-pilot Rebecca Shaw, who, according to The Wall Street Journal report, said before takeoff that she probably should have called in sick. The National Transportation Safety Board begins a three-day hearing on the crash on Tuesday. Renslow's history as well as pilot training broadly will be examined.","Continental Connection Flight 3407 crashed near Buffalo in February; 50 people died .

"(CNN) -- Long before fish swam in Macquariums, hipsters got Apple logo tattoos and thousands camped out for days to get into computer store openings, there was a machine. Danielle Brecker found this 1989 photo of friends on their Macs at Drexel University in Philadelphia. Saturday marks the 25th anniversary of the original Macintosh, the first personal computer to draw masses, introduce the mouse and incorporate a graphical user interface, relying on images instead of text. The Apple Inc. watershed product entered American consciousness amid fanfare, with a $1.5 million commercial, made by Ridley Scott, wowing audiences during Super Bowl XVIII. The piece's title, ""1984,"" invoked author George Orwell's message and stood as a warning against conformity. Two days after the ad ran, the Macintosh became available and life, as people knew it, changed. No longer were computers viewed as toys with which to play primitive games or as untouchable tools reserved for degreed engineers. We began to think different. ""The Macintosh demonstrated that it was possible and profitable to create a machine to be used by millions and millions of people,"" said Alex Soojung-Kim Pang, research director for the Institute for the Future, a Palo Alto, California, think tank, and chief force behind ""Making the Macintosh: Technology and Culture in Silicon Valley,"" an online historical exhibit. ""The gold standard now for personal electronics is, 'Is it easy enough for my grandmother to use it?' People on the Macintosh project were the first people to talk about a product in that way."" Pang, 44, remembered being ""mesmerized"" by the computer when he first saw it up close in his college bookstore. He wasn't alone. Read about how iReporters are preserving Mac history . For graphic designers like ZoÃ« Korstvedt, now a Los Angeles creative director, the evolving Mac, with each added feature, was ripe with ah-ha moments. To tinker with a piece, play with the text, ""to visualize on your computer was just insane,"" she said. ""My colleagues and I wonder how we did it [their jobs] before."" No wonder, then, that when Korstvedt, 44, married her first husband in 1989, she used half of their wedding money to buy her first home computer: a Mac SE/30, for which she forked over extra bucks for an upgrade to a whopping 8 megabytes of RAM. Nothing compared to the 12 gigs she now has. ""I was styling,"" she said with a laugh. Jeremy Mehrle, 30, of the St. Louis, Missouri, area is too young to know a world without Macs. This MacAddict began hoarding and tinkering with tossed-out computers, and then he discovered eBay. Today, the motion graphics designer's 1,400 square-foot basement is a museum to Apple computers, all-white and in gallery-style with about 80 fully-functioning machines on display. ""Some people think it's really cool. ... Others say 'It's Jeremy's thing, it's a little weird, whatever,'"" he said. ""I think if I had stacks everywhere, and you couldn't move in my house, people would be worried."" What's Mehrle's hobby, however, became a career for Dan Foust, 38, of Bloomington, Illinois. ""Danapplemacman,"" as he's known on eBay, makes a living out of buying, and when necessary resuscitating, these computers before hawking them online to customers/collectors in places as far-flung as Italy and Australia. So what would people pay for an original Macintosh? ""A complete boxed system?,"" he said. ""I can't put a price on that."" The extremes to which people have gone in their love and loyalty for Apple (and specifically Macs) knows no bounds. Perhaps no one knows this better than Leander Kahney, news editor at Wired.com and author of Cult of Mac, as well as the more recently published Inside Steve's Brain. That would be Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' brain, of course. From his phone in a San Francisco coffee shop, Kahney told tales of people allotting their limited vacation time to Macworld conferences, a man who has traveled to 40 Apple store openings and those who shaved Apple logos into their heads. As for the Apple tattoos, those, at first, really bothered him. ""I'm a bit of a leftie,"" he said. The idea of ""corporate worship"" didn't initially sit well with him -- although he's not afraid to admit his own obsession. ""It's a very deep relationship people have with their computers. ... If the computer's not working, it's more important than the car breaking down."" Speaking of worship, Israeli filmmakers Ron and Kobi Shely created ""MacHEADS: The Movie,"" a 50-minute documentary that'll be available next week on Amazon's video on demand service and, soon after, on iTunes. The film includes footage from The Church of Mac in Los Angeles, where a preacher and congregants gathered to glorify the computer at a service that ended with, ""Praise Steve."" ""Although we read a lot about the [Mac] phenomenon,"" Ron Shely said by phone from Tel Aviv of the two-year film project, ""we didn't realize how big this social movement really is."" And that, beyond the products, is what has been so powerful about the Mac brand, said Peter Friess, president of The Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose, California. iReport.com: Got your own Mac Museum? Show us! Steve Jobs ""really has changed the world,"" Friess said. ""You hardly find people who changed cultures. He changed culture."" Decades before Jobs' health became a topic of discussion, Friess was lucky enough to meet the man. At the time, German-born Friess was a lowly watchmaker, repairing clocks in the basement of Munich's Deutsches Museum, the largest science and technology museum in the world. The year was 1984, and Friess thought a Macintosh might come in handy, so he called Apple Germany to see if he might be able to get one. The answer, as he recalled it, ""'You're very lucky. Steve Jobs is in town. We'll come over and give you one.'"" Ever since, he's been amazed and exceedingly intrigued by every new computer. ""My wife goes crazy,"" Friess, 49, admitted. ""Every Apple computer I buy, the first thing I do is take it apart, just to see what's inside."" For Gary Allen, 61, of Berkeley, California, his interest is less inside than it is outside the company's stores. He runs ifoAppleStore.com, the first three letters taken from his police dispatch days, meaning ""in front of."" The site's genesis dates back to 2001 when Apple store No. 9 opened, in Palo Alto, and he and his son went early. Way early -- as in the night before. The crowds, and natural community, grew on Allen, who began seeing new-found friends at other openings. They were like groupies chasing a band. So he started a Web site, to help fans keep in touch, and soon other Apple enthusiasts began writing from across the globe, sharing tips about new stores, as well as testimonies and photos. The site, he said, averages about 4 million visitors a month. Allen, who guessed he's been to 22 store openings so far, once stood in the rain for days in Tokyo so he could snag the first spot in line. He's seen old friends at openings in Germany and Italy. Last summer, he and his now 21-year-old son experienced what he called ""the perfect storm,"" hitting Boston, Beijing and Sydney. Next stop: Paris. He may not speak the same language as the thousands who surround him in these various cities, but that doesn't much matter when people speak the same language of computer love. ""Apple enthusiasts, it turns out,"" Allen said, ""are the same wherever you go.""","Saturday marks the 25th anniversary of the first Macintosh computer .

"(CNN) -- A former professional football player and his ex-girlfriend have been charged in the killing of her wealthy boyfriend for money, a breakthrough in a cold case dating to 1994. Eric Naposki, a former football player, has been charged in the killing of an ex-lover's boyfriend. Eric Naposki and Nanette Packard McNeal face the possibility of life sentences over the shooting of Bill McLaughlin, according to the Orange County, California, district attorney. Authorities said Packard McNeal persuaded her ex-boyfriend to kill McLaughlin so she could claim a $1 million life insurance policy, inherit $150,000 and get the right to live in his beach house for a year. She gave Naposki a key to McLaughlin's house and information about when he would be home, officials said Wednesday. Naposki shot the victim six times, then went to work at a nearby nightclub where he was a bouncer, according to authorities. Packard McNeal met McLaughlin after she ran a personal ad that said, ""I know how to take care of my man if he knows how to take care of me,"" the district attorney said in a statement. He supported her financially when they were dating and bought her a beach house, authorities said. Packard McNeal has been jailed once for writing checks to herself from McLaughlin's account without his knowledge, including a $250,000 check on the day he was killed. She pleaded guilty to that crime in 1996 and was jailed for a year. The Orange County officials said new evidence prompted the arrests of the two suspects, who were charged with special circumstances murder for financial gain. Packard McNeal is due to appear in court Friday. Naposki was arrested in Connecticut, where he lives. Orange County authorities have asked that he be sent to California to face trial. Naposki, 42, played in the NFL for the New England Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts.","Former player Eric Naposki and Nanette Packard McNeal could face life sentences .

"(CNN) -- George Sodini, the man who killed three women and wounded nine others before killing himself Tuesday at a Pennsylvania fitness center, showed in his writings typical characteristics of a mass murderer, experts say. George Sodini failed at every relationship but couldn't blame himself, experts say. ""What distinguishes the mass murderer who takes his own life afterwards from the person who just commits suicide is the externalization of blame,"" said James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University professor of criminal justice and author of six books on mass murder. ""If you blame yourself for your problems, then maybe you direct your violence inwardly. If you blame other people for your failures, like Sodini did, you go after those people."" Sodini's blog vents his frustration and rage at the lack of relationships and sex in his life, and he blames all women for letting him down. Although Sodini expressed intense hatred for his brother and father, ""it also didn't surprise me in this case that he made some derogatory comments about his mother,"" said Dr. J. Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist and clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego. ""A lot of times, when there's this level of hatred against women, there's also a very antagonistic relationship with the mother, but it gets shifted onto other women.""  Watch what Sodini reveals about himself on video Â» . Sodini did not target specific women who had hurt him but all women, Fox said. ""He had an issue with women who were not giving him the time of day -- all these young, beautiful, attractive, healthy, fit women at the health club,"" Fox said. ""And so he specifically chose the health club, not just some random spot, to go after the people he blamed."" Mass killers feel that they have been victimized and that their actions are justified, Fox and Meloy said. ""They've been victimized by someone at work, by someone in the family, by the world in general; they've been dealt a bad hand,"" Fox said. ""And ... they feel at the very end they can stand up -- with a gun -- and restore that power imbalance. They often see the gun as the great equalizer. ""This act, this final act of murder, is a way to leave this world feeling some degree of satisfaction of, in the end, being the last one to have the best and last laugh,"" Fox said.  See a timeline of mass shootings since 2005 Â» . ""The concept here is really, really hard for most people to grasp, and that is the sense of entitlement, that 'I have a right to murder all of these women because of my personal frustration,' "" Meloy said. ""It's absolutely astonishing that a person can come to that mind-set."" Neither expert treated Sodini, but both noted that Sodini's act, like most mass murders, was anything but spontaneous. ""His blog is a striking example of how mass murders are planned, relatively carefully planned, over the course of days, weeks or, in this case, months,"" Meloy said. ""There's this myth that mass killers just snap and go berserk and suddenly, without warning, shoot indiscriminately,"" Fox said. ""Well, he had been thinking about this for some time. He had originally planned to commit the mass murder in January [but] 'chickened out,' as he said. But this shows a lot of methodical planning, thinking."" That hesitation, as well as his possible hesitation on the day of the killings, is unusual, Meloy said. ""Typically, as these guys are doing it, they have no ambivalence,"" he said. ""The have made the decision to maximize casualties and to also kill themselves, as he did."" Often some humiliating event ""starts the clock"" and sets long-laid plans in motion, Meloy said, but he didn't see evidence of such an incident in the hours or days before Sodini's rampage. ""These guys are very narcissistically sensitive, meaning that the kind of insult or slight that you or I would just fluff off, these guys will ruminate and think about it and do that for long periods of time,"" Meloy said. Sodini was not a bad-looking man; he was intelligent and had a good job, so his failure to attract women must have had something to do with his behavior, Meloy said. But Sodini couldn't see that. ""He had difficult and unhappy and unsuccessful relationships with everybody,"" Fox said. ""What he was never able to do was to see that perhaps the problem was him. Maybe there's a reason why everybody rejects him, no one wants to be close to him. Maybe it's something about his own personality. ""But mass murderers don't look at things that way. If they saw themselves as being the culprit, perhaps they would just commit suicide. But no. Everyone else is to blame.""","George Sodini's writings reveal typical characteristics of mass killers, experts say .

"(CNN) -- The news editor of the Zambian newspaper The Post has gone on trial for allegedly circulating obscene material to politicians, the newspaper states on its Web site. Zambia President Rupiah Banda has branded the childbirth photos pornographic. In early June, Chansa Kabwela wrote to the country's vice president, health minister and several non-governmental organizations to highlight problems in the country's health-care system -- especially the problems pregnant women faced during a strike by health-care workers. In her letter, Kabwela included several photos of a woman giving birth in a parking lot outside a hospital from which she had been turned away, according to Reporters Without Borders. The country's president, Rupiah Banda, branded the photos pornographic and called for Kabwela's arrest and prosecution, according to the press freedom organization. ""Kabwela's arrest is shocking and the grounds are ridiculous,"" the organization said in a statement on its Web site after the arrest. Now the trial into the alleged obscene photos has begun in the Lusaka magistrate's court, the newspaper Web site says. One of the first witnesses, Kenneth Ngosa, a senior private secretary to the vice president, told the court he was immediately disturbed by the pictures he found inside the letter, according to the paper. The Post described the courtroom as ""packed to capacity"" and said ""people from all works of life including musicians and opposition political party members"" had come to support Kabwela. Defense lawyer George Chisanga has asked the court to look into whether the president's order to arrest and prosecute Kabwela could influence the course of justice. A joint statement from several Zambian media organizations, published on The Post's Web site, calls for the government to amend the law on obscenity to clarify what constitutes obscenity and material that can corrupt morals. The statement concedes that the pictures were in bad taste, but notes that they were sent on behalf of a good cause: to end the strike. CNN efforts to obtain comment from both The Post and the Zambian government have been unsuccessful. According to the latest figures from the World Health Organization, in 2004 the mortality rate of children under 5 years old in Zambia was 182 per 1,000 live births. In the United States, under-5 mortality rate was 8 per 1,000 live births in 2006. Skilled health personnel attended only 43 percent of childbirths in Zambia in 2002, according to the health organization.","News editor of Zambian newspaper on trial for circulating obscene material .

"(CNN) -- The mysterious deaths of 21 prized polo horses Sunday at a club in Florida provides a peek inside the private world of a sport that generally is off limits to all but the very wealthy. The Lechuza Caracas polo team may not recover from the loss of 21 ponies for years, a polo executive says. The University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine in Gainesville and the state-run Kissimmee Diagnostic Laboratories near Orlando are conducting necropsies on the animals. Initial tests failed to reveal a cause, said Liz Compton, a representative of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Tissues, organ samples and blood are now being screened for toxic agents, she said. Scientists have ruled out any contagious disease because the animals died so quickly, said state Agriculture Department spokesman Mark Fagan. Authorities initially requested necropsies for only the eight horses that were insured, according to Sarah Carey, a representative of the veterinary school, which got the bodies of 15 horses. Later, the order was expanded to all 15 horses, she said. The U.S. Polo Association is among the parties cooperating in the investigation. ""In the meantime, we all mourn the loss of these horses,"" U.S. Polo Association Executive Director Peter Rizzo said in a news release. ""There are no words to describe the grief and sadness shared by everyone -- particularly the devastated owners of those magnificent horses.""  Watch what investigators are studying Â» . Players form strong emotional bonds with the horses they ride, said John Wash, operations president of the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Wellington, Florida, where the horses fell ill. ""I've heard a couple of polo players who were affected with this loss the other day, a couple of them I don't think have left their house since Sunday night,"" Wash said. ""There were a lot of tears there -- these big, tough guys just on their hands and knees, crying over what happened."" The U.S. Open Polo Championship that was interrupted by the tragedy will resume Wednesday with semifinal matches, Wash said. Lechuza Caracas, the team whose horses died, was offered spare mounts from other competitors so they could remain in the competition, but the devastated team chose to withdraw, Wash said. The Wellington tournament is one of the sport's three major championships, on a par with the U.S. Open in tennis or golf. Authorities say they believe that the competition facility is safe for the other horses and that whatever killed the 21 horses entered their bodies away from the site. Fifteen of the animals fell ill shortly before they were to compete Sunday; some died immediately and others lingered for almost an hour. Six others died overnight Sunday to Monday as they were kept in the same trailer in Wellington. Animals are not kept overnight at the competition site, so no special precautions are in place regarding food, water or bedding, Wash said. Organizers are planning a short memorial and laying of wreaths in honor of the horses, he said. Grief counselors are on hand at the facility to help employees deal with the trauma, Wash said. ""The scene can be described as almost like an airplane crash that involved not human life, but horses,"" he said. ""It was horrific."" Polo ponies in the United States are not drug-tested, but the U.S. Polo Association has been considering taking up the practice for several years, Wash said. ""People are calling for reform, and maybe that needs to happen, but until toxicology reports come back, and autopsy reports, we don't even know if [Sunday's incident is] anything related to that."" The Humane Society of the United States has no record of abuse of polo ponies, but that may be a function of the sport's exclusive nature, society spokeswoman Holly Hazard said. ""We are learning about this, as is everyone else,"" she said. ""It may be that perhaps because it's not televised or not as popular as other sports, it's not something that either our constituents or our program is particularly focused on. ""But if there are either performance-enhancing drugs or some problem that is associated with this, we will investigate and we will offer a reward to bring whoever is responsible to justice."" Keith Dane, director of the Humane Society's equine protection program, was en route to Florida on Tuesday to interview people involved in the incident and keep an eye on the investigation, Hazard said. No evidence has been brought forth suggesting someone deliberately poisoned the animals. ""I guess everything's possible,"" Wash said. ""I've heard all different rumors. I don't know if I even want to go there and think about that."" Compton, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services representative, said authorities have seen no evidence of criminal activity in the case. ""Clearly, law enforcement has gotten involved, given the complexity and the scope of the deaths, and they are fact-finding and gathering information, and once we have a specific cause of death, then they can determine where their investigation will go,"" she said. The devastated team, Lechuza Caracas, is one of the top teams in the world. The loss could set it back for years, Wash said. ""It's just like baseball or basketball or football,"" he said. ""You're taking years of grooming, training, nurturing to create, really, a first string of horses. And for four polo players, it takes anywhere from six to eight horses per polo player to play a game of polo. So if you're taking 21 horses, they're probably 21 of your first-string horses ... and you've just lost every one of your best players. ""It's not like you could just go out and buy 21 new horses and start at that point."" Polo ponies are thoroughbreds, many of them former racehorses retrained for the game, but they cover a wide range of ages, Wash said. When they get too old to play, they are retired to pasture or stud, he said. ""A polo horse is treated quite well,"" Wash said. ""In fact, when you're a polo horse, you might play three months here in Palm Beach, you might take three months off, you might play another three months, say, in Argentina or England, you take three months off. They're not pushed 12 months out of the year."" CNN's Kim Segal and John Couwels contributed to this report.","Investigators try to determine what killed 21 polo ponies in Florida .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Is there a filmmaker in the world with worse luck than Terry Gilliam? He was directing Heath Ledger in ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus,"" when the actor died -- and it's not the first time he has lost a leading man. Is there a filmmaker in the world with worse luck than Terry Gilliam? Jean Rochefort didn't die eight years ago, but Gilliam had to abandon ""The Man Who Killed Don Quixote"" after a few days when 70-year-old star Rochefort became seriously ill and a flash flood washed away the entire set. The whole fiasco is captured in the documentary ""Lost in La Mancha."" But the animator-turned-director who made his name with the surreal opening sequences of ""Monty Python"" is also known for never giving up. He saved ""Parnassus"" by enlisting the help of Ledger's friends, among them Johnny Depp. He has even resurrected ""Don Quixote,"" which will start shooting next year. The Screening Room talks to ""The Fisher King"" and ""Brazil"" director about Heath Ledger, the Ibiza Film Festival and why he'll never shake off the Monty Python label. The Screening Room: Heath Ledger's death during ""Parnassus"" was tragic, but how did you deal with losing your star in the middle of production? Terry Gilliam: I was just, it's like, now you've got to use your imagination because reality has bitten very hard. And, so, you call your friend Johnny [Depp] and say, ""Heath just died. Can you help me?"" And he says, ""Fine, whatever. Whatever you need. I'll do it."" That's how it started. Then I got Jude [Law] and Colin [Farrell], they came ... the point is that they were all friends of Heath, too. It had to be people that were close to him in order to do what we did. TSR: How do you feel about it now you've had some time to reflect? TG: The experience was awful. That's why we can laugh now. Making films is really hard, and this one was particularly hard. TSR: What is the most rewarding part of making films? TG: I don't know, I mean, you know, writing and coming up with the ideas -- that's the exciting bit. Then it's the slog of just getting through the shoot because there is never enough time . TSR: You are a patron of the Ibiza Film Festival, which is only three years old. How did that come about? TG: The festival of Ibiza approached me a couple of years ago. John Hurt was already a patron, and I know John and I thought that it would be nice. I like being a patron of things, I like patronizing things. And if it's not going to be people, I'll patronize a festival. TSR: Why do you think film festivals are important? TG: The most important thing about them is you get to see films you would never get to see because the distribution system is so dominated by Hollywood. In every country, you get Hollywood movies plus local movies. Beyond that it's very hard. TSR: Tell us about how directing ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" your big feature directing break, came about? TG: With the success of ""Python,"" we decided to make ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" and Terry Jones [fellow Monty Python member] and I said, ""Anybody named Terry gets to direct the film,"" and the others foolishly agreed. We directed the film and our names went up as ""directed by,"" and we were film directors. Bingo! Just like that. TSR: ""Monty Python"" was hugely successful, but is the downside that you'll never shake off the label of being an ex-Python? TG: Python is going to be stuck with me 'til I'm dead and probably afterwards. That's what's gonna be on the grave, as well. I know exactly what I'd like put on my gravestone: ""Terry Gilliam. RIP and all that. He giggled in awe."" TSR: What is your film philosophy? TG: All films are learning processes. I am still trying to work out how you make a movie. I didn't study at film school or any of those things. I didn't bother with film theory. Mine is the Mary Poppins theory of film -- a bit of sugar helps the medicine go down. And I have always got medicine I want to give to people. TSR: Which film are you most proud of? TG: ""Brazil"" is the one that will probably be stamped on my grave because that one seemed to have made a big effect on a lot of people. And that's all I'm trying to do is affect people. TSR: What have you learned over the 30-plus years you have been making films? TG: There is no one thing -- it's just going through life. I don't think you ever learn just one thing. At some point you start unlearning things. I have been working hard to unlearn everything I know. TSR: Where are you with ""Don Quixote?"" TG: ""Quixote..."" It's been almost eight years since it fell on its little face. We had been trying to get the script back from the legal entanglement it was in ... and finally pulled that off. I had in those intervening years never read the script because I knew it was the best thing I had ever written. It was perfect -- I finally did it. I got it back and re-read it and have now been busy rewriting it. TSR: What advice would you offer to aspiring filmmakers? TG: Talent is less important in filmmaking than patience. If you really want your films to say something that you hope is unique, then patience and stamina, thick skin and a kind of stupidity, a mule-like stupidity, is what you really need.","Ledger died while shooting Gilliam's ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Mohammed Ismail was released from the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in early 2004 and sent back to Afghanistan to be set free. A guard talks with a detainee at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, earlier this year. Within four months, the U.S. military said, he was recaptured in Afghanistan attacking U.S. troops there, with paperwork on him that said he was a Taliban in good standing. He is just one of 74 former Guantanamo Bay detainees who the military says were active in, or were suspected of being active in, fighting against the United States or committing terrorist acts after being released. Another is Abdullah Gulam Rasoul, who was released from Guantanamo in December 2007 and set free in Afghanistan. Rasoul has become a powerful Taliban military commander in southern Afghanistan, the military said, and the United States suspects he is responsible for several attacks on U.S. forces there. A senior U.S. military official said he believes Rasoul is using his former Guantanamo experience to build on his ""rock star status"" among the Taliban. Abd al Hadi Abdallah Ibrahim al Shaikh of Saudi Arabia, who was released in 2007, was arrested in 2008 by Saudi authorities on suspicion of supporting terrorism inside that country, the military said. On Tuesday, the Pentagon released information that showed 14 percent of former detainees have turned to, or are suspected of having turned to, terrorism activity since being released from Guantanamo. The data represent the most recent statistics of former detainees tracked by military and other U.S. government intelligence agencies. The report shows that of the more than 530 detainees released from the prison, 27 have been confirmed to have engaged in terrorist activities and 47 are suspected of participating in some kind of terrorist act. The statistics indicate that there has been a slight increase since the end of 2008, and the number of released detainees turning to or suspected of turning to the insurgency is almost doubled from the 7 percent in that category a few years ago, according to Pentagon officials familiar with the information. The report said that between December 2008 and March 2009, nine former detainees were added to the confirmed list, six of whom were moved over from the suspected list. The Pentagon's definition for ""suspected"" is significant reporting indicating a person is involved in terrorist activities and an analysis showing a match to an identity of a former detainee. The report defines ""confirmed"" as a preponderance of evidence, including fingerprints, DNA, photo match or reliable or well-corroborated intelligence that can identify a former detainee at Guantanamo. In January, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said 62 former Guantanamo detainees may have gone on to participate in terrorism or military activity. That number included 18 who had been directly tied to an attack or attacks and 43 who were suspected of such action, Pentagon officials said at the time. ""What's clear is we are not seeing recidivism on the decline,"" according to a defense official who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman declined to say what officials think is the reason for the numbers having gone up, but said the United States does monitor as best as it can detainees who have been released from Guantanamo. The Pentagon released the names of almost 30 former detainees confirmed or suspected to have gone on to fight, with examples of what these men had done after their release. Abdullah Saleh Ali al-Ajmi, for example, was released in 2005 to Kuwait. In April 2008 he blew himself up in Mosul, Iraq, killing a number of Iraqis, the Pentagon said. Yousef Muhammed Yaaqoub was released from Guantanamo and sent back to Afghanistan to be freed in 2003. The Pentagon documents show that he rejoined the Taliban as a commander in southern Afghanistan, and planned a jailbreak in Kandahar and a ""nearly successful capture of the town of Spin Boldak, Afghanistan."" Yaaqoub was killed fighting U.S. troops on May 7, 2004, according to the Pentagon data, and his memorial service in Pakistan drew a number of wanted Taliban leaders. Other examples released by the Pentagon show men sent home to Morocco who were later captured and accused of recruiting people to train with and fight for al Qaeda in Iraq, two men freed in Saudi Arabia who became leaders in a new al Qaeda organization there, and a Russian sent home who later was arrested for playing a role in a gas line bombing. As a comparison, among prisoners in the United States, about 62 percent of violent offenders examined in a 1994 study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics were rearrested within three years of being released.","Pentagon: 14 percent turn to, or are suspected of turning to, terrorism activities .

"(CNN) -- An autopsy report issued Friday by Hillsborough County, Florida, cites cocaine as a contributing factor in the death of TV pitchman Billy Mays, who died in June at age 50. The Hillsborough County medical examiner's office said cocaine use contributed to Billy Mays' heart disease. ""Mays died from a lethal arrhythmia of the heart caused by hypertensive and arteriosclerotic heart disease,"" the county said in a statement attributed to Dr. Leszek Chrostowski, the associate medical examiner who conducted the autopsy. ""He further concluded that cocaine use caused or contributed to the development of his heart disease, and therefore contributed to his death,"" it added. The fact that toxicology tests detected only breakdown products of cocaine, not the drug itself, led Chrostowski to conclude that Mays had used cocaine ""in the few days prior to death but not immediately prior to death."" Cocaine is a stimulant that can raise blood pressure and thicken the wall of the left ventricle of the heart, one of the organ's four main pumping chambers. The autopsy also found low concentrations of ethyl alcohol ""consistent with social consumption of a few beverages"" as well as the narcotic drugs hydrocodone, oxycodone and tramadol. Mays had prescriptions for the drugs -- which were found in therapeutic or subtherapeutic concentrations -- to ease hip pain. In addition, the tests found evidence of two tranquilizers -- alprazolam (Xanax) and diazepam (Valium) -- which are commonly prescribed for a variety of ailments, including anxiety and insomnia. Both drugs were determined to be in therapeutic or subtherapeutic concentrations. Mays was found dead at his home near Tampa on June 28. Mays, with his booming voice, was famous for fronting products such as OxiClean and Orange Glo in TV commercials.","Cocaine contributed to Billy Mays' death, says autopsy report .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The last British soldier to serve in World War I was buried Thursday, marking ""the passing of a generation,"" the British veterans minister said. The coffin draped in a Union Jack flag is taken away from Well Cathedral. Harry Patch died July 25 at the age of 111, a week after fellow British World War I veteran Henry Allingham died at the age of 113. A party of pallbearers escorting his coffin was made up of two Belgian, two French, and two German infantrymen, while his coffin was carried by six soldiers from a unit that incorporated the one he served in during World War I. Patch was buried in the cathedral in the city of Wells, southwest England, where he lived. He joined the army at the age of 18 and fought in the Battle of Passchendaele at Ypres, Belgium, in 1917. He was seriously wounded in the battle, in which more than 70,000 of his fellow soldiers died -- including three of his close friends. ""Today marks the passing of a generation, and of a man who dedicated his final years to spreading the message of peace and reconciliation,"" Veterans Minister Kevan Jones said. ""Active participation in the Great War is now no longer part of living memory in this country, but Harry Patch will continue to be a symbol of the bravery and sacrifice shown by him and those he served with,"" he said. ""In his passing we have lost our last living link to the fighting in the trenches of the Western Front and a member of a generation that stood firm in the face of extraordinary adversity and unimaginable suffering,"" said Gen. Richard Dannatt, the head of the British army. ""But today above all else we give thanks for the life of a brave and inspirational man whose message of reconciliation and peace has reached and touched so many,"" he said. The funeral was attended by the acting head of the British government and the wife of Prince Charles, among thousands of others, the Ministry of Defence said. Patch was the last British man living in the United Kingdom to have served in the trenches on the Western Front, the Ministry of Defence said. Born in 1898, Patch became a plumber before being conscripted to the army in 1916. His unit, The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, was rushed to the front-line trenches of Ypres, where soldiers were urgently needed to replace those who were wounded and dying by the thousands. He fought in the trenches between June and September of 1917 and was involved in some of the fiercest fighting of the war. In late September he was wounded when a light shell exploded above his head, bringing an end to his military service. He received battlefield treatment without anesthetic. After the war ended in 1918, Patch returned to his work as a plumber and later became a sanitary engineer. He married Ada Billington, a young woman he met while convalescing after the battle. They married in 1919 and had two sons. In World War II, Patch joined the Auxiliary Fire Service and helped tackle the fires caused by heavy German raids on the English cities of Bath and Bristol. At one point he was sent to organize sanitary arrangements for soldiers at a camp near Yeovil, in southwest England, where he became friendly with some of the men. Patch remembered the shock of finding the camp deserted, with coffee still hot and meals half-eaten, on the morning that the soldiers had gone off for the invasion of France, the Ministry of Defence said. His wife, Ada, died in 1976, and their two sons also later died. Patch remarried in 1980, but he became a widower for the second time four years later. Patch didn't speak about the war until he turned 100, the Ministry of Defence said. ""He tried to suppress the memories and to live as normal a life as possible; the culture of his time said that he was fortunate to have survived and that he should get on with his life,"" a Ministry of Defence biography says. ""That suited Harry; he could 'forget' his demons, the memories of what happened to him and to his close friends."" In 1998, a television producer with an interest in the war talked to Patch, who then made the decision to speak of his memories, the ministry said. He took part in a documentary on the war and began gradually to open up. It wasn't long before Patch became a spokesman for his generation, speaking about the horrors of the war as well as his own emotions and reactions, the ministry said. ""In speaking about his experiences, Harry began at last to come to terms with his war, and was at peace with himself and his memories,"" the ministry said. ""His thoughts then turned to reconciliation, to the long-term effects of suffering and coming to terms with that suffering."" Patch returned to Belgium in 2002, something he had said he would never do, and laid a wreath in honor of his battalion, the Defence Ministry said. Two years later, he met and shook hands with a German artilleryman from the Western Front, Charles Kuentz. Patch later laid a wreath at Langemark Cemetery for the German war dead. In his last years, Patch was honored at Buckingham Palace and the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street. On his 101st birthday France awarded him the Knighthood of the Legion of Honor, and this year President Nicolas Sarkozy upgraded that to the rank of officer. Last year, King Albert II of Belgium made Patch a Knight of the Order of Leopold. ""Harry was delighted to receive these awards and wore the medals with great pride, but he always made it clear that he wore these medals as a representative of the selfless generation he had come to represent,"" the Ministry of Defence said. In 2007, Patch wrote a book detailing his life, called ""The Last Fighting Tommy."" The name referred to the slang term for British privates. ""While the country may remember Harry as a soldier, we will remember him as a dear friend,"" said Jim Ross, a close friend. ""He was a man of peace who used his great age and fame as the last survivor of the trenches to communicate two simple messages: Remember with gratitude and respect those who served on all sides, (and) settle disputes by discussion, not war.""","Funeral service held for WWI veteran Harry Patch .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Holly Williams is one of the only artists in country music male or female who doesn't have a stylist. But then again, she might be the only entertainer in Nashville who owns a clothing boutique. Holly Williams is daughter of musician Hank Williams Jr. and granddaughter of musician Hank Williams Sr. The chic women's store is named H. Audrey after her maternal grandmother, who was the first wife of the late country music icon Hank Williams. Holly's father is Bocephus -- the legendary hellraiser and three-time CMA Entertainer of the Year otherwise known as Hank Williams Jr. She got her height from him. With heels on, she's about 6-foot-3 -- all tanned legs and long, blonde hair. She looks like a star. And at 28, she wants to earn the right to be one. Williams just released her sophomore album, ""Here With Me"" (Mercury Nashville). Most of the 11 tracks are self-penned, and she sings them with emotional honesty in a smoky, soulful voice. The characters in her lyrics are friends, family and lovers from the past. She also has a man in her present: On July 24, she became engaged to Chris Coleman, the drummer in her band.  Watch Williams show off her talents Â» . Williams spoke with CNN about her new album and her family's legacy. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Your new album was released the same day as your dad's new album. Was that planned? Holly Williams: It wasn't planned at all. About three weeks before my release, I was looking over to see who else was coming out that day, and it said, ""Hank Jr."" -- and I'm going, ""Is this something my manager planned?"" And it's just so random, because out of the 52 weeks of the year, it just happened. CNN: What did he think about the album? Williams: Well, this is embarrassing, but I haven't sent him a copy yet! I need to. He's heard two of the singles. He's always been a huge supporter of the songwriting, and just been a great encourager with me. CNN: What was it like when you were growing up? Williams: Well, my mom raised my sister and me. [My parents] split when we were 3 and 5, and he was touring 300 nights a year. We'd see him every few months when he was off the road, and we'd go up there and hunt and fish and be on the farm. But my mom did all the rules and curfews and all that. CNN: Your mother doesn't seem jaded by the music industry at all. Williams: Oh, she doesn't at all. They split in '83, so when they first got married in '77, he was still a struggling artist and doing small theater shows. My single out right now is called ""Mama"" that I wrote ... is kind of a thank-you song, because she was always the most positive influence -- had so much light. My dad always talks about what a great mom she was, and they're still close friends. CNN: What was it like for you going into the music industry? Was there a lot of pressure? Williams: The songwriting hit me at a very young age. Eight, 9, 10 is when I started writing. Went away from it for a few years, and at 17 picked up a guitar and it was just on from there. I'm 28 now, and I've been doing it for 10 years nonstop. I put out an EP myself when I was 20, and paid 200 bucks for my Web site, and traveled over in the U.K. alone with a backpack. And in the U.S., I just took my mom's Suburban and followed everyone from Train, John Mellencamp, Billy Bob Thornton -- everyone's bus -- and just did any show I could, whether they paid or not. Just played, played, played. CNN: Do you remember the first song you wrote when you were 8? Williams: I do. The first song I wrote was called ""Who Am I,"" and it's funny because it was very serious. I had a very happy childhood, but it was very introspective about this broken marriage, and I wanted Tiffany or Debbie Gibson to cut it. I remember just telling my mom, ""Just please call the publishing company. ... ""I was so ambitious. I remember making cassette tapes and mailing them to Music Row. CNN: What was the reaction from those tapes? Williams: I'm sure there was never any response. I'm sure people just laughed. I was not as talented as Taylor Swift when I was 15, 16. I could write a decent song, but I couldn't sing that well at that age. CNN: You have a love for rock 'n' roll. Why did you go into country with this album? Williams: Growing up in my house, you would assume I was growing up around country music with my dad being Hank Williams Jr. But he did not bring music home. He always said, ""I'm not Bocephus to you. I'm Daddy."" So I was really left to my own devices to find music on my own. And I really fell in love with the singer-songwriters of the '70s -- Tom Waits, Neil Young, Jackson Browne, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Carole King -- that whole era really struck me. And when I heard Hank Williams Sr.'s name mentioned from those people -- from Leonard Cohen to Bruce Springsteen -- that's what really brought me back around to learning more about my grandfather. My music is still based in that singer-songwriter tradition. Adding a fiddle and steel guitar makes it more country, and adding blazing electric guitars makes it more rock. I'm on a country label now. CNN: You also own a clothing boutique in Nashville called H. Audrey. Williams: Everything I have on, except my shoes, is from there. ... It's a struggle in this economy, but we make enough to pay our payroll and buy the clothes. And it's nice to fold jeans every now and again, and get my mind out of myself. CNN: When you're writing down your goals on your wish list, what is it you really want? Williams: I would love to sell a million records. I would love to play in arenas -- but what I really want to build is a core fanbase, and just hopefully build a place in the Williams family.","Country music scion Holly Williams has new album out, ""Here With Me""

"(CNN) -- Andrew Sable wasn't in the market for new wheels, but he says the federal ""cash for clunkers"" program helped him get an offer he couldn't refuse. ""I'd have been foolish not to take it,"" said Andrew Sable, who got $9,000 for his 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The gas-guzzling 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee his college-student son drives went bad last weekend. Ordinarily Sable would have fixed it, even though the vehicle was worth perhaps $2,000 at best. But, aware of the program that started this month, Sable took a $4,500 federal credit this week to trade in the Jeep and buy a new, more fuel-efficient Chrysler PT Cruiser. And Chrysler, eager to sell vehicles, threw in its own $4,500 incentive. The $9,000 in savings knocked the price to $8,900 before taxes and fees. ""I'll never get $9,000 for this old vehicle [any other way]. I'd have been foolish not to take it,"" the 43-year-old Sable, an insurance underwriter living in North Bellmore, New York, told CNN after filing a report with iReport.com. He'll drive the PT Cruiser and let the son drive his Nissan. iReport.com: Read Sable's account of the purchase . Under the $1 billion program, people will be given credits of $3,500 to $4,500 to replace gas guzzlers -- generally vehicles with a combined city/highway fuel economy of 18 miles per gallon or less -- with new vehicles that are more fuel efficient. The old vehicles are crushed or shredded.  Watch CNN's Gerri Willis explain the ""cash for clunkers"" program Â» . The exact credit offered through the program --- officially called the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009, or CARS -- depends on how many more miles per gallon the new vehicle gets. Fuel economy thresholds for new vehicles vary according to type. New cars must have a combined city/highway fuel economy of at least 22 mpg. New SUVs and small or medium pickup trucks or vans must get at least 18 mpg. New large vans and pickups must get at least 15 mpg. The government put Sable's old Jeep at 15 mpg. His new PT Cruiser, which the program classifies as an SUV, gets a combined 21 mpg. Part of the program's intent is to get vehicles with low fuel efficiency off the road. Caroline Radtke, a 31-year-old who wrote about her purchase on iReport.com, was happy to oblige. Radtke and her husband this month got a $4,500 CARS credit for trading in their 2000 Isuzu Trooper (15 mpg) to buy a new Volkswagen Jetta SportWagen, a diesel-powered car that the program lists as getting 33 mpg. After the credit, they paid just under $26,000. ""What was going out of my [old] vehicle was bad for the planet, and you're putting so much financially into the stupid thing to fill it up because it runs out so fast,"" Radtke, a freelance graphic designer living in San Antonio, Texas, told CNN after filing her iReport. ""After driving it for eight and a half years, I wanted something more productive financially and more friendly to the Earth."" The couple would have bought a new car without CARS, but the credit probably allowed them to get a nicer car than they otherwise would have, Radtke said. If they had sold the Trooper themselves, they might have gotten $3,000 if they were lucky, she said. iReport.com: Radtke's purchase . The CARS program isn't for everyone. The credit won't go toward used-car purchases. Also, people looking to get rid of their under-18-mpg vehicle might find they can get about the same or more than a CARS credit by selling it. But the program worked just fine for iReporter Julie Callahan, a Salt Lake City, Utah, woman who was looking to replace her 1990 Chevy C1500 pickup truck, which had more than 350,000 miles and is rated at 15 mpg. She and her husband already had a newer vehicle, but she used the truck to go to work and for other in-town purposes. But lately it started having shifting problems, and it was occasionally slipping going uphill. Like Sable, Callahan, 39, got $4,500 this week to turn in the old vehicle and buy a new PT Cruiser. And, like Sable, she also received a separate $4,500 credit from Chrysler. She'll be paying about $10,000 for her new vehicle after taxes and fees. The $9,000 she saved with the credits from CARS and Chrysler isn't too shabby, considering she figures her old pickup was nearly worthless because it had so many miles. iReport.com: How Callahan got $9,000 for her truck . ""Without the incentives, I probably wouldn't have purchased a brand new vehicle,"" Callahan, who runs a science outreach program at the University of Utah, told CNN after filing her iReport. Unless it is renewed, the program will end November 1 or when funds allotted by Congress run out, whichever happens first. Trade-ins must be less than 25 years old, and their titles must be free of any liens. Consumers can go to a Web site, cars.gov, to learn the program's rules.

"(CNN) -- Sonia Sotomayor, who rose from humble roots in a Bronx, New York, housing project to a high-powered legal career, was sworn in Saturday as the 111th justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge Sonia Sotomayor takes the judicial oath Saturday as her mother, Celina, holds the Bible. With friends and family looking on, the 55-year-old jurist took the judicial oath in the court's wood-paneled East Conference Room, pledging to ""faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent on me."" It was the first time such a ceremony was televised. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the 62-word oath required of all federal judges. In a private ceremony just moments before, Sotomayor took a separate, constitutional oath across the hall. Both oaths are necessary for her to assume her new duties. As her mother, Celina, held a ceremonial Bible, Sotomayor beamed as she waved to relatives and guests when she entered the room for the public ceremony. Among those in the room was her brother, Juan Sotomayor.  Watch Sotomayor take the oath Â» . Roberts made brief preliminary remarks, telling the audience of about 60 that after the swearing-in, Sotomayor can ""begin her duties as an associate justice without delay."" ""Congratulations and welcome to the court,"" he said afterward. Sotomayor made no statements and did not answer questions. She hugged her mother and several people in the front row. The newest justice can begin moving into her chambers and preparing for the upcoming fall term. The other justices plan to return early from their three-month recess to hear a case September 9 on free speech and campaign finance laws. Sources close to Sotomayor say she has already begun reading up on the caseload, and will soon formally hire four law clerks. She also will have two secretaries and a messenger to assist her. Justice Anthony Kennedy was the only current Supreme Court member on hand for the swearing-in ceremony. David Souter, whom Sotomayor replaces on the bench, was not there. He has retired to New Hampshire. The Senate confirmed Sotomayor on Thursday in a 68-31 vote. President Obama, who did not attend the swearing-in, will welcome his first high court appointee to the White House for a reception Wednesday.  Watch Senate vote Â» . Obama, who selected Sotomayor on May 26, said Thursday he was ""deeply gratified"" by the Senate vote. ""This is a wonderful day for Judge Sotomayor and her family, but I also think it's a wonderful day for America,"" he said in brief remarks. Sotomayor, who watched Thursday's final vote surrounded by friends and family at the federal courthouse in Manhattan, was confirmed after senators spent a final day of debate rehashing the main arguments for and against her. Democrats continued to praise Sotomayor as a fair and impartial jurist with an extraordinary life story. Many Republicans portrayed her as a judicial activist intent on reinterpreting the law to conform with her own liberal political beliefs.  See how Sotomayor measures up to other justices Â» . Sotomayor's confirmation capped an inspiring personal and professional journey. Her parents came to New York from Puerto Rico during World War II. Her father worked in a factory and did not speak English well. She was born in the Bronx and grew up in a public housing project, not too far from the stadium of her favorite team, the New York Yankees. Her father died when she was 9. Her mother, whom Sotomayor has described as her biggest inspiration, worked six days a week as a nurse to care for her and her younger brother. Sotomayor graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University and attended Yale Law School, where she was editor of the Yale Law Journal. She worked at nearly every level of the judicial system over a three-decade career before being tapped by Obama. Her supporters touted her as someone with bipartisan favor and historic appeal. President George H.W. Bush named her a district judge in 1992. She had served as a judge on the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals since President Bill Clinton appointed her in 1998. Prior to her judicial appointments, Sotomayor was a partner at a private law firm and spent time as an assistant district attorney prosecuting violent crimes.","NEW: Sonia Sotomayor's mother, Celina, holds Bible for ceremony .

"(CNN)  -- A three-day manhunt ended when officials caught a murder suspect who escaped from a southeastern Louisiana jail with three other inmates, a police news release said. Timothy Murray, 29, who is charged with murder, has been recaptured, authorities in Louisiana say. Police found Timothy Murray at about 1 a.m. Sunday in a wooded stretch in the Folsom area of St. Tammany Parish, the release said. Police returned Murray to the St. Tammany Parish Jail in Covington, north of New Orleans, Louisiana. Murray, 29, is charged with murder, said Capt. George Bonnett of the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office. Three other escapees were rearrested Friday, Bonnett said. Thursday night's escape by Murray and the three others prompted a massive search using dogs, three helicopters and more than 100 officers, Bonnett said. Bonnett said he could not speak to how long it took to plan the escape, but that ""it clearly was a situation where there appeared to be a great amount of planning and forethought."" The inmates captured Friday were Gary Slaydon, 27; Eric Buras, 30; and Jason Gainey, 27. Slaydon is charged with attempted murder, and Buras is a murder suspect. Gainey has been convicted of murder. They were found in a wooded area about a mile from the jail, Bonnett said. The men escaped about 9 p.m. Thursday, Bonnett said, and the escape was not discovered until a resident and Covington police reported seeing what appeared to be inmates in jail uniforms walking down a street. About the time those calls came in, jailers were doing a routine head count and found the four men missing, Bonnett said.","Escaped inmate captured in Louisiana after three-day manhunt, police say .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Monday he did not call for a ban on Facebook during the country's presidential election. President Ahmadinejad's challengers are using new technology to spread their message. ""I should make an inquiry and ask about this,"" he said when asked about reports that his government blocked access to the online social networking site. He added, ""I believe in maximum freedom of expression."" The hardline Iranian president made the comment in response to a question from CNN at a news conference. Asked whether he would order that access to Facebook be reinstated, Ahmadinejad responded that he would ""see if there is a complaint"" that may be presented to the judiciary. The semi-official Iranian Labor News Agency reported over the weekend that the Iranian government had blocked Facebook amid political jockeying for the June 12 presidential election. Reformist candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi -- a former prime minister considered a threat to Ahmadinejad -- has created a Facebook page for his campaign and has more than 5,000 supporters on the site. Those attempting to visit Facebook were receiving a message in Farsi saying, ""Access to this site is not possible,"" according to CNN personnel in Tehran. The news agency reported the Masadiq Committee, made up of representatives from Iran's intelligence ministry, judiciary and others, had ordered the action. After a few hours, the block was lifted, but then reinstated later, the agency said. No reason was given. ""We are disappointed to learn of reports that users in Iran may not have access to Facebook, especially at a time when voters are turning to the Internet as a source of information about election candidates and their positions,"" a Facebook spokesperson said in a written statement. ""We are investigating these reports. ""We believe that people around the world should be able to use Facebook to communicate and share information with their friends, family and co-workers. It is always a shame when a countries' cultural and political concerns lead to limits being placed on the opportunity for sharing and expression that the Internet provides."" Ahmadinejad's challengers are increasingly turning to new technology to spread their message, according to a May 13 article in the Financial Times newspaper. Iran's population -- estimated at more than 66 million by July 2009, according to the CIA World Factbook -- has a median age of 27. The Financial Times, which put the country's population at 70 million, said 47 million Iranians have cell phones and 21 million have Internet access. ""We are using new technologies because they have the capacity to be multiplied by people themselves who can forward Bluetooth, e-mails and text messages and invite more supporters on Facebook,"" Behzad Mortazavi, head of Mousavi's campaign committee, told the Financial Times. At a Mousavi rally at a stadium Saturday, the Facebook blockage was a topic of conversation among reporters. Many said they had accessed Facebook on Friday night and believe the site was blocked Saturday morning. CNN's Reza Sayah and Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","Mahmoud Ahmadinejad says he did not call for a ban on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- The backdrop to countless movies and television shows, Los Angeles has been reproduced on film more times than any other city on the planet. The L.A. metropolis spreads over nearly 500 square miles. But just like the movie sets that went up in flames last year at Universal Studios, the Tinseltown glamour is often no more than a flimsy facade. Behind the myth of Hollywood lies a swirling melting pot of a place where nearly half of people speak Spanish and where, for every rising star, there's at least a hundred wannabes waiting tables or entertaining tourists on Venice Beach. At once a Lalaland filled with dreamers, Los Angeles has also been scene to some of the worst race riots in American history: a paradoxical place that spawned both Charlie Chaplin and Gangsta Rap. These days, aside from the smog -- an ever present in a city plagued with so many cars and so little rainfall -- the atmosphere is less toxic than two decades ago when the city was awash with crack cocaine and guns.  Watch Wolfgang Puck take CNN on a tour of L.A. Â» . Schemes to gentrify the downtown and other areas, such as the construction of the Hollywood and Highland complex that includes the Kodak Theater -- home to the Oscars since 2002 -- have gone some way to revitalizing the inner city. In any case, in a city with an estimated population of 3.8 million sprawling over a metropolis nearly 500 square miles in size, it's easy to avoid the sharper edges if you want to. Not that that's so surprising. After all, where better to detune from reality than in a town whose success is entirely founded on our appetite for escapism. And from its world class art galleries to the unashamed schmaltz of Disneyland and the Hollywood Walk of Fame, it offers escapism for all tastes. The Los Angeles story started in the late nineteenth century when Midwesterners attracted by the promise of a warm, dry climate followed the railroad west. The boom times risked coming to a premature halt at the turn of the century due to water shortages, but the smart engineering and dark maneuverings of the city water department (maneuverings that helped inspire the classic film noir, Chinatown) resulted in the construction of water aqueducts that ensured the city's continued growth. See pictures of Wolfgang Puck's Los Angeles . In the end though, light was the natural resource that mattered most. From the 1920s onwards, the motion picture industry grew into a worldwide phenomenon thanks to the abundance of clear, blue skies to help light the movie moguls sets. By the time the Golden Age of Hollywood came to an end, the boom town had morphed into a sprawling urban center and the lure of the limelight had earned the city the tag it retains to this day, that of ""entertainment capital of the world."" In the early nineties, the story lost its luster somewhat when years of marginalization suffered by African Americans found a rallying point in the Rodney King beating. Despite a video that appeared to show police violently attacking King, the accused officers were acquitted. The verdict led to rioting in which 53 people died and large areas went up in flames. The city is certainly no angel, it's true. Even so, whether it's tattooed bodybuilders rollerblading Santa Monica Boulevard, a Marilyn Monroe look alike blowing kisses outside Grauman's Chinese Theater or a blood red sunset dropping into the Pacific, Los Angeles is a place with a rare ability to beguile and bemuse in equal measure.","Los Angeles is known as ""the entertainment capital of the world""

"PARIS, France (CNN)  -- The French National Assembly announced Tuesday the creation of an inquiry into whether women in France should be allowed to wear the burka, one day after President Nicolas Sarkozy controversially told lawmakers that the traditional Muslim garment was ""not welcome"" in France. A woman wears traditionnal Muslim dress n Venissieux, near Lyon. A cross-party panel of 32 lawmakers will investigate whether the traditional Muslim garment poses a threat to the secular nature of the French constitution. They are due to report back with their recommendations in six months. Last week 57 lawmakers -- led by communist legislator Andre Gerin -- signed a petition calling for a study into the feasibility of legislation to ban the burka in public places. On Monday Sarkozy declared in a keynote parliamentary address that the burka, which covers women from head to toe, is ""not welcome"" in France.  Watch why burkas are such a controversial issue in France Â» . ""The problem of the burka is not a religious problem. This is an issue of a woman's freedom and dignity. This is not a religious symbol. It is a sign of subservience; it is a sign of lowering. I want to say solemnly, the burka is not welcome in France,"" Sarkozy told lawmakers. The right of Muslim women to cover themselves is fiercely debated in France, which has a large Muslim minority but also a staunchly secular constitution. Should Muslim women in France be banned from wearing the burka? Sound Off below . In 2004, the French parliament passed legislation banning Muslim girls from wearing headscarves in state schools, prompting widespread Muslim protests. The law also banned other conspicuous religious symbols including Sikh turbans, large Christian crucifixes and Jewish skull caps. Last year, France's top court denied a Moroccan woman's naturalization request on the grounds that she wore a burka. Some lawmakers have called for burkas to be banned completely, claiming they are degrading to women. They also include housing minister Fadela Amara, a Muslim-born women's rights campaigner, who has called the garment ""a kind of tomb for women."" ""We cannot accept in our country women trapped behind a fence, cut off from social life, deprived of any identity. This is not the idea that we have of a woman's dignity,"" Sarkozy said Monday. But French Muslim leaders say that only a small minority of women wear the full veil and had previously criticized calls for the issue to be the subject of a parliamentary inquiry. ""To raise the subject like this, via a parliamentary committee, is a way of stigmatizing Islam and the Muslims of France,"" Mohammed Moussaoui, the head of the French Council for the Muslim Religion, told AFP last week. ""We are shocked by the idea parliament should be put to work on such a marginal issue."" According to CIA estimates, between 5 and 10 percent of France's 64 million population are Muslim. The country does not collect its own statistics on religion in accordance with laws enshrining France's status as a secular state. France is not the only European Union country to have considered banning the burka. Dutch lawmakers voted in favor of a ban in 2005, although the government of the time was defeated in elections before it could pass legislation to outlaw the garment.","French lawmakers to consider whether burka threatens French secularism .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The sponsor of a proposal to rein in aggressive celebrity photographers is meeting resistance from Los Angeles' top cop, who says the law is not needed when celebrities just behave. Photographers swarm a car carrying Britney Spears after a Los Angeles court appearance in October 2007. City Councilman Dennis Zine wants to require photographers to stay a safe distance from celebrities. His proposed ordinance is nicknamed the ""Britney Law"" for the hordes of paparazzi that swarm around pop star Britney Spears, sometimes costing the city thousands of dollars for escorts and other enforcement. ""They act like a pack of wolves stalking their prey, creating havoc in the streets, and are nuisances to innocent bystanders,"" Zine said at a task force hearing he convened Thursday.  Watch how paparazzi spy on Hollywood stars Â» . The proposal gained exposure last month when officials from around Southern California asked former independent counsel Kenneth Starr -- whose investigation of former President Clinton spawned its own share of tabloid headlines -- to help craft a law that would protect celebrities without infringing on freedom of the press.  iReport.com: Share your celeb stories and photos . Critics of the plan include Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton, who argues that it would be difficult to enforce. He also says existing laws can keep unruly packs of photographers in check. The chief said the city's tabloid darlings could help by providing photographers less to work with. ""If celebrities behave themselves, that solves about 90 percent of the problem,"" Bratton said. ""Britney, the last couple of days, has started wearing clothes again. The paparazzi are leaving town because she's not as interesting when she's not running around without her underwear on."" He said actress Lindsay Lohan ""evidently found a new love life, so she's probably in New York hanging out"" and that ""God knows"" where billionaire heiress Paris Hilton had been. ""She's thankfully disappeared from the scene,"" Bratton said. At the hearing, members of the paparazzi also said the law would be impossible to enforce. ""Unless every celebrity has a chaperone of a police officer with a 6-foot tape measure, how are you going to enforce it?"" said photographer Nick Stern. Those attending included musician John Mayer, actor Eric Roberts, sheriff's officials, representatives of the Screen Actors Guild and officials from West Hollywood, Beverly Hills and Malibu.

"(CNN) -- We hear that a lot of young people don't care or worry about the economy and finances. But take it from a 23-year-old Wall Street Journal reporter: They do and should care. Kelly Evans, 23, is an economics reporter for The Wall Street Journal. Kelly Evans started as an economics reporter at the paper as the economy started getting bad a year and a half ago. She has since seen the resilience of the people in her generation as they adapt to a changing job market. CNN's Nicole Lapin talked to Evans about what young people should be doing to deal with the tough times. The following is an edited transcript of the interview: . Nicole Lapin: What do you tell young people to make economic news relevant to them?  Watch the entire interview with Kelly Evans Â» . Kelly Evans: We really, really do try to explain to people, past some of the language and the jargon, to say that economics is really about what's happening: your job, your income, demographics, poverty rates, and what it looks like across the country. There are some terms that may seem unfamiliar, but I think if you sit down and read through our coverage, you'll see that a lot of it makes sense. I feel very proud of the fact that over the last year, year and a half, a lot of the articles that I've written and a lot of the articles that we've written as an economics team have done a lot to point out the risks out there so that this didn't just come out of nowhere. Lapin: So what are some of the things that young people should really focus on? Is it a 401(k)? Is it savings? Is it a combination of the two, perhaps? Evans: Well, I think for most young people, the big thing right now is a career or a job path. Whether you're in high school or you're in college, you're thinking, ""What am I going to do when I get out? Do I want to be a doctor, or a lawyer?"" I think less people want to be in banking than did a few years ago, and so I'm curious as a reporter what is perceived to be the golden ticket nowadays. Certainly health care, education are some of the more reliable places to go right now. So what I would say mostly is make sure you're in a good financial position. Do whatever you can for yourself. But really make sure you're investing in your education or skills, maybe the language skills in particular, that will be really important down the road. I think that ends up paying off in human capital. It's really important. Lapin: What kind of tips do you give to youngsters who are about to get out of school? Evans: I would encourage people who are looking at colleges to ignore the brand name and really go with what is going to be the best value to you.","Kelly Evans is an economics reporter for The Wall Street Journal .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The crown of the Statue of Liberty will reopen to tourists on July 4. The Statue of Liberty welcomes visitors, immigrants, and returning Americans. The crown was closed after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, for safety and security reasons. The National Park Service closed the attraction amid worries that it would be difficult for visitors to evacuate quickly in the event of an emergency. Visitors must climb a narrow 168-step double-helix spiral staircase to get to the crown. Since the closing, tourists have been able to visit other parts of the statue. iReport.com: Show us your best Statue of Liberty shots . The federal government planned to give ""America a special gift"" by re-opening the crown, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in May. ""We are once again inviting the public to celebrate our great nation and the hope and opportunity it symbolizes by climbing to Lady Liberty's crown for a unique view of New York Harbor, where the forebears of millions of American families first saw the world,"" he said in a statement. Access to the crown will be limited to 10 people at a time, guided by a National Park Service ranger. ""We cannot eliminate all the risk of climbing to the crown, but we are taking steps to make it safer,"" Salazar said. The measures include raising the handrails on the spiral staircase and stationing rangers throughout the Statue to help visitors. The Statue of Liberty will be open for the next two years, then closed again for ""work on a long-term solution that will improve safety and security permanently,"" according to the U.S. Department of the Interior. A gift from France to the United States, the Statue of Liberty was dedicated in 1886, designated as a National Monument in 1924 and restored for its centennial on July 4, 1986.

"(CNN) -- A drunk passenger tried to hijack a Turkish Airlines flight to Russia on Wednesday before he was brought under control, the head of Turkey's civil aviation authority said. The Turkish Airlines passenger jet was en route from Turkey to Russia when the incident took place. The plane landed safely and on time Wednesday afternoon in St. Petersburg. Russian authorities promptly arrested a ""slightly intoxicated"" passenger from Uzbekistan, Russia's Interfax News Agency reported, citing a national police spokesman. The suspect, in his early 50s, was arrested on suspicion of trying to hijack the plane, Interfax reported. Turkish media initially reported that the plane had been hijacked. When asked about those reports, a Turkish Airlines spokesman said the flight experienced an ""urgent situation"" as it headed to St. Petersburg, without offering further details. Interfax said the flight was carrying 164 Russian nationals. There have been several attempts to hijack Turkish airlines in recent years. In August 2007, two men hijacked an Istanbul-bound Atlasjet Airlines flight with 136 passengers and crew on board from Cyprus, claiming to have a bomb on board the flight. They forced the crew to make an emergency landing in Antalya. Both hijackers eventually surrendered to Turkish authorities. In April 2007, Turkish authorities detained a man they believed tried to hijack a Turkish airliner, possibly to Iran. The suspect, Mehmed Goksin Gol, was not armed and all 178 passengers and crew aboard the Pegasus Airlines flight were unharmed. The flight was heading from southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir to Istanbul, but landed at Ankara's airport, where the suspect was detained. In October 2006, a Turkish man hijacked a Turkish jetliner with 113 people aboard en route from the Albanian capital Tirana for Istanbul. He forced it to fly to a military airfield in Brindisi, Italy, where the passengers and crew were released unharmed.

"Editor's note: Robert J. Shiller is a professor of economics at Yale University. This op-ed is based on his book with George Akerlof, ""Animal Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism."" Akerlof is a 2001 Nobel laureate in economics and professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley. Robert Shiller says basic psychogical factors led to excesses which have devastated the economy. (CNN) -- President Obama's National Economic Council head Lawrence Summers noted in his speech March 13 that the economic crisis has led to an ""excess of fear"" that must be reversed. To understand the role fear plays in the current crisis, we must understand the role of human psychology. John Maynard Keynes thought psychology was the major cause of economic booms as well as busts, though this aspect of his work is now largely forgotten. He said people's economic decisions, in both good times and bad times, are largely, ultimately, if indirectly, driven by animal spirits, primitive psychological tendencies. In a recently published book, George Akerlof and I identified three animal spirits that played critical roles in the current economic meltdown. They are confidence, bad faith and storytelling. Let's first consider confidence and its dictionary meaning. Confidence means complete and secure trust. But trust goes beyond the rational use of information that is usually considered in economic theory. Trust is largely an emotion. Indeed we saw the role of vivid emotions in the stock and housing market booms that brought on our current problems. Trust is a state of mind that is the opposite of vigilance. People were purchasing and selling complex financial instruments without looking carefully at them. This trust is broken. The second animal spirit that came into play was bad faith. With so many trusting people, an uglier side of human nature became prominent. The temptation for smart promoters was overwhelming. Questionable practices boomed, and regulators failed to step in, because of the view, taken from economists, that private markets would be self-policing. Investors would only put their money at increased risk if they were duly compensated by higher expected returns. Thus, there was little worry about laxity of regulation in securities and real estate markets. But, this self-policing view did not consider that these investors might be overconfident. There is a myth that capitalism produces what people really want, as long as firms can make a profit. But, instead, more generally, it produces what people think they want, as long as firms can make a profit. True, unregulated capitalism will produce good medicines that cure our ills. But unregulated capitalism will also produce snake oil that people think they want, but does not cure our ills. (To guard against the production of such things, the federal government established the Food and Drug Administration in 1906.) The problem of snake oil has special relevance for financial assets, which are only pieces of paper. Most investors can surmise their value only from what others, such as accountants and rating agencies, tell them. These accounting and rating agencies also have their own incentives. And those incentives have not been fully aligned with the public's interest. And so when people are overconfident, financial markets produce assets that take advantage of that overconfidence. If unprotected by effective regulation, people will be sold snake oil assets. Just recently an industry arose, in Wall Street and beyond, to produce them. A third animal spirit bolstered the previous two. People act and think and live according to stories, especially human interest stories, not usually abstract calculation. That goes for their personal decisions. But there is also always a story, usually with some grain of truth and human interest, about the economy. These stories are often overly exuberant, on the one side, or overly pessimistic on the other. Ten years ago we had the story of the dot-com millionaires. Most recently we believed alchemists of financial engineering were packaging risky financial assets to make them safe. People were overconfident. And markets took advantage of their beliefs to sell them what later proved to be snake oil assets. These three animal spirits then explain how factors in human psychology play a key role in why the economy fluctuates as much as it does. The confidence comes and goes. The stories come and go. The snake oil comes and goes. This explanation for economic fluctuations has implications for the role of government. The first role of government is, before the fact -- as with the Food and Drug Administration -- to protect the public from negative consequences of their animal spirits (and to let them prevail and even to encourage the positive consequences). If, as now, the snake oil has been swallowed, it is the role of the government to restore our health. The government must aim to achieve full employment of the population by added spending to boost the economy and policies to make credit widely available. It should fulfill the full-employment goals of the Employment Act of 1946. That means that producers who produce good products at a profit should have buyers who want to buy them; workers who have trained for productive jobs should be able to get them. It also means that producers who can produce such products can get the credit to finance their production; and buyers who want to purchase these products can obtain the credit to purchase them. Why are such targets useful and necessary? History tells us. In the Great Depression, both Hoover and Roosevelt had many pragmatic schemes to put people back to work and keep credit markets from falling apart. But for lack of a correct theory of the economy, and targets corresponding to that theory, their measures fell far short. Unemployment in the United States only fell below 10 percent after the start of World War II, in 1941. Such targets are necessary for political reasons as well. Any effective plan to resolve our crisis will involve massive sticker shock. The two targets are necessary to justify and explain the tough and expensive measures that need to be taken. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Shiller.","Robert Shiller: Economic boom gave rise to schemes that relied on trust .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Sen. Mel Martinez, a Florida Republican, announced Friday that he will resign his seat as soon as a replacement can be named by the governor. Sen. Mel Martinez is the only Hispanic Republican in the U.S. Senate. ""My priorities have always been my faith, my family and my country, and, at this stage of my life and after nearly 12 years of public service in Florida and in Washington, it is time to return to Florida and my family,"" the 62-year-old said in Orlando, Florida. ""So today I am announcing my decision to step down from public office."" Martinez said he is resigning ""of my own free will. There is no impending reason; it's only my desire to move on and to get on with the rest of my life."" He added that he is in good health and that he expects the next phase of his life will take place in the private sector. ""However, I do hope that I can have a voice to speak out on issues I think are important,"" he said. Martinez added that he has no plans to run for any other public office. At a news conference at McDill Air Force Base in Florida, Gov. Charlie Crist said he will ""undertake a very thorough, comprehensive, thoughtful process"" to find a replacement for Martinez. He vowed not to appoint himself to complete Martinez's six-year term, which ends in about 17 months, and predicted that he would reach a decision before the Senate returns from recess September 8. Crist, a Republican, had announced in May that he would not seek a second term as governor and instead would run for Martinez's seat in the 2010 election. Martinez was elected in 2004. He announced in December his intention to retire at the end of his term. Martinez is the only Hispanic Republican in the Senate. He joined eight other Republicans on Thursday in voting to confirm Judge Sonia Sotomayor as the first Hispanic justice to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. Democrats hold a tenuous filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, with 60 votes. Martinez is one of six Republicans who have stated they would not seek re-election in 2010. But the Florida senator is the second Republican who has decided to leave before the curtain drops on the 111th Congress next fall. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, recently announced her intention to quit the Senate three years before her term expires, in order to run for governor next year. The five other Republicans who are retiring are Missouri Sen. Kit Bond, Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback, New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg, Kentucky Sen. Jim Bunning and Ohio Sen. George Voinovich. Two Democrats will not run in 2010: Illinois Sen. Roland Burris and Delaware Sen. Ted Kaufman. Republicans must defend 19 seats next year, and Democrats must protect 18.

"(CNN) -- Ed McMahon, the longtime pitchman and Johnny Carson sidekick whose ""Heeeeeeerre's Johnny!"" became a part of the vernacular, has died. Ed McMahon had suffered several health problems in recent years. McMahon passed away peacefully shortly after midnight at the Ronald Reagan/UCLA Medical Center, his publicist, Howard Bragman, said Tuesday . McMahon, 86, was hospitalized in February with pneumonia and other medical problems. He had suffered a number of health problems in recent years, including a neck injury caused by a 2007 fall. In 2002, he sued various insurance companies and contractors over mold in his house and later collected a $7 million settlement. Though he later hosted a variety of shows -- including ""Star Search"" and ""TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes,"" McMahon's biggest fame came alongside Carson on ""The Tonight Show,"" which Carson hosted from 1962 to 1992. The two met not long after Carson began hosting the game show ""Who Do You Trust?"" in 1957. iReport.com: Share your memories of Ed McMahon . ""Johnny didn't look as if he was dying to see me,"" McMahon, who was hosting a show on a Philadelphia TV station, told People magazine in 1980 about the pair's first meeting. ""He was standing with his back to the door, staring at a couple of workmen putting letters on a theater marquee. I walked over and stood beside him. Finally the two guys finished, and Johnny asked, 'What have you been doing?' I told him. He said, 'Good to meet you, Ed,' shook my hand, and I was out of the office. The whole meeting was about as exciting as watching a traffic light change.""  Watch McMahon discuss meeting Johnny Carson Â» . Though McMahon was surprised to be offered the job as Carson's sidekick, the two soon proved to have a strong chemistry. Carson was, by nature, introverted and dry-witted; McMahon was the boisterous and outgoing second banana, content to give Carson straight lines or laugh uproariously at his jokes (a characteristic much-parodied by comedians).  Watch Comedian Joan Rivers recall McMahon Â» . Carson made cracks about McMahon's weight, his drinking and the men's trouble with divorce. McMahon was married three times; Carson, who died in 2005, had four wives. McMahon was also the show's designated pitchman, a talent he honed to perfection during ""Tonight's"" 30-year run with Carson, even if sometimes the in-show commercial spots fell flat. For one of the show's regular sponsors, Alpo dog food, McMahon usually extolled the virtues of the product while a dog eagerly gobbled down a bowl. But one day the show's regular dog wasn't available, and the substitute pooch wasn't very hungry. McMahon recalled the incident in his 1998 memoir, ""For Laughing Out Loud."" ""Then I saw Johnny come into my little commercial area. He got down on his hands and knees and came over to me. ... I started to pet Johnny. Nice boss, I was thinking as I pet him on the head, nice boss. By this point the audience was hysterical. ... I just kept going. I was going to get my commercial done. "" 'The next time you're looking at the canned dog food ...' -- he rubbed his cheek against my leg --  ... reach for the can that contains real beef.' Johnny got up on his knees and started begging for more. I started petting him again ... and then he licked my hand."" McMahon also promoted Budweiser, American Family Insurance and -- during the most recent Super Bowl -- Cash4Gold.com. Entertainment Weekly named him No. 1 on its list of TV's greatest sidekicks. Edward Leo Peter McMahon Jr. was born in Detroit, Michigan, on March 6, 1923. His father was a promoter, and McMahon remembered moving a lot during his childhood. ""I changed towns more often than a pickpocket,"" McMahon told People. He later joined the Marines and served in World War II and Korea. Though McMahon was well-rewarded by NBC -- the 1980 People article listed his salary between $600,000 and $1 million -- his divorces and some poor investments took their toll. In June 2008, The Wall Street Journal reported that McMahon was $644,000 in arrears on a $4.8 million loan for a home in Beverly Hills, California, and his lender had filed a notice of default. McMahon and his wife, Pamela, told CNN's Larry King that McMahon had gotten caught in a spate of financial problems. ""If you spend more money than you make, you know what happens. And it can happen. You know, a couple of divorces thrown in, a few things like that,"" said McMahon, who added that he hadn't worked much since the neck injury. McMahon later struck a deal that allowed him to stay in the house. He is survived by his wife, Pamela, and five children. A sixth child, McMahon's son Michael, died in 1995.","McMahon's biggest fame came alongside Johnny Carson on ""The Tonight Show""

"(CNN) -- Norman Ollestad remembers the tree limb. The book's jacket features a picture of a 1-year-old Norman clinging to his father's back on a surfboard. He was 11 years old, riding in a Cessna in a blizzard through California's San Gabriel Mountains in 1979, on his way to pick up a trophy he won in a skiing competition. ""The gray clouds were just pressing against the windows; it didn't even seem like we were moving,"" he recalls. ""Then, there's a limb reaching out of that fog and disappearing. Then another one and another one. ""Then realizing we were in the trees."" The plane crash that followed killed his father and the pilot and badly wounded his father's girlfriend, who with young Norman was tossed violently onto the top of an 8,600-foot mountain in the freezing, February chill. ""I felt three thuds. The third one must have knocked me cold,"" says Ollestad, now 41. ""I remember feeling those thuds in my spine -- a clear memory of that. Then I woke up who knows how long after."" The ensuing nine-hour, life-or-death descent -- in the end, he was the only survivor -- is the topic of ""Crazy for the Storm: A Memoir of Survival.""  Watch the press conference that followed his survival Â» . But the book is about more than a plane crash, namely his relationship with an adrenaline-junkie father who basked in the wild life of Malibu in the 1970s and relentlessly pushed his ""Boy Wonder"" to excel from the ski slopes of northern California to the crashing surf off the Mexican coast. ""It's actually 100 percent about my relationship with my father,"" Ollestad said. ""That relationship was present on the mountain with me, even though he was dead."" Released this month, the book already has been picked up by Warner Bros. [a sister company of CNN] for a feature film and has earned critical acclaim, including comparisons to John Krakauer's 1997 nonfiction best-seller ""Into Thin Air."" ""An engrossing story of adventure, survival and psychological exploration,"" wrote the journal Kirkus Reviews. In the book, Ollestad cuts back and forth between the crash and journey down the mountain and the years leading up to that moment. Included are memories of life in Malibu, where he grew up the son of divorced parents in a cottage on the beach. There are surfers and skate rats, musicians and nudists and memories of smoking weed and spying on his neighbors' most intimate moments. But mostly there's his father, Norman Ollestad Sr., an athlete, actor, lawyer, musician and former FBI agent. From the age of 3, Norman was groomed for competitive ""extreme sports"" by his father and pushed to be the best. The book's jacket features a picture of a 1-year-old Norman clinging to his father's back as he steers a surfboard atop the waves of California's Topanga State Beach. He acknowledges that many times, when his father was cooking up a new adventure for the two of them, he would rather have been ""riding my bike or eating chocolate cake."" ""[At first] a lot of people are, 'Wow .. I had a lot of trouble with some of the stuff your dad was doing,' "" says Ollestad, who studied creative writing at UCLA and attended UCLA's film school. ""But then it turned out that a lot of that stuff was really beautiful."" And he believes it saved his life. The skiing made him aware of how steep the mountain's slope was and what it would take to get down it without falling. The skiing and surfing gave him control of his body and awareness of the exact movements required to work his way out of the descent's most treacherous spots. ""Some of it was sort of eerily, specifically perfect for the situation,"" he says. ""Forty-five degree pitch, blizzard with ice, well, I've been here for eight years doing this. It was familiar to me."" The book has had another, unexpected result for Ollestad, who now lives in Venice, California. He says he's been shocked at the e-mail from readers. ""Nobody's even written about the plane crash,"" he says. ""[They say] 'it reminds me of some of the things I did with my dad or some of the things I didn't get to do.' ""In every e-mail, whether it's a woman or a man, they talk about ...their relationship with their father or mother. It touches something in there where they want to talk about it."" Now, for Ollestad, the story has followed him all the way around. He's the father of an 8-year-old, Noah, and seeks to walk the line between responsible parenting and teaching his child the lessons he says saved his life. ""Those were different times,"" he tells the boy in the book's epilogue. ""My dad made me do lots of things that I'd get arrested for making you do.""","Norman Ollestad was 11 years old when the plane he was in crashed .

"SRINAGAR, Indian-administered Kashmir (CNN) -- The chief minister of Indian-administered Kashmir tendered his resignation Tuesday after he was accused of being involved in a 2006 sex scandal, his adviser said. Omar Abdullah denies any link to a prostitution ring, saying he has stepped down to clear his name. Omar Abdullah, 38, delivered his resignation to the state governor after opposition member Muzaffar Hussain Beigh accused Omar of a connection to the prostitution scandal during a session of the state legislative assembly. Muzaffar served as the deputy chief minister in the previous government, when several top pro-India officials were arrested on charges they misused their authority to force girls and women into a prostitution ring in Kashmir. Omar denied being involved in the scandal, but said he could not ""continue in the office following the allegation"" and would not serve again until he is cleared of the charges. ""This is not an ordinary allegation, but a highly serious one. I cannot continue in office until I am cleared,"" Omar said in the state assembly. He then drove to Raj Bhawan, the official residence of New Delhi-appointed governor N. N. Vohra, to deliver his resignation, according to Devender Rana, Omar's political adviser. The governor is consulting constitutional and legal experts before deciding on the resignation. The chief minister refused to talk to journalists outside the governor's residence. The Times of India newspaper Tuesday quoted highly placed sources in India's Central Bureau of Investigation as saying that Omar's name never came up in the prostitution probe. Omar came into office in January following elections in late 2008 that saw the highest voter turnout in the region in nearly 20 years, since the eruption of a secessionist insurgency. Voters went to the polls in large numbers, despite a separatist call for a boycott of the voting. Most recently, the chief minister has been working to defuse tensions that are still running high following the arrest of four police officers in the probe of the alleged rape and murder of two young Muslim women in May. Two people have died and many have been injured in more than 300 violent clashes between Muslim protesters and Indian security forces stemming from the case. The arrests included the former police chief of south Kashmir's Shopian district and three of his subordinates, who are accused of ""destruction of evidence"" and ""dereliction of duty"" in connection with the deaths, which occurred in the town of Shopian. Kashmir has been in the throes of a bloody secessionist campaign for nearly two decades in which, according to official figures, 43,000 people have been killed. Various rights groups and non-governmental organizations here, however, dispute the official statistics -- claiming that the number killed during the last two decades is twice the official figure.","Chief minister of Indian-administered Kashmir tenders his resignation .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Investigators have raised the wreckage of the helicopter involved in Saturday's deadly mid-air collision over the Hudson River, but they were still looking for the small plane involved in the crash, authorities said Sunday. Divers unload a body from their raft onto a police boat Sunday. Nine people are believed dead in the crash. New York police said they believed side-scan sonar pointed them to the wreckage of the Piper Saratoga PA-32 just north of where the helicopter went down, but Deborah Hersman, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said swift current and low visibility were hindering divers. The search stopped as a storm approached Sunday evening and will resume Monday morning, police said. Nine people, including five Italian tourists, were aboard the two aircraft when they collided over the river shortly before noon Saturday. Seven bodies had been pulled out of the river by Sunday afternoon, Hersman said. Authorities believe none of the nine people aboard the two aircraft survived the crash. Neither aircraft was required to carry electronic ""black boxes"" that record cockpit voices and flight data on larger planes, but electronic navigational devices on board might retain some information that could help the probe, Hersman said. Investigators are trying to establish the facts of the crash but won't determine the probable cause for some time, Hersman said.  See where the collision occurred Â» . ""We are looking at everything. Nothing has been ruled out at this point in time,"" she said. Most of the Eurocopter AS350 had been lifted out of the Hudson on Sunday and taken to a pier in Hoboken, New Jersey, across the river from Manhattan, for examination, Hersman said. The helicopter was taking the five Italians on a 12-minute sightseeing tour around New York and had taken off from a heliport in midtown Manhattan shortly before the crash, she said.  Watch crews search for victims Â» . New York police identified the pilot of the helicopter as Jeremy Clark, 32. He had worked for the operator, Liberty Helicopter Sightseeing Tours, for about a year and a half and had 2,700 helicopter flight hours, Hersman said. iReport.com: Were you there? Send images . His passengers were Michele Norelli, 51; Fabio Gallazzi, 49; Filippo Norelli, 16; Giacomo Gallazzi, 15; and Tiziana Pedroni, 44, all of Bologna, Italy. The plane took off from a Philadelphia-area airfield Saturday morning, landed at New Jersey's Teterboro Airport and was bound for Ocean City, New Jersey, with three people aboard -- the owner and pilot, Steven Altman, 60, of Ambler, Pennsylvania; his brother, Daniel Altman, 49, of Dresher, Pennsylvania; and Daniel Altman's son Douglas, 16. Controllers lost contact with the plane at 11:53 a.m., when it was at an altitude of about 1,100 feet, Hersman said.  View images from the scene Â» . Hersman said the NTSB has recorded eight accidents and one ""incident"" involving Liberty, but Saturday's crash was the first to involve fatalities. Previous accidents included a 2007 case in which a helicopter crash-landed in the Hudson from a height of 500 feet, but without injuring passengers; a 2008 incident in which one helicopter taking off clipped another on the ground; a 2008 incident in which a pilot caused ""substantial damage"" to a helicopter while landing during an instructional session. In 2001, a Liberty pilot made an ""improper decision"" to continue flying in poor weather at night, causing the helicopter to hit trees, according to the NTSB. Marcia Horowitz, a spokeswoman for the tour operator, said Liberty executives ""are cooperating fully"" with investigators. ""Right now, the company is focusing its efforts on cooperating with the NTSB and giving as much information as it can,"" Horowitz said. ""At this time, their priority is to help with the family of their pilot, and of course the families that were involved in the accident."" Investigators will focus on radio communications along the congested air corridor at the time of the crash and examine any pictures or video contributed by the public, Hersman told CNN earlier. Witness accounts and still photographs already provided ""good information"" to investigators, she said. A witness told investigators he saw the airplane approach the helicopter from behind, and the plane's right wing make ""contact with the helicopter,"" Hersman said. The witness, another Liberty pilot who was refueling at a nearby heliport, said he tried to warn the helicopter pilot but got no response. Other witnesses reported seeing debris flying from the helicopter as it slammed into the water. Arnold Stevens, who saw the collision from the W Hotel in Hoboken, said the helicopter ""dropped like a rock,"" while one of the plane's wings was sheared off and it began ""corkscrewing"" into the water, he said. The busy airspace surrounding Manhattan has been the site of several recent aeronautical accidents. Earlier this year, a US Airways plane with 155 people on board ditched into the Hudson after apparently striking birds upon takeoff from New York's LaGuardia Airport, officials said. Capt. Chesley B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger's landing, which resulted in no deaths or serious injuries, was captured on closed circuit television. In 2006, Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle, 34, and his flight instructor were killed when the ballplayer's plane crashed into a high-rise apartment building near the East River, city officials said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Blind women are being trained to use their sensitive touch to help detect breast cancer earlier and more precisely than doctors. The blind assistants use tape strips with braille coordinates to accurately locate cancerous lumps . The program, called ""Discovering Hands,"" is the brainchild of German gynecologist Dr. Frank Hoffmann. Two years ago, he created Braille strips as a system of orientation, allowing the blind to carry out breast examinations. Using these strips blind women are trained to become Medical Tactile Examiners (MTUs) because they are more able to detect smaller lumps than sighted doctors. Hoffman argues that because of their disability, the blind can possess a more acutely developed sense of touch, which has proved to be a valuable asset in breast examinations. Once the strips are placed along specific areas of the breast, they are then used to report a precise location to the doctor as the MTU reads their Braille coordinates. ""We are turning a disability into a gift,""  Dr. Hoffmann told CNN. ""It's like the game Battleship,"" he added. ""You have the exact location."" A study at the Essen University's women's clinic, Germany, concluded that MTUs found more and smaller tumors than doctors in 450 cases. The identification of smaller lumps allows earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment. Another advantage of having MTUs is that they are able to dedicate more time to examining a patient. Dr. Hoffman said he had previously been able to spend only a few minutes on each examination due to his other commitments, whereas MTUs can commit half an hour. Training takes place at the BFW occupational school in DÃ¼ren, west Germany, a center for those who are no longer able to continue their profession because of visual impairment or blindness. So far, ten blind women have qualified as MTUs. One of the women, Marie-Luise Voll, 57, told CNN: "" The work brings me a lot of joy."" Voll had previously practiced as a nurse before losing her sight in 2007, but used the experience when training at DÃ¼ren for her new role. The highly personal nature of the procedure means that only women will be trained. The MTUs report to the doctor - for whom they act as an assistant not a replacement - who then uses this information as part of their ultimate diagnosis. If an abnormality is located the doctor will decide how to proceed, with ultrasounds and mammography being the most frequent course of action. The testing phase of the project between 2006 and 2008 has now been completed in Germany. The hope is that twenty trained MTUs will qualify every year after 2010. The program has been acclaimed as a success by both patients and practitioners in Germany. Health services in Europe including Ireland, France, Denmark and Austria have also registered interest in starting an equivalent of their own, Hoffman said.","Blind women being trained to use their sensitive touch to detect breast cancer lumps .

"(CNN) -- Golf was considered a sport of the capitalist elite and banned in Eastern Europe under the rule of communist regimes -- but in the 20 years since the Berlin Wall has fallen there has been a renaissance of the game in the region. Gary Player has overseen the development of two courses on the Black Sea coast in Bulgaria. With rising disposable income and an increasing interest in leisure pursuits, a growing number of courses, more television coverage and availability of EU funds, the future of the industry in Eastern Europe is bright. Bulgaria is one country where the sport is on the up. Eight years ago there were no golf courses but --to fulfil the increasing domestic demand and as a means to attract tourists to the region -- the country could be set for a  boom in golf development. Kancho Stoychev, vice president of Bulgarian Golf, believes that despite there being only 200 registered players in a country whose population is eight million there is set to be an explosion of interest in the sport. See CNN's Justin Armsden's report on the development of golf in Eastern Europe. Â» . ""It is an absurdly low figure, but now I believe that there'll be a switch because we have six nice golf courses,"" Stoychev told CNN. ""We can already see there is a high increase in interest and it'll evolve quite quickly. ""We have some advantages in Bulgaria. We have an excellent coastlines, we are a small country but very diverse, so the country is geographically and naturally perfect for golf."" The potential in Eastern Europe has also been recognized by golf legend Gary Player, whose course design company has been working on projects in the region. Having just opened a course in Poland, Player's design company is building two more in Bulgaria - BlackSeaRama which is already open, and Thracian Cliffs which is scheduled to be finished by July 2010. Player told CNN: ""You want to take golf to new areas, like Poland, you want to bring it to Bulgaria, where people never thought that they could play golf where people associated golf with just rich people. ""You can play down here along the ocean and ten minutes up the mountain you have a links course, which is the complete opposite, people who love golf will be in for a golfing treat."" The knock-on effect of the presence of a high-profile name such as Player in the region ensures it has caught the eye of influential figures within the industry. Ryan Lauder, director of marketing at TaylorMade added: ""Eastern Europe is coming along, although there is still not the number of golfers or golf courses that we have in Western Europe, looking to the future it is a great opportunity for us.""","Golf has made progress in Eastern Europe since the collapse of communism .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A Bedouin who was just a boy when a U.S. Navy pilot's plane crashed in the Iraqi desert in 1991 was the key to finding his remains more than 18 years after he was killed, the Pentagon says. Marines conduct recovery efforts at the crash site of U.S. Navy Capt. Michael Scott Speicher, shot down in 1991. The new details of the final hunt for U.S. Navy pilot Scott Speicher, who was lost over Iraq on the opening night of the Gulf War in January 1991, were released by the Pentagon Friday. Two sites were searched by U.S. troops who dug west of Baghdad, Iraq, in Anbar province, one at the plane crash site and another 2 kilometers away. The remains of Capt. Speicher were found at the second location. The U.S. military has long said Speicher had ejected out of his jet after it was hit by an Iraqi missile. After years of searching, it was just last month that the military got the crucial information that led them to the burial site. A Bedouin who was just 11 years old at the time of the crash came forward and connected the military with other locals who had knowledge of generally where the crash and burial locations were. The tipster did not know exactly where Speicher was buried but he knew others who had the knowledge, the military statement explained. ""He willingly provided his information during general discussion with MNF-W [Multi-National Force-West]personnel and stated he was unaware of the U.S. government's interest in this case until queried by U.S. investigators in July 2009,"" according to the statement. Bedouin are desert-dwelling nomadic Arabs. One hundred and fifty U.S. military troops were dispatched to dig for the remains at the crash site and did not find any sign of the pilot. At the second site the troops discovered skeletal fragments, according to the statement. Dental records initially identified the bones as Speicher's and, on August 2, DNA results came back positive. Speicher's remains will be taken to Jacksonville, Florida, for burial, according to a family spokeswoman. Speicher was a lieutenant commander when shot down, but because his status remained uncertain, he received promotions during the past 18 years, reaching the rank of captain.","U.S. Navy pilot Scott Speicher lost over Iraq opening night of Gulf War in 1991 .

"(CNN) -- A Turkish television show is offering contestants what it claims is the ""biggest prize ever"" -- the chance for atheists to convert to one of the world's major religions. The TV show offers converts to Islam the chance to visit Mecca. The show, called ""Tovbekarlar Yarisiyor,"" or ""Penitents Compete,"" features a Muslim imam, a Catholic priest, a Jewish rabbi and a Buddhist monk attempting to persuade 10 atheists of the merits of their religion, according to CNN Turk. If they succeed, the contestants are rewarded with a pilgrimage to one of their chosen faith's most sacred sites -- Mecca for Muslims, Jerusalem for converts to Judaism, a trip to Tibet for Buddhists and the chance to visit Ephesus and the Vatican for Christians. Ahmet Ozdemir, deputy director of Turkish channel Kanal T, which will air the show from September, said the program aimed to ""turn disbelievers on to God."" ""People are free to believe anything they want. Our program does not have a say,"" he said, according to Turkish newspaper Hurriyet. Contestants will be judged by a panel of eight theologians and religious experts prior to going on the show to make sure their lack of faith is genuine. But the show has been condemned by Turkish religious leaders. The head of the country's supreme council of religious affairs, Hamza Aktan, told CNN Turk that it was ""disrespectful"" to place different faiths in competition with each other and accused Kanal T of using religion to boost ratings. ""To do such a thing for the sake of ratings, not only with Islam but with all religions is disrespectful,"" said Aktan. ""Religion should not be the subject of this type of program."" Although Turkey has a predominantly Muslim population and culture, religion is a sensitive subject because of the country's staunchly secular constitution which outlaws most displays of faith in public life. Last year the Islamist-influenced government of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan clashed with the country's constitutional court when judges overturned the efforts of Erdogan's AK Party to lift a ban on female students wearing headscarves at public universities. Aylin Yazan at CNN Turk contributed to this story.","Turkish TV show features imam, Catholic priest, Jewish rabbi, Buddhist monk .

It's an equitable division of labor, but I wish I could sleep. 2:15 a.m. Jack (1 month) is sleeping between me and my wife because this way she can nurse while she dozes. I'm happy, but so tired. He's on his back, and there are no pillows or blankets around him, but I'm wide-awake, thinking about SIDS. He's like a little hot-water bottle. His breath is sweet and milky against my face. 10 p.m. I'm lying on a tiny crib mattress on the floor next to the crib. We're trying to get Jack (9 months) to sleep through the night. His mother and I take turns lying next to him on the floor and holding his hand through the slats. I miss my wife. 1:36 a.m. Jack (12 months) is sleeping in between us, again.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- After a six-year hiatus in which many bands have emerged, such as the Arctic Monkeys, Franz Ferdinand and Kaiser Chiefs, copying their blend of melodic, intelligent songs and cheeky blokeishness, Blur return to show them who is best. Blur frontman Damon Albarn still exudes the matey bonhomie that made him one of the best-known British pop stars of the 90s. Much has changed since the mid-1990s when the Essex boys fought Oasis in the hyped Battle of Britpop. Singer Damon Albarn has pursued successful side projects such as Gorillaz and the Chinese opera Monkey, guitarist Graham Coxon went solo after being axed acrimoniously during the troubled recording of the ""Think Tank"" album, bassist Alex James makes cheese on his farm while drummer Dave Rowntree plans to stand for the UK parliament at the next election. Happily for fans, the band's two dominant personalities in Albarn and Coxon are now reconciled and, in the year's most anticipated reunion along with The Specials' comeback gigs, Blur on Thursday played the first of two outdoor concerts in London's Hyde Park. Before a massive crowd and a setting sun, Blur kick off with their first single, a feedback-drenched ""She's So High"" before going straight into ""Girls and Boys,"" the disco-inspired anthem to hedonism that propelled them into the big time in 1994. Albarn exudes matey bonhomie, asking, ""Was that adequate?"" The crowd roars its reply in the affirmative. The good-natured banter continues throughout the concert; he pays tribute to Hyde Park's ""lakes, Speaker's Corner ... other stuff"" and more thoughtfully, reminds the crowd that a million people marched there in 2003 in an unsuccessfully effort to prevent the Iraq war. Coxon seems happy just to be back in the band, doing the job he does best. There is a poignant moment when he takes the lead vocals in ""Coffee and TV"" while Albarn watches his songwriting partner admiringly. And as with all the greatest concerts, the hits the crowd has paid to hear keep coming: ""There's No Other Way,"" a raucous and bouncy ""Country House"" and ""Parklife"" on which actor Phil Daniels takes the jokey vocals. The audience responds to all the songs perfectly, even forcing the band into an extended singalong version of ""Tender."" The only disappointment on that song is that the gospel backing singers are drowned out in the mix. As the light fades, a superb light show suits the mood of the songs perfectly. And despite this being a huge concert, there is room for more subtle songs like ""Out of Time,"" a nostalgic ""End of the Century"" and ""This is a Low."" Blur finish with ""For Tomorrow"" and ""The Universal,"" ending what, for this reporter, will be remembered as one of the most amazing concerts. What Blur fans hope for now is some new material to match the classics they are evidently so proud of.","Iconic 'Britpop' band Blur play comeback gig in London after six-year hiatus .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Five Italian tourists visiting New York from Bologna are among the nine victims believed killed Saturday in a midair collision of a sightseeing helicopter and a single-engine plane over the Hudson River, a law enforcement source said. First responders gather on a pier after a plane and helicopter collided Saturday over the Hudson River. The tourists, who apparently died with the chopper's pilot, were part of a group of 12 visiting the United States, the source said. The helicopter was operated by Liberty Helicopter Sightseeing Tours. The bodies of two adults and one child were recovered after the collision, which occurred around noon over the Hudson between New York and Hoboken, New Jersey, authorities said. The child is believed to be one of the three people on the plane, a single-engine Piper PA-32 Saratoga that took off from New Jersey's Teterboro Airport, authorities said. A source involved in the investigation identified the pilot and owner of the plane as Steven Altman, whose brother Daniel and nephew Douglas also were among the victims. The two adult bodies, discovered underwater, are believed to be two of the Italian tourists aboard the helicopter, the law enforcement source said. The Italian Foreign Ministry said consulate officials were working with New York authorities to identify the victims. Helicopter wreckage was found in about 30 feet of water, while the plane is believed to be near the midchannel point of the Hudson in deeper water, the source said. A side-scanning sonar is being used to pinpoint the plane and has identified a possible third debris field, the source said. The search is scheduled to resume Sunday morning, Debbie Hersman, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board said at a riverside news conference late Saturday. Underwater visibility of about two feet hampered Saturday's search effort, she said. All nine people in both aircrafts are thought to have been killed in the collision, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said.  See where the collision occurred Â» . ""There was an accident which we do not believe was survivable,"" said Bloomberg, noting that the search for survivors had become a recovery mission. A temporary flight restriction over the rescue area -- about three nautical miles around and 2,000 feet up -- was put in place, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman said. A witness told investigators he saw the airplane approach the helicopter from behind, Hersman said. The witness said the plane's right wing made contact with the helicopter, an American Eurocopter AS350 operated by Liberty Helicopter Sightseeing Tours, Hersman said.  View images from the scene Â» . Another Liberty pilot who was refueling at a nearby heliport told NTSB investigators that he saw the plane approach the helicopter and tried to warn the helicopter pilot, but got no response, Hersman said.

""You are supposed to be alert and see and avoid other aircraft in the vicinity."" iReport.com: Police search for debris . Witnesses reported seeing debris flying from the helicopter as it crashed. The helicopter wreckage has been found, but the search for the plane, single-engine Piper Saratoga PA-32, will continue Sunday morning, Hersman said at a riverside news conference. Witness Arnold Stevens said after the plane had a wing sheared off, it began ""corkscrewing"" into the water. The helicopter ""dropped like a rock"" after the collision, which happened about noon.  See a series of photos from the scene Â» . Radar contact was lost with a small plane this morning believed to be the aircraft in the crash, FAA spokeswoman Arlene Salac said. Ben Berman, a former investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, said if the helicopter fell straight down, it's likely there was a rotor failure. Scott Schuman was with his grandparents on the Hoboken side of the river when they heard a loud bang. ""The plane was kind of whirlybirding its way down, brown smoke coming out the back of it, and it crashed into the water. Then a few seconds later the helicopter with debris falling off of it also hit as well,"" Schuman said. ""It was a scary sight,"" he added. iReport.com: Were you there? Send images . He said some of the debris fell in Hoboken, and ""we covered our heads."" Asked if he had seen anyone in the water, Schuman replied, ""I have not seen anything, but judging by the impact when the plane and the helicopter hit, it would be very unlikely for a positive outcome."" Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer called on witnesses who filmed or photographed the incident to come forward. ""It would be extremely helpful to have that footage,"" she said.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- An 18-year-old Guatemalan man who doctors say faces almost certain death unless he receives a transplanted heart is surrounded by family as he waits, thanks to the kindness of strangers. Juan Gonzalez was earning $250 a week as a dishwasher when his heart trouble began. Juan Gonzalez, now lying in a hospital in Atlanta, hopes to learn Friday whether he will be added to the list of people eligible to receive transplants. Doctors at St. Joseph's Hospital said Gonzalez appears to be a good candidate. Without a transplant, they said, he could die in six months. The teen traveled alone to Rome, Georgia, to earn enough money to help support his family back home. The undocumented worker took a job as a dishwasher for $250 a week. That's when heart trouble stepped in. Dr. Frank Stegall, a cardiologist at Redmond Regional Medical Center in Rome, told Gonzalez he had a chronically weak heart, or dilated cardiomyopathy. The organ pumps only 20 percent of the blood a healthy heart would, Stegall said. As his heart failed, Gonzalez's plight moved the hospital staff to try to reunite him with his parents. They contacted U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey -- himself a doctor. Gingrey persuaded the State Department to expedite travel visas for Pascual and Maria Gonzalez, and Delta Air Lines provided a free ride. Last month, CNN aired a story on Juan Gonzalez. Afterward, the Larry King Cardiac Foundation -- founded by the CNN talk show host 21 years ago to pay for life-saving cardiac care for patients without insurance who don't qualify for state or federal assistance -- helped get Gonzalez transferred to St. Joseph's Hospital in Atlanta for evaluation. Many of the people who saw the story on CNN were moved to offer help. It was then that the possibility of a heart transplant became real, thanks to a large donation from one of those people. The donor has asked that details of the gift not be revealed, other than his name, Sam Shapiro. Gonzalez and his parents say they are grateful for the overwhelming support. St. Joseph's has provided housing for the parents at a nearby hotel. Although it is not clear where Gonzalez will go once the evaluation at St. Joseph is completed, staff members at Redmond in Rome, about 60 miles northwest of Atlanta, indicated they might provide a place for the parents to say. The parents' visas will run out in about two and a half months. CNN's Anna Armas contributed to this report.","Juan Gonzalez hopes to learn Friday if he will be added to heart transplant list .

"(CNN) -- NASA's Kepler space telescope has already made a discovery, and its science operations aren't even officially under way yet. The planet used in the test is a giant gas planet about the size of Jupiter that orbits a star called HAT P-7. NASA scientists who put the telescope through a 10-day test after its March 6 launch said this week that Kepler is working well. Its ability to detect minute changes in light has enabled scientists to determine that a planet orbiting a distant star has an atmosphere, shows only one side to its sun and is so hot it glows. Kepler's ability to take measurements that precise at such a great distance ""proves we can find Earth-size planets,"" William Borucki, Kepler's principal science investigator told reporters at a recent briefing. The powerful scope is looking at thousands of stars in its vision field in the Milky Way on a 3Â½-year mission to find planets the size of Earth and to determine how common these planets are. The planet used in the test, a giant gas planet about the size of Jupiter, orbits a star called HAT P-7 in just 2.2 days and is 26 times closer than Earth is to the sun, according to NASA. It is called an exoplanet because it orbits a star outside the solar system. Kepler detected the planet's atmosphere, demonstrating the telescope's capabilities and giving astronomers what NASA says is ""only a taste of things to come."" ""It learned that this planet is like 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is so hot. And it's 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit just on one side only. The other side would be closer to 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, "" said Sara Seager, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Kepler science team member. ""This particular planet showed an unusual change in brightness,"" she said. ""As the planet is orbiting the star, it goes through phases just as the moon goes through phases as seen from Earth."" ""Kepler learned something new about an old planet,"" she said. ""The new discovery was that planet is extremely hot, very, very hot. And it's very, very hot on one side, compared to the other."" Borucki compared it to ""an element in your toaster or stove.""","Kepler orbiting observatory beginning mission to find planets the size of Earth .

"(CNN) -- For actress Kyra Sedgwick, it's the public's approval that makes it worth being away from her family for six months to tape her critically acclaimed series ""The Closer."" Kyra Sedgwick and her husband, Kevin Bacon, at the 66th annual Golden Globe Awards this month. But she may be getting more approval from her peers, too. Sedgwick will walk the red carpet again Sunday night at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, where she is nominated for a fourth consecutive year for outstanding performance by a female actor in a drama series for her role as Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson. She's also won a Golden Globe for her performance, in 2007. The TNT series resumes Monday night where it left off in September with what Sedgwick called ""a fantastic five episodes."" (TNT is a unit of Time Warner, as is CNN.) ""I said to the writers, 'I really want a lot of personal stuff for Brenda,' "" Sedgwick said. ""I feel like there's some of those personal quiet moments with her alone, is something that I've been missing as an actor, and I feel like the audience has been missing, too. ""She is such a complicated, fascinating character, and watching her growth and lack of growth is something that is really interesting,"" she said. When CNN asked whether the new episodes might include a wedding for her character, Sedgwick laughed. ""That might very well happen,"" she said. ""That's pretty insightful of you. I'm just going to just say that."" A marriage for Brenda Johnson would be ""a complicated, difficult situation,"" she said, because ""she's basically married to her work."" Sedgwick's job also complicates her real-life marriage to Bacon, since the show is produced in Los Angeles and the couple lives in Connecticut with their two children. That's where the approval -- whether on the street from fans or at award shows -- has ""been a wonderful phenomenon for me,"" she said. ""On a personal level, that's really good for me, because I really miss my family when I'm working on the show six months in L.A.,"" she said. ""As much as I try to get my kids to move to L.A. and my husband, they just wouldn't have it. ""It's challenging, and I'm glad that people are watching, because otherwise it would be kind of hard to go to work,"" Sedgwick said. Sedgwick has moved into an executive producer's role on the show, which she said she expects to continue for at least two more years. ""I love being with a group where there's not a power struggle,"" she said. ""I have a lot of say, and I always have. And that feels really good.""

"(CNN) -- After deliberating for more than four hours, a jury convicted a Nevada man of 22 counts Tuesday for videotaping himself sexually assaulting a toddler, CNN affiliates report. Chester Arthur Stiles has been convicted of videtaping a sexual assault on a child. Chester Arthur Stiles, 38, faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. He was convicted of lewdness with a child, sexual assault with a minor, attempted sexual assault with a minor and other related charges. He showed no reaction as the verdict was read after more than four hours of jury deliberations, according to KLAS. Sentencing was set for May 8. The crime triggered a national manhunt and search for the girl when the tape surfaced in 2007. Jurors in Stiles' trial viewed the videotape, but the judge would not allow members sitting in the gallery to view it, and a screen was put up to block the jury box, said Michael Sommermeyer, spokesman for Clark County, Nevada, courts. Some members of the media were allowed to view the tape as well, but the judge did not want the reactions of reporters or the public to influence jurors, he said. The charges also related to another girl who Stiles was accused of sexually assaulting on videotape. The tape was given to authorities in September 2007 by a man who said he had found it in the desert five months before. On it, police found images of the small girl being sexually assaulted. After attempting unsuccessfully to find out the girl's identity, authorities turned to the media for help and released a picture of the girl, and the case drew nationwide attention. She was found in October 2007. An attorney for her mother said she was 7 years old and safe and healthy. The rape occurred before the girl's third birthday, while she was in the care of a baby-sitter her mother had hired, he said. The mother did not know the girl had been victimized. After the girl was found, authorities asked CNN and other news organizations to stop showing her picture. In an appearance on ""The Dr. Phil Show,"" the girl's mother said the girl has no recollection of the assault. Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was arrested in a traffic stop in October 2007. Police said at the time they pulled Stiles' car over because it had no license plate, and became suspicious when the driver displayed an expired California license with a photo that did not match his appearance. Stiles eventually admitted who he was and that he was being sought, authorities said. The man who turned the tape over to authorities, Darrin Tuck, faced criminal charges because of the delay in turning it over, during which authorities alleged he showed it to others. A judge gave Tuck a one-year suspended sentence and three years of probation in April after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct a public officer, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. He initially had faced a felony count of possession of child pornography.","NEW: Chester Arthur Stiles guilty of all counts in child sex video case .

"(CNN) -- Meat is murder? Well, perhaps not for much longer. Artist Banksy has satirized modern farming and meat production; could in-vitro meat be a better option? A pioneering group of scientists are working to grow real animal protein in the laboratory, which they not only claim is better for animal welfare, but actually healthier, both for people and the planet. It may sound like science fiction, but this technology to create in-vitro meat could be changing global diets within ten years. ""Cultured meat would have a lot of advantages,"" said Jason Matheny of research group New Harvest. ""We could precisely control the amount of fat in meat. We could make ground beef with an ideal fatty acid ratio -- a hamburger that prevents heart attacks instead of causing them."" But it isn't just the possibility of creating designer ground beef with the fat profile of salmon that drives Matheny's work. Meat and livestock farming is also the source of many human diseases, which he claims would be far less common when the product is raised in laboratory conditions. ""We could reduce the risks of diseases like swine flu, avian flu, 'mad cow disease', or contamination from Salmonella,"" he told CNN. ""We could produce meat in sterile conditions that are impossible in conventional animal farms and slaughterhouses. And when we grow only the meat we can eat, it's more efficient. There's no need to grow the whole animal and lose 75 to 95 percent of what we feed it."" Conventional meat production is also hard on the environment. The contribution of livestock to climate change was recently highlighted by the United Nations' report, ""Livestock's Long Shadow"", while groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth have demonstrated how soy farming for animal feed contributes to the destruction of the Amazon. In this context Matheny believes his project could significantly cut the environmental impact of meat production -- using much less water and producing far fewer greenhouse gases. ""We could reduce the environmental footprint of meat, which currently contributes more to global warming than the entire transportation sector,"" says Matheny. Preliminary results from a study by Hanna Tuomisto, at the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, University of Oxford, suggest that cultured meat would reduce the carbon emissions of meat production by more than 80 percent. Making cultured meat . In-vitro meat is made from samples of animals conventionally slaughtered. For example, ""pork"" is made from pig ovaries retrieved from slaughterhouses, which are fertilized with pig semen, transforming them into embryos. They are then placed in a nutrient solution, where they grow and develop. It's a long way from the popular image of animals wandering round the farmyard in the sunshine, but then so is modern intensive farming. The factor that could take the research from the lab to the store and into refrigerators around the world is its remarkable commercial potential. According to New Harvest, meat is already estimated to be a $1 trillion global market, and demand is expected to double by 2050. With concerns about health, animal welfare and the environment growing the appeal of in vitro meat is obvious. Matheny told CNN that venture capitalists Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers have shown an interest in his technology, while Stegman, a sausage subsidiary of food giant Sara Lee, is a partner. The Netherlands' Government has also invested around $4 million in Dutch research into in-vitro meat production. But it isn't just the suits who are circling with their checkbooks out -- campaign group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) have announced a $1 million prize for the first commercially viable in vitro chicken product. The Humane Society of the United States has also been supportive. ""We think that a technology to produce cultured ground meats -- burgers, sausages, nuggets, and so forth -- could be commercialized within ten years,"" said Matheny. ""As with most technologies, successive generations should improve in price, quality, and acceptance. We don't think that matching the taste and texture of ground meats will be very difficult. Both conventional and cultured meat is made of muscle tissue. And conventional ground meat is typically highly processed. Chicken nuggets for instance, are made of something called 'meat slurry' -- it would be hard not to do better!"" Public attitude . But the public doesn't always blindly buy what companies believe they should, and acceptance of what is a very radical proposition certainly isn't a foregone conclusion. There are bound to be claims of ""Frankenfoods,"" and reaction against the work. ""Social acceptance isn't guaranteed, but we all want meat that's safer and healthier,"" he said. ""If cultured meat looks, tastes, and costs the same as regular meat, then I think acceptance will be high. The more we learn about the health and environmental impact of conventional meat, the more cultured meat looks like a good alternative."" One obvious touchstone for how in-vitro-meat will be received by the public is perhaps the way GM crops were -- or were not - accepted around the world, something that Matheny draws encouragement from. ""What's interesting about the GM issue is that it has been controversial in some places, but is a non-issue for most consumers,"" he said. ""Most Americans are regularly eating GM foods. In any case, it's not necessarily the case that cultured meat would involve GM foods. ""We all want meat that's safer and healthier. If cultured meat looks, tastes, and costs the same as regular meat, then do we care that it's produced in a steel tank, rather than in an animal farm? ""Take hydroponic vegetables. We like the idea that they're produced in sterile water instead of dirt and manure. It's true that in-vitro meat isn't natural. Nor for that matter are hydroponic vegetables, or bread, or cheese, or wine. Raising 10,000 chickens indoors and pumping them full of drugs isn't natural, either, and it isn't healthy or safe. The more we learn about how meat is produced now, the more in-vitro meat looks like a better alternative."" Lab-produced meat also raises some ethical considerations. Kate McMahon, Friends of the Earth Energy and Transport campaigner, believes more attention should be paid to improving livestock conditions rather than developing in-vitro meat. ""At a time when hundreds of small-scale, sustainable farming operations are filing for bankruptcy every day, it is unethical to consider purchasing petri dish meat. Rather, we should be making it easier and more affordable to raise livestock in a safe, humane and ecologically sensitive manner,"" she told CNN. Gillian Madill, Genetics Technologies spokesperson for Friends of the Earth, thinks that clear parameters for in-vitro development need to put in place: ""If we can successfully develop these products, what is the defining line between lab-grown meat and natural animals?"" she told CNN. ""That is an especially important question since a high level of differentiation and tissue complexity is required to replicate muscle tissue that we use as meat. We need to draw clear lines in order to prevent the commodification of all life."" Ultimately the success of in-vitro meat may be less about consumer sensibilities and more about the hard realities of feeding a growing global population in a finite world. ""With India and China doubling their meat consumption every decade, there's no sustainable way to satisfy the growing global appetite for meat without a significant improvement in technology,"" said Matheny. ""Cultured meat offers one solution. Improved plant-based meat substitutes offer another. I expect both will be needed."" Test tube burgers? It seems you could be eating them sooner than you might expect. What do you think of in-vitro meat? Do you think it could be a solution to the problems connected to meat production and climate change?

"(CNN) -- A tsunami watch issued for five nations after a 7.6-magnitude earthquake in the Indian Ocean was canceled about two hours later. A tsunami watch in effect after an earthquake in the Indian Ocean has been called off. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had issued the watch for India, Myanmar, Thailand, Indonesia and Bangladesh after the quake, which struck at 1:55 a.m. Tuesday (3:55 p.m. Monday ET). Its epicenter was about 163 miles (262 km) north of Port Blair in India's Andaman Islands, and 225 miles south-southwest of Pathein, Myanmar, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The earthquake's focus was about 20 miles below the Earth's surface. In general, earthquakes centered closer to the Earth's surface produce stronger shaking and can cause more damage than those further underground.  Watch where the earthquakes hit Â» .

The Inter Milan striker scored twice in the last 17 minutes, including one from the penalty spot, after Getafe's Ikechukwu Uche had given the Super Eagles as early lead. The result sees Nigeria move up to second place in the table with four points from their two games, two points behind leaders Tunisia who beat Mozambique 2-0 on Saturday to have maximum points from their two matches. Kenya are bottom of the table, without a point, and it already looks like Tunisia and Nigeria will battle it out for top spot in the group and automatic qualification for the World Cup finals. Elsewhere in Africa, Cameroon are surprisingly bottom of Group A after a 0-0 home draw with Morocco in Yaounde. The two group favorites cancelled each other out, meaning they both have a point apiece from their two matches. Gabon are the shock group leaders -- and they followed up their opening victory in Morocco by thumping an Emmanuel Adebayor-led Togo 3-0 in Libreville on Saturday. That result means Gabon are on six points, with Togo second on three points. Meanwhile, in Group E, Ivory Coast made it two wins from two matches to go top of the group with a 2-1 victory in Guinea.

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Divers found an eighth body Monday from the weekend collision of two aircraft over the Hudson River, leaving only one victim unaccounted for. Silvia Rigamonti, wife of one of the victims, walks with her son Davide Norelli in Bologna, Italy, on Monday. The man's body was found inside the submerged Piper Saratoga PA-32 fixed-wing plane that was carrying three people when it collided Saturday with a tourist helicopter carrying six people, police said. It was not immediately possible to remove the body, police said. The plane wreckage and the body were found on a day in which police divers worked in water made treacherous by poor visibility and strong currents. All six bodies of the people who were aboard the helicopter were pulled from water up to 50 feet deep over the weekend. Another body from among the three people who were aboard the private plane was found Saturday floating near Pier 40. Recovery operations were suspended late Monday afternoon and were to resume Tuesday morning, when the Army Corps of Engineers plans to lift the plane, police spokesman Paul Browne said. The victims aboard the helicopter included five tourists from Bologna, Italy, part of a group of 10 Bologna-area residents who were in New York to help a couple celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary, said Giovanni Castellaneta, Italy's ambassador to the United States.  See where the collision occurred Â» . The celebrating husband and one of the couple's sons were killed in the crash, but the wife skipped the sightseeing flight to go shopping, another son told Italian news media. The victims from Bologna were Michele Norelli, 51; Norelli's son Filippo Norelli, 16; Fabio Gallazzi, 49; Gallazzi's wife, Tiziana Pedroni, 44; and Gallazzi's son, Giacomo Gallazzi, 15. Michele Norelli's wife, Silvia Rigamonti, decided to visit New York stores instead of seeing its sights from above, the couple's eldest son, Davide Norelli, told Italian media. The Norellis were ecstatic to be spending their anniversary in New York, Davide Norelli told Stampa newspaper in Turin, Italy. ""They used to talk about their trip at dinner with enthusiasm, of their silver anniversary and how they were going to celebrate it together. My aunt gave them the trip as a gift,"" the paper quotes Davide Norelli saying. Davide Norelli, 23, also told Italian media that when he saw news of the crash on Saturday, he called his mother and was relieved at first because she answered. Then came the news that his father and brother died, which he had to relay to his 92-year-old paternal grandmother. The pilot of the helicopter -- a Eurocopter AS350 -- was Jeremy Clarke, 32. He had worked for Liberty Helicopter Sightseeing Tours for about 1Â½ years and had logged 2,700 helicopter flight hours, Hersman said. Killed aboard the plane were the owner and pilot, Steven Altman, 60, of Ambler, Pennsylvania; his brother, Daniel Altman, 49, of Dresher, Pennsylvania; and Daniel Altman's 16-year-old son, Douglas. The National Transportation Safety Board has begun to reconstruct what happened. The Piper took off from a Philadelphia-area airfield Saturday morning and landed at New Jersey's Teterboro Airport before taking off again, this time bound for Ocean City, New Jersey.  Watch why investigators are looking at the airspace Â» . The Piper pilot spoke after takeoff with the Teterboro tower, which handed him off electronically to the Newark tower, NTSB Chairman Debbie Hersman told reporters. But the pilot never contacted the Newark tower, she said. Controllers lost contact with the plane at 11:53 a.m., when it was at an altitude of about 1,100 feet, Hersman said.   Watch why investigators are looking at the airspace Â» . The helicopter was taking the five Italians on a 12-minute sightseeing tour around New York and had taken off from a heliport in midtown Manhattan shortly before the crash, Hersman said.  Hersman called the area ""very complex airspace"" near three major airports and a variety of other general aviation facilities. In an effort to determine just how complex, the Federal Aviation Administration found that, in each of the eight days prior to the crash, an average of 225 aircraft operated at or below 1,100 feet within a 3-mile radius of the accident site, she said. Below that altitude, aircraft can operate under visual flight regulations. The wreckage of the helicopter was pulled up Sunday, nearly intact, Hersman said on CNN's ""American Morning"" on Monday.  Watch the NTSB official discuss the accident Â» . Castellaneta said he had asked New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to help speed the inquiry into what happened. Bloomberg, who is a pilot, likened the crowded air corridor where the accident happened to a highway. ""Nobody is ever going to make every road perfectly safe or every trip in your automobile, and the same thing is true when you fly,"" he said. He added, ""Nothing we can say will bring them back, but our prayers are with them."" Investigators will focus on radio communications along the air corridor at the time of the crash and will examine any images contributed by the public. Neither aircraft was required to carry electronic data recorders -- often referred to as ""black boxes"" -- that record cockpit voices and flight information on larger planes. But electronic navigational devices on board might retain information that could help investigators, Hersman said. Liberty Helicopter Sightseeing Tours, since 1995, has had eight accidents and one ""incident,"" after which the NTSB made a number of safety recommendations, Hersman said. ""I think the fact that we are here today shows there is a lot of work that still needs to be done,"" she said. Saturday's crash was the company's first involving fatalities. Marcia Horowitz, a spokeswoman for the tour operator, said Liberty executives were working with investigators. ""The company is focusing its efforts on cooperating with the NTSB and giving as much information as it can,"" Horowitz said. ""At this time, their priority is to help with the family of their pilot and, of course, the families that were involved in the accident.""

That's the grim analogy offered by Paul Domjan, author of a new report, ""Carbon Scenarios: Blue sky thinking for a green future"", by the Stockholm Network, a London-based pan-European think tank. The report explores three scenarios on climate change, none of which leads to what's defined by the EU and UK as a 'successful outcome'; a greater than 90 percent chance of temperatures rising by no more than two degrees above pre-industrial levels. ""We have failed,"" Domjan says, adding, ""We will not prevent two degrees of warming."" Continuing the house fire analogy he says, ""The less than two degree scenario is a fire you can put out. With less than three degrees it spreads to other rooms but you can still put it out."" He says global policy of the past ten years looks more like the third -- and worst -- scenario explored by the Carbon Scenarios report -- the one dubbed ""Agree and Ignore.""  In that case, ""your house is unrecognizably destroyed. The positive feedback cycle isn't contained. Your house catches fire, your neighbor's catches fire..."" And so on. Domjan blames the failure of the current climate change policy on the constant stream of compromises by world leaders designed to keep the Kyoto agreement intact. ""This dynamic of making lots of small compromises in order to keep the agreement in place has led to a situation where the agreement has lost a lot of its teeth."" He points to Canada as an example, a signatory to the Kyoto agreement which has ""done nothing"" to implement it. ""During the time it's been a signatory it's been developing massive coal sands projects which are the most polluting way of producing gas and oil in the world,"" he says. ""There's a great international censure against the U.S. for not ratifying Kyoto but nothing has been said about Canada."" ""The coal sands are using so much natural gas and electricity they could have an entire nuclear facility just for themselves."" The three alternative futures explored in the Carbon Scenarios report include ""Kyoto Plus,"" ""Agree and Ignore"" and ""Step Change."" ""Kyoto Plus"" envisages a gradual transition to a global cap on carbon emissions by 2012. Domjan calls it a ""largely successful scenario"" where there's a greater than 90 percent chance of global average temperatures rising more than 3.31 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. ""That's not a disaster. It's still a world that's recognizable,"" he says. The second scenario -- ""Agree and Ignore"" -- predicts efforts to reduce carbon emissions will ""stall and backslide"" leading to ""competitive regionalism."" There would be a greater than 90 percent chance of global average temperatures rising no more than 4.8 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. From that point, temperatures would continue to rise into the next century. The third scenario -- ""Step Change"" -- imagines a radical shift in global policy direction. World leaders would introduce a system of global carbon caps, giving them greater than 90 percent chance of limiting the rise in global average temperatures to 2.85 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. Of the three scenarios, ""Step Change"" is the one Domjan personally prefers but the one he concedes is unlikely to happen. ""Our proposal [for a global upstream cap] is similar to but not identical to the proposal from the Kyoto 2 project,"" he says. ""It's a line of thinking that's been around for a while that will provide a healthy alternative to emissions trading."" Under the scheme, the United Nations would impose an annual cap on the amount of carbon that could be produced from fossil fuels. Natural resource companies would have to apply and pay for permits to produce carbon. Compliance would be determined at key points, for example, coal washing stations. ""The problem is how do you get the political impetus to have a big international change like that and for people to accept that this is genuinely going to be dealt with at an international level,"" Domjan asks. The ""Step Change"" scenario supposes that the impetus comes through a threat to U.S. and Chinese economic security. Under the scenario, climate change threatens Sino-U.S.. trade relations so the two combine to lead and enforce global change. ""Our current approach to climate change is moving at the pace of the slowest country,"" Domjan says, adding, ""Here they say we're going to move as quickly as possible and then force others to catch up."" Under that scenario, the need to purchase carbon production permits would push record oil prices even higher as energy companies pass on the cost to consumers. Domjan is confident the global economy could cope -- it's adapted to higher energy prices so far and is likely to prove equally resilient in the future. And the extra cost of fuel, rather going to producers, would be held in a fund controlled by the United Nations. It would be used to help developing nations to use fewer fossil fuels, to support new research and development, to compensate oil producers for the carbon they're not producing, and to establish an emergency fund to deal with the consequences of climate change. Domjan acknowledges that world leaders are unlikely to use the report as the basis for a new global policy, but he hopes they at least take away two key points: ""Whenever possible regulate at the point where there are fewest participants [and] we need to make sure there's a clear price signal so the market can distribute energy efficiently.""","Carbon Scenarios report says EU, UK global warming targets ""unrealistic""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Divers on Tuesday recovered the bodies of the final two of nine victims of Saturday's collision between a helicopter and small plane over the Hudson River, police said. The wreckage of a PA-32 that collided Saturday with a helicopter is lifted Tuesday from the bed of the Hudson River. ""They were inside the wreckage when we pulled it up,"" said New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. Earlier Tuesday, police divers had attached chains and straps to the plane's fuselage and used a crane to lift it from the riverbed 60 feet below the surface. On Saturday, the Piper PA-32 Saratoga carrying three people collided with a helicopter carrying six people, five of them Italian tourists, killing all nine people aboard both aircraft. The wreckage of the helicopter, operated by Liberty Helicopter Sightseeing Tours, was lifted Sunday nearly intact from the Hudson. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the collision, which occurred shortly after the helicopter took off from a heliport in Midtown Manhattan on what was to have been a 12-minute sightseeing tour around New York. The Piper took off from New Jersey's Teterboro Airport and was bound for Ocean City, New Jersey. It began its flight Saturday morning at a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-area airfield.

"WICHITA, Kansas (CNN)  -- Scott Roeder's ex-wife said she believes her former spouse was capable of murder. Scott Roeder, 51, is being held on a first-degree murder charge and two counts of aggravated assault. Roeder, 51, is sitting in a Kansas jail, charged with murdering George Tiller, one of the few U.S. doctors who performed late-term abortion. ""He was determined that if the abortion doctor killed the baby, then he didn't have any right to live either,"" Roeder's ex-wife Lindsey Roeder told reporters on Monday, refusing to show her face to cameras. Lindsey Roeder said their 10-year marriage ended 13 years ago in part because he had a fanatical preoccupation with certain views, including those on abortion. She said her ex-husband believed killing an abortion provider ""is justifiable,"" and described him as self-righteous and someone who may be capable of murder. Scott Roeder was charged Tuesday with one count of first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated assault stemming from Tiller's shooting death at Tiller's Wichita church Sunday morning.  Watch panel discuss ramifications of slaying Â» . During a brief initial court appearance, in which he appeared via video from the county jail, Roeder requested a court-appointed lawyer. He has made no plea, and a preliminary hearing is scheduled for June 16. Police have not disclosed a possible motive in Tiller's killing. But associates have told CNN that Roeder was a regular among the anti-abortion protesters who routinely gathered at Tiller's Wichita clinic, Women's Health Care Services. And records and interviews with family and fellow abortion protesters suggest Roeder had a fanatical preoccupation with abortion and used Christianity to support his beliefs. In 1996, he was arrested in Topeka, Kansas, with explosives, a military rifle, ammunition and a gas mask in his car, according to records. His ex-wife said that at that time he intended to blow up an abortion clinic. A Shawnee County judge called Roeder a ""substantial threat to public safety"" telling him that one must follow the law as established, not the law as one might wish it to be. Roeder pleaded not guilty, spent 16 months in prison and eight on probation. But his lawyer argued on appeal that his car had been illegally searched, and Roeder's conviction was vacated. He became known as a regular at protests outside abortion clinics, say those who rallied alongside him. Anti-abortion activists Anthony Leake and Regina Dinwiddie told CNN that Tiller had strong beliefs. ""He was a confessing Christian,"" Leake continued. ""He always had his Bible, which wasn't uncommon. He professed faith in Jesus Christ."" A man named Scott Roeder signed a message on the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue's Web site in 2007, calling for prayers to shut down Tiller's ""death camp."" ""Sometime soon, would it be feasible to organize as many people as possible to attend Tillers church (inside, not just outside) to have much more of a presence and possibly ask questions of the pastor, deacons, elders and members while there? Doesn't seem like it would hurt anything but bring more attention to Tiller,"" the message reads. National anti-abortion organizations, including Operation Rescue, condemned Tiller's slaying. ""[The alleged killer] is not one of us, and if he thinks he is, then he is deluded,"" said the Rev. Gary Cass, the director of the Christian Anti-Defamation Commission. Dinwiddie, a 54-year-old grandmother, said Roeder once told her that he confronted a doctor at a Planned Parenthood center, telling the physician, ""Now I know what you look like."" ""We all said, 'Scott, you better leave or they are gonna get after you,' "" Dinwiddie said. ""Next thing, all these people come rushing out of the place, all worried. Scott was standing up for what he believed in."" In the mid-1990s, police said he was also possibly linked to the Freemen, an anti-government group based in Montana. Eugene Frye, who says he has known Roeder for years as an anti-tax campaigner, said just Roeder showed up at a recent abortion protest talking about this year's trial of Tiller, whom Frye called the ""killer."" Tiller was acquitted in March of 19 misdemeanor counts of performing unlawful procedures at his clinic, and Frye said Roeder told him he had attended the trial.  See what people are saying about Tiller's slaying Â» . ""He just said he'd been down there, and that the trial was a sham,"" Frye said. But he said he was surprised that Roeder was a suspect in Tiller's death, saying he never spoke of any kind of violence.  Tiller describes the philosophy of his clinic in 1999 Â» .

"(CNN) -- Tributes have been flooding in following the sudden death of Spanish Primera Liga side Espanyol's captain Daniel Jarque at the age of 26 on Saturday night. Espanyol fans have begun a memorial for captain Daniel Jarque following his sudden death on Saturday. Jarque passed away around 8pm local time when his heart stopped following a training session in Coverciano, Italy, where the squad are on a pre-season camp. Reports suggest Jarque was on the phone to his fiancee -- who is eight months pregnant -- at the time and she alerted two of his team-mates, who raced to his hotel room. Club doctors and Italian paramedics tried to revive Jarque, a product of the Espanyol youth system, but without success. Most Spanish clubs immediately expressed their condolences and leading footballing personalities have now done the same. Speaking on the official Real Madrid Web site, club captain Raul said: ""As captain, and on behalf of the whole Real Madrid team, I want to express our sincere condolences. ""We will support the player's family and the Espanyol family in any way possible during this very difficult time for everybody. ""He was a great professional and sportsman and this has left us all very hurt. We offer our most sincere sympathies,"" added Raul. Jarque's death comes two years after that of Sevilla and Spain defender Antonio Puerta, who suffered multiple organ failure in hospital, three days after a cardiac arrest during a league match against Getafe. Madrid coach Manuel Pellegrini added: ""It is news that you wish wasn't true. It's terrible, it already happened a couple of years ago to Sevilla and the truth is these things have an impact."" Joan Laporta, president of European champions Barcelona -- Espanyol's city rivals -- said on their official Web site: """"We are very shocked by this tragic event. ""We are all in mourning and I wish to express in the name of FC Barcelona our heartfelt condolences to Espanyol on the painful loss of their captain Dani Jarque, and also to his family"". Jarque joined Espanyol at the age of 12, making his debut in 2002, and was handed the captaincy this summer. Fans have been flocking to Espanyol's stadium since the news broke and have been in mourning outside gate 21 -- Jarque's squad number. Former Espanyol coach Ramon Moya, who handed Jarque his debut against Rayo Vallecano, was deeply shocked. ""I feel like I have lost a son,"" he told reporters. ""Jarque was a footballer, but he was also my friend. This situation is very difficult for a person. It was as if he was family. I knew him for many years. I gave him his debut and I shared many moments with him. It's very difficult to explain how I feel at the moment."" Another former coach, Ernesto Valverde, insisted Jarque had never had any medical problems previously. ""After hearing the news I still haven't taken it in,"" said the current Villarreal coach. ""He was a player who was super strong, super healthy and very important in the dressing room. We got goosebumps when we heard the news. He was a very strong person but life is like that and it gives you terrible surprises. "" Espanyol, who had been due to play Bologna in a friendly match on Sunday, suspended their pre-season tour of Italy and have flown back to Barcelona.","Tributes are flooding in following the sudden death of Espanyol's Daniel Jarque .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A rare and original manuscript of one of America's most patriotic songs has been discovered in a flea market bargain. The manuscript of the song could be worth tens of thousands of dollars. A shopper browsing through the market in New York bought a framed picture of a flower for $10 and found handwritten manuscript of ""America"" (My Country 'tis of Thee) tucked behind the picture, the manuscript's owner said Thursday. The manuscript of the song whose lyrics were written by Samuel Francis Smith in 1831 could be worth tens of thousands of dollars, said the owner, art collector Keya Morgan. He said he bought it from the flea market shopper, who has asked not to be identified. The song was intended to be played in schools to inspire and teach children and was first played in public on July 4, 1831, in the First Baptist Church in Newton, Massachusetts, Morgan said. The song is written to the tune of ""God Save the Queen,"" the national anthem of the United Kingdom.  Take a look at the manuscript Â» . The authenticity of the document was confirmed by Morgan, a handwriting expert who has been authenticating historical documents for nearly a decade, and Diana Yount, an archival specialist at Andover Newton Theological School. Yount reached her conclusion after comparing the handwriting with that in a hymn written by Smith. Morgan, whose collection includes artifacts from Abraham Lincoln, Marilyn Monroe, Thomas Jefferson and Ulysses S. Grant, was ecstatic. ""It's the biggest high I could get,"" said Morgan.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The view will be one unlike any other. Climbing up through the clouds at a rate faster than the speed of sound, the sky will darken to a deep blue and then to black. Below, entire mountain ranges, coastlines and cities will shift into focus as the horizon bends around the curvature of the Earth - the thin veil of its atmosphere shimmering against a backdrop of stars. An emerging space tourism industry may give thousands of travelers a new view of Earth. And then, of course, there will be the feeling of weightlessness. ""It is just life changing,"" said Col. Richard Searfoss, a retired NASA shuttle commander.""To be outside the atmosphere and see the curvature of the Earth and see so much land area at once, it gives you a sense of separateness but connectedness."" The view of Earth from outer space is a sight that in the history of mankind only a few hundred people have ever seen. But that could soon change as what was once an almost nonexistent space tourism industry slowly matures into what some analysts predict could be a billion dollar enterprise with thousands of passengers by the end of the next decade. ""This is just the beginning of the golden age of space flight,"" said Peter Diamandis, chairman of the X Prize Foundation, which awarded the $10 million Ansari X Prize in 2004 for the first privately funded human flight to the edge of space.""Looking back a thousand years from now, this will be the period of time when the human race irrevocably moved off the planet."" Look back roughly ten years, though, and the idea of sending tourists into space seemed more like science fiction than a viable business plan, said John Gedmark, executive director of the Personal Spaceflight Federation, a trade association representing the space travel industry. ""No one ever thought this was real at all,"" said Gedmark.""It was just completely unthinkable."" But that perception began to change in 2001 when American multimillionaire Dennis Tito became the world's first so-called space tourist, traveling aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule to the International Space Station for a price of around $20 million. Four more tourists have since made the trip. Another major milestone for the industry has been a growing interest and investment from entrepreneurs like Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who financed the development of SpaceShipOne, winner of the Ansari X Prize, and British billionaire Richard Branson, founder of the space tourism company, Virgin Galactic. ""Since then the activity has been more evenly spread and steadier and more consistent and more determined,"" said Gedmark. ""Now you have a number of companies working on multiple fronts to get people into space."" There are now at least a dozen space tourism endeavors worldwide, offering experiences that range from a flight to the fringe of space to astronaut training on a tropical island. While the companies make up a varied landscape of technological know-how, financial wherewithal and enterprising ideas, they all share one common goal: The desire to conquer what is widely considered to be the final frontier of mankind -- the universe. ""The human species is about evolution and is about moving forward,"" said Eric Anderson, president of Space Adventures Ltd., the Virginia-based company responsible for arranging civilian trips to the space station on the Soyuz. ""Space is filled with infinite resources that can make our lives better."" This October, Richard Garriott, a computer-game developer and son of former NASA astronaut Owen Garriott, is scheduled to become Space Adventures' sixth client to leave the planet followed by a seventh yet-to-be identified passenger next April. Space Adventures is also planning to build commercial spaceports near Dubai and in Singapore. But Anderson said the next big step involves something slightly further afield - a trip to the Moon. With a price tag of $100 million per seat, two tourists and a pilot would spend around two weeks board a modified Russian spacecraft with the chance to see an Earth rise from lunar orbit and cruise around the far side of the Moon. The excursion will launch when contracts are finalized with travelers, Space Adventures said. Suborbital space tourism is also set to take off soon. For $200,000, Virgin Galactic passengers will undergo several days of training before taking a two-hour flight to the fringe of space - 70 miles above sea level.  From there, the company says, passengers will experience the feeling of weightlessness and see a view of the Earth that spans a 1,000 miles in any direction. Will Whitehorn, president of Virgin Galactic, said the company has collected $35 million in deposits from 250 would-be space tourists. Another 80,000 have registered interest with the company, he said. ""That figure has been growing month by month the past year, especially as we get finished building the technology,"" said Whitehorn. Virgin will begin testing WhiteKnightTwo this summer, said Whitehorn.  The carrier vehicle will ferry suborbital craft SpaceShipTwo, modeled after Ansari X Prize winner SpaceShipOne, 50,000 feet in the sky before releasing it. ""Once we have tested that sufficiently, we will put the spaceship underneath it,"" said Whitehorn. Other companies are also jumping in the suborbital space race. In March, California-based XCOR Aerospace announced plans to build the Lynx, a two-seater rocketship that will carry passengers up into the atmosphere for about $100,000. The vehicle will be the size of a small business jet, capable of making several flights a day, the company said. And last year, European aerospace giant EADS announced plans for its Astrium space division to develop a line of suborbital jets to satisfy a space tourism market that it predicts could grow to as many as 15,000 passengers a year by 2020. ""The market is there,"" said Robert Laine, chief technical officer of EADS Astrium.""The question is how to build the planes that can satisfy that market and to understand what profits at the end we can make out of it."" .......................

"LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- Police executed a search warrant at a Las Vegas pharmacy Tuesday morning in connection with the investigation into Michael Jackson's death, a federal drug agent said. A Las Vegas pharmacy was searched Tuesday in connection with Michael Jackson's death. Applied Pharmacy on Flamingo Road in Las Vegas sold the anesthetic propofol to Dr. Conrad Murray, Jackson's doctor, a source familiar with the investigation said. Another source close to the investigation said last month that Murray, a Texas-based cardiologist, is said to have given Jackson propofol, commonly known by the brand name Diprivan, in the 24 hours before he died. The search of Applied Pharmacy came two weeks after searches of Murray's home and clinic in Las Vegas. The search warrant served Tuesday authorized investigators to seize documents -- both on computers and paper -- related to the Jackson investigation, DEA Assistant Special Agent in Charge Mike Flanagan said. The warrants used for those earlier searches, which were filed in a Clark County, Nevada, court, imply that investigators looking into Jackson's death believe that the singer was a drug addict. The warrants, signed by District Judge Timothy Williams and given to CNN by Las Vegas affiliate KTNV, say that ""there is probable cause to believe"" that the searches would uncover evidence at Murray's home and office of excessive prescribing, prescribing to an addict, prescribing to or treating an addict and manslaughter. They cite ""probable cause to believe"" that the premises contained ""records, shipping orders, distribution lists, use records relating to the purchase, transfer ordering, delivery and storage of propofol (Diprivan)."" Murray was with Jackson on June 25 when he was rushed to UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles and when he was pronounced dead, according to Murray's lawyer. A source involved with the inquiry into Jackson's death has said that investigators found numerous bottles of prescription drugs in his $100,000-a-month rented mansion in Holmby Hills, California. The items taken from Murray's home included copies of his computer and cell phone hard drives. They were to be turned over to the Los Angeles Police Department, which is leading the investigation into Jackson's death at age 50. A ""thorough and comprehensive"" report into the death of Michael Jackson is complete, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said Monday, but police have requested that the report not be released because of the ongoing investigation. The coroner's office said it would abide by the request that ""the cause and manner of death remain confidential"" and referred all questions to the Los Angeles Police Department.

"(CNN) -- As Walter Thomas knows, it's hard to look for a job when your stomach is rumbling. Samirah, 2, asked her mom to take this photo to show that hungry people ""are like everyone else."" The 52-year-old from Washington, D.C.,  started skipping meals in early January when his savings account was running dry and his kitchen cabinets were almost empty. Thomas at first didn't want to turn to the United States' food safety net, the food stamp program, for help. But after being laid off in July from what seemed like a steady job in sales at a furniture store, Thomas swallowed his pride and applied for the monthly food aid. ""It lets me think, 'OK, well, tomorrow I'll be able to eat. If nothing else, I'll be able to eat,' "" he said. With the national economy in meltdown, more Americans than ever are relying on the federal aid program to keep from going hungry. In October, more than one in 10 people -- about 31 million -- were using the food stamp program to get by, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. More recent numbers are not available, but advocates for the poor say the number of those in need of aid probably has increased since then. Stereotypes associated with food stamps abound, and recipients are often seen as prone to taking handouts, sometimes when they may not be needed. But the profile of hunger in America is multifaceted, as diverse as the nation itself, especially in these times of economic hardship. To get a better idea of what it's like to live on a food stamp budget, CNN correspondent Sean Callebs has decided to eat for a month on $176 and blog about the experience on CNN.com.  Watch reporter's struggle to buy food with food stamps Â» . That's a situation many people, Thomas included, can relate to. Thomas, who said he had been working steadily since he was 13 years old, now receives $175 per month for food. That's about $5.83 per day -- less than $2 per meal.  See what people on food stamps can buy Â» . Not that Thomas is complaining. After getting his first payment, which is added to an inconspicuous debit card to reduce the stigma associated with the program, Thomas went straight to the grocery store. He was hungry and grateful. ""It's definitely been a blessing to me,"" he said of the food stamp program, which, since October, has gone by the name Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Advocates for the poor, as well as those on federal assistance, hope President Obama's economic stimulus plan will increase food stamp payments. The average family on food stamps would receive $79 more per month if the stimulus bill passes in the U.S. Senate this week, according to The New York Times. iReport.com: How are you doing in this tough economy? There is some debate about whether giving people money to spend on groceries is a valid form of economic stimulus. Few are more hopeful the measure will pass than Crystal Sears, a 30-year-old mother in Germantown, Pennsylvania, who said she has been on food stamps for more than three years. Sears said she sometimes skips meals so her three children can eat. Even with federal assistance, she said, she sometimes has to make a meal for herself out of crackers or food scraps. She said she has been out of work for several years because all three of her children have medical conditions: Her 8-year-old son has a seizure disorder that requires frequent hospital visits and constant attention; her 2-year-old daughter was born with heart problems; and her 12-year-old daughter has scoliosis, a back condition that recently required two surgeries, she said. Without much money, she's forced to make tough choices. ""If the kids needed sneakers and their sneakers are getting too small, or if my water bill is past due, I'd opt not to pay it and risk them sending me a shut-off notice just so my children can eat,"" she said. Sometimes she chooses to buy more food instead of paying her gas bill to heat her home. When she does, the family sleeps huddled around their stove or an electric heater, she said. Her monthly food stamp payment is $489, she said. That's sometimes sufficient. But some months, she said, she doesn't receive full payments because of mix-ups with paperwork. Until recently, she said, she received about $250 per month, which she said was far from enough to feed her family of four. The SNAP program is meant to supplement a person's food budget, not cover all food expenses, said Jean Daniel, a spokesperson for the USDA, which administers the program. Taking on part-time work would further complicate the application process, she said. Sears said she worked for seven years at a Salvation Army shelter before becoming unemployed. ""For me, I've always been a helper. And my thing is I don't like to help people to enable them. I like to help people so they can help themselves in the long run,"" she said. Sears stretches her food budget by buying cheap and sometimes fatty meals. She said she doesn't like doing that but can't avoid it. With food prices high, she said, grocery shopping is stressful. ""We get like the mac and cheese, which is dehydrated cheese -- basically food that's no good for you health wise,"" she said. ""Everything is high in sodium and trans fats ... and that's all we basically can afford. There's not enough assistance to eat healthy and maintain a healthy weight."" Advocates for the hungry say many people on the food stamp program opt to buy less-healthy foods because they can't afford fresh fruits and vegetables on such a tight budget. Food stamp ""benefits aren't really enough for a healthy diet,"" said Jim Weill, president of the nonprofit Food Research and Action Center. Sears said she is grateful for the help she does get. Maribel Diaz, a 36-year-old mother of three boys in Los Angeles, California, said her $319-per-month payment isn't always enough. But she said she would starve herself before letting her boys go hungry. ""You're bringing home less bags [of food] now, because the milk is almost $5 a gallon and the bread is $3 a loaf. ... A chicken is, like, now $8,"" Diaz said. ""If you're really breaking it down, you're not bringing a lot of groceries home."" All SNAP recipients are eligible for free nutritional counseling to help people stretch their food budgets, said Daniel, of the USDA. Advocates for the hungry find flaws in the way the program is set up, but they praise it for being a safety net the government can't take away during tough times. Unlike aid to soup kitchens, the food stamp program receives federal funding in times thick and thin, and has a $6 billion backup fund, Daniel said. ""The money will be found so people are not turned away,"" Daniel said. All of the benefits paid to participants come from the federal government. States split the program's administrative costs. Advocates see some flaws in SNAP but generally give it praise. ""I say about food stamps what Winston Churchill said about democracy: 'It's the worst possible system except all the others,' "" said Joel Berg, executive director of the New York Coalition Against Hunger. Berg said the program's benefits are too small and too difficult for people to obtain. But the food stamp program is somewhat successful, he said. ""The main purpose of the program is to wipe out Third World starvation in America, and it's worked,"" he said, adding that he's optimistic about improvements that could come as part of the economic stimulus plan. Thomas, the laid-off furniture worker in Washington, said he doesn't want people to feel sorry for him. After being let go from his store, he stopped at an employment center before going anywhere else. He said he faxed about 20 rÃ©sumÃ©s to similar companies on that very day. None has resulted in a job yet, but Thomas said he has been to interviews for other types of work and hopes employment will come soon. For now, he's just happy to continue the job search without the pain of hunger nagging at his stomach.","More than 1 in 10 Americans are part of the federal food assistance program .

The wedding was at the courthouse in Choteau, Montana, on Thursday, he said, according to quotes from CBS' ""Late Show with David Letterman"" provided to CNN by Letterman's publicist, Tom Keaney. ""Regina and I began dating in February of 1986, and I said, 'Well, things are going pretty good, let's just see what happens in about 10 years ... ,"" he joked during the taping.  Watch Letterman spill the beans Â» . ""I had avoided getting married pretty good [sic] for, like, 23 years, and ... honestly, whether this happened or not, I secretly felt that men who were married admired me -- like I was the last of the real gunslingers."" Lasko is a former ""Late Show"" staffer. The couple have a son, Harry. Letterman told his audience that the wedding almost didn't happen after the couple, son in tow, got their pickup truck stuck in the mud on the way to the ceremony. ""So I get out of the truck and I walk two miles back to the house into a 50 mph wind. It's not Beverly Hills, it's Montana, for God's sakes,' "" he said. ""And the whole way, I'm thinking, 'See, smartass? See? See? You try to get married, this is what happens.' "" When he returned with a car, he said -- presumably joking -- that his son was disappointed, ""because mom had told him if I wasn't back in an hour, the deal was off.""","Talk-show host marries Regina Lasko, who he began dating in 1986 .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- To understand how close Kanye West and his mother, Donda, were, one only needs to listen to his music. Donda and Kanye West, here during her book tour, were very close. He regularly made reference to her in his lyrics, discussing everything from her insistence that he receive a college degree to her unshakeable support of him when he ultimately decided to pursue a rap career. Donda West, who died at 58 over the weekend, appeared to be as tough as she was loving. On ""Can't Tell Me Nothing,"" a track from his latest album, ""Graduation,"" he rhymes about his mother's attempt to discourage him from spending money on jewelry and ""Louis V."" On ""Touch the Sky,"" from his 2005 album, ""Late Registration,"" he recalls how his mother drove him from Chicago, Illinois, to New York in a U-Haul van. (Read the obituary of Donda West.) She was also the inspiration for the song ""Hey Mama,"" from the same album. ""I want to scream so loud for you/ because I'm so proud of you,"" he rhymes. ""I know I act a fool/ but I promise you I'm going back to school/ I appreciate what you allowed for me and I just want you to be proud of me.""  Watch how Kanye West is mourning his mother Â» .

As Kanye West whipped the crowd into a frenzy with hits such as ""Gold Digger"" and ""Through the Wire,"" his mom waved her hands in the air side to side and bobbed to the beats. When asked if her son would sell more records than 50 Cent (both rappers released their albums on September 11), she answered coyly. ""Good music will win out,"" she said with a smile and a wink.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The British mother of a child who died after being brutally abused has been jailed indefinitely. A police computer image of some of the facial injuries suffered by baby Peter. The child's -- originally known as Baby P --horrifying death caused a furor in Britain, with the media, public and politicians united in demanding to know how his terrible injuries were missed by social workers, police and medical staff. Judge Stephen Kramer also Friday jailed the 27-year-old mum's boyfriend for life with a minimum of 12 years and their lodger, Jason Owen, 37, indefinitely but with a minimum of three years, the British Press Association reported. The boyfriend, 32, was also convicted of raping a two-year-old girl. Baby P's mum has to serve a minimum of five years. She and her boyfriend cannot be named. Baby P -- he could not be known by his first name, Peter, until the recent lifting of a court order -- was only 17 months old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered cot in August 2007. He had more than 50 injuries, including a broken back and fractured ribs, despite being on London's Haringey council's at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, doctors and police over eight months. The resulting public outrage saw the government's child secretary, Ed Balls, step in to demand the removal of the council's head of children's services, Sharon Shoesmith, with two other leading officials also stepping down. Shoesmith had to be placed under police guard after death threats were made. Judge Kramer told Peter's mother that she was ""a manipulative and self-centered person, with a calculating side as well as a temper.""  Watch more on the case Â» . ""Your conduct over the months prevented Peter from being seen by social services. You actively deceived the authorities... you acted selfishly because your priority was your relationship,"" he told the court, PA reported. Judge Kramer's comments echoed the country's response to the case. ""Any decent person who heard the catalogue of medical conditions and non-accidental injuries suffered by Peter cannot fail to have been appalled."" A second serious review of the case commissioned by Balls and released Friday, also reiterated that Peter's death  ""could and should have been prevented."" Graham Badman, the chairman of Haringey Local Safeguarding Children Board, which conducted the review said: ""I believe the most important lesson arising from this case is that professionals charged with ensuring child safety must be deeply skeptical of any explanations, justifications or excuses they may hear in connection with the apparent maltreatment of children. ""If they have any doubt about the cause of physical injuries or what appears to be maltreatment, they should act swiftly and decisively. Badman said the review found that if ""doctors, lawyers, police officers and social workers had adopted a more urgent, thorough and challenging approach, the case would have been stopped in its tracks at the first serious incident."" ""Baby Peter deserved better from the services that were supposed to protect him,"" Badman said.","British mother of child who died after brutal abuse has been jailed indefinitely .

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- ""Easy money, fast and effective."" Investors protest outside the headquarters of DMG, one of many companies accused of defrauding the public. That was the name of one of the businesses in which millions of Colombians deposited their life savings after being promised short-term returns of as much as 150 percent. But government officials say the businesses were pyramid schemes that raked in at least $200 million from 3 million people. The government has said it knows who most of those responsible are, but they have escaped. The government is tracking them down. Sergio Munoz is among those who lost their savings. ""That was for my children,"" he said. ""Now, it comes to light that they have robbed us. It was with complicity of the authorities who permit this -- knowing that it is illegal for it to be permitted."" The government says the businesses defrauded the public by offering false promises of a sure investment. Wilson Rodriguez handed over the equivalent of $80,000 to a money man who offered him what he thought were assets in hotels and property in exchange. Now, he doesn't know whom to approach. ""I don't even have enough to care for my family,"" he said. ""I lent money and what I make from my salary goes to pay off debts. I have nothing. I lost everything."" Infuriated investors have demonstrated outside the headquarters of several companies in question across the nation. Worried that the situation has already led to physical altercations and riots, President Alvaro Uribe asked that authorities act immediately to bring those responsible to justice. ""We are asking the public prosecutor to speed up the resolution of the cases,"" he said. ""The national police has handed to the prosecution the power to intervene in pyramids."" Treasury Minister Oscar Ivan Zuluaga said the government is not to blame. ""The government had advertised all this time about the illegality of this operation, warning Colombians not to let themselves be defrauded, not to take their money to these illegal activities,"" he said. Meanwhile, some observers complain that, though the investors may shoulder some blame, the government could have mitigated their losses by moving more quickly. And, they note, some of the alleged pyramid schemes continue to stay in business.","Pyramid schemes robbed 3 million Colombians of at least $200 million, officials say .
