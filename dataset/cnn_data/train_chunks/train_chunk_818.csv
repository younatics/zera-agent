"By . Lillian Radulova . Winter may not be too far off, but the autumn heatwave across Australia's east coast is only just finishing up in some cities while Sydney shows no signs of slowing down. Reaching a top of 23 degrees, Saturday was the fifteenth consecutive day in a row that the average temperature for May - 22 degrees - has been exceeded in Sydney. Melbourne has also smashed records set in the same month of 1972 this week, recording 12 consecutive days of temperatures reaching above 20 degrees, before slumping back down again on Saturday. In the south, Adelaide matched some of its best records since May in 1918 this month, when Thursday became the 10th consecutive day of 22 degrees or more in May, which usually has an average maximum of less than 19 degrees. A heatwave has been warming the streets of Sydney for the last two weeks while breaking records as the longest recorded since 1910 . The summer of 2013/2014 also broke a number of records across the country for high maximum temperatures recorded, according to the Climate Council's Angry Summer report . Adelaide also recorded its hottest temperature in the month before winter since more than a century ago, when it reached 27.4 degrees on May 16. Even Hobart recorded a record breaking 23.9 degrees last Thursday as high-pressure systems pushed cold fronts further south than usual. The extended heatwaves come just after the most recent summer of 2013/2014, broke records across the country with the consistently high maximum temperatures recorded. Heatwaves are considered to occur when temperatures reach a high maximum and minimum which are unusual for the location for at least three days in a row, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Melbourne also recorded a hotter than ever month of May with 12 consecutive days of temperatures reaching above 20 degrees . Adelaide had its hottest temperature in May in more than a century on the 16th at 27.4 degrees . But although Melbourne and South Australia have dropped back to cooler average temperatures, Sydney shows no sign of dropping down, with the last fortnight setting a record for Australia's major city, as the last longest recorded heatwave since 1910 which only lasted for seven days in August of 1995, according to Scorcher. The Harbour City's record for the average maximum temperature for the month of May is also predicted to be broken in 2014, which was set at 22.7 degrees in 1958. The above average temperatures are only set to continue for the next week or so. The current heatwave is expected to continue, with the State of the Climate 2014 report stating that the duration, frequency and intensity of heatwaves have been on the increase across Australia since the 1950s . The city's beach-goers are certainly happy about the warmer weather, with water temperatures reaching almost 23 degrees at Bondi on Saturday . But the rise in heatwaves is no surprise for some, with the State of the Climate 2014 report, compiled by The Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO, claiming that duration, frequency and intensity of heatwaves have increased across Australia long since the 1950s. Eastern Australia in particular, has been subject to an increase in these weather conditions. But despite presenting the best opportunity for beach-goers, with water temperatures reaching almost 23 degrees at Bondi, an increase in the amount and duration of heatwaves presents many concerns. Heatwaves have so far killed more people than any other natural disaster, including bushfires in the last 200 years. Although providing appealing weather for Sydney-siders this weekend, the long term hazards of heatwaves are severe with the weather event causing more deaths than any natural disaster across the country, . Heatwaves also have adverse affects for wildlife and agriculture as well as causing damage to infrastructure such as transport and electricity systems . The the dry conditions also mean that the area's affected are subject to drier conditions for longer periods, increasing the risk of fires and essentially leading to a potentially longer fire season. Farmers and further down the track, consumers can also be badly affected by agricultural losses from heatwaves as particular crops require certain temperature thresholds to grow plentifully. Australian fauna are also at risk as heatwaves continue to rage, with flying foxes, birds and marsupials particularly vulnerable. The Climate Council's Angry Summer report lists a range of additional problems related to heatwaves, surprisingly including a reduction in workplace productivity and damage of infrastructure such as transport and electricity systems.","Sydney breaks its record for longest heatwave since 1910 .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A former British Airways captain who blew the whistle on a pilot who took off despite having a collision on a runway, has lost his £110,000 claim that he was unfairly forced out by his new employer. Whistle-blower Captain Graham Howard said he was sacked for bringing an ‘unwelcome focus’ on Blink Ltd after taking his worries to the Civil Aviation Authority. The 63-year-old - who has 35 years' flying experience - raised his concerns after a series of incidents the company, which charters planes for celebrities and businessmen to 600 European destinations. Whistle-blower Captain Graham Howard said he was sacked for bringing an 'unwelcome focus' on the company after taking his worries to the Civil Aviation Authority . Capt Howard claimed that a colleague risked committing a criminal offence by flying a damaged plane without getting clearance after the runway incident in Salerno, Italy. In another alleged blunder, the same pilot flew an over-fuelled plane and failed to report the error correctly to the authorities. However Capt Howard failed in his claim for £110,000 in lost earnings after the tribunal panel ruled he had, in fact, been dismissed for attempting to force the removal of Capt Paul Horrocks. Capt Howard told an employment tribunal in Reading, Berkshire, that Capt Horrocks flew an aeroplane with a damaged wing after he hit a fire extinguisher before take-off in Salerno, Italy, causing £24,000 worth of damage to the small commercial aircraft on June 23, 2013. He said the pilot with Blink Ltd failed to inform maintenance staff of the crash and took off just minutes later. Capt Horrocks also flew from France to Blink Ltd's base in Surrey with an over-fuelled plane and failed to report the error correctly, Capt Howard claimed. He reported the incidents to management and called for Capt Horrocks to be dismissed, but he was allowed to continue flying. Capt Howard then reported the incidents to friend and Civil Aviation Authority official, Frank Zubiel and claimed that he was sacked by Blink Ltd director, Cameron Ogden, for bringing an ‘unwelcome focus’ on the company, which was founded in 2008. Cameron Ogden is a co-founder and Managing Director of Blink and is the son of IT giant Computacenter founder Sir Peter Ogden . Employment judge Robert Salter agreed that Capt Howard speaking to Mr Zubiel counted as a public interest disclosure but dismissed Capt Howard's claims today. Giving his judgement, he said: ‘The respondent argued that it terminated [Capt Howard's] contract not because he had made a protected disclosure but because of the manner in which he appeared to enlist Frank Zubiel in the removal of Captain Horrocks. ‘The tribunal is satisfied that the protected disclosures did not materially affect the decision to terminate the contract. ‘Mr Ogden believed that the claimant's conduct was serious and affected the reputation of the respondent, thereby entitling the respondent to terminate the contact without notice.’ Capt Howard, from Crowthorne, Berks, had earned £45,000 per year for three days’ work per week and was later employed as chief training captain and chief pilot at Blink Ltd., based at the small Blackbushe airfield in Camberley, Surrey. He later agreed to work for the company as a contractor through his own company, ATH Training, for £400 per day. Mr Ogden, the son of IT giant Computacenter founder Sir Peter Ogden, said had concerns about Capt Howard's erratic attendance, refusal to retrain Capt Horrocks following his overweight landing, and him drinking alcohol on company premises. Judge Salter added: ‘The respondent has shown that the reason for the detriment was not the protected disclosure and the claims made by the claimant are not well founded and are dismissed.’ Capt Howard said he felt the decision was ‘perverse’ and would be discussing the matter with his legal team, but added that he would not be appealing the decision. ‘I had a position which I felt I needed to defend and in the main I have been vindicated,’ he said. ‘I won't be getting any compensation but I have lost on a technicality really.' He said that the tribunal had cost him £25,000 in legal fees.","Captain Graham Howard, 63, has 35 years' flying experience .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Angi Fiege believes that her beautiful 19-year-old daughter, Rachael, would have been alive today had her friends bothered to call for help after she fell down the stairs during an alcohol-fuelled party last summer. Speaking to seniors at her daughter's high school this week, Angi Fiege said Rachael's college friends at Indiana University looked out for her, 'but they looked out for her the wrong way.' The 19-year-old college freshman passed away last August from a severe head injury a week before she was to start school. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Rachael Fiege, 19, moved to . Indiana University in August 2013 and was set to start class in a week when she sustained a head injury during a house party where alcohol was served and died . Off-campus: This is the house, just a block from the edge of the Indiana University campus, where Miss Fiege fell down a flight of basement stairs and died . Rachael Fiege was likely drinking at an off-campus event when she slipped and fell down a flight of stairs. Other party-goers thought the girl was drunk and left her to sleep it off on a sofa, but she never woke up. By the time paramedics were called more than six hours later, the teenager's heart had stopped. 'I know she'd be alive if they called 911,' Mrs Fiege said, referring to her daughter's friends, according to Indianapolis Star. Nine months after the tragedy, Angi Fiege is speaking out for the first time about her daughter's passing. The married mother of two, who works as an ER doctor in Indianapolis, recalled the terrible moment she got the call about Rachael and rushed to the hospital. ‘I saw my baby lying on the bed, on the ventilator, unconscious, with all the signs of lifelessness, except for a pulse,’ she told the station WTHR. Mother's grief: Angi Fiege (left and right) is convinced that her her daughter's friends called 911 right away, the girl (right) would have been alive today . Regret: Rachael's best friend, Mary Baluyut, says she left the August 2013 party 15 minutes before the teen's deadly accident . Rachael's best friend, Mary Baluyut, went to the fateful party with the freshman but left 15 minutes before her accident because she had an early meeting the following day. In retrospect, the young woman has come to regret her decision. ‘I really believe that had somebody recognized this was a serious event and called for help right away, my daughter would be here and we wouldn't be having this conversation,’ Angi Fiege said. In the aftermath of the girl's untimely death, Rachael's family and friends launched a new program called Rachael's First Week to educate high school seniors about some of the risks they might face in college. On Friday, Rachael's loved ones accompanied by IU emergency medicine residents met with 430 graduating seniors at Zionsvlle High School. ‘When you go out, you have to watch out for yourself,’ Ball State student Hanna Elliott, 19, told the high school kids in the audience. ‘You don't have your Zionsville bubble anymore. ‘Don't let us scare you. We want you guys to live it up, have fun — and be careful.’ Silver lining: The fiege family, Rachael's friends and medical residents teamed up to create Rachael's First Week program to educate high school seniors about the risks they would face in college . As part of the presentation, the seniors were shown a video featuring highlights from Rachael’s painfully short life set to Beyonce’s ‘I was here,’ followed by a Q & A session. Angi Fiege, Rachael’s friends on stage and many of the seniors in the crowd sobbed and wiped their eyes as the vivacious 19-year-old girl smiled at them on the screen. ‘Maybe highlighting what happened to Rachael, because she was so well-known, attaching a face and a name to those experiences will hopefully help prevent those tragedies that happened to my daughter,’ Mrs Fiege said. The overarching message that the team behind Rachael’s First Week wanted the seniors to take away from Friday’s event was: watch out for yourself, don't leave your friends behind and help one another. ‘Quite frankly, what happened to Rachael could happen to anybody. It was an accident,’ her mother pointed out. ‘They need to know what to do if they get into situations like this and not to be scared and to call for help, because seconds do count.’ Terrible choice: Miss Fiege was taken off life support by her parents, pictured, after a doctor told them that she was brain dead and would not recover from her injuries . The group used Friday’s program to promote Indiana's Lifeline Law, which provides immunity for minors who had been drinking if they seek medical help for a person suffering from an alcohol-related emergency. Angi said that while it is difficult to watch the presentation, she knows that it could potentially make the difference between life and death for some college freshman. The goal is to make sure Rachael's first week is never repeated. After the gathering, Zionsville seniors received a card with some helpful safety tips and a medallion honoring Rachael’s legacy. The Fiege family are planning to expand the initiative to schools across the state. At the time, police in Bloomington said Rachael Fiege fell down the basement stairs at an off-campus house and passed out sometime between 1 and 2am on August 24, 2013. Her fellow students helped her up, but did not call an ambulance until nearly 8am - seven hours later, because they didn't realize she was badly injured and thought she had just passed out. Fiege's tragic death came just two days after she arrived at Indiana University and before she had a chance to even attend her first class. Close friends: Miss Fiege's high school soccer teammates traveled to Bloomington for a chance to say goodbye to their friend before she was removed from life support . The campus newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student, reported that her parents took her off life support just hours later after doctors advised them that she was brain dead. Miss Fiege, who hoped to be a nurse, moved on campus August 21. The following night, she attended a boozy party at a house just one block from the edge of campus. After she tumbled down the stairs in the basement of the home, students helped her up and had her lay down in a different part of the house about 2am. 'The thought initially was probably that the injury was not as serious as it was,' IU Police Chief Laury Flint told the Daily Student at the time. It was not until 7.45am Miss Fiege's fellow students realized she would not wake up and called authorities. 13 WTHR Indianapolis .","Rachael Fiege, 19, was due to start class at Indiana University last August, but died after taking a spill at off-campus party .

"By . Lillian Radulova . A symbol of the Australian outback and a traditional shield against the harsh beating sun, the Akubra hat has been Australian made and owned for more than 130 years. But as Australia’s rabbit numbers continue to shrink and domestic suppliers dwindle, the brand has been forced to import 65-70 per cent of its materials from sources overseas - predominately Ukraine. Each hat is made from about 12 rabbit skins, an easy feat back in the early 20th century for the factory based in Kempsey, NSW, when rabbits plagued the countryside. Iconic: The Akubra hat is a symbol of the Australian outback and has recently seen huge demand from China and also Tibet . With rabbit skins used to make the hats, as the animals' numbers have steadily decline in Australia, Akubra has had to find overseas suppliers, including Ukraine . Akubra's Managing director Stephen Keir, told the ABC that the iconic brand had a long and proud history. 'Rabbit fur is the best fur to make our hats out of, and the rabbit industry in the '40s and '50s was absolutely enormous, wild rabbits that is, there was no farmed rabbits in those days,' Mr Keir said. 'It started off in Tasmania as a fur-cutting business and we moved up to Sydney and started making hats. My great-grandfather married the boss's daughter and generations later I'm here now.' Still vastly popular from its onset, Akubra hats still sell like wild fire with the biggest buyers outside of the consistent rural community including the Australian Defence Force with which the company holds a five-year contract. But the biggest and most recent fan of the Australian hats is China, which Mr Keir described as 'going gangbusters' with the product. Akubra started in Tasmania and eventually moved to Sydney. Today, its factory is located in Kempsey, on NSW north coast . He said Tibet was expected to buy about 12,000 hats from the little company this year alone, easily becoming Akubra's biggest importer. But producing the hats has become more and more problematic over the last decade due to the great success of the Calicivirus. Introduced to rabbits in the 1990s to control the pest's numbers and protect native wildlife, the solution has reduced rabbit numbers by about 90 per cent. Consequently, rabbit farms have dwindled as vaccines for farmers prove expensive, with three large companies closing in the last year or so. Mr Keir is left with no choice but to look towards overseas suppliers for his company, with his biggest source coming from Ukraine. 'We just can't get it here. And what we can get is expensive and not of very good quality so we have to supplement that with stuff from overseas. Basically I can import fur from France and put it on a plane and have it here within a week.' Despite the challenges, Mr Keir confirmed the production process will remain in Australia.","130-year-old company thrived off the rabbit plague in the early 20th century .

Australia's highest piece of residential real estate has never been lived in, and boasting a lush interior and 360-degree views of the Victorian capital . It's not just the exterior that's impressive. Potential owners of the penthouse, that has never been lived in before, will be greeted by a closed-off marble lobby as soon as they step out of the elevator. It also boasts floor-to-ceiling windows, and four bedrooms with large his-and-hers dressing rooms.

"By . Associated Press . Prosecutors charged Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay with two misdemeanor counts Friday stemming from his intoxicated driving arrest near his home in March. Hamilton County prosecutors said Irsay was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and operating a vehicle with a schedule I or II controlled substance or its metabolite in the body, which carry maximum penalties of 60 days in jail and $500 fines for each count. A probable cause affidavit said Irsay was driving under the influence of oxycodone and/or hydrocodone, both powerful painkillers. Charged: Colts owner Jim Irsay is seen in this March booking photo . Arrested: Irsay, seen in this file photo, was arrested near his home at about 3 a.m. on March 16 with $29,000 in cash and bottles of prescription drugs in his vehicle . Irsay was arrested near his home at about 3 a.m. on March 16 with $29,000 in cash and bottles of prescription drugs in his vehicle. Police said Irsay denied being drunk and told an officer he had taken several prescription medications during the day. A police report said the 54-year-old billionaire was so disoriented that officers made him sit on the hood of a patrol car to keep him from falling, and that he had trouble reciting the alphabet. Police had filed four preliminary felony counts of possession of a controlled substance, charges that each carried possible sentences of six months to three years in prison. Prosecutors took weeks before deciding to file the misdemeanor charges instead. The Indianapolis law office representing Irsay, Voyles, Zahn & Paul, released a statement thanking the prosecutor's office for its professionalism in handing the investigation and 'for devoting the necessary care and attention to determine the facts in this matter did not warrant the filing of felony charges relative to Mr. Irsay's prescription medications.' Colts spokesman Avis Roper declined immediate comment. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the league is still reviewing the matter. 'The NFL's Personal Conduct Policy applies to all league personnel and holds all of us accountable. We are reviewing the matter and will take appropriate action in accordance with the policy,' he said in an email. Irsay, seen in this 2010 file photo, has a hearing scheduled for June 19. acknowledged in 2002 that he had become dependent on painkillers after several years of orthopedic operations but said he had overcome the problem . When he was arrested, Irsay - seen in this 2012 file photo with Edgerrin James - reportedly stumbled out of his SUV and failed field sobriety tests . There are few examples of the league punishing an owner like Irsay. Detroit Lions president Tom Lewand was suspended for 30 days and fined $100,000 in 2010 for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy following his guilty plea to driving while impaired. The police report said Irsay stumbled out of his SUV and failed field sobriety tests. After Irsay refused a blood draw, a judge approved a search warrant to draw his blood. Refusing the blood test means Irsay's driver's license will be automatically suspended for one year. An initial hearing is scheduled for June 19. Irsay was supposed to have an initial hearing on March 25, but that hearing was postponed because he had been admitted to an out-of-state medical facility for inpatient treatment, the prosecutor's office said. His family said at the time he was undergoing treatment 'to help him meet his challenges head-on.' Irsay acknowledged in 2002 that he had become dependent on painkillers after several years of orthopedic operations but said he had overcome the problem. Irsay resumed his duties with the Colts at the NFL draft earlier this month and earlier this week he made the unsuccessful personal pitch to his fellow owners on behalf of Indianapolis' bid to host the 2018 Super Bowl. Irsay became the Colts owner in 1997 after the death of his father, Robert Irsay, and a lengthy legal battle with his father's second wife. Forbes magazine has estimated Irsay's net worth at $1.6 billion. He has helped build the Colts into a top NFL team over the past decade behind quarterback Peyton Manning, now with Denver, and was a key player in the drive to bring the Super Bowl to Indianapolis two years ago. He is working with some success to rebuild the team behind young quarterback Andrew Luck while coping with a divorce that follows a decade-long separation from his wife of 33 years.","Prosecutors charged Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay, 54,  with two misdemeanor counts Friday .

"By . Sarah Dean . and Australian Associated Press . The impartiality of the Speaker of the House of Representatives has been called into question after Bronwyn Bishop was accused of hosting Liberal Party fundraisers in her Parliament House Speaker's suite, in Canberra. Mrs Bishop, who has been a member of the Liberal Party since the age of 17, has reportedly been taking advantage of the plush room to host functions, while Labor office holders say they never used the room in such a way. However, a spokesman for the Australian politician claimed there was nothing illegal about the practice and reassured taxpayers that the government is not coughing up the bill for any soirees. Under fire: Bronwyn Bishop has been accused of hosting Liberal Party fundraisers in her Parliament House Speaker's suite in Canberra . 'From time to time the Speaker holds private functions in Parliament House as does a large number of members and senators... the cost is charged to her private account,' they told the Sydney Morning Herald. Mrs Bishop, 71, reportedly hosted a Liberal Party fundraising event in her suite on the night of the May 13 budget. The Sunday Telegraph claims the dinner was attended by 20 Liberal donors and cost $50,000. Diners were reportedly charged $2,500 a plate and Prime Minister Tony Abbott is also thought to have attended the party. Labor says if the claim is proven, Mrs Bishop should stand down. 'If this is true, her position as Speaker is no longer tenable,' manager of opposition business Tony Burke told AAP in a statement. Party venue?

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A man who was caught with thousands of photographs of child pornography kept his stash of sick pictures hidden in a secret room. Kenneth E. Smith, from Vancouver, had been collecting child porn for 12 years when the FBI visited him last July, but he went to extreme efforts to prevent his obsession from being uncovered. His computer on which the graphic images were stored was kept on the second floor of an outbuilding on his property. Kenneth Smith's computer: The PC was found to store more than 8,000 pornographic images. It also controlled the sprinkler system to water his stash of marijuana plants . To get there, investigators had to open a hidden elevator; the operating switch of which, was disguised as a glue can. Smith had been caught sharing child pornography online and subsequently found to have thousands of images showing toddlers and older children being sexually abused. His hidden computer was kept in a room full of marijuana plants. The PC was disguised and used to control a sprinkler system to grow the plants and also store the illegal pictures. Smith pleaded guilty to possession and distribution of child pornography. Going down for years: A secret elevator led to to Kenneth Smith's marijuana growing and child porn computer room . He will now be heading to prison today for the next eight years. Federal prosecutors noted how Smith failed a lie detector test when asked whether he personally sexually abused children. He also refused to undergo a more thorough examination of his sexual history following his guilty plea. Trying to downplay the allegations, Smith claimed he’d downloaded photos of older children after being distraught following a breakup. Investigators found more than 8,000 files showing children of all ages being raped and abused. Potted pot: Kenneth Smith's marijuana was grown in a secret room reachable only via an elevator that was operated by use of a secret switch . 'Smith’s actions contributed to the demand for these horrific images of child abuse,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Marci Ellsworth said in court papers. 'Every participant in the chain – producer, distributor, consumer – sustains the market for these images, and each victim, whether identified or not, suffers not only when an image of him or her is created, but each and every time an image of him or her is viewed.'","Kenneth E.

"By . Louise Cheer . A couple whose teenage son drowned during a school excursion were awarded just a fraction of the $100 million they were seeking because the judge ruled the father was not a 'witness of truth'. Almost half-a-million dollars will be paid by the Presbyterian Church to the Chainas after Nathan Chaina died on a trip organised by a prestigious Sydney school. The Scot's College student drowned during a hike at the school's Glengarry campus in the Kangaroo Valley in 1999. The 15-year-old's family sued the eastern Sydney school's operator, the Presbyterian Church Property Trust. Scroll down for video . Nathan Chaina pictured with his father, George, was found 24 hours after he drowned on a The Scot's College excursion in Yurrunga Creek . On Friday, the NSW Supreme Court ordered the trust to pay the Chainas $492,373 in compensation. But this was only a fraction of the $100 million the family wanted. Nathan's parents, George and Rita Chaina claimed their companies - Proton Technology Pty Ltd and Deluxe Chemicals Pty Ltd - had suffered because of the trauma they had experienced after their son's death. The Sydney Morning Herald reports Justice Davies said the mental harm the pair had gone through had disintegrated by 2011. He said the couple's failure to engage in the relaunch of their companies' products was not the school's fault. Justice Davies went on to say Mr Chaina was not a 'witness of truth' and had not given consistent replies during evidence. '(Mr Chaina) had a fixed and almost delusional view about himself, his own abilities and expertise and about the success and reputation of his companies, in the face of strong evidence to the contrary,' he said. 'He said whatever he believed would help him to win this case and obtain very substantial damages. 'This was at least partly motivated by his desire for vengeance.' Nathan Chaina's (left) sued the school's operator, the Presbyterian Church Property Trust, and won almost $500,000 in compensation . Initially Mr Chaina said in 2005 he had a Bachelor of Science from UNSW along with completing a business and marketing course. But it was later revealed he had been making it up for about 40 years as well as the claim that he had been head-hunted to work at Procter and Gamble in New York. 'We are trying to do the right thing by the public, and that's why we did it - so it doesn't happen again,' Mr Chaina said after the hearing. Justice David Davies is set to make make another ruling about the possibility of paying interest as well as the compensation, as well as who will pay the costs of the case. The family, from Vaucluse, said they spent more than $20 million on the case last year. '[Nathan's] death is primarily attributable to the school overlooking ordinary aspects of human nature, together with a lack of risk management and safety procedures' - Deputy Coroner Jan Stevenson . The state's Deputy Coroner Jan Stevenson previously ruled The Scots College was to blame for the tragedy. The college commands fees worth tens of thousands of dollars. '[Nathan's] death is primarily attributable to the school overlooking ordinary aspects of human nature together with a lack of risk management and safety procedures,' Ms Stevenson said in 2001. The teenager was reported missing for about 15 hours before his body was found in Yurrunga Creek in Kangaroo Valley. It was 24 hours after he fell into the water when crossing the creek. Nathan was separated from the excursion group because of heavy flooding.","Nathan Chaina's family were seeking $100 million in compensation .

"By . Louise Cheer . Job seekers on unemployment benefits have no right to reject work just because they can't find their dream jobs, Prime Minister Tony Abbott says. From 2015, thousands of unemployed people under 30 will be forced to work for their welfare payments as part of the government's new budget measures. They will have to wait at least six months before receiving their first payment. Mr Abbott said job seekers should be taking any job that is offered rather than being on welfare. 'People have no right to hold out for the job of their dreams while they are on unemployment benefits,' he told journalists in Adelaide on Saturday. Prime Minister Tony Abbott says those on welfare benefits should take any job that is offered to them instead of waiting for their dream job . He said: 'Frankly, that is the least that people should be prepared to do under those circumstances.' Welfare groups have warned the tough earn-or-learn measures could result in young people taking up petty crime or ending up on the streets. Mr Abbott also said on Saturday he would not bow to pressure and compromise over the budget's unpopular measures. The leader was again defending the tough line the Federal Government has taken to curb the nation's debt after this week's student protests opposing university deregulation measures. Earlier this month, Treasurer Joe Hockey handed power back to universities to set their own tuition costs in his first budget. Mr Abbott said he would not surrender his budget in the wake of public backlash to compromise over its the most unpopular measures. The Prime Minister said he was confident the Senate would approve the coalition's budget because the alternative would be a double dissolution election. His comments come after senior government ministers indicated they might compromise on some key reforms, such as higher education interest rates and the GP co-payment, after fierce public backlash and a hostile Senate. Education Minister Christopher Pyne said he would be willing to compromise on the tough measures despite Mr Abbott saying his party would not cave to pressure . He said his cabinet 'absolutely' understood the 'iron necessity' of sticking with the difficult budget measures. But, after facing a slew of student protests, Education Minister Christopher Pyne said he was open to compromising on some reforms. He said the rethink was because the government did not have a majority in the upper house. 'We will of course seek to consult and negotiate with the minor parties and the crossbenches to ensure these important reforms are delivered,' Mr Pyne said in a statement. And Mr Abbott concedes that negotiations were inevitable. He said: 'You have got to negotiate your legislation through the parliament. 'Because let's face it, there have been many governments over many years that have had to negotiate budgets through the Senate.' Opposition spokesman Tony Burke said the government would vet any changes to the budget measures through parliamentary process in the same way they have done with current ones . Last week, it seemed Mr Abbott had cooled on the idea of a double dissolution election after early indications revealed incoming Senate crossbenchers were unlikely to keep their seats if a new election was called. The Opposition as well as the Greens and Palmer United Party have vowed they will not support critical changes, including the Medicare co-payment and pension cuts. Industry groups are also being consulted in the process to 'refine the details' of the changes, including two tertiary education stakeholder groups. Opposition finance spokesman Tony Burke said the government's willingness to compromise showed it was in disarray and its budget was unravelling. Mr Burke said Labor would apply the same 'tests' to vote down any measures changed in the parliamentary process - in the way it is opposing changes affecting pensioners, university students, Medicare, and fuel and cost-of-living prices. The Australian Medical Association is set to hold urgent talks with Health Minister Peter Dutton to seek a compromise on all medical co-payments flagged in the budget. The association passed a vote at its national conference on Saturday to push to have the payment targeted at higher-income earners. They fear co-payments will negatively impact on vulnerable groups and add pressure on hospitals. President Steve Hambleton said in a statement the association was 'well-positioned' to assist the government come up with 'a fairer and more equitable model'.","Prime Minister's comments come after government's hardline on welfare .

Spencer Smith, a history teacher at Heritage High School in Brentwood, California, has courted controversy by posing as Trayvon Martin in the school's yearbook . Alfreda Charway, the high school's Black Student Union President, said it was ‘a good idea because he's expressing himself.’ ‘Because that's the whole point of yearbook pictures, you're supposed to express yourself,’ Charway told KTVU. Sophomore Amber McKim thought it was ‘okey that he did it, just not in the yearbook.’ ‘I think he can do it at his house or on his Facebook. But not in the yearbook,’ she said. Parents, however, thought it was ‘inappropriate.’ Spencer Smith is a senior history teacher at Heritage High School in Brentwood, California . Trayvon Martin was tragically gunned down by neighborhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman in 2012 . One mom, who didn't want to be named, said: ‘I think that's very inappropriate for a yearbook. This is supposed to be capturing the best moments of the year. And all positive things.’ 'I think you could take it different ways, but I think a high school yearbook as a teacher is not the place to make your stance,' said parent Michelle Alameda.

Surveillance footage has revealed the terrifying moment three children suffered electric shocks after they touched a metal railing in a swimming pool at a Florida apartment complex. Diego Cabrera, 10, Daniella Gamez, six, and a five-year-old girl were swimming with friends and adults at the Palms West Condos in Hialeah on April 27 when the incident occurred. The video shows several people swimming in the shallow end of the pool when one girl swims over to the metal rail, which inspectors believe was charged with electricity due to a faulty pool pump. Scroll down for video . Terrifying: A video shows a young girl in the water after she touched a metal rail that gave her a shock . Saved: A man pulls her limp body out of the water as other children scramble to escape the danger . When she touches it, she falls limp in the water. A nearby adult quickly pulls her out and carries her up the stairs, the video on Local 10 ABC shows. As everyone scrambles to get out of the pool, they don't realize that Daniella had also been paralyzed by the shock and remained frozen in the water. Her grandfather, Freddie Cabrera, then sees her at the bottom of the steps and - risking his own life - runs into the water and pulls her out, falling backwards as drags her body. A third child, Diego Cabrera, also needed to be saved from the water. Frantic: Moments later, a man sees his six-year-old granddaughter paralyzed in the water and runs to over .

'I was in the pool and then the metal railing, I was swimming close to it and I felt a shock,' he told Local 10. All three victims spent four nights in the hospital but have fully recovered. Inspectors say that the pool pump had not been properly grounded and malfunctioned - sending electricity into the water rather than away from it. They said that the electrical work that had been carried out was unpermitted. The pool has now been drained and remains closed.

The distance the charity trio are walking was chosen to tie-in with the year England won the World Cup - 1966. Pete Johnston, 29, Adam Burns, 27 and David Bewick, 31, started their 96-day journey in Mendoza, on March 3, planning to reach Porto Alegre by June 12 when the competition starts. Game on: Pete Johnston, 29, Adam Burns, 27, David Bewick, 31, and a travelling companion they picked up along the way (left), with dog Jefferson Ramsey Moore . Keep on trekking: The football fans will have walked 1,221 miles when they reach Porto Alegre . The charity trio have walked 870 miles (1,400km) in just 67 days. The group has been swelled by a stray dog – who joined them on their journey in Uruguay. The black labrador - now dubbed Jefferson Ramsey Moore after the group’s favourite England players - started following the group in Uruguay and shows no sign of leaving the team before they reach the World Cup. Historic link: The distance the charity trio are walking - 1,966km - was chosen to tie-in with the year England won the World Cup . The loyal lab has been dogging the group for 220miles (350km) and has been given his own England shirt from the 1998 tournament. They have named the dog after 1966 heroes Sir Alf Ramsey and Bobby Moore. Adam said: ‘Jefferson began following us in the small town of Solis on the Uruguayan coast and at first we tried to get rid of him because he smelt like road kill. ‘When he was still there at the end of the day as we set up camp we refrained from feeding him as we knew that would make him continue to follow us and we didn't want to take him away from where he was from. No mean feet: The charity trio have walked 870 miles (1,400km) in just 67 days . ‘When we woke up the next day he was still there so we decided he was not in it for the food, he just wanted companionship. ‘That was three weeks ago and now he is a key part of the Walk to the World Cup team, we even modified a World Cup 98 shirt for him which he wears with pride.’ Jefferson has now covered more than 280 miles and the group managed to get him over the border into Brazil. The boys hope to re-home their new best friend when they have completed the final 400 miles of their journey.

I also haven't ruled out taking him back to Sydney with me, but according to a vet we spoke to he might be too old to fly.

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Associated Press Reporter . A Las Vegas man has pleaded guilty but mentally insane to hacking a 4-month-old baby in a stroller to death with a medieval-style battle ax and critically wounding the child's mother in 2010. Harold Eugene Montague's public defense lawyer, Norm Reed, said his client plans to apologize and explain his delusions when he is sentenced to a life in prison July 30 in order to bring some closure to the victims, neighbors and first-responders traumatized by the shocking attack. 'It will be important for everyone involved to hear Harold's account,' Reed told The Associated Press. 'The story he tells is a delusional story. It's been gut-wrenching for everybody.' Closure: Harold Montague, 38, pleaded guilty but mentally insane Thursday to hacking a 4-month-old baby in a stroller to death and . critically wounding the child's mother in a sidewalk attack four years ago . Montague, 38, pleaded guilty Thursday in Clark County District Court to first-degree murder with a deadly weapon, two counts of attempted murder and battery on a police officer. The plea deal with prosecutors means Montague will not be put on trial or face the death penalty, but will be imprisoned for the rest of his days with no chance of parole. 'Nobody would be comfortable with Harold getting out of prison,' Reed said, 'but I don't think executing him is appropriate either. That's why we came to this conclusion.' The plea deal also means that Sandra Lisset Castro will not have to testify again about hearing her attacker laugh and mock her as she begged him to stop attacking her and her child, Damian Avila Castro. Castro testified at a preliminary hearing in April 2010 that her face was split open and her jaw had to be surgically reattached after the February 2010 attack. She said her right eye was irreparably damaged. Her son's overturned stroller was left next to a bloody stain in the street. Survivor: Sandra Castro testified at a preliminary hearing in April 2010 that her face was split open with Montague's hatchet and her jaw had to be surgically reattached . Montague also stabbed his profoundly disabled sister-in-law, Monica O'Dazier, some 20 times inside their home before bursting outside and attacking Castro and her son, police said. O'Dazier was treated for her injuries and survived. A neighbor who witnessed the attack, dialed 911 and helped Castro once police subdued Montague, testified through tears that the incident caused her to suffer an emotional breakdown. She said she spent seven days in psychiatric care. On the emergency call, which was . played in court, the neighbor is heard shrieking, 'Oh my God! Her face . is split open where he hit her with the hatchet!' Montague told police he had no memory of the attacks. His wife, Erricca Montague, testified that the attack weapon used to hang on the wall of their home. Archaic weapon: Police say Montague used a medieval-style battle ax (similar to one pictured) in the attack . She said her husband sometimes smoked marijuana but didn't take other drugs and never drank alcohol. She testified she hadn't felt her husband was a danger to her, their three children or her disabled sister. But he also hadn't been eating and spent several sleepless nights pacing the floor before the attack. Reed and defense lawyer Andrea Luem never sought a mental evaluation or challenged Montague's fitness for trial. 'Competency and mental illness are two different things,' Reed said. 'He understands the charges against him and is able to aid in his defense. With Harold it's mental illness.' 'It would be impossible for us to say Harold would be fine if he was released,' the defense attorney said. Police say just before noon on February 11, 2010, Sandra Castro was pushing her son, Damian, in a stroller near the intersection of Sahara Avenue and Maryland Parkway when Harold Montague stormed out of his one-story house at 1609 San Pedro Avenue and attacked the mother and son with a hatchet. The infant was killed on the spot with a blow to the head, while his mother was gravely wounded. Montague did not know the family. When police entered Montague’s home, the ax-wielding man lunged at one of the responding officers, causing him minor injuries. When investigators searched the dwelling, they came upon Montague's disabled sister-in-law suffering from at least 20 stab wounds. According to police, the man attacked Monica O’Dazier, who had been in his care for six years, in the presence of his two small children before bursting out into the street and hacking Sandra Castro and her son. Following his arrest, Montague told police he had no memory of the incident. During a court appearance in April 2010, a severely scarred Ms Castro described the horrific attack through a translator. 'My face and my head. Those are the parts of my body where he was striking me,' she said. 'I was saying in English, ""Please, please leave me alone!"" But he wouldn't listen to me. 'Every time he would hit me, he would laugh out loud. I was begging him to let me go, and he was mocking me.'","Harold Montague, 38, will get life sentence for murdering 4-month-old Damian Castro and injuring his mother in February 2010 Las Vegas attack .

"By . Emily Crane . John William Goodwin, 41, was convicted of breaking into 38 homes and filming 62 women and children over seven years in Brisbane . A 'peeping Tom' who broke into Brisbane homes to film himself next to sleeping women and children has been jailed for at least eight years. John William Goodwin, 41, was convicted of breaking into 38 homes and filming 62 women and children over seven years until September 2012. He filmed his victims, aged eight to 50, while they were sleeping, on the toilet and as they undressed, Brisbane District Court was told on Friday. Crown prosecutor Michael Byrne said Goodwin's actions were predatory and were made worse because the women did not know they were being filmed, the Courier Mail reports. Goodwin's predatory side was discovered after police traced child pornography featuring an eight-year-old victim being sold to a Russian website. Police found a computer cache of 1.5 million files that Goodwin had created including 154,000 child exploitation photos, 1,193 child exploitation videos and a number of 'peeping Tom' files. His victims lived in homes up to 2km away and videos showed him climbing up trees, fences, pergolas and gates to film the female targets whose names he spent time researching. The court was told Goodwin also sexually assaulted some of his victims and filmed himself pulling at their blankets and touching them as they slept. The films sometimes showed Goodwin performing a sexual act on himself. His barrister Damien Carlton tried to justify Goodwin's behaviour by saying he was offending for his own 'voyeuristic sexual gratification' that started when he was young. Detective Inspector John Rouse said outside court that Goodwin's sentencing marked the end of a long and challenging police investigation. 'I can't imagine that any member of the public, if they had viewed some of the images and videos that we saw, would not be alarmed about the invasions of privacy that have occurred here, in the sanctity of their own homes,' he said.","John William Goodwin filmed 62 women and children over seven years .

"By . Emily Crane . A group of Northern Territory cooks are rivalling the French's renowned frog legs by coming up with their own delicacy – the poisonous cane toad. The cooks have started using the legs of the pest species in six different dishes and are dubbing it the 'new feral fine food'. Darwin food blogger Emma Lupin said the cane toad was overlooked as a food source. Darwin food blogger Emma Lupin has started using the poisonous cane toad in her cooking . 'There are just so many cane toads it is mind boggling, but they are also surprisingly easy to catch,' Ms Lupin, who is part of the GULP NT blog, said. 'The most humane way reported is to catch them by the back legs and whip them into a dark airtight canoe bag, you don't want to stress them out.' Ms Lupin's blog – Growing and Understanding Local Produce – is part of a community project that focuses on using locally grown foods. The GULP team are the ones behind the cane toad leg recipes. The cane toads are killed by freezing them before cutting off their legs . The legs of the cane toad are then skinned to rid it of its poisonous skin . Ms Lupin has experimented with a number of recipes including marinating the toad legs in soy, garlic, ginger and chilli . INGREDIENTS . 8 toads legs with skins removed . 2 tbls butter . 3 cloves of garlic . Salt and Pepper to taste . 1 baguette . Garlic chives, finely chopped . METHOD . 1. Melt butter in a heavy based sauce pan and fry garlic until softened . 2. Add toad legs and cook in butter until tender . 3. Lightly toast the baguette . 4. Serve two toad legs on a piece of baguette . 5. Drizzle with garlic butter and garnished with chives . 'I tried marinating them in soy, garlic, ginger and chilli. After a couple of hours in the fridge I sautéed them in sesame oil and served them with heaps of local Vietnamese coriander and random salad greens, including sweet leaf and rosella leaves,' Ms Lupin said. Cane toads produce poison through its parotid gland and some parts of its body are poisonous for many species including humans. Ms Lupin said the way cane toads are killed is important because they disperse more poison when stressed. 'So give them the most calm end possible,' she said. 'After you have a few pop them in the freezer. After sufficiently frozen thaw these guys out… (and) with a meat cleaver or sharp knife cut off their legs. 'Because of the fact these creatures contain poison in their back and skin, you want to skin them and avoid the upper body. We skinned the legs which is really easy.' The group experimented with cooking road kill like snakes and wallabies before turning to cane toads. 'If you are going to try some pest management, you might as well get some protein from this unwanted visitor,' Ms Lupin said.

"By . Louise Cheer . Australia is the 18th happiest country in the world, according to a global survey. The nation scored a 79 out of 100 on Gallup's Positive Experience Index, which involved about 1000 people aged 15 years and over from 138 countries. It lagged behind the list's top five - Paraguay, Panama, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Ecuador. Australia came just behind New Zealand, ranked 17th, in the happiness stakes in a global Gallup survey . But Australia's level of positivity was higher than most of the world. The global happiness score was 71. This meant at least seven in 10 people across the globe were experiencing lots of enjoyment, laughing or smiling a lot, feeling well-rested, and being treated with respect. Our neighbour across the ditch, New Zealand, was ranked just one spot higher in 17th place. The report also found more than 51 per cent of people had learned or did something interesting the day before. For a third year in a row, Paraguay topped the happiness stakes - this year with a score of 87. Out of the top 10 countries, nine were South American. Paraguay topped the list for the third year in a row and was one of the nine South American countries who made the top 10 . The report credited the culture of the countries as a major contributor to their joy. 'That so many people are reporting positive emotions in Latin America at least partly reflects the cultural tendency in the region to focus on the positives in life,' it said. Unsurprisingly emotional highs are at a low point in Syria, with the country falling to the bottom of the list for the second year in a row. It scored 36 out of 100 on the happiness scale - an all-time low for any nation Gallup has measured. 'Fewer than one in three Syrians report feeling well-rested (31%), feeling enjoyment (31%), or learning or doing something interesting (25%) the day before,' the report said. The Gallup report also found people with more money were happier. In 2013, when the survey was done, there was a 10 percentage point gap between the highest and lowest income brackets. But previous US research showed higher incomes only up to $75,000 had a positive impact on happiness. Past that point, it made much less of a difference.","The nation scored a happiness factor of 79 out of 100 in a Gallup survey .

"By . Louise Cheer . Discounted boob jobs will be offered on the Gold Coast to compete against the increase in patients heading to Asia for cut-price surgery. In an Australian first, a cosmetic tourism agency based in Queensland's Broadbeach is teaming up with respected plastic surgeons to offer cheaper procedures. CosMediTour, along with Dr Craig Layt and Dr Luke Stradwick, are offering boob job holidays for about $7900. Gold Coast girls Natalie Kernke, Anna Thomsen and Noi Aasen have all travelled to Thailand to get their boob jobs through CosMediTour . The agency the girls travelled through is now offering discounted boob jobs on the Gold Coast . For those who just want the procedure done, it's $6880 - including an anaesthetist and the hospital stay. Through the new Gold Coast Breast Academy, the two doctors will train plastic surgeons for standard breast implants that can be offered at a cheaper price. Breast implants with a plastic surgeon cost $10,000 on average in Australia compared to $4000 in Thailand. A Surfers Paradise or Broadbeach boob job holiday includes a nine-night stay, day surgery at Southport’s Pacific Private Hospital and a follow-up appointment six days after the surgery. About 100 patients a month travel through CosMediTour a year to get cosmetic surgery in Thailand . There is also an option to upgrade to have a nurse monitor patients on the first night. And there is already interest coming from New Zealand and Perth, just days after the package went on offer. ‘There are people who don’t want to go to Thailand or are not comfortable to have surgery off-shore,' CosMediTour managing director Greg Lemon said. 'We don’t send anyone to plastic surgeons in Thailand...and we wanted to offer people the option of using plastic surgeons here. 'You can get cut price boob jobs in Australia, but not with plastic surgeons.' About 80 per cent of the people sent over every month by the agency are getting boob jobs . In Australia, a plastic surgeon has to be accepted into the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and study an extra five years to become qualified, where as a cosmetic doctor does not. CosMediTour currently sends about 100 patients every month jet to Bangkok or Phuket, with 80 per cent of them having breast implants. But there is a catch to getting discount breasts. The cheaper price is for implants up to 400ml and patients have to meet certain criteria. Mr Lemon said the procedure would be ideal for women with no sagging breasts or asymmetry because they would need different surgery. Gold Coast resident Anna Thomsen, who had a boob job in Bangkok, welcomed the discounted procedure to Australian shores. 'I think it’s a great idea having it on the Gold Coast because some people would be terrified of the idea of going to Thailand so it makes it a bit more convenient,' she said. CosMediTour is offering boob job holidays for $7900 in Surfers Paradise or Broadbeach. A boob job alone is $4000 in Thailand . According to Phuket International Hospital’s Peter Davison, there is a market for cheaper breast implants in Australia. He said out of 2000 cosmetic surgery cases a year 1600 were Australians, with 30 per cent from Queensland and that trend is growing. Mr Davison said the hospital was seeing a 30 per cent growth in numbers every year. Respected surgeons Dr Craig Layt and Dr Luke Stradwick will train other doctors at the new Gold Coast Breast Academy to offer the cheaper procedures, using implants similar to those pictured above .","CosMediTour, based in Queensland, is offering cheaper boob jobs .

"By . Snejana Farberov . An Oklahoma woman accused of shooting dead her fiance whom she suspected of being unfaithful has been ordered to stand trial on a first-degree murder charge. Sandra Woodard has been charged in the killing of Harley Moody, 37, an Navy veteran and local radio host who was found mortally wounded in the their Lone Wolf, Oklahoma, home in early January. When interviewed by police after Moody's death, Woodard told officers that she accidentally shot her husband-to-be during a sexual role-playing game. Scroll down for video . Bad romance: Sandra Woodard (left) is facing a murder trial for shooting dead her fiance, Harley Moody (right) in January . Her version: Woodard, pictured in jail garb on her way to a preliminary hearing, told police she shot Moody by accident during a sex game . But an investigation has uncovered gaping holes in Woodard's story, leading to her arrest nine days later. On Monday, Woodard dressed in orange-and-white jail garb appeared in court for her preliminary hearing. The prosecution called 10 witnesses to testify, among them several family members of the victim who all said that Woodard did not trust Moody and suspected him of infidelity, the station KSWO reported. Moody's sister-in-law Sherry Moody said from the stand that she and Woodard grew close, and the woman confided in her that she had created a fake Craigslist account hoping to catch her fiancé red-handed. Several months before the killing, Mrs Moody recalled how Woodard was leaving her house when she turned around and said: 'A friend of mine said that I should shoot him.' Sherry warned her that she should never speak like that, but Woodard allegedly doubled down, adding, 'I might just go kill him and plead the fifth.' Suspicions: Moody's sister-in-law testified that Woodard was convinced that her fiance was cheating on her . Radio personality: Moody, a father of six, worked as a DJ for KEYB Radio in Altus, Oklahoma . Concerned for her brother-in-law's safety, Sherry Moody called her mother and then the 37-year-old DJ, asking him if his fiancee had means to harm him. The man replied that his wife-to-be owned a gun. Afterwards, the father of six took his children and went to stay with his parents in Olustee. Sherry Moody testified that on another occasion, Woodard called her saying that she believed she had seen her fiance in a pornographic video on an X-rated website. Woodard asked her friend to take a look at the video to see if she recognized Harley Moody, but the sister-in-law refused to do it. Early signs of trouble: Months before the killing, Woodard allegedly told Moody's relative that a friend told her she should shoot him, and she added that she might kill him and 'plead the fifth' Double life: Woodard was convinced that her radio host fiance was secretly moonlighting as a porn star . On Monday, the court also heard from the victim’s supervisor at KEYB Radio who testified that one time, Woodard came in asking to use her fiance's computer while he was not there. The supervisor later discovered that Woodard used the computer to look for pornography because she was convinced that her fiance was an adult film star who employed software to obscure his face. Military man: Moody joined the U.S. Navy after high school and served in Operation Desert Storm . Just after 11pm on January 7, Sandra Woodard called 911 to report that she had accidentally shot Harley Moody, according to Altus Times. Officers who responded to the couple's home on East 1410 Road in Lone Wolf found the 37-year-old man bleeding heavily from multiple gunshot wounds inflicted with a semi-automatic pistol. The father of six was pronounced dead on the scene. Moody's obituary stated that the 37-year-old man joined the U.S. Navy after finishing high school and was a veteran of Operation Desert Storm. After leaving the military, he was hired by KEYB Radio in Atlus as a DJ. His many hobbies included singing and playing guitar, riding his motorcycle and working on old cars. Moody is survived by three daughters and three sons. Sandra Woodard was charged in the murder about a week after the killing.

"By . Mark Prigg . The Antarctic ice sheet is melting at its fastest rate in history, it has been revealed. Three years of observations from ESA’s CryoSat satellite show that the Antarctic ice sheet is now losing 159 billion tonnes of ice each year – twice as much as when it was last surveyed. The polar ice sheets are a major contributor to the rise in global sea levels, and these newly measured losses from Antarctica alone are enough to raise global sea levels by 0.45 mm each year. Scroll down for video . Three years of measurements from the European CryoSat show that the Antarctic Ice Sheet is now losing 159 billion tonnes of ice each year, enough to raise global sea levels by 0.45 mm per year. Launched in 2010, CryoSat carries a radar altimeter that can measure the surface height variation of ice in fine detail, allowing scientists to record changes in its volume with unprecedented accuracy. CryoSat surveys almost all – 96% – of the Antarctic continent, reaching to within 215 km of the South Pole. In addition, it has increased coverage over coastal regions, where today’s ice losses are concentrated. These latest findings by a team of scientists from the UK’s Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling show that the pattern of imbalance continues to be dominated by glaciers thinning in the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica. Between 2010 and 2013, West Antarctica, East Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula lost 134, 3 and 23 billion tonnes of ice each year, respectively. The average rate of ice thinning in West Antarctica has increased compared to previous measurements, and this area’s yearly loss is now one third more than measured over the five years before CryoSat’s launch. The data collected from 2010-2013 was compared to that from 2005-2010. 'We find that ice losses continue to be most pronounced along the fast-flowing ice streams of the Amundsen Sea sector, with thinning rates of 4-8 m per year near to the grounding lines – where the ice streams lift up off the land and begin to float out over the ocean – of the Pine Island, Thwaites and Smith Glaciers,' said Dr Malcolm McMillan from the University of Leeds, UK, and lead author of the study. This area has long been identified as the most vulnerable to changes in climate. Recent assessments say its glaciers may have passed a point of irreversible retreat.

CryoSat surveys almost all – 96% – of the Antarctic continent, reaching to within 215 km of the South Pole. In addition, it has increased coverage over coastal regions, where today’s ice losses are concentrated. 'Thanks to its novel instrument design and to its near-polar orbit, CryoSat allows us to survey coastal and high-latitude regions of Antarctica that were beyond the capability of past altimeter missions, and it seems that these regions are crucial for determining the overall imbalance,' said Prof. Andrew Shepherd from the University of Leeds, UK, who led the study. The losses were most pronounced along the fast-flowing ice streams of the Amundsen Sea sector (pictured), with thinning rates of 4-8 m per year near to the grounding lines ¿ where the ice streams lift up off the land and begin to float out over the ocean . In particular, newly mapped areas by CryoSat in West Antarctica have now brought altimeter observations closer to estimates based on other approaches. This area has long been identified as the most vulnerable to changes in climate. Recent assessments say its glaciers may have passed a point of irreversible retreat. 'Although we are fortunate to now have, in CryoSat, a routine capability to monitor the polar ice sheets, the increased thinning we have detected in West Antarctica is a worrying development,' said Professor Shepherd. Vast glaciers in West Antarctica seem to be locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming that may push up sea levels for centuries, scientists have claimed. In a few hundred years they say the irreversible melt that has already started could eventually add four to 12 feet (1.2 to 3.7 metres) to current sea levels. A Nasa study looking at 40 years of ground, airplane and satellite data of what researchers call 'the weak underbelly of West Antarctica' shows the melt is happening faster than scientists had predicted, crossing a critical threshold that has begun a domino-like process. Two new studies indicate that part of the huge West Antarctic ice sheet is starting a slow collapse in an unstoppable way. Six glaciers, eaten away from below by a warming of sea waters around the frozen continent, were flowing fast into the Amundsen Sea, according to the report based on data from 1992 to 2011 .

Six glaciers, eaten away from below by a warming of sea waters around the frozen continent, were flowing fast into the Amundsen Sea, according to the report based on data from 1992 to 2011 . Evidence shows 'a large sector of the West Antarctic ice sheet has gone into a state of irreversible retreat', says lead author Eric Rignot of the University of California, Irvine, and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. 'It adds concrete evidence that dramatic changes are under way in this part of our planet. 'The challenge is to use this evidence to test and improve the predictive skill of climate models.' The findings were published in Geophysical Research Letters. 'We at ESA are extremely pleased to see CryoSat achieve yet another one of its primary mission objectives. 'It is a great testament to the hard work put in by the whole team, who have worked on the mission over the past 10 years,' said Tommaso Parrinello, CryoSat Mission Manager.","The polar ice sheets are a major contributor to the rise in global sea levels .

The franchise has been known as the Redskins since 1933, when it played in Boston. In a written response, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said 'diversity and inclusion' has long been a focus of the NFL. 'The intent of the team's name has always been to present a strong, positive and respectful image,' McCarthy said. 'The name is not used by the team or the NFL in any other context, though we respect those that view it differently.' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Sen.

The German international has been heavily linked with United in recent days, as rumours of his discontent under coach Pep Guardiola have grown. But speaking to the Austrian paper Krone, Muller played down the idea that he might leave Bayern this summer. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Five of the best goals scored by United target Thomas Muller . Denial: Thomas Muller has denied he is leaving Bayern Munich to sign for Manchester United this summer . 'I didn't make these rumours up myself, so I don't particularly want to comment on them too much, but I'm definitely not about to jump ship at Bayern,' said the 24-year-old, 'That said, I can't make any guarantees (that I'll stay at the club) for all time.' Muller's apparent frustration has stemmed from a lack of playing time in Guardiola's rotation system, with appearances being particularly sparse in the Champions League. At various points in the season, he has appeared openly annoyed in post-match interviews about having to sit on the bench. Many have speculated that, with Louis van Gaal set to take over at Manchester United, Muller might make the switch to the Premier League. The Dutchman was the man who established Muller as a first-team player at Bayern. Frustrated: Muller has not played as much as he'd liked because of Pep Guardiola's rotation system . Blow: Incoming Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal will be disappointed to learn Muller is staying put . But as rumours have grown, many prominent figures around the Munich club, most recently Franz Beckenbauer and Steffen Effenberg, have come out to discourage Muller from leaving. The native Bavarian has been described a 'rock' at Bayern, and 'unimaginable elsewhere'. The speculation around Bayern's unsettled squad will not end with Müller's comments today, however, as other players have commented about their frustration in recent days. Jerome Boateng told reporters at a sponsorship event that 'the atmosphere among the squad isn't very good anymore', while Javi Martinez openly said that he had imagined a different career path at Bayern to the one he has taken this season.

"By . Rebecca Seales . The parents of a 16-year-old boy have filed a $10 million lawsuit after a high-school English teacher allegedly plied their son with cannabis and repeatedly had sex with him in her office. Married teacher Erin Sayar, 36, was meant to be tutoring Kevin Eng twice a week at James Madison High School in Brooklyn, New York - but their relationship quickly took a sexual turn. The Eng family's lawyer, Bruce Baron, claims Sayar gave the youth pot from a stash she kept hidden in her office filing cabinet. 'Rape': The 36-year-old married teacher was allegedly having sex with Kevin Eng when she was meant to be tutoring him . A report by school investigators found that Sayar, who has a young daughter, was found out last November when the boy's girlfriend saw them flirting and became suspicious. After hacking Eng's Facebook account, the girl found messages he had sent to Sayar which read, 'I love you so much' and 'I always loved you, since last year.' Sayar had replied, writing, 'Oh no — I’m not putting myself out there again. I made that mistake last night and you couldn’t handle it.' Despite this, the teacher gave the boy her mobile number and ordered him to delete their conversations. Devastated, the girl informed school officials of the pair's exchanges, and confronted her boyfriend. According to the school's report, Eng admitted having oral sex and intercourse with Sayar between eight to 12 times. Allegations: Married teacher Erin Sayar is accused of having sex with 16-year-old pupil Kevin Eng where he said they were sexually involved eight to 12 times . The New York Post reports that the lovers exchanged an incredible 3,856 text messages over a 17-day period in December, an average of 227 per day. One midnight tryst apparently saw Sayar pick the boy up from his house in her car. 'Eventually, they began kissing and then engaged in sexual intercourse and oral sex inside the SUV,' the report said, adding that the boy had described tattoos on intimate parts of Sayar’s body. A spokesman for the Department of Education said Sayar, who earns just over $78,000 (£50,000) a year, is still technically employed at the school, although she was removed from the classroom in January. The school investigators have submitted their report to Brooklyn's District Attorney Charles Hynes, strongly recommending she be fired. Eng, who is now 17, is still a pupil at the school. The sordid allegations are not the first to hit James Madison High School, christened 'Horndog High' after its past sex scandals. Language teachers Cindy Mauro and Alini Brito were dismissed from their posts after an alleged lesbian romp in a school classroom in November 2009 - a claim they both denied. Prior to that, 29-year-old English teacher Craig Roffman was sacked and arrested in 2005 after he was found emailing child pornography.","Alleged affair uncovered when 16-year-old's girlfriend hacked his Facebook account .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Larger than a five pence piece, this huge hornet invaded a family home and took  ten minutes to die after it was sprayed with poison. The huge insect, which measured 2.5inches, was feared to be a potentially lethal Asian hornet, which are feared to be heading to Britain from France. It flew into the kitchen of  Rebecca Smith's home in Baldwins Gate, Staffordshire, and even after her partner Michael Elwell doused it in fly spray it continued to tear around the couple's home before it finally died ten minutes later. Insect: Larger than a five pence piece, this insect was feared to be a 'killer' Asian hornet. It invaded a family home and took ten minutes to die after it was sprayed with poison . Experts at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)'s National Bee Unit have confirmed that the insect is not an Asian hornet, and was in fact a native European hornet. Nevertheless, the couple and Mr Elwell's children Hannah,16, and 12-year-old Jake, are desperately searching for a potential nest in their garden, and say they are nervous of entering rooms in their home should they come across another insect. Asian hornets have already been spotted in France and could find their way to the UK via freighter, or even by flying across the channel. The insects are smaller than British hornets, and have been blamed for the deaths of six people in France who died from anaphylactic shock after being stung. Native: Experts at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)'s National Bee Unit have confirmed that the insect is not an Asian hornet, and was in fact a native European hornet . Pal: Ms Smith's friend Carl Barnett, pictured, said he had seen plenty of hornets and wasps - but none this big . Nature experts also fear that should the hornets make it to Britain they could threaten the already dwindling population of honeybees - which they poison and use to feed their larvae. Ms Smith, 36, spotted the  winged insect as she went to fetch her stepchildren ice lollies from the freezer on Monday, before calling Mr Elwell, 46, to the rescue. 'I went into the kitchen to fetch two ice lollies for the children and saw it on the window,' she said. Migration: The hornets are believed to have first arrived in France on a shipment of Chinese pottery in 2004. As yet there have been no confirmed sightings in the UK . 'It was quite big, around 6cm and I . locked it in the room because I wanted to kill it. It was quite scary . and I feared for young Hannah and Jake. 'I quickly called for my partner to . help and he came in with some sort of spray and killed it, I didn’t want . the thing to escape in case it stung someone. 'I was quite shocked as I have never seen one before and certainly didn’t expect to see one at home. 'It just looked like a huge wasp, I don’t know much about them but it is obvious they are quite dangerous. 'I think it was just a one off and I . haven’t locked anyone in the house, the windows are still open and we . are just hoping we don’t get another one. 'My partner has had a look and we haven’t seen a nest anywhere but you just never know, we are on high alert now.' Ms Smith’s friend Carl Barnett, added: 'It is definitely a good-sized one. 'I’ve seen plenty of hornets and wasps over the years but nothing quite this big. 'It looks nasty and I certainly wouldn’t want to be stung - that would be painful.' Asian hornets are believed to have first arrived in France on a shipment of Chinese pottery in 2004. As yet there have been no confirmed sightings in the UK. 'We don’t want the Asian hornet established in this country as it would become yet another pressure on the already declining population of honey bees here,' said Craig Slawson, a co-ordinator at Staffordshire Ecological Records. 'At the moment there are reports of them in northern France, but the Channel is acting as a water barrier and they have not tried to come over - yet. 'However, if conditions change and there are prevailing winds, there is every likelihood it could appear over here.' Concern has been raised about the potential arrival of the Asian hornet in the UK as they are known to attack honey bees - numbers of which are already dwindling. There are now just 25 native species of honey bee in the UK and numbers may be as low as 50,000 at the height of summer. Some experts say the hornets eat as many as 50 bees a day, and Government scientists are drawing up a rapid response plan to combat the arrival of the deadly Asian hornet on our shores. The insects, which have the Latin name vespa velutina, are smaller than a British hornet, with queens growing up to 3cm in length, and workers up to 25mm. Their bodies are dark brown or black, and bordered with a yellow band, while they have one band across the abdomen. Their legs are brown with yellow ends and they have an orange face. They only fly during daytime hours, unlike the European species. An Asian hornet's sting is thought to be no more painful than that of a British hornet to humans. 'There have been no confirmed sightings of Asian hornets in the UK – they are smaller than our own native hornets and are no more dangerous,' said a spokesman from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). 'We are aware of the potential impacts they could have on honey bees and have plans in place to eradicate them if they are identified. 'In Great Britain we would not expect Asian hornets to establish outside southern parts of England and Wales due to colder weather.'","Insect, measuring 2.5ins, was feared to be a potentially lethal Asian Hornet .

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . Paul Scholes has claimed that former Manchester United team-mate Wayne Rooney may be past his best and says England must show the strength to drop him if he performs poorly at another World Cup. The Old Trafford legend believes that Rooney, 28, must live up to expectations in Brazil if he wants to be considered as one of the world’s top players after failing to score in the last two tournaments in Germany and South Africa. Scholes, who was on United’s coaching staff for the final four games of the season, also claimed that Rooney does not work as well in a strike partnership and that could mean Louis van Gaal has to choose between him and Robin van Persie next season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney in England training . Reached his peak?

Since then he’s . played at Euro 2004, two World Cups, the Premier League, and Champions . League every year. There’s a chance he’s worn out. Remember the name: Rooney (left) made his debut for boyhood club Everton at the age of 16 in 2002 . ‘I’m . not saying Wayne needs to be dropped, but if his form doesn’t get up to . scratch in the warm-ups, or in the first game of the World Cup, it will . be interesting to see if the  England management team has the balls to . make that decision. ‘We . have quality forwards in the squad this time. That should give Wayne . the competition he needs to spur him on a little more.’ Scholes believes Rooney needs to conserve his energy and focus on scoring goals if he is going to be most effective in Brazil. Coaches: Scholes was part of the United interim management team with Phil Neville and Nicky Butt . He . added: ‘To get the very best from Wayne, the manager needs to tell him, . “Don’t bother running back. Stay up top. Stay centre  forward. Score . goals. That’s your job in my team”. ‘Wayne’s . almost like a schoolkid. He loves being a footballer. Wayne wants all . the responsibility to score. He’ll try to play left back, right back. Sometimes he does that too much instead of saving himself and his energy . for what his teams need — the ball in the net.

He said he spoke with her in April about his concerns, two months before he was told he had failed her class. Vogl-Bauer contends the comments amount to defamation, while Llewellyn says his goal was simply to inform the public about how the professor treated him. Tim Edwards, the attorney representing Vogl-Bauer, said the comments could be especially damaging to someone in a small professional community. He said he and Vogl-Bauer agree that students should be allowed to express their opinions, 'but when you go so far beyond that, into a concerted effort to attack somebody's reputation because things didn't go your way, that's much different.' Edwards and Vogl-Bauer asked Llewellyn to take down his online comments and videos. They filed the lawsuit after he refused. Llewellyn said it's important for the videos and comments to stay online so the public can remain informed. He has dedicated several blogs to his arguments with the professor he claims treated him unfairly. 'I don't feel I've (gone) too far with my videos and comments because everything posted basically communicates exactly how Sally Vogl-Bauer treated me,' Llewellyn said. Vogl-Bauer has denied all claims made by her former student. The lawsuit seeks punitive damages and attorney and trial fees. The case is scheduled to go a jury trial in September. It's not clear how successful the lawsuit will be, but a similar case in Minnesota ended with a ruling in favor of the person who posted the online rating. In that case, a doctor took offense when a patient's son went on a rate-your-doctor website and called him 'a real tool,' slang for stupid or foolish. The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled in January 2013 that the comment wasn't defamatory because it was an opinion protected by free-speech rights.

"By . James  Nye . The bodies of more than two-dozen U.S. veterans at a Southern California morgue will finally receive proper burials, officials said. After months of speculation, the bodies of 28 veterans were moved Friday for burial from the Los Angeles County Morgue to the Riverside National Cemetery. The morgue and Veterans Administration appear to blame each other for the delay, according to local news reports. Final resting place: This Memorial Day weekend, 28 of the 60 or so veterans will be buried at Riverside National Cemetery . 'I think it's incomprehensible,' said Richard Burns, a Marine Corps veteran who goes to the Riverside National Cemetery and volunteers to lead memorial services for the unclaimed and often indigent vets. Often, Burns and a handful of volunteers are the only people in attendance. 'It's kinda sad that these people don't get the proper care that they deserve,' Burns said. 'Even after death.' Morgue officials said that the veterans' bodies were unclaimed and they didn't know how long they were there, blaming the Veterans Administration for the delay. The bodies of as many as 60 veterans may have been at the morgue for the past year and a half, the TV station reported. 'There are about 60 decedents of probable veteran status that have awaited disposition for about a year as a result of a personnel change in the Veterans Affairs office and stringent identification/eligibility processes required by the VA,' the morgue said in an email to the station. Blame game: The morgue and Veterans Administration appear to blame each other for the delay, the station added . Meanwhile, Cindy Van Bibber, a VA spokeswoman, said the agency was never notified by the morgue that the bodies were processed and ready to be buried. A proper burial should take about three days, she said. Van Bibber said that 'at no point' did the morgue contact the VA and tell the agency about the bodies piling up there. 'We definitely weren't contacted or we would have had a service for the veteran,' she said. By law, a veteran is supposed to receive a proper burial.","The bodies of up to 60 veterans have remained unclaimed at the Los Angeles County Morgue for almost 18 months .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Poverty and a lack of contraception means one in three babies are aborted in Detroit. A new report about the high number of terminations in the Motor City in Detroit have been compared to the worst rates on earth. 'We’re seeing a picture that looks more like some Third World country than someplace in the United States,' Dr. Susan Schooley, head of the Department of Family Medicine at Henry Ford Hospital, told The Detroit News. Detroit is considered by many to be a failed city because of its financial devastation. Sad story: Nearly one-third of all pregnancies in the city of Detroit end in abortion, a statistic public health officials blame on rising poverty and dwindling access to affordable contraception . On the rise: The abortion rate for women who reside in Detroit has increased steadily since 2000, even though the statewide abortion rate has decreased . The report reveals that an estimated 31 percent of pregnancies there end in abortion, what one doctor compared to the worst rates on earth . By comparison, some of the very worst abortion rates around the world are some of the most repressive nations. Vietnam has an rate of 83 abortions per 1,000 women, the Russian Federation, where the rate is 68, and Ukraine, where the rate is 57 per 1,000 women. Although measured in a slightly different way showed there were 5,693 abortions among 18,360 pregnancies in Detroit during 2012. Statewide, there were 22,699 abortions among 160,219 pregnancies in Michigan. It means there were 37.9 per 1,000 women aged 15-44 abortions in 2012, up from 27.5 per 1,000 women in 2001. Statistics: The abortion rate in Detroit alone is so high is has been compared by some as a Third World country . Overall, the U.S. abortion rate in 2011, the most recent data available, was 17 per 1,000 women. The report believes poverty in the city is a huge contributing factor. Detroit has dropped in population over the last few decades as hundreds of thousands of residents have left. During 2013 the state intervened in its finances because the city was faced with a continued decline in its tax revenue, while costs, especially those for lucrative city pensions negotiated by unions over the years, were skyrocketing. Last year the state intervened in its finances because of an insurmountable debt facing taxpayers. Also, there are no longer any taxpayer subsidies for contraceptives. Funding dropped from more than $5 million in 2006 to about $700,000 in 2013. 'It’s another public health challenge for Detroit, which is the most dangerous city in America to be a child, according to a Detroit News study. Published in January, the study found that the death rate for childre . Terminations: Of an estimated 18,360 pregnancies among Detroit residents in 2012, 5,693 ended in abortion, or 31 percent . n 18 and younger is higher in Detroit than in any U.S. city its size or larger. The highest number of deaths occur in the first year, most related to premature birth. Homicide is the second greatest cause of child deaths in the city,' the News report said. 'Both routine primary care and family planning-specific primary care are not available in Detroit,' Dr Schooley told the Detroit News. 'To the extent that a significant proportion of those (pregnancies) are unplanned, it leads to all these decision-making options of which abortion is one lousy choice.' Health professionals say they expect Obamacare will reduce abortions by providing funding for more birth control. Dr. Jay Berman, chief of gynecology at DMC Hutzel Hospital and division chief for gynecology at Wayne State University Medical School, said the subsidies in Obamacare will give women greater access to the more expensive treatments – such as injections, intra-uterine devices (IUDs) and subdermal implants.","Doctors have compared the rate unborn babies are killed to that of a a Third World country .

"By . Hugo Gye . An aide to the Turkish prime minister who became internationally notorious when he kicked a mourning protester has been sacked over the controversy. Yusuf Yerkel was filmed earlier this month attacking a man during a demonstration about the Soma mining disaster in which more than 300 people died. He subsequently went on sick leave after claiming he had injured his leg in the incident - but now prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sacked him as his deputy chief of staff. Fired: Yusuf Yerkel, right, has lost his job as an aide to the Turkish prime minister after being pictured kicking a protester after the Soma mining disaster . Anger: Mr Yerkel became a symbol of the government's mishandling of the tragedy in which 300 people died . The mining accident has prompted national protests against the government, accused by mourning relatives of mishandling the aftermath. Mr Yerkel became a symbol of the regime's alleged disdain for the victims when photographs emerged of him lashing out at the man, who was being restrained by two security officers. In an apparent bid to quell the outrage, Mr Erdogan fired him from his post earlier this week. 'Yusuf Yerkel apologised but it was too late,' a government spokesman said. 'At the end of the discussion the Prime Minister fired him directly.' The former aide is now due to be re-assigned to a different government job, according to a Turkish news agency. Assistant: Mr Yerkel, right, was the deputy chief of staff to prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, left . Mr Yerkel took sick leave soon after the incident first came to light, saying he had injured his leg by attacking the protester. Although he later apologised for his actions, he insisted that the mourner had provoked him. 'I am sorry as I was not able to keep my calm in the face of all provocations, insults and attacks I was subjected to,' he said. Mr Erdogan, who faced mass protests in Istanbul last year, has been the subject for virulent criticism for his response to the Soma disaster. However, he is still likely to become Turkey's first ever elected president later this year.","Yusuf Yerkel was pictured attacking a protester at demonstration .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A California woman who was arrested last year for allegedly disrupting a city council meeting by continuously clapping now says her constitutional rights were violated when she was taken into custody. Letitia Pepper, an attorney and longtime critic of the local government in Riverside, has filed a lawsuit in federal court over the June 25, 2013, incident. Pepper was handcuffed and removed from the city council meeting, but she was never actually charged with a crime. Disruptive: Letitia Pepper was taken into custody for being disruptive during a city council meeting last year . In February, a spokesman for the Riverside County District Attorney's Office said no charges would be filed against the woman 'based on a lack of sufficient evidence,' the Riverside Press Enterprise reports. Pepper's arrest came after she and other members of the audience during that particular meeting began applauding for speakers with whom they agreed. The town's mayor, William 'Rusty' Bailey warned the audience - and Pepper specifically - to not applaud for speakers because it could dissuade others with opposing views from speaking out. Pepper's lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and named the city, Mayor Bailey, City Attorney Greg Priamos and police Chief Sergio Diaz as defendants. 'The city of Riverside seeks to provide an environment at City Council . meetings where free speech rights are respected and where everyone can . feel comfortable expressing their views,' Bailey wrote in statement delivered to the newspaper through a spokesman . The mayor added that rules of conduct during city meetings are meant to 'ensure that the business of the City can be . carried out efficiently and without unnecessary disruptions.' Applause: Pepper and others were continuously clapping for speakers after the mayor warned her not to . Pepper, who the local paper describes as an 'activist' who has run for both mayor and for a spot on the City Council, says that the clapping by her and others was done only as speakers were done speaking, and it in no way was disrupting anyone or keeping anyone from speaking out. On Thursday, Pepper said she felt she needed to sue 'because these guys are doing things that are illegal and they’re not . going to stop doing it. ...What happened to me was totally wrong.' Constitutional law expert and Dean of the University of California at Irvine Law School Erwin Chemerinsky  told the paper the city has the right to develop its own rules for its meetings. However, those rules can't violate the First Amendment to the Constitution. 'So long as the City Council ... can do its work, there’s no basis for stopping the expression,' Chemerinsky said.","Letitia Pepper and others were clapping during a city council meeting in Riverside, California last year .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Daily Mail Reporter . A court in India's capital has dropped a weapons charge against a New York City police officer and is allowing him to leave the country after two months, with his arrest believed to have been linked to the indictment of an Indian diplomat in the U.S. earlier this year. Officer Manny Encarnacion was arrested in March while visiting his wife in New Delhi after Indian airport authorities discovered three bullets he had accidentally packed in his luggage. The 49-year-old had been out on bail since his arrest, but was barred from leaving India until the case was resolved. Before leaving for India, Encarnacion went to a police firing range and put the bullets in a coat pocket, according to New York City police. Free: Charges have now been dropped against NYPD cop Manny Encarnacion, who busted in India on March 10 for mistakenly carrying three bullets in his luggage and not allowed to leave the country . Good news: Samarjeet Pattnaik, attorney for New York City police officer Manny Encarnacion, tells meedia in New Delhi, India, a court has dropped a weapons charge against the officer and is allowing him to leave the country . He packed the coat for the trip, forgetting that the ammunition was there, the police said. Encarnacion, 49, joined the NYPD in 2004 and is assigned to a precinct in Harlem. His lawyer, Samarjit Pattnaik, said the court heard the case Friday. 'All charges against the officer were quashed,' he said. Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Patrick J. Lynch said: 'We are pleased that police officer Encarnacion's unfortunate ordeal has been resolved and that he'll soon be returning home.' Encarnacion's arrest took place around the same time as a diplomatic spat between the United States and India over the arrest and strip search of an Indian consular official for alleged visa fraud.

Police are looking for a pair of thieves on the loose in New York City who stole a 14-year-old's iPhone at a concert then had the audacity to take a selfie to send to the boy's friends along with a dirty text message to his mother. The men allegedly stole the iPhone 5 from 14-year-old James Pugliatti of Westchester on April 17 at an under 18 event at Stage 48 on 48th street in Manhattan's Upper West Side. The mystery duo used the iPhone to take a photo of themselves on the subway and then proceeded to send the photo to all of the boy's friends on Snapchat, reported the New York Post.

One of James' friends was able to take a screenshot of the Snapchat which he then forwarded to James' mother. His mother then sent the photo to the police who are on the lookout for the suspects. James didn't only lose his phone but he also lost a $50 otter phone case. 'I was pissed. I had to get another phone,' he told the Post. 'They’re pretty stupid. The whole thing was really annoying.

"By . Belinda Robinson . Divorce Battle: Alisa Thiry, 49, said that taking her husband Didier, a wealthy Belgian hotelier to court had been a difficult and painful experience . A former model at the centre of a £40million divorce battle with her husband has hit back at suggestions that she is a gold digger. Alisa Thiry, 49, a former model and fashion editor at Elle magazine, who lives in London's affluent Notting Hill said that taking her husband Didier, a wealthy Belgian hotelier to court had been a 'difficult and painful experience.' However, it's not the first time Mrs Thiry has faced the difficult decision. Before she married Mr Thiry, 52, a property tycoon who was worth £8 million, she won an eight figure settlement from her first husband Stephen Marks, the wealthy owner of fashion brand French Connection. Mr Marks is the father of her three children and her split from him was resolved relatively smoothly. To . pay off Mrs Thiry, Mr Marks sold £40million worth of shares . in his company and she subsequently received a settlement somewhere in . the region of that amount. Breaking . her silence yesterday, Mrs Thiry said that she . had flourished through being a 'successful journalist and . businesswoman.' But . she is battling against headlines thanks to her acrimonious divorce battle, which . saw her squabbling with husband number two over their £45million . fortune. Her second husband is a well-known figure in his . native country thanks to his flourishing hospitality empire, including a . boutique hotel in Brussels and a decades-old restaurant in a quaint . village. The key bone of contention is a £13.8million loan a company owned by Alisa made to a company owned by Mr Thiry. Naturally, now the couple are no longer together, she wishes her loan to be repaid. Defiant: Didier Thiry, left, refuses to return to Britain after his wife Alisa, right, managed to have him jailed . Chic: The 49-year-old former magazine fashion editor walked away with an eight-figure settlement after splitting from Mr Marks, the co-founder of French Connection, in 2004 after the couple had three children together . Last week, at a hearing of the Family . Division of the High Court the judge ordered Mr Thiry to be jailed for . four months for failing to disclose information about the loan. The couple’s assets include a house in . Notting Hill and a luxurious property on the Caribbean island of St . Barts, where Alisa and Didier first met not long after her divorce from . Mr Marks in 2004. The High Court hearing heard that Mr . Thiry had a fortune of £8million when their relationship began. A large . chunk of the couple’s combined fortune is made up of the money Alisa . took from her first divorce. But Mr Thiry is currently in Belgium, and is said to be in no mood to come rushing back to Britain to serve his sentence. 'I can’t come to London,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'You don’t know what it is for me not to go to London and be condemned to jail.' Although he refuses to discuss the details of the court case, he claims to have launched rival proceedings in Belgium against Alisa. The couple were married overseas around . 2006. Following their separation, it is understood a decree nisi was . issued, but a decree absolute cannot be given until a financial . settlement has been agreed. Mrs Thiry is the daughter of Raymond Chapman and his wife, Valerie, both hairdressers. She . was born Alisa Chapman in Cheltenham in 1964 but changed her name to . Green after her mother’s marriage to Ronald Green in 1973. Husband number one: Alisa Thiry, pictured with her first husband Stephen Marks, has had her second husband Didier Thiry jailed, in a court battle over their £45m assets . Mrs Thiry has released a statement to complain about 'misleading statements' about the case. In the statement released by her solicitors, she sent out a warning to all newspapers against 'repeating . the offensive sugestion that despite being a successful journalist and . businesswoman I have somehow made a career out of marrying for money.' She . added: 'I hope now that all sections of the press will respect our . privacy, and that none of the newspapers will seek to capitalise further . on this difficult situation.' Her statement was, in part, a response to unkind mutterings that she is a woman who weighs up a potential husband’s suitability according to the size of his wallet. ‘It didn’t go unnoticed that she took Stephen to the cleaners,’ says one who knows her. ‘She told her friends she was going to take him for everything she could — and she did. He was devastated. There are no feelings of warmth between Alisa and Stephen now —  just loathing. ‘No one was surprised when Alisa married another multi-millionaire. She has an uncanny way of latching on to money. I think Didier was probably warned, but sadly paid no attention.’","Alisa Thiry, 49, said she is a 'successful journalist and businesswoman'

"By . Daniel Mills . A disgraced doctor who was jailed for killing two prostitutes in 2011 went on drug-fueled sex binges with other escorts, spending more than $140,000 in a nine-month period between their deaths, an investigation has revealed. And instead of being barred from visiting Sydney brothels after he was deemed a risk to the safety of sex workers, Malaysian national Suresh Nair was given free rein to spend his thousands on drugs and the services of brothel clients he fed them to. The Sun Herald has published details of the former Nepean Hospital doctor's extravagant episodes with women and drugs, including one 25-hour binge in the weeks leading up to the death of sex worker Suellen Zaupa. Suellen Zaupa died in November 2009 when she was involved in one of Nair's sordid sex binges . Victoria McIntyre died in February of the same year Ms Zauapa death. Between their deaths, Nair went on a rampage of drug-induced sex binges with prostitutes . Ms Zaupa, 22, died in November 2009 nine months after he killed Victoria McIntyre, 23, during separate drug-fueled sex orgies. He was jailed for eight years for manslaughter back in 2011, but on appeal, had his sentence downgraded to five years and four months and will be eligible for parole in July. And while he prepares to walk free, a dossier of his elaborate dealings in the months between his victim's deaths have been revealed. The investigation shows Nair's continued abuse of drugs and the women he shared them with, including an elaborate day of binging just weeks leading up to his second victim's demise. During the 25-hour ordeal on September 11 and 12, 2009, Nair spent close to $57,000 on drugs and the services of women at a room at Liaisons brothel, Edgecliff. More... Male nurse jailed for sexually abusing vulnerable mental health patients in hospital . World Cup warning over child prostitution with girls as young as 11 forced to walk the streets of Brazil targeting foreign tourists for sex . Suspected drug ring busted in Canberra . Receipt records show he spent about $15,000 for the services of nine sex workers, while the rest was listed under 'fantasy', 'cash out' and 'advance', words commonly used to disguise the drugs he paid for at the venue. Arriving at Liaisons at 10.50pm on September 11, the day-long sex romp lasted until 11.50pm the following night, but it was by no means an isolated occasion. In May, Nair booked four girls for another of his all-night binges, which cost $19,640 - $10,000 of which was marked down as 'tips', and in August, he arrived at the same brothel after midnight where he paid $8,905 for the services of two escorts during a six-hour orgy . But according to a document obtained by The Sun Herald, none of these events should ever have taken place because the brothel was aware that Nair was a high risk to workers' safety. A state government letter circulated to Sydney brothels warned of a prostitute's near-death ordeal in Kings Cross at the hands of a 'doctor' of Indian appearance, named 'Suresh'. The woman subsequently collapsed from a drug overdose, sparking the warning which was kept secret from the public but circulated via a closed sex industry publication called the Ugly Mug List. The Ugly Mug List, which an industry boss said all brothels read, serves to unify and protect sex workers by outing dangerous clients. Nine women received $18,305, including a house cut . $17,320 billed as 'Cash out' $20,330 billed as an 'Advance' $450 billed as a 'Tip' $56,405 in total . The owner of consultancy firm Brothel Busters, Chris Seage, told the Sun Herald it was unbelievable that the brothels were ignoring the government advice about Nair. 'Everyone in the industry reads the Ugly Mug list so it is disappointing that some businesses continued to compromise lives by allowing women to see Nair,' he told the Sun Herald. He also said Nair, who is eligible for parole in July, should not be granted it until he comes clean about where he got his drugs from. 'He should not be given parole until he informs police of the names of the escort agencies and brothels that were supplying him.' He said it was disappointing that some businesses continued to compromise lives by allowing women to see Nair. Aside from the two sex workers he killed and the numerous women's lives he put at risk, there remains an unknown number of hospital patients whose operations went wrong as the neurosurgeon continued his day job at Nepean Hospital. The NSW Health Care Complaints Commission cancelled Nair’s registration as a medical practitioner in December, and he is not eligible to apply for re-registration until 31 December 2019.

At the conclusion of Friday's performance of Boeing Boeing at the Des Moines Community Playhouse in Des Moines, Iowa, the play's director announced to the audience that he would like audience member Renee Schwarz to join the cast on the stage because the play's star, Davenport, had something to ask her.

A dead 30-foot whale was found on the Brooklyn side of New York Harbor after it was struck the 144,000 ton Norwegian Cruise Line ship called the Breakaway (not pictured) Marine biologists conduct a necropsy on an over 55 foot long finback whale on a dock in Jersey City, N.J. that was stuck on the bow of a container ship . The whale was 45-years-old and a necropsy found that the whale suffered blunt force trauma and broken ribs linking a cruise ship crash as the cause of death. The Huffington Post reports that another sei whale was found dead and attached to a ship that was docking near Philadelphia recently. There was also a third whale strike involving a fin whale but no more details will be available until the NOAA finishes their investigation. 'Nobody wants to hit a whale,' said Marjorie Mooney-Seus, a spokeswoman. 'So we want people to have a greater awareness that they're out there now. According to the NOAA the average rate of whale strikes is about one every few weeks compared to three in the past few weeks. The NOAA reported that there were 28 recorded whale strikes in the Northeast between 2006 and 2010. A spokesman for the Marine Mammal Stranding Center said it is not uncommon for whales like this deceased fin whale to make their way into shipping lanes as they travel up and the down the East Coast . A National Marine Fisheries Service survey found that worldwide there were 292 confirmed whale strikes from 1975 through 2002. Rob DiGiovanni who runs a marine mammal rescue group on Long Island told The Huffington Post that that he's been seeing 'more evidence of shift strikes and that's definitely a concern.' In the past there would be years in between whale strikes but now there are a couple reported every year said DiGiovanni. There have been no reported strikes of endangered North Atlantic right whales. DiGiovanni and his group hope to find out why whale strikes are on the rise and whether they are related to to a change in food sources, more ships, or more whales. For instance, off the coast of Boston, school of fish called sea lance have made the Massachusetts Bay a 'whale feeding ground.'Laura Howes of Boston Harbor Cruises said that twenty to thirty whales are being spotted on every whale watching excursion which is 10 times the usual amount.","There were three whale strikes recently, .

"By . Zoe Szathmary . An Ohio family was reunited with its lost dog that went missing almost four-and-a-half years ago. The Sinnett-Dekrell family lost German Shepherd Angel when she got out on Christmas Day in 2009, the Coshocton Tribune reports. No one responded to the family's extensive search campaign, which included fliers and social media. Reunited! Maggie Sinnett and sons Brandon and Andrew Dekrell are seen with dog Angel . Lost: Angel, seen here, got out on Christmas Day in 2009 and was separated from her family for nearly four-and-a-half years . 'No one answered any of our fliers,' mother Maggie Sinnett told the paper. 'You go looking everywhere, but you don’t know where to look. You feel lost. You feel hopeless.' Almost four-and-a-half years after Angel went missing, Sinnett was contacted by Richland County Dog Warden Dave Jordan on Monday, the paper says. Angel had been microchipped by the Sinnett-Dekrell family, but was wearing a collar from a different owner. She was picked up on Wednesday. 'He said ""We found your dog,""' Sinnett told the Tribune. 'I was not expecting that.' Recovered: Angel, seen here, was reunited with her family on Wednesday . Sinnett 'was a little upset that someone kept her dog for so long,' the paper reports, 'but she was also appreciative that person was kind enough to keep her dog healthy.' 'She was like my child,' Sinnett told the Tribune. 'She was obviously very well loved and we are very thankful for that.' Angel ran away multiple times before the 2009 incident, the paper reports, but had been recovered. '[Angel] is back in our lives for a reason, and I do believe that,' Sinnett said. 'I don’t know what God’s plan is, but she’s here now and we’re all thankful.'","Angel, a German Shepherd, got out on Christmas Day in 2009 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A North Carolina woman known in the media as 'paralyzed bride' after she became a quadriplegic when a friend jokingly pushed her into a shallow pool at her bachelorette party has opened up about the incident, and shed some light on the relationship she currently has with the friend who pushed her into the pool more than four years ago. Rachelle Friedman has been promoting her new book - The Promise: A Tragic Accident, A Paralyzed Bride and the Power of Love, Loyalty and Friendship - by giving media interviews over the last several months to talk about her tragic story, and what her life has been like learning to live life as a quadriplegic. Last week, Friedman participated in an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on the social news-sharing website Reddit.com, and the question about her relationship with the friend who pushed her in the pool was brought up. Not awkward: Rachelle Friedman (center) says she doesn't blame the friend who caused her injury . Pact: Friedman's mother says the women at her daughter's bachelorette party have made a silent pact to never publicly reveal who pushed her into the pool . Paralysis: Friedman broke her neck when a friend jokingly pushed her into a shallow pool during her bachelorette party . Friedman has described the incident that left her paralyzed as an 'innocent' accident, and a Reddit user wanted to know how that friend acted around her now, four years after her 'innocent' push left Friedman without the ability to walk. 'Neither one of us are as giggly and carefree as we used to be,' Friedman wrote in response to the question. 'We were always really responsible but I mean we were in our low 20s just right out of college without a care in the world. So obviously age, life and the accident has changed how we act. She used to be really really awkward around me because when we weren't talking about the accident it felt like we were avoiding it. Over the years we've normalized everything to an extent. We can laugh, and talk about other things so it's not as awkward.' Parents-to-be: A tragic accident at Rachelle Friedman's bachelorette party in 2010 left her paralyzed. Now, she's revealed she and husband Chris (left) are trying to have a baby via surrogate . Hopeful: The couple have launched a Go Fund Me campaign to fund the surrogacy, with the goal of raising $60,000 from donations. 'It is the final piece to our happiness so I really hope this happens for us,' she said . One of the things Friedman discusses . in her book is how she and her five friends who were with her at the . bachelorette party have developed an unspoken pact to never reveal . publicly which of the woman playfully pushed Friedman into the pool. 'She is totally fine with the girl who pushed her in the pool, . Friedman's mother, 55-year-old Carol Friedman, said in an interview with . ABC News. 'No one knows who it is and we never say her name . [publicly].' 'In the beginning, we worried about the girl,' Friedman's mother continued. 'But through . the years, we have talked about it and she has gotten so much better. We . have worried about her a lot.' Carol Friedman lives with her daughter and son-in-law because . insurance does not cover caregivers. Friedman has also revealed that she and her husband, Chris, are trying to have a baby via-a surrogate. Desperate times: While the North Carolina native (left, before the accident and right, on her wedding day) is biologically able to have children, her medications would be harmful to a fetus . Hopes and dreams: 'I want a child more than anything,' she tweeted last month . The 28-year-old, who is paralyzed from the chest down, told xoJane . that welcoming a new little member into their family 'is the final . piece to our happiness, so I really hope this happens for us.' As such, she and husband Chris have launched a Go Fund Me campaign to fund the surrogacy, with the goal of raising $60,000 from donations. 'I see baby announcements flooding my .

"By . Alex Greig . A camera lost in a shipwreck two years ago off the coast of Vancouver Island has been recovered - and the memories it contains are miraculously intact. Two students diving near Bamfield found the camera 40 feet underwater while diving for starfish as part of their research project. One of them picked up the rusty, crusted camera, unaware of how long the device had been underwater. Lost at sea: The camera was lost in a shipwreck two years ago . 'One of them picked it up and put it in his pocket and kept counting the starfish,' one of the professors overseeing the dive told ABC. 'When they came up from the dive, he said, ""Look what I found.""' Cote says she were fascinated by the many small marine creatures that had taken up residence in the camera. The first thought Professor Siobhan Gray had, however, was whether or not there were still photographs on it. She opened the device and found a memory card. 'I cleaned the contacts off of the (memory card) put it in my computer and it worked,' she told the Vancouver Sun. They made posters of the video and tacked them up in the area in an effort to find the camera's owners, and lo and behold, a member of the Coast Guard recogized one of the men in a cheery group shot. Intact: Unbelievably, the memory card still held all Paul Burgoyne's precious family photographs . Memories: Paul Burgoyne (center, back) was recognized by a Coast Guard who had rescued him when his ship Bootlegger sank of the coast of Vancouver Island . The man was Paul Burgoyne, a Vancouver artist who had been rescued by the Coast Guard two years earlier when the ship he was on, Bootlegger, sank on a 500-kilometre voyage from Vancouver to his summer home in Tahsis, B.C. 'That just shocked me,' Burgoyne told CBC. 'Getting the camera, or the photos back, that's really quite wonderful.' When the ship went down, not only did Burgoyne lose his camera in the wreck, but precious memories it contained. The last pictures he had taken was a family gathering to scatter his parents ashes at Lake of the Woods in Ontario. Repurposed: While the camera will no longer perform its original function, it has proven to be a popular home for marine life . 'I have a new respect for, you know, these electronics,' Burgoyne told CBC. 'You throw most of it away every two years, but that little card is an amazing bit of technology.' Another item on the card is a video of calm seas that Burgoyne took just before his ship was wrecked. One of Gray's acquaintances from the Coast Guard station had personally attended the Burgoyne's rescue, and was able to dig out his contact details. He left a message for Burgoyne, who called Gray the following day. 'He was thrilled. He says when he got off the phone with the Coast Guard him and his wife were laughing a great deal and mentioned how lucky he was,' she told the Vancouver Sun.","Paul Burgoyne was shipwrecked off the coast of Vancouver Island two years ago .

With its miniscule wings and perfectly formed beak, the fluffy, grey baby penguin is the newest addition to an adventure park and zoo in Pembrokeshire, Wales. The youngster - which weighs a tiny 0.2 pounds - was born on Tuesday, exactly a year to the day that a pack of 24 penguins were released into a new enclosure at the park. Scroll down for video . With its miniscule wings and perfectly formed beak, the fluffy, grey baby penguin is the newest addition to an adventure park and zoo in Pembrokeshire, Wales . The youngster - which weighs a tiny 0.2 pounds - was born on Tuesday, exactly a year to the day that a pack of 24 penguins were released into a new enclosure at the park . Zoo keepers are yet to discover the gender of the newborn and as such are holding off on naming the adorable youngster . The 48-hour old chick is the offspring of Donna and Diavlo – who were the first penguins to pair off and build a nest together in February. Zoo keepers are yet to discover the gender of the newborn and as such are holding off on naming the adorable youngster. Catrin Thomas, a penguin keeper at the Folly Farm zoo, said: ‘We are so excited to have our first penguin chick at the park. ‘We all feel like proud parents and are so happy for Donna and Diavlo. ‘We haven’t named the chick yet as we . do not know what sex it is but once we do we will give it a suitable . name - it may have to begin with ‘D’ though to follow in its parents . footsteps.’ The adorable baby Humboldt penguin was born weighing just 73 grammes (pictured) but now weighs 75 grammes - 0.2 pounds . The 48-hour old chick is the offspring of Donna and Diavlo - who were the first penguins to pair off and build a nest together in February . Catrin Thomas, a penguin keeper at the zoo, said: 'We all feel like proud parents and are so happy for Donna and Diavlo' The chick is currently surviving on a diet of fish, which are regurgitated by its parents' mouths in small but frequent amounts. Humboldt penguins originate from South America and commonly breed in the coastal areas off Peru and Chile. An adult Humboldt can grow to around 70cm in length and weighs on average nine pounds. Wild Humboldt’s tend to nest in burrows among boulders and sea caves, but sometimes set up home in the open. Most birds depart the colony after sunrise and forage in close proximity, not venturing too far away from the pack. They survive on a diet mainly made up of small schooling fish like anchovies and sardines, but sometimes supplement it with squid. Once it gets a bit older it will be ‘enrolled into penguin school’ where it will be taught by keepers how to eat and fend for itself. Caroline Davies, who also works as a keeper at the Penguin Coast enclosure at the park, said she was hopeful of more arrivals in the near future. She said: ‘We hope this is just the start of a deluge of chicks in our Humboldt penguin enclosure. ‘We currently have ten eggs being incubated by our penguin brood so are anticipating the arrival of more any day now.’ In the first few weeks of the chick’s . life, the keepers will be extremely hands-on to ensure sure the new . parents and the offspring get off to the best possible start. The . keepers will then teach the newborn chick how to feed for itself at Folly Farm's two acre state-of-the-art penguin enclosure which comes . complete with a 100m saltwater pool and manmade beach. Tim Morphew, zoo manager, said the young penguin was the first to be born at the park’s new enclosure which opened last Easter. He . said: ‘The arrival of chicks in our penguin enclosure demonstrates that . we have successfully created a healthy breeding environment for our . penguins that is as close as possible to their natural habitat. ‘We . are delighted that our first breeding season has been a success and we . look forward to welcoming more little ones to our penguin crèche.’ The chick is currently sustaining on a diet of fish, which are regurgitated by its parents' mouths in small but frequent amounts .

"By . Margot Peppers . Celebrities and health fanatics alike have long touted the benefits of drinking water, and now one woman has put it to the test. Health care journalist Sabrina Bachai told ABC News that she was inspired when she saw a girl on Instagram with 'beautiful skin and beautiful hair' who said that her secret was consuming three liters of water a day. So for an entire week, she drank the same amount - which equates to a little more than eight 12-ounce glasses a day - and the results were surprising. Scroll down for video . Drink up: Health care journalist Sabrina Bachai (pictured) tested out the theory that drinking three liters of water a day makes you healthier. She did it for a week and lost two pounds . Hydrated: Three liters is a little more than eight 12-ounce glasses, or six bottles of Poland Spring . Not only does Ms Bachai say that her skin felt smoother and looked 'fuller', but she also slept better and ended up losing two pounds. To help her get the water down more quickly, Ms Bachai drank it through a straw. She didn't change anything about her diet, and she stuck to her normal gym routine. One thing she noticed was that drinking all that water made her feel fuller. 'I wasn't snacking as much, so that helped curb my appetite a little bit. Because a lot of times when you're hungry, you're not really hungry - you're just thirsty.' The only setback was having to use the bathroom seven to eight times a day. Ms Bachai may have been pleased with the results of her experiment, but ABC's chief health and medical editor Dr Richard Besser says too much water can actually be harmful. 'Drinking water to the extreme - really . there's nothing to show that that will benefit you,' he explained. Multiple benefits: Not only does Ms Bachai say that her skin felt smoother and looked 'fuller', but she also slept better and ended up losing two pounds . Strike a balance: ABC's chief health and medical editor Dr Richard Besser says three liters isn't too much, but drinking water to the extreme can lead to seizures or even death . 'Our kidneys regulate . the salt in our blood very finely. If you surpass what your kidneys can put . out, you'll get something called water intoxication that can lead to . seizures. In fact some people have died from drinking too much water.' Three liters, though, is not enough to do any damage. 'For an average man, . three liters is about what's recommended,' he said. 'I drink that in a day, but I . do it by listening to my body.' 'If you don't drink enough water,  you get dehydrated, your skin's going to look bad and . you'll feel terrible' The important thing, says Dr Besser, is to find the right balance and not go to either extreme. 'If you don't drink enough water, . that's not good,' he said. 'You get dehydrated, your skin's going to look bad and . you'll feel terrible.' It's not the first time a woman has shared her success story after increasing her water intake. In October, 42-year-old Sara Smith revealed to MailOnline how drinking three liters of water a day made her look ten years younger.

"By . Sarah Dean . The South Korean family of the 2013 X Factor Australia winner has completed the almost impossible task of crossing the restricted North Korean border. In tense footage, singer Dami Im, 25, is seen returning to the country her grandfather, Suk Young Lee, came from but was never allowed to return home to after war broke out in 1950. There was high drama at the most heavily armed border in the world as North Korean soldiers spotted the Im family and popstar Dannii Minogue crossing into North Korean land at the Joint Security Area. Emotional moments: Dannii Minogue learned about the secret that tore Dami Im's family apart during a Channel Seven Sunday Night documentary . The JSA is the only portion of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) where South and North Korean forces stand face-to-face. In the Channel Seven Sunday Night TV special called 'Dami Im: Finding my family', viewers learned how Ms Im's grandfather, Mr Lee, came to South Korea from North Korea for a brief trip in his twenties. He was never able to return to his home and family when the war which divided Korea into two countries broke out. Stranded in the south, he met Bong-Hee-Moon, Dami's grandmother.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Russia and China have united to block a UN investigation into Assad's war crimes in Syria. The two countries today vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution referring the Syrian crisis to the International Criminal Court for investigation of possible war crimes. This is the fourth time they have used their veto power as permanent council members to deflect action against the government of President Bashar Assad. More than 60 countries gave their support to the French-drafted resolution in a dramatic move to demand a path to justice in the conflict - which has now entered its fourth year. Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin votes against a U.N. Security Council vote which would have referred the Syrian crisis to the International Criminal Court (ICC) The resolution would have referred Syria's crisis to the world's permanent war crimes tribunal without specifically targeting either the government or the opposition. Before the vote, U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson pleaded with council members to find unity and 'put an end to this long nightmare.' French Ambassador Gerard Araud warned: 'A veto would cover up all crimes. It would be vetoing justice.' But Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin walked into the council meeting with a smile, telling reporters: 'I'm going to be boringly predictable.' He earlier had called the resolution a 'publicity stunt' that would hurt efforts to find a political solution to a crisis that activists say has killed more than 160,000 and sent millions fleeing. U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power had her speech ready for the promised veto. 'Sadly, because of the decision of the Russian Federation to back the Syrian regime no matter what it does, the Syrian people will not see justice,' she said. The Russian ambassador (top left) raises his hand, as doesChina's deputy U.N. Ambassador Wang Min in the vote which took place today. It is the fourth time the two countries have blocked action against President Assad . Other members of the U.N. Security Council raise their hands voting for a referral to the International Criminal Court. More than 60 countries supported the French-drafted resolution . She added, 'There should be accountability for those members of the council who prevented accountability.' The . draft resolution condemned the 'widespread violation' of human rights . and international humanitarian law by Syrian authorities and . pro-government militias as well as abuses and violations by 'non-state . armed groups' during the last three years. British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said: 'It is to Russia and China's shame that they have chosen to block efforts to achieve justice for the Syrian people. 'And it is disgraceful that they have yet again vetoed the Security Council's efforts to take action in response to the appalling human rights violations being committed every day in Syria.' Rwandan Ambassador Eugene Richard Gasana said: 'This council cannot be inured to mass tragedies.' The Security Council has been deeply divided over Syria, with Syrian allies Russia and China at odds with the U.S., its Western allies and other members who support the opposition. Frustration has soared as the international community struggles to find a solution to the war, deliver humanitarian aid to almost 3.5 million Syrians in need and end impunity for horrific crimes. Attempts at peace talks are at a standstill, leading the joint U.N.-Arab league envoy who tried to broker them to resign. 'Russia and China's vote for continued impunity is a disgrace of historic proportion,' said Richard Dicker, director of international justice at Human Rights Watch. The opposition Syrian Coalition called the vetoes a 'disgrace.' Samantha Power, ambassador to the United States, speaks during the meeting. She told the council: 'There should be accountability for those members of the council who prevented accountability . The dozens of co-sponsors to the latest failed Security Council resolution said they wanted to send 'a strong political signal ... that impunity for the most serious crimes under international law is unacceptable.' Syria is not a party to the Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court, so the only way it can be referred to The Hague, Netherlands-based tribunal is by the Security Council. Syria's U.N. Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari sent a letter Tuesday asking countries not to support the resolution. A copy of the letter, obtained by The Associated Press, calls the proposal 'biased' and an effort to 'sabotage any chance of peaceful settlement of the Syrian crisis led by the Syrian people themselves.' The Security Council has managed twice to reach agreement on a Syria resolution, once to get rid of its chemical weapons and earlier this year to demand access for the delivery of humanitarian aid. The resolution on aid has largely failed. Syrian activist Quasi Zakarya, center, stands at the request of U.S. Ambassador Samantha Powers as she addressed the council.

"By . Joel Christie . A Los Angeles toddler who developed huge life-threatening tumors pressing against his neck and chest while in the womb is now living life as a regular child after undergoing a rare and extremely risky delivery procedure. Second-time mom Britnie Sanchez was 34 weeks pregnant when she was told her son - who her and husband Chris named Blake - had masses on his tiny body that were 'like airplane pillows but cut in half and then under his arm'. While the tumors were likely blocking Blake's airway passages, he remained protected in utero because his blood was oxygenated through the umbilical cord. But, once delivered, doctors did not believe Blake would be capable of breathing on his own. Success: Little Blake Sanchez underwent a life-saving surgery seconds after being born with his umbilical cord still attached to remove tumors on his neck and chest, which would have prevented him breathing . To save Blake, doctors performed a rare and risky surgery during the delivery called the EXIT procedure, which involves operating on the infant when they are out of the uterus but before the umbilical cord has been clamped . Happy mom: Britnie Sanchez was not able to hold her son Blake until he was two-months-old . 'I couldn't stop crying,' Sanchez told ABC News of receiving the news. 'I would just sit in our nursery and cry. (But) I knew when he was in me, he was safe.' In order to save Blake, doctors prepared to perform a unique surgery known as the EXIT procedure, standing for Ex-Utero Intrapartum Treatment, whereby the infant is operated on as soon as they are out of the uterus but before the umbilical cord has been clamped. Dr. Esther Friedrich, a perinatologist at the Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center who treated Sanchez, said there were serious risks involved in the surgery. 'When you look at the literature in every single case, the mortality is high,' said Dr. Friedrich. More than 40 medical personnel used two operating rooms to practice the procedure. Sanchez said she spent the weeks leading up to the surgery in 'depressed mode', but calmed down after talking to Dr. Frederich. 'You're going to wake up to beautiful baby boy,' Sanchez recalled Dr. Frederich telling her as she entered the operating room. 'Don't be sad, this is a not a day to be sad. This is a day to be happy.' Despite the tracheotomy tube and ventilator, Blake continued to grow and develop happy and healthily, his parents said . Then, just nine days before his first birthday, Blake ripped out his tube one night and, surprisingly, was able to breath on his own perfectly fine . Once Sanchez was under anesthesia, doctors had to figure out how to keep her body from naturally going into delivery, which could compromise Blake's health if doctors had not established an airway in time. To trick her body, doctors flushed warm saline in Sanchez's uterus. Frederich said doctors partially delivered Blake, gave him a sedative and then intubated him to establish an airway in about 15 minutes. They then delivered Blake and cut the umbilical cord normally before whisking him to the neonatal intensive care unit. 'All I remember [after the surgery] is seeing my husband and asking if my baby was here,' Sanchez said. '[He said] he's here and he's beautiful and he's doing great.' Although doctors were able to establish an airway, Blake wasn't given the all-clear. The large tumors were not cancerous, but they were filled with fluid that could not be easily drained and were pressing on his lungs. It took nearly three months before doctors were able to try an experimental medication that could diminish the tumors. Sanchez and her husband weren't able to hold their son until he was two months old. For his first birthday, Blake Sanchez got to go home with mom Britnie and dad Chris without being attached to a ventilator for the first time in his life . Blake Sanchez now looks like any other toddler, save for a small amount of excess skin at the bottom of his face and top of his neck . At three months, the Sanchez family were finally able to take Blake home, although the infant had a tracheotomy tube that required he be on a ventilator at all times. Then nine days before his first birthday, Blake pulled out his tracheotomy tube in the middle of the night, potentially leaving him unable to breathe. Sanchez said she almost panicked and called 911, but resisted because Blake appeared to be fine. After ending up back at the Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center, doctors decided not to put the tracheotomy back in since the tracheotomy hole had nearly closed and Blake was breathing fine on his own. For his first birthday, Blake got to go home without being attached to a ventilator for the first time in his life. 'This kid goes to the beat of his own drum,' Sanchez said. All smiles: In a few months Blake will turn two, having come a long way from his initial prognosis . 'He's a little miracle and we [couldn't] believe that for his first birthday he's running around talking.' Earlier this month, the Sanchez family reunited with some of the doctors and nurses that helped deliver and treat Blake as a newborn. Dr. Frederich said that seeing Blake recovery was remarkable knowing how extensive his tumors were at birth. 'You totally wouldn't be able to tell if you saw him,' she said. 'Seeing him grow through that whole procedure and treatment afterwards ... It's awesome. It really exemplifies why we're doing this.'","Doctors discovered tumors pressing against the neck and chest of Blake Sanchez while he was in utero .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Police in South Carolina say nine students - aged 16 through 19 - have been arrested after they were caught on surveillance video throwing rocks and food at passing cars while on their school bus. According to an incident report, Durham Bus Services notified Septima Clark Academy, an alternative high school program, that several students on bus 529 threw items at a passing vehicles on May 8, causing damage to a truck. Officers arrived on the scene to find a dent on victim's passenger side roof and window area and 'food splashed across the grill, hood, and windshield', according to WCSC. Video of the incident, taken from the security camera inside the bus, has now been released. Scroll down for video . Caught: Security footage taken within the South Carolina school bus was used by police to identify the students involved in throwing rocks and food out the windows . Charged as adults: (Top row) Akeele Simmons, Anton Simmons, Domonique Smith, Jordan Jasper and (bottom row) Kayla Gilliard, Maurice Deveaux, Roberta Ravenell and Shalaine Jenkins face a combined total of 16 warrants . The footage was used by officers to identify those involved. The report states 17-year-old Kayla Gilliard was spotted getting on the bus with a 'pizza box full of rocks', while a 16-year-old female student brought a 'bag of food items'. Multiple students on the bus then reportedly began to yell profanities at their 78-year-old bus driver as he tried to give them instructions. The 16-year-old student is allegedly heard on video saying she was going to 'chop some cars'. Surveillance footage then shows 17-year-old Akeele Simmons use Wite-Out correction fluid to cover the lens of one of the bus' three security cameras. Authorities say one of the students threw a large rock out the window, hitting the victim's truck. The victim then tried to get the bus to pull over. When the bus driver tried to call in his location on the radio, another student, 19-year-old Shalaine Jenkins, is spotted on camera attempting to take the radio from him before eventually returning to her seat. The 16-year-old student then reportedly threw coleslaw at the victim's truck as he was passing the bus, while a second student threw another rock at the vehicle. Nine teenagers are accused of smuggling rocks onto their school bus and then hurtling them out the windows at other cars in Charleston .

"By . Martin Beckford . and John Dickens . Two five-year-old boys have been investigated by police over alleged rapes of other children. The boys were contacted by officers in Thames Valley Police last year following reports of sexual assaults on the other youngsters. But no action could be taken against them as they are deemed too young to know right from wrong, and the suspected rapes were not added to crime figures. Details of the cases are not clear but the boys’ parents would have been contacted and police may also have asked social workers to help. Corrupting: Easy access to the internet can warp a child's views on what's normal, causing misery for their victims. In total 235 children were identified as suspects in sexual assaults between 2011 and 2013 . The alleged sex attacks emerged in official figures uncovered by The Mail on Sunday. The shocking statistics also reveal that a six-year-old girl has also been reported to police over suspected sex offences, as have boys aged just four. Police have investigated more than 200 reports of sexual activity and assault by children under ten years old in recent years. Last night experts warned that some of the young offenders may have been acting out obscene material they had seen on the internet at home or on mobile phones in the school playground. A five-year-old boy was suspected of possessing pornographic images, the figures show. ‘Exposure to extreme, sometimes sexually violent and degrading material is now only a few clicks away,’ says Jon Brown of the NSPCC. ‘This can warp youngster’s views of what is normal and acceptable sexual behaviour, how they treat others and how they expect to be treated. ‘We know that technology and easy access to sexual material is affecting young people’s views of what is “normal” or acceptable behaviour.’ Children aged nine or younger cannot be prosecuted in England and Wales as they are below the age of criminal responsibility. But if police are told that a child has committed an offence, officers will still investigate and many forces still record the incidents in crime logs. The alleged crime will remain undetected, with ‘no further action’ officially taken against the suspect. However, forces will refer serious cases to social services as well as interviewing the victim and perpetrator, and their parents. For the first time, new ‘restorative justice’ and ‘community resolution’ schemes are being used to deal with very young offenders. These can involve children meeting their victims to say sorry for what they have done. Youth: The shocking statistics also reveal that a six-year-old girl has also been reported to police over suspected sex offences, as have boys aged just four (file image) Chief Superintendent Lee Bruckshaw, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘Only in the most serious and extreme cases would such a young person be brought into a police station. Instead, if we identify that a person responsible for a crime is under the age of ten we will work closely with the parents or guardians to address the cause of the offending, rather than criminalising the individual.’ Figures obtained by this newspaper using Freedom of Information laws reveal that 16 of the 43 forces in England and Wales have recorded under tens as suspects for alleged sex crimes between 2011 and 2013. In total 235 children have been identified as suspects. The highest numbers were seen in Thames Valley, which covers Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire. The force recorded 28 alleged rapes and 76 other sex offences allegedly committed by under tens, although its figures covered five years from 2009 to 2013. Last year two five-year-old boys were suspected of rape, although these reports were later logged as ‘crime related incidents’ rather than crimes. This could mean the alleged victims did not provide full details to police or another force took over the case. The identical entries on the police spreadsheet simply state: ‘Crime related incident. Rape’ then ‘M’ for male suspect and ‘5’ for age at the time of the alleged offence. They do not make clear if the incidents were related. A six-year-old girl was also suspected of rape by the force in 2009, and another girl of the same age was reported for ‘non-rape sexual offences’ in 2013. Under a change to the law a decade ago, rape can now be carried out by males or females and can include penetration with a finger or object of the body of someone who does not, or cannot, consent. Separate records show that in 2012-13, a four-year-old in High Wycombe was reported for ‘sexual assault on a male child under 13’ and another child of the same age was reported for ‘sexual activity involving a child under 13’. Thames Valley was unable to provide further details of the offences but said that all allegations were investigated fully and other agencies such as social services would be notified if necessary. In Sussex, a five-year-old boy was recorded as possessing ‘obscene publications and protected sexual material’, and an eight-year-old boy suspected of ‘familial sex offences’. Jim Gamble, a child safety expert, said: ‘I’m not surprised but it’s still shocking when children become involved in these sorts of offences.’ He said they are becoming sexualised ever earlier by seeing adult material on TV, on the internet and smart phones. As a result, parents must have important discussions with them about sex at younger ages. ‘Some don’t want their children to hear that but there’s a real need for early education.’","Two boys were investigated by police over alleged rapes of other children .

"By . Wills Robinson . Annabel Karmel, 57, has suffered 'sleepless nights' during the year-long ordeal, her partner of eight years has revealed . The partner of celebrity chef Annabel Karmel has revealed her 'nightmare' after an employee she sacked accused her of sexual misconduct. The 57-year-old, who writes books on children’s food, was alleged to have made sexual comments to Mark Salter, 39, in a bid to seduce him. But he withdrew his claims as part of an undisclosed settlement between the two parties before an employment tribunal was due to start in London. Stephen Margolis, her partner for eight years said, says the ordeal has devastated the family and, because of the agreement, she cannot tell her side of the story. 'It has been awful what Annabel has gone through. It has gone on for a year. 'She has suffered sleepless nights,' he told the Sunday Telegraph. 'It has been devastating. It has had a huge effect on the whole household.' The film financier and lawyer said there was 'no evidence' to substantiate the claim, but it leaked to the press before the accusations were retracted. Mrs Karmel had tried . to keep the hearing secret, obtaining a gagging order preventing . publication of her name, her company’s name and the name of her former . employee. It has been . reported that Mr Salter claimed the celebrity author ‘only employed . good-looking men’ and made inappropriate comments about his good looks . in front of clients. However, . an investigation by the paper has revealed that he sued a previous . employer after claiming that he had hurt his back lifting equipment. Her legal team . argued that her reputation and status as a ‘well-known media . personality’ would be irreparably damaged regardless of the outcome of . the case because it involved an  allegation of sexual misconduct. Mrs Karmel was taken to a tribunal by an employee she sacked, but he retracted the claims after the two parties came to an agreement . After reaching the settlement, Mrs Karmel said: 'He withdrew his claim of sexual . misconduct as part of an undisclosed settlement. In a statement issued . through her lawyers. 'I have defended . his claim throughout and am glad this has now been resolved. It has . been agreed that neither party will make any further comment on this . matter.’ The . food guru has published 37 books, is regularly on television, radio and . in the Press and her business has expanded to include baby products and . ready meals. Mrs Karmel says she was inspired to create healthy meals . following the death of her first child, Natasha, and because of her son . Nicholas’s fussy eating habits. She has two other grown-up children. Divorced . from their father, oil broker Simon Karmel, she lives in a £20million . home in one of London’s most sought-after districts with film producer . partner Stephen Margolis.

"By . Mia De Graaf . The family of the Cheeki Rafiki's skipper are 'shocked and deeply saddened' after the search for the four missing sailors was called off. The . U.S. Coastguard dramatically revealed at 2am today that the life raft . had been found undeployed inside the upturned hull of the yacht, which . was found adrift last night. The . revelation effectively ended any last hopes that the four . men on board the boat might have somehow survived. Andrew Bridge, 22 (left), was sailing home with James Male, 23 (right), from Antigua when they hit rough seas . Also on board were Paul Goslin, 56 (left), and Steve Warren, 52 (right), who had planned to sail a different ship . Tragically, . it has emerged that two of the sailors were originally due to embark on . a different boat, before switching to the Cheeki Rafiki at the last . minute. Relatives of skipper Andrew Bridge, 22, said: 'We are obviously shocked and deeply saddened by the news. 'Andrew will be dearly missed by everyone who knew him.' Mr Bridge had been competing at a regatta in Antigua with James Male, 23, Steve . Warren, 52, and Paul Goslin, 56. Mr Warren and Mr Goslin had been due to sail a different ship but changed at the last minute. Mr Goslin's family said that he was 'fulfilling one of his lifelong dreams' by sailing across the Atlantic. A statement read: 'As you can imagine we were deeply saddened by the news on Friday night and are struggling to come to terms with the fact that Paul, our wonderful husband, son, father, grandfather, won't be found alive and returned home to us. The last picture of the crew of the Cheeki Rafiki: Pictured are Andrew Bridge (front left), James Male (front right), Paul Goslin (centre back in stripes) and Steve Warren (behind Paul Goslin) Hopes ended: In this photo provided by the United States Navy, the overturned hull of the Cheeki Rafiki is seen 1,000 miles east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The crew never managed to launch their life raft . 'Paul was deeply loving and exceptionally intelligent and we know will be missed by everyone that knew him. 'Paul . had been a passionate sailor for many years and loved everything to do . with the water. He'd been talking about sailing across the Atlantic for . many years. 'We are, therefore, trying to take some comfort in the knowledge that he was fulfilling one of his lifelong dreams.' Relatives of yachtsman James Male, aged 23 years, said: 'As you can imagine we are deeply saddened by Friday's news and struggling to come to terms with the fact that James is missing. 'James was a passionate sailor, surfer, kayaker and all round water sport enthusiast as well as being a keen snowboarder and outdoor instructor. Damage: Navy crews observed that the sailing vessel's windows were smashed and the keel broken off, causing a breach in the hull . 'He loved being in the outdoors and on the water teaching new skills to people. 'We must therefore try to take some comfort in the knowledge that he was doing something he really loved.' The family's statement, released via the Foreign Office, added: 'The past week has been a very difficult one for all the families and we have drawn strength from each other and hopefully we can continue to do so. 'James would have been amazed by the overwhelming support shown to us all by the public, which has made this week slightly easier to bear. 'We would like to thank everyone who helped us in our search. Special thanks must go to the US and Canadian Coast Guards, the US Navy, the RAF, the merchant vessels and smaller yachts that sailed through the area. 'We must also thank the UK Government, the support the Foreign Office has provided us with in the past week has been second to none. 'This has been very comforting and we could not have done without it.' On their way back to England last . Thursday, the crew hit extreme sea conditions and radioed that their . yacht was taking on water. After . closing the search with no findings last week, US authorities caved to . pressure from the families of the four men to continue on Tuesday. Distressing: The revelation that the lifeboat was not deployed effectively ends any last hopes of the families of the four men on board the boat that they might have somehow survived. A U.S. Navy warship helicopter spotted the flooded hull - with its windows smashed - 1,000 miles off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. There was initially no sign of the life raft but today's discovery brought the rescue efforts to a close. Mr Warren's uncle, Albert Davey, told the . BBC: 'It's not the ending we would want but we have got to gain some . small consolation that Steve was doing what he thoroughly enjoyed doing . and I think we have got to cling on to that.' Paying tribute to the yachtsmen, David Cameron tweeted: 'My thoughts are with the families of the . crew of the Cheeky Rafiki after the sad news its hull has been found . with the life-raft unused.' Foreign . Secretary William Hague said: 'It is very sad news. It was an awful . moment yesterday to discover the life raft was still there in the boat.' Early this morning, the U.S. Coast Guard released a new . statement, saying: ‘The U.S. Coast Guard has confirmed the . life raft aboard the capsized sailing vessel Cheeki Rafiki was secured . in its storage space in the aft portion of the boat, Friday, indicating . it was not used for emergency purposes. Same again: Officials claim today's sighting was of the same overturned hull spotted on Saturday (pictured) by a cargo vessel 1,000 miles east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts . The hull, which crew on the MV Maersk Kure container ship photographed, has tonight been identified as the Cheeki Rafiki, the Foreign Office has revealed . ‘A U.S. Navy warship smallboat crew . and surface swimmer captured underwater imagery clearly identifying the . raft in its storage space. The image was shared with and acknowledged by . the families.’ Britain's Foreign Office said it has . decided to recall a Royal Air Force plane which had been due to search . for the Cheeki Rafiki's four missing crew for one more day, after the . U.S. Coast Guard also called off its search. Mr . Warren's family, who have now requested privacy, added in a statement: . 'We are very sad that the US has now suspended the search.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A traffic warden has been caught on film apparently refusing to ticket a car parked on double yellow lines - and eventually admits that it's because it belongs to his own boss. The warden, who was on patrol in Swansea, South Wales, was confronted by an indignant member of the public who noticed that one car had escaped punishment. Steve McMillan, who filmed the encounter on his phone, asked the warden repeatedly why he had refused to ticket the car, to which the flustered official replied that he was acting on his 'discretion'. Scroll down for video . 'My discretion': A parking attendant in Swansea is confronted over his decision not to ticket a car - and it eventually emerges it belongs to his boss . When pressed on the matter by Mr McMillan - who insisted he had no such right to refuse the ticket - the warden insisted that he did. Eventually another warden entered the fray, and revealed another reason the ticket was allegedly withheld, saying 'That's my boss's car'. A second video filmed by Mr McMillan then shows the man in question - Swansea Parking Services Deputy Manager Steve Sheriff - entering the argument. 'On business': A second warden, left, later points out that the car belongs to his boss Steve Sheriff, right, who then arrives and attempts to defend himself . The suited man - who identifies himself as Mr Sheriff when asked - attempts to explain that he is parking there for business reasons, which Mr McMillan tells him is not a valid reason. He initially compares himself to the police - who are allowed to disregard parking laws in certain circumstances - but later gives up on the line of argument. When asked whether his logic applied to anybody who has business reasons for parking on double yellow lines, Mr Sheriff does not give a clear answer, but seems to leave the confrontation seemingly without a ticket. Swansea City Council was not available to comment. PART ONE: CONFRONTATION AND WRIGGLING FROM THE PARKING ATTENDANT . Steve McMillan: How come you just allowed somebody to park on double yellow lines? Warden 1: I've got discretion... That's for me to know... it's privileged information, sir.. I'm allowed to give discretion for people. Mr McMillan: I disagree, sir, because that's not fair... We're all equal people, you have no right to leave that vehicle parked there. PART TWO: THE TRUTH EMERGES . Mr McMillan: I'm just asking the question - how come you've allowed that car to park there for more than five minutes on double yellows and then walked away from the situation? Warden 2: What? That car there? That's my boss's car. Mr McMillan: It doesn't matter whether it's your boss's car, does it? Warden 2: I think you'd better go speak to him yourself, sir. PART THREE: 'I'M ON BUSINESS' Mr McMillan: How come you're allowed to park on double yellow lines for more than five minutes? Mr Sheriff: I'm actually on business at the moment. Mr McMillan: That doesn't matter... Why is it fair for you to park on business and not me? Mr Sheriff: It depends on what you're doing. Mr McMillan: But no, it doesn't. PART FOUR: THE ADMISSION . Mr Sheriff: All right, I shouldn't have really parked there. Mr McMillan: I just don't think that's fair. PART FIVE: THE LAST-DITCH ATTEMPT . Warden 1: I'm using my discretion. Mr McMillan: You're not a police officer, sir, you have a job to follow and if you're not doing it and booking this car you're in breach of your own rules and regulations. PART SIX: THE COUP DE GRACE . Mr McMillan: Police have discretion, they are allowed to park on double yellow lines if they have blue lights on. Do you have blue lights on top of this vehicle? Mr Sheriff: No. Mr McMillan: Are you a police officer? Mr Sheriff: No. Mr McMillan: You're a manager who's high up within the parking industry.

"By . Ryan Lipman . An Australian man has unveiled a dinosaur fossil he claims tells the Bible's story and also proves humans lived alongside the extinct creatures just a few thousand years ago. Ken Ham, who founded the Creation Museum in the U.S. and is building a $80 million Noah's ark, showed the remains of the nine-metre long Allosaurus skeleton called Ebenezer on Saturday. Resembling a Tyrannosaurus rex, the fossil is featured in a new exhibit called Facing the Allosaurus. Ken Ham claims dinosaurs and humans lived together just a few thousand years ago, based on an Allosaurus fossil. The Creation Museum features displays, pictured, of humans with dinosaurs . Answers in Genesis, the Christian ministry that owns the Creation Museum, states about 50 per cent of the skeleton's bones were found in Colorado more than a 10 years ago. The museum claims the dinosaur died in a worldwide flood about 4,300 years ago, while scientists say the last dinosaurs roamed the earth more than 60 million years ago. Mr Ham said the display will help defend the book of Genesis and expose the scientific problems with evolution, reported Ninemsn. 'Evolutionists use dinosaurs to reach children more than anything to promote their worldview,' Ham said. 'Our museum uses dinosaurs to help tell their true history according to the Bible.' Head-to-head: Ken Ham, pictured left, debated science educator Bill Nye, pictured right, at the museum in February. Mr Nye challenged the Bible's story on a world flood and how animals would have reacted . Mr Ham, a former Queensland science teacher, garnered intense media attention after discussing a worldwide flood, as documented in the Old Testament, in a debate with science educator Bill Nye at the Creation Museum in February. Watched by millions of people via live web stream, Mr Nye challenged the Biblical story when he described how animals would have behaved in such a flood. '(If) there was a big flood on the earth, you would expect drowning animals to swim up to a higher level,' he said. This would have allowed their bones to be mix with fossils from later time periods and Mr Nye used the Grand Canyon as an example. 'Not any one of them did, not a single one,' he said. With a strong emphasis on the Bible, the Creation Museum features many Biblical displays . Kentucky Paleontological Society president Daniel Phelps said via release on Thursday, the Creation Museum has decided without doing research, that the dinosaur fossil is evidence of Noah's flood. The Elizabeth Streb Peroutka Foundation, which purchased the bones more than a decade ago, donated the Allosaurus to the museum. Member of the foundation Michael Peroutka, who was also the Constitution Party's presidential candidate in 2004, said the fossil is a testimony to the creative power of God in designing dinosaurs. He also added that it was evidence to the truth of a worldwide catastrophic flooding of the earth in Noah's time. Mark Clementz, a paleontologist at the University of Wyoming said the Allosaurus was a large carnivore that lived in North America in the late Jurassic period about 150 million years ago.","Australian Ken Ham has unveiled a dinosaur fossil at the Creation Museum in the U.S.

The attack occurred at 7.50am local time in the city of Urumqi, the capital of the volatile Xinjiang region, and has been described as a 'serious violent terrorist incident' by China's Ministry of Public Security .

'The air was full of the smell of gunpowder and the sound of . sobbing,' he said. 'There were simply too many (casualties), old folks . who were at the morning market.' A business owner told Xinhua he had heard a dozen loud explosions at the market near Renmin Park in downtown Urumqi. A blast has rocked the capital of China's western region of Xinjiang, after explosives were hurled from two vehicles, killing and injuring at least 31 people .

A timeline of recent violent incidents linked to tensions in China's far northwestern region of Xinjiang between its native Turkic Muslim Uighur ethnic group and China's majority Han. China tightly controls information about such incidents, and it's not always clear what transpired or the exact number of victims and attackers killed. Aug. 4, 2008: Two Uighur men steal a dump truck and drive it into a group of policemen in the far western city of Kashgar, killing 16 people. The attack comes just days ahead of the opening of the Beijing Olympics, fulfilling expectations that extremists would attempt to disrupt the games. July 5-7, 2009: Violence breaks out between police and protesting Uighurs in central Urumqi, then spreads through much of the city. A total of 197 people are killed, most of them Han Chinese, in the worst bloodshed in Xinjiang in decades. July 18, 2011: A group of young Uighur men attack government offices and a police station outside the city of Hotan in southern Xinjiang, killing two officers and two hostages. Of the 18 attackers, 14 are shot dead. April 24, 2013: Gang members stab and burn neighborhood security patrol officers and then police in a village outside Kashgar, killing 21 officers and local government officials. June 26, 2013: Assailants raid police and government offices in the eastern Xinjiang town of Lukqun, killing 24 officers and civilians. Police say the attackers belonged to a 17-member extremist Islamic cell. Oct. 28, 2013: A jeep carrying a Uighur man, his wife and her mother jumps a curb in downtown Beijing and plows through tourists before coming to a stop in front of Tiananmen Gate and exploding into flames. Five people are killed, including those in the vehicle and two tourists, in the first such incident known to have taken place in the capital. March 1, 2014: Five knife-wielding men and women slash at people at the railway station in the southwestern city of Kunming in Yunnan province, killing 29. The attack is the biggest ever outside Xinjiang, and results in stepped-up security nationwide. April 30, 2014: Two suspected suicide bombers detonate their explosives at the exit to the Urumqi train station, killing themselves and one other person. Another eight people attack passengers with knives, leaving a total of 79 injured. May 22, 2014: Two trucks plow through crowds at an open air market in Urumqi as explosives are tossed from their windows. Thirty-one people are killed and 94 injured, the largest number of victims in a single incident of violence involving Xinjiang tensions in recent history.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Monica Lewinsky has made it clear that she meant it when she announced that she will no longer live in hiding as she walked the red carpet at a Manhattan gala Thursday night. Bill Clinton's former mistress broke her decades-long silence earlier this month by writing a tell-all essay for Vanity Fair and on Thursday she showed that she has no intention of stopping there. Lewinsky, 40, attended the Kitchen Spring Gala Benefit with David Friend, a longtime confidante an the editor of creative development for Vanity Fair who convinced her to write the essay. Monica Lewinsky attended a gala in Manhattan on Thursday night, her first public appearance in more than a decade . All smiles: The event was held in honor of a famed sculptor and was raising money for an art space in New York . Covered up: Rather than the white sheath she wore in the Vanity Fair spread, Lewinsky opted for a pink dress with a sheer black overlay with short lacy sleeves . She was wearing a rose-colored dress with a sheer black overlay that had short lacy sleeves covering part of her arms. The benefit, held at Cipriani Wall Street, raised funds for one of the city's oldest non-profit spaces founded and used by artistic communities. 'People were surprised to see her there... there were a lot of double takes,' an attendee told The New York Post. Though Lewinsky alluded to boyfriends during her years hiding from the spotlight, Friend is not one of them as he is married to children's book publisher Nancy Paulsen and they have two children. Connections: Friend, who is married to a children's book publisher, was the one to convince Lewinsky to write a tell-all essay for Vanity Fair earlier this month . Thursday's event was slated as an evening to honor sculptor Robert Longo, and Lewinsky reportedly wanted to attend because she is a fan of Longo's work. 'She saw some of my stuff when she was a . teenager. She’s very sweet. I think she’s a courageous woman. She’s very . smart, very cool to talk to,' Longo told the paper, explaining that it . was the first time he had met Lewinsky. 'People were surprised to see her there... there were a lot of double takes' -an unidentified attendee . 'I told her I read that thing she wrote recently,       I told her, ""I think you’re a pretty courageous woman.""’ Longo was not the only artist that Lewinsky chatted with over the course of the evening. The Post also reported that she spent time talking with artist Cindy Sherman and actor John Turturro who were the two co-hosts of the event. In the Vanity Fair essay, Lewinsky wrote about how she has spent much of the past decade hidden because she fears that any move she makes will be played into Bill and Hillary Clinton's political narrative- one which shows no signs of slowing down since she is the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in 2016. Moving on: Monica Lewinsky has purposefully kept a private life in the wake of the scandal but now feels she can be an advocate for those who have the internet partially to blame for their problems (pictured in October 2012) That embrace: Lewinsky maintains that she had a consensual relationship with then-President Clinton but felt used later by prosecutors and investigators . 'When I hear of Hillary's prospective candidacy, I cannot help but fear the next wave of paparazzi, the next wave of ""Where is she now?"" stories, the next reference to me in Fox News's coverage of the primaries. I've begun to find it debilitating to plot out the cycle of my life, to some degree, on the political calendar,' she wrote. It comes as little surprise that her first public appearance was at a charity event, since Lewinsky stated in the Vanity Fair piece that she hopes to use her name to help those who have been the victims of online bullying. 'Thanks to the Drudge Report, I was also possibly the first person whose global humiliation was driven by the Internet.' She views the Vanity Fair piece as a sign that she is ready to stop 'tiptoeing around my past- and other people's futures. I am determined to have a different ending to my story.' 'I've decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past. (What this will cost me, I will soon find out.)'","Monica Lewinsky attended a gala in Manhattan Thursday night .

"Schoolchildren are being taken to a jail whose inmates include rapists and murderers to deter them from a life of crime. Wiltshire Police are organising the trips to Erlestoke Prison, near Devizes, where local pupils aged 15 and 16 are shown cells and given a talk by inmates. A deputy headmaster who accompanied three children to the prison earlier this month said: ‘This kind of experience teaches them about the consequences of breaking the law.’ Wiltshire Police are organising the trips to Erlestoke Prison, near Devizes, where local pupils aged 15 and 16 are shown cells and given a talk by inmates . Richard Thomson, from Notton House School in Chippenham, said that although his school catered for boys with emotional and behavioural problems, the pupils on the trip were studying justice systems and had never been in trouble with the law. Nonetheless, he said the talk by the inmates had been ‘a salutary lesson for the boys’. A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘This is a police initiative aimed at reducing crime among young people. The young people do not come into contact with the general prison population.

"By . Richard Spillett . Rolf Harris arriving at Southwark Crown Court this morning, where he denies 12 counts of indecent assault . There is 'no independent evidence' that proves Rolf Harris was at events where he allegedly groped two women, a court has heard. Jurors at Southwark Crown Court were told that despite searches of newspaper archives, no trace of the entertainer having appeared at a community centre near Portsmouth in 1969 or an event in Cambridge in 1975 could be found. One alleged victim, then aged 14, claims Harris, 84, groped her bottom outside a Celebrity It's a Knock Out event in Cambridge. She said he was acting up for a crowd by barking at a dog before he grabbed her. Sonia Woodley QC, defending Harris, told senior investigating officer Gary Pankhurst: 'There is no independent evidence of any kind to put Mr Harris in Cambridge in the year of 1975.' The detective sergeant said that the alleged victim had not been entirely sure of the date, but '1975 was clearly she felt the most certain'. Another woman claimed Harris touched her intimately when she was seven or eight after she queued to get his autograph at a community centre near Portsmouth in 1969. Again, despite searches of local newspaper archives, council records and letter drops appealing for witnesses, no confirmation could be found that Harris had been there. This included looking at copies of the Portsmouth News between January 1967 and May 1974, the court heard. When the allegation was put to Harris, he told police: 'I would simply never touch a child inappropriately.' The artist and entertainer is accused of 12 counts of indecent assault on four alleged victims between 1968 and 1986, all of which he denies. Mr Pankhurst, from sex crime inquiry Operation Yewtree, was taken through parts of the prosecution evidence this morning. He confirmed that three weeks after the inquiry was launched in October 2012, officers received a referral from the NSPCC. A counsellor claimed that they had been dealing with someone since 1998 who had alleged they had been abused by Harris as a child. Harris arrived at court with his daughter Bindi (left) and niece Jenny (right) ahead of today's hearing . The next day, October 25 2012, the woman herself came forward, but only agreed later to give officers her name. The following month Harris's Bray home was searched by police while he was out of the country, but his daughter Bindi was present. They seized exhibits and Harris agreed voluntarily to speak to police. In his first interview he gave a prepared statement about Bindi's friend that said: 'I categorically deny having had any sexual contact with the complainant whatsoever while she was under the age of 16. 'The allegations she has made have . shocked and distressed me. They are absolutely without foundation and I . deny them in the strongest possible terms.' Rolf Harris in police interview . 'I accept that I did have a consensual sexual relationship with the complainant when she was an adult. I finished the relationship and she was extremely upset.' He accepted writing to the alleged victim's father begging for forgiveness, adding: 'I express my genuine regret as to one; that I had an affair as a married man which I know to be wrong, and two; that the complainant was upset by my actions, and I was very sorry if I had done anything to upset her.' The alleged victim did not make her claims public and the first time they were made publicly known was at the opening of Harris's trial, the court heard. Another alleged victim, Tonya Lee, who has waived the normal right to anonymity in sex cases, was interviewed by British police in Australia. They spoke to her separately from her boyfriend Fian McDaid, because he was 'controlling', the court heard. Mr Pankhurst said: 'He was very suspicious of us and appeared to want to manage the whole situation.' Ms Lee gave a magazine and a television interview to Australian media in return for a fee, the court heard, leading Harris to question her motive for coming forward. A jury at Southwark Crown Court heard there was 'no independent evidence' to prove Harris was at events where his alleged offences took place . He said in a police statement: 'The allegations she has made have shocked and distressed me. They are absolutely without foundation and I deny them in the strongest possible terms.' The entertainer went on: 'I'm afraid that her actions do suggest that she may be motivated by a desire for fame and financial reward.' Later McDaid, who served a jail term for assaulting Lee, claimed that she had invented her allegations, the court heard. The two remaining victims came forward before Ms Lee's media interviews were made public, jurors were told. The court heard that council records showed there was a planned lottery event with 'a big-name celebrity' dishing out prizes in Cambridge, on the green where the alleged victim said the assault took place. However, police had been unable to confirm who the famous figure was. After reading a series of agreed facts to the jury, Ms Wass confirmed that the prosecution case is now finished. The jury was sent home until Tuesday, when Harris's defence is set to begin, and is expected to start with the entertainer giving evidence. Harris, of Bray, Berkshire, denies 12 counts of indecent assault.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Struggling teen fashion chain Abercrombie & Fitch has announced that the days of its tired nightclub themed stores are over, and will be undergoing a major makeover. Or a make-under as the case may be. In the coming months, the dim lights of its some 400 U.S. stores will be turned up, the thumping music turned down, the half-naked lingering models will acquire clothing and even the pungent perfume spritzes will be reduced by 25 per cent, according to The Business of Fashion. '[Abercrombie] is targeted to its customer, its customer is changing, and we’re ready to change with her and him', says Mike Jeffries, its characteristically stubborn 69-year-old CEO, notorious for once insisting that the brand only caters to 'cool' and 'attractive' kids. Growing up? Abercrombie & Fitch will be toning down its U.S. stores, lifting the lights, quietening the thumping music, covering up its bare-chested models and even lessening the over-zealous perfume spritzes . As part of the overhaul, the heavy, daylight obscuring shutters on the windows have already been removed in 240 stores around the U.S. Even the logos are being toned down and made less prominent. The store, which still doesn't offer women's clothing in sizes that exceed 'Large', a notably small size ten, will also introduce the larger sizes it promised in November, later on this year. And in another 360 degree spin for Mr Jeffries, black will be introduced to some of the new designs, after years of his refusal to permit it previously. Hardly flying off the shelves: In response to poor sales, the brand's logos will also be made less prominent and clothes in larger sizes will be on sale later this year . A leaf out of their book? Teen favorite Forever 21 (pictured) is popular for its cheap, fast revolving stock which satisfies the fickle tastes of youngsters around the U.S. The ailing teen fashion brand has long been struggling to compete with cheaper, fast-turnaround chains such as H&M and Forever 21, as well as with the storming success of online portals with cult social media followings such as Nasty Gal. With that in mind, Abercrombie is also attempting to infiltrate the heaving beast of the teen blogosphere by striking deals with key influencers in the manner of its competitors. Which might be somewhat of a challenge, given the brand's persistent hangover from comments Mr Jeffries made back in 2006, sparking a boycott from stars including Miley Cyrus and Ellen Degeneres. Current season: Abercrombie's preppy, flesh exposing clothing once crawled the hallways of American high schools and remained popular and highly-desirable for decades . Hunks: Some shoppers swoon over the Greek god physiques of the  Abercrombie models scattered around stores, others are intimidated, but either way, the shirts are going back on . 'We hire good-looking people in our stores,' Jeffries said in 2006. 'Because good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don't market to anyone other than that.' He continued: 'In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids. Candidly, we go after the cool kids.' When asked if he considered Abercrombie 'exclusionary', he replied: 'Absolutely. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong.' CEO: Mike Jeffries, 69, caused outrage in 2006 for agreeing that yes, Abercrombie is 'exclusionary', saying that 'a lot of people don't belong, and can't belong' in his stores . Abercrombie was originally established as a sporting goods retailer in 1892, and operated a New York store that was frequented by game-hunting enthusiasts like Theodore Roosevelt. The retailer changed ownership and direction many times and by the mid-1990s had transformed itself into a hub for teenage fashion. Abercrombie’s skin-tight ribbed tank tops, ripped flare jeans, hooded sweatshirts, and leather flip-flop sandals became stalwarts in the hallways of American high schools. 'We want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don't market to anyone other than that' But the brand - confident in its established standing - has ultimately failed to innovate in recent years. Last November, even Abercrombie's own head of planning, Leslee Herro, called the label ‘a stale brand,’ Reuters reported. ‘We recognize that our businesses have been and will continue to be disrupted by both fast fashion and pure play e-commerce competitors,’ she said, further explaining: ‘While the company is playing good defense by cutting expenses, this does little to revitalize what we believe is a stale brand.’","The ailing teen fashion label will also be introducing larger sizes later this year .

"By . Richard Spillett . This is the grinning face of a sex attacker who terrorised women for more than twenty years. John Williams, 47, was responsible for a spate of at least 14 assaults dating back to 1991 on victims aged from 16 to 50. He has now been given a potentially lifelong sentence by a judge who told him he may never be considered safe enough to be release. Williams, a former concrete mixer, targeted women around Ashford in Kent where he lived with his wife and family. Grinning: John Williams has been given a potentially lifelong sentence for a spate of sex attacks on women and girls in Ashford, Kent over 20 years . Prosecutor Peter Forbes said: 'This was a campaign of sexual assaults against a number of girls and women ranging from 16 to 50 years old. 'Predominantly his victims were walking alone on footpaths in parks or wooded areas when they were attacked from behind and taken to the ground.' Williams admitted 13 sex assaults dating from 1991 to August 2013 and asked for a further 16 offences, including another sexual assault, to be taken into consideration. Canterbury Crown Court heard how he told one 18 year-old victim: 'If you scream, I'll rape you.' Another said the attack changed her from a person 'who would walk without fear, to a prisoner in her own home'. When Williams approached one woman in 1994 he told her he had been offending for months.The prosecutor said the attacks originally related to the theft or attempted thefts of handbags. Mr Forbes said: 'Usually they were done on a lone woman walking in wooded areas during the hours of darkness - and some of the incidents were also sexual.' Some of his victims wept in the public gallery as Judge Adele Williams sent him to jail. He must serve at least seven years behind bars and will only be released if he can convince a parole board is no longer dangerous. The judge said: 'You have carried out a terrifying campaign of sexual attacks. You are a sexual predator and a danger to women. You caused terror in all your victims.' Williams carried out at least one of his attacks on the quiet paths and streets around Singleton Lake in Ashford . Canterbury Crown Court (pictured) heard police missed an opportunity to catch Williams when they failed to take a DNA sample . She added: 'I have no doubt your victims felt terror and have been deeply traumatised. 'Such was the public horror and revulsion of your offences, this calls for a denunciatory sentence. The effect of my sentence is you may never be released.' The court heard that police bungled the hunt for Williams when he was identified as a suspect by one victim - but they failed to take a DNA sample from him in 2012. It was not until a year later that he was caught after he was able to carry out two more attacks on young women. A detective chief inspector and a detective constable were served with gross misconduct notices for the shocking blunder. The court heard that Williams told a psychiatrist he was glad he had been caught and was 'disgusted' with himself.","Former concrete mixer John Williams went after lone women and girls .

"By . Sam Webb . Conman: Michael Hirst, who has been sentenced to three years for theft after scamming vulnerable pensioners out of £130,000 . A financier fleeced vulnerable pensioners in swindles which netted him £130,000. Michael Hirst, 53, of Mayals, Swansea, was described as 'jaw-droppingly callous' as he was jailed for three years at Cardiff Crown Court after admitting 13 counts of theft. He stole life savings, nest eggs and even a widow's pension pay-out in a five-year con from August 2007. Hirst even spoke at the funeral of the husband of one of his victim's, while pocketing cash the widow gave him for her own future funeral. The conman, now divorced, moved to Wales in January 2006 and began working for HHPG financial services which has offices across South Wales, the court heard. He left the business in December 2010 after he was convicted of assaulting his wife. His double life then began to unravel as the company found investors coming forward it had no knowledge of. Pensioner Teresa Davies, 73, gave Hirst more than £69,000 for investment, including £40,000 from the sale of her daughter's home after her death, money earmarked for the education of the daughter she left behind. John Evans, 74, of Ystrad, Rhondda Valley, handed over £40,000 life savings for investment and was given documents Hirst made on his laptop. Retired Swansea nurse Priscilla Thomas, 66, saw Hirst as a trusted friend and gave over her pension lump sum of £17,000 for investment. She gave him £4,900 for her own future funeral, which he pocketed. She also trusted him enough to give him 11 signed blank cheques so he could take advantage of investment opportunities for her. 'I feel that he has taken my trust, screwed it up into a ball and thrown it back in my face,' Mrs Thomas told the court. He stole life savings, nest eggs and even a widow's pension pay-out in a five-year con from August 2007, Cardiff Crown Court heard . Lee Reynolds, defending, said Hirst was 'genuinely remorseful,' adding he also suffered from very serious health problems. Judge Thomas Crowther, passing sentence, said: 'This was a pitiless course of offending without a shred of empathy at all. 'The fact that you spoke at Priscilla Thomas' husband's funeral would be seen by most as jaw-droppingly callous. 'You did all this simply to make yourself feel good. Whether you remorse is genuine is questionable given the length of time of your offending.'","Michael Hirst operated a five-year scam targeting unsuspecting pensioners .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . 'Groper': Harris touched the breast and behind of a 15-year-old girl at an Australian shop in 1991, Southwark Crown Court heard . Rolf Harris groped a 15-year-old girl's breast after telling her to give him a hug, before rubbing his groin against her mother's behind, a court heard. Harris, 84, approached the girl - who cannot be named for legal reasons - at an event in an Australian shop in 1991, Southwark Crown Court heard. The teenager later told her mother what happened - and described Harris as a 'dirty old man' - but did not take the complaint further for fear of making a fuss. Speaking to the court via video-link, the woman said: 'He put his right hand on my left breast and through my shirt. I had a shirt that was gathered and did not have buttons on the front. 'He put his other hand on my right butt cheek. His hand was over my bra but through my shirt. 'It was very deliberate. I stepped back and he laughed'. She recalled pulling away from him and then making her way back in to the crowd. Now a mother-of-five, the woman told the court: 'I was in shock and I stayed away from him'. The court also heard evidence from her mother, who said Harris rubbed his groin against her while a photograph was being taken. She said she called him a 'disgusting creature', which made him 'sneer' at her. Harris stands accused of 12 counts of indecent assault between 1968 and 1986, and denies all charges. The alleged assaults in Australia are not part of the charges for which he is being tried. The women were speaking to give evidence of Harris's bad character. The woman's mother said that when she asked her daughter what was wrong she did not explain fully and would only say that Harris was 'very handy'. There were around 20 people in the store at the time of the alleged attack. Harris was drawing cartoons and greeting people when the two women arrived. Scroll down for video . 'Dirty old man': Jurors heard Harris - pictured with with daughter, Bindi, and wife, Alwen - also rubbed himself against the girl's mother . The teenager was asked if she wanted to do a drawing with Harris but she refused and did not want to go near him, she said. She rejected a suggestion by Sonia Woodley QC, defending, that she had decided to 'jump on the bandwagon' by making the assault claims. When Ms Woodley suggested Harris had not indecently touched her, she replied: 'He did. I was a very naive young lady. It was extremely unacceptable'. Her mother also claimed that Harris sexually assaulted her on the same day, saying she felt him rubbing his groin against her buttocks as he stood behind her while posing for a photograph. The . mother, also via videolink, said: 'He was very close to me. He was close . enough to be rubbing himself up against my buttocks. I do not consider . that it happened to me, it was something that was done to me'. She responded by deliberately treading on his foot, she claimed, and turned around and said: 'You are a disgusting creature'. The mother told the court that Harris’s expression switched from being 'smiling and friendly' to an 'almost sneer'. Charges: Harris, 84, seen arriving at court with (L-R) his daughter, wife and niece, denies all 12 counts of indecent assault . She said: 'I had challenged him in some way. He was almost acting in disbelief. He was close to me, right into my face, and he said, ""she likes it.""' The mother said she knew he was talking about her daughter. She claimed Harris seemed to 'home in' on her daughter when he arrived at the store. He asked her if she wanted to help him with some drawings. The mother told the court: 'He was in close proximity to her and suddenly she pulled away from him. She seemed to be taken aback by something. Initially she moved away from him. 'I asked her what was wrong. She said, ""mum, he is very handy."" It all happened so quickly'. Ms Woodley . suggested that Harris did not touch her while the photograph was being . taken and that he did not say that her daughter 'liked it'. In . response the mother told the court: 'Rolf Harris is a dirty old man who . certainly did say that. I have had to bear the burden of putting my . daughter in that position. It is certainly something I did not make up'. Asked . about why she did not act on her daughter’s allegations earlier, the . mother said: 'I thought about telling the police however my innocent 15 . year-old daughter insisted not to do it. She did not want much fuss'. Earlier, the mother of an aspiring teenage theatre star who claimed she developed an eating disorder after allegedly being groped by Harris as a 15-year-old said her daughter has 'never been the same'. Tonya Lee, now 43, who has waived the right to anonymity given to alleged sex offence victims, said Harris touched her when she travelled to Britain from Australia for a tour in 1986. Her mother, Jean Mulgrew, told the jury that she was not the same when she returned home and she became anorexic and also suffered from bulimia. Speaking by video-link, she told the court: 'I do not remember much but I remember one thing and that is Tonya’s life changed and it was for the worse. 'It was when she came back from overseas and she has never been the same since'. After being cross-examined by defence lawyers, Ms Lee admitted she had weight issues before the date of the alleged assault, which she had given a wrong date for. But she insisted that Harris was still to blame for eating disorders after the time she met Harris. As evidence was given, Harris  listened intently evidence and occasionally took sips of water. Smartly dressed in a blue suit, white . shirt and patterned tie, he arrived at court accompanied by his wife, sculptor and jeweller Alwen Hughes and other family members. The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Harris groped a 15-year-old in Australian shop in 1991, a court heard .

"By . Tara Brady . Two more men have been found guilty of wearing burkas and posing as Muslim women to steal £1m of designer watches in a smash and grab attack raid at Selfridges. Ritchie Graham, 23, and Vincent Bellamy, 37, were found guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery at the Selfridges Wonder Room between 1 January 2013 and 7 June 2013. Customers and staff at the famous store on London’s Oxford Street were left 'terrified' as a gang of men dressed in burkas smashed display cabinets in the shop's Wonder Room stealing 143 watches worth £1,496,280 and damaging others worth £1.1m last June. Smash and grab: An eyewitness films one of the burka-clad robbers fleeing Selfridges . But as they fled on stolen motorbikes, a motor scooter and a BMW car, the rider of the scooter Connor Groake lost control and both he and Sam Curtin, who was still wearing his burka, were tackled to the ground by passers-by. The gang, armed with axes and other equipment, had also worn burkas to raid a jewellery store in Windsor two months earlier. During the 'well-planned robbery' at Robert Gatward jewellers in King Edward Court the gang smashed display cabinets stealing 19 Rolex watches costing between £3,000 and £31,650 each. As they ran through the pedestrian zone, one of the burqa clad men wielded an axe raised above his head to 'ward off anyone who may have sought to impede their escape.' Caught on camera: This cameraphone video shows one of the robbers running for the exit . The north London-based gang escaped by car with £175,000 of watches and caused a further £41,361 worth of damage. Prosecutor Roger Smart earlier told Kingston Crown Court following the Windsor robbery, the same gang, along with some new faces, 'doubtless buoyed by the success of the robbery in Windsor' targeted Selfridges on Oxford Street in central London on June 6th last year. He said: 'The plot to rob was audacious, well-planned and carried out with the same degree of professional execution as the previous robbery. 'They made their way inside the store and smashed at showcases containing high value watches of a variety of makes. Escape: The burka-clad raider clutches what appears to be an axe while fleeing the scene . 'Members of the public and staff were terrified by their actions. The robber used the burka to disguise their identities and hide their equipment. 'Such was their behaviour and appearance that it crossed the minds of many of those who were forced to witness the robbery that the men dressed in burka were using them in order to hide their identities while perpetrating a terrorist atrocity.' But as they escaped the scooter rider lost control and Mr Smart said: 'It was the quick thinking and bravery of members of the public that lead to both of them being detained, some of the watches being recovered and aided the police investigation.' Response: The court heard how getaway drivers crashed and were apprehended . Before the trial started Curtin, 20, and Groake, 25, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob Selfridges.Last July, Groake was sentenced to eight years and Curtin to 13 years in jail. Curtin also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob the Windsor jewellery and has yet to be sentenced. Kris Monaghan, 25, and Ian Rawlings, 31, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob Selfridges at an earlier hearing and also await sentence.

"By . Wills Robinson . Kenneth Bright , 91, who risked his life on the beaches at Normandy, has been told he can get into the 70th anniversary event for free after initially being asked to fork out £27.50 . A war museum who denied a D-Day veteran free entry to an event marking the 70th anniversary of the invasion have finally agreed to waive his fee. But Kenneth Bright, 91, said the offer has come too late and maintains he is still not going to the event. As part of the Royal Navy’s Landing Craft Infantry, Mr Bright helped ferry troops to the Normandy beaches on June 6 1944, when more than 5,000 Allied troops were killed. He was initially told he would have to pay the full £27.50 to attend a special airshow at the Imperial War Museum, Duxford. Members of the public then came forward and offered to pay for the war hero's entrance fee. Now staff at the venue reversed their decision after hearing 'feedback.' Hearing the museum had changed their mind, Mr Bright said: ''That is very nice of them, but that wasn't the purpose of the exercise. 'They should have invited the veterans to the event and offered tickets at a concession price to us. 'That would have been a much better approach. 'They haven't given me enough notice and my daughter can't drive me there that day so I won't be going.' Mr. Bright, a great-grandfather-of-13 from Cambridge, said he was annoyed he can only get a seniors concession when under-15s are allowed in for free. Before the offer, he said: 'We were there on D-Day but we can’t even get a discount. 'There aren’t many of us left so surely it’s not asking too much to let us in? 'I’m upset that they did not invite us in for free, or at least offer concessions. He was a member of the Royal Navy's Landing Craft Infantry and ferried troops during the D-Day landings. He is pictured with his crew members before they embarked on the mission . More than 5,000 Allied soldiers died during the Normandy Landings on June 6 1944 . Mr Bright (pictured second left with fellow troops in 1945) said: 'There aren't many of us left so surely it's not asking too much to let us in?' 'After all the whole thing is about the veterans and it’s us being shown off to the world.' Widow . Gillian Turner, from Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire, whose D-Day veteran . husband Ken died last year, said: 'I think the veterans should get some . sort of concession. 'They did a lot for this country and I think they deserve it.' The event will feature an air show of wartime planes. A spokeswoman for the Imperial War Museum, Duxford, said: 'We . have listened to feedback and now realise that on this special occasion . it is more appropriate to make an exception for our D-Day veterans, and . we would be delighted to welcome them at IWM Duxford this weekend . without charge.' A spokesman for the Imperial War Museum, Duxford, said there were concessions for seniors for day to day admissions, but not during air shows .","Kenneth Bright, 91, was told he would have to pay £27.50 for event .

This remarkable footage shows the moment a ‘senseless’ reveller who was fuelled by drink and drugs jumped into the path of an oncoming train forcing it to slam on its emergency brakes. CCTV footage shows how the train came within just inches of hitting Nathan Barker after he jumped onto the railway line at Bentley Station in South Yorkshire. The 21-year-old, who was under the influence of drink and drugs at the time of the incident on March 18, delayed 12 train services for over 90 minutes by standing on the tracks.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A new study has revealed the surprising truths behind the primary concerns of newly pregnant women in 20 different countries around the world, based on their most common Google searches. The first things women in the U.S. want to know when they fall pregnant are ‘how to prevent stretch marks' and ‘how to lose weight', according to the data. The study, compiled by Google data scientist Seth Stephens-Davidowitz for The New York Times, found that while English and Australian women have the exact some body priorities as Americans, the most common search for expectant mothers in South Africa, India and Nigeria is 'how to have sex.' First concerns: New Google data has revealed that the most common search made by newly pregnant women in the U.S. is 'how to lose weight and prevent stretch marks', but for South Africans, Indians and Nigerians, it's 'how to have sex' The top five concerns, in order of popularity for women in the U.S. according to the data are: 'Prevent stretch marks, lose weight, have sex, avoid stretch marks and stay fit.' This order was very similar in Britain and Australia. Absent from these top five concerns, but cropping up in other countries are 'take care' in India, 'stay healthy' in Nigeria, and 'stop vomiting' in South Africa. Google's data unearthed a treasure trove of further facts about how various cultures around the world shape women's priorities so differently, while in some cases, culture seems irrelevant. All women tend to crave the same things for example, regardless of where they live. In the U.S. the top search is 'craving ice', followed by salt, sweets, fruit and then spicy food. This is almost exactly the same in all the countries addressed. Career boost: The American fixation on snapping back into shape after giving birth is reflected in stars like Kim Kardashian (left) and Jessica Simpson (right) who both publicly promoted their post-baby diets . As for the Google search: 'Can pregnant women...?' It's food and drink related questions which top almost every list. But the food types vary. American and British women query the safety of shrimp and prawns, Australians wonder whether they can eat 'cream cheese', Indians search 'pizza', Singaporeans search 'green tea', Mexicans search 'coffee' and oddly, Nigerians search 'cold water.' Other queries that crop up across the board, are from women wondering if they can fly, take pain relief, and drink alcohol. Brazilian women stick out tremendously, seemingly unconcerned by what they should be consuming, and search only for whether they can dye their hair, ride a bike and fly. And the fifth most common search in Mexico is whether pregnant women can wear heels. Surprisingly, in every country examined, the most common dream people Google is overwhelmingly: 'I dreamed I was pregnant', after 'having babies, cheating on a partner, killing someone, dying, and winning the lottery'. Which appears to neatly summarize the whole of humankind and what we're thinking about while we spend nearly half our lives asleep. And surely the most depressing conclusion the study arrived at - for American women at least - are the top searches made by men soon after they find out their wives are pregnant. In Mexico, it's 'words of love' and 'poems for my pregnant wife'. In the U.S., it's: 'My wife is pregnant what do I do' and 'my wife is pregnant now what'. U.S. Prevent stretch marks . Lose weight .

"By . Richard Spillett . MoD civil servant Bernard Gray is getting a new £90,000 a year communications chief at a time the military is cutting troop numbers . A leading figure in the Ministry of Defence is to get his own £90,000-a-year spin doctor at a time when the forces are facing widespread cuts. The MoD is recruiting a new assistant for Bernard Gray, the £200,000-a-year civil servant who was appointed to help bring down the military budget. It comes as the army undertakes a seven-year plan to cut 20,000 military personnel from its numbers in a bid to save money. The new communications chief will be in charge of lobbying parliament and PR for the new Defence Equipment and Support arm of the Ministry of Defence. The new boss's salary is equivalent to the starting wage of five regular soldiers, who start on £17,945 according to the army's website. The government is cutting troop numbers in the regular army from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020, with some of the shortfall being made up by a newly renamed Army Reserve, formerly the Territorial Army. The news has been branded an 'absolute disgrace' by the Pension Justice for Troops group, which is fighting the current cuts and pensions changes on behalf of forces families and ex-servicemen and women. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'Surely if MoD policies are well planned, above board and executed fairly they should stand up to public scrutiny without the need for spin? 'This smacks of the MoD trying to cover its own back while stabbing long-serving serving personnel in theirs, by shortchanging them of the pensions they have earned and deserved.' The Sun . this morning reported that insiders are furious at the amount being allocated for the role and government ministers . have ordered an investigation. The newspaper said the MoD is also paying recruiters £20,000 to track down the right candidate for the job. The government is cutting the number of military personnel by 20,000 . over ten years, raising fears the army could become a 'hollow force' Dia Chakravarty, Political Director at . the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'At a time when necessary savings are . having to be made, splashing out on not just a super-expensive . communications role but also paying a hefty finder's fee - all at . taxpayers' expense - is baffling. She added: 'What people want is an effective and efficient military service, not a highly-paid communications team spinning the news.' Dia Chakravarty, Political Director at the TaxPayers' Alliance, has hit out at the move . Mr Gray . has been already been criticised for his spending after it emerged in . December that he claimed more than £100,000 on expenses for his first . year in the job. It was reported he enjoyed 106 stays in London and Bristol hotels, for £23,000, despite . his home being less than a 60-mile drive from both, and was also given . an official car and chauffeur, costing the department £65,531. The former journalist, who was a defence advisor for Tony Blair's administration, earns £220,000 a year as Chief of Defence Material after he was taken on in 2010 to help target waste in the department. Commenting on his new spin doctor, an MoD spokesperson said: 'This position, which has existed since 2007, is responsible for a range of tasks, including internal communications, on which there will be an increased emphasis following the launch of Defence Equipment and Support as a separate trading entity.' They said the role would be 'responsible for a team of 51 staff, only 14 of which are currently dedicated to communications'. In December last year, General Sir Nick Houghton, Chief of the Defence Staff, said there was a huge danger Britain would have too much state-of-the-art equipment but not enough troops to man it. In a damning assessment of government plans, he said: 'Our current course leads to a strategically incoherent force structure - exquisite equipment, but insufficient resources to man that equipment or train. It is what the Americans call the spectre of the ""hollow force"".'","The government is spending £20,000 on recruiting the new PR manager .

"By . Rob Draper . Follow @@draper_rob . Manchester United are close to losing the remaining members of the Class of ’92 from the coaching structure of the club as Louis van Gaal makes plans for next season as manager. While the club insist that Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil Neville will all be offered roles under Van Gaal, who last week confirmed Ryan Giggs as his assistant, it is understood that Scholes, who has already said publicly that he does not expect to be at United, is unlikely to accept. Nicky Butt already has a job with the Under-21s, though it has yet to be confirmed that he will continue in that role next season, having stepped up to help the first team when David Moyes was sacked, while Phil Neville is also unlikely to accept a post without a clear role. VIDEO: Scroll down for Giggs, Scholes, Nevilles and Butt challenge builders to kickabout . Glitz: The foursome at the [remiere of their film 'The Class of 92' Think tank: Giggs is staying, But might be staying but Scholes looks set to leave . None of the three old boys has been contacted by United executive chairman Ed Woodward to clarify their position in the past week, although the club are comfortable that given their close relationship with Giggs, they are kept abreast of developments. Until Van Gaal and Giggs settle on a coaching team the club maintain it is difficult to specify the exact roles the three might take, though United and Van Gaal are keen to retain them. Scholes, who would want a clearly defined job rather than a general coaching role, is likely to turn his attention to Salford City, the Northern Premier League club the players purchased last season along with Giggs and Gary Neville. All three are understood to have been frustrated by the lack of communication from United over their futures. Woodward and Van Gaal now have to deliver on the summer transfer plans, though Van Gaal’s focus will inevitably be largely on his plans for the World Cup as Holland coach. United were close to signing Bayern Munich midfielder Toni Kroos for this summer, with former manager Moyes and Woodward having put in considerable work to ensure he would come to the club. However, Van Gaal is not minded to pursue the Germany midfielder. With Southampton left-back Luke Shaw already lined up for £27million, United will make a move for Mats Hummels, the Borussia Dortmund and Germany centre-half, who will cost £30m, though the transfer is unlikely to be concluded until after the World Cup. Hummels is the one signing on which Van Gaal will insist, though he also recognises the need to strengthen in midfield. Roma’s Kevin Strootman, who was key in Van Gaal’s Holland teams, will be added, although probably not until January, as his cruciate knee ligament injury means he will not be able to prove his fitness before then. Van Gaal is expected to turn his attention to Daley Blind, the Ajax captain and a part of his World Cup team. Blind, 24, the son of ex-Ajax star Danny, can play at left-back or holding midfield. Making his mark: It is looking less and less likely that Louis van Gaal will keep them all at the club . Target: Bayern Munich's Toni Kroos (right) was wanted by David Moyes before he was sacked . Sign them up: Van Gaal wants Luke Shaw and Mats Hummels to strength United's defensive line . Van Gaal and Woodward will have to move quickly to avoid the mistakes of last summer, when transfer dealing was put on hold until Moyes started the job officially in July. Van Gaal is unlikely to be available to work full-time until early July, when Holland’s participation in the World Cup is over. With significant key players no longer in the squad - Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs - there is an urgent need to bolster the experience and strength of the squad, which is why the club will pay what is required to bring in Hummels. Woodward will be under pressure to deliver for Van Gaal after last year’s dreadful summer, when United missed out on key targets like Cesc Fabregas, Thiago Alcantara, Leighton Baines and Ander Herrera, before launching a last-minute rush to sign Marouane Fellaini for £27.5m, with the former Everton player proving a huge disappointment. Woodward’s performance last summer was criticised severely and it remains to be seen if United have the executive structure capable of landing their first-choice targets. Deep end: United's chairman Ed Woodward was heavily criticised for his poor transfer dealings last summer . Missed: Key transfers targets such as Cesc Fabregas and Thiago Alcantara weren't acquired last summer . Abject: Moyes' only major signing of last summer, Marouane Fellaini, failed to have an impact of Old Trafford . With Sir Alex Ferguson and David Gill no longer having day-to-day involvement and Mike Bolingbroke, the chief operating officer, moving to Inter Milan, Woodward and managing director Richard Arnold now have  a huge range of responsibilities. Van Gaal’s contacts in European football will help Woodward, which is why there is confidence Hummels will be secured, and why Blind and Strootman should be obtainable. Fabregas, who United thought they could sign last summer, is now available with Barcelona ready to let him go, but Van Gaal has not indicated that he wants the player. Other potential midfield targets include Javi Martinez, who wants to leave Bayern, but Ilkay Gundogan, the midfielder most of Europe’s top sides, including United, have been keen to sign despite a long-term injury last season, recently penned a new deal at Borussia Dortmund.","Ryan Giggs set to be assistant under Louis van Gaal next season .

Hodgson, in Portugal with the national team preparing for the World Cup in Brazil next month, made the claim in World Soccer magazine.

Dog and Duck XI: You could organise a team to get behind the ball to stop United racking up the goals . Could you score? Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney are two of the most feared strikers in the world . ‘You can organise a pub team not to let in six goals against Manchester United,’ he said. ‘Give me six months and I’d organise them, if they had a half-decent goalkeeper and a couple of centre halves who can get in the way of the ball.’ Hodgson’s remarks will give Sunday league coaches everywhere hope that they too could manage at the highest level. ‘I consider myself to be in the same position as a lawyer,’ Hodgson added. ‘I studied to be a professional. I like to think that I’m good at my profession.

'I think the frustrations of not delivering of not delivering as a team and on a personal front on a few of these occassions, it gives you that determination with your head held high to make the supporters happy, and give it one more final go.' Gerrard, who turns 34 on May 30, says Roy Hodgson will be looking to play the team in his mind for the first World Cup game against Italy on June 14 in the upcoming friendlies Peru, Ecuador and Honduras. 'With three games to go before the big game he's going to be looking toward the team he's starting in his first game. I'm sure he'll try one or two tweaks though.' Big call: Manager Roy Hodgson has put faith in two of his most experienced performers to lead this summer . Gerrard, when asked if he'd like to avoid Argentina in the World Cup with Angel Di Maria putting in such a fine performance, said the Real Madrid man is relentless. 'Of course you know Real Madrid are littered with top quality players, we talk of Bale, Benzema and Ronaldo, but Di Maria was relentless all game, kept attacking the full-back, for me he was man of the match,' he said. 'They got the substitutions bang on, bringing Marcelo on who was sensational.'

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . Nearly 900 footballers in England are out of contract next month with many of them still unsure of their futures. The majority are already aware they will not receive a new deal and the players’ union, the Professional Footballers’ Association, will be braced for another summer of upheaval when the final figures are confirmed at the end of the month. It is a stunning reminder of the uncertain world of professional football, where in recent summers around 500 footballers have been searching for new clubs. VIDEO Scroll down to watch out-of-contract Chelsea pair Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard . Time running out: Ashley Cole (centre) looks set to leave Chelsea in the summer . These numbers include a wide range of players such as international stars like Frank Lampard, who is expected to extend his career at Chelsea, and Ashley Cole, who is not. There is Joleon Lescott  leaving Manchester City and Joe Cole departing from West Ham. There are young professionals who have been unable to break through into the Barclays Premier League and are looking at their options. Players like Josh Pritchard, who is leaving Fulham and looking to go abroad after loan spells at Tromso in Norway and FC Honka in Finland. There are established Championship stars like Matt Derbyshire. Wait: Frank Lampard's Chelsea contract is running out but he is expected to sign a new deal . The 28-year-old striker scored five goals in five games for Nottingham Forest at the end of the season but is not wanted by new manager Stuart Pearce. There are those like Craig Bellamy who will call it a day at the end of full and rewarding careers — and many more forced to accept  at a young age that they will not have a career in the game. This will be the area where the PFA’s expertise and specific exit  and retraining programmes are vital to many individuals. Much flux  surrounds promotion and relegation issues — those clubs in the play-off finals do not yet know which division they will be in — and down the  pyramid the trend is towards short contracts which guard against a  sudden worsening of fortunes. This appeals to experienced players seeking new challenges, like Matthew Upson. He has turned down a year at Brighton for a one-year deal at Leicester, and another season at the top at the age of 35. David Nugent and Kasper Schmeichel are poised to sign new deals at promoted Leicester, while 31-year-old Lloyd Dyer seems set to opt for the security of a longer deal at Watford rather than another 12 months at Leicester. The influx of foreign players has limited the opportunities for British players but some, like Wales Under 21 international Pritchard, are willing to broaden their horizons and look overseas for opportunities, and not only on the well-trodden routes into North American football. Going: West Ham have confirmed that Joe Cole (left) and George McCartney will leave the club . Out of favour: Joleon Lescott joins the long list of players who will be released by their clubs . Off: Matt Derbyshire isn't wanted by Stuart Pearce despite an impressive run in the Nottingham Forest side . ‘I’ve not really been looking in  England because I don’t want to stay here,’ said Pritchard, on loan at FC Honka until the end of this month. The Finnish club are managed by former Sheffield Wednesday, Ipswich, Blackburn and Crystal Palace striker Shefki Kuqi, but the versatile 21-year-old Pritchard expects his future to be elsewhere. ‘I’ve been looking around Europe a lot,’ he said. ‘I prefer it abroad and the football is more suited to my style of play. There has been interest from Spain, Portugal, Italy and Holland. You can’t limit yourself. People get blinkers on and just want to play in England. On the move: Matthew Upson has signed for Leicester City after leaving Brighton and Hove Albion . 'I want to play in the Premier League, of course I do. It is the best in the world and it’s where everyone wants to play - but there are other options. ‘There are lots of places to go and play football at a high level where you can experience other cultures and lifestyles. Personally, I couldn’t have asked for more from my loan experiences in Finland and Norway.’ Others have taken a similar route. Liverpool-born Michael Higdon played in Holland last year after  joining NEC Nijmegen from Motherwell and Tom Hateley, son of former England international Mark, signed for Slask Wroclaw in Poland.

"By . Declan Taylor . Kevin Lisbie has had his wife to thank for fuelling Leyton Orient all season but the evergreen striker has decided to ban her cooking with Wembley in sight. The east London club compete for a place in the Championship when they take on Rotherham at Wembley in the League One play-off final. And a large portion of their success this term can be traced back to the Lisbie family, and that is not just Kevin’s 18 goals. Chef: Kevin Lisbie's wife Joanne has been cooking for the Leyton Orient squad on away trips . In form: The evergreen striker has scored 18 goals for the O's this season . The Jamaica striker’s wife, Joanne, has been providing the food for Orient’s away trips all season — and they finished with the third best record on their travels, losing only three. But Lisbie revealed that his wife’s cooking has been put on hold for the final trip of the season, the 23 miles from Matchroom Stadium to Wembley, to ensure no one picks up any last-minute stomach bugs. He said: ‘She has done it all through the season. The lads enjoy it. It helps after training on the way to an away game. We have only lost three away games. I am going to put that down to my missus’s cooking. Record: Orient lost just three away games all season and are now facing Rotherham at Wembley . Top job: Russell Slade has done an excellent job at Brisbane Road on a tiny budget . ‘She cooks macaroni and cheese, rice, chicken — nothing too spicy. We travel halfway, then we train. Then we will jump back on the coach and eat it. It is Caribbean food and the lads love it. ‘But she won’t be cooking for the final — I don’t want her anywhere near it just in case anything happens and someone gets ill. We will eat at the hotel and we will do things properly.’ Lisbie describes this as the biggest game of a career which began nearly two decades ago. It was this weekend 16 years ago that he was an unused substitute for Charlton in arguably the most memorable play-off match in history — when his south London club beat Sunderland on penalties to reach the Premier League after a  4-4 draw at the old Wembley. Youngster: Lisbie was an unused substitute when Charlton were promoted to the Premier league in '99 . And now he is determined to finally take his chance on the pitch. He added: ‘I was 19 at the time and to be part of that squad was a massive accomplishment for me. ‘I remember everything. From the beginning to the end and from the night until the morning. To be part of that is something you dream about. ‘You sit down and you dream it will be you one day. Scoring the winner or just being in the winning team. Please God that will be me on Sunday.’","Kevin Lisbie's wife Joanne has been cooking for the team on away trips .

Commiserations: Harry Redknapp gestures to McClaren as the full time whistle blows at Wembley . ‘You want to go down the tunnel when you get a kick like that, but we played the right way and, win or lose, we also wanted to react in the right way. ‘I shook hands with Harry afterwards but I can’t remember what was said  — I was in shock.

The Australian is in danger of losing his place at the top of the Official World Golf Ranking after only a week, depending on how Henrik Stenson finishes at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth, but four birdies helped him to five-under overall to give him a fighting chance going into the final round in Texas. His performance on Saturday showed a steady return to form after a disastrous four bogeys on the opening day put him way off the pace. Not concerned: Scott said that he wasn't focused on events elsewhere, only on his golf and his performances . When asked if the possibility of Stenson usurping him was a concern, Scott told the PGA Tour website: 'I can only worry about my golf here. Worrying about that isn't going to help me at all. 'It's all very tight. We know that. I'm happy to have gotten to number one. I hope it's not such a short stay.'

"By . Margot Peppers . A parenting magazine editor has spoken out about the surprising backlash that ensued after she put a breastfeeding woman on the cover. Ariel Gore, who has edited Hip Mama for 20 years, selected a powerful cover photo for the summer issue showing a topless mother in a Spider-Man mask nursing her toddler son. 'I thought the image invoked the . unrealistic notion of the ""Supermom"" who can do everything and countered . it with the vulnerability of being partially naked with a small child,' she wrote on the Huffington Post. Too much? Ariel Gore, the editor of parenting magazine Hip Mama, has spoken out about the surprising backlash that ensued after she put a breastfeeding woman on the cover (pictured) But when she posted the cover on her Facebook in the lead-up to the issue's release, some people took issue with the picture, claiming it was too indecent to line the shelves of magazine vendors. Facebook censors even attempted to remove the photo from Ms Gore's timeline, despite the fact that she had previously posted a Cosmopolitan cover with a much more visible nipple, and there was no backlash at all. 'I was left to assume that it's the breastfeeding that some people find offensive,' she wrote. The photo is a self-portrait by artist Ana Alvarez-Errecalde, who said its aim was to show the unique relationship between mother and child, 'where each being is complete by themselves but they are reinvented and strengthened by the relationships they establish with each other.' Compromise: Ms Gore was forced to produce two versions - an uncensored one for her subscribers and select bookstores, and one for vendors that had a red dot over the woman's nipple (pictured) But vendors refused to see it that way. One distributor explained her reasoning to Ms Gore, telling her: 'This isn't Europe. Open breastfeeding is not okay.' Others asserted that it wasn't the act of breastfeeding that was offensive, it was the fact that the child pictured is four, which is generally considered by Americans as too old to be nursing. But Ms Gore . feels that this belief is a product of our society's 'squeamish' attitude towards breastfeeding in general, since the average worldwide . weaning age is between two-and-a-half and four-and- a-half. Unfair attitude: 'Nursing mothers face this every day when we try to feed our children in restaurants or in other public places,' said Ms Gore (pictured) By contrast, the average age a child is weaned off of breastfeeding in America is three months. 'American attitudes about breasts and breastfeeding have to be at least partially to blame,' she wrote. In any case, Ms Gore was forced to produce two versions of the magazine - an uncensored one for her subscribers and select bookstores, and one for vendors that had a red dot strategically placed over the woman's nipple. Even though she says she 'didn't want even to entertain the ridiculous suggestion that it was in any way obscene,' ultimately she decided that a censored issue was better than no issue at all. What's more, she hopes the photo and the controversy it ignited will help start a larger conversation. 'Right now this is about an image of an artist breastfeeding on the cover of a magazine,' she wrote. 'But nursing mothers face this every day when we try to feed our children in restaurants or in other public places.' The two versions of Hit Mama's summer issue were released on Mother's Day.","When Hip Mama editor Ariel Gore posted a photo of the cover on her Facebook page, vendors threatened not to sell .

"By . Deni Kirkova . TV baking competitions have got us all giving cake making a go, but some passionate pâtissiers really do go the extra mile. In fact, one couple from south west London have turned their enthusiasm into a business. The Tattooed Bakers have only been going a year but its latest creation, a giant cake of Angelina Jolie's wicked character from new Disney film Maleficent, has caused ripples of excitement through the baking world. Ange would be proud: The private commission mastered by the Tattooed Bakers . Blood and gore: The red velvet cake was intentionally morbid .

Richard, who owns a nightclub in Wimbledon, and Eddie, who used to work in retail management, have only been in the baking business for two years. They both have artistic backgrounds - Rich studied art and Eddie's father is a chef. 'I learned how to bake from him,' she tells us. The name Tattooed Bakers set the couple apart from other bakers. Also, they are both quite tattooed! TV chef Gizzi Erskine posted about her admiration for the cake on Instagram, and many others followed suit . 'We started . baking in a weird way... we launched a company called Cake Doggy Dog in . 2012 (cakedoggydog.com) creating bespoke cakes of your dog.

"Edna walked down the aisle after her daughter, but drew the line at trying to catch the bouquet . Wedding was attended by four generations of the family . Bride Maureen, 69, planned her big day in under a month so as to hold it on the same day as her parents wedding on May 23, 1942 . A grandmother-of-six has become Britain’s oldest bridesmaid after she followed her daughter down the aisle - aged 97-years-old. Proud Edna Houghton was delighted to accept the roll of matron of honour at the wedding of her daughter Maureen Grogan, 69. Maureen tied the knot to fiance Duncan McKerracher-Taylor, 86, at the moving ceremony at the Grade II listed Pump Rooms, in Tenbury Wells, Worcs. Proud Edna Houghton, 97, was delighted to accept the roll of matron of honour at the wedding of her daughter Maureen Grogan, 69, to Duncan McKerracher-Taylor, 86. The couple are pictured with Edna holding a photograph of her wedding day on May 23 1942 . The grandmother-of-six drew the line on trying to catch the bouquet of flowers at the wedding reception afterwards . Plucky Edna fulfiled her duties by walking down the aisle with Maureen to stand by her side as she wed her new son-in-law. But she drew the line on trying to catch the bouquet of flowers at the wedding reception afterwards. Maureen . - who met Duncan seven years ago through a dating agency - said she . planned her big day in under a month so as to hold it on the same day as . her parents wedding on May 23, 1942. Yesterday Maureen, from Tenbury Wells, said her mum was 'the life and soul of the party' and an essential part of her wedding. She said: 'I’ve always been incredibly close with my mum. 'So when Duncan proposed I knew the only person I wanted as my matron of honour was her. 'When I told mum we got engaged her face lit up. She was just so happy to see me happy. 'When I asked her she just laughed and said, ‘Oh Maureen you are a fool. How could I be your bridesmaid?’ The wedding was attended by four generations of Maureen's family including mother Edna, daughter Samantha Stacey, 30, and grandson William, six . 'But she was joking and when I overheard her talking to her friends she was bragging about being in the wedding. 'She was so excited and happy for me.' The intimate ceremony with just 20 guests was attended by four generations of Maureen’s family including mother Edna, daughter Samantha Stacey, 30, and grandson William, six. Maureen’s father George passed away in 1997, but Edna has remained dedicated to his memory and a picture of him was included in his daughter’s wedding. The group continued celebrating at a reception, which was held at the Peacock Inn in Knighton-On-Teme, Worcs. Mother-of-six Maureen, who divorced her previous husband 12 years ago, added: 'Mum loves to dance and she’s the heart and soul of the party. Maureen and Duncan planned their big day in under a month so as to hold it on the same day as her parents wedding on May 23, 1942 . 'She’s such a special woman and anytime you ask her how she is she says, ""I’m on top of the world of course."" 'I know that’s how she feels today.' Edna and George met in Handsworth, Birmingham where they both were working at an ammunition factory. After a whirlwind romance they were married at a small, local church in the spring of 1942. Edna fell pregnant with Maureen and the couple then moved to the picturesque village of Wythall, Worcs. Maureen, who works as a carer, added: 'I had a very happy childhood. 'I was brought up in the country by very attentive parents. 'We were always together and loved playing cricket or rounders. 'Mum was a caretaker at the local village school and dad worked as a guns inspector. 'They loved each other so much and you could always see the bond they shared. 'I . was an only child so I was very close with my parents. Mum is my best . friend. That’s why it was so important to me to have her in my wedding.' Bride Maureen passes her flowers to her mother who fulfiled her duties by walking down the aisle with Maureen to stand by her side as she said her vows . Groom Duncan, a retired pharmacy director at Boots, where he worked for 42 years, said: 'It has been the best day of my life and we are looking forward to having a happy life together as a married couple. 'We are going to Italy for our honeymoon, I hope we prove that you're never too old to get married and fall in love. 'Edna looked beautiful and every elegant, she did brilliantly and I'm so delighted she could here with us to celebrate our special day.' Edna added: 'I love my daughter very much and I have had the best day ever. I just want to do it all again now, it was just so beautiful. 'Nothing makes me happier than seeing my daughter look so happy and in love. It was been truly wonderful - God bless her.'","Edna walked down the aisle after her daughter, but drew the line at trying to catch the bouquet .

"By . Katy Winter . Almost two thirds of men claim to earn 'Brownie Points' when they're planning a night out with their male friends . They’re the probing questions many of us have been pondering for years: How do you persuade your partner to let you go on a weekend trip with your friends? What’s the secret to going out with your friends while still staying in your other half’s good books? According to new research, if you want to get away, you had better get busy with some serious DIY, cooking or childcare. Researchers say men and women often take on extra tasks at home in order to smooth the way for a big night out, with men more likely to do this than women. Almost two thirds of men (61 per cent) say they need to earn brownie points when they’re planning a night out with their male friends. And while they’re always happy to do their bit at home, they’re more likely to pitch in with the chores when there’s a special event looming. Four in 10 men (40 per cent) say notching up points for good work is absolutely essential in order to put a night out in the diary while eight per cent said they wouldn’t be allowed out if they didn’t smooth the way a bit first. Another 32 per cent of those quizzed say it isn’t completely necessary but certainly makes things easier when it comes to planning social events. Only a third said it wasn’t something they’d ever do. While the way men earn those brownie points varies from household to household, some jobs are apparently more influential than others. A third of all men say the best way to impress their other half is by tackling leftover DIY jobs (37 per cent) while almost a third (29 per cent) regularly cook their partner’s favourite meal to try and impress. Laying on the charm is another tried and tested method, with 27 per cent of men organising a romantic evening or spoiling their loved one with flowers or gifts in a bid to get in their good books. Household chores – 26 per cent get their marigolds on and tackle the cleaning – and some old-fashioned schmoozing are also winners, with 22 per cent showering their partner with compliments and 17 per cent spending quality time with their in-laws ahead of a social event. Doing household chores - 26 per cent get their marigolds on and tackle the cleaning- are a popular way to gain favour before a night out . A further 21 per cent resort to sneakier methods, smoothing the way by suggesting their partner has a night out before them, while 20 per cent hint about going out in advance. 14 per cent make a point of telling their other half about all the great things they’ve been doing to get into their good books and 10 per cent remind their girlfriends about the nights out they’ve enjoyed recently. More than a quarter (26 per cent) adopt these tactics a few times a year, with one in eight (12 per cent) admitting to doing it ‘once or twice’ a year and 17 per cent saying they have to work hard to earn their nights out every month. Father of two, Simon Kemp, 43 from . Stockport, is one of those who is more than happy to take on extra tasks . for the sake of his family and his social life. 'While it’s not strictly essential to put in the work and . earn brownie points, it certainly helps me with my case,' he explains. 'With the . pressures of modern family life, having time out with my friends can seem a . little selfish, so completing some selfless tasks allows me to earn my . reward and the whole house benefits.' Women also attempt to gain their partner's favour before heading out on the town, with half saying they start the planning well in advance . But it isn’t just men taking a stealthy . approach. Although women say they don’t feel as pressured as men – none . of those asked felt it was strictly necessary – 44 per cent of female . partners say they prepare the way to make getting a ‘pass out’ easier . too. For them it’s about taking on extra childcare (55 per cent) and volunteering for solo babysitting (41 per cent) with a third (33 per cent) doing it once a month. Another 50 per cent of women will get a request in for an evening away from home well in advance, although 61 per cent admit to lying about having mentioned it ‘months ago’ and 39 per cent encourage their partner to go out first so it’s ‘their turn’. Interestingly, most of us seem to approve of the unofficial bartering system. A staggering 72 per cent of women say their partner knows what they are doing and six per cent actually like it. At the same time almost half (49 per cent) of men say their wives and girlfriends are aware they’re trying to impress to get something in return and, amazingly, 18 per cent are fine with that. Speaking about the findings, Martin Roberts, spokesman for Jacamo which carried out the research, said: 'We’ve all heard friends and family joking about brownie points and securing a pass to go out, but it seems that for many British men and women they are a reality of family life and coupledom. 'It’s nice to hear that men and women are working so hard to share the chores and make sure they both get some quality time with their friends as it’s important to have some ""you"" time in a relationship.'","Men and women take on extra chores to help get time away from home .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A new series of female action figures seeks to break the mold by creating hero archetypes with more believable bodies and a positive, nonviolent message for young girls. IAmElemental Action Figures for Girls has raised nearly triple its funding requirement on Kickstarter – due to its interest in creating a ‘positive and fierce reinterpretation of the traditional female action figure,’ its campaign explains. The idea for the line came about after its creators Julie Kerwin and Dawn Nadeau of New York ‘discovered that the typical female action figure on the market today is not actually designed for girls at all (or even boys). Instead, most are created for the adult male collector, decidedly more Hooters than Heroine.’ New world order: IAmElemental is a new range of action figures intended to send positive messages to young girls . Different body: The line seeks to retool the typical female figure form, which typically boasts a large chest and unrealistically small waist . In plainer terms, female action figures are typically outfitted with enormous breasts and a tiny waist. IAmElemental seeks to change this with figures that boast a more believable chest and body type. Ms Kerwin and Ms Nadeau have formatted their range of seven figurines as a periodic table of elements, called ‘The Elements of Power’. Each character is named for its positive, nonviolent superpower, including: Bravery, energy, honesty, industry, enthusiasm, persistence, and fear. The four-inch-tall figures have nine points of articulation – their neck, shoulders, elbows, knees, and hips all bend. Each one comes wearing armor, as well as a removable accessory and a shield. Its creators: The line is the brainchild of two New York City moms - Julie Kerwin (left) and Dawn Nadeau (right) Scientific approach: The seven figurines are members of their own periodic table of elements - which include behaviors like bravery and honesty . Their individual retail price has not yet been set. There is also no word of when they may hit store shelves. With still 19 days left of crowd funding left to go, IAmElemental has already raised more than $101,500 – nearly triple its $35,000 pledge goal. The brand’s inventors both attended Wellesley College. Ms Kerwin is a mother of two and works as a music producer. Ms Nadeau is also a mother of two and works as a marketing professional.","IAMElemental is a new line of action figures that are meant to have a positive impact on young girls .

"By . Ruth Styles . London's very first bridge might have been the work of the Romans but as these incredible images reveal, subsequent architects certainly weren't short of bright ideas. From the austere London Bridge, which sits on a site occupied by bridges for more than 2,000 years, to the gaudy crimson and cream steelwork of Blackfriars Bridge, many of the capital's bridges are works of art in their own right. Now, for the first time, London's 20 river crossings are to get a starring role in a new exhibition, Bridge, which explores the pivotal role they played over the centuries as well as their impact on the arts. Turn . of the century: Despite the lack of cars, John Rennie's London Bridge . was a hive of people, carts and carriages as this photo taken in 1900 . reveals . All change: London Bridge remains a busy place come rush hour but the bridge itself is relatively new: Rennie's bridge was replaced by the current one in 1972 . Striking: . This George Davidson Reid photograph shows a trio of little girls and . their father on Tower Bridge looking out over Upper Pool . Different view: The view from Tower Bridge has changed markedly since the 1950s and now includes the towering Shard, the UK's (and Europe's) tallest building . Iconic: Henry Grant's photographs of the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Bridge (left) and Tower Bridge with its bascules raised were made in 1965 and 1973 . New look: Although the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Bridge look the same as they did during the Victorian period, all are lit up at night . Spruced up: Modern day Tower Bridge boasts a patriotic colour scheme and amazing views of the Tower of London and the Gherkin behind . Featuring photos by James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Charles Ginner, William Raban and Lucinda Grange among others, the exhibition, at the Museum of London Docklands, also offers a snapshot of the changing face of the capital over the last 200 years. Earliest of all the photos is a rare snap taken by pioneering photographer William Henry Fox Talbot in 1845, which shows the original Isambard Kingdom Brunel Hungerford Bridge - demolished just 15 years after it was built. Fox Talbot invented the precursor to the modern camera and system of fixing photos that dominated the 19th and 20th centuries, until digital photography became pre-eminent in the early years of the 21st. He began developing his ‘calotype’ system in the 1830s but only published his work in 1839. Until 1845, methods of fixing an image were far from foolproof – and it wasn't until that year that he made his major breakthrough. Among Fox Talbot's first wave of successful 'calotypes' was a snap of Brunel’s Hungerford Bridge - originally built to serve the Hungerford Market on the north bank of the . river, which had been set up by Sir Edward Hungerford in 1682 as a competitor to Covent Garden Market. Rare: . This 1845 salt print was taken by pioneering photographer William Henry . Fox Talbot and shows Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Hungerford Bridge . New bridge: Isambard Kingdom Brunel's suspension bridge was knocked down 15 years after it was built and replaced with this heavier cast iron affair . Packed: Commuters flock across the newly rebuilt London Bridge after its grand opening by the Queen in 1973. The current bridge is the fifth version on the site. Still busy! London Bridge remains a commuter short cut thanks to the presence of the nearby London Bridge Station . Under . construction: A rare snap of Tower Bridge as it was being built. Although it looks medieval, the bridge is actually Victorian and opened . in 1894 . All done: Tower Bridge, now complete, has swapped its chocolate brown Victorian paint job for a cheerful blue and cream one . Striking: Although Waterloo Bridge dominates the background of this 1869 photo, it was taken to chart the construction of the Metropolitan Line . Looking good: Named after the Duke of Wellington's famous victory over the French at Waterloo, Waterloo Bridge is now pristine and the Metropolitan Line complete . Beautiful: . This 1955 photograph of Hammersmith Bridge was taken by Sandra Flett, a . photographer who lived most of her life in nearby Chiswick . Similar: Hammersmith Bridge appears to have changed very little and this photo even shows that the prominent houseboats in the first picture remain in place . At 1,462 feet long, the . bridge was, at the time, one of the longest suspension bridges ever built, although . Brunel, who was already working on several other projects when he took on the . Hungerford Bridge work, appeared less than enthused by the project. An entry in his 1835 diary reads: ‘Suspension . bridge across the Thames – I have condescended to be engineer of this, . but I shan’t give myself much trouble about it. If done it will add to . my stock of irons.’ Despite his lacklustre approach to the work, his bridge proved hugely successful but was later deemed inadequate to meet the demands of the newly opened Charing Cross Station by South Eastern Railway, who purchased it in 1859. The replacement, designed by Sir John Hawkshaw, opened in 1864 and was built using wrought iron lattice girders, which provided a more stable route in and out of Charing Cross station for the heavy iron steam trains then in their heyday. Eventful though its history is, Hungerford Bridge isn't the only bridge to have made its mark on the capital. Another that appears in several incarnations in the exhibition is London Bridge which has been demolished and rebuilt no fewer than five times, most recently in 1972. The very first bridge on the site was the work of the Romans who used it outflank the Britons waiting upriver at the main ford in AD70 and paved the way for the addition of England and Wales, Britannia as it was known to the Romans, to the Roman Empire. Later versions included a wooden bridge that was badly damaged during fighting between armies loyal to Anglo-Saxon king Ethelred the Unready and Viking king Canute in 1014, and the first stone version which was completed in 1209. As remembered in the nursery rhyme, part of this London Bridge really did fall down thanks to neglect on the part of the hugely unpopular Queen Eleanor of Castile who was given the bridge by her husband Henry III in 1249. Calm . before the storm: This 1937 shot shows London in the years leading up . to World War II - much of the East End around Tower Bridge was destroyed . in the Blitz . No change on this side! Looking at this modern photo of commuters streaming across London Bridge, little appears to have changed since the 1930s . Striking: . This negative of Tower Bridge was made circa 1903 - 1910 by Christina . Broom - the UK's first female press photographer . Pretty: . This shot of Richmond Bridge in 1930 was taken by Albert Gravely . Linney, editor of Port of London Authority Monthly Magazine, who took . photos wherever he went . Still peaceful: Richmond Bridge has barely changed at all over the last century and remains a pretty, tranquil place to cross the Thames . Peaceful: . This late 19th century image shows the serene Richmond Bridge - a far . cry from the bustling crowds that flock onto the bridges downstream . Busy: In the 1930s, the Thames was crammed with shipping as this 1935 photo (left) reveals. By the 1960s, it was the bridges, as in this Waterloo shot, that were packed . Old London Bridge: A 1929 photo of John Rennie's London Bridge, which now sits in Lake Havasu City in Arizona after being bought by the McCullogh Oil Company . Later, the bridge was famously used to display the heads of traitors executed at the nearby tower, beginning with Scottish rebel William Wallace who was made an example of by Edward I 'Hammer of the Scots' in 1305. The medieval bridge stood for more than 600 years but in 1831, it was decided a new bridge was needed and a John Rennie design was chosen. Seven years later, the new London Bridge was opened by William IV and Queen Adelaide, but only lasted until the 1960s thanks to the increasing numbers of cars wanting to use it. Other bridges to appear include the iconic Tower Bridge, the new Hungerford Bridge and the even more modern Millennium Bridge. Vauxhall Bridge, which gets its name from a 13th century French mercenary employed by King John, who built 'Fulke's Hall' on the site, also stars in the show. Speaking about the new exhibition and the incredible Talbot calotype that appears in it, curator Francis Marshall said: 'I’m incredibly excited that visitors will have the opportunity to get up close to such a significant early photograph – taken at a time when the medium was still evolving. 'By contrasting the old barges in the foreground with the Brunel's new iron bridge, Fox Talbot highlights the technological advances of the 19th century. 'The photographic process he pioneered would dominate image-making for the next 150 years, until the dawn of digital photography. In a way, he is responsible for the way in which we see the world today. Ironically, Brunel’s bridge was demolished within fifteen years to make way for a railway crossing. 'This delicate salt print has never been out on public display before. Because of its age and the fact that Fox Talbot only perfected his process in 1845; we are not taking any unnecessary risks with it.' Bridge opens at the Museum of London Docklands on the 27th June and runs until the 2nd November. See museumoflondon.org for more information. London's 20 bridges are a familiar sight to commuters and tourists who pass them every day but there's more to the capital's bridges than iron and steel. From the bridge with a paint job chosen by Queen Victoria to the river crossing that doubled as a market, London's bridges are as fascinating as its palaces.

"By . Ruth Styles . For Krissy, 21, home is a large, rubbish-filled storm drain in the business district of Jamaican capital, Kingston. Homeless since the age of 12, his life has been one of hardship, moving from place to place, each squat becoming progressively dirtier, flimsier and more dangerous. But Krissy's bad fortune hasn't come about because he refuses to work or lacks education. Instead, Krissy, and others like him, are ostracised purely because he is gay. Tough: Krissy, just 21, has been homeless and ostracised since the age of 12 because of his sexuality . Jamaica is a country where 80 per cent of the population admit to being homophobic and having gay sex is punishable with 10 years of hard labour in prison. Evangelical preachers who promote homophobia attract huge and receptive audiences, while lyrics in popular songs regularly include exhortations to 'kill the batty boys'. As a result, men like Krissy, who says he has always felt like a man trapped in a woman's body, are forced to the margins of society, with many cast out by their families. Living with Krissy in the drain is a group of 25 men, many of whom have to work as prostitutes to survive, and all of whom face a barrage of violent abuse on a daily basis. 'This is a homophobic country,' says Thelma, another transgender man living in the drain. 'You can't . just go and sit in the park, 10 or 20 men, sit and hold hands and . laugh. 'If gay people are going to meet, you need a safe space to meet.' Cast out: Thelma (left), Krissy (centre) and Sachaberry (centre right) with journalist Ade Adepitan . Grim: The men share this filthy storm drain with 22 others and are flooded with sewage and water when it rains . Precarious: Sachaberry climbs down into the drain in her platform heels. She works as a prostitute . For now, that safe space is the drain, although as Channel 4's Ade Adepitan reveals in tonight's episode of Unreported World, that safety is precarious. In one scene, a crowd streaming back past the drain from an athletics meet turns violent, peppering the gully with stones and screaming insults. Asked what is happening, one replies: 'Them [the crowd] are troubling them because they . think them are gay, which is a man who goes with a man. 'Them boys will . come out and they will burn them up. I want them to burn them up.' When the riot police arrive, they turn their attentions not on the crowd but to the men instead. 'Members of the diverse society, or if . you want to call them, a group of homosexuals, throwing stones at people . passing, pedestrians,' one explains when asked what is going on. For Krissy and his friends Sachaberry and Thelma, this is a risk they run every day. 'It is very, very dangerous to do what I . do,' explains Sachaberry, who works as a prostitute. 'I'm running a great, great risk. I know friends who passed on . because of it, who died, got gunshots, were stabbed...' Sachaberry was herself stabbed when she went to meet a client and found an angry gang of more than a dozen men waiting for her. 'One of them was doing the damage,' she remembers. 'One of . them had the knife, one of them doing the damage. They punctured a . lung... Four times. I could have died.' Krissy too has suffered violent attacks and chose to leave home rather than allow his family, who live in a poverty-stricken part of the Jamaican capital, to be stigmatised by association with him. Painful: Sachaberry shows off one of the scars left after she was stabbed four times and almost died . Furious: Local councillor Carrie Douglas confronts the men. She wants them to be cleared out of the drain . 'You have some Jamaicans who will be moved [by my plight] but it would still leave like a stigma and bring down the family,' he says. Although still close to his sister, he hasn't seen his parents for years and cannot even walk the streets of the shanty where he grew up for fear of attack. 'If I could [walk through the streets], . life would be 100 per cent better for me,' he says. 'I wouldn't have to go back . into the gully. This is my yard, this is . where I was born. This is where I had most of my fun growing up in life.' Quite how precarious his life has become is made plain when you hear from local district councillor, Carrie Douglas, who would like nothing more than to turf the group out of the storm drain. 'Jamaica is homophobic, Jamaica isn't foreign,' she froths. 'So you can't . come to Jamaica and dress up like a drag queen like you are foreign. 'And . guess what! You can do it but if you do do it, you are going to be at a . disadvantage. Standing here, living underneath the gully is a . reflection of that.' Dangerous: Krissy, pictured with reporter Ade Adepitan, says he hopes an angel will take him away one day . 'Behind us is a residential community,' she adds. 'I get reports of petty theft, persons entering illegally into their back yards, whether to make out with people, or to use it as their bathroom. 'That is why the commander of the New Kingston police will try to remove them from this gully. I don't know where they will go after this. That is not my responsibility.' Although Sachaberry insists that a dangerous life on the margins of society is a price worth paying to be herself, it's clear that the strain is beginning to tell on Krissy. 'I think when I can't bear it anymore, . the Lord will send some angel for me who will let me feel relief,' he says, as tears slide down his cheeks. 'Right . now I'm going through a very hard time. I see where I come from and I . see my family and I miss them a lot. 'This life I'm living is not for me . but I have to cope with it and bear it.'

"By . Tom Latchem . The women of Walford had better watch out - hunky Dean Wicks is back and he's threatening to break hearts. It's been six years since the jailbird stormed out of Albert Square after a bust-up with his mum Shirley and left for Australia. Now a trained hair stylist, Dean will be opening a trendy salon, which actor Matt Di Angelo cheekily reveals is just another way for  his character to cosy up to the local ladies. 'Dean uses his job to get close to women,' Matt says with a grin. 'He likes plenty of eye candy to check out, so he's quite enjoy- ing being back. He offers them a shoulder to cry on and then gets them into bed... which is what Dean's all about.' Matt's character Dean will be opening a trendy hair salon in the square . No change there then. In his last spell in EastEnders, from 2006-8, he bedded Stacey Slater and made a beeline for glamourpusses Dawn Swann and Chelsea Fox. Matt's own love life has made headlines too. In 2007 his Strictly Come Dancing partner Flavia Cacace chose Matt over her long-term lover Vincent Simone, and then a year later she split with Matt to be with Corrie actor Jimi Mistry, who she's since married. Matt as Dean in EastEnders back in 2007 . Matt's now single and keen to meet someone special. 'But,' he adds, 'Work's pretty crazy, so I find it hard even to see my friends.' While Dean has returned to the Square to see his grandad Stan, Matt was persuaded back by the exciting plans of new executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who's bringing Albert Square up to date to reflect modern-day East London. A new set is also being built that will be 20 per cent bigger, meaning there'll be more scope for filming in new locations. 'I'd just finished filming a historical drama called Borgia when I got a call from Dominic,' explains Matt, 27, who has appeared in hit BBC1 series Hustle and several plays since leaving EastEnders. 'His enthusiasm hit me and made me consider a return. Dom's young himself and wants to bring in that young, modern element, which I like. I think it's a good thing for the show as they start to make it reflect the vibrant East End in 2014.' Matt's last stint on the show ended with the 'shock' of his contract not being renewed. Looking back, he says it was just the nudge he needed. 'EastEnders was an apprenticeship  - I was 18, it was my first job and I learned a lot. I don't think I did all that well my first time there. I was a teenager and just blagging it. Working on other things has made me a better, more rounded and experienced actor,' he insists. 'I've worked alongside some great people, and that really helps you learn. I've been lucky with the way things have gone.' It remains to be seen if Walford's women will feel the same way.

"By . Roz Lewis . Trisha after she joined ABC in Australia . When I was in my late twenties and living in Sydney, Australia, I had a job offer that ended up changing my life in more ways than one. I'd moved to Australia in 1985 after meeting and marrying the politician Robert Nestdale. I began working in PR but then, when my marriage disintegrated, I started work as a reporter with ethnic TV channel SBS. I'd wanted to be a journalist for years while I was an air hostess in the Middle East, so I'd already taken short courses and done some voluntary work at radio stations. My job at SBS, my first in television, really suited me and I very much enjoyed working in such a creative environment. So much so that after a year there I applied to be a reporter on a show called The 7.30 Report on ABC, a much bigger TV station with a huge national audience. I had an interview, and then a few days later I was asked to meet the MD David Hill. 'Great,' I thought, 'I must be close to getting the job.' To my surprise, after a short chat with David he announced I was going to be Australia's first black TV presenter! I was shocked. I'd gone for a reporter's job, and now this! But Australia in the 1980s wasn't as racially tolerant as it is now, so when the news got out it stirred up a huge media storm. Everyone had an opinion as to why a Pommie black female was on Australian TV. Surely if a person of colour was going to be on television it should be someone from the indigenous Aborigine population? I was living with my new fiancé, TV producer Mark Grieve, at the time and I remember having to lie on . Trisha as a guest on This Morning . the back seat of the car as he drove me to the gym so journalists wouldn't spot me! But even though I loved my job and put 110 per cent into it, it didn't stop the sniping. In fact, the negative press only died down when Michael Parkinson wrote an article in a British newspaper accusing the Australians of being intolerant, which was picked up worldwide. I worked on The 7.30 Report for a couple of years before setting up my own production company to make a chat show called Live It Up, which was then noticed by Anglia Television in Britain. They were looking to replace Vanessa Feltz when she left her talk show, and they offered me my own show. Even though I was living in Australia, had two young girls and was about to marry my third husband, I leapt at the chance to get into TV in Britain, so I moved back to the UK and Trisha took off. Now I'm doing my show in America, The Trisha Show, and I think that huge media storm helped toughen me up for the future, while the job at ABC set my career in motion. I'm so glad it's still continuing - 26 years in the business is a huge achievement. I've fulfilled most of my ambitions now, but I'd still like to direct a movie. You never know what's around the corner. The Trisha Show will air here on 5USA next month. Trisha is patron of the Norwich Home-Start family charity; www.homestartnorwich.org.","Trisha found fame when she became Australia's first black TV presenter .

"By . Emma Innes . A mother who lost twice the amount of blood in her body giving birth to her first child says she is terrified at the thought of going through labour again. Samantha Slater, 29, says she has been left with a phobia of childbirth after haemorrhaging during the delivery of her son. She lost 17 pints of blood during the horrific ordeal - double the amount of blood usually in the body. Samantha Slater lost twice the amount of blood in her body after baby Jaeden's birth and says she is still traumatised at the thought of childbirth . She feared she would die before she had the opportunity to hold her son, Jaeden, but doctors were able to save her life using expanding glue. Mrs Slater, from Accrington, Lancashire, went into labour in November last year and was taken to St Mary’s Hospital in Manchester. But after four days of labour she was still only 7cm dilated and was given an emergency C-section under general anaesthetic because the birth was taking too long. Just minutes after coming around she started haemorrhaging and was whisked straight back into theatre. She said: ‘I still get flash backs from the event. It was horrific, I had no idea what was happening I just felt warmth between my legs and then I was rushed straight to theatre. ‘All I wanted to do was hold my little boy - I didn’t even know if he was okay. Jaeden was delivered by C-section and after the operation Mrs Slater started to haemorrhage. She lost 17 pints of blood and had to be given multiple blood transfusions . At one point, Mrs Slater's husband, Jerome, was warned that she might not pull through . ‘I felt as though I was dying. I remember just praying that I would survive so that I could see my son. ‘I don’t remember a thing but apparently I kept asking if I was dying. At first I thought I was weeing, I never imagined I was haemorrhaging. ‘I had only just woken up from the operation so I hadn’t even held Jaeden yet when I was whisked away to the emergency room. ‘I barely remember what happened because I was in such a state of shock. One minute I had just given birth and the next doctors were rushing around me. ‘My husband was looking down and told me there was blood everywhere. After that I blacked out, but he has told me I kept waking up and saying “don’t let me die”.’ Mrs Slater remained in the emergency room for five hours and underwent several blood transfusions while doctors tried to stop the bleeding. Mrs Slater says she now has a phobia of childbirth and is terrified of every having another baby . Mrs Slater (pictured with her husband, Jerome) had to spend time in intensive care after the birth and it was six days before she could hold Jaeden for the first time . In all, the blood from 17 different donors, were given to her. At one point doctors told her husband, Jerome, 27, a business account manager, that it was touch and go whether she would make it. Thankfully, doctors found the tear in her uterus just in time and managed to stop the bleeding using special expanding glue. After the operation, Mrs Slater was taken to intensive care before being transferred to a high dependency unit for four days. It wasn’t until six days after the birth that she was able to hold baby Jaeden, now five months, for the first time. She added: ‘I was taken to the baby unit in a wheelchair because my legs were swollen from the blood transfusions so I couldn’t walk. Mrs Slater (pictured with Jaeden and her husband, Jerome) said: 'I'm so glad I pulled through, and having little Jaeden was worth it - but I'm never having any more children. I still wake up with nightmares and I'm terrified of every getting pregnant again in case the same thing happens' ‘Holding him after everything was amazing. He was two days old and I couldn’t believe how tiny he was. ‘Looking at him for the first time made me forget the hell I had just been through.’ After the terrifying event, Mrs Slater stayed in hospital for two weeks so that she could be monitored before being sent home. The lifesaving treatment left her body swollen for weeks, though she has since made a full recovery. Mrs Slater added that she was so traumatised by the event she is unlikely to ever have children again. She said: ‘I’m so glad I pulled through, and having little Jaeden was worth it - but I’m never having any more children. ‘I still wake up with nightmares and I’m terrified of every getting pregnant again in case the same thing happens. Mrs Slater (pictured with her sister, Kelly, when she was seven months pregnant) says that if it weren't for all of the blood donors who saved her life, Jaeden would now be without a mother . ‘Jaeden is a perfectly healthy little boy now, and I am a healthy woman. We have a great little family unit. ‘I had no idea that it was possible to be given that much blood. I have 17 people who have saved my life. ‘If they hadn’t donated their blood when they did, there might not have been enough available and my child would be without a mother.’ Dr Alexander Heazell, Consultant Obstetrician at St. Mary’s Hospital, said: ‘Seventeen pints is a significant amount of blood to lose during or after giving birth, and is thankfully a highly unusual occurrence. ‘In Samantha’s case, we used a special glue-like substance that temporarily blocked the blood supply to the uterus to stop the bleeding. ‘I am really pleased that Samantha has recovered well.’","Samantha Slater's son, Jaeden, was delivered by emergency C-section .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A teenager who choked on spaghetti as a child is today so terrified of food that she refuses to eat anything apart from chicken escalopes. Charlotte Snow, from north London, has shunned most other foods since she was three years old, despite her parents' desperate attempts to improve their daughter's diet. Her mother Carla Snow, 42, said she believes Charlotte's phobia stems from a near-death experience when she was three. Charlotte Snow, 18, from north London, has a phobia of food, resulting in her eating nothing but chicken escalopes . Her mother Carla Snow (pictured left) believes her daughter's phobia stems from a near-death experience when she was three, when she choked on a piece of spaghetti . Despite her poor diet, repeated visits . to the doctors have revealed she is suffering no health complications as . a result of her phobia. She said: 'I’ve been scared to try other foods since I can remember. 'Just . the thought of putting other foods in my mouth and then not liking the . taste makes me feel anxious. I don’t know what I would do if I ate . something I wasn’t keen on.' Her mother Mrs Snow, who works at a children's centre, said: 'When Charlotte was a . baby, she ate everything and we had no problems at all. 'But one day, I . was feeding her some spaghetti and she choked on the food. 'We . patted Charlotte’s back and managed to get the spaghetti out. But that . experience scarred her and ever since then, she’s turned her back on . most foods and has been very fussy. 'We . kept trying to put other foods in front of Charlotte but she would turn . her nose up at them and rather starve. She could never get over her . fears. Charlotte (pictured left age five and right now) said: 'I've been scared to try other foods since I can remember . Until the spaghetti incident when she was three, Charlotte would eat most foods, her parents Carla and Nick (pictured) said . Despite her parents' desperate attempts to encourage Charlotte to expand her diet, the 18-year-old has resisted, only adding white bread, crisps and cereal to the equation . 'Once, we even . arranged for Charlotte to have an internal examination so we could find . out if there was any deeper reason for her phobia. 'But she refused to . eat the egg sandwich that she needed to consume before the test.' The 18-year-old has been persuaded to add chips, crisps, bread and cereal to her limited list of foods she will eat. But even with these foods, Charlotte is specific about the brands and varieties she will eat, preferring Walkers' Salt and Vinegar, Hovis white bread and Kellogg's Rice Krispies. Charlotte admits her phobia impacts on her everyday life and makes socialising difficult. She said: 'I find my phobias very embarrassing at times. If I go out to dinner with my friends and there’s no food there that I like, I’ll just starve the whole night and won’t eat. Despite her poor diet, Charlotte has suffered no detrimental affect to her health . 'If some boys that I don’t know well are joining us for dinner then I will arrive after the meal. 'I would be mortified just eating chips in front of the guys so it’s better to avoid the situation altogether. 'Often though, I will go for the whole day without food if there’s nothing available that I can eat. 'The other day I went to a party with my family and there was nothing on the menu I could eat. I was so famished that I had to rush out to the nearest McDonalds to get some chips.' Despite doctors' assurance that Charlotte's health is not affected at the moment, her mother Mrs Snow said she is worried her poor diet could catch up with her. 'We regularly go to the doctor so that Charlotte can take a blood test but the results always come back fine. The doctors continually tell us that Charlotte’s healthy and growing,' she said. 'Nonetheless it does worry me that her poor diet will catch up with her and she will suffer health problems in the future because she’s not getting the nutrients she needs.' Charlotte added: 'I would love to be able to eat more foods one day. It would be great to enjoy dinner with my friends and socialize more.' A spokesperson for Triumph Over Phobia, the phobia charity said: 'Charlotte needs to have a course of exposure therapy to help her overcome her fear of food. 'She will only recover if she faces her fear and she can do this by taking little steps each day.'","Charlotte Snow choked on some spaghetti when she was three .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Dying Kelly Murray has one wish before she loses her fight with a rare disease - to smile in a photograph with her sons. The 33-year-old has lost half her teeth because a cancer-like illness has caused the bones in her mouth to disintegrate. She was diagnosed with the rare disease langerhan cell histiocytosis, which affects one in one million adults, 12 years ago. It now threatens to claim her life, before she as a chance to see Bradley, 10, and Louis, nine, grow up. Dying mother Kelly Murray has one wish before she loses her battle with a rare disease - to smile in a photograph with her sons Bradley, 10, and Louis, nine . The condition has caused Ms Murray to lose her teeth as the bones in her mouth to disintegrate. She is pictured with her sons and their father Jason, before her teeth began to fall out . But with the help of kind-hearted friends, Ms Murray is desperate to smile again, so she can enjoy the time she has left with her sons . 'I don't like smiling now,' the mother-of-two from New Whittington in Derbyshire said. 'I used to be so confident, but now I never want to pose for pictures with my sons.' After suffering two collapsed lungs when she was 20, she was diagnosed with the illness. She went on to become the only person with the illness to carry her own children. But at the start of last year her condition began to deteriorate. The 33-year-old has been told by doctors, she now has just 12 months to live. Two of Ms Murray's friends are launching an appeal to raise money so the 33-year-old can have dentures . 'I find it hard to accept that I won't see my sons grow up,' she said. 'I want to see them grow into young men. I don't want to miss their first day of secondary school. 'I have always tried to keep on going, but you know your own body, and I know. I can barely lift things. 'Sometimes the pain is so bad and I don't sleep, and if I do I wake up gasping. I'm more tired and I feel weaker.' Langerhan Cell Hisiocytosis, or LCH, is an extremely rare cancer-like disease that attacks the organs. It causes pain in the bones, spontaneous fractures, loss of teeth and extreme fatigue as well as weakness, seizures and collapsed lungs. It can affect a sufferer's memory and affect the pituitary gland, leaving the disease to spread from one organ to another. Ms Murray has to use an oxygen tank because the disease has cut her lung function by 60 per cent. Now her friends Karla Wilkinson and Sherralyn Newton want to raise money so Ms Murray can have veneer dentures fitted and be able to smile again. 'It would give me my confidence back, and I could pose for pictures the boys could look at for years to come, even after I'm gone,' she said. Ms Wilkinson added: 'We're also hoping to get her and the boys a private photo shoot and maybe a holiday so the boys have memories to last along with Kelly's smile.'","Kelly Murray was diagnosed with langerhan cell histiocytosis 12 years ago .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A self-confessed 'bad boy' is today preparing to donate one of his kidneys to save the life of a complete stranger to make up for all the wrong he has done in his life. Wesley Joyce, 32, will become an organ donor after being touched by 34-year-old Sally-Anne Grainger who has cystic fibrosis. The pub landlord came forward after hearing the mother-of-two's desperately plea for help in April. Ms Grainger went into renal failure after having to take strong medication following a double lung transplant in March 2009. Wesley Joyce (left) said he felt compelled to donate his kidney to mother-of-two Sally-Anne Grainger (right) after hearing of her plight. She went into renal failure after having to take strong medication following a double lung transplant in 2009 . Mr Joyce, pictured, came forward after hearing about the mother's pleas for help in April . Following her first transplant Ms Grainger said she had been . given a second lease of life. But since her kidneys started to fail, the student has been forced to have dialysis treatment three times a week, leaving her 'barely existing'. She is also anaemic and gets easily exhausted, which is impacting negatively on her university work. She pleaded for a donor to come forward, wanting to extend her life to spend as much time as possible with her daughters Kelsey, 14, and Megan, 10. In 2009 the mother-of-two had a double lung transplant and is now preparing to go under the knife for the life-saving operation after doctors gave the transplant the go-ahead. Mr Joyce, a former soldier, said giving Ms Grainger the 'gift of life' to change his ways after a checkered past. The pub landlord said giving Ms Grainger 'the gift of life' has made him change his ways . Mr Joyce, centre, pictured on holiday in Malaga, Spain in 2001 shortly before joining the British Army, aged 19 . The father-of-four, from Worcester, said: 'When I was younger the dad of a lad I went to school with took me to the Wolves ground. 'He had a heart and lung transplant and I thought if he hadn't, he wouldn't have known me and I wouldn't be the person I am today. 'I looked at her story and it got to me a bit. I looked at her children and I could not imagine the mums of my children not being there for them. 'I thought, ""I need to change my life a little bit"" as I’ve not been a good boy all my life. 'I’ve done good things and bad things but I thought, let’s do good from now on. 'This is a good place to start. Let’s save someone’s life.' Mr Wesley told how he had turned his life around after being jailed for four years for grievous bodily harm in 2004. He said: 'When I was about 21 and 22 I was a bit of a bad boy. I was mischievous to say the least. 'I was always getting drunk and fighting and getting into trouble with the police. I was pretty violent and a bit of a rogue. Mr Joyce, a father-of-four, said: 'I've done good things and bad things but I thought, let's do good from now on. This is a good place to start. Let's save someone's life' My Joyce was jailed for a section 18 disorder and spent time at Blakenhurst prison, his ID pictured . 'Then I got jailed for a Section 18 disorder and spent time at Blakenhurst prison where I vowed never to go back. I hurt somebody very badly, that's all I'll say about that, . 'I was out in two years for good behaviour and wanted to get my life back on track and then I saw the story about Sally-Anne. 'I wanted to prove that despite chequered pasts there is always a light at the end of the tunnel if you want there to be. 'I didn't want to get caught on that slippery slope and hope I am really proof that bad guys can turn good.' Mr Joyce had to undergo a series of tests to check if he was suitable to be a donor for Ms Grainger. When results revealed he was the perfect match, doctors asked him whether he wanted to go ahead with the two-hour operation. Cystic fibrosis is a life-shortening inherited disease, affecting more than 10,000 people in the UK. It is not a condition a person can catch, those diagnosed with the disease are born with it. It is inherited and caused by a faulty gene, which controls the movement of salt and water in and out of the cells in a person's body. The lungs and digestive system become clogged with mucus, making it hard to breathe and digest food. More than 2.5million people in the UK carry the faulty gene, around one in 25 of the population. There is currently no cure for cystic fibrosis but many treatments exist to help manage symptoms, including physiotherapy, exercise, medication and nutrition. HOwever in more severe cases, sufferers will go on to require a lung transplant. To find out more about the condition visit the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. He added: 'I’m not letting anyone down. I’m saving this woman’s life. 'I’m nervous but I’m not nervous for me, You’ve got one life so live it the best you can. 'I believe what will be will be. I’ve lived my life. I’ve done everything I need to do and I’ve got four beautiful children. 'It’s time for me to let someone else live her life. I can’t have this lady’s children losing their mum. 'When I went for my scans, my 15-year-old messaged me and said I’m so proud of you for what you are going through and what you are doing. 'That’s all I need and to see a smile on Sally-Anne’s face when it’s all over. 'To know that her children are growing up with their mother and I’ve had a little help towards that. 'I just want to meet her now to say I’m going to do my best for you and I’m not going to let you down. I will do everything I physically can to help you. 'Life’s too short and I’m not having someone die at 34 - not if I can help it.' Ms Grainger told of her delight at finding a match, and is set to undergo the operation at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital in the next few months. The 34-year-old, who lives three mimles from Mr Joyce, in Wardon Villages, Worcestershire, said he was giving her the 'gift of life'.

"By . Lizzie Parry . Prostate cancer could be a sexually transmitted disease caused by an infection passed on during intercourse, scientists have said. Researchers at the University of California discovered a sexually transmitted infection called trichomoniasis helps the growth of cancer cells in human prostate cells, when grown in a laboratory. But the team behind the discovery say more research is now needed to confirm the link. Researchers at the University of California have discovered that men infected with the sexually transmitted infection  trichomoniasis are more susceptible to developing prostate cancer. The study found the infection encourages the growth of cancer cells in prostate cells (pictured under the microscope) And experts at Cancer Research UK told . the BBC that more clinical studies are needed before the disease can be . added to the list of cancers caused by STIs. Trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection, affecting around 275 million people across the world. Many people suffering the effects of the infection will have no symptoms. For those that do, they develop after around a month and for women cause soreness and itching around the vagina as well as a change in vaginal discharge. Infected men may feel itching or irritation in the penis, pain during urination as well as a white discharge from the penis. In the new study, Professor Patricia Johnson found the . parasite that causes trichomoniasis - Trichomonas vaginalis - secretes a . protein that causes inflammation and increased growth and invasion of . benign and cancerous prostate cells. A study carried out in 2006 at Washington University discovered men infected with trichomoniasis have a 40 per cent greater chance of developing prostate cancer. A study carried out in 2006 at Washington University discovered men infected with trichomoniasis have a 40 per cent greater chance of developing prostate cancer. The STI is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection, affecting around 275million people across the world each year . Prostate cancer is now the most common cancer in men in the UK. More than 41,700 men are diagnosed across the country each year. The disease tends to be rare in men under the age of 50, and more than half of cases are diagnosed in men over the age of 70. Age is the greatest risk factor, the older a man the more likely it is that he will develop the disease. In old age around eight in 10 men have prostate cancer cells in their prostate. In the UK, about one in nine men will get prostate cancer at some point in their lives. If . a man has a father or brother diagnosed with the disease they are two . to three times more likely of developing prostate cancer, compared to . the average man. The age at . which a relative is diagnosed, affects a man's risk - if a relative is . diagnosed at a young age, it may be a sign of a faulty gene causing the . cancer. Men who have . relatives with breast cancer may also be at greater risk of developing . the disease, particularly if their relative is diagnosed younger than . 60. Scientists have . been working to identify genes that may increase the risk of prostate . cancer. In 2008, Cancer Research UK scientists discovered seven gene . changes that increase a man's risk of developing the disease. Some studies have found a link between an increased risk of prostate cancer in men who have had colon cancer. Source: Cancer Research UK . Siobhan Sutcliffe, who led the research, . urged caution at the time, adding the link she found was 'not . conclusive' comparing the science to the early connections drawn between . smoking and lung cancer. Speaking at the time, she said: 'It's still in a really exploratory phase.' A subsequent study found no connection . between the STI and prostate cancer, while another at Havard University . found an even greater likelihood of cancer in infected men than the 2006 . study. Research in 2009 discovered a quarter of men with prostate cancer showed signs of having been infected with the STI, and were also found to have more advanced tumours. The new study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, now suggests the infection might make men more vulnerable to developing prostate cancer, though does not provide proof of the link. The team have called for more research to build on their work, to work towards proving the link. Nicola Smith, health information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: 'This study suggests a possible way the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis could encourage prostate cancer cells to grow and develop more quickly. 'But the research was only done in the lab, and previous evidence in patients failed to show a clear link between prostate cancer and this common sexually transmitted infection. 'There's been a lot of research into prostate cancer risk and we're working hard to piece together the puzzle. 'But . there are still no known lifestyle factors that seem to affect the risk . of developing the disease - and no convincing evidence for a link with . infection.'","Researchers at the University of California have discovered a link between the STI trichomoniasis and the growth of cancer cells in the prostate .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Shelling out for a smart TV doesn’t come cheap, with prices reaching into the tens of thousands. But a Which? investigation has revealed that the money could be wasted as soon as the manufacturer releases its next range, and ditches support for its older models. It found popular apps and services, such as Netflix and BBC iPlayer, can be removed on models that are only a year or two old - and often without notice. An investigation by Which? magazine discovered customers can lose services when manufacturers release new smart TVs. Manufacturers pay licenses to host apps, and this means they don't always choose to cover app licenses for older products. This graphic reveals which apps are supported on LG and Panasonic sets . When a TV manufacturer updates its . smart TV range, the whole operating system it runs on can potentially . change to incorporate new features.

If they can't agree, or either party changes their technology or software, consumers can lose services.

Keeping apps such as BBC iPlayer and Netflix available on smart TVs requires an agreement between manufacturers and app providers. If they can't agree, or either party changes their technology or software, consumers lose out . This also goes the other way - if a TV was sold before an app becomes available, it’s unlikely the developers will ever make it backward compatible, meaning it will never work on models released before the app launched. In some cases, manufacturers refuse to guarantee the availability of apps on their smart TVs, acknowledging they may be removed without notice. It’s not just about time and money, though. Apps have ‘optimum environments’ in which they work. This means that a particular app, such as Netflix, may have been designed to work on a device with a minimum processing power and screen resolution. In some cases, manufacturers refuse to guarantee the availability of apps on their smart TVs. According to the report 'manufacturers blame the app providers, the app providers blame the manufacturers, and the retailers blame everyone but themselves. Yet in the middle of this, consumers can lose out' If an older TV doesn’t meet these requirements, customers will get a poorer experience and Netflix could develop a reputation for providing a sub-standard service. According to the Which? investigation, ‘manufacturers blame the app providers, the app providers blame the manufacturers, and the retailers blame everyone but themselves. ‘Yet in the middle of this, consumers can lose out. Since the product itself hasn’t developed a physical fault, it’s a grey area for consumer rights.'

"By . Emma Innes . A mother has been left unable to chew food and is facing a £20,000 dental bill after dentists filled her teeth so many times they disintegrated. Emma Tait, 30, began visiting the dentist at the age of ten and says she had had all of her teeth filled by the time she was just 13 after years of not brushing her teeth properly. But the administration assistant claims NHS dentists continued re-fill her teeth instead of crowning them, causing them all to crumble. Emma Tait, 30, says her teeth have been filled so many times they have started to crumble . She says she is now facing a £20,000 dentistry bill in order to be able to sit and enjoy a meal with her partner and two children. The mother has been left unable to chew meals after all of her molars fell out and a dentist has now told her this wouldn’t have happened if the teeth had been crowned rather than refilled. She said: ‘When I was in my mid-20s a dentist said to me that it was a shame dentists didn’t give me crowns when I was younger. ‘They probably just assumed that I wouldn’t have wanted to pay for them because I was quite young, but it could have saved my teeth. ‘It takes me a lot longer than everyone else to eat a meal and I have to chew everything lots of times. ‘It normally takes me a good half an hour to eat my dinner - usually everyone is still waiting for me to finish. Ms Tait says the state of her teeth has severely affected her confidence . ‘It gets to the point that my jaw is so painful I just give up eating - salad is the worst because you have to chew it so many times. ‘It is a pain but I’ve kind of just got used to it over the years. Eating anything like tough meat is pretty much completely out of the question. ‘It can quite often be painful but it goes through stages and it has got to the point now where I don’t notice it as much as I used to. ‘I have a lot of problems with my gums as well - they quite often bleed and they are sore and painful.’ Ms Tait, from Weston-super-Mare, has now decided to ditch the NHS and go private in an attempt reinstate her teeth. She claims her remaining teeth will need to be restored at the cost of £11,000 and a brace will have to be fitted, with a price tag of £4,000. Ms Tait says her teeth are now in such a bad way she is being left with little choice but to pay for extensive dental work which could cost as much as £20,000 . Experts are then hopeful she can be fitted with two implants at a sum of £4,600 - allowing her to chew food once again. Though excited about the prospect of being able to smile with pride again, Ms Tait says she is worried about financing the treatment. She said: ‘I only have front teeth left on the bottom now and all of my top teeth are starting to fall out which is what spurred me on to find out what I can do to save them. ‘They basically told me that the best thing I can do now is have a brace fitted to put the teeth I have left into the position they should be in - then I’ll be able to have dentures. ‘But before I can have braces my teeth need to be secured so the fillings need to be redone and ideally they need to be crowned. ‘I was originally quoted £11,000 to have all the work done before the brace just to stabilise all the teeth I do have. ‘Paying is going to be a problem - I think we’re going to have to take it as it comes but I have looked into taking finance out and then more finance once that’s run out. ‘I can’t afford it but at the same time I need teeth really.’ Ms Tait claims that the treatment will not only enable her to eat a meal with her loved ones, but it will also boost her diminishing confidence. She said: ‘I have always considered myself to have bad teeth - I really don’t like smiling. Because of the way my teeth are my lips don’t come together. ‘It does affect my confidence - I don’t like to smile because I feel like I look like a horse. ‘The aim is to get the work started next month getting all the root treatments and stuff done - hopefully that will put my teeth in a temporary state of health ready to have a brace fitted.’ Ms Tait does not know how she is going to fund her dental work but says she has no choice but to find the money as she is struggling to eat . Though it has been recommended Ms Tait takes legal action against the NHS she said this was not something she is keen to do. She said: ‘It has been recommended to me that I could take the case further. ‘But I don’t really want to take them to court because I know then I’ll have to pay for a solicitor. ‘It could be that I lose my case and I’ve then wasted money which could be spent on new teeth.’ Commenting on Ms Tait's case, Dr Uchenna Okoye clinical director of London Smiling, said: 'If you are able to fill a tooth, it is better for the nerve to do so as it is less destructive than using a crown. 'However, there comes a time when you need to have a crown to stabilise the tooth. 'You can think of it as the difference between a soft elastic bandage to support a sprain and having an actual break that needs the support of a proper cast.'","Emma Tait says all her teeth had been filled by the time she was 13 .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . For more than three years, Apple and Samsung have been at loggerheads over patent infringements, but the war could soon be coming to an end. Reports in the Korea Times claim the tech giants have agreed to begin talks to settle such disputes out of court. The claims come after a jury awarded both companies damages during a high-profile court battle earlier this month, which made it easier to resume talks. Apple and Samsung are reportedly in talks to bring their long-standing patent battle to an end. Sources 'directly involved in the matter' said a recent court ruling which said they were both at fault, to varying degrees, made it easier for talks to resume. Although more time will be needed for the two firms to fix terms regarding royalties . The latest case began on . 31 March and a jury concluded both firms were at fault to varying degrees. In 2010 Apple began by suing Samsung, but the Korean firm counter-sued just . days later. Apple then secured an injunction to restrict sales of . Samsung’s Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Europe. In . July 2012, Apple was told to publicly state Samsung hadn't copied its designs, but in August 2012 Apple won $1 billion . in damages. These damages were then dropped from $1 billion (£593 . million) to around $800 million (£475 million). In June last year, . the International Trade Commission ruled iPads infringed on Samsung . patents and  should be banned in the U.S. This ruling was vetoed two months later. A retrial began in November that Apple won, but Samsung appealed. Sources ‘directly involved in the . matter’ told the Korea Times: ‘Some more time will be needed to fix . terms of details such as royalty payments in return for using patents . owned by each before reaching a full agreement.’ The two tech giants have been battling over patent lawsuits since 2010. Each company accuses the other of stealing and using hardware and software features from their respective handsets. The latest battle was brought by Apple and involved at least 10 patent software infringements from the ‘slide to unlock’ feature, to Face Time and video calls. The court case began at the end of March, and at the start of this month a California jury reached a mixed verdict. The eight-person jury agreed Samsung had infringed two Apple software patents, awarding the company a total of $119.6 million. But the jury also found in favour of Samsung in its counterclaim, awarding the firm $158,400 for the infringement of one patent. The $119.6 million is barely more than five per cent of the $2.2 billion in damages Apple asked of the court. The latest case between the two companies was brought by Apple and concerned software infringements, including the 'slide to unlock' feature, pictured. A jury agreed Samsung infringed two Apple patents, and awarded $119.6 million, but also found in favour of Samsung, awarding it $158,400 . It is also much less than the $930 million Apple was awarded in 2012 in the same court, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, in San Jose. The move comes just days after Apple and Google bought a similar three-year battle to an end by issuing a statement saying they will be dismissing all patent disputes. The most recent disputes applied to patents Google inherited when it bought Motorola Mobility in 2012.","The two tech giants have been battling over patent lawsuits since 2010 .

"By . Mark Prigg . Google has finally lifted the veil of secrecy from its driverless car. The firm allowed reporters to take a trip around Google's HQ in Silicon Valley. The project's boss urged people to 'embrace' the car, which has caused safety concerns. Scroll down for video . A Google self-driving car, a white Lexus, cruised along a road near the Google campus, braking for pedestrians and scooting over in its lane to give bicyclists ample space as the firm let journalists ride in the car for the first time. Mean streets: Google cars have driven about 700,000 accident-free miles (1.1 million km)  on motorways in 'autonomous mode'. Google has been focusing on city driving for the past year. To-do list: Google's Lexus RX450H SUVs are retrofitted with lasers, radar and cameras rapidly learned how to handle thousands of urban driving situations.  Improvements are needed in merging and lane changes, turning right on red and handling bad weather. Local tests: So far, the tech giant has focused on street driving in Mountain View, California. The state, along with, Nevada, Florida, Michigan  and Washington, D.C., have formally opened public streets to testing of self-driving cars. The future is (almost) here: In 2012, Google co-founder Sergey Brin predicted that the public would be able to get hold of the technology within five years. This prediction has not been revised. Google, the carmaker: While Google has enough money to invest in making cars, that likelihood is remote.  Industry experts believe more likely options include collaborating with major car makers or giving away the software, as Google did with its Android operating system. A fleet of Google's robot cars ferried more than two dozen reporters around Mountain View, California, on Tuesday, in 30-minute ride-alongs that showcased their ability to automatically and safely navigate around city streets packed with cyclists, pedestrians and traffic signs. The demonstrations, along with a morning of press briefings by Google managers developing the technology, marked the company's most concerted effort to date to provide an up-close look at the cars conceived five years ago in its secretive Google X division. The public needs to understand that a self-driving car is 'not something that you need to fear but something you need to embrace,' said Ron Medford, a former National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration official who is now director of safety for Google's self-driving car project. 'We do find that when people experience it, we get remarkable results and responses,' Medford said at the event at the Computer History Museum, during which Google explained the technology that makes the cars work. What Google's car sees: An interior view of a Google self-driving car showing the video and the data the car uses to 'see' the road. Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin tout the driverless car as revolutionary technology that could eventually sharply reduce fatalities on the road. ‘You can count on one hand the number of years until people, ordinary people, can experience this,' company co-founder Sergey Brin said in 2012. He made the remarks at a ceremony where California Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation legalising the cars on public roads in the state. It would be hard to mistake the gold Lexus RX 450h cars that Google has converted into self-driving prototypes for normal cars, primarily because of the roof-mounted laser sensor that revolves 10 times a second, gathering a 360-degree view of the car's surroundings.Other drivers who spot the self-driving car often swerve in front of it and tap on their brakes, hoping to gauge the Google car's reaction, according to the two Google staffers in the car's front seats. Another favorite involves car drivers waving their hands in the air, in an attempt to get the Google driver-seat staff member to take his or her own hands off the wheel and prove the car is really steering itself. 'We just laugh at them,' said one of the Google staff members in the car. From the car's backseat, the ride feels little different from sitting in a taxi. The car's speed, the distance it maintains from the vehicle in front and its handling, for the most part, feel completely ordinary. Changing lanes occasionally feels sharper than typical, and the car slowed down at a green light at one point until its sensors were able to 'read' a traffic light that was apparently mounted at an odd angle.The Google staff member in the driver's seat never took control of the car, other than the initial passage through a speed bump-laden parking lot, and once again on arrival. Alexei Oreskovic, Reuters . But it remains to be seen whether it's ready for widespread use. Lately, some of Google's ambitious 'moonshot' projects have stirred unease. Google Glass, a postage stamp-sized computer screen that attaches to eyeglass frames and is capable of recording video, has raised privacy concerns. For self-driving cars, consumer acceptance and regulation may be as much issues as perfecting the technology. Sensors including radar and lasers create 3D maps of a self-driving car's surroundings in real-time, while Google's software sorts objects into four categories. These include moving vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists and static objects such as signs, curbs and parked cars. Initially, the car’s capabilities were fairly crude. A group of pedestrians on a street corner registered as a single person. Now, the technology can distinguish individuals, according to Google spokeswoman Courtney Hohne. To deal with cyclists, engineers initially programmed the software to look for hand gestures that indicate an upcoming turn. Then they realised that most cyclists don't use standard gestures - and still others weave down a road the wrong way. A camera peers out from the front grill of Google's self-driving car in Mountain View, California, as Google revealed exactly how the car works . Engineers have taught the software to predict the behaviour of cyclists based on thousands of encounters during the approximately 10,000 miles (16,000 km) the cars have driven autonomously on city streets, Hohne said. The software projects a cyclist's likely movements and plots the car's path accordingly - then reacts if something unexpected happens. ‘A mile of city driving is much more complex than a mile of freeway driving, with hundreds of different objects moving according to different rules of the road in a small area,’ Urmson wrote. Before recent breakthroughs, Google had considered mapping all the world's stop signs. Now the technology can read stop signs, including those held in the hands of school crossing guards, Hohne added. Google will not say whether it will build its own cars or license the technology to automakers, nor will it provide a firm date for when the cars will be available. Co-founder Brin has said the technology could be available by 2017. Google's cars have never 'caused' an accident in self-driving mode, although they have been involved in a few fender benders, such as an incident in which a Google car stopped at a red light got rear-ended, said Chris Urmson, the head of Google's self-driving car project. Unlike human drivers, self-driving cars never get drowsy behind the wheel, and they can react to unforeseen situations much more quickly, he said.","Reporters allowed to experience Google car for first time .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . It seems everyone is jumping on the virtual reality bandwagon - from Sony to Microsoft to, more surprisingly, Facebook. The main problem with the technology, however, is its price. To solve this, a Polish firm has developed a cheap headset that takes advantage of the technology found in everyday phones. Called Vrizzmo, it uses rounded lenses and apps to show 3D images, and head movements are tracked using the phone’s built-in gyroscope. The Vrizzmo headset, pictured, was unveiled at Poland's Digital Dragons by makers De JET Works. It consists of straps and a plastic case for phones with 4.7-inch screens or larger. The phone is strapped in front of the wearer's face and rounded lenses separate the display to appear in front of each eye, causing a 3D effect . Variations of virtual reality have been around for years, in particular in flight and driving simulators, but it's popularity has risen recently due to companies such as Oculus VR. Its Oculus Rift headset began life as a . Kickstarter project and was bought by Facebook earlier this year in a . deal said to be worth around $2 billion. A consumer version is expected later this year. Sony announced its own headset, under Project Morpheus, in March. The . adjustable device features a head-mounted display with 1080p HD . resolution and a 90-degree field of view, while sensors built into the . headset track head movements. In April, Microsoft bought smart glasses specialist Osterhout Design Group and rumours suggest its working on its own augmented and virtual reality gadget for players of its Xbox One. The harness was developed by De JET Works, which recently demonstrated the technology at Poland’s Digital Dragons event. While development kits for one of the most well-known headsets, Oculus Rift, start at $350 (€254 or £207), the Vrizzmo is expected to retail for just €50 ($68 or £40). The Vrizzmo headset consists of rubber straps and a plastic case for phones with 4.7-inch screens or larger. The phone is strapped in front of the wearer’s face and rounded lenses separate the display to appear in front of each eye. Apps show each eye different versions of the same image to create 3D, stereoscopic effect. This effect, as well as any potential lag, then depends on the quality of the phone’s processor, accelerometer and gyroscope. De JET Works said it is hoping to officially launch the device ‘later this summer’, but a developer kit could be released as early as next month. It is also working on a series of games . including a zombie shooter currently being used during demonstrations. Others include a flying, and racing game. Samsung could be about to enter the virtual reality race, if reports about an upcoming headset are true. The Korean firm is said to have sent early prototypes to developers to test, and the final product could launch by the end of the year. It would rival Sony's Project Morpheus headset, pictured .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . The battle of the instant messaging apps has taken a twist today after reports claim Facebook is working on a Snapchat rival. The tech giant - which famously tried to buy Snapchat earlier this year - already has its own Messenger app, but rumours suggest it is planning to release a video-chat service, called Slingshot, later this month. Like Snapchat, Slingshot would let users . send short video messages by tapping the screen after selecting one or . several contacts from their list of Facebook friends. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg (pictured) is said to be preparing to take the site into a video-messaging war with rivals Snapchat and Vine. Rumours suggest the company has been working on a video-sharing app called Slingshot - and it might be released later this month . The move . comes as both Vine and Snapchat have attempted to eat away at Facebook’s . share of the messaging market with their Vine Messages and Chat updates . respectively. It’s no secret that some of the world’s biggest social networks are now locked in an instant messaging war. A month ago Vine announced a messaging ability for its popular video-sharing service, dubbed Vine Messages. And a few weeks ago Snapchat unveiled Chat, allowing users to send messages to each other on the app for the first time. Facebook’s newest update would be a strike back at its rivals. The rumours claim Mark Zuckerberg and his team have been working on the idea for several months, as Facebook attempts to separate various services out into different apps rather than combining them into one. Back . in February, Facebook bought hugely popular messaging app WhatsApp for . $14.6 billion (£8.7 billion), after failing in a previous $3 billion (£1.8 billion) bid to . buy Snapchat. At the start of April, Vine revealed its Vine Messages service that lets users send messages to each other. This . directly followed once-popular social network Bebo’s attempts to get . back into the game with Blab, their own video messaging service. At the start of May, Snapchat then unveiled 'Chat', a messaging service within the app that enabled users to send messages that, like photos and videos, are deleted after they're seen. Facebook, . meanwhile, is busy trying to increase the profile of its Messenger app, . with rumours that it will shift WhatsApp users onto its native . messaging client. They recently announced a selfie feature for Messenger that makes it easier to send people pictures of yourself. And . even Twitter is getting in on the game – it’s rumoured they are . considering letting users have secret conversations on the site. Slingshot is a direct response to Snapchat’s Chat (left) and Vine Messages (right), both of which were released in the last month in an attempt to draw users away from Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp . Talking to the Financial Times, sources said the app could be launched this month - although, as of yet there’s no official word from Facebook. The move would follow Zuckerberg’s unsuccessful attempt to purchase Snapchat in late 2013 for $3 billion (£1.8 billion). Instead, earlier this year Facebook bought WhatsApp for a whopping $14.6 billion (£8.7 billion) in cash and stock. Despite the purchase, the move to provide users with simple ways to communicate is seen as a necessity as Facebook faces competition on all fronts. Aside from the big-hitters a number of other apps like WeChat and Line are threatening to eat away at the Silicon Valley-based company. Facebook acquired WhatsApp earlier this year for $14.6 billion (£8.7 billion) in cash and stock to complement its existing Facebook Messenger service. Further rumours suggest the company is planning to migrate all WhatsApp users onto Facebook Messenger . This isn’t the first time Facebook has made moves in these markets though. Earlier this year they quietly removed two unpopular services on the iOS App Store – Poke and Facebook Camera. The former, building on the once popular feature of its main website, was very similar to Snapchat and allowed users to send each other brief video messages. The latter, meanwhile, was an attempt to rival Instagram and provide photographers with a means to applying filters to and editing their images.","Sources claim Facebook could release a video-messaging app 'this month'

"By . Ryan Lipman . Former independent MP Rob Oakeshott has made the stunning revelation that he once tried persuading Liberal MP Malcolm Turnbull to become a Labor minister. Mr Oakeshott had hoped to see a Labor-led minority government, which mixed party boundary lines, while he was in talks with Julia Gillard after the 2010 election left a hung parliament. Mr Oakeshott claims that during the period he had many private conversations with Mr Turnbull and proposed the idea of the now-Communications Minister joining cabinet in a Gillard-led minority government. Scroll down for video . What could have been: Former MP Rob Oakeshott claims he approached Malcolm Turnbull after the 2010 election to propose he join the Labor party . Mr Oakeshott, pictured with Julia Gillard, envisaged a Labor-led minority government, which mixed party boundary lines . The details are revealed in Mr Oakeshott's memoir, The Independent Member for Lyne, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. The former MP's memoir recounts an intense 17-day period following the election which thrust the balance of power in the hands of Mr Oakeshott and fellow independents Bob Katter and Tony Windsor. He claims to have sounded Mr Turnbull out over the extraordinary move. 'I tell him I would only consider being a minister in a Labor government if there were others who joined me,' Mr Oakeshott writes of Mr Turnbull in the memoir. 'I am now testing the waters with Malcolm, to see if he wants to be a minister in a Labor government, if he does I would be happy to propose it. The former MP has made a series of revelations in his memoir The Independent Member for Lyne . While Mr Oakeshott has admitted the conversations were nothing more than flirtatious, Mr Turnbull claims he can not remember the proposal ever being made. In the memoir, the former MP also exposes James Packer's attempts to lobby him on a tour of the billionare's Crown Casino in 2012, when controversial gambling reforms were being discussed by the Gillard government. The former politician said after sharing a meal, the casino mogul put the pressure on by making it clear he was very close with senior government members Stephen Conroy and Mark Arbib. According to the claims, Mr Packer also told Mr Oakeshott he would use his network to protect his business if he needed to would hurt the government badly. Mr Arbib, who resigned from politics in 2012, now works for Mr Packer and has refuted Mr Oakeshott's claims.

"By . Mark Prigg . Government regulators said that they have approved Nest Labs' plans to fix a feature in its smoke alarms that could prevent them from sounding immediately. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said the online fix provided by the firm fixes the issue - and the company aid it plans to put the Nest Protect back on sale 'within weeks'. The high-tech home monitoring device company, which was acquired this year by Google for $3.2 billion, halted all new sales of the alarms in April after recognizing the problem. The $129 Nest Protect sensor, which was pulled from sale today after the firm admitted a wave of the hand could switch it off under some circumstances . The Nest Protect has Smoke and Carbon Monoxide sensors built in, along with a computer with wifi connection. It speaks to owners, telling them where the danger is and what the problem is. Before it sounds a piercing alarm, Nest Protect gives you a friendly Heads-Up warning that you can silence with a wave of your hand - until now. It integrates with your mobile devices and even messages you if the batteries run low, avoiding that all-too-familiar midnight low-battery chirp. The company announced last month that it would offer an electronic update to disable this feature. It has not received any related reports of incidents, injuries or property damage, it said. Nest says the device must be connected to the Internet and linked to an account for an automatic update. Consumers whose devices are already connected should confirm receipt of the update by going to ""Nest Sense"" on their account and ensuring the button for ""Nest Wave"" is set to off and grayed out. Those who have not connected their devices to a wireless network and a Nest account should do so. Test founds users could potentially turn off the sensor unintentionally with a wave of the hand. The firm warned existing users to switch off the 'gesture control' feature while it worked on a fix. Nest co-founder and Chief Executive Tony Faddell said that, under a unique set of circumstances the alarm's 'Nest Wave' feature, which allows a user to switch off the device with a wave of the hand, could be inadvertently activated. Faddell, one of the creators of Apple Inc's iPod, apologized in the blogpost for a problem that was discovered during recent laboratory testing. He added that no customer had complained so far. 'We observed a unique combination of circumstances that caused us to question whether the Nest Wave could be unintentionally activated,' he wrote. 'This could delay an alarm going off if there was a real fire,' he said. 'The fact that it could even potentially happen is extremely important to me and I want to address it immediately.' He did not specify that set of circumstances. The sensor can be controlled with an app - or by gesture control . The firm proudly showed off the gesture feature at launch - but will now disable it . Nest will immediately disable the Wave feature - one of many innovative design elements that has won the company and its devices acclaim - in all smoke alarms that are WiFi-connected while it works on a software update to fix the possible defect. It said the fix, plus regulatory approvals, could take two to three months to complete. Customers without WiFi-connected devices should either disable it or return it for a full refund, the company added. Nest halted all sales of its smoke alarms to prevent customers from buying a device that would need an immediate software patch. Google announced plans in January to acquire Nest via its second largest deal, to expand into a broader array of devices and bring valuable hardware design expertise in-house. Nest gained a large following with its first thermostat - a round, brushed-metal device with a convex screen that displays temperature and changes hue to match the color of the wall it attaches to.

"Early autopsy results suggest skeletal remains discovered on a Nepalese mountainside do belong to missing West Australian man Matt Allpress. Friends and family raised the alarm in November after the 23-year-old failed to arrive in Sydney following a solo 10-day trek in the country's Annapurna ranges. Human remains were found on May 10 and his parents, Margaret and Mark Allpress, travelled to Pokhara police station in Nepal last week, where they confirmed clothing and personal items found nearby belonged to their son. Scroll down for video . Doctor's early autopsy results suggest skeletal remains found on a Nepalese mountainside were of missing 23-year-old West Australian man Matt Allpress . On Thursday, Mrs Allpress went to the Kathmandu hospital where doctors have been examining the remains. 'The doctors advised that their preliminary findings were that the remains were of Matthew Allpress based on the dental and medical records provided by the family,' read a message posted on the Find Matt Facebook page on Friday evening. 'Mark and Margaret thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers ... they do appreciate your support.' A 15-strong team of Nepalese police will now travel to the mountainous region where the remains were discovered in a bid to retrieve Mr Allpress's remaining belongings. Tributes have begun to flow for the young adventurer on social media. Mr Allpress was reported missing six months ago after failing to return from a solo 10-day hiking trek in Nepal . 'Matthew you were (a) wonderful young man with your whole life ahead of you. May you now enjoy life amongst the stars,' Donna Garvey Noonan wrote. Another friend, Jane Suckling, wrote that Mr Allpress had left a 'hole in all of the hearts he touched'. Part of the remains, along with samples of his parents' DNA, will be sent to Melbourne for additional testing. Mark and Margaret also hope the cause of his death will be determined. Nepal police are planning to do further searches in the area where he was found to try and locate his backpack which is currently unaccounted for. Family and friends updated follower on Friday via the Facebook page 'Find Matt' MailOnline reported earlier in the week that human remains were located on Saturday by two local Nepalese people foraging in the mountains above Sikles, about one hour off the main track.

"By . Associated Press . WASHINGTON (AP) — In a second-term Cabinet reshuffle, President Barack Obama tapped San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro on Friday to be the nation's next housing secretary, giving a prominent national platform to one of the Democratic Party's most celebrated up-and-comers. Joined by Castro and Vice President Joe Biden, Obama also announced he was nominating current Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan to run the White House budget office — an opening Obama created when he asked his former budget chief to take over the Health and Human Services Department last month. 'Just because you are of modest means does not mean that your aspirations or your opportunity ought to be limited, and it certainly means you can have the talent to succeed and achieve the American Dream,' Castro said as he accepted the nomination in the State Dining Room of the White House. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama has nominated San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro (L) to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development and replace current Secretary Shaun Donovan (C) Donovan (R) is moving on to the White House to helm the Office and Management and Budget, a post that Health and Human Services Secretary-designee Sylvia Burwell last held . Castro rocketed to party stardom in 2012 with a coveted keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention -- much like Barack Obama did in 2004 . The 39-year-old Castro was propelled into the national spotlight two years ago when Obama chose him to deliver the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention — a political baptism by fire not unlike the president's own rise to prominence when Obama keynoted the 2004 convention. Friday's announcement gives another major boost to Castro's profile, just as Democrats are eyeing him as a potential vice presidential candidate in 2016. As a Democrat, Castro's options for climbing the political ladder were severely constrained in Texas, where every statewide office is held by a Republican and Democrats haven't won a statewide race in 20 years. In elevating Castro to a Cabinet-level post, Obama gives Castro perhaps his best chance to establish his credibility nationally as Democrats seek to shore up a bench of promising candidates for future races. 'The national scene in Washington is where politicians go to cut their teeth for any sort of national aspirations,' said Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist who advised Hillary Rodham Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. 'This will give him an opportunity to show off what he can do.' Castro, who is Mexican-American, would become one of the highest-ranking Hispanic officials in government if confirmed by the Senate. He comes to Washington with a compelling personal narrative:  The son of a single mother, he attended Harvard Law School before serving three terms as San Antonio's mayor. His identical twin brother, Democrat Joaquin Castro, represents Texas in Congress. Referring to Castro as an 'all-star,' Obama urged the Senate to confirm both Castro and Donovan quickly and without games. 'They are proven leaders. They are proven managers. They are going to be effective and most importantly, they've got huge heart,' Obama said. Donovan, 48, is highly regarded inside the White House as a strong manager. He is an affordable housing advocate whose work overseeing the federal government's response to the destruction Hurricane Sandy unleashed on the East Coast in October 2012 has earned glowing praise from White House officials, including Obama. Dynasty in waiting? Julian Castro (L) is brother to Joaquin Castro (R), a Texas congressman . 'Julián ha vivido el Sueño Americano,' Obama said proudly of Castro on Friday, 'and it¿s precisely because he¿s lived out the American Dream that he¿ll work his tail off to make sure more people can travel that same path' Elephant in the room: Castro's pick may be a move to watch him and determine if he's vice-presidential timber for 2016 . Obama praised Donovan for making the agency more efficient, saving taxpayer dollars and building strong neighborhoods that have reduced homelessness. 'Here's the problem: When you're good at your job, people always want you to do even more,' Obama said. As director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, Donovan would have influence over administration policy and spending. If confirmed by the Senate as expected, Donovan will replace Sylvia Mathews Burwell, whom Obama recently tapped to become secretary of Health and Human Services following Kathleen Sebelius' resignation and the fallout from the disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. Burwell is awaiting confirmation. Obama had sought to bring Castro into the administration in the past, but he decided to stay in the job he says he looked forward to while growing up. Castro handily won a third term in San Antonio last year. Javier Palomarez, president and chief executive officer of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said Castro is a 'visionary leader' who has done more than anyone in San Antonio to address the city's housing needs. 'Mayor Castro is not only an exemplary leader within the Hispanic community, but by all measure, a well-suited candidate to lead the department,' Palomarez said. 'With great consistency, Mayor Castro has set aside political partisanship in the name of good policy decision making. We hope his confirmation process will proceed with that same collaborative spirit.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Castro is considered a possible vice-presidential choice for the Democrats, who are eager to expand their ethnic profile in power .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Gamers have garnered a reputation for being young males, typically late teens to early twenties, who are unemployed, loners - but the truth is somewhat different. A survey has discovered almost a fifth of gamers are women, a third are over 35, and 54 per cent are in relationships. And now a photographer has used these findings, combined with 2,000 portraits, to reveal the face of the nation’s average gamer. Scroll down for video . This is the face of the average gamer, as created by Chris Dorley-Brown. The photographer captured the faces of more than 2,000 people who attended a recent event for online game, RuneScape. He then morphed the images together to reveal 'Joe', pictured . Research from Domino's Pizza found that almost half of male gamers admitted . they have turned down sex to continue playing, while a fifth of female . gamers said they’d missed weddings and hen dos. Women even said they’d missed funerals . in order to play their games, yet almost 85 per cent of men said they . would never miss a stag do, wedding or important event. One in seven gamers confessed to relieving themselves in . an empty drinks bottle to avoid having to leave the room with gamers in . Birmingham among the worst offenders. Birmingham gamers also spend the most . money on gaming a year at £253 per person ahead of Liverpool on £228 and . Manchester on £223. Nicknamed Joe, the face was created by London-born Chris Dorley-Brown by morphing photos of gamers who recently attended an event for online game RuneScape. Dorley-Brown also created a time-lapse video revealing some of the faces that make up the average gamer. The gaming nation's profile was then compiled by studio Jagex from a survey of 1,157 gamers. This survey found gamers are more likely to be in full-time employment than non-gamers - 37 per cent compared with the UK average of 30 per cent. Gamers also have more cars, more money and take more holidays than non-gamers. By comparing the national average to the gaming survey, it found almost a third of gamers have two cars per household, more than the average 12 cars per 10 British households. Although Joe was designed to be androgynous, Dorley-Brown also created the average face of the male, pictured, and female gamer. An accompanying survey additionally found that a third of gamers are over 35, more than half are in relationships and 70% are homeowners . More than a third (36 per cent) of gamers go on at least one holiday abroad a year, compared to just 21 per cent of non-gamers. While 70 per cent of gamers earn at least . £20,000 per year - earning more than bank clerks - with close to 40 per . cent earning over £40,000 - more than police officers. Going . against the loner stereotype, too, the survey found over half of gamers (54 per cent) are in relationships, and almost a . third are more likely to meet people offline, at school or work.

"By . Meghan Keneally . Donald Sterling has stepped back from his defensive stance and agreed to pass controls of the LA Clippers basketball team to his wife. Donald Sterling and his estranged wife Shelly have joint ownership of the basketball team and the NBA made it clear that they were going to push for Donald to sell his portion in light of his racist recordings. Shelly has repeatedly announced that she has no plans to sell her portion of the team and she felt that she is in no position to be forced to sell her stake since it was her husband who made the racist comments while unknowingly being recorded by an alleged girlfriend. Scroll down for video . Throwing in the towel: Donald Sterling has reportedly handed over the control of his half of the NBA basketball team to his wife Shelly, who had control of the other half . Negotiations: Shelly Sterling, seen here with her attorney Pierce O'Donnell, has been in talks with the NBA ever since her husband's racist recordings were leaked in hopes that she can keep her half of the team . TMZ first reported on Friday that Donald has surrendered his controlling stake of the team and given it to his wife, which comes after repeated assertions that he would do no such thing. Shelly and her team of lawyers has reportedly been negotiating with the NBA separately from her husband since the scandal broke in an effort to insure that she is not faced with a force sale like her husband after he was issued a lifetime ban from professional basketball. 'Shelly Sterling's preference has always been to find a way to resolve this dispute amicably with the NBA in a mutually satisfactory manner,' her lawyer Pierce O'Donnell told TMZ, though he would not say anything further about the details of the sale. ESPN reports that the NBA has not formally accepted this arrangement and she may be forced to sell the team as one whole unit rather than being able to keep her own shares. NBC reported shortly after that Shelly has agreed to voluntarily agreed to sell the team. CNN followed up with a confirmation from an unidentified source familiar with the situation. On the sidelines: Shelly Sterling, seen at Thursday night's home game, will reportedly be handling the sale to keep it separate from her husband . The announcement comes after the NBA . filed charges that would force Sterling to terminate his ownership of . the team, and he was given five days to determine his response. That . deadline would expire on Tuesday, but he appears to have come to a . decision with a few days to spare- though it is not official whether or . not the NBA will accept his move, though it does seem likely considering . what NBA commissioner Adam Silver said at a press conference earlier . this week. 'Shelly Sterling's preference has always been to find a way to resolve this dispute amicably with the NBA in a mutually satisfactory manner' -Pierce O'Donnell, her attorney . 'It is . their team to sell, and so he knows what the league’s point of view is, . and so I’m sure if he wanted to sell the team on some reasonable . timetable, I’d prefer he sell it than we go through this process. So if . that’s what you mean by man‑to‑man, I’m open to that,' Silver said. They already ruled against his first request, which was to have a three month delay to evaluate his options, but it comes as no surprise that the NBA denied this as they hope to put the issue behind them for fear of losing fan support and the threat of a player walkout. Two other reasons for why the Sterlings may have been motivated to sell rather than bring the issue to a vote among the owners is that the owners may have convinced them that it would be worse for the league to do so. The clearest reason, however, is that the longer the Sterlings are associated with the team, the lower the team's selling price will be as sponsors continue to stay away from the Clippers and the players themselves are less likely to want to stay on board if there is no indication that the Sterlings will cut ties. One deadline on the horizon is the NBA draft in late June. The team would be less appealing to prospective players if the Sterlings are still associated with the team at that point, or if there is no clear sign that they are in the process of extracting themselves from the leadership positions. Speculation of who may buy the team continues to swirl, as moguls Oprah Winfrey, Larry Ellison and David Geffen have been reportedly considering the purchase, which is expected to have a price tag of about $1billion.","Donald and his estranged wife Shelly Sterling have a joint ownership of the LA Clippers and now she is reportedly in full control of the team .

"By . Phil Duncan . Follow @@PhilDuncanF1 . World Champion Sebastian Vettel will be keen to forget his 100th grand prix for Red Bull. The German’s season has been plagued by reliability issues and his bad luck struck once more in Monaco when he was forced to retire after seven laps with engine gremlins. ‘Come on, guys!’ a disgruntled Vettel shouted over the team radio before reeling in his anger: ‘I am sure you are trying everything,’ he added. The German has scored just 45 points this season. At the same stage last year he had 107 to his name. Frustration: Sebastian Vettel saw his 100th race for Red Bull end in an early retirement . British actor Benedict Cumberbatch conducted the post-race interviews. It was the second time he has appeared on the rostrum this season after posing the questions in Malaysia, too. It means Cumberbatch, best known for his role in BBC drama Sherlock, has been on the top steps on more occasions than Vettel this year. Guest: British actor Benedict Cumberbatch conducted the post-race podium interviews . Cumberbatch was among a host of celebrities who predictably flocked to the south of France for F1’s blue-riband event. Glen Johnson, Michael Carrick and Aaron Ramsey spearheaded the Premier League’s assault on the principality while Sir Patrick Stewart, Chris Evans and Pixie Lott were there from the world of show business. They were also joined by Justin Bieber. The popstar, not deterred by an embarrassing snub from Fernando Alosno on Saturday, then posed for a rather awkward ‘selfie’ with Bernie Ecclestone, 63 years his senior. Only in Monaco. Snap: Canadian singer Justin Bieber was one of a number of celebrities in attendance in Monaco . Marussia registered their first points-scoring result in Formula One after Jules Bianchi finished ninth yesterday. The Banbury-based team – who entered the sport as Virgin Racing in 2010 – completed the feat in their 83rd outing. Frenchman Bianchi actually finished eighth, but was demoted one place following a five-second timing penalty for serving an earlier penalty during the safety car period. Hero: Jules Bianchi finished ninth to score Marussia's first ever points in their Formula One history . Marussia’s rivals Caterham also secured the best result of their five-year history after Marcus Ericsson ended the race in 11th, but it is unlikely to dissuade owner Tony Fernandes from ending his association with the team. The Queens Park Rangers chief, who watched his side bounce back to the Premier League at Wembley on Saturday, is reportedly keen to sell up for a figure said to be in the region on £350million. Cashing in: QPR owner Tony Fernandes could sell his Caterham team for a fee of around £350m . Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg’s spat shouldn’t deter from the remarkable effort by their Mercedes team this season. Monaco’s race was their fifth straight 1-2 finish – a feat a Nigel Mansell-led Williams in 1992, and McLaren – in Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna in 1988 – were never able to achieve. Can Mercedes win every race? It’s never been done before, but you wouldn’t back against them.

"By . Jamie Redknapp . I could never understand why there was a debate about Ross Barkley. Of course he had to be in the World Cup squad – now can he force his way into the team? That is the challenge for Barkley, Raheem Sterling and Luke Shaw. I hope we get to see plenty of them in Brazil. Shaw may have to be patient behind Leighton Baines, but Barkley and Sterling have proven this season in the Barclays Premier League that they can be game-changers. Barkley has scored dazzling goals for his club, against Newcastle and then Manchester City, when the England manager was watching him. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Barkley and Sterling showing their skills in England training . Bamboozling: Ross Barkley can run with the ball with speed and that alarms opponents . The fast show: Raheem Sterling's lightning pace can frighten the life out of opposition defences . Dazzling: Ross Barkley has scores some superb goals for Everton, including this solo strike against Newcastle . Super strike: Sterling has weighed in with crucial goals this season, including this one against Norwich . Jamie Redknapp predicted his England squad earlier this month, and was just one out (but who was it?) He has been well managed by his Everton manager, Roberto Martinez, who has rested him at times. That is the sign of a manager putting the development of a young player first. At his best, he runs with the ball at speed, can break the lines and bamboozle defenders. There is no point in England going to the finals, playing meekly and not laying a glove on any opponents. So let’s pick players who can damage our group rivals and beyond. Defenders do not like to deal with pace and dare – and this squad has plenty of that. We saw how easy it was for Andrea Pirlo to pick off England and to play through them at the European Championship. The veteran Italian maestro is a magnificent holding midfielder, but will he be as comfortable if he has direct and explosive pace running at him? Patience is a virtue: Luke Shaw (left) may have to wait for his chance behind Leighton Baines at left back . England have players here who can move across the ground quickly with the ball. Not just Sterling and Barkley, but also Adam Lallana. He has enjoyed a brilliant season for his club and is now going on to the world stage. It is an exciting squad. There are similarities with the age profile of the squad for Euro 96, a squad that lifted the nation and included young players who operated without fear. That’s what I want from this group, too. When I named my predicted squad last week, it included 22 of the 23 Roy Hodgson named yesterday. My only change would have been Steven Caulker for Chris Smalling, who has had a poor season. Roy obviously knows him after working with him at Fulham, so he trusts him. Smalling can also cover at full back. There is enough experience there too, with Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard among the experienced names. And Wayne Rooney will find more space, if he has pace around him. Storming: Adam Lallana has had a superb season in which he made his England debut against Chile . The stand-by players have to be ready . too, because when did we last have a major tournament that wasn’t . interrupted by injury in the build-up? So they have to stay sharp, . focused and alert. My view . on sports psychology is mixed, but Steve Peters will also have a big . role to play, especially with the Liverpool players. They . were bouncing into the World Cup, but now they are limping after what . happened at the end of the season. Nobody more so than the captain, . Gerrard. They will need some help to get ready for the challenges ahead. I hope this squad can deliver a surprise in Brazil. Let’s see how far they can go.","Luke Shaw must be patient behind Leighton Baines .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . It was once a gritty stretch of Manhattan known for rail yards, warehouses and aging industrial buildings, so desolate it was dubbed 'The Wild, Wild West'. Now, one of the US's biggest construction projects is transforming a stretch of Manhattan's west side with 20 new buildings - 17 of them high-rises - so tightly packed that it has earned the nickname: 'Hong Kong on the Hudson.' When finished in 2024, the Hudson Yards area will boast more hotels, as well as an observation deck higher than the Empire State Building. Scroll down for video . New plans: An artist's rendering shows the planned Hudson Yards' development project . Photo of Hudson Yards shows parked Long Island Rail Road trains with ongoing construction nearby . In progress: Construction of skyscrapers is underway in New York . This is going to be the new heart of New York,' says Michael Samuelian, a project manager for the $20bn Hudson Yards - a joint venture of Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group. This development and the adjacent $4.5bn Manhattan West complex comprise the city's most ambitious private real estate ventures since Rockefeller Center went up in the 1930s. When fully completed, the two projects will offer more than 22 million square feet of space, including 6,000 residential units - more footage than the rebuilt World Trade Center in lower Manhattan. Construction on Manhattan West's first 65-storey office tower will start after the platform is finished by year's end. How it will look: The planned Manhattan West development project on the west side of Manhattan . Development project: A huge crane by rail tracks used by commuter trains at Penn Station in New York . The plan for Hudson Yards, occupying an area between 30th and 34th streets bordered by Tenth Avenue and the West Side Highway, features 16 buildings - 14 of them skyscrapers. The first, 52-storey tower rising over the rail yards is expected to open in 2015, anchored by the Coach luxury retailer with tenants including L'Oreal USA and German software giant SAP. Work also has begun on Hudson Yards' tallest building - an 80-storey skyscraper with an observation deck higher than the Empire State Building. It will be home to the corporate headquarters of Time Warner by 2019. The Hudson Yards project site shows ongoing construction of skyscrapers . Manhattan West fills the block between .

The 16-storey building is to undergo a $200m renovation with glass . floor-to-ceiling exteriors by 2016. New York University urban planner Mitchell Moss says the developments accelerate a shift of the city's high-end commercial heart away from the traditional stronghold of midtown Manhattan surrounding Rockefeller Center. Michael Samuelian, right, Hudson Yards project director for planning and architecture, tours the project site . 'They reflect New York's new economic . center of gravity, shifting to the west and south all the way down to . the World Trade Center,' Moss says.

"By . Louise Cheer . It was an intimate outback wedding for the happy couple's closest family and friends. But as Gemma Ludgate and John Hancock exchanged vows, there was one person noticeable by  her absence - the groom's mother Gina Rinehart. The mining magnate, Australia's richest person, had been locked in a bitter battle with her 38-year-old son and his siblings for control of the family's multi-billion dollar trust fund. John Hancock and his long-term partner, Gemma Ludgate, wedded in an intimate ceremony in Pilbara, Western Australia . The couple married on April 30 at Pibara, in Western Australia, the beautiful country setting  synonymous with the groom's late grandfather Lang Hancock, Sydney Private reported. They only invited 50 guests, including Mr Hancock's good friend Olympian Grant Hackett. The happy couple have been engaged for eight years and have two children together, aged seven and four. Photos of the wedding were published on Monday by Woman's Day after the newlyweds struck a deal with the magazine. 'My relationship with my mum is complex … but I thank her for helping me become the man I am today,' the Perth-based mining consultant and derivatives trader told the magazine. He said Ms Rinehart had influenced his choice of location for his 'Pilbara Adventure' wedding at Oxer Lookout in Hancock Gorge, 1,400 kilometres north-east of Perth. The groom said it was his grandfather's and mother's favourite spot, and wanted to share it with friends. The guests at the April wedding did not include Mr Hancock's mining magnate mother, Gina Rinehart . The only member of his immediate family who was present for the wedding was John's sister, Bianca, who joined in on the wedding part at the Karijini Eco Retreat in the Karijini National Park. It is not the first time Ms Rinehart was not included in her children's wedding celebrations. Last year Bianca wedded in Hawaii, without her mother's knowledge. Mr Hancock's other sisters, Ginia and Hope, were also absent from the wedding. The mining heiress and three of her children have been feuding over the trust fund since 2011. The trio have been trying to wrestle control of the fund, which they are all beneficiaries, from Ms Rinehart. Only one of her children, Ginia, sided with the matriarch. Despite multiple attempts to suppress details of the court action, it was revealed Ms Rinehart had pushed the release date of the funds to her children back by more than 50 years - which sparked the feud. It was estimated the fund was worth at least $2.4 billion in 2012 - when the children were due to become billionaires. Gina Rinehart (pictured right in 2013) has since stood down from her position as trustee of the multi-million-dollar fund . The fund was set up by Lang Hancock and controls almost a quarter of Hancock Prospecting Proprietary Limited. Ms Rinehart has since bowed out of her role as trustee and Hope has withdrawn from the court action. Mr Hancock and his sister, Bianca, continue to battle their mother in the New South Wales Supreme Court, alleging their mother had acted dishonestly in her role as trustee. A new trustee is yet to be appointed. The Ludgates relationship with the mining family has spanned generations. In the 1950s, Lang Hancock would take to the skies in a small, single-engine plane and fly 400km from his station, Mulga Downs, to the Ludgates' station just to use the landline to make overseas business calls as the coaxial cable ended there at that time. About 60 years later, Gemma Ludgate donned a white Aurelio Costarella gown and an impressive strand of borrowed pearls to wed Lang's grandson. Mr Hancock was less formal in a pair of khaki drill pants, an open collared white shirt and a pair of RM Williams boots. Guests dined on a banquet of lamb and pig on the spit on cane chairs under the stars. Proceeds from the deal with Woman's Day went to the Royal Flying Doctor Service - where Mr Hancock was named a board member earlier in the year. The Hancock-Ludgate wedding took place at Oxer Lookout in Hancock Gorge, 1400 kilometres north-east of Perth .","John Hancock weds his partner Gemma Ludgate in intimate ceremony .

"By . Alison Smith Squire . Thriving: Eliza Bellamy is now a healthy six-month-old despite doctors claiming she had died after eight months in the womb . At six months old, little Eliza Bellamy is the bonniest of babies. But her smile belies the trauma of her entry into the world and an ordeal that no parent should ever have to face. When her mother Ellen was eight months pregnant, two doctors announced that her baby had died in the womb and would be stillborn. The news left her ‘simply devastated’. And while carrying what she thought was a dead baby, she and her husband Chris then had to think about funeral arrangements. Not only that, but at one point Mr Bellamy feared his wife had died as well after he saw a crash team rush into the hospital theatre where she was giving birth. In fact, the team were on standby because – against the doctors’ expectations – Eliza had been born alive. Despite this joyous reversal of fortune, doctors then further upset Mrs Bellamy, 31, by blaming her ‘excess stomach weight’ for their misdiagnosis. Wexham Park Hospital in Berkshire has since apologised to the couple. The blunder occurred on a Sunday and at a time when the sonographer, an expert in doing ultrasounds, was not working. The couple, who are both teachers and have a four-year-old daughter, Ava, said their nightmare began in November when Mrs Bellamy was admitted to hospital with heavy bleeding at 35 weeks. Two doctors carried out scans to check the baby. ‘When doctors told us our baby wasn’t moving and there was no heartbeat, Chris and I were simply devastated,’ said Mrs Bellamy. ‘And when nursing staff asked us to call relatives to bring a shawl to wrap up our dead baby in, and began discussing funeral plans, it was traumatic. ‘Calling my mother, my brother and sister-in-law with that news was the worst thing we have ever had to do. They then had the job of telling other family and friends, including our daughter.’ Ellen Bellamy, 31, had been planning the funeral when she unexpectedly went into labour. But she was distraught when the medics said it was her 'excess stomach fat' that caused them to make the blunder . The couple, from Langley, Berkshire, were then forced to wait four hours preparing for the arrival of their stillborn baby until an operating theatre became free. Mrs Bellamy said: ‘I still wanted to be awake when she was born, and hold her in my arms, even if she wasn’t alive. So I opted for an epidural. 'However, four attempts failed. And as I was bleeding so much I had to sign a consent form for a general anaesthetic, which meant Chris had to leave and wait outside.’ Mr Bellamy recalled the moment he believed he had lost his wife. ‘Suddenly the alarm went off and I saw a crash team rushing into the theatre,’ he said. ‘In that moment my whole world imploded as I thought Ellen had also died.’ I only believed it was true when I was wheeled down to special care and saw her for myself . - Ellen Bellamy . However, unknown to him,  Eliza had been born alive weighing 5lb 2oz and the crash team had been called in case she needed to be resuscitated. Mr Bellamy added: ‘About five minutes after the alarm sounded a midwife said our little girl had been born alive and well. ‘I will never forget the feeling of sheer relief when I realised both Ellen and Eliza were fine. I couldn’t believe it when the midwife showed me to a little cot where Eliza lay kicking her legs.’ Mrs Bellamy said that when she came round from the anaesthetic and was told her baby had been born alive she could not take it in. ‘I only believed it was true when I was wheeled down to special care and saw her for myself,’ she said. Eliza spent six days in the special care unit while Mrs Bellamy had several blood transfusions. She added: ‘Worst, while the consultant was apologetic, when we discussed what had gone wrong, he said part of the reason he was unable to see the scan clearly was due to me having excess weight on my stomach. Special care: Eliza, here at one day old, was born alive and well weighing 5lb 2oz, shocking doctors . ‘I was shocked as I know of women much larger than me who’ve had normal pregnancies and been scanned efficiently. ‘And we believe we never would have suffered such a nightmare if a proper qualified sonographer had been on duty doing the scan.’ Eliza has no side effects, but her parents claim her survival was ‘through luck rather than judgment’ and are considering legal action. A spokesman for Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘We apologise unreservedly for the aspects of Mrs Bellamy’s care that fell below our usual standards. A serious incident was raised at the time and valuable lessons have been learned. ‘We understand this has been a traumatic and distressing time for Mrs Bellamy and her family and we will continue to work closely with her.’","Ellen Bellamy, 31, was 8 months pregnant when doctors delivered the news .

Less says she was inspired by a recent mother-daughter reunion, presumably referring to Katheryn Deprill, the 27-year-old Pennsylvania who posted a similar message on Facebook in hopes of tracking down her birth mother. Deprill's adoption story is slightly more memorable than most - she was referred to as the 'Burger King Baby' in local media accounts after her birth mother left the newborn Deprill wrapped in a shirt crying on the floor of a Burger King bathroom in 1986. Deprill began her quest March 2 by . posting on her Facebook page a photo in which she held up a sign that . said: 'Looking for my birth mother. ... She abandoned me in the Burger . King bathroom only hours old, Allentown PA. Please help me find her by . sharing my post.' The photo . was shared more than 30,000 times by Facebook users around the world, . and Deprill's story landed in numerous media outlets. Inspiration: Katheryn Deprill - dubbed 'Burger king Baby' in the media - was reunited with her birth mother after posting this on Facebook in March . That caught the . attention of the woman claiming to have abandoned her, and she came . forward to attorney John Waldron, who arranged for them to meet. Deprill said she bears a very strong resemblance to the woman, whose name she wouldn't disclose. 'It looked like I was looking in a mirror,' she said. Deprill, . an EMT and married mother of three who lives outside Allentown in South . Whitehall Township, said she embraced her mother. 'I . got the hug that I had wanted for the last 27 years, and that broke the . ice,' she said. 'I asked if I could have it, and she said, ""absolutely,"" and just held her arms open, and the rest is history.' The pair met for about four hours and exchanged contact information. Deprill said they plan to meet again. 'We are definitely going to have a relationship,' she said. Together: Deprill found her birth mother, Cathy Pochek, left, after launching an appeal on Facebook. Her adoptive mother, Brenda Hollis, is at right . Deprill inspired a man - also from Pennsylvania - to use social media to try and find his birth mother. David Volk . - who was left in a New Jersey McDonald's sink when he was just hours old - . launched a search for his birth mother after being inspired by the . success of the 'Burger King baby.' Volk, from Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania, didn't even try looking for his . mother because he had no information about her - but after Deprill posted an image on Facebook explaining that she'd been dumped in . a Burger King 27 years ago, it took her just three weeks to find her . mother. Inspired, Volk decided to do the same, and has now shared an image on his Facebook profile showing him holding a sign reading: 'Please help me! I am looking for my birth mother.' 'I just never thought there was any . hope,' he told the Star-Ledger. 'Being abandoned in a McDonald's, no records. After . seeing [Deprill's] story, and she found her mom so quickly, that's what gave me . the inspiration to do mine.' Hopeful: David Volk also has taken his search for his birth mother to social media, posting this image on Facebook in April . Volk . still had his umbilical cord attached when a manager found him wrapped . in a brown plastic bag in the sink of the women's restroom in a . McDonald's in Newark, New Jersey in December 1977. He . was given the name 'Christopher McDonald' because of where he was . found, but his name was legally changed when he was adopted a year . later, records show. Volk, . who is now 36 and married, said he developed a close bond with his . family and was devastated by the loss of his adoptive mother two years . ago. He said he isn't angry with his birth mother but simply wishes to meet her and get to know her. Volk's search is yet to turn up his birth mother. The night before she posted her photo on Facebook, Lees wrote a message to friends explaining how she was trying to find her birth mother. Anyone with information about Lees' birth mother is asked to contact her at kimsearch521@gmail.com . 'I will be posting a picture in the morning that I would be grateful if . you would share. I am adopted and have tried several avenues over the . last 10+ years to locate my birth mother and/or information leading to . her,' she wrote in her explanation. 'I was recently inspired by a story of a mother/daughter reunion . made possible via social media, so I figured it is worth a shot. Honestly, I myself gloss over many of these posted ""please share"" pictures, but I am hoping you all would take a minute to seek it out and . share. It is my birthday today, and this would truly be the best gift I . could receive. I hold no preconceived notions of how this will turn out- good, bad, or no response at all, I will take it as it comes. Thank you in advance!'","Kim Lees has been searching for her birth mother for more than 10 years .

"By . Hugo Gye . Brazil faces a new epidemic of child prostitution and sex tourism in the run-up to this summer's World Cup, politicians and activists have warned. Traffickers are reportedly recruiting young girls to work as prostitutes in the areas around the football stadiums in anticipation of a booming trade over the next few months. Up to half a million children as young as 11 are abused with the consent of their families, and pimped out to tourists or lorry drivers. The country's government has launched a new drive to remind visitors that child prostitution is illegal - but tourists are in fact rarely prosecuting for having sex with minors. Fears: The World Cup is set to bring an epidemic of child prostitution to the streets of Brazil (file photo) This week, a parliamentary commission found that child prostitution had soared in the areas around the Corinthians stadium in Sao Paulo, where the first game of the World Cup will take place on June 12. One 13-year-old girl told the inquiry that she had been abused by a construction worker at the stadium who impregnated her, according to The Times. 'After a while he said he would take me,' she said. 'My father did not care much. It seems that for him it was good, because it was one less mouth to feed.' Other young girls sell their bodies along one of Brazil's main highways, the BR-116, where truckers stop for sex while transporting goods on journeys which can last days. Industry: The government is trying to crack down on prostitution but with mixed success (file photo) Matt Roper, a British journalist, has set up a charity to help victims of trafficking on the road - many of whom are sold into prostitution by their own relatives. 'Mothers or family members have no problem taking their daughters to a roadside brothel,' he told The Times. 'It's just seen as completely normal.' The government is attempting to crack down on the practice, with child prostitution even featuring as a major storyline in a popular soap opera. 'Every tourist who arrives in Brazil will know that the exploitation of children and juveniles is a crime,' a spokesman said earlier this month. 'He'll see it in airplanes, airports, bus and train stations and hotels.' Threat: A report this week revealed that child prostitutes were common in the area around the Corinthians stadium in Sao Paulo, pictured . But charities are still worried that the World Cup will set the campaign backwards by increasing the number of potential customers for underage prostitutes. 'While the World Cup is a joyful time, it also exposes vulnerable young children and adolescents to violence and sexual exploitation,' said Anette Trompeter of Plan International. 'Unfortunately tourism is often linked with the sexual exploitation of children, due to an increasingly permissive atmosphere and the use of hotels at this time.' Adriana de Morais, an activist who patrols the bars of Natal - a north-eastern city which will host four World Cup games - trying to help child prostitutes is also concerned about the effect the competition will have. 'It's a singular event that brings many people from outside, and we really worry about sexual tourism,' she told AFP.","Brazil has up to half a million child prostitutes, according to activists .

"By . Snejana Farberov . At age 18, Kelly Rothe was faced with a terrifying prospect when a genetic test for a potentially deadly cancer gene came back positive. Rothe, who lost her mother to breast cancer 14 years ago, chose life, becoming one of the youngest women in Michigan to undergo a prophylactic double mastectomy. On May 10, the vivacious young woman flashed a smile and two thumbs up as she was wheeled out of Beaumont Hospital in Michigan a day after the long-awaited operation. Bold move: Kelly Rothe, 20, pictured left before her preventative double mastectomy and right two days after the surgery . Under the knife: Rothe, pictured with Detroit Wings player Jimmy Howard, went in for surgery at Beaumont Hospital earlier this month, two years after taking a genetic test . Since learning of the 'enemy within’ two years ago, Rothe has willingly become a poster girl for genetic testing, encouraging 20-somethings and even teenagers to be proactive about their health. Given her family history, for Rothe the decision to undergo a double mastectomy as a preventative measure was a no-brainer. Cancer has been a part of her life since age six when her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer.At age 38, Nancy Rothe lost her battle with the deadly disease. Her aunt, Janet, succumbed to the same illness a short time later. Kelly spent a part of her childhood in hospitals with her dying mother and for many years was certain that she too was destined to die from cancer. Then two years ago, the high school senior learned of an early detection test that can determine if a patient has the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations linked to higher risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers. Ms Rothe and two of her surviving aunts took the test. Three days after her 18th birthday, Kelly got the results, which turned out to be positive, Detroit Free Press reported. Living in fear: Kelly lost her mother and aunt to breast cancer, and she was certain as a child she she too will die from the same illness . The teenager cried and hugged a teddy bear given to her by her mother, she told Michigan Radio, but she expected this outcome all along. 'I went in to the testing thinking, “OK I’m positive and if I’m negative, that’s a nice surprise,”' she told Mlive.com. The other thought that kept nagging at Kelly was: if only genetic testing was available when her mother was still alive. Kelly Rothe was reassured by her doctor that she would not need surgery until age 30, but given her mother's young age at the time of her diagnosis, she was not going to sit around and wait for cancer to strike. She knew at once that she was going to have her breasts removed, and she was going to do it as soon as possible. Last July, she made an appointment with the surgeon who operated on her aunt. At first, he dismissed the idea of performing a bilateral mastectomy on a 20-year-old, but after talking to Ms Rothe about her family’s fraught medical history, the physician came around. The surgery performed earlier this month was fully covered by Kelly’s medical insurance. Afterwards, she told reporters she was feeling sore, but satisfied with the outcome. Moment of truth: Three days after her 18th birthday, Kelly learned that she carries the BRCA1 genetic mutation linked to 87 per cent chance of contracting breast cancer . Decisive: Doctors told the 20-year-old college junior she could wait until she turns 30 and has children to have the surgery, but Rothe convinced them she had no time to waste given her family history . Around the time of her 21st birthday this coming August, Kelly will be back in the hospital for breast reconstructive surgery. Rothe, a junior at Eastern Michigan University, is not planning to let her genes stop her in her tracks. She aspires to become a special education teacher, earn a Phd and have no fewer than four children. The 20-year-old Ann Arbor resident is marching in the footsteps of Hollywood star Angelina Jolie, who famously opted to have her breasts removed last year upon learning that gene mutations increased her risk of contracting breast cancer to 87 per cent. Star power: Oncologists have noticed that a growing number of young women have been undergoing double mastectomies since Angelina Jolie had the surgery last year . Doctors have noticed a sharp spike in double mastectomies after Jolie's highly publicized surgery, which has been a cause for concern in the medical community, especially when it comes to young women like Kelly Rothe. A recent study found more than two-thirds of women who had both breasts removed after a cancer diagnosis did not have a medical reason for doing so. The research showed that of 1,447 women treated for breast cancer, almost 8 per cent had undergone a double mastectomy. But 69 per cent of these women who underwent removal of the unaffected breast at the same time had no genetic or family risk factors. On her part, Kelly has made it clear that she does not encourage young girls, including her own 17-year-old sister, to rush to the nearest hospital to have a double mastectomy. The decision to go under the knife was all her own, and her father, Robert Rothe, supported his daughter's choice. . Rothe explained that she did not want to wait until she had kids, like her doctors had suggested, because she said she did not want them to have the kind of childhood she had, whiling away the hours in hospital rooms. ‘If you had a bomb strapped to your body, would you wait or would you try to dismantle it? That’s how I explain it, and it usually gets people on my side,’ she said. In her quest to spread the word about genetic testing, Rothe has been giving interviews and holding press conferences. She and her father also signed up to be in a new documentary called Pink and Blue about the BRCA mutation gene.","At age 18, Kelly Rothe found out from genetic test that she has BRCA gene mutation responsible for 87 per cent chance of contracting breast cancer .

"By . Brian Marjoribanks . Alex Neil's post-match summary was as cutting as his impressive team had been in destroying and relegating a fragile Hibs. After . watching his goalkeeper Kevin Cuthbert clinch promotion to the . Premiership by saving a tame penalty by teenager Jason Cummings, the . Hamilton Accies manager declared this famous and thrilling victory to be . a triumph of hope over fear. 'Over the two legs, we were . desperate to win and Hibs were terrified to lose,' said Neil. 'I can . understand (the fear factor) because I've been relegated with Hamilton . before but I just thought that was the difference between the two teams . over the two legs – we were determined to win the game while Hibs looked . terrified to lose.' Celebration: Hamilton Academical overturned beat Hibernian to win Scottish Premiership promotion . Promotion party: Hamilton rallied back from a 2-0 first leg deficit to beat Hibernian 4-3 on penalties . Late drama: Tony Andreu (left) scored an injury time goal for Hamilton to force extra time against Hibernian . Wild scenes: Hamilton players celebrate Andreu's goal in front of their supporters at Easter Road . Hibernian: Williams, Maybury, Nelson, McGivern, Stevenson, Robertson, Craig, Heffernan (Tudur Jones 83), Stanton, Cummings, Haynes (Harris 8),Harris (Thomson 68). Subs Not Used: Cairney, Collins, Murdoch, Forster. Hamilton: Cuthbert, Gordon, Canning, Garcia Tena, Mackinnon, Longridge (Antoine-Curier 67), Routledge (Neil 81), Gillespie, Crawford (Ryan 81), Scotland, Andreu. Subs Not Used: Devlin,Keatings,Currie,Kilday. Booked: Ryan. Goals: Scotland 13,Andreu 90. Agg (2-2) Hamilton win 4-3 on penalties. Attendance: 18,031 . Referee: William Collum (Scotland). Neil's assessment was spot on. From the moment Jason Scotland capitalised on some typically miserable Hibs defending to put Accies into the lead, nervous tension spread across Easter Road, infecting players and fans alike. It had been exactly the same when Kris Boyd scored against the run of play to consign Hibs to the play-offs in the first place. Yet, to focus solely on the deficiencies of Hibs would be to do Hamilton a major disservice. Neil's team were a credit to themselves and despite the sneers about their low following, from a footballing perspective on yesterday's evidence they will be a fine addition to the top flight. While Hibs were hopeless, and reliant on aimless hoofed balls forward, Neil's players admirably stuck to their passing principles. Even three minutes into injury time, and needing a goal to level the tie, they refused to panic and passed the ball up the park until Jason Scotland's cut back was swept home by Frenchman Tony Andreu.  From first to last they left absolutely everything out on that pitch. And after 120 stamina sapping minutes, each player who strode forward to take a pressurised spot kick – Grant Gillespie, Andreu, Mickael Antoine-Curier and Scotland – showed no sign of fatigue. On a day that the Edinburgh Marathon was also in town, it was a stunning feat of endurance by Hamilton, whose manager was one of the few not to fancy himself from the spot.  'When it went to penalties, I was thinking ""Please, five guys put up your hands because I don't want the pressure"",' Neil admitted. 'Thankfully we had six hands going up. Down and out: Hiberninan players look dejected during their play-off penalty shootout heartache . Lashed home: Jason Scotland (right) started Hamilton's comeback with a first-half goal against Hibernian . 'I  asked which ones were not quite sure but they were all sure they . would score. That was great for me. I wasn't taking the fifth one, no . chance. Being player and manager and fifth penalty taker would have been . too much for me. The goalie was on one before me.' Hibs had not won . at home since February 15 and it's largely due to the kind of defending . that saw them go behind yesterday. Ryan McGivern's slack ball out of . defence was sent forward by Ali Crawford to Andreu, who played in . Scotland. The Trinidad international striker spun the awful . Michael Nelson quite beautifully before smacking a ferocious low shot . goalwards from the edge of the box. The ball hit Ben Williams and . bounced up into the back of the net for Scotland's ninth goal of the . season. It was game on and rather appropriately the heavens above Leith . opened to spit their fury on the Hibs players. The biggest . reflection of the crisis of confidence in the home ranks came when Paul . Heffernan ran clear on goal, only to hit a shot that was so poor and so . lacking in power that it failed to go out for a throw in. Accies, . meanwhile, were zipping the ball confidently about the Easter Road turf . as if it were their own manor. As 17,000 Hibees held their breath, . at the other end it took a good save with his feet to stop Louis . Longridge making it 2-2 on aggregate. A good Alan Maybury block stopped . Longridge pulling the trigger minutes later after fine build-up work. 'Going down with the Jambos' came the prescient cry from Accies fans, sensing blood. Decisive strike: Jason Cummings missed penalty meant Hibernian's 15-year Scottish top flight stay is over . Saved: Kevin Thomson also saw his penalty stopped as Hibernian lost 4-3 in the shootout at Easter Road . Man of the moment: Hamilton goalkeeper Kevin Cuthbert saved two penalties in the play-off shootout . Hibs . were truly pitiful and by the half hour mark their fans were jeering . each misplaced pass, of which there were many. Their well-remunerated . players were being given the run around by Longridge, signed from junior . outfit Bo'ness United, and outfought by Darian MacKinnon, plucked from . non-league Clydebank. Cummings did have a header kicked off the . line by Routledge but it was Hibs' only threat all afternoon and Andreu . hit the side netting just before the break. In the second half, Williams . saved to stop Scotland levelling the tie on aggregate. As Accies . chased the second, McGivern could have seen red for fouling Scotland as . he burst through on goal. Accies boss Neil then sent on Antoine-Curier, . Andy Ryan and himself but in rain of almost biblical proportions, it . looked like Hibs had weathered the storm. Still, there was a strange . sense of inevitability when, with just 75 seconds remaining, Scotland . set up Andreu to take the tie into extra time. The final 30 minutes saw . two big and correct calls by referee Willie Collum, refusing to award . Hibs a penalty for a foul on Craig then booking Ryan for diving at the . other end 30 seconds later. Champagne moment: Hamilton players celebrate promotion to inside their dressing room . Grim viewing: Hibernian manager Tony Butcher was unable to prevent his side from blowing a 2-0 first leg lead . Frustration: Hibernian fans make their feelings known outside Easter Road after their relegation . And so to penalties. Up stepped Kevin . Thomson, whose poor kick was save. The former Rangers and Scotland star . had chosen the wrong day to declare in the newspapers that Hibs won't . find a better midfielder than him. With Accies scoring with ease, . the final kick fell to Cummings. He of the self-proclaimed left-foot . that could 'open a tin of beans' failed and Hibs were sent down. The . mood turned poisonous around Easter Road. For Accies, though, this was a famous and deserved victory. And for Neil, it was one he had foretold. 'I . think people in general had written us off but I always believed we . would win,' he smiled. 'I just had a feeling. I don't know what it was. I . was actually going to play myself from the start but then I got that . feeling and took myself out of the team again. 'I changed it about . and to a man we were unbelievable. The effort we put in was incredible. I'm pleased for the players. They've put in so much this season and I . felt we should have won the Championship. 'We didn't, Dundee did, and that was difficult to accept. 'But . I heard (English striker) Kevin Phillips saying recently the best way . to go up is through the playoffs.

Today, the four girls are celebrating with a party at their home in Rotherham, South Yorks. 'It’s . been an incredible first year,' 44-year-old Justin told The .

Miracle babies: Caroline, Darcy, Alexis and Elisha were born at 30 weeks after their mother was hospitalised . Little miracles: After nearly a decade of trying, Justin and Christine Clark had almost given up hope of becoming parents but their first round of IVF  proved successful and here they are today . Justin and Christine met in a pub 12 . years ago and married three years later. Like most young, married . couples, they longed to start a family. ‘I’d . always wanted to be a mum,’ Christine said at the time of the girl's . birth. ‘I don’t come from a big family, but children were always on the . agenda. We started trying before we got married, but nothing happened. ‘I was only 25, so I didn’t panic. But after two years we went to our GP who did lots of tests. It turned . out I had polycystic ovaries and would probably need help to get . pregnant. Supermarket sweep: Trips to the supermarket are more fun - and their local has custom-built a four-seater trolley for their weekly shop . Quite a handful: The babies were getting through 200 nappies and are all lactose intolerant . ‘It was very . upsetting. Friends were getting pregnant and while I was always happy . for them and never jealous, I would be thinking: “Why isn’t it happening . for us?”’ The couple tried several treatments, including the ovary-stimulating drug Clomid, but the side-effects made Christine ill. ‘IVF was really a last resort because we knew what a rollercoaster it could be,’ she says. ‘People . don’t understand unless they’ve done it, and we discussed whether we . wanted to put ourselves through it. It was our final hope.’ Justin and Christine were referred to Care Fertility in Sheffield, and were offered two rounds of IVF on the NHS. Celebrations: The foursome will be celebrating with presents at their home tomorrow . Each to their own: The quads are developing their own individual personalities as they grow older, say their parents . She finally fell pregnant and was admitted to hospital . for bed rest at 24 weeks and the twins were delivered by Caesarean . section at 30 weeks on March 25, weighing between 2lb and 3lb each. ‘We had more than 42 staff and took . up two surgical theatres,’ she says. ‘Everyone wanted a front-row seat. When the babies came out, they were whisked into a side room and Justin . went with them. ‘It was upsetting for me as I was desperate to see them, but I didn’t get anywhere near them for 24 hours. That was hard. ‘Justin . took 253 pictures of them to show me because I went straight to high . dependency. The babies had bruised my lungs because they’d been kicking . me so hard.’ Inseparable: The quads' parents say the four girls do everything together . Troublemakers: 'They get up to all sorts of stuff together and always seem to encourage each other. It¿s brilliant to watch,' said their father . Christine left . hospital a week later, but her daughters remained in special care for . nine more weeks until they came home at the end of May. A year later, the lorry driver and his nurse wife . Christine, 37, say that the girls are all coming into their own and are . gradually becoming self-sufficient. 'They . are always together,' said Justin. 'They get up to all sorts of stuff . together and always seem to encourage each other. It’s brilliant to . watch.' Unfortunately, all . four of the girls are lactose intolerant and allergic to dairy, soya and . glucose, which sets the family back £2,500-a-month.

"By . Louise Cheer . The beer made famous by television's favourite cartoon dad has been labelled 'dangerous' by doctors. Australian Medical Association president Steve Hambleton has warned plans by Woolworths to stock the new alcoholic beer, Duff, in their BWS and Dan Murphys stores from May 28 would increase 'the social acceptability of alcohol misuse'. 'People have been watching The Simpsons for years, this is ready-made product placement and dangerous exposure to people misusing alcohol,' he said. Duff Beer has been made into a easily recognisable brand by Homer Simpson who loves drinking it on The Simpsons . 'We’ve talked in the past about the effects of exposing young children to alcohol advertising, here it is in spades.' The Simpsons cartoon has been airing on Channel Ten for more than 20 years. But the supermarket giant has hit back at the claims. A Woolworths Liquor Group spokeswoman said The Simpsons would be left out of promotional materials for Duff and the group had followed alcohol advertising codes. Woolworths is planning to stock the iconic beer in its BWS and Dan Murphys stores . The brand of Duff Beer features heavily in The Simpsons, especially in the episode where the TV family go on a trip to the Duff Gardens amusement park where they encounter mascot, Surly . She also added there would be no press, outdoor or website advertisements for the beer. A pop-up bar dedicated to the beer's Australian landing is being held at Sydney's Woolloomooloo Bay Hotel for seven days and Duff also has its own Facebook page. But the spokeswoman stressed to the Canberra Times that 'all materials have adhered to alcohol advertising codes'. Dr Hambleton's comments come after repeated calls from the AMA to launch a parliamentary inquiry into alcohol advertising. AMA president Steve Hambleton says the introduction of Duff Beer will make heavy drinking more socially acceptable because of its association with the cartoon series . He said research showed underage drinking prevents young people from realising when they are drunk. It has been quite a trial for Duff beer to even make it to Australian shores. In the 1990s, brewers Lion Nathan were unsuccessful in trying to produce a version of the beer after the move was blocked by Twentieth Century Fox, who own the trademark to the brand, in the Federal Court in 1996. Perth's Allstates Liquor Wholesalers were handed a 'cease and desist' by Fox in 2011 after stocking a beer called 'Legendary Duff Beer' with a remarkably similar label and logo to the one depicted in The Simpsons. Woolloomooloo Bay Hotel is hosting a seven-day pop-up bar, debuting Duff Beer, which Woolworths says it is within the alcohol advertising guidelines .","Woolworths to start stocking the famous beer in BWS and Dan Murphys .

"By . Ryan Lipman . Hyundai is recalling every ix35 made in the past three years due to safety concerns. The vehicle is the most sold small SUV in Australia and the South Korean car manufacturer issued the recall for 32,525 vehicles built between Januaray 2011 and December 2013 because the airbag in the steering wheel may not be secured properly and also because the horn may not work. This is the second recall for the ix35 this year and part of a global recall totaling more than 137,500 Hyundai vehicles, as announced last week, reported The Advertiser. Hyundai is recalling every ix35 made in the past three years due to safety concerns relating to the airbag in the steering wheel and the horn . 'An incorrectly tightened bolt could result in the misalignment of the airbag module, possibly affecting its deployment, and could also affect the operation of the horn,' a Hyundai Australia statement about the safety issue reads. 'It will not cause the airbag to deploy unintentionally,' it continues. '(But) the effectiveness of the airbag could be reduced if the bolt is not tightened properly.' Despite this, the car marker said there have been no reported incidents in Australia but customers may notice a rattle in the steering wheel. Hyundai said during preliminary inspections only four vehicles have needed to have their airbag bolts tightened. A safety bulletin published on recalls.gov.au states Hyundai customers will be sent to letters requesting they return the vehicle to the nearest Hyundai dealership to have the driver’s airbag module bolts inspected and tensioned to specification free of charge. Hyundai has concerns the airbag in the steering wheel may not be secured properly . In April 2013, Hyundai recalled 227,000 cars so a faulty brake light switch that affected eight models could be fixed by dealers. The Hyundai ix35 recall is the 33rd this year, including ones from makers car makers Aston Martin. Hyundai recalled 6,193 ix35 SUVs in January because of a potentially faulty seatbelt pre-tensioner. In the car manufacturer's foundation years, Hyundai refused to recall vehicles despite the front suspension assembly of 46 Hyundai Excel cars collapsing while in use in 1998.

"By . Ryan Lipman . Mathilda Vazille, 13, is in a coma after being hit by a car and flung into wall in Sydney's northern beaches on Saturday . A teenage girl thrown metres into a brick wall after being hit by a car at a notorious accident hotspot in Sydney's northern beaches is in a coma. Mathilda Vazille, 13, was hit by a car while crossing Warringah Rd, Narraweena just after 7pm on Saturday - the same intersection where model Samantha Harris' fiancé hit and killed a 78-year-old grandfather while speeding. According to witnesses, the teenager was trying to cross at the intersection of Alfred St when she was hit by a vehicle, which was overtaking, reported The Daily Telegraph. Some residents including Kim Usai reported hearing a loud bang before running to help the young teenager  until paramedics arrived at the scene. Ms Usai rushed to scene where Mathilda was lying against the front wall of her house after hearing the accident. 'Everyone was around helping her so I gave her a blanket to keep her warm,' she said. Ms Usai said residents were accustomed to accidents at the notorious intersection. Shortly afterwards police and paramedics arrived and Mathilda was flown to Royal North Shore hospital in a ­critical condition. The corner of Alfred Street and Warringah Road, in Narraweena is considered an accident hotspot by residents and is the same intersection where model Samantha Harris' boyfriend Luke William Hunt smashed into a ­Hyandai Lantra, killing a 78-year-old man two years ago . On Saturday night she had surgery before being transferred to Sydney Children’s Hospital in Randwick on Sunday, where she remains in a coma. The driver of the vehicle was taken to hospital and underwent mandatory blood and alcohol tests. After news of the accident, emotional friends of Mathilda have said they are praying for her to recover and described her as caring and considerate. While making his way home from the movies on Saturday night, friend Sam Edgley heard about an accident in the neighbourhood and texted Mathilda in fear it was her who had been hit. Pray for Matilda: Friends are rallying behind the young teenager and hoping for a speedy recovery . 'We were all worried because we knew Mathilda was in Narraweena but we thought these things are on the news all the time, it won’t be her,' he said. 'I sent a text to her and she didn't reply and then I started worrying. I'm still in shock, I don't really want to believe it.' On Sunday, school friends have used to Facebook ­to asking the community to pray for Mathilda. Others posted they were hoping for a speedy recovery. The accident happened at the same notorious intersection where model Samantha Harris' boyfriend Luke William Hunt smashed into a ­Hyundai Lantra two years ago, which killed a 78-year-old man. Investigations into Saturday's accident are ongoing and police ask anyone with information about the crash on Saturday to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

"By . Jennifer Newton . Angelina Jolie lookalike Luminita Perijoc has been arrested again after flipping out when taxi drivers refused to take her . An Angelina Jolie lookalike who was given a suspended sentence after forcing a taxi driver to have sex with her at knifepoint has been arrested again for disturbing the peace when she couldn't get a cab. Luminita Perijoc was given a suspended four year jail term last month when she dragged taxi driver, Nicolae Stan into her house and forced him to have intercourse and perform oral sex during the incident in 2012 in Romania. In this latest incident, Perijoc was at a four-star hotel in the town of Tulcea near the seaside Black Sea resort when she attempted to call a taxi. But the first driver that arrived spotted the 32-year-old, who models herself on the Hollywood actress, is said to have put his foot down and sped off. The hotel apologised and called her a second cab, which also drove off, after the driver said if he took the passenger, his wife would divorce him. The taxi company then said they had no drivers free to take her. But the news failed to impress Perijoc, who was supposed to be going to meet her mother in the nearby village of Cataloi. A staff member at the hotel, who declined to be named, said she shouted: 'These guys are all idiots, do they think I am going to jump on every taxi driver I meet?' Then fearing that the enraged woman was about to attack them, the hotel staff called police, who said she now faces a charge of disturbing the peace. During her first trial, the court heard that Perijoc suffered from a bad temper and struggled sometimes to control her anger, which even her family admitted was sometimes a problem. The 32-year-old, left, is said to model herself on the Tomb Raider star and Hollywood actress, right . The terrified cab driver locked himself in the bathroom during the 2012 incident and used his mobile telephone to call police to rescue him. The court had initially jailed her, but converted it to a suspended sentence on appeal after hearing that she had taken medication that had meant that she lost control on the night of the attack. Because of her resemblance to Angelina Jolie, the story not only made international headlines, but it also made her a household name in Romania. Friends told local media that Perijoc has now taken up professional boxing in a bit to get rid of some of her excess energy.","Luminita Perijoc was attempting to call a taxi from a Black Sea resort .

"By . Australian Associated Press . Prime Minister Tony Abbott's family has copped a fair amount of criticism this week but Labor has angrily denied suggestions that Opposition Leader Bill Shorten had anything to do with orchestrating the attacks. On Wednesday, the PM's daughter Frances, 22, was slammed for accepting a scholarship for a university degree costing more than $60,000 from a long-time friend of the Prime Minister. On Friday, his eldest daughter, Louise, came under fire for working at Australia's embassy in Geneva as it was revealed the office is headed by former Coalition staffer Peter Woolcott. And on Saturday, the former 'First Bloke' of Australia Tim Mathieson hit out at the PM's wife Margie Abbott, claiming she isn't doing enough charity work. Attacked: Louise Abbott (left), Margie Abbott (second right) and Frances Abbott (right) were all criticised this week . The Prime Minister accused some media outlets for 'dirt digging', but one of his senior government ministers has now blamed federal Labor leader Bill Shorten for orchestrating the 'repugnant' attacks. Health Minister Peter Dutton accused Mr Shorten of withdrawing from the media at the same time his office 'quite deliberately' launched these attacks against the Abbott family. 'I believe very strongly that this is an orchestrated attack by Bill Shorten and it needs to stop,' Mr Dutton told Network Ten on Sunday. Mr Shorten's office has rejected the allegations, calling them 'wrong, hurtful and completely without foundation'. Hurt: Opposition leader Bill Shorten has denied he had anything to do with the attacks on the PM's family . First Lady Margie Abbott (left) and her daughter Frances (right) have both come under fire . 'Bill has made his position very clear that families should not be dragged into the political debate,' a spokesman for Mr Shorten told AAP in a statement. 'This shows the government will stoop to any low it can to distract from its budget failure.' AAP understands the prime minister's office was contacted by Mr Shorten on Wednesday when questions started being asked about a $60,000 scholarship awarded to Mr Abbott's youngest daughter Frances. It's understood Mr Shorten told the office Labor was not behind the story and believed families should be kept off limits. Julia Gillard's partner Tim Mathieson claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott's wife Margie isn't doing enough for charity . A subsequent story carried complaints about the appointment of Mr Abbott's eldest daughter Louise to a government job in Geneva. Yet another story published on Sunday aired criticisms from Julia Gillard's partner Tim Mathieson about Margie Abbott's commitment to charity. A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister declined to comment on Mr Dutton's allegations, saying the stories about the Abbott family were of a personal nature and a distraction from the budget.

"By . Sarah Dean . Passionate anti-vaccination campaigner Meryl Dorey has received a terrifying death threat, hours before she appeared at a health convention on the Sunshine Coast this weekend. The lobbyist's controversial appearance at the Healthy Lifestyle Expo in Caloundra, Queensland, led to security being ramped up at the normally calm event. Ms Dorey, who campaigns against immunising children, told police she had received a threatening warning on her Facebook page which read: 'Really ur gunn be dead soon b**ch'. Death threat: Meryl Dorey, seen her during an appearance on Lateline, has received a threat, hours before she appeared at a health convention on the Sunshine Coast this weekend . The person who left the comment did not hide their name and police say a charge could be brought against them. Ms Dorey, who has no scientific or medical qualifications and previously claimed: 'I am not a doctor, but I have a brain', still attended the convention despite the threat to her life. Her talk on Sunday was titled: 'Vaccinations: Do they really save lives?' She told The Courier Mail she was the victim of 'medical discrimination'. 'It's always scary when people say they want you dead, you just never know who's actually going to act on that and who's behind the keyboard,' she said. Campaigner: Ms Dorey's talk on Sunday was titled: 'Vaccinations: Do they really save lives?' Controversial: The lobbyist appeared at the Healthy Lifestyle Expo in Caloundra on the Sunshine Coast on Sunday . She also called for laws to be put in place to protect her medical beliefs, arguing we already have 'laws against racial vilification, sexual vilification'. In December 2012, the New South Wales Department of Fair Trading ordered the Australian Vaccination Network (AVN)- which Ms Dorey was then president of - to change its name or risk being shut down. The move followed 'numerous' complaints from both the public and the Australian Medical Association that the AVN name was misleading the public and wasn’t an accurate representation of its activities. The AVN claims to be pro-choice and a 'vaccine safety watchdog' However, t-shirts on the group's website seemed to promote more fierce objectives which rule out vaccinating children at all. One top featured the slogan: 'Love Them, Protect Them, Never Inject Them'. The campaign group is now called the Australian Vaccination-Skeptics Network but still uses the same initials, AVN. Ms Dorey got involved with the group after her eldest son was allegedly adversely affected by DPT and MMR vaccines administered when he was a child. She is now the Public Officer and spokesperson for AVN. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Meryl Dorey found the message on her Facebook page .

"By . Sarah Dean . Usually after committing a crime the perpetrator attempts to scarper. But one man has reportedly begged cops to arrest him after he punched a pedicab driver and tried to steal the vehicle. The drunken 35-year-old also allegedly urinated in a Darwin city alley during his bizarre Friday night antics. Hijacked: A drunken man stole pedicab in Darwin at around 4.30am on Saturday morning and demanded police arrest him . Police say the man was from Larrakeyah an inner suburb of Darwin, the capital city of Australia's Northern Territory. He had reportedly just left Monsoons nightclub with a friend when he hailed the pedicab. They were standing outside the popular club on Mitchell Street at about 4.40am. 'A short way into the journey he demanded the driver stop so he could get out and urinate on the street,' Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen told the Northern Territory News. The man had just come out of Monsoons nightclub before he committed the bizarre crime . The drunken 35-year-old also allegedly urinated in a Darwin city alley . 'While he was relieving himself he began to argue with and abuse the driver.' The intoxicated punter then allegedly swung a punch at the bewildered driver. In his mission to take control of the pedicab, he pushed over the driver and jumped into his seat. He only made it to nearby Austin Lane in his unlikely getaway vehicle before a passing police patrol was flagged down to stop him. Supt Jorgensen said the pedicab thief 'demanded they arrest him'. He was in police custody on Saturday and is now facing charges of assault, disorderly and offensive behaviour.

A New Zealand woman is still coming to terms with the horrifying moment she was forced to hide in fear of her life from gunman Elliot Rodger, who killed six people in California on Friday night in a rampage just 100 metres from her home. Amelia Lyons, originally from Napier but based in Santa Barbara, said she got home from work at about 9.30pm and was walking home from a shop when a police officer with his gun out shouted 'get inside, take cover, there's a shooter', reported Stuff.co.nz. 'Obviously hearing that was very freaky,' she said and added as she ran home people on the street were shouting 'get inside'. Ms Lyons and her boyfriend ran into their house and hid for about 10 minutes while Rodge went on shooting spree. With police flocking to the area, Ms Lyons said the situation seem a little safer at that time. 'They (the police) were kind of running around... with huge semiautomatic rifles with them, handguns - very kind of foreign scenes to someone from New Zealand obviously where that just kind of does not happen,' she said. Ms Lyons added that the shooting had sent shockwaves through the town Isla Vista, where the attacks took place. Scroll down for video .

On waking to news that six people had been killed, Ms Lyons said it was 'bewildering' and that Rodger had got about 100 metres from her house. As the town comes to grips with the shocking tragedy, Ms Lyons said the mood was particularly 'sombre' as the normally upbeat town had been left hurting. 'The only topic of conversation obviously is last night - people calling their parents and reassuring them that they're OK... and people are starting to go to the sites of where stuff happened to... let it sink in that it actually did happen hear and to pay their respects,' she said.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Britain’s biggest energy suppliers have been criticised for keeping customer service callers on hold while answering calls to sales departments far quicker. Researchers for consumer watchdogs Which? found that phone callers to customer services were kept waiting up to 11 minutes at the same time as sales calls were answered within 90 seconds. The countrywide survey found that calling customer service at energy suppliers can be a frustratingly time-consuming chore yet sales callers are much less likely to be kept waiting for a reply. Of 16 energy companies, 11 answered their sales lines faster than customer service phones on average . Which? reported: 'Need to ring your . energy provider?

"By . Ryan Lipman . Drivers on most Australian roads would be accustomed to seeing My Family stickers plastered on the back of car windscreens. But the Gold Coast entrepreneurs behind the wildly popular trend have come under fire with claims the stickers could make those who choose to display them vulnerable to theft. U.S. police have issued a warning that the stickers could reveal useful details to criminals and therefore be making drivers targets, reported The Gold Coast Bulletin. Backlash: The creators of My Family stickers, Monica Liebenow and husband Phil Barham, pictured, have defended their product after U.S. police issued a safety warning about revealing private information . Creator Monica Liebenow of Gold Coast suburb of Burleigh, has rubbished the warnings. 'They are harmless stickers and they are put on cars with a great intention by people who want to express their family pride,' she said. 'I really don't think that is how any would-be robber is going to figure out their next victim,' she said. 'I’m sure they would have more sophisticated ways of doing that.' Ms Liebenow and her husband Phil Barham started the company in 2009 and the mother-of-four said the ongoing success of the stickers proved they posed no dangers. Urging critics to lighten up in their stance, Ms Liebenow said the stickers were a fun gesture that allowed people to express their family pride and some of their hobbies. The range has been a huge success and Ms Ms Liebenow said the continued popularity was proof the stickers did not pose any danger . For those concerned about any possible threat the stickers may pose, the entrepreneur's advice is simple. 'If you're worried about it, don't put it on your car (and) if we're going to make assumptions about things, why can’t we just assume the best,' she said. Ms Liebenow also added that the stickers were never intended to be taken seriously. Bond University criminologist and former police officer Terry Goldsworthy said the stickers were similar to sharing information on social media and that there was some risk to sharing private information publicly. Mr Golsworthy said there was always the possibility that someone could use the for ulterior motives. He gave the example of a young attractive girl being seen getting into a car with a sticker of her and a dog. In the absence of a male sticker, it could be assumed there is no man in her life, making her a target for someone to follow. 'Then they know your family structure, your car and where you live so while by themselves the stickers may not be of importance, together it can all add up,' he said.","U.S. police have issued warnings that My Family stickers could be dangerous .

"By . Belinda Robinson . Mugger: Mona Haj Youssef, 24,  laughed in the dock at her sentence for mugging the widow of murdered church organist Alan Greaves . A callous young woman who heartlessly mugged the brave widow of murdered church organist Alan Greaves - who died two years ago on Christmas Eve - burst out laughing in the dock as she avoided jail. Mona Haj Youssef, 24, launched a terrifying attack on Maureen Greaves, 64, punching her in the face just two days before the widow had to face the ordeal of the start of her husband Alan Greave's murder trial. In the shocking Christmas Eve murder, Mr Greaves, 68, was brutally beaten over the head with a hammer just minutes after he left his home in Sheffield on his way to play the organ at Midnight Mass at St Saviour's Church in 2012. The former social worker suffered severe head injuries when he was attacked by two men with a pickaxe handle and a hammer in the unprovoked attack. He died three days later. The devoted family man had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time when he bumped into Jonathan Bowling, 22, and Ashley Foster, 22, who were out looking for a random target. Mr Greaves, a grandfather and father of . four, was found by a delivery driver a short time later with . ‘catastrophic’ head injuries. Jonathan Bowling admitted to Mr Greave's murder and was jailed for life with a minimum of 25 years. Meanwhile, accomplice Ashley Foster was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nine years behind bars for the motiveless attack which provoked shock and outrage across the UK. But in a cruel twist of fate just days before Foster’s trial was due to start, his kind-hearted widow Mrs Greaves was attacked outside shops by Youssef leaving her shaken, bruised and with a cut cheek. Youssef, a former university student whose studies fell apart because she became hooked on drugs was given a two-year probation supervision order, 12 months’ mental health treatment and ordered to pay £250 in compensation for the assault. In happier times: Maureen Greaves is pictured with her late husband Alan Greaves . Loss: Mrs Greaves has already had to come to terms with the murder of her husband Alan Greaves . But when she realised she had avoided jail, Youssef laughed and shouted: 'Yeah, £250.' However, Mrs Greaves told how she was happy with the outcome. She said she hoped the former drug user would get the help she needed, adding: 'I am pleased this went to court because it means she will get some help. 'Not only did she hit me, she was extremely angry. I’m glad she is going to be supervised by the probation service and get some treatment for her mental health problems. Hopefully she will be able to be in society afterwards and not harm people. 'It’s for her own good as well as everybody else’s.'

Comfort: Maureen Greaves (left),  is comforted after she attended a church service at St Saviour in High Green, Sheffield for her husband in 2012 . Shortly after Mrs Greaves was mugged she said: 'It was very frightening. The worst thing was it made me imagine Alan being attacked and what he was feeling.' Youseef, of Sheffield punched Maureen in the face on June 22 last year. At her trial at Sheffield Crown Court, Martin Ward, prosecuting, said Youssef grabbed Mrs Greaves handbag and swore at her before striking her. 'She swung towards her, hit her across the face, and knocked her glasses off,' he said. Mrs Greaves dropped to the ground to try to find her glasses, but Youssef continued to hit her. The attack stopped when Maureen’s son Peter, who was walking ahead, realised what was happening and ran to help. Youssef was found guilty in her absence at an earlier hearing of assault by beating. Lucy Hogarth, defending, said Youssef had mental health problems which stem from drug abuse, but described her current mental condition as ‘stable’. The chairman of the bench told her: 'You started off life as an intelligent young woman at university - this is where drugs get you.' In a statement read to the court, Mrs Greaves said: 'It brought about a deep sadness and fear which I have never felt before.' Youssef was also sentenced for stealing £151 worth of items from Tesco in a separate incident.","Mona Haj Youssef, 24, mugged Maureen Greaves two days before her husband's murder trial was due to start .

The man, 36, was holidaying with a friend at the exclusive Outrigger on the Lagoon resort in Fiji's Viti Levu island. Police began searching the shoreline after they were alerted that he never returned from his lone snorkelling venture. An Australian man, 36, was found dead by locals early Sunday morning after he went snorkelling by himself off Fiji's coral coast on Saturday afternoon. He was staying at the exclusive Outrigger on the Lagoon resort with a friend . The resort's general manager, Peter Hopgood, said the man had checked in with a friend for just one night. He said the guest had gone snorkelling by himself about 3.20pm on Saturday and later returned to the beach. He was last seen walking along the sand at 5.45pm but was snorkelling late in the evening, according to Mr Hopgood. The man was reported missing when he hadn't returned his snorkelling gear and his belongings were found on the beach. Police were alerted at about 7.45pm and searched for the man late into the night. It resumed early Sunday morning and a neighbouring village of Fijians found the man's body washed up on a coral reef, about one kilometre south from the resort, on Sunday at about 9.50am. The lone snorkeller was reported missing when he never returned to his five-star accommodation on Saturday night . The body has been taken to a morgue at nearby Sigatoka for an autopsy. Mr Hopgood released a letter to the other guests at the luxury five-star holiday refuge, which said the resort was working closely with local authorities while the Australian High Commission was in the process of contacting the dead man's family. 'The resort has made the necessary arrangements with local authorities and the Australian embassy to return the body to Australia,' it said. 'The resort's family passes on our deepest condolences to the friends and family of the deceased. 'We request that guests refrain from entering the ocean after dark.' Australian authorities had little to add. 'The department is providing consular assistance to the family of a 36 year old Australian man who died in Fiji,' a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said. It's believed the man was originally from Perth but was residing in Melbourne. The Outrigger, popular among Australians, is about 80 kilometres from Nadi. The tragedy follows of the death of a Sydney father-of-three, Mark Hardaker, after a collision between two boats while holidaying with his family in Fiji on May 15.

"By . Emily Crane . Geoffrey Edelsten has admitted to blowing $63 million in less than two years on his lavish lifestyle and 'stupid' investments. The disgraced businessman, who claimed he only had $90 in cash when he filed for bankruptcy in the US in January, said he had to borrow money from his mother to fund his high living lifestyle. The 71-year-old's expensive taste was questioned in a US court on Friday as he fights to retain control of his estate. Geoffrey Edelsten, pictured here with ex-wife Brynne, admitted to blowing $63 million in less than two years on his lavish lifestyle and 'stupid' investments . Mr Edelston admitted to owning '20 to 25' cars in 2012 and spending 'extraordinary' amounts on clothing for his ex-wife Brynne Edelsten in Las Vegas, Fairfax Media reports. It was in Las Vegas that Mr Edelsten said he met his now estranged US business partners, the Mawardi family, and invested more than $22 million on fashion, apartment complexes and a casino in the Dominican Republic. The former doctor said it wasn't long before he 'squandered' all of the $28 million he received after selling four medical centres in 2011. The 71-year-old surprised his then wife Brynne Edelsten with this Aston Martin in April 2013 . When questioned about how he was funding his lavish lifestyle despite claiming he only had $90, he said 'I borrowed funds from my mother'. The Mawardi family, who fell out with Mr Edelsten in mid-2012, asked a judge on Friday to appoint an independent trustee to Mr Edelsten's estate following claims he has made a 'farce' of the bankruptcy proceedings. Fairfax Media reports that Mr Edelsten failed to disclose to the court the extent of his ownership of a number of luxury cars worth at least $3 million. The 71-year-old said he spent 'extraordinary' amounts on clothing for his former flame Brynne in Las Vegas . In February, Mr Edelston said he had five cars including an Aston Martin, Lamborghini and a Range Rover. But financial records indicate he also has an interest in two Ferraris, a 1930 Packard roadster and a Mercedes Benz CL65 because the cars are mortgaged to a company run by his friend and accountant Lindsay Hosking. Mr Edelsten would not comment on his financial affairs. He recently started dating Gabi Grecko, a 24-year-old model and DJ, after ending his four-year marriage to Brynne in January. Mr Edelsten spent millions on a Dominican Republic resort and casinso, Playa Chiquita, which he planned to turn into a nightclub . He also invested in low-rent apartment complexes including this block in Dayton, Ohio .","Geoffrey Edelsten filed for bankruptcy in January claiming to have only $90 .

"By . Alan Roden . An independent Scotland could open its doors to a huge influx of immigrants who would fill a city the size of Edinburgh, Treasury chiefs have claimed. The UK Government’s most detailed report to date on the seismic impact of a Yes vote will be published next week, which includes an in-depth analysis of demographic changes. A separate Scotland’s weaker fiscal position would mean a rapidly ageing population would have to be countered by a massive rise in foreign workers – a policy endorsed by the SNP. Strategy: Alex Salmond wants to lift restrictions on non-EU immigration if he wins the referendum . Over the 20 years from the first year of independence in 2016, Whitehall chiefs have calculated that net migration – the difference between those leaving and those arriving on these shores – would have to increase at an annual rate of 24,000. By 2035-36, that would take the total to an eye-watering 480,000 – a near  9 per cent rise on Scotland’s current population, placing unprecedented strain on health services and housing. The alternative would be to increase taxes or slash public spending to ensure the government could afford services for the growing number of elderly pensioners. Next week’s paper – set to be launched in Scotland by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander – is being billed as one of the most extensive financial analyses since the last Labour Government examined, and rejected, joining the euro. Top civil servants using independently-verified modelling have been working on the project for months, and aim to produce a definitive figure of the ‘Union dividend’ for every Scots family. Their five main findings are: . Scotland’s OAP population will rise from 1.04million in 2010 to 1.49million in 2066. But the working age population is only expected to increase from 3.3million to 3.6million. That will create a ‘dependency ratio’ of 2.41 workers for every pensioner, compared to 2.64 in other parts of the UK. Analysis: Danny Alexander . Alex Salmond’s proposed solution is to lift restrictions on non-EU immigration if he wins the referendum, bringing in more workers from abroad. But despite repeated requests for precise estimates, the Scottish Government has so far failed to produce detailed information. A senior Treasury source said next week’s paper has modelled a ‘high migration’ scenario, which could reduce the dependency ratio to the same as the UK’s if there is not a similar influx south of the Border. ‘To get the demographics simply to match the UK, Scotland would have to go up to the “high migration scenario”, which is 24,000 people a year net, so that’s more than tripling in migration relative to Scotland within the UK,’ the source said. ‘Over the 20-year period that we looked at that would basically be the equivalent of adding the population of Edinburgh to the Scottish population.’ Alex Johnstone, Scottish Tory spokesman for transport, infrastructure and  climate change, said: ‘Migrant workers play a vital role in Scotland’s economy, and many of our successful businesses would not be able to cope without them. ‘But under the SNP’s hare-brained separation plans, we would need an open-door approach just to have a fighting chance of balancing the books. That would require a different immigration policy to the rest of the UK, which would without question mean border controls were an absolute necessity. ‘Not only would that be divisive and inconvenient, it would harm the Scottish economy, which is why breaking up Britain is such a bad idea.’ Scottish Labour’s pensions spokesman Gregg McClymont added: ‘Pooling and sharing our resources across the whole of the UK means pensions are more affordable in Scotland. Only separation puts the pensions of Scots at risk.’ He added: ‘Alex Salmond needs to come clean about how much extra immigration would be needed to pay for pensions in a separate Scotland.’ A record 248,000 immigrants are already living in Scotland after an influx of migrants from Eastern Europe. The total number of people living in Scotland, but born outside the UK, now stands at 7 per cent of the population. But Mr Salmond plans to go far beyond official projections that Scotland will be home to 9,000 more foreigners every year by relaxing rules on minimum salary levels for entry. A spokesman for Finance Secretary John Swinney said: ‘Scotland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, more prosperous per head than the UK, France and Japan – but we need the powers of independence to ensure that wealth properly benefits everyone in our society. ‘On immigration, net migration to Scotland is already more than 10,000 a year, and independence will allow us to have a flexible policy to suit our economic needs.’ He added: ‘It is deeply revealing, but not surprising, that the Treasury’s main attack on independence plays the immigration card, as the Westminster establishment panders to a Ukip agenda.’","24,000 extra migrants a year needed in independent Scotland - Whitehall .

According to a new survey, those are the names most often given to women who pick their men for the size of their bank balance rather than for love. Other names that indicate a preference for money rather than romance include Lisa, Ashley, Amanda and Melissa.

Stephanie . 9. Nicole . 10. Angela . Rounding out the top 10 gold-digger names list, which was compiled by website DirtSearch.org, are Stephanie, Nicole and Angela. Dirt Search is an American website that lets users check potential partners for evidence of a criminal past or bizarre behaviour courtesy of its database of police records. The data behind the website's choice of names is the result of more than two million background checks, which found women bearing those names are the most likely to be involved in petty crime. Illegal ways of making money favoured by the world's Ashleys, Lisas and Jennifers include petty theft, property crime and vandalism. But it's not just the ladies who have been on the receiving end of a less-than-flattering background check at the hands of the brains behind Dirt Search. According to the website, men named Michael, David, John and Robert are the most likely to have been caught committing petty crime, while the US state of Arizona was found to have the highest number of people interested in checking their new partner's background. Exception: Nicole Scherzinger is with Lewis Hamilton for love but not every Nicole chooses the same . Suspect: Women named Lisa or Amanda are also potential gold diggers according to dirtsearch.org . For those who do happen to be dating a Jessica or a Jennifer, the site has this advice. 'Look out for a sense of entitlement and check whether they have trouble paying their bills. 'Gold diggers . drop hints that they may be evicted or their car might be repossessed . when instead they are buying $400 shoes and watches.' Other warning signs, say the brains behind the site, include being more than 15 years younger, never paying for anything and having a penchant for expensive things.","Women named Jennifer were most likely to prefer cash to love .

"By . Emma Innes . It has become the latest area of nutrition to be maligned. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley . and rye, has been linked with bloating, nausea, stomach cramps and fatigue and abandoned by A-listers such as Gwyneth Paltrow. But new research suggests it may have been unfairly condemned - with 'healthy' foods such as fruit, pulses and even common sweeteners to blame for bloating. Unfairly maligned: Foods containing gluten might not be responsible for symptoms such as bloating and stomach cramps . Professor Peter Gibson, from Monash University and the Alfred Hospital, in Melbourne, was one of the first who suggested that gluten sensitivity could be behind bloating, . But now he believes these symptoms are actually caused by short-chain carbohydrates called FODMAPs - also found in many products that contain gluten, Business Insider reports. These carbohydrates are fermented in the bowel which means fluid is drawn in and gas is produced. This results in symptoms such as flatulence, bloating and an upset stomach. Professor . Gibson told the publication: ‘The issue is that wheat has not only . gluten, but also FODMAPs, and we have found that FODMAPs are a very . important source that stimulates gut symptoms in people with irritable . bowel syndrome. ‘Where gluten was being blamed, the FODMAPs were probably the more important cause.’ Dr Peter Irving, a gastroenterologist at . Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital and The London Clinic, supports this . theory and says a 'Low FODMAP' diet can be very beneficial for people . with IBS. Experts say FODMAPs, not gluten, could be responsible for symptoms such as bloating and stomach cramps. Image shows which foods are rich in FODMAPs and should be avoided by people with irritable bowel syndrome . He says it restricts foods containing poorly absorbed sugars. 'It works on the principle that not all sugars can be absorbed within the small intestine,' he said. 'As a result, they are rapidly fermented by bacteria in the bowel which draws in fluid and produces gas. 'This can cause symptoms including bloating, abdominal pain and diarrhoea.' Foods . containing FODMAPs include honey, apples, pears, stone fruit such as . peaches, onions, garlic, cabbage, beans and sweeteners such as sorbitol. Foods . high in FODMAPs also include milk, ice cream, yoghurt, broccoli, . Brussels sprouts, pasta, biscuits, watermelon, lentils, baked beans and . chickpeas. Research at King's College Hospital found that 75 per cent of those on the diet saw their symptoms improve. Experts say some foods high in FODMAPs are not absorbed easily meaning they ferment in the bowel causing water to be drawn in and gas to be produced. They say it is this that causes symptoms. Image shows some foods that are low in FODMAPs . Professor Gibson studied the effect of FODMAPs by looking at 37 people who believed they were sensitive to gluten. These people were given all of their meals by the researchers and took stool samples while swapping between high-gluten, low-gluten and gluten-free diets. The volunteers did not know which diet they were on at any one time but the researchers found they experienced the same symptoms regardless. As a result, Professor Gibson concluded that gluten was not causing their symptoms and hypothesised that they would be more likely to see benefits from giving up FODMAPs. He says the only people who should give up gluten are those who have been diagnosed with coeliac disease.","Expert says it is not gluten but FODMAPs that cause bloating and cramps .

"By . Joel Christie . Rescue crews resumed their search Monday for the body of a four-year-old boy who went missing Saturday afternoon in Florida after falling out of his grandfather's boat. Officials said Logan Torrance Fontana disappeared while returning home from a fishing trip near Fort Pickens in Pensacola Bay. Logan's grandfather, Steve Maye, had dusted sand off his grandson's life and handed it back to him, saying to put it on, according to Fox 10 News. Maye then went to the front of the 19-foot fishing boat, which he was piloting, and picked up speed. Presumed dead: Logan Fontana, 4, fell from his grandfather's boat in Pensacola Bay on Saturday afternoon. Because he has missing for over 24 hours, the search mission has changed from rescue to a recovery mission . No life jacket: Logan fell from this boat, which his grandfather was piloting. Logan's life jacket was found inside the boat . The rescue boats are equipped with side-imaging technology, which allows officials to pinpoint certain targets underwater that could be Logan. Once something is detected divers are dent down . Maye told police that, about 60 seconds later, he turned around and Logan was gone. The life jacket was still in the boat. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission have since been searching around the clock for Logan, along with other assisting agencies and some good samaritans. 'The way it works is we set up search patterns,' Lt. Berryman told Fox 10. 'We have boats that are working the perimeters, and we have boats that are working a grid type pattern going back and forth' Berryman said crews are also searching for Logan with aircrafts. Most of the boats used in the search are equipped with side-imaging technology, which allows officials to pinpoint certain targets underwater that could be Logan. For every target that is picked up, a diver is sent down to check it out. Tragic: Logan Torrance Fontana of Pensacola disappeared from his grandfather¿s boat Saturday as they were coming home from a day of fishing near Fort Pickens in Pensacola Bay. He is presumed dead . Search crews worked around the clock to try and find Logan but have not yet found him. He has been missing since Saturday afternoon . 'Right now we're utilizing our side imaging sonar which is allowing us to canvas and search an area, we're looking from top to bottom in the water column, and then out anywhere from 30 to 50 feet, on each direction of the vessel,' explained Clint Retherford, a commander with Escambia Search and Rescue. Because Logan has not been found within 24 hours of going missing, the search is now considered a recovery, not a rescue.","Logan Torrance Fontana disappeared in Pensacola Bay, Florida, on Saturday afternoon .

"By . Alex Greig . A musical therapist who works with terminally ill children and their families at Cincinnati Children's Hospital has begun creating musical memories using the heartbeats of dying patients. Brian Schreck records the thump of a patient's heartbeat using an improvised stethoscope microphone, and then lays an instrumental version of their favorite song over the top. The result is a precious preservation of the patient's humanity, says Schreck. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . From the heart: Musical therapist Brian Schreck uses an improvised stethoscope microphone to record the heartbeats of dying patients . Precious legacy: Schreck then records an instrumental of the patient's favorite song and lays it over the heartbeat . Schreck was struck by the need to preserve some essence of a person when a mother whose daughter was dying told him she was afraid she would forget her daughter's voice. He would record musical therapy sessions with patients to leave their family with a collection of memories and music, but when he began working in the intensive care units with dying patients, it became difficult to capture these moments. 'Some of these patients cannot speak, whether it is due to their age (infant), progression of illness, or intensive medical care (intubation),' writes Schreck in a blog about his work. After seeing a story on the news of a woman's response to hearing her deceased daughter's heart beating inside a donor recipient's chest, Schreck realized he could capture a patient's 'rhythmic essence' and create music that is meaningful to the patient and their family. Powerless: When Margaret and Jeremy's son Dylan passed away, they felt completely helpless . Never miss a beat: The Bennetts listen to the recording Schreck made of their son's heart marking the beat to his favorite song, Ed Sheeran's Lego Man, every single day . 'The heartbeat is the most basic, beautiful metronome. It is such a powerful, audible representation of life and of the human experience,' says Schreck. When Margaret and Jeremy Bennett's son Dylan, 14, lay dying, he felt an overwhelming sense of powerlessness. 'Our son was dying in front of us, and it was very tough. So just to hear that music, it really, really got my spirits up and I needed that,' says Jeremy Bennett. A musical life: Brian Schreck (left) with saxophonist Jeff Coffin of the Dave Matthews Band, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones . Now, the Bennetts listen to the resulting song, Ed Sheeran's Lego House, underlaid with the steady beat of their son's heart, every day. 'To be able to have that, and carry it around on my phone. It's his heartbeat, you know? I can listen to his heartbeat whenever I choose to,' says Jeremy Bennett. Over the last six months, Schreck has made a dozen songs, music as diverse as John Legend and Metallica, for patients and families to help them cope. Schreck says many have played the heartbeat songs at the patient's funerals. 'To let me know that it’s in some way helping with their ability to cope with the very early onset of grief is a very rewarding thing,' he says.","Brian Schreck is a musical therapist at Cincinnati Children's Hospital who works with sick patients and their families .

Speaking to assembled media, Prayuth said he and was concerned about increasingly violent confrontations between the ousted government and dispersed demonstrators. Prayuth also justified the putsch that was declared last Thursday, saying he had to restore order after seven months of violent confrontations and political turmoil between the now-ousted government and demonstrators who had called repeatedly for the army to intervene. 'The most important thing right now is to keep peace and order in the country... When the conflict intensified, and there was the threat of violence, we had to act', he said. In sporadic violence since last November, 28 people have been killed and more than 800 injured in grenade attacks, gun fights and drive-by shootings. 'I am not here to argue with anyone.

It's no use' Since last week, the military has sought to limit the protests by detaining figures who might play leadership roles. The junta has defended the detentions of former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, most of the deposed government's Cabinet, and dozens of politicians and activists. It also has ordered dozens of outspoken activists, academics and journalists to report to military authorities. More than 200 - the majority considered opponents of the new regime - have been officially summoned so far in lists broadcast on radio and TV. The fate of Yingluck, who surrendered herself Friday, and many others remains unclear. Some detainees have been released, and the military has said it expects to free most after about a week. Prayuth said the media must 'control your message. Anyone who posts on Facebook that incites, I consider that against the peace of the country'. 'Do you really want to go back to the old days? Right now there are people coming out to protest... Do your really want to go back?

"By . Joel Christie . Well, it's one way to try and get out of a fine. But for one 19-year-old California man, it's just lead to a whole stack of additional charges. Manual Montano Herrera was arrested in Marysville on Saturday after he was caught crashing into a red-light camera and then speeding off with it in the back of his truck. Police say Herrera lost control of his blue Toyota pickup and slammed into the Redflex pole about 6.30am, according to News10. Snapped: Manual Montano Herrera, 19, ran into a red-light camera in Marysville, California, on Saturday morning, and took off with it in the back of his truck. When he stopped at a nearby street to readjust the pole, a walker took a picture and called police . Scene: Police say Herrera struck this pole and the traffic camera, which was mounted where the traffic cone is in this picture . When Herrera hit the pole, it is said to have fallen straight into the back of his truck, witnesses say. He told police he didn't stop because he was late for work . Manual Montano Herrera was allegedly caught trying to dump the 6ft red light camera pole at a friend's house (pictured) 'The pole ended up flipping over into the back of the bed of the vehicle,' a paramedic who saw it unfold told CBS Sacramento. 'The vehicle sped off and actually stopped at the next light and turned the corner from there and took off.' Herrera is said to have driven for about two miles before pulling over in a suburban street. While adjusting the camera pole in the back of his truck, a witness took a photo. The photo helped police identify Herrera by running his registration. All that remained at the scene was torn wires that were attached to the camera . The teen was located some time later at a friend's house allegedly trying to dump the pole. He told authorities he took off because he was late for work. Herrera has now been charged with hit-and-run traffic collision and grand theft.","Incident occurred in Marysville, California, about 6.30am Saturday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A train carrying a load of military vehicles crashed into a semi-truck that was stranded on tracks near Chowchilla, California on Sunday afternoon. The dramatic crash was caught on the cellphone camera of motorist a who was waiting at the rail crossing at Vista Avenue and Highway 99. The truck driver had already exited the vehicle and was walking up and down the tracks trying to warn the oncoming train. Incredibly, no one was injured in the smash. Stranded: The truck came to a stop at the worst possible place: over train tracks. The truck's driver can be seen running along the tracks trying to signal to the train . Impact: The train hits the stranded truck to the horror of onlookers . See Tae had seen the truck stopped directly over the tracks and began to film events as he realized a train was fast approaching the vehicle. The truck's driver was frantically waving his arms in an attempt to signal to the oncoming train, but the train couldn't stop. The moment of impact shows the train going straight through the truck leaving the cab relatively unscathed, but the trailer's cargo of packaged trail mix bursts out all over the tracks. The mile-long train was carrying hundreds of Stryker armored personnel carriers from Washington to California, reports ABC30. Trail on the tracks: The truck was carrying boxes of packaged trail mix . Fortunate: The truck's driver and the train's crew were lucky not to have been injured by the impact . Freight train: The train stretched for a mile back and was carrying military vehicles from Washington to California . Another motorist, driving on the other side of the tracks, and fascinated by the semi's unusual cargo of military vehicles, was filming when he realized the train was going to plow through the truck. Robin Thissen, driving with his parents on Highway 99, screamed when he realized what was about to happen, but kept recording. 'Stop, Dad, stop... oh my God, we are going to die!' he can be heard yelling. Other side of the tracks: Robin Thissen recorded the smash from the other side, where the truck driver can be seen in front of the cab of the semi-truck . Dusty trail: Despite the huge mess of trail mix and debris, the tracks were cleared within a few hours . He told ABC30 that had they been five or 10 seconds ahead of where they were he and his parents would have been involved in the accident. 'Is the truck going to fly into traffic in front of us? Is the train going to derail? Is there going to be an explosion?' he was thinking, he told ABC30. 'The truck was right in front of us, maybe another five or ten seconds we would have been in this truck lane, we would have been destroyed, we would have been killed in this.'

So far, officials have named 16-year-olds Michael Mahl and Ella Myers as two of the victims who attended Aldo Leopold Charter School. The third high-schooler and pilot have not yet been identified. It has been revealed that the pilot offered to fly the three students over the area burned in a wildfire last week in the Gila National Forest, north of Silver City. Victims: Ella Myers and Michael Mahl, both 16, were two of the three students who died in Friday's plane crash. The other student has not been identified . Witnesses saw the plane make an abrupt 180 turn before landing and bursting into flames in a field . The plane was owned by Albuquerque psychiatrist Dr Peter Hochla. It was when the plane returned around 4pm and was trying to land at Whiskey Creek airport that they ran into trouble. Witnesses . say they saw the plane flying upside down before tilting sideways and . veering 180-degrees before crashing in a field near a trailer park where . it burst into flames. 'The plane was sputtering, and it just . went straight down,' witness Robert Huerta told the Silver City Daily . Press. 'It fell in a vacant lot right south of the trailers… (the fire) must have shot up 200, 300 feet in the air.' It has been revealed that the pilot had offered to take the three students out for a ride to see the damage a recent wildfire had caused. Above, Michael Mahl . Forty to 50 emergency responders showed up to battle the flames and evacuate the area, but none of the victims survived. Investigators are still trying to figure out what caused the plane to crash.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . JK Rowling's new detective novel is at the centre of a row between her New York publisher and online retailer Amazon over the price of e-books. The ongoing standoff has seen Amazon remove pre-order buttons for a number of titles published by Hachette, including 'The Silkworm', which Rowling has written under the pen name Robert Galbraith. Previous changes had been more subtle, such as the listing for the paperback version of J.D. Salinger's Nine Stories being changed to say delivery will now take three to five weeks, accompanied with notes offering similar items by rival publishers at a lower price and faster delivery time. 'Currently unavailable': Amazon has stopped selling some books by publisher Hachette, including JK Rowling's new detective novel The Silkworm (pictured), which was written under the pen name Robert Galbraith . Amazon and . Hachette are reportedly at odds over terms for e-book prices, at a time . when Amazon is in a position of strength and vulnerability. The . Seattle-based company is the most powerful force in the book market, . believed to have a share of more than 60 percent of e-book sales and at . least a third of book sales overall. 'We are doing everything in our power to find a solution to this difficult situation, one that best serves our authors and their work, and that preserves our ability to survive and thrive as a strong and author-centric publishing company,' Hachette said in a statement Friday issued through spokeswoman Sophie Cottrell. Amazon declined to comment. Numerous Hachette authors have criticized Amazon in recent weeks, including Sherman Alexie and James Patterson, who on his Facebook page noted that the purchase of books written by him, Malcolm Gladwell, Nicholas Sparks and others had been made more difficult. 'What I don't understand about this particular battle tactic is how it is in the best interest of Amazon customers,' Patterson wrote. 'It certainly doesn't appear to be in the best interest of authors.' The ongoing standoff has seen Amazon remove pre-order buttons for the new novel by JK Rowling (right). Writers such as James Patterson (left) are among those to have spoken out against Amazon . Speaking out: Hugely popular novelist James Patterson posted this notice on his Facebook fan page earlier this month, saying Amazon's approach is in no ones interest . Rivals have struggled to compete with Amazon's discounts and customer service. But recent earnings reports have been disappointing and Amazon's stock prices, which surged for years despite narrow profits, have dropped sharply in 2014. Amazon has a history of aggressive actions with publishers, most dramatically in 2010 when it removed the buy buttons for releases by Macmillan, where authors include Jonathan Franzen, Bill O'Reilly and Augusten Burroughs. The issue was also e-books. Apple was about to launch its iBookstore and Macmillan, Hachette and other publishers, worried over Amazon's $9.99 offerings for popular e-books, wanted Amazon to accept a new system — the agency model — that would allow publishers to set the prices. Amazon relented, but the system unraveled after the U.S. Department of Justice sued Apple and five publishers in 2012 for alleged price fixing. The publishers, including Macmillan and Hachette, settled and a federal judge in New York last year ruled against Apple. Other books currently being delayed or otherwise disrupted include Tina Fey's Bossypants, Gladwell's The Tipping Point and Brad Stone's The Everything Store, a critical portrait of Amazon and founder Jeff Bezos. Hachette is a multinational conglomerate with headquarters in Paris. In 2006, the company acquired Time Warner Book Group for half a billion dollars. In 2013 Hachette bought Disney's adult trade publishing imprint, Hyperion. Hachette's parent company, Lagardère Group - a publisher, broadcaster and retailer whose magazine titles include French Elle and Paris Match - recorded $7.37bn in net sales in 2012, according to its annual report.","Amazon has stopped pre-sale orders for titles published by Hachette .

"By . Lucy Crossley . The photo editor of the famed National Geographic magazine has raided the publication's vast archive of 11.5 million images and selected her favourites for an online auction. For more than a 125 years the pages of National Geographic magazine have been filled with stunning images captured by photographers from across the globe - making senior photo editor Elizabeth Krist's task of selecting the best particularly daunting. Among the 70 eventually selected for the online sale with National Geographic, 'Limitless: Iconic Photographs From National Geographic: Editor's Choice', include an array of stunning shots that capture the magic of daily life - from a young seal playing off the Canadian coast, to hoards of people basking in the warm waters of the Szechenyi Baths in Hungarian capital Budapest. Playful: Photographer Brian Skerry's shot of a young Harp seal in the waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada, is one of 70 images from National Geographic magazine selected as part of a Christie's online auction . Steamy: Photgrapher Ami Vitale took this shot of hoards of bathers enjoying the warmth of the Szechenyi Baths in Budapest, Hungary in 2012. The image is among 70 for sale through the Christie's website . Global appeal: For more than a 125 years the pages of National Geographic magazine have been filled with stunning images, such as this photograph of the hot springs at Hveravellir in Iceland, captured by Erlend Haarberg . Fine art prints of the images are being sold through the Christie's website until tomorrow, with starting prices of $400. Some of the photographs have been attracting bids of more than $1,000, with one image featuring a family of African elephants in currently at $3,500. Also featured in the varied collection, the third collaboration with Christie's, are images dating back to the 1940s, among them awe-inspiring landscapes, animals and people taken by photographers including Carsten Peter and Jodi Cobb. 'It was a really different experience trying to curate the auction because I'm so used to curating for magazine stories in which you're really looking for a series of images that tell a story,' said Ms Krist. Celebration: Sarah Leen's The Silver Man, featuring a reveller coated in silver body paint while wearing a mask and cardboard crown, was taken during the carnival celebrations at San Nicolas de los Ranchos, Puebla State, Mexico in 1998 . Awe-inspiring: Photographer Carsten Peter journeyed to Mount Erebus on Ross Island, Antarctica to capture this shot of biologists scaling an ice tower in 2012 . 'I'm always looking for a narrative and how all the different images will fit together but in this case it was such a luxury because you're just looking for pure sensuous beauty. 'Each image can just stand on its own. 'While it's true that while I'm selecting images for a magazine story I'm looking for those dynamic points in the story, whereas for the auction I feel the images can be more contemplative. They do not have to be about something, they can just convey an emotion and that really can be enough.' Ms Krist selected her favourite images after combing through the National Geographic's huge picture database containing every image featured in the magazine, dating back to 1888. Old and new: David Bowman tool this picture at St Paul, Minnesota earlier this year, and it joined images dating back to the 1940s in the Christie's collection . Under the sea: A diver kneels beneath the bow of Russian destoyer 356, renamed the MV Keith Tibbetts, that was sunk as an artificial reef off Cayman Brac, Cayman Islands . Timing: Photographers Diane Cook and Len Jenshel managed to capture the exact moment these Fourth of July fireworks exploded over the New York skyline . As well as searching through the archive, which features more than 11.5 million images, she scoured books published by the magazine and previous collections compiled for exhibitions, selecting 250, which the auction house then whittled down to 70 prints. 'I could have kept going forever and the more time I had the more diamonds I could have kept digging up,' she said. 'The scope of the images we have included in the auction is so broad. 'We have portraits, we have landscapes, we have wildlife - but I think there is one quality that runs through all of the photographs and that's a sense of the photographer's innate curiosity.'

"By . Ryan Gorman . The family of a Connecticut couple killed only inches from their children when a 70-foot tall tree fell on their car as it traveled on a major highway are suing the state for millions. The 2007 tragedy claimed the lives of Dr Joseph Stavola, 46, and his lawyer wife Jeanne Stavola, 42, while their two sons aged seven and nine-years=old watched in horror from the back seat. Both children survived, but it took nearly seven years to file a lawsuit because of what the Hartford Currant called a ‘system for winnowing out legal claims against it.’ Scenic: Tress famously line the Merritt Parkway for the bulk of it's length . The March 28 lawsuit is believed to seek $6million for the death of Joseph Stavola, $5million for the death of his wife, and an additional $2million each for James and William Stavola, the couple’s now-teenaged children. The Currant reported that it is not known precisely what the suit demands, but that those were the numbers provided in a 2012 court hearing before the ‘claims commissioner,’ a person who decides whether the state is liable for damages. That claims commissioner decided the state is possibly liable, and allowed the suit to proceed, according to the paper. ‘James and William Stavola witnessed their parents' tragic death from the back seat and sustained significant physical and emotional injuries as a result of having done so,’ the suit says, according to the Currant. ‘Defendants [the State of Connecticut] had a duty to use reasonable care to keep its property in a condition that did not endanger motorists like the Stavola family,’ it continues. ‘As part of that duty, [they] also had a duty to inspect and/or ensure that the trees on its property were maintained in a reasonably safe condition.’ Lawyers for the Stavolas claim the pine tree that fell on their car was ‘defective’ because its trunk had rotted. That decay caused the tree to fall onto the roadway and through the windshield, destroying the family’s Volvo and killing both parents, according to reports. ‘[This] could and should have been avoided, if the Department of Transportation had simply done its job,’ the family’s lawyer wrote to the claims commissioner. ‘It didn't and two people are dead.’ The state defended its inspections to the paper by saying summer and winter drive-bys ‘are a reasonable and recognized method of inspecting roadside trees.’ A judge will eventually decide who is right, but that may not happen for years.","A 70-foot pine tree fell on the car of Joseph and Jeanne Stavola in 2007, killing both of them .

"By . John Hall . Pioneer: Charles Darwin told his son about having had a passion for ice hockey prior to 1825 . Canada's national pride has been dealt a serious blow after Britain laid to inventing ice hockey - claiming Charles Darwin was one of the sport's first ever participants. A recently-discovered letter sent by the famous naturalist in 1853 asks his young son if he has a good pond at school, adding: 'I used to be very fond of playing at Hocky [sic] on the ice in skates'. The letter casts serious doubt on generally accepted Canadian claims that ice hockey was invented in the country in the 1870s and that the first proper match was played in Montreal in 1875. Darwin's letter was sent to his then 13-year-old son William, who was boarding at Shrewsbury School at the time, on March 1, 1853. 'My Dear Old Willy… have you got a pretty good pond to skate on? I used to be very fond of playing at Hocky [sic] on the ice in skates,' he wrote. The evolutionary theorist had himself attended the school as a boarder between 1818 and 1825 himself, and it is thought his reference to enjoying 'hockey on the ice' relates to this time. If that is the case, ice hockey would have been played in Britain at least 50 years earlier than the first officially recognised match in Canada, where is it now a national sport and general obsession. The claim will come as something of a blow to Canadians, who are taught to play the game almost as soon as they learn to walk. Jean-Patrice Martel, a member of the Society for International Hockey . Research, poured fuel of the fire by claiming the early 1820s was around the time that a game . recognisable as ice hockey started. 'We expect a lot of people won’t believe it and some will have much difficulty in believing it,' he told The Independent. 'It’s something you have been told since you were the youngest age, that you’ve been told by your parents,' he added. Despite potentially breaking Canadian . hearts with his claims, Martel gave them at least something to hold on . to by suggesting the ice hockey played in Britain in the early 1800s . would have been a slow, primitive sport compared to the high-energy, . high-impact game we know and love today. On the Origins of Ice Hockey: The sport may have been played in Britain at least 50 years earlier than the first officially recognised match in Canada, where is it now a national sport and general obsession (pictured) 'We wouldn’t want to say Canada has no claim at all [to the game] – that’s not true... Canada took the game, sped it up and made it better. Canada really made the game its own and hockey is truly a Canadian game now'. The Darwin letter appears in a new book French Canadian Martel wrote alongside two Swedish colleagues, medical doctor Carl Giden and sports writer Patrick Houda. Titled 'On the Origins of Hockey' in a deliberate nod to Darwin's seminal work 'On the Origins of Species', the trio also found an entry in the Lincolnshire Chronicle dated February 16, 1838 that backs up claims the ice hockey was being played in Britain in the first half of the 19th century. The entry reads: 'On Saturday last, an amusing scene took place on a splendid sheet of ice which covered Croxby Pond. 'A large party from the neighbouring residence of Geo. Alington, Esq., of Swinhop House, drove up in sledges to the pond. 'The ladies were drawn upon the ice in traineau, while the gentlemen performed various feats upon their skates: after going through several quadrilles, reels and playing a warmly contested game at hockey, the party partook of a cold collation, and again stepping into their sledges, glided swiftly away.' Reacting to the claims made in the book, Toronto newspaper The National Post called the idea of ice hockey being invented in Britain a 'puck-shattering thought', adding it is 'sure to rankle Canadian hockey patriots'.","Letter suggests Charles Darwin played hockey in Britain before 1825 .

The . photographs of the reptilian pile-up were taken at Haus des Meeres Aqua . Terra Zoo in Vienna, Austria by 45-year-old Hans Jorg Leth. The retail manager, who lives in the city of Graz, said he took the comical photograph after spending an afternoon at the zoo earlier this month. Pile-up: The hilarious accident took place when the first snapping turtle stopped abruptly. The two following closely behind him failed to notice he had come to a halt and were moving too quickly to stop in time, leaving the trio piled on top off one another . After the initial three-turtle pile up, several more lined up behind. Within just a few minutes seven turtles were left waiting patiently in line for the first turtle to get himself moving again. 'There were a lot of visitors at the zoo on the day I took that picture,' Mr Leth said. 'It seems that the first snapping turtle stopped to have a view of the crazy looking visitors who were staring at him... There were two other turtles walking behind him and were going too fast to stop in time,' he added. 'The three turtles all landed on top of each other - it was very funny,' he went on to say. What's the hold up? After the initial three-turtle pile up, several more lined up behind. Within just a few minutes seven turtles were left waiting patiently in line for the first turtle to get himself moving again. The photographs of the reptilian pile-up were taken at Haus des Meeres Aqua Terra Zoo in Vienna, Austria . Common snapping turtles, with their powerful beak-like jaws and highly mobile head and neck, are known for their aggressive personality when out of the water. Their natural habitat extends from southeastern Canada to the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, and as far east as Nova Scotia and Florida. In some areas they are hunted very heavily for their meat, as they are a popular ingredient in turtle soup. Some common snapping turtles have lived for up to 47 years in captivity, but the lifespan of those in the wild is estimated to be around 30 years. Haus des Meeres Aqua Terra Zoo opened in 1957 and is one of Austria's best known aquariums - housing over 10,000 aquatic beings in an area of around 43,000 square feet. It is run for no profit by the privately owned Aqua Terra Zoo organisation, and attracts an estimated 430,000 visitors every year.","One snapping turtle came to a sudden halt, but two behind failed to notice the their path was blocked .

"By . Sophie Freeman . According to a leading psychiatrist, parents should avoid being ‘tigers’, at no point become ‘jellyfish’ and do their best to raise their offspring as though they were a ‘dolphin’. This might sound bafflingly irrelevant to the daily grind of the school run, but mother-of-three Dr Shimi Kang believes children of micromanaging tiger parents risk suffering from anxiety and depression. Mother-of-three Dr Shimi Kang claims . ‘tiger’ parents - who ‘overparent’ and micromanage their children’s . lives in a bid to achieve excellence – end up removing their child’s . sense of internal control and self-motivation. According to psychiatrist Dr Shimi Kang, parents should neither become 'jellyfish' - who bring children up to lack self-control - nor 'tigers', who 'overparent' and micromanage their children's lives . At the other end of the spectrum, permissive 'jellyfish' parents raise children who lack self-control and have poor social skills. However dolphin parents have rules and expectations, but value creativity and independence. The doctor, whose book, The Dolphin Way, is published this month, said this type of parenting has two distinct parts. ‘The first is a balanced, authoritative parent-child relationship,’ she said. Parents should do their best to raise their offspring as though they . were a 'dolphin' because those parents apparently have rules and . expectations - but also value creativity and independence . ‘The second is a balanced lifestyle, including what many of today’s kids are missing – play and exploration, a sense of community and contribution, and the basics of regular sleep, exercise and rest. ‘Parents must stop over-scheduling, overprotecting and being over-competitive to allow their children the time and space to activate their own intrinsic motivators.’ Dr Kang, who trained at Harvard, said children of tiger parents are at higher risk of anxiety, depression, entitlement, poor decision-making, and difficulty establishing healthy independence. Children of jellyfish parents may turn to peers for guidance and fail to develop self-control. ‘They (children of jellyfish parents) are at higher risk of poor social skills, risk-taking behaviours, and substance use,' she said. ‘Many modern parents flip-flop between tiger and jellyfish leaving their child with no consistent message.’","Dr Shimi Kang says 'dolphin' parents have rules but also value independence .

After dropping off two crew members in Hilo, Berg and one female crew member began circling the island to make port in Kailua Kona. But Berg's state-of-the-art navigational equipment failed him and he wandered into rough waters - slamming the Seaquel into coral not far from his destination. 'He wandered into the surf. It was navigational error. They got too close to the shore and the waves picked them up and threw them on the beach,' John Dour, who lives in Kailua Kona, told Hawaii News Now the day after the wreck. Berg and the female crew member reportedly survived the wreck without injury, and tied themselves to each other to swim to shore in the dark. 'The guy was completely devastated. He lived on that boat for 14 years. You know he lost his home. Everything,' Dour said. Berg had no insurance on his vessel, and the following morning he found the boat totally stripped of all its expensive equipment. 'They stole the bimini. They stole the winches. They stole the (steering) wheel off the boat,' Dour says. Friends have described Berg as an accomplished sea man who sailed competitively with his high-tech equipment. 'All of his electronics talk to him. He gets email that talk to him so he didn't have to read anything,' friend John Harold said. Uninjured: Berg and a female crew member made it safely to shore, swimming in the dark . Homeless: Berg doesn't have insurance for his vessel. He has lived on it for 14 years meaning he has also lost his home . A salvage crew was hired by the Hawaiian government to get the boat out of the water last week . 'He's one of the most knowledgeable people I've ever known,' he added. The Department of Land and Natural Resources hirde a salvage company to remove the boat last week, and could hit Berg with fines for damaging the coral.","John Berg of California successfully completed a 2,800 mile sail from Mexico to Hawaii when he crashed his boat named the Seaquel last week .

"By . Bianca London . It seems that Gemma Collins is taking the mantra 'no carbs before Marbs' seriously. The TOWIE star and fashion designer checked into raw-vegan detox retreat Slimmeria to embark on a gruelling diet and exercise regime. However, the 32-year-old reportedly escaped during the night, just six hours after arriving. It started so well: Gemma Collins, everyone's favourite TOWIE fashionista, checked into Slimmeria detox retreat - but escaped just six hours later while everyone was sleeping . A source told MailOnline: 'Having arrived with her mother on Thursday, she had a massage, a raw vegan meal then an evening talk on nutrition. 'This must have been too much for her, as at 10pm she and her mother packed their bags and left while the other guests were sleeping. 'She didn't even say goodbye to the owner, and had to ask the housekeeper to unlock the gates.' The luxury retreat, situated in leafy East Sussex, prides itself on its natural detox and fasting regime, supplemented with freshly prepared raw vegetables, juices and soups. Hours before escaping: A source told MailOnline: 'At 10pm she and her mother packed their bags and left whilst the other guests were sleeping' Not right for her: The staff at Slimmeria, pictured, think that the raw vegan food wasn't to Gemma's liking . Not giving in that easily! Clearly keen to get in shape ahead of the casts' trip to Marbella, committed Gemma checked straight into another bootcamp, No.1 Bootcamp in Norfolk . 'It will stimulate the . slimming process in a healthy way, and will facilitate quick weight . loss, without resorting to extremes,' promises the retreat's website. 'We think she left as the food was too little for her and she panicked,' added the source. 'The owner said she and her mother were very on edge at the retreat due to the meal plans and strict exercise regime. 'Fellow Essex girl Lydia Bright stayed for the full four days before Gemma checked in but Gemma escaped the locked gates . after six hours, whilst everyone was asleep. The owner has . never had anyone escape the £1,000 per week retreat before.' Well done, Gemma! Miss Collins may not have enjoyed her time at Slimmeria but the designer decided to give bootcamp another go, this time in Norfolk . But rather than head back to Romford to tuck into some Ben & Jerrys, committed Gemma checked straight into another bootcamp, No.1 Bootcamp in Norfolk, a favourite of Binky Felstead and Spencer Matthews. The plus-size designer tweeted: 'Had the most wonderful day now off to @no1bootcamp to shake my booty for the bank holiday no partying for moi!' It seems that Gemma was throwing herself wholeheartedly into the regime, later tweeting: '3 mile run BOOM shak a lak @no1bootcamp @gardenerskbar NO CARBS BEFORE MARBS'. Tough workout: The Only Way Is Essex star Lydia Bright got pulses racing during a vigorous regime with her sister Georgia at the Slimmeria retreat .

"EXCLUSIVE By . James Slack . Armed thug: Andrew Akuffo has been on the run for almost three years. He was serving life for wounding with intent, drugs and firearms offences . A rapist, arsonist, two burglars, a gun criminal and a string of robbers feature on a list of on-the-run convicts that government officials tried to keep secret. The Daily Mail can reveal the fugitives’ identities after Justice Secretary Chris Grayling intervened to end the ‘nonsense’ of their privacy being protected. He said: ‘They are wanted men and should be treated as such.’ A row erupted last week after officials at the Ministry of Justice refused to release the names of 18 criminals who went on the run between May 2010 and March 2013. This newspaper had applied for the names to be released under Freedom of Information laws – pointing out that it could help to track them down. But officials said there was a blanket ban on releasing the criminals’ identities because it was their own ‘personal data’ and it would be ‘unfair’ to them. The decision was taken without the knowledge of Mr Grayling who has now overruled the civil servants. Of the original 18 names, he has published 13. They include rapist Robert Jones, arsonist Shied Riasat, burglars Viorel Avadanii and Steven Fortnam and robbers Sean Morrisey, Cesk Hanja and Islam Aslam. Also at large are Andrew Akuffo who was serving life for wounding with intent, drugs and firearms offences, Michael Collinson who was given almost seven years for wounding with intent, and Tom Zolynski, a carer who stole £10,000 from a frail, elderly man. The other three are fraudster Ismail Hasko, drink driver John Wilson and drug dealer Leacroft Wallace. Seven of the inmates walked out of Ford open prison in West Sussex. Wounding with intent: Michael Collinson escaped from his almost seven year sentence two years ago . Stole £10,000: Carer Tom Zolynski was held in an open prison after he stole stole from a pensioner . Of the five names being withheld, two have been recaptured and face criminal charges, while police have asked for three more to remain classified on ‘operational’ grounds. The Mail submitted the Freedom of Information request three weeks ago after Michael ‘Skullcracker’ Wheatley absconded while on temporary release from an open prison. Since then, there have been a string of other incidents of inmates absconding from open conditions, including murderer Arnold Pickering. He, like Wheatley, has been recaptured. Over the weekend, details emerged about four more inmates who had absconded. One, Charlie Casey, 22, who went on the run in April, is wanted after a woman was attacked at a holiday park in Dorset last week. Not secure: Seven of the on-the-run inmates walked out of Ford open prison in West Sussex . Police have been prepared to release details in the immediate aftermath of an inmate disappearing. But the Ministry of Justice would not release a comprehensive list. 'They are wanted men, and should be treated as such': Justice Secretary Chris Grayling announced that names of on-the-run prisoners will be released . Mr Grayling said that would now change. He told the Mail: ‘Prisoners on the run from open prisons have been in the news too often of late. ‘Open prisons are used to prepare those coming to the end of very long sentences for reintegration into society. Without them all the expert advice is that more people would reoffend after release. The number absconding from open prisons is a small fraction of what it was ten years ago under Labour. They’ve conveniently forgotten how bad things were when they were in office. ‘But we take any abscond very seriously, reporting it to the police immediately. The police catch most of them quickly. Even so, I think the rules in open prisons have been too lax, and I am tightening them. ‘There’ll be more stringent risk assessments, tighter rules about what people are allowed to do, and anyone who absconds will get a longer sentence and will be banned from going back to an open prison. ‘From the end of this year, we’ll use GPS tags to monitor where they are. And there’ll be no nonsense about data protection laws when it comes to prisoners on the run. ‘They are wanted men, and should be treated as such. That’s why on my watch we will not hold back their names, unless the police ask us not to for operational reasons.’","Justice Secretary intervenes after Mail's Freedom of Information Request .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Nick Clegg today insisted he had never considered quitting despite leading the Lib Dems into an election bloodbath, losing all but one of the party’s MEPs. In a near wipeout at the ballot box, the pro-EU Lib Dems lost 11 of its 12 seats in Brussels, after Mr Clegg campaigned hard as the leader of the ‘party of in’. But in an apparently emotional interview this afternoon, Mr Clegg insisted the ‘gutting’ result had not led him to consider is position, vowing instead to ‘finish the job’. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg refused to resign after the 'gutting' election results saw all but one of the party's MEPs ousted . The Lib Dems slumped to fifth place in the national share of the vote – to just 7 per cent, behind the Greens. After starting the night with 12 MEPs, the party was reduced to a rump of just one - Catherine Bearder in the South East. While jubilant UKIP celebrated stunning victory – topping the poll and securing 24 MEPS - the Lib Dems were plunged into fresh turmoil with Mr Clegg clinging to his job. His high stakes gamble to take on Mr Farage in two head-to-head TV debates appears to have dramatically backfired. Speaking from Liberal Democrat headquarters in central London, Mr Clegg said: ‘It didn't work but it was right that we stood up for the values we believe in. ‘I'm immensely proud to lead the most united, resilient and toughest party in British politics.' % share of the vote . With 11 of the 12 regions of the UK declared, UKIP has gained 11 seats, with Labour up seven, the Tories down seven and the Lib Dems down 10 . Mr Clegg went on: ‘We made a big commitment to the British people in 2010 to step up to the plate, to form a government, to reform and repair the damaged British economy and to deliver policy after policy after policy that the Liberal Democrats have been campaigning on for generations. That is what we must continue to do. We must finish the job.’ ""f I thought any of our real dilemmas would be addressed by changing leadership... then I wouldn't hesitate advocating it"" Pitching the Lib Dems as the true voice of pro-EU politics in Britain, Mr Clegg saw his MEPs wiped. Around 250 Lib Dems – including candidates, councillors and MPs – have signed a letter calling for him to resign. Mr Clegg went on: ‘If I thought any of our real dilemmas would be addressed by changing leadership, changing strategy, changing approaches, bailing out now, changing direction, then I wouldn't hesitate advocating it. Absolutely not.’ Asked if he has a bunker mentality, he replied: ‘No, not at all’, adding: ‘I'm never going to put myself ahead of the Liberal Democrats.’ In the popular share of the vote the Lib Dems slumped to just 6.87 per cent, barely half what it achieved in 2009. Lib . Dem President Tim Farron said it would be 'foolish' to oust Mr Clegg, . but some party members want Vince Cable to take charge ahead of the 2015 . general election . Lib Dem MP John Pugh has called for Vince Cable to take over as leader to stem the loss of public support . Lib Dem president Tim Farron said the results were 'as bad as I feared' as it faced losing all of its MEPS. Treasury minister Danny Alexander added: 'It has been a pretty awful night for the Liberal Democrats.' But former MP Sandra Gidley said the Lib Dem brand had become ‘toxic’. Lib Dem MP John Pugh said he wanted Business Secretary Vince Cable to take over as leader, warning that a fundamental cause of the Lib Dems' ‘abysmal’ showing was the fact that voters were no longer willing to listen to Mr Clegg. If we carry on as usual, we are like the generals at the Somme, because these losses are horrendous,’ the Southport MP told the BBC News Channel. ‘Given the scale of the losses, to call for business as usual is frankly ludicrous.’ Mr Clegg rejected the criticism: ‘Of course, it is right to have searching questions in the wake of such a bad set of election results, but if I'm honest the easiest thing in politics, just as in life, sometimes when the going gets really tough is just to walk away, to wash your hands of it. I'm not going to do that and my party is not going to do that. ‘At the point when our big decisions, our big judgments are being vindicated, we are not going to buckle, we are not going to lose our nerve. We are not going to walk away. ‘We must argue over and over and over again that if it wasn't for the Liberal Democrats taking that brave decision at considerable short-term cost...we wouldn't have a recovery now and more than that you wouldn't have the kind of recovery. ‘There's just no way the Conservatives left to their own devices could deliver the big changes.’","Lib Dems collapse to 7% of the vote, losing 11 out of 12 MEPs .

"By . Jack Doyle . Ministers are drawing up plans for a new crackdown on migrants’ access to benefits to try to win back disaffected voters from Ukip. The new push, which could see unemployed EU nationals kicked out of the country after just six months, was announced yesterday amid continued fallout from the Ukip surge in last week’s elections. Currently, new arrivals cannot claim benefits for the first three months in the country followed by six months in which they can. Unemployment: Ministers announced new plans to crackdown on migrants' access to benefits. But with most EU migrants in work and not claiming, it would most likely have little effect on soaring net migration figures . Yesterday Home Secretary Theresa May confirmed plans to cut the period in which migrants can claim benefits to just three months. And Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith told The Sunday Times it would be ‘bye bye’ for anyone who had not found work after half a year in the UK. However, the policy faces opposition from the Liberal Democrats, who are yet to sign off on the idea. Critics claimed the policy would have . little impact on David Cameron’s drive to reduce net migration below . 100,000 before the next election, as it would have no effect on the tens . of thousands of arrivals each year who do go on to find work. And . questions were raised about the likelihood of large numbers of . unemployed EU nationals being removed from the UK when ministers . struggle to throw out foreign criminals. Crackdown:: Home Secretary Theresa May yesterday confirmed plans to cut the period in which migrants can claim benefits to just three months . Despite concern about the rise of Ukip, Mr Cameron appears to have escaped the harsh criticism from backbenchers that has dogged Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg since Thursday. Yesterday the only murmurings of discontent came from former shadow home secretary David Davis, who called on Mr Cameron to bring forward by a year to 2016 the proposed referendum on membership of the EU. He said the current policy lacked ‘clarity and credibility’. And he criticised the government’s failure to bring immigration ‘back under control’. He wrote: ‘The Conservative party has to decide pretty soon where its blue lines are and make them very clear. If we do not grasp this nettle, I can see the Ukip resurgence carrying all the way through to the General Election.’ A poll carried out by Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft in marginal seats, suggested Labour had a comfortable 12-point lead over the Tories and showed there was still strong support for Ukip. The survey of key ‘swing’ seats put Labour at 41 per cent, the Tories on 29 and UKIP was on 18 per cent. If repeated next year it could hand Ed Miliband a comfortable majority. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he believed most of those who voted Ukip at the local and European elections last week were ‘lender voters’ who would return to the Tories for the General Election next year. He told Sky News the government had to address ‘specific concerns ... about immigration and about Europe’. He added: ‘Ukip is a protest party; most of the people who are voting for Ukip – not all of them, but most of them – are disillusioned voters of other parties who moved to Ukip to send us a message and we’ve got a year to show that we’ve got that message.’ Curbs: Romanian migrants sleeping rough on the central reservation of Park Lane, central London . Good show: Ukip leader Nigel Farage, celebrates with newly elected councillors in Basildon on Saturday after his party's local election successes . Downing Street sources dismissed Mr Davis’s call to move the referendum forward, saying it wouldn’t make the ‘slightest difference on the doorstep’. However, Mr Hammond said ministers would try to resurrect a proposal to enshrine the EU referendum pledge in law. 'Grasp the nettle': Tory backbencher David Davis called on David Cameron to bring the proposed referendum on EU membership forward to 2016 . Mrs May accepted it had ‘become more difficult’ for ministers to hit their target of cutting net migration – the number of people arriving minus those departing -  to below 100,000 by the time of the next election. Last week figures showed a sharp increase in arrivals from the EU made that target a distant prospect. But she said should would ‘continue working to bring it down’. She also indicated the proposals on benefits were facing opposition from the Lib Dems. At the moment arrivals have three months to try and find work during which they cannot claim benefits, followed by six in which they can. She added: ‘We haven't yet got agreement across the coalition to do that. But these are the sorts of measures we keep looking at because in immigration you can never stand still.’ ‘It is no surprise to anybody that there have been some long-standing, possibly heated at times, discussions among the coalition on some of these issues of immigration.’ The effect of the change would be to halve the length of time when migrants can claim benefits in Britain from six months to three. However, there were immediately questions about the likelihood of large numbers being removed from the country even if they weren’t working. Even if it was implemented, such a policy would have little difference on overall numbers of migrants because most EU immigrants do not claim benefits and are in work.","New proposals could kick unemployed EU migrants out after six months .

"By . Mark Duell . Suicide: Stephen Gale, 57, a partner at a City law firm, drank two bottles of wine most lunchtimes . A top lawyer whose tax affairs were being investigated by HM Revenue & Customs committed suicide, an inquest has heard. Stephen Gale, 57, a partner at City law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, was found in the bath of his penthouse flat in Islington, London, having taken a fatal drugs overdose. He had invested in two tax syndicates which were being probed by HMRC, while his son Sam had been charged with a serious crime and was facing a lengthy jail term if found guilty. Mr Gale’s personal assistant Samantha Andrews, who had worked with him for 12 years, said she had noticed a ‘big’ change in her boss in the months before his death in February. She said that he had seemed distracted, drank two bottles of wine with a whisky chaser most lunchtimes and on one occasion walked around the office building in his socks. Ms Andrews added: ‘He seemed to be running out of steam. He seemed aged all of a sudden - he was forgetting things and seemed to be getting to him. He was in his own little world. He told me he was at the end of his tether. ‘When I saw an email saying his son was in court on Monday, I thought “My God, this is going to finish him off”. I didn’t know what the charges were but it seemed serious - he could go down for a very long time. ‘I remember Stephen telling his mother she would probably never see Sam again. He had invested in a couple of tax syndicates which were being investigated by Customs - he was worried about that. ‘He was generally a happy person and we had a good laugh. But in the couple of months before his death he had changed. He started being rude, he would have outbursts and attack me for no reason. Scene of death: Mr Gale was found in the bath of his penthouse flat in this building in Islington, central London, having taken a fatal drugs overdose . ‘Sometimes when I was speaking he would not grasp what I was saying - I had noticed the change in the past year. He was muddled and forgetful. It seemed sometimes I was thinking for him, as if he couldn’t be bothered, or couldn’t think for himself. I knew he drunk quite a lot. ‘He would drink a whiskey chaser and a couple of bottles of wine at lunch time when he was meeting clients, which was most days. He would think up excuses to get out of the office and he would drink at home. ‘On the Tuesday before his death, I noticed him walking around without shoes. He walked to the other building to get dinner without wearing shoes, which I and another colleague noticed.’ She said she rang the concierge of his flat, Charles Norman, after he had failed to turn up for work on the morning of February 13. Mr Norman told the court: ‘I came out of the lift to find the door of his flat was wide open. I checked in all the rooms. The bathroom seemed shut but when I came back the other way I saw the door was ajar and a light was on.' However, his wife told the inquest that she had noticed no change in the months leading up to his death. The coroner at St Pancras Coroner’s Court, Mary Hassell, ruled Mr Gale had taken his own life after overdosing. She said: ‘Stephen Gale caused his own death and did so intending to cause his death.’ Mr Gale’s wife, Rebecca, who was at their house in Scotland at the time of her husband’s death, told the court that she had no idea he intended to take his own life. Mrs Gale said: ‘He never suffered depression or unhappiness, he never talked about taking his own life and there was no change at all in his character in the time leading up to his death. Inquest: St Pancras Coroner's Court (pictured) was told Mr Gale had taken his own life after overdosing . She told the court how in the days before his death, Mr Gale had made plans to cut wood with a friend the following weekend and had asked for fish pie for his dinner on the day after his death. She said she phoned him the night before his death and he seemed ‘normal’. She said their adopted son Sam was due to appear in court and faced serious charges, but would not say what they were. 'He seemed to be running out of steam. He seemed aged all of a sudden - he was forgetting things and seemed to be getting to him. He was in his own little world. He told me he was at the end of his tether' Samantha Andrews, personal assistant . However she said she and her husband had taken her son’s trouble in his stride, adding: ‘He was not stressed beyond measure - it was more “Oh God, what will Sam do next”.’ In giving her judgement, Ms Hassell said there was a conflict between the image Mr Gale presented to the world and the internal suffering that had led him to take his own life. She added: ‘There is a conflict here, he had a successful life and a happy marriage, there were so many things going for him and he never discussed taking his life. ‘But it is often the case with busy people he sees more of his PA than his loved ones. Her evidence showed he had changed, he was doing things out of character, he was drinking too much and was brusque to her to the point of being rude. ‘He told her he felt at the end of his tether. He was unhappy at the merger, he was involved in big cases, he was being investigated by HMRC and his son appeared likely to go to prison over very serious charges. I have no doubt but that he intended to take his own life.’ In a statement, his firm said: ‘Stephen was a talented restructuring and insolvency partner in our London Finance practice, with extensive experience of insolvency and corporate recovery around the world. Chambers recently described him a “world class” restructuring lawyer. ‘Stephen’s professional life saw him advising on many important and high profile matters for the firm, including acting for Ernst & Young as administrators of Nortel’s European, Middle Eastern and African entities. ‘He also advised JJB Sports on its groundbreaking restructuring and refinancing. In addition, Stephen acted for various Lehman creditors following that organisation’s bankruptcy. ‘He lectured widely on corporate recovery matters. He was also honorary professor in the Faculty of Law at University College London.’","Stephen Gale found dead in his penthouse flat in Islington, London .

Sandbanks' popularity is attributed to its seclusion, and every home in the community is within just a few minutes' walk of the beach, with most of them enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the English Channel. Houses were first built on Sandbanks in the late 19th century, but it  was not until the 1960s when a property boom saw the peninsula - measuring less than half a square mile - become more and more built-up, turning into a Millionaires' Row filled with luxury beachfront mansions. The property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years, with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting-edge new properties to meet demand. In July 2009 a 1,393-square-metre (14,990 sq ft) empty plot of land on the peninsula was put up for sale for £13.5 million – the equivalent of nearly £10,000 per square metre. And earlier this month a bungalow bought for just £1,000 almost a century ago (around £40,000 in today's money) and now a luxury holiday home was reported to be now worth £5million - a 500,000 percent increase in value. Last month a tatty 1950s three-bedroom Sandbanks bungalow which would be worth just £200,000 in most other parts of the country went on sale for an eye-watering £2.25million. In March, an empty plot on the exclusive enclave went on sale for £3million - double what it had sold for before its old bungalow was knocked down. Last year, 15 homes were sold for a combined total of £80million as Sandbanks' s reputation has continued to grow. Notable residents include a number of well-known names in football such as Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis, former player and manager Graeme Souness, Queen's Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp and his son Jamie. Computer magnate Sir Peter Ogden also has a home there.","Ultra-modern four-storey mansion is situated near home of Queens Park Rangers' manager Harry Redknapp .

"By . Dan Bloom . Rusting dog tags worn by the hero pilot Sir Douglas Bader while he languished in a Nazi Prisoner of War Camp are being auctioned for up to £1,800. The Second World War ace was captured in August 1941 after his plane crashed into another in mid-air over Le Touquet, France. After successfully escaping his captors - despite having artificial legs - he was eventually sent to Germany's top-security Colditz Castle where he was forced to remain until the war ended. Now two tags, one issued by the RAF and the other made by the Nazis with the label 'Oflag IV-C', Colditz's codename, will be among 350 Second World War lots auctioned next month. Scroll down for video . Memorabilia: Two rusting dog tags (left) worn by RAF pilot Douglas Bader during his time in the German Prisoner of War camp at Colditz Castle are expected to fetch £1,800 at auction. Right: The pilot in 1940 . A piece of history: A close-up image of the tags. The smaller octagonal tag was issued by the RAF to identify the pilot if he died in battle, and the larger German tag was stamped with Oflag IV-C, the codename for Colditz . Sir Douglas, who lost both his legs in a 1931 flying accident, became one of the Second World War's most celebrated pilots for his uncompromising and fearless approach. Memorabilia of the pilot for sale also includes his RAF car hood ornament and two of his flying caps - which are expected to sell for more than £4,000 each. Bonhams will hold the auction in New York on June 5, a day before the 70th anniversary of the 'D-Day' Normandy landings. Sir Douglas' German-issued tag is stamped with his prisoner number 3797, which also appeared on his 'Wanted' poster when he escaped. Heritage: Also for sale are a flying cap worn by Sir Douglas (pictured) and several scarves . It is joined by an octagonal RAF tag, designed to identify him if he died in battle, pressed with his service number of 26151 and suspended from a single waxed cotton cord. The items were handed by Sir Douglas after he was freed from Colditz to his colleague Arthur Dunn, the Officer's Mess Clerk at RAF Duxford. Dunn had already been looking after Sir Douglas' uniform and personal items after he was taken prisoner. When the war ended, he took possession of the dog tags. Sir Douglas lived a long and prosperous life after the war, being promoted to group captain after his release and leading a victory flypast of 300 aircraft over London. He left the RAF in 1946 for a job with Shell Aircraft and joined the Civil Aviation Authority in 1969. Four years later he published his celebrated autobiography and he was knighted for his work for other amputees. The pilot continued flying until ill-health stopped him aged 69, and he died of a heart attack three years later in September 1982. It is not the first time his dog tags have been sold. The RAF tags were issued in pairs, and the other one was sold at auction in 1999 along with his wristwatch, tunic and cap for almost £12,000. The auction features 350 lots, including manuscripts, photographs, wartime technology, authentic weaponry, personal mementos and battlefield souvenirs. Highlights include a German Army Enigma enciphering machine which could fetch around £50,000. Also expected to raise around £50,000 is an original print of the iconic photograph of American troops raising the flag at Iwo Jima, which was sent from Associated Press Guam to San Francisco. Moment in time: Also being auctioned is a print sent to San Francisco of this now-iconic photo of U.S. troops raising the flag atop Mount Suribachi in Hiro Jima, Japan. Photographer Joe Rosenthal won a Pulitzer prize . Tom Lamb, Bonhams' business development director for the books and manuscripts department in New York, said: 'Every object in the sale has an incredible story to tell. 'They bear witness to the war's unparalleled turmoil, and testify to the bravery of many individuals as well as entire nations. 'Presenting the sale on the eve of the 70th anniversary of D-Day is a way of honouring this momentous day and recognising the tragic losses on all sides.' A string of high-profile events across Britain will mark the 70th anniversary of the Normandy landings on June 6. They will include a display by the Red Arrows in Portsmouth followed by a flotilla of ships sailing to France. A memorial service will also be held at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. Ace: Sir Douglas, pictured with a remote-controlled Spitfire shortly before his death in 1982, continued to fly until he was prevented by ill health aged 69. He was knighted for his services to other amputees . On June 6, 1944, thousands of allied troops bombed, shelled and landed on the beaches at Normandy marking the beginning of the European invasion and major offensive against the Nazis. A total of 75,215 British and Canadian troops and 57,500 U.S. troops were landed by sea, with another 23,400 landed by air. Around 10,000 soldiers and civilians are estimated to have been killed during the bloody fighting, which ultimately opened the gateway to victory for Britain and its allies. Struggle: The pilot hauling his artificial limbs into the cockpit of a Spitfire to lead a memorial flight . Sir Douglas Robert Steuart Bader CBE was credited with 20 aerial victories, four shared victories and many other probable victories. He joined the RAF in 1928 and was commissioned in 1930, but in December 1931, he crashed and lost both his legs while attempting an aerobatic display. The pilot recovered from the brink of death and retook flight training, passed his check flights and then requested reactivation as a pilot. After the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, he was accepted and returned to the RAF. He scored his first victories over Dunkirk during the Battle of France in 1940 and then took part in the Battle of Britain. When his Spitfire crashed in 1941, his artificial limbs may have saved his life. One of his feet was trapped under a pedal and he could only bail out because he could detach the leg. His lack of extremities also left him less vulnerable to G-forces which caused many pilots to black out when their blood drained away from their heads. Despite his disability, he made a number of escape attempts from the clutches of the Nazis. In one, a French farmer and his wife hid Sir Douglas in their barn - and when he was found they were sent to a concentration camp. Sir Douglas was eventually sent to the 'escape-proof' POW camp at Colditz Castle, where he remained until April 1945 when the camp was liberated. But his abilities earned him respect among his captors. German General Adolf Galland told the British about the pilot's damaged legs and allowed Winston Churchill to send replacements safely by plane. The same plane then continued on its way to drop bombs on German targets. During the 1950s, a book and a film, Reach for the Sky, starring Kenneth More, chronicled Sir Douglas' life and RAF career to the end of the Second World War.","One tag issued by RAF was designed to identify the ace if he died in battle .

"By . Hugo Gye . A British grandmother on her dream holiday in Brazil died after she slipped on a walkway overlooking one of the world's largest waterfalls. Shirley Baldry, a retired teacher, was visiting the 270ft Iguazu falls on the Argentinian border when she fell and broke her arm, an inquest heard. She was flown to hospital in Rio de Janeiro, where doctors put a pin in her arm - but the 79-year-old from Tyne and Wear died just a few days later, after the shock caused her to have a heart attack. Accident: Shirley Baldry, pictured in front of the Taj Mahal with husband Ted, died in Brazil last November . Paying tribute to his wife of 60 years, husband Ted said: 'I loved everything about her, absolutely everything. She was just so important to me and everybody loved her.' An inquest in Newcastle heard that Mrs Baldry had been on holiday with her daughter Stephanie in November last year when she suffered the accident. Stephanie was initially told that the operation had gone well, but Mrs Baldry's condition continued to deteriorate and she died shortly afterwards. A post-mortem carried out in Britain revealed that she had been suffering from ischaemic heart disease, exacerbated by the shock of the fall and her hospitalisation. Danger: The retired teacher slipped and fell while visiting the Iguazu falls, pictured, on the border with Argentina . Pathologist Clive Bloxham told the inquest: 'I am inclined to put it as a contributing factor. It is recent and may have influenced the timing of what is essentially a heart attack.' Coroner Karen Dilks recorded a verdict of accidental death. 'When I kissed her goodbye at Kings Cross I did not realise it would be the last time,' said Mr Baldry, 82. 'We had both wanted to go to Brazil. I could not and she had the air miles, and she went with Stephanie. She had the chance so I said go - it was only meant to be for five to six days.' Mrs Baldry was a keen fitness fan, and could often be seen running along the beach with the family dog. Husband: Mr Baldry paid tribute to his wife, a fitness fanatic who loved travelling around the world . 'We were both in a walking club, she was just so fit,' her husband said. 'Before she went away she did a 10-mile then a 12-mile walk, she went running on the beach with the dog. 'She would do that two to three times a day, she was never out of breath. Even our doctor couldn't believe it. He said she was the fittest person he had on the books.' The couple, who had two children, met when Mr Baldry was studying at Durham University and they attending a student dance together. He said: 'By the time we got down to the bus station she had not stopped talking and I just thought, ""I am going to marry this girl."" 'We did everything together, that was the thing. We went to Japan and India - she had been when she was 18 but had not seen the Taj Mahal. We also went to New Zealand. 'When we were younger we enjoyed going camping on the continent with the kids, we went to Switzerland all the time, we knew it inside out. She also loved the art galleries, she would see four in a morning when we went to London.'","Shirley Baldry, 79, was visiting the Iguazu falls with her daughter .

"By . Richard Spillett . A deaf football team who finished their season on a record low of minus six points have blamed their poor run on not being able to hear the referee's whistle. Birmingham Deaf FC crashed to last place in their division during a catastrophic 2013-14 campaign which saw them lose all but one of their 26 fixtures. After . finishing 21 points behind their nearest rivals at the foot of the division, players have said match officials contributed to their torrid season. Birmingham Deaf FC who slumped to bottom of their local league this season amid complaints they couldn't hear the referee's whistle . The squad - made up mainly of deaf players - said they couldn’t hear the referee’s commands and kept on playing when the game was stopped. They complained that their requests for flags to be used by officials to signal any stoppages were ignored. Club secretary Guy Whieldon, 26, who is himself deaf, said: 'Most lads feel officials are not geared-up for a deaf team due to communication breakdowns, which cause difficulty. 'The referees are supposed to wave flags while, at the same time, blowing a whistle. Most referees forget to wave or simply don’t want to use a flag. 'It was mainly due to poor commitment from our lads as the average age of the team was 22 and our oldest player is 30. 'We wanted to start in division seven and learn, but the AFA decided to put us in division five. Also, we have 36 players on our books.' Birmingham Deaf FC club secretary Guy Whieldon (left) says the players feel officials are not well enough prepared for refereeing their games . The club face relegation to two leagues below their current position after they finished on minus six points . Mr Whieldon added: 'Half came to play and the side was different for every fixture. We played in the Birmingham AFA to raise our standards for deaf fixtures. Currently, I have no idea if we’ll continue in the league, that depends on the lads.' The team's disastrous season saw them on the receiving end of 6-0, 10-0, 9-0, 11-0, 7-0 and 15-0 drubbings. They shipped 164 goals and only scored 27 in one of the worst records in the history of the Birmingham AFA Saturday League. A player from Red Star Galaxy, who beat BDFC 4-2 and 9-3, said his team did feel for the deaf players, who would carry on after the referee's whistle blew. The team also competes in the English Deaf Football North League and cup but say referees in their current league were reluctant to use flags . Opposition players said the deaf team found it hard to hear the referee's stoppages . He added: 'They would just carry on running with the ball whenever their was a stoppage. When the half time whistle blew they knew nothing about it. 'You . had to grab them and point at the ref, it was difficult. They had a few . good players but obviously communication was a big problem - between . each other and the ref.' BDFC, based at Birmingham City University’s pitches, were deducted nine points for failing to turn up for three games. League organisers may now move them down two leagues because of their showing this season. A league official said refereeing with a flag had proved unpopular among . officials and said: 'Three or four did it, but it was not something . that came naturally. They prefer the whistle.' The official added: 'We were told they had three players in the national deaf team, but it soon became apparent they were out of their depth.' The club, set up in 1921, also competes in the English Deaf Football North League and Cup.","Row after Birmingham Deaf FC asked referees to use flag while officiating .

"By . Andrew Levy . An elderly millionaire shot his sick wife dead then turned his shotgun on himself because he was worried about living alone, neighbours said yesterday. Harold Ambrose, 82, rang police to say he had killed his wife Wendy, 77, and was going to take his own life. Officers rushed to the couple’s £1.5million thatched cottage in the village of Boxted, near Colchester, Essex, and found his body in the garden. Crime scene: Harold Ambrose, 82, rang police to say he had killed his wife Wendy, 77, and was going to take his own life at their cottage in Boxted, near Colchester, Essex . Flowers left at the idyllic cottage today by the family for 'Auntie Wendy and Uncle Harold' read 'Rest in Peace' His wife, who had been diagnosed with cancer, had been shot in the head as she sat in a living room chair. Essex Police were continuing investigations last night but said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. A close friend and neighbour, who asked not to be named, said Mr Ambrose, a retired insurance underwriter who had early stage dementia, may have performed a ‘mercy killing’ on his wife and was not prepared to live without her. ‘Mr Ambrose was a classic country gentleman – very traditional and law-abiding,’ he said. ‘We know his wife had suffered from poor health for several years. Recently she had been in and out of hospital with respiratory problems. 'My understanding is that he wanted to end her pain and could not bear to live without her.’ Another neighbour said: ‘They were delightful. They were very dedicated [to each other] and had lived in the cottage all their married life as far as I knew. ‘I got the feeling that if one wasn’t there, the other would not feel complete.’ Shooting: Armed officers were sent to the thatched cottage at around 7am on Saturday where Mr Ambrose was found in the garden and his wife in the lounge chair . Forensic officers carried out investigations at the scene to determine the circumstances surrounding the deaths . Anne Grant, who lives nearby, added: ‘They were pillars of the community. 'They . were really smart and a couple who were very loving and close to one . another. Wendy hadn’t been well and Harold was in the early stages of . dementia.’ Police were contacted by Mr Ambrose early on Saturday morning and discovered the tragic scene shortly afterwards. The road was closed over the weekend for forensic teams to search the area, but the cordon was lifted yesterday. A . post-mortem examination showed Mr Ambrose died from a single shotgun . wound to the face. His wife, a retired secretary, had two head wounds. The road near to the couple's home was sealed off while forensic teams carried out examinations . The couple married in 1956 and had one daughter Clare, who is understood to be disabled and  living in a care home. A bouquet of flowers from family members was leaning against the neat picket fence that surrounds the property yesterday, but relatives were too upset to comment. Detective Chief Inspector Simon Werrett said: ‘I do not believe anyone else was involved in their deaths. Our enquiries will continue and a report will be submitted to the coroner in due course. ‘The house will remain under police control while other searches are ongoing.’ A police spokesman confirmed the shotgun used in the shootings had been licensed to Mr Ambrose.

"By . Emma Glanfield . Inspectors found raw and cooked meat mixed together, filthy surfaces and poorly trained staff when they visited Marco Pierre White’s flagship restaurant in Birmingham, it has emerged. The four-star Marco Pierre White Steakhouse Bar & Grill, which is on the 25th floor of The Cube, was given a zero food hygiene rating from environmental health officers earlier this year. It has now been revealed that inspectors found examples of cross-contamination at the premises including raw and cooked food being stored together and the same equipment being used for both. Marco Pierre White's flagship steakhouse, on the 25th floor of The Cube in Birmingham (pictured), has been given a zero rating by food safety inspectors . A restaurant spokesman has confirmed the rating, but said staff are working with the council to address the issues . According to a document obtained by The Times, the management were ordered to carry out a thorough clean of the surfaces and equipment at the restaurant and train staff on food hygiene and hazard assessment. The steakhouse, which boasts stunning views of Birmingham, opened in December 2011 and meals cost around £50 per head. The abysmal zero rating found the restaurant’s food hygiene and safety to be ‘bad’, while structural compliance was deemed ‘poor’. Officers also stated they had no confidence in the management. The rating relates to either poor standards of hygiene structure, confidence in management or a combination of these factors and now means urgent improvement is necessary. After news of the inspection emerged last week, a Birmingham City Council spokeswoman said: 'Marco Pierre White was informed their Food Standards Agency (FSA) rating would drop and it has been published on the FSA website. 'A certificate and window sticker confirming their zero rating was sent to the restaurant on March 25, 2014.' Despite the bad review, a spokesman . from Marco Pierre White said they have acted on what needed addressing . and continue to work closely with the council. The . spokesman said: 'We can confirm that we received a visit from the . Environmental Health Department of Birmingham City Council earlier this . year. White trained with Albert and Michele Roux at La Gavarouch and Albert once described him as 'my little bunny' 'The feedback was provided in an informal manner by the EHO with some recommendations. 'These were acted on by the management team and subsequent revisits have been very positive. 'We continue to work closely with Birmingham City Council and have appointed a third party food safety consultant to ensure we remain up to date with the rigorous industry regulations and the ongoing changes in legislation and practice.' The zero rating will remain valid, until the date of the next inspection, which could be between six and 18 months’ time. The restaurant can call inspectors . back in the meantime if staff believe standards have improved, but so . far the FSA has not revisited. The Marco Pierre White Steakhouse joins a list of 140 eateries in Birmingham with a zero rating. The . Birmingham City Council spokesman added: 'In Birmingham most food . business operate to a good standard, but if they fall below satisfactory . standards, our officers carry out revisits and take proportionate . enforcement action to ensure that standards are improve. 'Where . premises pose an imminent risk to health - e.g. where there is an . active rodent infestation, severe drainage problems or filthy conditions . - officers will act to close a business down immediately until it has . rectified the problems. 'This . usually only takes a few days to allow the business to bring in proper . systems and carry out necessary treatment and repairs. 'On average, we will take emergency action on about 40 food businesses - from between 3,000 and 4,000 inspections - each year. 'Therefore a very small proportion of serious problems are found in food businesses and the public can be assured these are dealt with quickly.' The news comes after it was revealed Jamie Oliver's upmarket butcher Barbecoa, in the City of London, was forced to close after failing a health inspection. On that occasion food inspectors found mouse droppings, out of date wagyu beef and mouldy cow carcasses. Barbecoa, next to St Paul's Cathedral, was shut down for 24 hours when officers gave it the worst possible hygiene rating - branding it 'hazardous'. Mould was found growing on carcasses in the basement chillers and expensive meats including beef, oxtail, onglet, and Spanish-style pork called lomo de cana. Dirty slicers were also found, as well as old chicken which had been de-boned and vacuum packed to be relabelled with a later use-by date.

"By . Steph Cockroft . Companies could be forced to pay out billions in backdated commission, overtime and bonuses, after a European Union court ruled a worker could still be paid his usual commission while on holiday. The landmark ruling comes after British Gas salesman Mr Z Lock took his employer to an employment tribunal, claiming his commission should be paid on top of his basic salary while he was on annual leave. Now the Court of Justice of the European Union has ruled in Mr Lock's favour, saying the Working Time Directive - under which all EU holiday pay is governed - allows for employees to keep receiving their work-related benefits while on holiday. The Court of Justice of the European Union, pictured, has ruled in favour of Mr Lock, who took his employer British Gas to an employment tribunal over whether he was allowed to be paid commission during his annual leave . Major unions have . welcomed the ruling, saying it will force companies to pay 'proper . salaries' and will mean employees are not short-changed on their pay. But industry experts have warned the ruling could have a huge detrimental effect on businesses - potentially forcing companies across the country to shell out billions in backdated payments. Some warn it could open the floodgates for thousands of claims relating not just to commission but to all employee benefits, such as overtime and bonuses, causing an 'unnecessary increase in uncertainty'. As the directive was introduced in 2008, it is likely claims could potentially date back six years. Tim Thomas, head of employment policy at EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, told MailOnline that a medium-sized company, which on average is made up of about 200 employees, could be forced to pay out £3.3m in backdated payments. Although the full financial impact is not yet known, Mr Thomas said the figure is so high because the Court of Justice could require UK employers to include almost all . elements of pay within the calculation of holiday pay. He said that, on average, businesses . had calculated the ruling, if enforced, would add 4 per cent to their annual payroll. He said: 'For . medium sized and large employers, this will equate to hundreds if not . millions of pounds. 'Employers . who have complied by UK law will be dismayed at the future prospect of . higher wage costs and the potential liability for back-pay, which they . could never have foreseen or prepared for. 'Larger companies . will inevitably look at how they will need to change the organisation of . their businesses, as the court seems minded to include almost all . elements of pay in the holiday pay pot – commission, bonuses and . overtime. 'Smaller companies are likely to have fewer options – for some, there must be a high risk that they will go under.' 'Employers . who have complied by UK law will be dismayed at the future prospect of . higher wage costs and the potential liability for back-pay, which they . could never have foreseen or prepared for' Tim Thomas, head of employment at EEF . Mr Lock first took his employers to a tribunal in Leicester in 2012, which referred the case to the EU court. He asked to be paid his commission between 19 December 2011 and 3 January 2012, when he was on annual leave. According to court papers, Mr Lock said he was losing 60 per cent of his salary because his commission-related earnings were not covered when he went on holiday. He claimed that, because he was unable to generate any new sales or follow up on potential sales while on holiday, this affected the amount he was paid once he returned to work. He argued that, under European law, he was entitled to be compensated for this. The court said Mr Lock had lost out on his usual amount of pay during his holiday at British Gas, which in turn could discourage employees from taking leave . The employment tribunal referred the case to the EU court, asking the Court of Justice of the European Union whether commission-earners could expect payment for potential sales they miss out on while on holiday, in addition to their base salaries. It also asked how this anticipated drop in payment should be calculated. Yesterday, the court passed down a preliminary ruling in Mr Lock’s favour, saying any employee given less pay while on holiday than they would usually earn while working could be deterred from taking annual leave - which itself goes against EU principles. British Gas said it would 'await the outcome' of the employment tribunal to see exactly what impact the ruling would have on its business. The ruling said: 'In today’s judgment, the court points out that, during annual leave, a worker must receive his normal remuneration. 'The purpose of holiday pay is to put the worker, during that period of rest, in a situation which is, as regards his salary, comparable to periods of work.' It continued: 'As British Gas conceded at the hearing, the worker does not generate any commission during the period of his annual leave. 'In the period following that of his annual leave the worker is paid only reduced remuneration comprising his basic salary. That adverse financial impact may deter the worker from actually taking that leave.' 'We will have to look at the full judgment from the CJEU but the ramifications are massive. It is likely millions of workers in the UK have been short changed on their holiday pay' Gary Smith, GMB national officer for energy . Dr Adam Marshall, executive director of policy and external affairs at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the decision was bad news for businesses up and down the country. He said: 'This judgement will cause unnecessary increase in uncertainty for businesses up and down the UK and is likely to give rise to far more disputes between employers and employees, haggling over what the appropriate level of remuneration should be whilst on holiday. 'The existing system was well understood and highly clear for both parties.' Mr Thomas said it would raise the bill for companies across the board. He said: 'In addition to this, there will be further . costs that will arise. 'For example, there will be an increase in the . national insurance contributions payable by the employer and pension . contributions, and some employers will need to change their internal . systems to perform the calculation. 'We are aware of some businesses who . anticipate that they will need to recruit extra staff in order to meet . the administrative requirements.' But UNISON general secretary Dave Prentis said: 'This is an extremely important decision that will assist workers across the European Union to argue that they should be entitled to their normal pay, including any commission payments they normally receive, for periods of annual leave.' And Gary Smith, GMB national officer for energy, said: 'We will have to look at the full judgment from the CJEU but the ramifications are massive. 'Companies who pay commission payments should be using those payments for the purposes of calculating holiday pay. It is likely millions of workers in the UK have been short changed on their holiday pay. 'As you would expect the CBI are warning that this will lead to the roof falling in but this is nonsense. 'Capital's share of annual national income has increased by nearly 50 per cent in a generation. This will put a small dent in that shift and is well affordable. 'The case will now go back to the Employment Tribunal but it is likely millions will be due back pay and will get a big boost to holiday pay in future. 'It is likely to force employers to start paying proper salaries too. There is little incentive now not to pay proper salaries. They are going to have to pay holiday pay on the workers earnings.' The case will now be referred back to . the employment tribunal to determine what annual leave payments Mr Lock . is entitled to under UK law. It will then be left open to the UK government to see how the ruling is put into domestic law. Ralph . Nathan, director of employment law at British Gas, said: 'Many of our . people receive commission as part of doing their job, so we’re reviewing . in detail the CJEU judgment. 'However, . we’ll need to await the outcome of the UK Employment Tribunal’s . decision to understand the precise impact of this European judgment on . UK legislation. 'We’re . already examining the issue raised by the Lock case as part of a wider . review of employee incentives and working with trade union . representatives to help us design our future employee incentive . schemes.'","British Gas salesman Mr Z Lock took his employer to employment tribunal .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Hawwa Khan, who suffered horrific burns, when she fell on to a gas fire at her home in Bradford . A toddler died when she fell into a gas fire after the fireguard fitted in her home 'wasn't suitable', an inquest heard. Hawwa Khan was just 23 months old when she died from multiple organ failure after suffering 60 per cent burns when she climbed on to the guard from a footstool and lost her balance at her home in Bradford, West Yorkshire. The infant had been left unattended for a few seconds when the accident happened in December 2011 and the hearing heard how her clothes ignited as her parents desperately tried to douse the flames. Hawwa was then rushed to hospital in Bradford before being transferred to a specialist burns unit at Manchester Royal Infirmary, where she later died. At an inquest, Hawaa's mother Bushra Kauser said it was obvious the fireguard, provided by a council-run home safety scheme, didn't fit the large raised fireplace in their living room. She said: 'A man came to fit the fireguard about a year before the accident. It was obvious that it wasn't suitable. 'We had been told by the council we were eligible for free home safety measures. Two people came round to inspect our home and sent a man round to fit the fireguard, along with a safety gate, in our home. 'He said the fireplace wasn't completely covered, but that it would do the job. I don't remember being given any documents with instructions on how to use it. 'He just showed me how to hook it to the wall and remove it.' Ms Kauser also recalled how she had popped out of the room at the time of the incident and then ran back in after she heard her daughter screaming. The fireguard was made by the Royal Society of Prevention of Accidents (ROSPA) and fitted by firm Crestra Ltd as part of a family safety measures scheme with the local safeguarding children's board. Glynn Heeney, who fitted the safety device in the house, told the inquest he couldn't recall fitting it in the main living room. He said: 'I vaguely recall suggesting the guard should go in the upstairs bedroom as the fire in the living room was raised off the ground. 'I remember having some sort of disagreement with the father over where the guard should go. Hawaa was taken to hospital in Bradford and was then transferred to a specialist burns unit at the Manchester Royal Infirmary, where she later died . 'If I thought something was unsafe I would always ring my manager, the man who trained me or the office. I would never be persuaded by a persistent customer.' He added: 'I always leave an instruction manual with the client and go through it with them if needs be. This explains that fireguards shouldn't be climbed on and should be used with parental supervision.' The inquest also heard from Trading Standards officer Clare Forbes, who said: 'There are are some Trading Standards diagrams which show fireguards which may fit over larger fires such as this one. This particular guard was the only one available through the Safe at Home scheme. 'It was this fireguard or no fireguard at all. 'If the manner in which it is fitted was found to be in breach, the remedy arising from that could be that we take over criminal prosecution with the distributor for causing the fireguard to be unsafe. 'That wasn't done in this case.' Summing up assistant coroner Oliver Longstaff gave an accidental ruling. He said: 'These events are events from which no one ever truly recovers. It's only human to cast around to think what could have been done differently. 'There is an irony in the likelihood with how Hawwa came to contact with the fire by the fireguard that was there to protect her. The fireplace where the incident happened with a fireguard, similar to the one which was fitted . 'Various hypotheses have been brought forward. It's unlikely that Hawwa fell directly into the fire, if so she would not have got out and onto the other side of the fireguard. 'It's also unlikely she climbed over the guard, it was 60cm and she was only a metre tall.' He said Hawwa's death, on the balance of probabilities, was more to do with the placing of the footstool she used to climb onto the fireguard. 'My conclusion is that wherever [the fireguard] was fitted, the crucial thing was not its presence but the presence next to it of the adjacent piece of furniture,' the assistant coroner added. 'I find it impossible to resolve disputes about whether the fireguard was fitted in the lounge or elsewhere. Both have been given support in the evidence given by people all trying to do their best to prevent any tragedy. 'It is every parent's nightmare to turn away for a few seconds and to have a disaster occur. This was a tragic accident and it is impossible to think of words to say.' Speaking after the inquest, Hawwa's father Saeed Khan said: 'We have since had two more children and this has given us solace and helped us move on a bit. We've put everything behind us now.'","Hawwa Khan died after suffering 60 per cent burns at her home in Bradford .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Senior Labour MPs rounded on Ed Miliband today - as election experts warned the party was no longer on track to win the next general election. While the party made significant progress in London it struggled elsewhere as anti-government protest votes went to Ukip. One of the country's top polling experts Professor John Curtice said Labour had lost up to nine per cent support since the last local elections two years ago. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the party's performance was 'not good enough yet'. He added: 'We have got more to do if we are really going to win the argument.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Shsadow Chancellor Ed Balls, on the campaign trail in the Vale of Glamorgan this week, admitted Labour's performance in the council elections had not been good enough . Ed Miliband defended Labour's performance to journalists outside his house in North London this morning . WINS: Hammersmith & Fulham and Croydon are big wins, suggesting Labour has strength in London. Won Cambridge after taking seats from Lib Dems. Retained control of Harlow Council, despite losing three seats to UKIP. LOSSES: Failing to win Swindon is a setback, while losing control of Thurrock suggests the party may struggle to win key swing seats at the next election. In the party's heartland of Rotherham, UKIP took 10 of the 21 seats being contested. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls admitted Labour's performance had been poor. Mr Balls said: 'It's not good enough yet for Labour. We have got more to do if we are really going to win the argument.' The Labour heavyweight said: 'We’re doing better than people were expecting across southern seats but now the challenge is for Labour in the north - particularly where we’re clearly the majority party or tight Tory/Labour areas. We have to understand that challenge.' He added that 'everyone is taken aback on gains across the country'. Felow Labour MP John Mann hit out at the Labour leadership for failing to take on UKIP. He said: 'The Labour party and the people deciding strategy at the top, without question, and they told me this, had a strategy of ignoring UKIP instead of taking them on. And that was a disastrous strategy. 'What the party should have done in this election is take on UKIP. 'But the Labour party needs to have a broader appeal. People like me and the views that I represent.. our viewpoint is not sufficiently being heard within the Labour party. 'The coalition of the Labour party is not broad enough and we need to be part of it and if we're not Labour won't win at the next general election.' He blasted 'pointy-heads' at the top of the party for ignoring working class concerns. Mr Mann accused Mr Miliband of not 'broadening the appeal' of the party. Outspoken Labour MP Simon Danczuk admitted voters were being turned off by Mr Miliband. He said: 'I’m not going to pretend that Ed Miliband as an issue doesn’t come up on the doorstep, of course it does.' Graham Stringer agreed that the public were not buying into the prospect of Mr Miliband being Prime Minister. Mr Stringer added: 'These wasn’t the kind of enthusiasm on the doorstep that I have felt when we have been going to win elections. 'And when you talk more deeply to people, they don’t really find an empathy or sympathy with Ed. He’s not getting over his own personality over to them in a way they feel warm towards.' Mr Stringer was asked if he was worried by the results. He said: 'Yes.' The Labour MP added: 'Ed Miliband has just said the general election campaign starts here. Well, I am afraid, really, the general election campaign started at the start of this campaign, and we have not done as well as we should have done.' He attacked the Labour leadership's refusal to grant the public a referendum on Europe and slammed Mr Miliband for his blundering TV performace this week in which he failed to know how much he spent on his shopping. 'The centrepiece of our campaign has been the cost of living, and yet Ed didn’t know his own cost of living when he went into it, he didn’t know how much he was spending on shopping. 'Really, people around him should have said when David Cameron had been attacked as a posh boy not knowing the price of milk that we should not fall into that trap. We should know the price of milk and bread. That sort of thing is unforgivably unprofessional.' The Labour leader said the party was making gains in key battleground seats - including in London and the south East. But he faced criticism from within his own party for not doing better . Professor John Curtice said the public did not seem to see Labour as a alternative Government. He said: 'When it comes to local elections, we have quite high expectations of what oppositions should achieve. 'We basically say, if a party looks as though it is potentially regarded as an alternative government, it should be doing very well in local elections, even better than you would expect to do in a general election in 12 months' time. 'The truth is, by that test at least, Labour have not done well enough. 'Most of the seats that were being up for grabs yesterday were last fought over on the same day as the 2010 general election. 'And if you compare Labour's performance vote-for-vote with 2010, the advance is just 3 percentage points - 3 per cent on what was the day in which Labour recorded its second worst result. 'And if you actually compare these results with the position two years ago, which we can also compare most of these places with, Labour's vote is clearly well down, something like nine points. 'When you talk more deeply to people, they don’t really find an empathy or sympathy with Ed' 'So the truth is, modest progress, Labour not even doing as well as they were able to do earlier in this parliament, and thereby again reinforcing the doubts that have always been there that at the end of the day it is not entirely clear that the British electorate regard Labour as a clear alternative.' Former Labour Cabinet minister Peter Hain yesterday warned the party was losing working class votes – and warned Mr Miliband to adopt a more ‘robust’ approach to Ukip. ‘The problem is that there is a seriously alienated – mostly white working class, often male – vote out there that was traditionally Labour’s,’ he said. One senior Labour figure told The Times: ‘The truth is that Miliband looks weird, sounds weird, is weird.’ Labour shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna attempted to play down the emergence of Ukip, saying support for the party represented ‘discontent with the entire political system’. But he added: ‘Undoubtedly we’re in an era of four party politics. Former minister David Lammy said the party should have done better in places such as Swindon, conceding that voters were 'swallowing' Ukip's message on immigration and Europe. But Labour election boss Douglas Alexander insisted Labour could win the general election based on the results coming in overnight from key battleground seats. The party has seized control in Hammersmith and Fulham, previously a flagship Tory authority, and is expecting positive results in Merton and Croydon. 'Ed Miliband is not on course to win the next election', claimed Tory MPJackie Doyle-Price after the results started trickling through this morning. Many Labour MPs are concerned that Mr Miliband is seen as too 'weird' to win . He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: 'I think there is not just a whole group of people who feel left behind by the economy but locked out of politics. 'There is a deep anger and alienation there and the votes that we have seen for Ukip overnight are in part a reflection of that reality. 'The challenge is how does a party like the Labour party seek to respond? And I don’t think simply politics as usual is an adequate response to trends that didn’t build up in the last few days, but actually have been building up over decades.'","LATEST: Labour have 1,812 seats, up 288.

"By . Leon Watson . Paedophile: Stuart Hall, pictured when he was first charged in late 2012. Today, his niece has revealed she was one of his victims . A niece of disgraced broadcaster Stuart Hall has revealed he had sex with her when she was 14 after taking advantage of her 'dysfunctional' family life. The . mother-of-three, now 52, told how the abuse started when she started going with her uncle to the BBC in Manchester on work experience. Hall - who was also her godfather - plied . her with alcohol before abusing her in his dressing room at the corporation's studios in Oxford Road. 'He makes me sick,' she told The Sun. 'The abuse started when I was 14. He seemed to single me out. I would go to the BBC every week for about 18 months and he would sleep with me almost every time. 'He would get me drunk and have sex with me. Then he would drop me home and come in to see my mum. He even said to my dad once, ""Oh don't worry about the girls, I'm looking after them"".' The niece, who is now a housing worker living in Derbyshire, said after her parents broke up she was banned from seeing her father's family - except Hall. She added that from the age of 10 she was aware that he was 'very touchy-feely',  The Sun reported. Hall was sentenced on Friday to another two years and six months in prison for indecently assaulting an under-age girl. But a judge has told him he would have received a 'considerably greater' sentence if he had been prosecuted under current laws. The former It's A Knockout presenter was cleared last week of 15 counts of rape in relation to two women - one of whom was his niece - who claimed they were sexually assaulted by him between 1976 and 1981. The 84-year-old was convicted by the jury at Preston Crown Court of indecently assaulting one of the complainants when she was under the age of 16, and had earlier pleaded guilty to another indecent assault on the same girl when she was 13. The charge Hall admitted involved an incident at a dinner party where he crept into his victim’s bedroom and assaulted her. The married father-of-two is currently serving a 30-month jail term after he pleaded guilty last year to indecently assaulting 13 other young girls, aged between nine and 17, over a 20-year period. Stuart Hall (centre) became famous in the 1970s when he presented hit TV show It's A Knockout . The ex-BBC Radio 5 Live football match commentator had not been due for release from that custodial sentence until September. Hall . will not now be eligible for release until December 2015 as today’s . sentence will only begin after the end of his current jail term. Passing sentence, Lord Justice Turner said of his offences: 'It was an act of vile bravado and horrible betrayal.' Hall, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and striped tie, was excused from standing as sentence was passed. The judge said one of the aggravating factors of the offences against the victim was Hall’s initial public denials of guilt. He added: 'Your lack of remorse evinced in your prepared statement to the police in which you expressed surprise against all the allegations against you when you knew you had molested her.' Hall, pictured outside court for a previous hearing, will now not be eligible for release until December 2015 . Hall was . sentenced to 12 months for the offence he admitted and was given an . additional 18 months for the indecent assault of which he was convicted . by the jury. He will serve half of the new sentence in custody before he is released on licence. The . judge said that, had Hall committed the dinner party offence in more . recent years, his conduct would have been classed as assault by . penetration. It is understood that in Hall's circumstances that would have led to a minimum eight-year jail term. Addressing Hall, Mr Justice Turner said: 'You volunteered to help clean them up. Your real intentions, however, were far darker. 'You saw their condition not as a cause for concern but as an ideal opportunity to carry out acts of gross sexual molestation on the two girls while they were at least partly incapacitated by drink.' He went into the girl's bedroom and sexually assaulted her, the court heard. 'He would get me drunk and have sex with me. Then he would drop me home and come in to see my mum' Stuart Hall's niece . 'She woke up during this ordeal and you continued until at one point you tried to get on top of her,' he said. 'Eventually . you desisted and left the room. As if this behaviour were not grotesque . enough, on the same evening you molested your victim's friend in the . very same way while purporting to give her a bath. 'The . vileness of your conduct on that evening would be difficult to . exaggerate. The element of breach of trust was of the utmost gravity. 'Your . victim was well below the age of consent. You carried out your . depredations under the roof of her parents and under the camouflage of . synthetic concern for the welfare of children. 'You repaid your friends' hospitality by cynically defiling their daughter.' The judge said Hall could have 'wiped the slate clean' last summer by admitting this offence earlier. He told him: 'You therefore denied yourself the freedom from subsequent prosecution and punishment which a full confession would have given you. To this extent, you are therefore the author of your present situation.' He went on: 'I take the view that the fact that you molested two girls in such quick succession sheds an even more sinister light on your offending than was evidenced by the one related offence to which you pleaded guilty last year. 'It is difficult to resist the conclusion that it must have been with a sense of arrogant and contemptible immunity that you defiled each of these young girls, one in the immediate wake of another.' Hall, from . Wilmslow, Cheshire, did not give evidence at his trial but his defence . team did not dispute that he had sexual intercourse with both . complainants. Apart . from one occasion when Hall said an alleged rape of one of the girls . when she was aged 12 did not take place, his counsel argued the . intercourse - when they were were in their mid-teens and he was in his . mid-40s - was consensual and that he was not a rapist. Earlier, Crispin Aylett QC, mitigating, said Hall was a man in his 80s who had been brought to account for offences committed more than 30 years ago and had now faced three separate sets of proceedings. Mr Aylett continued: 'That would have been intolerable for anyone but for a man of 84, facing the prospect of dying in prison, the burden can scarcely be imagined.' 'He's been punished, he's been disgraced and for what it's worth, he's been financially ruined and I say on his behalf, enough is enough.'","Mother-of-three reveals he took advantage of her 'dysfunctional family'

"By . Tara Brady . Paul Oddysses vanished from Hollesley Bay on the Suffolk coast on Saturday sparking a major police search . A dangerous robber serving a life sentence is being hunted by police after he escaped from an open jail. Paul Oddysses, who was jailed for armed robbery, vanished from Hollesley Bay on the Suffolk coast on Saturday sparking a major police search. Officers have warned that the 49-year-old should not be approached if any member of the public sees him. Oddysses, who has connections in Essex and Hertfordshire, also has tattoos on both arms and a scar on the back of his head. Hollesley Bay is a category D jail which on an 85-acre site which houses 420 inmates over the age of 18, many serving long terms of imprisonment for serious crimes. More than 100 prisoners are allowed out of the prison on a daily basis to work in the community but police say Oddysses was not permitted to leave the jail. Oddysses is described a white man who is 5ft 6ins tall, clean shaven and thin. His disappearance follows a string of high-profile escapes from prisons in recent weeks. Police are still looking for convict Charlie Casey, 22, who walked out of Sudbury prison in Derbyshire on April 30 where he was serving a sentence for a £365,000 fraud. Police believe the drug addict has since attacked a woman in Dorset leaving her with serious stab wounds. Last week Anthony Peloe, 43, who was serving an indeterminate sentence for possessing firearms with intent to cause harm, and convicted robber John Arnold, 30, absconded from Thorn Cross open prison. Prison officials at the jail in Warrington, Cheshire, discovered the pair were missing at about 10.30am on May 20 and alerted Cheshire Police who launched a manhunt for the inmates. Paul Oddysses vanished from Hollesley Bay on the Suffolk coast on Saturday sparking a major police search . Arnold was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence carrying a minimum term of two years after being convicted of robbery in May 2006. Peloe was convicted of possession of firearms with intent to commit harm in December 2005. He was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence with a minimum tariff of three years. Following the string of prisoners escaping jail the government has ordered changes to stop convicts with a history of absconding not being held in an open prison. The government ordered immediate changes after knife robber Damien Burns, 39, and convicted thief Dean Jackson, 27, fled from a Category D prison in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. They walked out on Monday night – just a fortnight after Michael ‘Skull Cracker’ Wheatley fled from an open prison in Kent, before being caught four days later. On the run: Anthony Peloe (left), 43, and John Arnold (right), 30, both absconded from jail yesterday morning . It is the latest in a series of escapes that has heaped embarrassment on ministers and prompted critics to brand the prison service ‘beyond a joke’. Burns was serving an indeterminate sentence, since 2007, for a knifepoint robbery and Jackson was on remand awaiting a sentence for a theft related matter. Their escape came just a day after a murderer who absconded from an open prison was arrested after going on the run for the fourth time. Arnold Pickering, 44, who stabbed a blind man to death, was held for being unlawfully at large at an address in Oldham. The killer was recaptured by Greater Manchester Police after failing to return to jail on Saturday afternoon. Other escapees: Damien Burns, 39, (left) originally from . Scarborough, North Yorkshire, and Dean Jackson (right), 27, from . Newcastle-upon-Tyne, failed to return to the open prison HMP & YOI . Hatfield in Doncaster . Thomas Moffett, a violent thief and fellow inmate with Nazi tattoos who was also on temporary licence, also absconded on the same day from the same prison. Moffett was arrested and is also being held in custody. MPs have attacked the 'absolute scandal' of murderers being allowed out of prison 'willy nilly'. In 1991, a judge said Pickering appointed himself as an ‘executioner’ when he decided to kill 53-year-old Thomas Leigh, who was wrongly thought to be a paedophile. He was serving 18 years for that murder when he went missing on Saturday. His three previous escapes have been from Strangeways in Manchester and open prisons in Lancashire and Sussex. Recent cases: Murderer Arnold Pickering (left), who stabbed a blind man . to death, was arrested earlier this week after going on the run from . jail. Another inmate, Thomas Moffett (right), 51, also . failed to return from day release but was arrested for . being unlawfully at large . Pickering and Moffett, 51, had been allowed out from HMP Kennet – an open category C prison in Maghull, Merseyside – at 9.30am on Saturday. They failed to return as agreed at 4.30pm. Moffett, who has swastika tattoos on his arms, was jailed for seven years in 2006 for a two-month spree of ‘professionally executed robberies’. He threatened shop workers with a nail gun in a series of raids on off-licences in Blackburn. He was caught after an employee slipped an explosive dye pack into a bundle of cash. Armed robber Michael Wheatley, AKA the Skull Cracker, went on the run for four days after absconding from open prison . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said last week: 'Keeping the public safe is our priority and I will not allow the actions of a small minority of offenders [to] undermine public confidence in the prison system . 'Absconds have reached record lows under this Government but I take each and every incident seriously. 'I have already ordered immediate changes to tighten up the system as a matter of urgency. 'With immediate effect, prisoners will no longer be transferred to open conditions or allowed out on temporary release if they have previously absconded, and there will also be no unrestricted ""town leave' . 'I am clear that open prisons and temporary licence remains an important tool in rehabilitating long term offenders but not at the expense of public safety.' Ian McLoughlin was convicted of murdering Graham Buck while on day release . The day release programme is designed to help prisoners settle back into ordinary life towards the end of their sentence by allowing them to attend work or training. But it has come under fierce attack for leaving the public at risk from unreformed, dangerous criminals. The government has admitted that more than 1,600 criminals were granted day release last year. Triple killer Ian McLoughlin last year murdered a man while on day release from prison. Last July, Ian McLoughlin was convicted of murdering Graham Buck in the village of Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, while on day release. Murderer Joseph Williams carried out 11 armed raids on bookmakers after being handed a release pass in 2010. And Mark Neville, a drug dealer, spent his day out of prison in 2008 overseeing a £14million cocaine deal. Earlier this month it was revealed more than 400 killers were kept in open prisons, which have minimal supervision.","Paul Oddysses vanished from Hollesley Bay on the Suffolk coast .

"By . Darren Boyle . An elderly woman escaped injury after she accidentally reversed through the front window of a busy supermarket. The woman ploughed through the front of the Waitrose supermarket in York shortly before 5pm yesterday. The red Ford Fiesta mounted the curb and smashed through two plate glass windows before coming to a rest in the store's lobby. Shoppers and staff at the Waitrose store in York fled in terror as the Ford Fiesta, pictured, ploughed through the front window of the supermarket . The elderly female motorist misjudged her speed while manoeuvring in the supermarket car park, stamping on the car's throttle instead of the brake . Staff and customers were forced to flee as shattered glass was thrown into to the store towards the tills. One member of staff is understood to have suffered some minor cuts and bruises. North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue attended the scene and assisted the elderly lady who escaped without injury. One eyewitness who had just completed her weekly shop and was waiting for a cup of coffee said she spotted the car as it careered through the window with an almighty bang. 'Then an absolutely excellent young man - a customer - took control of the situation. I don't know who he was but he was reassuring the driver and keeping her calm.' One female member of staff suffered minor cuts and bruises as a result of the incident. A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue confirmed they had been called out to the incident at 16.41 on Saturday. 'Fire appliances from York and Acomb . and a heavy rescue unit from Tadcaster have dealt with a single vehicle . traffic collision at Waitrose in York. 'It . would appear that a Ford Fiesta was accidentally driven through the . shop frontage and came to rest inside the store with various fittings . and debris around it. 'The . elderly female driver was assisted from the vehicle by fire crews and . received a check up by paramedics on the scene but appeared uninjured. 'A . female member of staff in the store received minor cuts and bruises and . suffered shock. Fire crews assisted in making the scene safe and left it in the hands of Police.' A Waitrose spokesman said: 'Thankfully nobody was seriously injured and we're very grateful to the emergency services for their prompt and expert response.' North Yorkshire police attended the scene and are investigating the cause of the accident.","The elderly woman lost control of her vehicle in the supermarket's car park .

As part of the coalition's drive to reduce the Army from 102,000 regulars . to just 82,000, the 16 Air Assault Brigade will be stripped of half of its regular infantry battalions. The brigade, which is the Army's rapid response airborne formation and encompasses the Parachute Regiment battalions, will also lose air power, artillery and armoured vehicles. Threat: Britain's elite airborne force 16 Air Assault Brigade, pictured on an exercise in Scotland in 2012, is to be cut by a third as the government slashes Armed Forces jobs . March: Soldiers from 16 Air Assault Brigade march toward the Houses of Parliament during a homecoming parade in 2011. The brigade has served in each of the Army's recent deployments to Sierra Leone, Macedonia, Iraq and Afghanistan . Sources within the brigade - the largest in the British Army - estimate that it will have lost almost 3,000 of its 8,000 personnel by the end of December. The changes were first outlined in 2013 following the Army 2020 study, which revealed how the government intended to make the Army 'smaller, integrated and more adaptable'. It is hoped that the cuts will shave £10billion from the Ministry of Defence budget, although there have been concerns over the reduction in numbers in the face of any potential future conflicts. Details of the cuts to 16 . Air Assault Brigade, and the timescale in which they will be implemented, have now emerged in an issue of the Parachute Regiment’s journal and in an internal . briefing. By the end of the year infantry units the 1st and 2nd Battalions the Royal Irish Regiment will leave the brigade, which has served in each of the Army's recent deployments to Sierra Leone, Macedonia, Iraq and Afghanistan, for a lower readiness force, according to the Sunday Telegraph. Changes: By the end of the year infantry units the 1st and 2nd Battalions the Royal Irish Regiment will leave the brigade for a lower readiness force . Fifth Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland, which had been part of . the brigade, has been disbanded apart from a single public duties company. Armoured . reconnaissance vehicles from the Household Cavalry . Regiment, where Prince Harry is an officer, are also being reassigned . and the brigade, based in Colchester, Essex,  is set to lose artillery, . engineers and helicopters. Former Parachute Regiment officer and Labour MP, Dan . Jarvis, said the cuts were 'baffling'. 'The . drawdown in Afghanistan means our focus now pivots towards contingency . operations with 16 Air Assault set to play a lead role within that,' he told the Sunday Telegraph. 'It’s . therefore baffling why, just at the point where we start to focus on . contingency operations, cuts are being made that will undermine the . deployability and combat effectiveness of the brigade.' As part of the Army 2020 programme, it is hoped that the shortfall caused by the loss of 20,000 regulars will be made up by a newly renamed Army Reserve, formerly the . Territorial Army. Questioning: Former Parachute Regiment officer and Labour MP, Dan Jarvis, said the cuts were 'baffling' The Navy will lose 5,500 . sailors and the Royal Air Force is to be cut by 8,000. There have been four tranches of redundancies, although the most recent, announced in January is expected to be the final round. Battalions earmarked to be disbanded in the July 2012 study are now in the process of winding up, and some have already been absorbed into other regiments. Plans to disband the 2nd Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers was met with protests from former soldiers, who marched on parliament in an attempt to save the battalion - of which Drummer Lee Rigby was a member. However, this summer the regiment's 1st and 2nd Battalions will merge to form the new First . Fusiliers, with the second battalion removed from the Army's order of . battle on August 31. Earlier this month MPs warned that the armed forces could face further cuts because of a £1.2million underspend by the MoD. In . December last year, General Sir Nick Houghton, Chief of the Defence . Staff, said there was a huge danger Britain would have too much . state-of-the-art equipment but not enough troops to man it. In . a damning assessment of government plans, he said: 'Our current course . leads to a strategically incoherent force structure - exquisite . equipment, but insufficient resources to man that equipment or train. It . is what the Americans call the spectre of the ""hollow force"".' Yesterday serving Navy Vice Admiral Simon Lister launched a scathing . attack on the state of the Royal Navy, claiming it has been reduced to a . collection of broken-down ships and ageing submarines whose crews are . demoralised and poorly trained. Writing . in a military journal, he said: ‘The price of unrelenting operational . tempo is unsustainable pressure on engineers as every opportunity for . maintenance is squeezed out of busy programmes. ‘For example, the lack of operators trained to stream and recover Type 23 towed sonar. ‘Overall . material readiness continues to decline. From the submarine . perspective, the numbers of force elements at readiness have been driven . low by late delivery of Astute [a new model of submarine] and platform . ageing. ‘Support is increasingly over-reliant on [civilians] for repair. This philosophy builds in declining competence and confidence.’ Colonel . Tim Collins of 1st Battalion Royal Irish Regiment, part of 16 Air . Assault Brigade during the war in Iraq, said: 'The Army is now of a size where it’s hard to call it an army. It’s more of a defence force.' An Army spokesman told MailOnline: 'Difficult decisions were taken in the 2010 SDSR to ensure we can properly equip the Army for the future. 'Changes to the structure and size of 16 Air Assault Brigade were announced in 2013 and implemented as part of wider changes that will ensure the Army is more flexible and better able to meet future threats. 'It will remain the Army’s premier high readiness formation and will be able to draw on support from other divisions and support units should this be required. 'This is at the heart of creating a more adaptable force and will have no impact on our operational effectiveness.'","16 Air Assault Brigade stripped of half of its regular infantry battalions .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Reconciliation: Natasha Gascoine has taken back rugby star husband Andy Powell back and the couple are expecting a baby . Rugby star Andy Powell is back with the wife who spray painted 'cheat' across his car and house as she reveals she is carrying his baby and says 'we still love each other'. Natasha Gascoine branded the Wales and former British Lions player a 'liar, cheat and a scumbag' when their marriage failed after just nine months amid allegations he had cheated on her. She also posted screengrabs of his sexually explicit texts to her on Twitter, and put the 32-year-old's rugby gear for sale on eBay, along with her wedding dress. However, Ms Gascoine, 25, today confirmed that after . three miscarriages she is pregnant again, and Powell is the father. The pair started divorce proceedings in March and Ms Gascoine told friends they were ending their brief marriage amicably. But it became very amicable - the pair kissed and made up and told their family and friends they still have a future together. 'Andy was ringing me and texting me and I ignored it but a a few weeks after we thought: ""We'll put everything behind us and move forward"",' she said. 'He said he didn't want us to get divorced - and we still love each other, there is no doubt about that. 'It took me a while to accept because I was still really angry. 'He said he would do various things to make it up to me and we'd get back on track and see each other here and there and now I'm pregnant again.' Today the couple marked their first wedding anniversary at the Celtic Manor golf resort in Newport where the held their reception a year ago. 'We have spent most of the year living apart so it hasn't been much of a marriage,' she said. 'But we are both determined to give it another go - we have to forget about some of the things we did and said to each other and move on.' After returning from a holiday to Dubai with a female friend, Ms Gascoine announced she is pregnant for the fourth time in just over a year. She tweeted at the weekend: 'Coming back from Dubai & I have found out I'm pregnant for the fourth time in almost a year,"" she wrote on Twitter, posting a photograph of her positive pregnancy test. 'Soo . nervous :( really wish I could be excited and calm about it. Trying not . to build up my hopes but also to avoid thinking the worse possible . scenario :( . 'Fingers crossed . and God's luck everything turns out ok. I got to 17 weeks last time... 6 . weeks second and very early few weeks first time. Extremely nervous :( . xxxxx.' Anger: Ms Gascoine branded the Wales player a 'liar, cheat and a scumbag' when their marriage failed after just nine months amid allegations he had cheated on her . Update: Ms Gascoine took to Twitter to reveal that she was pregnant with Powell's baby . Just two months ago the pair were in the middle of a very public break-up over Powell's alleged infidelity, drinking and gambling. Ms Gascoine was 17 weeks pregnant at the time and was devastated when she lost the baby at the beginning of April, even though she and Powell had split. The pair had argued very publicly via Twitter, and the row included 6ft 4in Powell bizarrely posting a naked picture of himself. She then sprayed the words 'scumbag' and cheat over his house and pink Mercedes, and even went onto eBay to sell her £10,000 engagement ring, wedding ring, jewellery, dress and the gifts the pair received on the big day. She wrote on the auction website: 'The sentimental value has gone and to be honest. 'Since being married to him I have realised how fake he really is. And what a great let down he has been.' Office . worker Ms Gascoine gave the proceeds of her clear out to Women's Aid . and Samaritans - charities she describes as ""close to her heart"". She . said at the time: 'I don't think Andy Powell knows who he really is, . he's built a character to fool everyone who knows him and I fell for it. 'I . wouldn't want anyone else going through what I have been through, I've . been holding up my wedding dress, thinking of the future we had planned - . destroyed.' Split: During their public break up the pair, who married last May (right) argued on Twitter, with Powell posting this naked photograph (left) Back row forward Powell responded by saying he hated her and 'could never forgive her'. Powell played for the . Cardiff Blues, Wasps and Sale Sharks during his rugby career, before . crossing codes to play rugby league for the Wigan Warriors. But his move ended after just five games for Wigan when he picked up a neck injury, and he was released by the club in January. He won 23 caps for Wales, and toured South Africa with the British and Irish Lions in 2009. But he was also known for his off-field problems. In 2011 was suspended after getting embroiled in a bar brawl with football fans. In 2010 he was banned from driving for 15 months and fined £1,000 for driving the . stolen cart along the hard shoulder of the M4 to 'get some munchies' from a service station at 5.30 in the morning. Powell moved back in with his parents in his home town of Brecon, Powys, after the break-up and Ms Gascoine revealed they are still not living together. For sale: Ms Gascoine went onto eBay to sell his rugby gear, as well as her £10,000 engagement ring, wedding ring, jewellery and dress . She is staying with her parents at their country home in Monmouthshire while Powell gets his life back on track. 'He is still drinking but he has given up gambling which is an improvement,' she said. 'But he chose to go on a golfing holiday with his mates rather than come to Dubai with me. 'He's able to go on trips while I'm at home stressing and worried and feeling really anxious. I'm just hanging onto his word all the time. 'Unless he was to get his career back on track, or some kind of job, I think he's always going to be distracted. He knows a lot of people, he likes to socialise.' Powell and Ms Gascoine are due to have the first scan of their baby later this week. She said: 'We are both excited but I am very worried. I have lost the previous three, I don't want it to happen again.' Ms Gascoine admitted she still has 'trust issues' with Powell but insists he has never been attracted to rugby groupies throwing themselves at him. 'I have heard from a few good friends that he's had women sitting on his lap and he's been pushing them away,' she said. 'He'll even leave a club, because he's never liked women pestering him. 'If he was to react back on that and I found out about that then obviously I would be concerned.' Powell was unavailable to comment on getting back with his wife yesterday.","Natasha Gascoine branded sportsman a 'scumbag' when marriage failed .

"By . Brian Marjoribanks . Axed former Hibs skipper James McPake insists Terry Butcher should not escape the blame for the club’s humiliating relegation. Butcher is under intense pressure after Sunday’s defeat to Hamilton but kick-started a major cull of his playing squad with 14 players shipped out of Easter Road just 24 hours later. The former England captain spent the day encamped at the club’s Tranent training base as he broke the news to players in a series of face-to-face meetings. Speaking out: Axed Hibs skipper James McPake says Terry Butcher must accept some blame . McPake and fellow former skipper Kevin Thomson were among 10 players not offered new contracts, alongside Ben Williams, Alan Maybury, Paul Cairney and Tom Taiwo. Sean Murdoch, Paul Grant, Bradley Donaldson, David Gold and Dean Horribine were also jettisoned, while loan players Daniel Boateng, Danny Haynes and Duncan Whatmore were told to return to their parent clubs. Sportsmail understands current captain Liam Craig has been told Hibs won’t stand in his way if he can find a new club and it’s believed several other under-contract players have been told to take ‘substantial’ wage cuts or find another club. As he made his way to the exit on Monday, a clearly devastated McPake insisted it would be wrong to conclude that Hibs’ first relegation since 1998 was solely down to the players. Clearing the decks: Terry Butcher showed the door to 14 players following relegation . ‘It’s probably going to be coming out that it’s all the players’ fault – but you can’t blame it all on the players,’ said the 29-year-old. ‘There’s no way it’s entirely the players’ fault; the players had got the club to two Scottish Cup Finals. Admittedly, we got beat in the two cup finals but we got them there and we finished quite comfortably in the league last season. ‘So, yes, blame lies with the players. We got the club relegated – but you can’ t entirely just look at the players. ‘The manager said he is looking for radical change but I don’t know what he means by that. If he means the players I’m not too sure the squad’s as bad as him saying that but that’s his opinion and that’s why he’s the manager and I’m not. Surplus to requirements: Brad Donaldson and Tom Taiwo were among 10 players shown the door . ‘The players backed the manager and wanted to win every game. Before you back a manager you’re going out for personal pride and your family, you’re doing it for them before the manager. ‘There’s no way anybody in that squad wanted that club to be relegated. I saw 20 grown men in tears. There’s a lot of Hibernian fans in that dressing room as well.’ McPake was also critical of Butcher’s decision to throw kids like Alex Harris, Jason Cummings and Sam Stanton into the pressurised play-offs. Cummings missed the vital penalty to send Hibs down while Harris was humiliatingly replaced after coming on as a substitute. Dejected: Hibs were relegated after their heartbreaking play-off defeat to Hamilton . ‘I feel sorry for Cummings, Harris and Sam Stanton. There was enough experience in the dressing room. That did not have to happen,’ he said. McPake, who last played in October and missed a large chunk of the season with a back injury, insists he was fully fit for the last ten weeks of the season but was ignored by Butcher. And he said: ‘I’m gutted that I’ve not been on the pitch to help. I’ve been training and been fully available for the past 10 weeks. I do believe I could have helped the team out. I’ve been desperate to help them out. ‘The manager just said he believed I wasn’t fit enough. That’s his opinion, but it’s not an opinion I agree with. Thrown in at the deep end: Jason Cummings' penalty miss proved costly . 'I believe I was more than capable of playing and I’ll stand by that. I had the operation in December. There were no complications with my rehab and I’ve felt as good as I have in the past two years. ‘100 per cent I could have contributed. I’m not saying I would definitely have made a difference – but I was fit enough. ‘I’m gutted to be leaving Hibs. I loved playing for this football club. I had some good times and I had some very bad times too. But I’m most disappointed that I didn’t get the chance to help this club stay in the Premiership. ‘Sunday was a devastating day for everyone but we had enough chances to save ourselves.’","Axed skipper insists boss was also at fault as Hibs lost SPL status .

And the White Hart Lane club are growing increasingly confident they can announce Pochettino as Tim Sherwood's replacement by the end of week. Spurs have privately expressed to Southampton their interest in the Argentine and work towards appointing the manager has been ongoing behind the scenes for a fortnight. Is that the way to White Hart Lane? Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino looks set for Tottenham . Turmoil: Spurs have endured a difficult season which culminated in the sacking of Tim Sherwood . Talks are at an advanced stage, and barring a last-minute collapse in the deal, Pochettino should be installed as new White Hart Lane chief in the coming days. Sportsmail revealed Tottenham's intention to approach Pochettino on March 7. However, the 42-year-old has been forced to fend off competition from Ajax boss Frank de Boer, who made a late rally for the post last week. Pochettino has forged a reputation as one of the country's most-promising managers since his arrival in 2013. And he is now set to be handed the task of firing Tottenham back into the Champions League. De Boer's hopes had been been raised again despite his controversial outburst following his fourth successive Eredivisie triumph with Ajax. The Dutchman was openly critical of Tottenham's handling of their recruitment process when he discovered he was among a number of candidates. De Boer has the pedigree after a phenomenal start to his managerial career in Holland and has also worked with Spurs' star midfielder Christian Eriksen.

He has been involved in a series of talks with Saints aimed at keeping him at St Mary's, but he has yet to make a decision. Levy, coming under increasing pressure to make an appointment, is ready to make his final move within the next two days. Tottenham had also spoken to former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini about the job but the Italian is not now a contender. Mancini is currently in Turkey with Galatasaray and has just finished his first season in Istanbul by winning the domestic cup. The 49-year-old is looking for a return to the Barclays Premier League and was very keen on the job at White Hart Lane.

"By . Paul Hirst, Press Association . Daniel Sturridge insists he will not buckle under the pressure of being England's World Cup number nine. Sturridge underlined his status as one of Europe's most promising strikers last season when he scored 21 goals in the Barclays Premier League. The 24-year-old's career has blossomed since he moved to Anfield, where he formed a lethal partnership with top scorer Luis Suarez, but he is yet to repeat that kind of form on the international stage. Sturridge will be the spearhead of England's attack this summer, just as Alan Shearer and Sir Bobby Charlton were when they wore the famous number nine shirt on their back. VIDEO Scroll down to see Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck talking about England . International: Daniel Sturridge (centre) in action for England against Denmark earlier this year . Lethal: Sturridge (right) formed a deadly partnership with Luis Suarez (left) this season . The former Chelsea man only has 10 caps but he is relaxed about leading the line for England in Brazil. 'I don't feel any pressure in terms of the task ahead because I feel that we have prepared for this,' said Sturridge, whose three England goals have come against San Marino, Montenegro and Denmark. 'I am excited by it all. When you are young you always want these moments. This is my first World Cup. It's about just embracing it all, not about feeling any pressure to do something amazing. 'I just have to play my normal game.' Injury prevented Sturridge from playing alongside Wayne Rooney for a chunk of last season. But Roy Hodgson will hope the pair hit it off in Friday's friendly versus Peru, and the two other warm-up games that follow against Ecuador and Honduras. Partners: Sturridge (left) says that he is confident that he can work well with Wayne Rooney (right) Debutant: This will be Sturridge's first World Cup and he says he is looking forward to it . Another option for Hodgson is to play Rooney and Sturridge alongside Manchester United's Danny Welbeck in a three-man attack. Many England fans remain indifferent about Welbeck despite his record of eight goals in 21 England games. The forward, who has been deployed in midfield for much of United's last two seasons, thinks the World Cup could be place where he proves he deserves to be recognised as a top-class striker. 'I just want to prove myself to me and to the world,' Welbeck said. 'I want to show everyone what I can do. Going into the World Cup is a massive stage and I can't wait to do that.' Welbeck had a stop-start season with United last year, but he still found the net 11 times - a significant improvement on the two he scored the year before. Welbeck looked in good shape during England's open training session in Vale do Lobo on Wednesday. Better: Danny Welbeck (left) improved greatly on his goal tally this season, scoring 11 times overall . International: Welbeck (left) is seen as a key part of Roy Hodgson's (right) plans . Much to his dismay, Rooney was made to sit out the final part of that session as Hodgson does not want to take any risks with the United striker, who ended the season with a groin injury. Welbeck thinks his United team-mate is champing at the bit to return to action. He said: 'Wayne is a great player for club and country. He is fit and raring to go and we all know what he can produce on the big stages so I am really excited to see him and what he can do for England in a World Cup.' Welbeck, who scored against Sweden in Euro 2012, is looking forward to getting the warm-up games out of the way so he can taste World Cup football for the first time. 'The training sessions have been good,' said Welbeck, who made his England debut against Ghana in March 2011. 'Everyone is really excited and they want to make sure they are ready for the World Cup.'
