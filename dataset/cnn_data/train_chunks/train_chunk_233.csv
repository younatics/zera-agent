"(CNN) -- Brazil's preparations for a major international soccer tournament have been hit by ""human error"" and heavy rain, which caused the roof of Salvador's host stadium to partially collapse. The Arena Fonte Nova is due to host three matches in the eight-nation Confederations Cup, considered a warmup for the 2014 World Cup also in Brazil, with the first to be played on June 20. But stadium administrators now face major repairs after a triangular tear appeared in one section of the roof on Monday as it buckled under the weight of rain water. The Fonte Nova Participacoes (FNP) group, which manages the stadium, said in a statement: ""The breakup of a part of the 36 panels of the roof membrane was (caused) by human error. ""The FNP checked the sealing cover the previous day, taking advantage of the non-operation of the Games stadium. ""During this procedure a portion of the membrane covering the metal deck was bent, which eventually became a barrier, causing an accumulation of rain water which prevented the correct outlets for drainage."" CNN affiliate TV Record showed aerial images of the stadium staff using buckets to remove pools of water from other sections of the roof to try to prevent further collapses. FNP said repair work was already under way and that the stadium would be ready for its first Confederations Cup match, a Group B tie between Nigeria and Uruguay. It added that the roof structure of the Fonte Nova arena had passed resistance tests, and stressed that this was an isolated incident. However, it confirmed it would now carry out a major inspection of the stadium. The arena, in the north-east city of Salvador, was the third purpose-built stadium to be inaugurated ahead of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. It will host six games during the world football's prestigious event and won praise when it passed its official test event last month. But the partial roof collapse is the type of public relations disaster Brazil is desperate to avoid. The South American country is already drawing extra global scrutiny as it hosts back-to-back major sporting events, with the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro following next year's World Cup. Rio's Maracana stadium, considered a cathedral of world football, finally reopened last month after a two-year, $500 million renovation. But the Joao Havelange Olympic stadium in Rio, which is due to host the track and field events at the Olympics and is also home to Botafogo football club, has been closed indefinitely after it was found to have major structural flaws. The Confederations Cup will also be a trial run of infrastructure -- from hotels to airports and urban transport. More than half a million tickets have already been sold and many fans will want to travel from one city to another to follow their team. The Confederations Cup pits continental champions against each other, with world champions Spain among the teams joining hosts Brazil. For football fans it is a chance to savor some end-of-season international action, but for Brazil -- which last staged the World Cup in 1950 -- it is a chance to prove it can again host a major sporting spectacle.","Part of the roof of a soccer stadium in Brazil collapses in heavy rain .

"(CNN) -- In the latest in a series of recent incidents that threaten to involve Lebanon in the civil war next door, two rockets fired from Syria landed Tuesday in and near the Lebanese city of Hermel, Lebanon's state news agency NNA reported. No one was hurt in the city, which is a Hezbollah stronghold. It was not immediately known who fired the rockets. Hezbollah, the militant Shiite movement, has been backing the Syrian government in its fight against anti-government rebels. Earlier Tuesday, three Lebanese soldiers were killed when unknown armed men opened fire at a military checkpoint near Lebanon's border with Syria, according to NNA. The attack, in the eastern border town of Arsal, was branded a ""heinous crime"" by former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri. ""It requires all political groups to be vigilant and wise, to enable the army to accomplish its mission of protecting this peace, and to keep away from ongoing operations aiming to drag Lebanon into the fighting inside Syria, which will fuel incitement and turn the State and its military and security institutions into a false witness of policies that are not in the national interest,"" Hariri said in a statement published by NNA. Arsal is known for its links to Lebanese Sunni rebel sympathizers; some of its residents are believed to be fighting under the banner of the radical group al-Nusra Front. The Arab World's lost generation . Tuesday's attack on the Lebanese army in Arsal marks the second such incident in the northeastern town, where many Sunni residents accuse the Lebanese military of conspiring with the Shiite Hezbollah in targeting Arsal because it is considered to be the main smuggling route for the Syrian rebels. Afterward, the Free Syrian Army's chief of staff vowed to ""take all measures"" against Hezbollah militants if they don't halt their operations in support of Damascus within 24 hours. ""I tell the Lebanese president, Arab League chief and United Nations secretary-general that, if Hezbollah's attack against Syrian territories does not stop within 24 hours, then we will take all measures and reach Hezbollah, even in hell,"" Gen. Salam Idris told the Al Arabiya TV network. ""We are being subjected to genocide at the hands of Hezbollah."" Q&A: Is Syrian war escalating to wider conflict? In March, two Syrian jets fired three rockets into empty buildings near Arsal. On Monday, a 17-year-old girl was killed and two other people were wounded when four rockets launched from Syria landed in Hermel, NNA reported. European Union to lift embargo on rebels . The European Union voted Monday to lift its embargo on arming Syrian rebels effective in August, in a move that British Foreign Secretary William Hague said was intended to pressure Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to negotiate. ""It was a difficult decision for some countries, but it was necessary and right to reinforce international efforts to reach a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Syria,"" Hague said in a written statement. ""It was important for Europe to send a clear signal to the Assad regime that it has to negotiate seriously, and that all options remain on the table if it refuses to do so."" The Syrian National Coalition, an opposition umbrella group, said the EU's decision did not go far enough. Spokesman Louay Safi predicted that the Syrian regime will ""escalate its brutality"" against civilians during the coming weeks, before EU countries can send arms to rebels. The coalition stressed in a statement that ""words must be solidified by action."" Opinion: Syrian hostilities bring Middle East catastrophe closer . A statement posted Tuesday on the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency and attributed only to a spokesperson for the Foreign and Expatriates Ministry blasted the move. ""The recent EU decision exposes the falsity of their allegations and it proves they are hindering the international efforts aimed at contributing to achieving a political settlement to the crisis in Syria based on national dialogue among the Syrians led by Syria,"" the spokesperson said. The statement said ""the decision uncovers the political hypocrisy of France and Britain, which claim to care about the interests of the Syrian people, while they push at the European Union for taking new decisions to renew the economic sanctions imposed on Syria and supply terrorists in Syria with weapons."" Russia to send more weapons to Syria . Iran blasted the EU's decision, warning that the move would encourage terrorism in European countries. ""The decision to lift the embargoes on arms shipment to the terrorist groups in Syria is a dangerous one,"" said Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. ""By their incorrect decision to support such groups, the European countries brought the terrorists thousands of kilometers closer to their soil and such a hasty and incorrect decision will certainly increase threats against them."" Russia's deputy foreign minister similarly slammed the decision, saying that arming the rebels would undermine the peace process and amount to an ""example of double standards."" Russia said it would move ahead with plans to ship S-300 surface-to-air missiles to the Syrian government, contending that doing so may help contain the conflict. ""We believe that moves like this one to a great degree restrain some hotheads from escalating the conflict to the international scale, from involving external forces,"" said Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, according to the state-run Russia Today news agency. ""The S-300 supplies to Syria are being made under a contract that was signed several years ago,"" Ryabkov told reporters Tuesday. Russia has long insisted its weapons sales to the Syrian government stem from pre-existing contracts, including some from the Soviet era. Russia's announcement did not sit well with Israel, which is just southwest of Syria. ""Obviously, from our perspective, it is a threat at this stage,"" Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon told reporters at a Home Front Command Base in Ramla, Israel. ""The shipments are not on their way yet, this I can say. I hope they will not leave and if, God forbid, they reach Syria, we will know what to do."" Unrest in Syria began in March 2011, when regime security forces clamped down on peaceful protesters. The conflict eventually morphed into a civil war that has killed more than 80,000 people -- most of them civilians, according to the United Nations. Dissidents say al-Assad's forces indiscriminately shell neighborhoods that are known as opposition hotbeds; al-Assad says his forces are trying to save the country from terrorists. On Tuesday, at least 112 people were killed across Syria, including three women and 11 children, according to the Local Coordination Committees in Syria, an opposition group. More than 30 of the reported deaths happened in Damascus and its suburbs. Sectarian strife flares in Lebanon . Western nations conflicted . While many countries -- including the United States, France and Britain -- have called for al-Assad to step down, they have not agreed on whether to arm Syrian rebels. Britain and France led efforts to lift the EU arms embargo on Syria. Both nations suggested joining countries such as Qatar in providing weapons to rebels, arguing such a step would strengthen moderate rebels and make them less reliant on well-armed extremists in their ranks. The United States has been reluctant to arm rebels, fearing that the weapons could end up in the wrong hands. In recent months, radical Islamic militants such as members of al-Nusra Front have joined the rebels in fighting against the regime. The United States has designated al-Nusra Front as a pro-al Qaeda terrorist group. Interactive: War not only about Syria . But U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said this month that Washington was reconsidering its policy of not providing weapons to the rebels. ""You look at, and rethink, all options. That doesn't mean you do or you will,"" Hagel said. McCain makes unannounced trip to Syria . U.S. Sen. John McCain entered Syria through Turkey on Monday, making him the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit during the war. The Arizona Republican met with 18 commanders of the rebel Free Syrian Army near the country's northern border, according to the Washington-based Syrian Emergency Task Force, which helped plan the trip and traveled with McCain. The rebels' ""main message was that we are desperate for ammunition, we are desperate for weapons,"" said Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the group. Opinion: Obama's no-win options in Syria . McCain has for months urged that the United States support arming Syrian rebels. But during his meeting with rebel leaders, McCain also mentioned his concerns about extremism in the country, Moustafa said. The FSA commanders said they are confident that, if weapons go to the army's Supreme Military Council, they ""will not fall in the wrong hands,"" Moustafa said. CNN's Holly Yan, Salma Abdelaziz, Hamdi Alkhshali and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: Iran slams the EU's decision to lift its embargo on arming Syrian rebels .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Two attackers and a security guard were killed on Wednesday during an assault on a Red Cross building in Afghanistan and a gun battle between police and militants, an Interior Ministry spokesman said. Insurgents stormed the International Committee of the Red Cross building in Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan. Afghan parliament member Haji Hazrat Ali told CNN the incident started with one attacker blowing himself up and others entering the building. Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said forces surrounded the building and engaged in a gun battle with the attackers. Seven foreign nationals were rescued and one ICRC foreign staffer was slightly injured, he said. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said Afghan personnel secured the scene. The ICRC confirmed an incident occurred at the building. On Friday, attackers wielding suicide bombs, grenades and machine guns in Kabul struck the compound of another foreign agency -- the International Organization for Migration. Three Afghans died in the strike, the IOM said, and three international staffers were wounded, one seriously. The agency also said all of the attackers were killed. The IOM helps displaced people across the world. Governor's office attacked in Panjshir province . Six men with explosives strapped to their bodies attacked a governor's office in northeastern Afghanistan just before dawn Wednesday, authorities said. One of the attackers blew himself up; the others were shot dead by Afghan security forces, Sediqqi said. The attack at the offices of the Panjshir governor also left one police officer dead and four others injured. Panjshir is one of 34 provinces that make up Afghanistan. In recent months, militants have repeatedly tested the Afghan security forces. With international troops gradually moving out of the country, local police and the Afghan army have been left responding to the increasing attacks on their own.","NEW: 3 killed in attack on International Committee of Red Cross building in Jalalabad, Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- Five people remained in the hospital -- one in critical condition -- two days after a commuter train derailed and struck another train on one of the busiest tracks in the country, officials said Sunday. National Transportation Safety Board investigators looking at the accident, along the corridor from New York to New Haven, Connecticut, are focusing on a broken rail as a possible cause for Friday's rush-hour collision. ""All of our teams have been working around the clock to gather information and facts that will help us determine what caused this accident and what we can do to prevent it from happening again, Earl Weener of the NTSB told reporters Sunday. For now, a long stretch of track that more than 30,000 passengers use daily will be shut down. That includes Metro-North service for a 30-mile stretch between New Haven and South Norwalk, Connecticut, and Amtrak service between New York and New Haven. Amtrak released a statement Sunday night saying that service between Boston and New Haven also would be limited, and ""there is no estimate on service restoration."" Because of that inconvenience, Amtrak said passengers who ""have paid but choose not to travel due to this service disruption can receive a refund or a voucher for future travel."" Investigators have ruled out foul play in the crash, which injured more than 70 people. Cindy Nunes and John Cappiello, spokespeople for Bridgeport Hospital in Connecticut, said three patients were still there Sunday -- one person in critical condition and two listed as stable. Two patients remained at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport, both in good condition, spokeswoman Lucinda Ames said. By Sunday afternoon, all the rail cars had been removed from the accident site, said Weener. Two segments of rail in the area of the fracture also had been removed and are being sent to a laboratory for analysis, he said. None of the cars flipped over when the two trains collided, but many cars were heavily damaged. Some had gaping holes where doors had been. Deep scrape marks were easily visible where one train sideswiped the other. Investigators will look at the trains' braking performances, wheel and track conditions, and speed and other information from data recorders, Weener said. In addition to the trains, investigators also are examining the actions of the crews. He said the track could have been broken by the accident or could have been fractured before the trains collided. This accident involved commuter rail cars built to new codes, he said Sunday. ""This gives us a chance to see how effective the new standards are,"" he told CNN. The two tracks will have to be repaired before they can be reopened. ""Our crews will essentially be rebuilding 2,000 feet of damaged track and overhead wires and signal system,"" Metro-North Railroad President Howard Permut said in a statement. Because of a bridge replacement project, those two tracks are the only way in and out of New York City by train from that part of Connecticut. Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said the state would set up a system to take Metro-North patrons from Bridgeport to the closest operable station, in South Norwalk, during the shutdown. The city of Fairfield, which has three affected train stations, sent out a message telling commuters there will not be enough extra buses to handle normal passenger volume on Monday. It encouraged people to consider staying home. 'Everybody was doing what they could' Daniel Solomon, a trauma surgeon, was in the front car and barely felt the crash when it happened. He didn't understand the severity of the situation at first. ""But when I reached the back of the car, I realized that the damage was a lot more severe, and people were filing out of the middle car pretty badly bloodied,"" he told CNN on Sunday. His medical training kicked in as he helped an injured woman off the tracks and attended to others. Solomon said his fellow commuters remained calm and were eager to lend a hand. ""I think everybody's Good Samaritan instinct took effect, and everybody was doing what they could,"" he said. 'Absolutely staggering' damage . The damage to the tracks and several train cars is ""absolutely staggering,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who visited the site with other officials Saturday. Wreckage littered an area of about 200 yards. ""Ribbons of the sides of cars are torn away like ribbons of cloth,"" the senator said. ""Tons of metal tossed around like toy things. The insides of cars are shattered."" The two Metro-North passenger trains, heading in opposite directions, collided Friday evening in southwestern Connecticut. The train heading from New York City to New Haven derailed around 6:10 p.m. and struck the other train in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Weener said Saturday. Both trains were traveling at about 70 mph immediately before the crash. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Susan Candiotti, Chris Welch, Rob Frehse, Chris Welch, AnneClaire Stapleton, Jason Hanna, Jordana Ossad, and Mark Morgenstein contributed to this report.","NEW: ""I think everybody's Good Samaritan instinct took effect,"" a passenger tells CNN .

"(CNN) -- Two days after staging the biggest club game on the planet, Wembley Stadium hosted the richest match in world football - with Crystal Palace taking spoils worth $180 million as they gained promotion to the English Premier League. Less than 48 hours after Bayern Munich beat Borussia Dortmund 2-1 to lift the European Champions League, Crystal Palace beat Watford 1-0 after extra-time to earn promotion from the Championship, the division immediately below the Premier League. The winning goal in front of a packed crowd containing honorary Watford chairman Elton John and outgoing Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho came from Kevin Phillips, whose professional career started at Watford and who had lost his three previous playoff finals. He was given the chance after 105 minutes from the penalty spot and despite the intense pressure of securing riches galore for his club on a sweltering day at Wembley, a man who turns 40 in July was coolness personified as he fired high into the net. The kick was effectively worth $180 million - with half of that coming from television revenue and another $90m from the parachute payments that go to any team that drops out of the Premier League. With the team that finishes bottom of the Premier League earning a minimum of $1.1m in addition to the extra revenue brought in from gate receipts, Palace's owners can plan for the future with real optimism even if the club is relegated after just one season in the top flight. The club hierarchy had craved promotion so that funds could be used to redevelop their Selhurst Park stadium. ""We are in the Premier League - so God help us,"" laughed winning coach Ian Holloway. ""It is absolutely massive to be back in the Premier League. They have plans to do up the ground and I am so happy for everyone connected with the club."" Relegation has befallen Palace every time they have gained promotion to the Premier League, while only nine of the 21 playoff winners have managed to stay in the division the following season, so Holloway is likely to have a busy summer trying to improve his squad. He already knows that he must do without winger Wilfried Zaha, who was the outstanding player on the pitch and whose trickery was finally rewarded when he won the penalty at the end of the first period of extra-time. Zaha, the 20-year-old who earned his first England call-up last November, agreed to join English champions Manchester United in January, so becoming the last signing of outgoing manager Alex Ferguson. He was bought for $24 million and instantly loaned back to the club whose academy he joined at the age of 10, six years after moving to London from his native Ivory Coast. ""I'm speechless - this is a dream come true,"" Zaha told Sky Sports television after the game. ""This is all I wanted, leaving Palace knowing they are in the Premier League. I just told myself to give it all I can - 100%, 200%. ""I've been at the club so long. All I want to do is help out the team, I'm so glad we made it to the Premier League."" Monday's success caps a remarkable turnaround for Palace. Three years ago, fans were fearing for their favorites' future as they protested outside a bank as a club founded in 1905 was threatened with extinction. Docked 10 points by the Football League for going into administration, Palace not only escaped liquidation but also managed to avoid relegation to the third tier of English football on the last day of the 2009-2010 season. Palace fans would have been nervous again in the last minute of extra-time as Watford's Fernando Forestieri curled an effort towards the far corner only for Joel Ward to clear off the line. The club joins Cardiff and Hull in winning promotion to the Premier League from the Championship, with Queens Park Rangers, Reading and Wigan Athletic heading in the opposite direction. Gianfranco Zola's Watford, who were seeking a return to the top flight for the first time in six years, ultimately paid the price for slipping up on the final day of the season, losing at home to Leeds United when victory would have earned promotion. The club has been criticized this season for bringing in a number of players on loan from sister clubs Udinese (Italy) and Granada (Spain), which are also owned by the Pozzo family. Despite the last 10 competitive meetings between Watford and Palace producing 38 goals, Monday's game at Wembley ended goalless after 90 minutes - as the massive expectation seemed to weigh upon both team's players. Nonetheless, all associated with Crystal Palace can now look forward to Wednesday 19 June with great excitement as that is when the 2013-14 Premier League fixtures are set to be released.","Crystal Palace beat Watford 1-0 after extra-time to earn promotion to the Premier League .

"New York (CNN) -- A Hofstra University student who died during a confrontation between a home invasion suspect and authorities was killed by police gunfire, a Nassau County, New York, police spokeswoman said Saturday. Police fired eight shots at the intruder, who authorities say was holding a gun to the head of Andrea Rebello, 21, during a home invasion robbery Friday at an off-campus house in Uniondale. One of the shots hit Rebello in the head, killing her, police spokeswoman Maureen Roach said. Also killed was the intruder, whom authorities identified as Dalton Smith, 30, of Hempstead. He was struck seven times. Authorities say Smith was wearing a mask. He invaded the home Rebello shared with her twin sister and two others during the predawn hours on Friday. At some point, a female roommate of the twins was able to leave the home and call police, a police spokesman told CNN on Friday. When a police officer arrived, Smith was holding a gun to Rebello's head, Roach said. He told the officer he was going to kill Rebello, and then turned the handgun toward the officer, she said. The officer, fearing for his life, drew his gun and fired, Roach said. Authorities have not identified the officer. At the time of the shooting, Smith was wanted for jumping parole, police said. He was on parole for first-degree robbery and had an ""extensive"" arrest history that includes robbery, assault, and promoting prison contraband, said police in Nassau County. A warrant for his arrest was issued April 25 for allegedly absconding from parole, police said . Rebello's high school principal, Carol Conklin-Spillane, said the twins' home community in Westchester, New York, was heartbroken. She described Rebello as a fun-loving, personable and self-aware young woman. Her parents, Fernando and Nella Rebello, are closely tied to the Portuguese community, and always worked to create opportunities for their children, Conklin-Spillane said. Rebello, a junior, was majoring in public relations. Hofstra University said it is offering counseling to students. ""Our hearts and minds and our thoughts and prayers are with her family, her friends and her classmates,"" the university said in a statement. A funeral mass is planned for Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- Airport hotels have always been necessary but unloved stopover spots for the depleted traveler, places to shower, rehydrate and let the body recuperate from the merciless rigors of flying. Yet checking into the Hilton Frankfurt Airport, which opened in December turned out to be much more. It's an example of the emerging generation of airport hotels that are intended to function as destinations, real places where one might reasonably stay longer than a single night. Some of the best and most spectacular airport hotels are in Asia: the Regal in Hong Kong; the Crowne Plaza in Singapore. Now the rest of the world is catching up, and the newest airport hotels in Europe, the United States, Latin America, and elsewhere are responding to the generalized craving for experience. And there's more going on than that: the increasing sophistication of these hotels parallels a reemergence of civilization—daring architecture; edible food—in airports themselves. Travel + Leisure: Innovative new airport terminals . The improved hotels are one component of a backlash against that shiny one-world placelessness that airports have long cultivated. Moreover, they are being retooled for a new breed of business traveler. ""The nature of work is changing,"" says Erin Hoover, head of design for the Sheraton and Westin brands, ""and it's very collaborative."" Now airport hotels—like the newly opened Hilton in London, Novotel in Auckland, New Zealand, and Element in Miami—are catching up, bringing technology, design, and style to the international stopover. Hilton Frankfurt Airport . The Hilton Frankfurt Airport is a stylish, hyper-connected oasis. The hotel, along with the lower-priced Hilton Garden Inn, occupies the eastern end of the Squaire (a name meant to evoke town square and air), an ultra-elongated mixed-use complex that rests on angled columns atop a high-speed rail station, is adjacent to the airport's commuter train station, and is squeezed between two major autobahns. When Squaire managing director Christoph Nebl characterizes it as ""the best-connected spot in Europe,"" he's not exaggerating. Travel + Leisure: America's safest airports . Sheraton Malpensa Hotel (Milan) A series of glass modules lined up like the teeth of a comb, this property makes for a fitting addition to a world capital of design. Atlanta Airport Marriott Gateway . Two minutes from the terminal via SkyTrain, the building is LEED certified and has a lobby floor made of terrazzo embedded with glass. Aloft San Francisco International Airport . A newly rehabbed Clarion Inn building—dropped ceilings have been removed to give the rooms at this hotel an airy feel, and an expanded lobby big enough for a bustling bar scene has been added.

Hilton Heathrow Terminal 5, U.K. From its glamorous all-white main lobby staircase and unusually glitzy light fixtures to perfectly manicured exterior grounds and a celebrity chef--helmed restaurant (Mr. Todiwala's Kitchen), this property has all the makings of a hotel hot spot.

"(CNN) -- Oklahomans have a special relationship with the sky. We know how to look up. On the prairies of western Oklahoma, the skies are so big, and so full, it is easy to feel you may begin to fall upward, or even fly. To live underneath this unbroken expanse of heaven can be at once inspiring and terrifying. Every Okie has seen those skies turn scary, and every Okie accepts that atmospheric instability is a part of our legacy. In school and from our trusted local meteorologists, we learn from an early age what to look for in a sky, in a radar map and in a safe place. Green-tinted clouds are never a good sign; a hook echo on a radar -- the telltale swirl at the edge of a storm pattern indicating strong rotation -- means take cover. Underground is best, in a basement or storm shelter. But a small, ground-floor room with no exterior walls will do if the tornado isn't too strong. Cover up with a mattress or thick blanket to avoid debris; don't open all the windows in the house, contrary to now discredited advice; don't hide under an overpass. Opinion: How can we be sage from tornadoes? If this liturgy of weather preparedness is part of the Oklahoma psyche, so, unfortunately, is devastation. Fourteen years ago this month, one of the worst tornadoes in history roared through Moore, Oklahoma, taking dozens of lives and hundreds of homes. Long after the initial cleanup was completed, the disaster was everywhere apparent. The branches of trees were gnarled by the winds into unreal shapes, their leaves growing close to the bark as if for protection. Neighborhoods that once were thick with homes seemed almost to revert to the fields from which they'd sprung. For those who lost homes, it took months, sometimes years, to become whole. For those who lost loved ones, that never happened. That is why for the people of Moore, what happened on May 20 feels impossible. It is impossible that this happened here again. It is impossible to reduce the suffering to a number: lives lost, homes destroyed, damage expressed in dollars. For many, it must feel impossible to know where to begin to carry on. Inside a tornado-ravaged school . How does a community make sense of destruction on the level carried out by Monday's storm? In Moore, it began almost as soon as the tornado touched down. Teachers at Plaza Towers and Briarwood elementary schools threw their bodies over their students to protect them from debris. Survivors flooded the streets helping to dig their neighbors out from under collapsed homes. Trucks filled with supplies raced to the scene. We help. That is how we begin. It's what we know how to do. Word just came from Red Cross Oklahoma that Oklahoma City Thunder star forward Kevin Durant has donated $1 million to disaster relief efforts; Devon Energy, headquartered in Oklahoma City, donated $2.5 million. Thousands more from all over the country have donated what they can. For Okies, this is what home is about. Opinion: The making of a nightmare tornado . The ""Oklahoma Standard,"" exhibited to the world after the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, after the May 3, 1999, tornado, and today, is who we are. What is on display before the world's eyes is not only a community's response to a disaster but an exhibition of something essential to the Oklahoma character. We make sense of disaster by showing up and doing what we can. We find meaning in a bottle of water, a rescued pet, a family reunited, an act of selflessness. These things -- and not disasters -- are what define home for us. Home, to borrow a phrase from the Bible, is where we live and move and have our being. It is not only where but who we are.

"(CNN) -- Hackers using a server in China stole the blueprints for the new headquarters of Australia's main spy agency ""some time ago,"" an opposition senator said Wednesday, contradicting comments by the country's prime minister. The controversy stems from a TV report this week alleging that a cyberattack swiped the blueprints to the new headquarters of the ASIO, Australia's top intelligence organization, including details on the building's security and communications systems, its floor plan and the locations of its servers. ""These events did take place some time ago; they were dealt with by ASIO,"" said George Brandis, the deputy leader of the opposition in the Senate who is responsible for national security issues. ""I'm reassured by the director general about the way in which they were dealt with by ASIO."" He was speaking in an interview with CNN affiliate Sky News Australia following a private briefing with David Irvine, the director-general of the spy agency. Prime Minister Julia Gillard on Tuesday described the report, by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's investigative program Four Corners, as ""inaccurate."" The program also reported that hackers, thought to be from China, had breached government agencies including the prime minister's office and cabinet, as well as the departments of foreign affairs and defense. ""There were a number of unsubstantiated allegations of hacking in the Four Corners report as the attorney general has stated,"" Gillard said in parliament. ""Neither he or the director general of ASIO intend to comment further on these inaccurate reports."" But Brandis disputed Gillard's statement. ""The prime minister in question time yesterday just dismissed the report entirely as being inaccurate, and that claim by the prime minister is false,"" he said. Gillard's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Brandis's remarks. Brandis's office didn't immediately make him available for further comment on the matter. Australia the 'lucky country' for a better life: survey . At a foreign ministry news conference Tuesday, a Chinese government official called the report a ""baseless accusation."" ""Since the attacks are technically untraceable, it's difficult to find the origin of these attacks,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei. ""I don't know where does the evidence come from for media to make such reports."" Hong added that cybersecurity is an issue internationally and it calls for a ""calm and thorough discussion."" ""Making baseless accusation will not help to improve the current situation,"" he said. Earlier this month, the United States accused China of trying to extract sensitive information from U.S. government computers. A Pentagon report said China was carrying out the attacks in an effort to extract information from ""diplomatic, economic and defense industrial base sectors that support U.S. national defense programs."" At the time, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said China was ""firmly against any forms of cyberattacks."" Beijing has in the past insisted that China is the victim of cyberattacks, most originating in the United States. Watch where you click: International cyber attacks on the rise .

"(CNN) -- Presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin says that even though a lot of modern debates are programmed, there are still moments that no one expected. ""And it's sort of like championship boxing,"" she says, ""you do get revelations of character, of temperament, of humor, of anger, and you get a feeling of this person during these one-on-one debates that really nothing else can provide."" Goodwin describes 10 key presidential and vice presidential debates that made a difference: . 1960 -- Kennedy vs. Nixon: First TV debate . Just having Kennedy on the same stage as an experienced vice president made a difference for JFK because he could hold his own with Nixon. But then, of course, when it was listened to on the radio, it made it seem like it was pretty equal, and even some people giving an edge to Nixon. But he looked so terrible. His makeup was bad. He wasn't feeling well. He looked sallow, He looked scornful. And people just reacted to that image of a vigorous, young Kennedy, and an almost sick-looking Nixon. And from then on, somehow JFK became a figure. iReport: 10 questions you would ask at the presidential debate . 1976 -- Carter vs. Ford: No Soviet domination of Eastern Europe? Ford had done well in the first debate, but in the second debate he was asked a question about Soviet domination of Eastern Europe. And he answered it incomprehensibly. There was already a perception, a vulnerability, that he wasn't intelligent. And then this thing just got parodied, just got talked about, and became a huge event. When ordinary people watched that debate, they didn't feel the Ford had screwed up. But when it was pointed out, that he didn't understand what was happening in the Cold War in Eastern Europe, then suddenly they had shifted their minds, and he seemed much worse than it had seemed at that moment. 1980 -- Reagan vs. Carter: 'There you go again' In 1980, Carter was primed to go after Reagan about his record, especially on Medicare. He was going on the offensive: 'You did this! You voted this way! You said that!' And Reagan, just with humor and subtlety, said, 'There you go again.' And it somehow relaxed Reagan and it took the offensive away from Carter. It was a brilliant answer to a really serious critique of Reagan's past that might have been troubling for him. 1980 -- Reagan vs. Carter: 'Are you better off now than you were four years ago?' There was no more brilliant closing than Reagan's 'Are you better off now than you were four years ago?' What it did was to make people think, 'Yes. That's what's happened to me. My economic life, my family life, my working life, has been hurt by the economy over these last four years.' And once they realized that, it almost gave a poster to the entire campaign. It wasn't just a great moment in the debate, it became a theme encapsulated in just a few sentences. And in the end saying, 'if you are better off, then you vote for Mr. Carter. If you're not, you do have another choice. Me,' And at the same time, Carter gave a very weak closing statement. Opinion: When candidates said 'no' to debates . 1984 -- Mondale vs. Reagan: 'I will not exploit ... my opponent's youth and inexperience' In the first debate between Reagan and Mondale, Reagan had appeared old. He was the oldest candidate in history at that time. He seemed confused by some of the questions, his answers had wandered, and the issue of age really became a large question among the press. So when he comes back in the second debate, and they ask him, 'Do you think age is a problem?' He had that answer prepared, and boy did he nail it. It was subtle, it was humorous, and Mondale knew, he said right then, that he had not only lost the debate, but probably the election. 1988 -- Dukakis vs. George H.W. Bush: 'If your wife, Kitty Dukakis, were raped and murdered?' The question asked to Michael Dukakis in 1988 was a difficult one. I mean, 'What would you do, given your feelings about the death penalty, if your wife, Kitty Dukakis, were raped and murdered?' And what you would've expected might have been a home run, where Dukakis would've said, 'I would've wanted to kill that person who murdered my wife. But we have a country of laws and that would be wrong.' But instead, he answered in a policy-wonkish way about the death penalty that underscored a vulnerability that he already seemed to be without emotion and without passion. 1988 -- Bentsen vs. Quayle: 'You're no Jack Kennedy' During the campaign, Quayle had already been saying many times that he had as much experience as Jack Kennedy did, so Bentsen was primed for that and when he mentioned it again in the debate, I'm sure Bentsen was saying 'Yay! Here comes my line!' And again, Quayle handled it OK and said it probably wasn't called for but it was such a zinger of a line that people loved it and told one another about it and it became the line of that debate. Opinion: The mistakes candidates make in debates . 1992 -- George H.W. Bush looks at his watch . It looked like he was bored, that he didn't care about the debate and that underscored the feeling that he wasn't connected to the problems of the people and the country. He later said when he was looking he was looking at his watch he was thinking, 'I hate these debates, I'm so glad it's almost over.' In that debate Clinton showed his empathy -- he was wandering around the stage. He talked to the people, almost wrapped their arms around them. The debate format in that year was perfect for Clinton because they could wander away from the microphones. When Bush is seen stiffly to be looking at his watch and seemed not engaged, and not connected, it underscored Clinton's enormous capacity to emotionally connect. 1992 -- Stockdale vs. Gore vs. Quayle: 'Who am I? Why am I here?' When [Ross] Perot had chosen [Adm. James] Stockdale as his [running mate], Stockdale appeared to in that debate to be stunned; he almost didn't seem to belong there. He looked like an observer of the other two candidates and that was underlined when he said, 'Who am I, what am I doing here?' What it underscored was a problem of judgment on Perot's part -- how could he have chosen somebody who himself was wondering, 'Why am I here?' It made no sense to the audience and it hurt Perot's credibility as a presidential candidate. 2000 -- Al Gore sighs . Focus groups right after Al Gore and George W. Bush debated seemed to give a slight edge to Gore because he was more articulate, he had better answers, but once the television cameras caught that sighing, that constant look on his face where he seemed annoyed by the whole idea of having to be there with Bush, it seemed to underscore, as somebody said, as a teacher's pet who knew all the answers but was annoying and irritating. And they kept playing it over and over again and it became parodies on the comedy shows and late night TV. Then people began to project onto Gore a personality trait of just annoyance and irritation of people in general and it became devastating for him to live that down.","Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin says debates reveal character strengths and weaknesses .

"(CNN) -- A powerful storm system rumbled through Mississippi and other parts of the Southeast on Thursday, spawning a tornado that killed one person and injured others. At least seven counties in Mississippi and four in Alabama suffered damage as storms from the system rolled through and damaged homes and businesses, according to officials in those states. Georgia's emergency management agency also reported trees down in several counties in that state on Thursday night. This occurred hours after a weak tornado snapped large limbs and caused power outages around Slidell on Louisiana's Gulf coast, according to the National Weather Service. A slew of tornado warnings and watches were issued and, in due time, expired over the course of the day Thursday. Still, some watches -- portending a threat of large hail and damaging wind -- remained in effect through Friday morning in parts of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama and Florida. The area that suffered the most Thursday was Kemper County, Mississippi, on the Alabama border. That's where one person died after strong winds destroyed a steel building along Highway 493, the National Weather Service reported. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency later reported that five people were injured and several homes were damaged in that county. In neighboring Noxubee County, the weather agency said, a ""violent and extremely dangerous"" tornado was spotted near the city of Macon. City Clerk Beverly Shelton said electricity had been knocked out in Macon. There were reports of damaged homes and businesses about 10 miles south in Shuqualak, a town of about 500 people. Across the border in Pickens County, Alabama, radar indicated a tornado set down and the county emergency management director, Ken Gibson, said a path of damage had been left behind in the northwestern part of the county, which borders Mississippi. Of course, such hazardous springtime weather is hardly an anomaly in many of these areas. A cool March meant that there had been significantly fewer tornadoes this year compared with previous ones, CNN's weather unit noted. But that doesn't mean storms will be less powerful, or that the rest of the season will be slow. Just ask the people of Hazelwood, Missouri, where at least 24 homes sustained severe damage from storms Wednesday night, the St. Louis County Office of Emergency Management said. Is severe weather happening near you? Share your story . One tornado touched down in the St. Louis suburb, ripping the roofs off of several homes, Hazelwood Communications Coordinator Tim Davidson said. No serious injuries were immediately reported. Watch as tornado approaches . Hazelwood resident Alisa Daffin spent the night in her bathroom as the storm moved through. When she woke up Thursday, ""it was pitch black and I started having a panic attack,"" she told CNN affiliate KMOV. ""I looked outside, and it got worse."" What she saw were downed trees and power lines. Her home was without electricity or water. ""It looks like a war zone, it doesn't look like my home,"" she told KMOV. Daffin walked half a mile to an elementary school where the Red Cross had set up. After the warning sirens went off Wednesday night, Gary Buneta decided to walk to the back of his house, where he thought he would be safe, but the tornado beat him to it. As he was walking through the house, there was a loud pop, then flying glass before he rose off the ground and was thrown on his kitchen floor. Debris from the ceiling fell, and then it was quiet, he told KMOV. ""The wind just picked me up and moved me that far across my kitchen,"" he said. Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency in Missouri after the series of storms pummeled the St. Louis area and elsewhere across the state. Arkansas was also hard hit, prompting Gov. Mike Beebe to declare 15 counties as state disaster areas. The damage in Arkansas included some 15 homes damaged in Izard County, said state emergency management official Tommy Jackson, and overturned vehicles spotted along U.S. 65, north of Clinton. One tornado touched down in Van Buren County, about 75 miles north of Little Rock, damaging at least 33 homes and injuring three people. The twister demolished the sanctuary, a fellowship area, classrooms and a pavilion at Botkinburg Foursquare Church, its pastor said. ""If the tornado would have come an hour and a half later, we would have been caught in it,"" said Senior Pastor Ester Bass, referring to Wednesday night services. No members of the church were injured. But a passing motorist who parked his truck in the church's covered driveway to get out of the dangerous weather had a close call when the storm struck. ""It shook the truck and just lifted the roof right off the drive-through,"" said Bass. ""He was all right."" Bass, 63, said his congregation of about 100 was left stunned. ""It is just devastating. My wife and I are just torn,"" he said. ""We put a lot of sweat and hard work and it was paying off. The church was growing."" As church leaders prepared to meet with their insurance adjuster, the pastor was thankful for a loyal membership. ""They will be with me,"" he said. ""They are ready to buckle down and do what we have to. With the Lord's help, we are going to rebuild.""

"(CNN) -- It has been a long season for Henrik Stenson but the Swede is on the verge of ending it in style after taking the halfway lead at the DP World Tour Championship. With a win in Dubai, Stenson would become the first man to claim the Race to Dubai -- finishing as the European No. 1 -- and FedEx Cup in the United States in the same season. And the 37-year-old moved closer to making history as he surged atop the leaderboard on the Earth Course at Jumeirah Golf Estates by carding an eight-under-par 64 to move to a total of 12 under. Undone by a bogey on his last hole in the first round, the current European Tour leader didn't drop a shot in the second and struck eight birdies. ""I have my game plan cemented on this course and it's been working out great the first two days,"" Stenson, who is nursing a lingering wrist injury, told the European Tour's website Friday. ""It could have been a bit better but there is no point being greedy. I am delighted with the first two days' work."" Stenson is one of three golfers guaranteed of capturing the Race to Dubai by claiming the title this weekend -- the others are Justin Rose and Graeme McDowell -- and he admits he is keeping an eye on his major rivals. If Ian Poulter emerges triumphant in Dubai, Stenson needs to finish second to clinch the Race to Dubai. Rose and Poulter are five shots adrift but McDowell appears to be out of contention at eight shots behind. ""I keep track of what's happening with the other players, I'm too curious not to,"" said Stenson. ""I saw both Justin and Ian are seven under so they are chasing me as hard as they can. ""They are not going to back down so I better keep my foot and my head down, play another two good rounds and see where that takes me. I am in a great position to have a shot at winning and hopefully I will be there on Sunday afternoon."" Unheralded Spaniard Alejandro Canizares put in his second consecutive solid round -- a 67 -- and trails Stenson by a shot. Last year's Race to Dubai champion Rory McIlroy -- watched this week by his tennis playing girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki -- sits six shots behind Stenson. McIlroy has mostly had a season to forget but his 67 Friday lifted his mood. ""I finally feel I have got to the stage now when I can contend week in, week out and on the rare times I have got into contention this year I feel like I have played my best golf,"" the former world No. 1 told the European Tour's website.","Henrik Stenson shoots an eight-under-par 64 to take the lead in Dubai .

"(CNN) -- The California city of Stockton approved a special budget Tuesday night, paving the way for it to become the largest American city to declare bankruptcy. ""Unfortunately, we have no comprehensive set of agreements with our creditors to offer you ... that would eliminate the $26 million budget deficit and avoid insolvency,"" City Manager Bob Deis said at a council meeting. Negotiations, however, continue with some creditors. ""I think we're very close in announcing some possible deals with some creditors in the future,"" he said. ""In fact, it could be as many as a third of the creditors ... that's not enough to balance the budget."" From the archives: Rhode Island city files for bankruptcy . The city council approved the pendency plan on a 6-1 vote, meaning Stockton will file for protection under Chapter 9 federal bankruptcy laws before Sunday when the new fiscal year begins. The plan is essentially a new budget for the city of about 291,000, spelling out day-to-day operations under bankruptcy. The city, which is about 80 miles east of San Francisco and about 50 miles south of Sacremento, says it will continue to pay employees, vendors and service providers, but curtail most other expenditures, such as debt service. Numerous governments across the country have filed for bankruptcy since the financial crisis of 2008. Last year, Jefferson County, Alabama, filed the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S history. In December, the county was $4.2 billion in debt. The largest previous municipal bankruptcy case was filed in 1994 by Orange County, California, which owed approximately $1.7 billion to creditors. From the archives: Plan released to keep Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, from bankruptcy filing . Stockton Mayor Ann Johnston said in the 1990s the city council approved labor contracts and retiree health insurance plans believing the hyper-growth the city was experiencing would continue forever. Then came the economic downturn of recent years, and debt-strapped California's raid on city finances, said Johnston. Since 2009, Stockton has cut $90 million from its budget, she said. The city has reduced its police force by 25%, its fire department by 30% and other city jobs by 40% but has not been able to get itself financially stable. And then, said Johnston, there was the housing bust. ""The housing was the straw that broke the camel's back,"" said Johnston. ""We had this bubble in our economy here. We were booming in construction. We were building about 3,000 homes a year. It began to fall off sharply three and a half years ago,"" she said. ""This past year only 105 single-family construction permits were issued."" Richard Acosta is a 75-year-old retiree in Stockton and said everywhere he looks there are for-sale signs. ""You have two across from my house. There was like four on the other side, and there's about two or three more down on the next block,"" said Acosta. ""I always thought the city of Stockton was really gonna go somewhere. But I don't really see any future in it for five to 10 years before something really is going to happen here,"" he said. CNN's Ed Payne and CNN Radio's Jim Roope contributed to this report.","Stockton will file for bankruptcy by Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Amid all the noise and chaos of a short-track speed skating final, there is one voice in the crowd Charles Hamelin can hear as clear as a bell. It belongs to his girlfriend and fellow speed skater Marianne St.-Gelais, urging the Canadian on to the finishing line in a competition that is as thrilling as it is dangerous. Hamelin likens his sport to walking on a wire in mid-air, but despite the precarious nature of his chosen discipline, he can always make out her voice above the din. ""She's the only person I can actually hear when I'm skating,"" the double Olympic champion told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""She's really loud in the stands but it's like her voice gives me energy. If I know she's there it gives me belief in myself."" They are both targeting next year's Sochi Olympics in Russia, with St.Gelais -- now 23 -- having won two silvers at Vancouver 2010 while Hamelin became a national hero with two golds on the same day. ""We live together and I know what she's doing and she knows what I'm doing, and it's a good thing to have someone to talk to about everything we love the most,"" Hamelin said. That reassuring presence is clearly key for the 29-year-old from Quebec, in a sport where the margins are miniscule. With competitors haring around the ice at speeds that often near 40 mph, any involuntary nudge or bump can be fatal to their chances of glory. But for Hamelin, who has successfully negotiated his way to eight World Championship titles as well as those two Olympic gold medals, that flavor of danger fuels the adrenaline that keeps him coming back to the rink. ""When we go at our fastest speed it's at the limit. You can't hold it but if you do, if you just let it go, you're going to fall,"" he explained. ""It's like you're walking on a wire in the air, and if you make a little step in the wrong direction, you're going to fall. ""I think it's a thrill to be on every corner -- every two seconds we have a corner. It's a kind of a thrill doing a fast lap in short track and for us, that's what we love, and that's why we are great at it."" Strength is a prerequisite for any speed skater but Hamelin underlines the importance of being able to marry that power to shrewd in-race tactics. Rules forbid speed skaters to intentionally bump their fellow competitors out of the way but contact is inevitable in the jostle to take each corner first. Hamelin's ability to steer the right course and adopt the proper tactics has seen him consistently hit the line ahead of his rivals. ""In short track there's more strategy, there's passing, there's bumping, there's a lot of action in short track, and it's one of the reason why it's a popular sport in the Olympics,"" he said. ""You're not allowed to push anyone, you're not allowed to actually touch anyone, but for sure in a race you're going to have to pass inside or outside and are going to bump a little bit. ""It's not the strongest guy on the line who will win, it's the smartest; the guy who will do the best race, who will win the race, and it's a good thing."" The risk of crashing is high, as is the risk of injury, so skaters learn from a young age how to survive the tumbles. ""When you know how to fall, the injuries are less and less, and you have a better chance to stay healthy,"" Hamelin said. ""If you get injured during the summer, and you miss two or three weeks of training, then the year will be tough for you and not because you're not a good skater. ""You have three weeks to catch up on everyone, so at our level it's really difficult to do that and we try to avoid any big injury, especially when it's an Olympic season."" Speed skating is a sport that runs in the blood of the Hamelin family. Charles' brother Francois has also enjoyed success at the top level, as they formed one half of the Canadian relay team that secured gold in the 5,000 meters at the Vancouver Games in 2010. Their father, Yves, is the program director for Canada's short skating stars, and led the team to five medals in Vancouver. Francois started skating when he was five and Charles was soon hooked too. Their younger brother Mathieu also took up the sport and the family would spend hours on the ice honing their technique. Charles says it was when he turned 17 and made the World Junior Championships that he dared to dream that his goal of making the Olympics could become a reality. It did at the Winter Games in Turin in 2006, and though his silver medal was an impressive return on debut, it only strengthened his resolve to hit the top of the podium four years later in front of a home crowd. ""It was my day,"" he recalls. ""In the 500 meters I got the gold with a crazy race, a crazy finish, and 30 minutes after I came back on the top of the podium with all my teammates to win gold in the relay. ""Two golds in the one day, in 30 minutes, it was the best day of my life."" With a lifetime ambition fulfilled, some may have been forgiven for thinking Hamelin might take his foot off the gas but if anything, his Olympic success has only galvanized his love of competition. ""When you reach the top of Canada or the top of international competition and you touch the podium, you get the feel of it and you just want to repeat it,"" he said. ""I just want to stay there as long as possible and that's what keeps me wanting it more and more and more. ""Most people ask me why I continued after Vancouver because I won two gold medals, but I say, 'I love my sport and I love to win, so I want to keep doing it and be better at it.'

"Daytona Beach, Florida (CNN) -- Daytona Beach's yearly motorcycle invasion, Bike Week, just concluded its 70th year, and the average attendees were not much younger. Leather-clad riders on Harley-Davidsons could be seen throughout the Florida resort town riding alongside large, stately motorcycles carrying a CEO and lawyers in khaki and blue Oxford button-downs. On the one hand, this is not your father's Bike Week -- the one with the reputation of topless girls and bike gangs fighting in the street. On the other hand, this is your father's Bike Week -- they're still coming with their aging baby boomer friends, though they've mellowed over the years. ""Most of the folks have a good income,"" said Kevin Kilian, vice president of the Daytona Chamber of Commerce. ""They are like me, 40 to 50 year olds, and they are a little long in the tooth,"" said Kilian. Daytona's bike celebration began in 1937, centered on a motorcycle race between the beach and the street. In the beginning, the race and festival were separate weekend family events, Kilian said. The two events came together, expanding into a 10-day celebration throughout the Daytona area. World War II interrupted the event for several years. Over the years, Daytona's Bike Week became seen as a hangout for dangerous motorcycle gangs involved in illegal activities. ""As the progression goes, it was -- I don't want to say rougher -- (rather) a different crowd back in those days,"" said the chamber vice president. ""The stereotype that some attribute to Bike Week doesn't exist anymore."" In the 1980s, Daytona city leaders told the Chamber of Commerce to clean up Bike Week or get rid of it. Over the years, the chamber worked with sponsors, city officials and police to clean up the image by eliminating the rough crowds. They still exist, but not to the extent as it did in the late '80s, yearly attendees say. Some bars in Daytona, however, still have signs on their front doors telling bikers to not wear their bike club ""colors"" or logos on their jackets in order to keep peace among opposing bike clubs or gangs. But the only gang that has over run the town this year has larger waistlines, graying hair and a whole lot more money to spend. Venders sell everything from tourist trinkets, leather gear and motorcycles accessories. The motorcycles themselves that can run as high as $35,000. ""It's more and more commercial just like everything else nowadays,"" said retiree Jerry Howell, describing himself as 60-ish -- while sitting on his motorcycle with his new 60ish- year-old girlfriend. Howell, who recently moved to Florida from Baltimore, says he sees himself as a ""biker"" because he has been riding motorcycles for 50 years, unlike those attending Bike Week today. ""Most people don't have the experience. They go out and buy a new bike, take a course, buy the leathers and the getup and they're instant bikers -- but it doesn't work that way,"" said Howell, who has attended Bike Week for many years. ""Nowadays, you got the lawyers and doctors or everybody is a biker. It used to be -- 'bikers' who were here,"" he said, wearing a jeans vest full of biker pins, a biker's head wrap and a face shaven precisely to produce a white mustache and goatee. The really big show occurs along Main Street in Daytona Beach, where people and bikes parade all day and night. Folks from all walks of life can be found along the street shopping, people-watching or grabbing a beer from one of the self-described ""beer girls"" while listening to a live band cranking out a rock classic from the '80s. Aging bikers covered with tattoos, before tattoos were part of pop culture, seem to have mellowed -- like one biker who walked down the street proudly carrying his teacup Chihuahua. Most people come with a husband, wife, partner, parent, child or fellow biker. Paul Hatton and his 21-year-old son pulled two bikes on a trailer from Houston to Daytona. ""This is his first, my son wanted to come down, so I said -- let's go,"" said Hatton. ""You can have a good time, looking at all the bikes and the women,"" he said with a laugh. A couple who both recently retired as laboratory workers at the Veterans Administration in Tampa were surprised by the crowds during their fifth visit to Bike Week. ""I'm amazed by the different types of people you see here, the young kids on their crotch rockets and you see the typical or what you think as the typical biker types that are tough and mean who drink hard and ride hard,"" said Barbara Presnel, 55. But Presnel said she realized once back at the hotel people are just the same as her family. Scott Calico, 30, who lives near Daytona agrees there's no reason to fear bikers.

"Moore, Oklahoma (CNN) -- One week after a tornado devastated the lives and landscape of Moore, much of the city seems frozen in time. But despite the staggering wreckage that still litters the ground, the road to recovery is well under way. Here's the latest on the Oklahoma tornado aftermath. Oklahoma tornado: In context . In the rubble, a shocking find . Desperately digging through the rubble where his house once stood, Tom Bridges made a shocking find on Monday: $2,000 worth of crisp bills. He had kept the money in an envelope tucked away atop a window sill -- a place hidden from view and seemingly safe. But when last week's storm blasted his house to bits, the money went missing. The 68-year-old man and a couple dozen volunteers spent Monday morning combing through rubble that was once his home, searching for the envelope. At one point, they stood in a circle and prayed for the money to turn up. After hours of searching through wreckage 5 feet deep, it did. ""All of a sudden, I saw the window sill. ... I picked that up, and there it was,"" Bridges said shortly after the find, his voice cracking. ""I just, I couldn't believe it. It was a miracle."" He said he hopes to use the money to buy a new pickup, since the storm totaled his vehicles. ""Right now, money is money. I got the clothes on my back and a new toothbrush I bought,"" he said. ""It means a lot. It's just these little things like that really bring some joy in my heart, which I need."" Remembering those lost . Thousands of residents poured into First Baptist Church in Moore for a public memorial and prayer service Sunday night. Tissues in each of the pews greeted the mourners. ""It was pretty amazing celebrating all of the people that died and that lived,"" third-grader Ally Keepers told CNN affiliate KOCO. Ally was inside Plaza Towers Elementary School with the tornado shredded the building and killed seven of her schoolmates. ""Some of my friends died, and I was so upset that Kyle Davis died,"" Ally said. ""I was crying. I went to the cemetery and put some flowers out there for him."" Debby Goss of nearby Shawnee said the mass gathering was therapeutic. ""I think it was probably the start of healing for the community,"" she said. ""This was a good time for them to see each other in one place that wasn't a rescue center or a disaster area. ... There was a peaceful place for them to just sit and think about the other people that are here to support them and help."" Obama tours devastated area . President Barack Obama saw the destruction up close Sunday and vowed to support residents long after the media leaves. ""As fellow Americans, we're going to be there as shelter from the storm for the people of Moore who have been impacted,"" Obama said. He praised local officials, first responders and school principals for their efforts after the storm, which killed 24 people, injured more than 375 others and damaged or demolished 12,000 homes in the Oklahoma City area. Speaking from the wreckage of Plaza Towers Elementary, Obama called on Americans to help with relief efforts. ""It's going to take a long time for this community to rebuild, so I want to urge every American to step up,"" he said, suggesting citizens donate to the American Red Cross website. Governor: We need help now . Shortly before Obama's visit, Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin said her chief request for the federal government was help plowing through regulatory hurdles. ""Basically, what I need is the ability to get through red tape, the ability to get the FEMA funds in here quickly and to get the services that our citizens need to help them recover through this terrible disaster,"" Fallin said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Fallin, a Republican, said the initial reaction from the federal government in assisting her state was fast and effective. ""So far, we have had great response,"" she said, quickly adding that there was a long way to go before Moore returns to normal. ""This is a massive debris field,"" she said. ""It's not just a couple blocks. It's miles."" Schools across town destroyed . Weekend graduation festivities in Moore were infused with reminders of the tragic tornado. When Southmoore High's Alyson Costilla walked across the stage to get her diploma, about a dozen people in the crowd stood and held up pictures of her mother, who died in a 7-Eleven ravaged by the powerful winds. The cost of rebuilding classrooms for Moore's students will be enormous. The city's public schools suffered $45 million in damage, including the two elementary schools that were leveled. Overall, insurance claims related to last week's storm will probably top $2 billion, said Kelly Collins from the Oklahoma Insurance Department. Strangers rush to help . The cleanup can be arduous, if not overwhelming. Caleb Allison stared at the mass of debris that covered the yard where his home once stood. ""Who's going to come get it?"" the high school Spanish teacher wondered last week. But his mammoth problem was quickly solved Sunday with the help of students, parent-teacher association members and fellow teachers from his school and the elementary school where his wife teaches. ""We probably had 70 to 80 people in our front yard, and we cleaned it in a matter of 30 minutes,"" he said. Morgan DeLong, one of the volunteers, said many whose homes survived the storm are eager to help. ""It's kind of our turn to return that blessing and help people out,"" she said. ""It's amazing to just look out and see how our community's coming together."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta; Rene Marsh reported from Moore. CNN's Marlena Baldacci, Jeff Kepnes, Dana Ford, George Howell and Nick Valencia also contributed to this report.","NEW: A man finds $2,000 buried in the rubble of his destroyed home .

"(CNN) -- With his opinion for a narrow majority of the Supreme Court, upholding major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has, for the first time since his confirmation as chief justice in 2005, breached the gap between the conservative and liberal wings of the court on a polarizing political issue. News: Legal scholars unsurprised by Roberts . In doing so, he has jettisoned his reputation as a predictable conservative vote on controversial issues, such as campaign finance reform and affirmative action, that have been decided by a divided court. Roberts, in finding the critical provisions of the Affordable Care Act constitutional, has followed the example of his predecessor, Chief Justice Charles Evan Hughes, who led the court during the tumultuous constitutional battles over President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation. Hughes, like Roberts, sometimes found narrow grounds to uphold New Deal legislation and, as a result, cautiously steered the court away from the public perception that justices voted according to their political values, not constitutional principle. Chief Justice Hughes, and now Chief Justice Roberts, demonstrated that they placed a high value on projecting the image of the court as a nonpartisan judicial institution that upholds the rule of law and is above partisan politics. Hughes skillfully worked to promote the court's public image as nonpartisan, not just in his narrow opinions, but, dramatically, in defending the justices against FDR's attacks and his court-packing plan. Later, in grudging admiration, Roosevelt said that Hughes was ""the best politician in the country."" That was hardly the way Hughes would have chosen to be remembered, but there was much truth in the president's remark. In June 2012 it may be said that Chief Justice Roberts, like Hughes, has employed political as well as judicial skills in his role as the leader of the Supreme Court. News: Emotions high after Supreme Court upholds health care law . Roberts surprised almost everybody, including constitutional pundits and members of the Obama administration, when he announced Thursday's decision upholding the Affordable Care Act's most controversial provision, the individual mandate, under Congress' power to tax. Judges on the lower federal courts who passed judgment on the Affordable Care Act, as well as both the challengers and defenders of the law in the Justice Department, focused their arguments on Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce. The chief justice, after rejecting the administration's Commerce clause argument, turned to the more general power of Congress to tax. And tellingly, he declared that the court was obligated to uphold a law as constitutional if there were reasonable grounds to do so, even if there were alternative grounds to strike it down. In this respect, the chief justice's opinion was a model of judicial restraint, a term that has not frequently been used to describe the Roberts court. The chief justice pointedly wrote that the court did not pass judgment on the wisdom of the law, only its constitutionality. The distinction Roberts made between what may be wise, or even good public policy, and what the Constitution allows, has always been a hallmark of judicial restraint. When the Hughes court in the 1930s, led by four ideological conservatives, struck down major pillars of the New Deal, dissenters accused the justices in the majority of substituting their political judgment for that of popularly elected branches of the federal government. News: By the numbers: Health care insurance . Though Chief Justice Hughes sometimes voted with the court conservatives, he demonstrated, time and again, that he understood the distinction between the role of the political branches of the federal government and that of the court, which is obligated only to rule on the constitutionality of a statute. Today, Chief Justice Roberts, like Hughes (whom he is known to admire), has again struck a blow for judicial restraint and integrity. As a result of Thursday's decision, the ultimate fate of the Affordable Care Act does not reside with a majority of the life-tenured members of the court, but with the political branches of federal government and the American voters. In a representative democracy, this is exactly where the responsibility should be. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Simon.","James Simon: Chief justice breached gap between court's conservative, liberal wings .
He says Roberts upended reputation as predictable conservative, like a predecessor .
He says FDR-era Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes also kept politics out of decisions .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan made sure she made it to the Los Angeles morgue early Friday for her first day of court-ordered community service. ""We can confirm she came in well before her appointed time, between 6 and 6:30 this morning,"" Los Angeles County Coroner Assistant Chief Ed Winter said Friday. Thursday was suppose to be Lohan's first day of work as a morgue janitor, but she was sent away after showing up late for the morning's orientation. Publicist Steven Honig blamed her tardiness on ""a combination of not knowing what entrance to go through and confusion caused by the media waiting for her arrival."" As part of her sentence for a necklace theft conviction, Lohan was ordered to work 120 hours at the county morgue after she completed 360 hours of community service at the Los Angeles Downtown Women's Center, but she was booted from that program for missing too many appointments. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner ruled Wednesday that Lohan had violated her probation. Lohan posted $100,000 bail for her probation revocation, but Sautner ordered her to perform two working shifts -- or eight hours a day -- twice a week at the morgue until her probation revocation hearing November 2. ""Her duties will include general janitorial work like vaccuuming, taking trash out and cleaning bathrooms,"" Winter said. Lohan, 25, was on probation after pleading guilty in May to stealing a necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store. She served five weeks of home confinement ending in June for that misdemeanor theft and violation of another probation. Lohan's legal woes began in 2007 with two drunken driving arrests, and they've been compounded by her failure to attend counseling classes and her failures of alcohol and drug tests. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Lindsay Lohan arrives early for community service, a day after showing up late .

"(CNN) -- The percentage of Americans who self-identify as favoring abortion rights has hit a record low of 41%, while those who consider themselves ""pro-life"" reached 50%, according to a new Gallup poll released Wednesday. The prior record low for people who considered themselves ""pro-choice"" was 42% in 2009; that year 51% identified themselves as ""pro-life,"" according to Gallup. First established in 1975, the survey asks if ""abortion should be legal in all circumstances, legal only under certain circumstances, or illegal in all circumstances."" Since 2001, the middle category has been chosen by about half of poll respondents, who far outnumber those who took either of the absolute choices. About 52% of those currently polled believe abortion should be legal under certain circumstances, a slight increase from last year's findings of 50%. About 20% want abortion to be made illegal in all cases, while about 25% want it legal in all cases, the poll found. Anti-abortion groups were quick to hail the new findings. ""I think medical technology has a lot to do with it,"" said Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, a Washington-based anti-abortion organization. ""People are seeing ultrasound images of their unborn babies and it's changing perceptions."" But abortion rights groups downplayed the labels' significance while also pointing to an apparently increased U.S. willingness to allow abortions in some circumstances. ""The survey shows Americans still strongly support keeping abortion safe and legal,"" said Ted Miller, a spokesman for NARAL Pro-Choice America. ""Pro-choice victories on ballot measures in states like Mississippi and South Dakota in the last few years, combined with the backlash against recent attacks on women's reproductive rights, are a clear sign that voters want to protect a woman's right to choose."" CNN's Chris Boyette contributed to this report.","41% of Americans say they're ""pro-choice,"" the lowest number in Gallup poll history .

"Montpellier (CNN) -- Two men who have become France's first same-sex married couple have opened their hearts about the special qualities in each other that made them want to spend the rest of their lives together. In the nervous minutes leading up to Wednesday's groundbreaking ceremony in the southern city of Montpellier, Bruno Boileau said he adored Vincent Autin's ""charisma, his ability to appease me, calm me down ... also his sensibility and his determination."" And returning the warmth, Autin told CNN in the couple's only interview on their wedding day: ""What I love about him is his objectivity and the way he protects me. He is my great protector."" But their marriage is not just about their love; they also want to build a family and, perhaps, teach future generations how to break down prejudices. ""We want children, we want to pass down values that are important to us, that we hold dear, that are right. And we want grandchildren and great-grandchildren, a real family,"" Autin said. ""One of the reasons we want children is because children have no judgement, and we want to break down society's barriers."" He added that ""when French children are born into this world, they are born with the same rights as everyone else -- but from the moment you said you were a homosexual, society deprived you of some of those rights. Today the French Republic has given these rights back to us."" The 40-year-old, who works for Montpellier's tourism office, expressed his gratitude to those who had helped win the controversial right for same-sex couples to marry, legislation that was signed into law 10 days ago by President Francois Hollande. ""We are very nervous, but obviously excited. This is a step forward for France. What's happened today is thanks to everybody who has been so mobilized over the past few months."" The change in the law has not been without its opponents, prompting sometimes-violent demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of people across France. ""It's very sad that they turned violent,"" Autin said. ""It's always so surprising to feel so attacked, but you must remember this was a minority and most people are in favor. This proves that love can triumph over hatred."" ""So thankful to those who helped us come to this moment. Some of the people we're referring to have passed away, such as Harvey Milk [the first openly gay American elected to public office] who was a great inspiration."" Autin described how the couple met seven years ago. While surfing the net at the same time, they both chanced on an online fan forum for a pop star who found fame on a show similar to ""Pop Idol."" A group of people decided to go for lunch, after which he and Boileau, a 30-year-old civil servant, became inseparable. Like many a couple tying the knot, Autin declined to give details about what outfits they would wear, but he did confide what both parties hoped to get out of the big day: ""Obviously love, but also a great party.""","Two men explain why they have become France's first same-sex married couple .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- At least seven people were killed when a building was attacked in the Afghan capital of Kabul on Friday. All the attackers were gunned down by security forces, the city's police chief said. A police officer and a guard were killed, police said. According to Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry, the incident went on for more than six hours before all five attackers were killed. Sediqqi also said that eight people were injured including one Italian woman, three Nepali guards and four Afghan policemen. He confirmed the death of one policeman, but the Kabul police chief said that one Nepali guard also was killed. The building that came under attack is near headquarters for Afghan and international groups, including the International Organization for Migration -- a U.N.-affiliated group. The United Nations said at least three IOM staffers and a staffer from its International Labour Organization were hurt.","All five attackers were killed, a spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry says .

"(CNN) -- Dear 17-year-old self considering staying home on prom night because you don't have a date, . Oh, you poor, stressed-out, self-hating misfit girl, just suck it up and go. It won't be the night of your life, as all those '80s movies and special TV episodes would lead you to believe. The boy you've had a crush on since junior high won't suddenly declare his hidden love for you as he twirls you across the dance floor (as it turns out, he'd rather ask someone in a tux to dance). There won't have been a secret addendum to the ballot electing you prom queen. No one is packing pig's blood. Your ""virtue"" will remain thoroughly intact. You'll eat a perfectly adequate chicken cordon bleu in the company of your coupled-up and cuter friends (one of whose ""virtue"" will undergo a status change after a six-pack of peach wine coolers). You'll dance badly and happily to ""Funky Cold Medina"" while listening to your girlfriends whine about how their dates are ignoring them in favor of the lively card tournament at the corner table. You'll drink terrible schnapps in someone's cousin's hot tub afterward and comfort your tipsy pals as teenage romantic drama unfolds around you. You'll also learn something pretty fundamental about yourself that night: You don't need anyone's permission to experience life or like yourself. I wish you could see what I see, some 23 years later -- that what seems right now like a shameful, public declaration of your unlovability is actually one of the things you'll use as a source of strength time and time again. When you move to a sharp-edged city where you barely know a soul, board a plane for a solo trip to an unfamiliar country, or walk alone into a glittering party full of bold-faced and beautiful people, you'll sometimes think about that early vote of confidence you took in yourself, square your shoulders and stride in like you belong. You do. The damaging messages of proms . I know you haven't been made to feel that way -- that the boy who you'd gone to the previous dance with quite publicly said no this time. That you haven't been kissed since eighth grade. That your parents were not thrilled by the notion of shelling out cash for a dress when your date was technically a school-owned Nikon camera. You've gone through the indignity of knowing that the faculty advisers had to convene a special meeting to discuss your case and allow you to purchase a single ticket, as they had only ever been sold in pairs. Yes, they decided you could technically attend in your capacity as yearbook photographer (the pictures will be a huge hit on Facebook -- it's a future thing -- the year you all turn 40) but not all teachers had been in favor of that decision -- and made sure you knew they felt that way. And do you really want to embarrass yourself this way? Buy your own corsage, fix your terribly permed, purple-tinted hair, take a deep breath, walk in and make some memories, kid, before it all flickers away. High school prom, 50 years later . Just a few short months from now, everything, all of it, will change -- for the better. The college you chose contains your people -- warm, bold, weirdos bursting with life and art and big dreams, and they'll like you an awful lot. If they'd gone to the prom at all, it was in a tattered dress and combat boots or a duct-tape tailcoat (the man you'll marry attended his with green hair and played in the band) and they'll heartily encourage you to take your fussy little prom frock and turn it into a sculpture. The lack of kissing (and that pesky virtue) will be tended to in fairly short order in the company of a ridiculously beautiful boy who loves you for all your awkward angles and the fact that you don't wait to be asked to dance. And when you look back at all the pictures snapped with that yearbook camera, you'll be awfully glad you handed it off to a few friends as their prom dates spun you around on the dance floor. You're in a few of those pictures. You look dorky, you look delighted, you look so very alive. Follow Kat Kinsman on Twitter and CNN Living on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- The sister of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects has pleaded not guilty to possession of marijuana, according to her attorney. Bella Tsarnaev entered the plea at her arraignment hearing Tuesday to the initial charge of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, Tsarnaev's attorney, Mario Blanch told CNN. Police originally arrested Tsarnaev in December 2012 after responding to a domestic disturbance call and finding marijuana in her Fairview, New Jersey, apartment. Blanch says Tsarnaev, 24, has no prior criminal record, and he is hoping she will be accepted into New Jersey's pretrial intervention program, in which mostly first-time offenders are offered alternatives to the normal prosecution process. No court dates have been set yet. Blanch added that his client has no involvement in the Boston bombing incidents. ""I think she found out about her brothers the way the rest of the country did -- on the news."" Suspect: Boston bombing was payback for hits on Muslims . Tsarnaev's younger brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is currently being held in federal prison and has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction. Her older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed in a shootout with Boston police days after the bombings. One victim of the April 15 attack remains hospitalized. Three people were killed and at least 264 injured in the two bombings near the finish line of the marathon.

"(CNN) -- A dinosaur from the Middle-Late Jurassic period, found in China, gives scientists new understandings of how birds evolved, according to a Wednesday report from the journal Nature. The newly discovered species is called Aurornis xui. ""Aurora"" is Latin for ""daybreak"" or ""dawn."" Ornis is Greek for ""bird."" The last part of the name, xui, honors paleontologist Xu Xing. The dinosaur lived about 150 million years ago, said Pascal Godefroit, lead author and researcher at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels. Read about more dinosaur discoveries . The critter was 51 centimeters -- about 20 inches -- long. It had teeth and probably fed on insects, Godefroit said. It was found in the Tiaojishan Formation of Liaoning Province, China. This dinosaur appears to have had four wings, two along the arms and two along the legs, Godefroit said. It could probably glide but not actively fly off the ground. The specimen, exceptionally preserved in a clay sediment, appears to be an adult. This dinosaur ate like a falcon . Another fossil from about 150 million years ago, called Archaeopteryx, was previously considered the most primitive known bird. Godefroit said the newly discovered dinosaur throws that into question, as the new find appears to represent an even more primitive, older bird. Alan Turner, assistant professor of anatomical sciences at Stony Brook University in New York, who was not involved in the study, said in an e-mail that the find was ""a very interesting fossil discovery."" It demonstrates just how similar the earliest birds were to the earliest members of the dinosaur groups, dromaeosaurids and troodontids, Turner said. These groups are all theropods, small meat-eating dinosaurs that walked on two feet. Michigan cousins go after crayfish, hook a mastodon . Because of how well-preserved and well-prepared the specimen is, it provides useful information about the creature's evolutionary position and the changes that were taking place in the lineage that led to birds, he said. Still, Aurornis xui's exact position in its family tree is likely not set in stone, he said. The relationships between the earliest bird species and their dinosaur relatives can change in subtle ways depending on the data set being used by particular groups of researchers. That means that species that were once called ""birds"" can become considered ""troodontids,"" or vice versa. The exact details are still being worked out, Turner said. ""That's why new discoveries like Aurornis xui are both very exciting and frustrating because they often raise as many questions as they answer,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic survived a first set scare as he booked a place in the second round at Roland Garros after a day of intermittent rain disrupted the French Open. Many matches had to be moved and the schedule reduced in the face of inclement weather in Paris, but the world No. 1 eventually disposed of unseeded Belgian David Goffin 7-6 6-4 7-5. The Serbian didn't get on Court Philippe Chatrier until late in the afternoon but after battling through a tight first set went on to book a round two match with Argentina's Guido Pella. ""[Goffin] did really well at the start, and throughout all the match he was playing really nice tennis from baseline,"" Djokovic told the ATP Tour's official website. ""It was a tough match. I needed to fight all the way through every set, and I served well when I needed to and played my best tennis when it was most important."" On his next opponent, Pella, Djokovic added: ""I know he's one of the specialists on clay; a new player that is coming up and he made some surprising wins. ""I'm going to have to prepare myself and be on top of my game because, especially in the opening rounds, you're playing players that have nothing to lose so I'm sure that he's gonna be very motivated to play his best."" Elsewhere in the men's draw, Australian Bernard Tomic retired hurt after losing the first two sets in his clash with Romania's Victor Hanescu. The 20-year suffered a muscle tear and at a press conference after his match said his controversial father would remain his coach. John Tomic is facing criminal charges after allegedly headbutting his son's training partner Thomas Drouet earlier this month, though he is claiming self-defense. ""My dad is in Paris, he's still my dad and he will remain my coach. I love him a lot,"" Bernard was reported as saying by AFP. Two other players were forced to retire during their matches on Tuesday. Colombian Alejandro Falla handed victory to Bulgarian 26th seed Grigor Dimotrov while Germany's Florian Mayer, seeded 28, quit during his clash with Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan. Veteran Tommy Haas, the No. 12 seed from Germany, beat unseeded Frenchmen Guillaume Rufin 7-6 6-1 6-3. He will now play American youngster Jack Sock after the 20-year-old defeated Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez in straight sets, 6-2 6-2 7-5. The No. 9 seed, Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka, eased past unseeded Dutchman Thiemo Be Bakker 7-5 6-3 6-7 7-5 while Russia's Nikolay Davydenko is also through to round two after a comfortable 6-3 6-4 7-5 win over France's Florent Serra. Djokovic was forced to wait for his first round match after home favorite Marion Bartoli edged a tense three-hour encounter with Russia's Olga Govortsova on Court Philippe Chatrier.

"(CNN) -- He played a huge part in propelling Bradley Wiggins to Tour de France glory but now Michael Rogers is in the dock on doping charges. The Australian has been provisionally suspended by the International Cycling Union (UCI) over a sample he gave at a road race in Japan back in October. Rogers, a three-time world road race champion and 2004 Olympic bronze medalist, left Team Sky for Saxo-Tinkoff prior to the start of the 2013 season. The 33-year-old's team claimed the sample collected at the Japan Cup which contained clenbuterol -- that helps build muscle and burn fat -- came from a contaminated food source. News of Rogers' suspension comes just a day after Team Sky rider Jonathan Tiernan-Locke was told he was facing disciplinary proceedings after analysis of his biological passport showed an anti-doping violation. A statement issued by the UCI read: ""The UCI advised Australian rider Michael Rogers that he is provisionally suspended. ""The decision was made in response to a report from the WADA-accredited laboratory in Tokyo indicating an adverse analytical finding of clenbuterol in a urine sample collected from him in a test during the Japan Cup Cycle Road Race on 20 October 2013. ""The provisional suspension of Mr. Michael Rogers remains in force until a hearing panel convened by his national federation determines whether he has committed an anti-doping rule violation under Article 21 of the UCI Anti-Doping Rules."" ""Mr. Rogers has the right to request and attend the analysis of his B sample."" Rogers was a key member of the group that led Wiggins to his maiden Tour de France win in 2012 -- the first ever by a British cyclist.

"(CNN) -- Last week, Iran's Guardian Council (GC), the ideological body that vets presidential candidates, announced its list of eight men approved to run for office. Although I was fully qualified and campaigned assiduously within the framework of the Islamic Constitution for four months, I ultimately was not on that list -- and the reason has led to much speculation and hearsay. I wish to set the record straight about our campaign and my candidacy for president of Iran. Our campaign began by publishing an 80-page platform in Farsi and English, building websites, and extensively utilizing social media. We also internationalized our campaign by giving interviews to media outlets and speaking at universities and gatherings throughout the world. It was the first Iranian campaign to go global and the first presidential campaign ever by an expatriate. In a short time, our Facebook Likes reached over 100,000 -- largely coming from young Iranians. With these and other accomplishments under our belt, I went to Iran in mid-April to set up a campaign office. During my short stay in Iran, I learned that our campaign is popular and that its fame has become a source of concern for the Islamic system. I was even told by certain officials that the campaign could lead to civic disorder, and that my own safety is a concern. I was advised to stop the campaign, a reference that was also strongly echoed by my political advisers. Despite the warning, I waited until the last day of the registration on May 11 to withdraw, saving my candidacy from the GC's disqualification. Former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's pal -- Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei -- had also been advised against registering but the last two did not heed the counsel and were disqualified by the GC. Clearly, the four of us were popular and a source of concern for Tehran, which is still haunted by the specter of 2009 post-election protests. Read more: Ahmadinejad to contest banning of aide from presidential race . My withdrawal is unfortunate because I am uniquely qualified and our platform is the only one that can help Iran navigate its current impasse. Specifically, Iran is suffering from three inter-connected problems, namely, factional infighting, conflict with the United States and economic malaise. Our platform, the only one offered by a candidate, proposes appropriate policies for the resolution of these issues, and I have been, for most of my life, a bridge builder, a peacemaker and an economic developer. To alleviate factional infighting, I would introduce two measures. First, I would build a governing coalition in which each political faction is represented on the basis of its electoral weight. Second, I would create a National Solidarity Council to serve as a platform for dialogue and understanding to increase transparency, find commonality, and narrow differences among factions. Because I have never been a member or adversary of any faction, I expected to be trusted with this intermediating function. Narrowing factional differences would help depoliticize Iran's U.S. policy. I would introduce five other steps toward normal U.S.-Iran relations. First, I would use my political assets in both countries to build trust between them. I have lived in the U.S. and Iran, been a peace activist in their relations for 25 years, and I know their languages, cultures, concerns, and key policymakers. Second, I would resolve the nuclear dispute by implementing transparency measures required to convince the U.S. that a diversion toward military use will never happen. In return, I would ask that all nuclear-related sanctions be lifted. Read more: Iranian-American launches bid for Iran's presidency . Third, I would establish extensive channels of communication between Iran and the U.S. in an effort to correct misconceptions and mis-analysis. To this end, I would propose a truce period during which Iranians would stop anti-American words and acts, and Americans would address Iran with respect and recognize its national pride. Fourth, I would correct Iran's Palestinian-Israeli policy by accepting the ""two-state"" solution. Last, I would propose that the U.S. and Iran simultaneously announce their will to ""normalize"" relations through agenda-driven bilateral negotiations that would follow. Resolving the U.S.-Iran conflict and factional disputes are keys to Iran's economic development, which I would improve through four additional steps. First, I would adopt an economic plan designed to promote economic productivity, export-led industrialization, and labor market globalization. Second, I would appoint a highly competent economic management and international advisory team. Third, I would stabilize fiscal and monetary policies, streamline the banking system, and introduce modern workforce and entrepreneurship development programs. Last, I would hugely expand Iran's economic interactions with global markets. Through these steps, I would promote foreign investment, technology transfer and exports, increase personal income, and reduce inflation, unemployment and poverty. Although I will not be on the ballot in 2013, we will continue our campaign for real change in Iran under the banner of ""The Campaign for a Better Iran."" I will also look for future opportunities to run again. We believe our platform offers the safest path to an improved Iran and deserves to be supported. Other options, including another revolution, more sanctions, and war are unacceptable. Meanwhile, we hope to convince the country's next president to apply our realistic and pragmatic plan for national reconciliation, resolution of conflict with the U.S., and economic growth.

"(CNN) -- Increasingly, it feels like there is no reprieve from the assault of natural disasters. Month after month, we go from winter storms to spring floods, to tornado and hail storms, to hurricanes, to wildfires, with an earthquake thrown in every so often just to remind us that the seasons don't always dictate the disasters. As a hazard scientist, I am in tune daily with the looming threats of nature and the the places that are most susceptible. Many people, however, don't realize the full extent of the risk they face in their own hometowns and neighborhoods. All it really takes is one catastrophe, like Hurricane Sandy, or the tornado that ripped through Moore, Oklahoma, to turn everyone's attention to the true reality of hazard risk. No place in the United States is risk-free. Some regions of the country are more prone to certain events than others, so in those cases it is never a question of ""if,"" but rather a question of ""when"" and ""how severe will it be?"" Walking the path of a killer tornado . We hear about earthquakes and wildfires in California, hurricanes in Florida or Louisiana, floods along the Mississippi, and probably most well-known, tornadoes in the Midwestern states that make up ""Tornado Alley."" But it would be shortsighted to think these regions have cornered the market on natural hazards. A deeper investigation reveals just how widespread these natural disasters can be. Wildfires burned more than 9 million acres in the U.S. last year. Although California certainly felt the heat with nearly 900,000 acres burned, three other states each lost more than 1 million acres to wildfires in 2012 as well. Idaho had 1.6 million acres scorched and in both Montana and Oregon, 1.2 million acres burned. Yet we don't hear as much about the fires in those states as we do about the blazes near San Diego or Los Angeles. In fact, 49 states are listed on the National Interagency Fire Center website as having lost acreage to wildfires in 2012. Even Hawaii lost 3 square miles of land in 2012, though few people would likely consider the islands to have any wildfire risk. Opinion: How can we be safe from tornadoes? Hurricane-driven storm surge was the lead story when Hurricane Sandy pushed ashore in New York and New Jersey in 2012. But Manhattan had braced for the threat of Hurricane Irene just the year before, a reminder that nature does not space these events to fit our expectations of how often surprising weather events happen. Aside from our heightened awareness of risk in the Northeast, 19 coastal states along the Gulf and Atlantic shorelines all have some degree of flooding risk from hurricane-driven storm surge, stretching from Texas to Maine. Not a single one of these states has less than $2 billion worth of residential property located in a storm-surge zone. The potential of a devastating hurricane is not limited to the states we think of as traditional targets. And of course, there are tornadoes. They hit with less warning than wildfires or hurricanes and are capable of producing tremendous, almost instantaneous damage. It would be comforting for us who live outside Tornado Alley to think that won't happen to us. But the numbers tell a different story. From 2000 to 2011, about 6,700 tornadoes hit in the eight states typically identified as Tornado Alley: Kansas, Oklahoma, Illinois, Nebraska, Texas, Colorado, South Dakota and North Dakota. But 8,800 tornadoes touched down in at least 16 other states during the same time period, in Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, Arkansas, Indiana, Missouri, Georgia, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Florida, Tennessee and Kentucky. The Tornado Alley states lost $2.5 billion in residential property damage from 2000 to 2011 -- but consider that the 16 states outside the Alley suffered nearly $15.5 billion in damage during that same time. Opinion: The making of a nightmare tornado . Are there more severe weather events now than in the past? There's no clear answer. Media coverage has made us more aware, and scientific methods of detection and analysis are much better than 50 years ago. Because disasters are reported more extensively now than ever, it might skew our perception of their frequency. But whether the number of tornadoes, fires, hurricanes and the like is on the rise, it's a sure thing that the population has risen, and continues to rise each year by about 2.5 million a year, according to the Census Bureau. This means that more people will be living in areas at risk, and the number of homes, buildings and infrastructure will be greater. The value of the properties has increased over the years, so any disaster will cause more damage in dollars and cents. More often than not, people outside of traditionally perceived hazard risk regions are not prepared for a weather related disaster. The solution to this inattention begins with awareness and getting familiar with the best tactics to prevent or minimize damage. It's impossible to prevent many of these natural hazards, yet homeowners who are aware of risk can prepare for it -- clearing brush around the house and building with fire resistant materials if they happen to live somewhere where fires have struck, for example. Though you most likely won't be able to build a structure that can withstand an F5 tornado, you certainly can prepare and have a safe location to ride out a storm until the threat passes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tom Jeffery.","Tom Jeffery: It seems like natural disasters are hitting with no reprieve .
Jeffery: No place in the U.S. is risk-free, but in some regions, it's not ""if"" but ""when""

"(CNN) -- New York police say they've found no evidence corroborating a claim by actress Amanda Bynes that she was sexually harassed after police were called to her apartment. ""A credible civilian witness who was with the officers throughout told investigators that none touched Ms. Bynes inappropriately or otherwise engaged in misconduct at any time,"" a NYPD Internal Affairs representative said. The incident is the latest in a series of run-ins with the law for Bynes, who had a squeaky-clean image as a teen actress. Officers were called Thursday to her building in Manhattan's theater district after her building manager reported the 27-year-old was smoking an ""illegal substance"" in the lobby, police said. Bynes had headed back to her apartment by the time police arrived, but she let officers in when they knocked on the door, they said. Once inside, the officers noticed a bong and other marijuana paraphernalia sitting on a coffee table, which Bynes immediately started to throw out a window, police said. Police charged her with tampering with physical evidence, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of marijuana. The endangerment stems from the possibility that the tossed paraphernalia could have hit someone below. According to media reports, she appeared in court Friday and was then released until her next appearance in July. Taking to Twitter to make her case, Bynes said the police account is ""all lies."" Her story is that she was ""sexually harassed by one of the cops the night before last"" -- the same police officer who, she wrote, ended up arresting her. Bynes said she had opened her window ""for fresh air"" and didn't throw out any drug paraphernalia. She insisted the officer lied when he said she did. Then, she alleged of the officer in her apartment, ""He slapped my vagina. Sexual harassment. Big deal."" Bynes said she was handcuffed, ""which I resisted ... then I was sent to a mental hospital. Offensive."" ""The cop sexually harassed me, they found no pot on me or bong outside my window,"" Bynes tweeted. ""That's why the judge let me go."" Bynes has a DUI case pending in Southern California, while a pair of separate hit-and-run charges against her were dismissed late last year. Earlier this month, the actress was sentenced to three years' probation for driving on a suspended license. A young teenager when she burst on the scene as the lead in Nickelodeon's ""The Amanda Show,"" Bynes also starred alongside Jennie Garth in the sitcom ""What I Like About You."" She later scored roles in movies, including ""Hairspray"" and ""Easy A.""","Civilian witness says no one touched the actress ""inappropriately,"" NYPD says .

"London (CNN) -- Michael Adebowale, 22, has been charged with murder in the hacking death of British soldier Lee Rigby earlier this month on a London street, Metropolitan Police said late Wednesday. Adebowale will appear in court on Thursday. He was one of two people -- along with a 28-year-old man whom family, friends and acquaintances have identified as Michael Adebolajo -- arrested after being wounded in a confrontation with police after the May 22 attack. Adebolajo has not been formally charged. Adebowale was discharged from a hospital Tuesday and is now in custody at a police station, police said, while the 28-year-old remains hospitalized under guard. Adebowale also is charged with unlawful possession of a firearm. The killing of Rigby, who had served as an infantryman in Afghanistan and Cyprus, in the southeast London district of Woolwich shocked people across the United Kingdom. In all, 10 people have been arrested in connection with the killing. Two were released without charges, while six others have been freed on bail -- the most recent a 50-year-old man arrested Monday night on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. Rigby's fiancee, Aimee West, told Britain's Press Association on Wednesday night that she's ""extremely proud"" of him and ""devastated"" by his death. Her comments came in a statement to the news service issued through the Metropolitan Police; while police didn't relay that statement to CNN, they did confirm that they'd passed on West's remarks to the Press Association. ""I am moved by all the flowers and tributes, and that he has been remembered by the nation as the great man she was,"" West said of her ""loving fiancee.""","NEW: Lee Rigby's fiancee says she's ""devastated"" and ""moved"" by tributes to him .

"(CNN) -- Human error is to blame for a mortar round explosion that killed seven U.S. Marines and injured eight other service members during a training exercise in Nevada this year, the Marines said on Wednesday. An investigation of the March 18 incident at Hawthorne Army Depot revealed that ""the Marines employing one of the mortars did not follow correct procedures, resulting in the detonation of a high explosive round at the mortar position,"" the Marines said in a statement. ""The investigation also determined that the mortar section had not conducted appropriate preparatory training leading up to"" the nighttime training session, the Marines said. The mortar system itself functioned properly, the investigation determined. The Marines were killed when a 60mm mortar round exploded ""in the immediate vicinity"" of a firing position, the Marines said. Earlier this month, the Marines announced that three Marines were relieved of their duties after the incident. On Wednesday, the Marines said they were relieved because their commanding general ""lost trust and confidence in their ability to ensure proper preparation for, and conduct of, live fire training events."" No criminal charges are anticipated, the Marines said. Those relieved included Lt. Col. Andrew McNulty, the officer in charge of the killed Marines' infantry battalion -- 1st Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment. Also relieved were Capt. Kelby S. Breivogel, who commanded Company A, and Chief Warrant Officer-3 Douglas H. Derring, the battalion Marine infantry weapons officer. The Hawthorne Army Depot, about 140 miles southeast of Reno, is used for storing ammunition and weapon stocks awaiting demilitarization. The facility also provides high desert training facilities for military units. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","In March, seven Marines died during training exercise .

"(CNN) -- According to comScore's new Mobile Metrix 2.0 report released Monday, Facebook's mobile usage is on the rise. In fact, the report revealed that Facebook users spent more time accessing the social network on smartphones than on computers in March. Facebook users spent an average of 441 minutes — or 7 hours, 21 minutes — accessing the social network via smartphones during the month. By comparison, users spent 391 minutes — or 6 hours, 31 minutes — checking out Facebook on PCs. The comScore report also revealed that smartphone users spent more time on Facebook than on any other social media network, including Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest and Foursquare. In fact, Facebook is the second largest mobile property behind Google. The social network garners more than 78 million unique monthly smartphone visitors, 81 percent of which access Facebook through its mobile app. Besides showing that people spend a good chunk of time on Facebook, the data underscores the importance of a mobile strategy for the social network's business success. Facebook currently makes little revenue from its mobile app — the app doesn't include ads, and only started to include ""sponsored posts"" in users' news feeds last March. Facebook admitted its mobile struggles in its recent IPO documents. ""If users increasingly access mobile products as a substitute for access through personal computers, and if we are unable to successfully implement monetization strategies for our mobile users,"" the company writes in its filing documents, ""our financial performance and ability to grow revenue would be negatively affected."" In light of these stats, a Facebook smartphone makes all the more sense. The company could capitalize on its mobile leadership position. But because Facebook has not officially made any announcements about its hardware plans, it's unclear when a Facebook phone will actually enter the market.

"(CNN) -- Robert Barchi believed he had much more important business to deal with at Rutgers, and in many ways, he's probably right. He is overseeing a massive merger between the university and the state's medical schools, one that will shape higher education in New Jersey for generations. But now there was an issue involving a videotape of his basketball coach. This was early December, just after Rutgers had received a much-celebrated invitation to the Big Ten Conference. The tape contained clips of Mike Rice throwing basketballs at his players, shoving them and cursing at them, and using a homophobic slur. When it was given to ESPN months later, it dominated the airwaves for a week and sparked a scandal that rocked the Rutgers athletic department and, for many alums, disgraced the school. The tape was toxic. The tape overshadowed everything Barchi was trying to accomplish on the New Brunswick, New Jersey, campus. But he never watched that tape until after it aired. ""It was a revelation,"" Barchi said a few weeks later, ""that the intensity of the response, both within the community, within the state and nationally on this very important and very serious issue could totally swamp out all of the other issues we're trying to deal with and color everything else we're doing."" Revelation isn't the right word. Reality is. Barchi isn't the first university president -- and he won't be the last -- to learn how a scandal in college athletics can shape his administration or, for some, end it entirely. That's what happened at Penn State when Graham Spanier was forced to resign in November 2011 after his weak response to the scandal involving former football coach Jerry Sandusky. Sandusky was arrested and charged with 52 counts of sexual abuse of young boys. As another Big Ten school, Ohio State, dealt with an NCAA scandal involving rules violations with its longtime coach Jim Tressel, university President Gordon Gee was asked if he considered making a change in his football program. He famously responded, ""I'm just hoping the coach doesn't dismiss me,"" a one-liner he came to regret when Tressel was later forced to resign. What happened at Rutgers was nowhere close to those levels. Still, it should serve as a reminder to all college presidents that sports, while a small part of the university mission as a whole, are a huge factor in shaping the public image of a school and dominate media attention. Barchi went from a mostly anonymous administrator, an acclaimed neuroscientist who became the 20th president at Rutgers during an important time in its history, to an embattled leader listening to calls for his dismissal from sports columnists, politicians and faculty. That, he admitted, was frustrating. ""I guess I learned that this is one area that I have to be involved with process right from the beginning,"" he said, ""that I have to understand that the processes are in place and being followed from the beginning and not assume that they're in place, and I have to be fully sensitive to the multiplier and how easily the game knob gets turned up on this, and spillover on everything else we're trying to do."" It was a lesson he kept learning. Barchi fired Rice and forced out athletic director Tim Pernetti. He promised a thorough background check on his choices to replace both men but then was further embarrassed when the website Deadspin.com uncovered that new basketball coach Eddie Jordan did not have a degree from the university, as his official bio claimed. That was small potatoes in comparison to the story that broke involving his new athletic director. Julie Hermann had promised a ""new day"" when she was hired in April, vowing that ""there's no one that doesn't agree about how we treat young people with respect and dignity and build trust"" at Rutgers. But she had, herself, been an abusive coach at Tennessee, according to a dozen former players interviewed by The Star-Ledger, accused of many of same things that got Rice fired. Hermann countered that, while she was a ""super intense"" coach, she was never abusive. Then, two days later, The New York Times first reported that Hermann was at the center of a sex discrimination suit at Louisville, where she worked for 16 years as a senior administrator. A jury initially awarded $300,000 to an assistant track coach in the case, but a Kentucky appeals court later overturned the verdict. Barchi received a vote of confidence from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who declared that hiring Hermann was ""not my call"" and that he was ""confident in President Barchi's judgment"" on his weekly radio show. But how could Rutgers hire anyone with a questionable coaching background after the Rice debacle? And how did the university fail to contact any of these former players through what was supposed to be a thorough vetting process? The story again painted Rutgers as a laughingstock. The headline on ESPN.com late Tuesday declared, ""Rutgers back to being a punchline,"" while SI.com wondered, ""Does Rutgers even know how to run an athletic department?"" The real question: How did Barchi fail to understand the reach of a college athletics scandal? The university president, like many before him on other campuses, found out the hard way. ""I regret that I did not ask to see this video,"" Barchi said when the Rice scandal broke. The satellite trucks were lined up in front of his office, and much to his chagrin, nobody wanted to talk about that historic merger with the medical schools. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Politi.","Steve Politi: How could Rutgers hire anyone with a questionable coaching background?

"(CNN) -- Police in Omaha, Nebraska, said Thursday that they're looking into whether there's a connection between the recent killings of a university professor and his wife and two unsolved area homicides. Roger and Mary Brumback, both 65, were found dead at their home early Tuesday by officers responding to a welfare call. Police are saying little else about the case. They do not plan to release additional information, police said, in order to protect the investigation, which is being led by a homicide unit. However, they have said a cold case unit is assisting to determine whether there is a connection between the case and the unsolved killings of Shirlee Sherman and Thomas Hunter. According to CNN affiliate KETV, 11-year-old Hunter and Sherman, the family's housekeeper, were killed in March 2008. ""When I heard the news last night, I was literally shaken -- literally,"" Laura Neece-Baltaro, a family friend of the Brumbacks, told KETV. She met them when they all lived in Oklahoma in the 1990s. ""Why would anyone want to harm them? They did so much for the community here, and the community in Oklahoma City and they were still contributing. They still had a lot to give back,"" she said. ""It's a terrible loss to the whole world that they're no longer with us."" Roger Brumback was a professor at Creighton University. According to the school's website, he attended Pennsylvania State University and worked in the pathology and neurology departments.

The results also will appear when Google users search for a local site using Google search or Google Maps. Companies listed on the less-social Google Places can be converted over to Google Plus. According to the blog Search Engine Land, roughly 80 million businesses' pages already had been converted Wednesday morning. Google Plus reports being up to about 100 million users since opening to the public in September. That's a far cry from Facebook's roughly 900 million accounts. Some in the tech world were saying Wednesday that Google Plus Local might be a way to begin catching up. ""What Google still lacks in Google+ is a way of getting different businesses' networks to interact with each other -- meaning, Facebook may have its own Facebook Places, but it also has a range of apps from others, like Gogobot and more, that enhance that experience,"" wrote Ingrid Lunden of TechCrunch.

"(CNN) -- Donna Summer, the ""Queen of Disco"" whose hits included ""Hot Stuff,"" ""Bad Girls,"" ""Love to Love You Baby"" and ""She Works Hard for the Money,"" has died, a representative said Thursday. She was 63. Her publicist, Brian Edwards, said Summer was suffering from cancer. She died surrounded by her family in Florida, he said. ""Early this morning, we lost Donna Summer Sudano, a woman of many gifts, the greatest being her faith,"" a family statement said. ""While we grieve her passing, we are at peace celebrating her extraordinary life and her continued legacy. Words truly can't express how much we appreciate your prayers and love for our family at this sensitive time."" Summer first rose to fame the mid-'70s, thanks to ""Love to Love You Baby."" The song, with Summer's whispered vocals and orgasmic groans helped define the mid-'70s disco trend and hit No. 2 in 1976. Summer followed the song with such hits as ""I Feel Love,"" ""Last Dance"" and a disco-fied version of the Richard Harris hit ""MacArthur Park,"" which outdid Harris' version by hitting No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart. It was Summer's first of four chart-toppers. Fans, friends react to Summer's death . But with her 1979 album ""Bad Girls,"" Summer broke out of the disco mold as the genre, which had become renewed by the success of the ""Saturday Night Fever"" soundtrack, was feeling a backlash. ""Bad Girls"" demonstrated Summer's vocal and stylistic range and produced two No. 1 hits, ""Hot Stuff"" and ""Bad Girls,"" as well as a Top 10 ballad, ""Dim All the Lights."" However, Summer had some trouble adjusting to the changing times. Her next album, ""The Wanderer,"" went for more of a rock feel. It produced a Top 10 hit in the title track but fared relatively poorly on the charts -- especially after the success of ""Bad Girls,"" a double album that spent five weeks at No. 1. It wasn't until 1983's ""She Works Hard for the Money,"" which became a ubiquitous video as well as a big radio hit, that Summer's fame approached its late '70s zenith.

""Her talent was a true gift to the music industry, and our thoughts and sympathies are with her family, friends and fans throughout the world during this difficult time."" ""I don't like to be categorized because I think that I am an instrument, and if you play me, I'll make whatever particular sound is supposed to come out for that color,"" Summer told CNN in a 2008 interview. ""And so, in the overall spectrum of things, I'm just trying to be true to my -- what I feel my mission is.""

"(EW.com) -- Over the past few years, Zachary Quinto has established his acting rep by playing Sylar in ""Heroes,"" a couple of memorable roles on ""American Horror Story,"" and, of course, Spock in the last two ""Star Trek"" movies. So you could describe his transition into producing as, well, ""logical."" Certainly it has gotten off to an encouraging start. Quinto produced director J.C. Chandor's financial crisis movie Margin Call through the actor's Before the Door company — the production outfit he runs with partners Corey Moosa and Neal Dodson — and exec produced Chandor's Robert Redford-starring ""All Is Lost,"" which just screened at Cannes. Through Behind the Door, Quinto has also produced the new film ""Breakup at a Wedding,"" a nuptials-themed comedy which is told through the lenses of the wedding videographers. Directed by Victor Quinaz and starring Quinaz's brother Philip and Alison Fyhrie as the engaged couple this tale of a big-day-which-goes-horribly-awry is available on VOD from June 18. Below, Quinto talks about ""Breakup at a Wedding"" and, below that, you can exclusively check out the movie's new poster here which was created by Tom Hodge (the designer responsible for the similarly eye-catching posters for The Innkeepers and Hobo With a Shotgun). Entertainment Weekly: I'm guessing you're kind of happy to be talking about something which doesn't involve spaceships. Zachary Quinto: Well, I've been having a great time talking about all that stuff, too. No complaints! But it's always good to promote other projects that I have going on. The great thing about this movie is that it really is a friends and family situation. We've known Victor and Anna (Martemucci, who cowrote the film with the Quinaz brothers) for years. And to be able to give them this opportunity and to bring all the other collaborators that they work with on a regular basis into the equation was really gratifying for us. One of our main tenets is providing opportnities for people that we've loved and have inspired us for a long time and Victor and Anna are certainly among them. EW: The wedding comedy is well-tilled ground. What attracted you to the project? Quinto: One of the other things that we're really focused on at my production company is innovative storytelling, whether that means the story itself or the style in which the story is told. In this case, we felt like, yes, the wedding comedy has definitely been done and done very well by other people already. But what we felt was fascinating about this script was taking the found footage mode — that tends to be reserved for more horror, thriller, genre projects — and applying it to this more traditional romantic comedy. We're really excited to be working with Oscilloscope and obviously this poster that they've done up which is so incredible, to see all the faces of all of our friends in that kind of high art rendering, it's really gratifying. It's been all-round a really good experience and on the heels of everything else that I have going on. EW: This film is different in almost every imaginable way from Margin Call. Was it a similarly different experience in terms of producing it? Or were many of the challenges and problems the same? Quinto: It was very different to produce this, just simply based on the budget. I mean, Margin Call was about a $3.5M film and this is a half of a million dollar film. So we had less resources and less time. It was also different because it was our friends and literally their family—you know, Victor and Phil are brothers and Victor's mom is in the movie and Anna's mom is in the movie. It really was a friends and family affair. We had a lot of good times while making it but we basically holed ourselves up in a hotel out by JFK and just were there for pretty much two weeks banging away all hours and shooting multiple pages a day. It was definitely a brisk experience but luckily the style of the film allowed for that to happen. It was really fun, but definitely a brief encounter. EW: Did making this movie alter your own views on marriage at all? Quinto: [Laughs] Um...No. I think there's a tremendous amount of heart in the film and I think the journey that Phil and Alison take in the movie is one that is very relatable in terms of people entering into that institution. But I would say my views on marriage are ambivalent at best anyway so I feel like it's just sort of kept me in that same space. EW: What's the one practical lesson you've learned as a producer? Quinto: Not to sit in meetings where they're talking about actors and actors' value. There are certainly things I've learned as a producer that no actor should ever know. And the way that we are talked about in financing meetings and casting meetings is one of them. So I recuse myself of those conversations with financiers until my business partners are able to handle that part of it and then I come in. EW: When you say the ""value"" of actors you mean their actual financial value to a project? Quinto: Yeah. You know, we all have a number attached to our name and that number is different domestically than it is internationally. It's different in different territories and financiers really do break it down by those kind of metrics. It's horrible because you're talking about people and you're talking about talented people and to hear them talked about in such a broad and impersonal way can be really disappointing. EW: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I feel like we've all got a number by our names one way or another. Yeah, you're right. I guess that's true. It doesn't make me feel any better.

"(CNN) -- In nearly nine hours in detention at London's Heathrow Airport, David Miranda -- the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald -- said he didn't trust the British authorities questioning him, fearing they'd follow through on threats to throw him in jail, if not worse. ""I have seen many stories that people are picked up in different countries ... and they are vanished, nobody sees them,"" Miranda said Tuesday in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""In that moment, I was really afraid what would happen to me."" The Brazilian national said he didn't know what he might have done wrong, why the UK government's anti-terrorism laws applied to him, or why he couldn't have a lawyer of his choosing present. But he did understand why his partner might be a target. Greenwald has been at the forefront of high-profile reports exposing secrets in U.S. intelligence programs, stories that have made him a thorn in the side of Washington and some of its allies. Greenwald, with the cooperation of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, broke the story of the existence of a U.S. National Security Agency program that is thought to have collected large amounts of phone and Internet data. Miranda's detention ended only after a lawyer from Greenwald's news organization, the British-based Guardian, got the chance to talk to him after about eight hours. After that, the 28-year-old was released, without materials he'd been carrying on behalf of Greenwald, to pass onto a filmmaker in Berlin. He said officials also confiscated his laptop, phone and USB sticks. Miranda ultimately returned to Brazil, where he lives with Greenwald. Sitting alongside his partner, Greenwald said the detention gave the British government ""a huge black eye in the world, (made) them look thuggish and authoritarian (for) interfering in the journalism process (and created) international incidents with the government of Brazil, which is indignant about this."" The action has prompted a lawsuit asking British courts to declare what happened to Miranda illegal because his detention was unrelated to terrorism, Greenwald said. The journalist added the lawsuit also demands that all the items taken from Miranda be returned to him, and that the British government can't first use or share them with anyone else. ""To start detaining people who they think they are reporting on what they're doing under terrorism laws, that is as dangerous and oppressive as it gets,"" Greenwald said. White House knew Miranda would be detained . Britain's Home Office on Tuesday defended Miranda's questioning, saying the government and police ""have a duty to protect the public and our national security."" ""If the police believe that an individual is in possession of highly sensitive stolen information that would help terrorism, then they should act and the law provides them with a framework to do that,"" it said. ""Those who oppose this sort of action need to think about what they are condoning."" Questioning was under Terrorism Act 2000 . The British government and Miranda say he was questioned on Sunday under Schedule 7 of Terrorism Act 2000, which gives authorities more powers to investigate and combat terrorism, though not without some controversy. In a statement that didn't name Miranda but referred to his detention, London's Metropolitan Police called what happened ""legally and procedurally sound"" and said it came after ""a detailed decision-making process."" The statement describes the law under which Miranda was detained as ""a key part of our national security capability which is used regularly and carefully by the Metropolitan Police Service to help keep the public safe."" But that's not how Miranda and Greenwald view the law, or at least how it was applied in this case. Said Miranda, for whom English is a second language and who didn't have an interpreter on hand throughout the ordeal: ""They didn't ask me anything about terrorism, not one question."" ""They were just telling me: 'If you don't answer this, you are going to jail,' "" he added. Greenwald said he learned three hours into the incident that his partner was being detained, and he added that concerned Brazilian diplomats and Guardian lawyers were shut out of the process for hours. Greenwald: UK authorities trying to intimidate journalists . The entire episode, Greenwald speculated, was designed to intimidate him and other investigative journalists from using classified information and digging into stories critical of the British and allied governments. His newspaper's editor, Alan Rusbridger, detailed in an editorial published late Monday meetings with UK government officials and ""shadowy Whitehall figures"" in connection with Greenwald's reporting. ""The demand was the same: Hand the Snowden material back or destroy it,"" he said. Otherwise, the government would pursue legal action to force its surrender, he said he was told. These efforts, including Miranda's detention, are a threat not just to the Guardian, but all journalists, Greenwald said. ""What you're essentially doing is saying that journalism is not only a crime, but now it's actually terrorism,"" he said. ""It's an extremely dangerous precedent. They clearly abused their own law."" As to how what happened will affect his own work, Greenwald said he's more committed than ever to expose governments' abuse of their powers. ""We are absolutely going to continue to publish and, if anything, this has emboldened me,"" he said. CNN's Bryony Jones and Caroline Paterson contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- A map of significant climate events for the United States in June looks almost apocalyptic: hellish heat, ferocious fires and severe storms leaving people injured, homeless and even dead. Why to expect more weather disasters . That followed a warm winter and early season droughts. News came Monday that the mainland United States experienced its warmest 12 months since the dawn of record-keeping in 1895. And on Tuesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released a report calling 2011 a year of extreme weather. Wildfire victims face second tragedy . Remember Hurricane Irene? Or the floods in Thailand and southern China and the deadly drought in the Horn of Africa? Heavy rains in Brazil caused massive landslides and much of Europe suffered through a sweltering heatwave. It's tempting to simplify things and blame it all on global warming. After all, nine of the top 10 warmest years globally have occurred since 2000, according to NOAA. But weather can be complicated. The real challenge is figuring out whether a particular storm or flood was due to climate change or natural variables, said Chris Field, founding director of the Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology. The NOAA report, for instance, noted some events that were exacerbated by other factors. However, climate change increases global risks, Field said. ""As we change the climate, we're shifting the odds for extreme weather,"" he said. Photos: Extreme heat strikes U.S. It's sort of like upping your chances of a car accident if you're speeding. The four classes of extremes -- high heat, heavy precipitation and floods, duration and intensity of droughts and extremes related to higher sea levels -- have changed in the last 50 years, Field said. ""Increasingly, we are loading the dice towards these very damaging kinds of extremes,"" he said. But that's not to say every weather event is related to warming temperatures. Southern Greenland, northern Russia, and the eastern two-thirds of North America have felt the greatest warmth in 2012, but many places -- Alaska, Mongolia and most of Australia -- have been cool anomalies. Russia declares day of mourning for flood victims . The men's final at the Wimbledon tennis tournament Sunday was stopped briefly for rain. Rain, in Britain? Although it has a reputation for sogginess, it's been cooler and wetter than normal for the last few months in the British isles. America's northwest has also escaped the heat. The state of Washington just marked its seventh coolest June ever. ""When you've got a planet that's nearest warmest levels on record, that doesn't mean every part of the world is going to be the warmest ever,"" said Jeff Masters, director of meteorology for Weather Underground. ""The U.S. has been unlucky enough to be in that sort of pattern,"" he said. Jake Crouch, a climate scientist at the National Climatic Data Center, said weather patterns -- including the jet stream or the ocean-atmosphere systems in the Pacific known as El Niño and La Niña -- have a great effect on weather. In 2011, two back-to-back La Niñas, each characterized by cooler-than-average water temperatures in the eastern Pacific, affected significant weather events -- including droughts in the southern United States and northern Mexico and in east Africa. There is debate over how climate change affects such weather patterns but the NOAA-led ""state of the climate"" report said La Niña-related heat waves are now 20 times more likely to occur than 50 years ago. Scientists also analyzed the United Kingdom's very warm November 2011 and a very cold December 2010. They said that cold Decembers are now half as likely to occur versus 50 years ago, whereas warm Novembers are now 62 times more likely. The report pointed out that some weather events, like the Thailand flooding, are influenced by humans in other ways. Photos: Finding beauty in violent storms . ""Although the flooding was unprecedented, the amount of rain that fell in the river 'catchment' area was not very unusual,"" the report said. ""Other factors, such as changes in reservoir policies and increased construction on the flood plain, were found most relevant in setting the scale of the disaster."" The 2012 hurricane season has gotten off to a robust start, though meteorologist Thomas Downs of Expert Weather Investigations attributed that to a cyclical warming of Atlantic waters. ""We've had a tremendous start to the system. We are in the middle of a warm phase,"" he said. Hurricane Andrew in 1992 was devastating, but it was also the first named storm of that year -- in August. By contrast, this year, the United States has already lived through four named storms -- two in May and two in June. The last was Tropical Storm Debby, which flooded Florida. The warmer waters can lead to warmer temperatures on land, Downs said. So can extended drought. ""The biggest thing of this year is the cumulative effect of the last two seasons. Some parts of the United States have been under drought conditions for the past two years,"" he said, and did not have much rain in April and May. Less solar energy is absorbed by hot, parched land. ""The drought amplifies temperatures -- 90 becomes 100. 100 becomes 105."" ""The reality is when you do have extreme weather, it is highlighted,"" Downs said. ""People want to attribute it to one factor or another."" The other reality is that Americans and others will likely be paying a lot more for cereal, sweeteners and meat as the price of corn goes up because of failed crops. ""The crops are hurting,"" said Chad Hart, a grain market specialist at Iowa State University. The eastern part of the Corn Belt is especially hard-hit. In states like Iowa, farmers are in the critical stage of corn pollination. ""We need a good inch of moisture this week,"" Hart said. ""And there's no rain in the forecast. ""That means we are looking for a much lower yield for crops we produce in the Midwest."" Northwest heat endangers crops . That means farmers will be devastated and consumers could see higher prices at the grocery store for corn, soy and wheat products, as well as meat from animals raised on corn feed. They will also be paying more to utility companies for running air-conditioners as the sizzling summer continues. ""In July, August and September, there's an above-average chance of warmer-than-average temperatures,"" Crouch said. The hottest year on record for the United States is 1998. Crouch said 2012 is on track to beat it. Perhaps people should get used to hotter temperatures, experts say, because the trends point that way. A heatwave that occurred every 20 years will, by the year 2080, occur every one to two years, Field said. Think it's hot? Imagine living here . The extreme weather the world is seeing now is a precursor to more, he said. And it paints a picture of what global warming looks like. ""There are a lot of steps that can be taken to prepare people for climate extremes,"" he said. ""It's kind of a situation that warrants very serious thought."" In releasing the state of the climate report Tuesday, Deputy NOAA Administrator Kathryn Sullivan said 2011 will be remembered for extreme weather. This year seems to be on the same track. From now on, she said, every weather event takes place in the context of a changing global environment. Heat affecting your area? Share your photos and videos with us on CNN iReport.

"Washington (CNN) -- A prominent conservative legal advocacy group sued top Internal Revenue Service and Obama administration officials on Wednesday, claiming the constitutional rights of 25 organizations were violated when the IRS targeted conservative outfits seeking tax-exempt status. The Washington-based American Center for Law and Justice argued in a federal district court filing that the organizations' First Amendment free speech rights and Fifth Amendment due process rights were violated, among other things. The group also contends that the IRS violated its own regulations. The filing by the ACLJ -- founded by televangelist Pat Robertson -- asks the court to rule that Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, former IRS Commissioner Steven Miller, IRS Director of Exempt Organizations Lois Lerner, and IRS official Holly Paz all acted unlawfully. In addition, the lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages against Miller, Lerner and Paz for ""implementing, directing, and overseeing the unconstitutional conduct."" It asks the court to force the immediate granting of tax-exempt status to several groups still waiting for the IRS to act on their applications. ""The overreach by the Internal Revenue Service is not only extremely disturbing but it is unconstitutional as well,"" ACLJ Chief Counsel Jay Sekulow said. ""An out-of-control IRS is problematic on a number of fronts, but this ongoing scheme to target conservative organizations is unlawful and represents a serious breach of trust for the American people,"" he added. ""The federal lawsuit is significant and is intended to bring an end to this ploy of intimidation and hold those responsible inside the Obama administration accountable."" Multiple congressional panels are currently investigating the targeting. The Justice Department has also launched an investigation of whether laws were broken by IRS workers using a list of criteria including names such as ""tea party"" to determine levels of scrutiny for groups seeking tax-exempt status. Other groups have also filed or plan to file related suits against the IRS.

"Madrid (CNN) -- When Marco Torremocha was laid off last year as a health and safety technician on construction sites -- another victim of Spain's deep economic crisis -- he wanted to put his severance pay into a sound investment. An American friend entrepreneur living in Madrid, Phillip Stark, had a little idea: Earplugs. Now, the pair who met while playing in very loud rock bands -- Marco on guitar and Phil on bass -- have a business that seems almost unheard of in Spain. They sell earplugs at rock concerts, nightclubs, even rehearsal studios. ""Many people who are unemployed in Spain,"" says Torremocha, referring to the six million without jobs, ""don't have anything to invest."" But he did, thanks to severance pay after 11 years on construction sites, following the bust of the real estate boom -- a big part of Spain's financial crisis. ""You work for a private company and now you think broader,"" he said, explaining that he risked 2,000 euros [$2,600] -- a small portion of his severance pay -- as seed money for the earplug business. Stark didn't have any startup cash. But he seems to have marketing in his DNA -- his family has a clothing store business in his native Ohio -- and he'd previously tried other ventures in Madrid, including a tourism magazine, that flopped. COMPLETE COVERAGE: Marketplace Europe . But this time, Stark says, ""failure is not an option. I get frustrated with people who say 'can't.' I hate hearing people be negative."" Both men complain they've been exposed to loud music without hearing protection and sometimes have low-level ringing in their ears long after the concerts are done. Their earplugs are called Stark Plugs. They went on sale late last year at a few locales in Madrid, gradually adding more sites. But this weekend they're reporting a huge leap forward, with hundreds of sales daily at the big Primavera Sound music festival in Barcelona. The earplugs are dispensed from vending machines. For two euros [$2.60], you get two yellow earplugs, made from a soft, foam-like thermoplastic polymer called Goma EVA. They come in a tiny clear plastic case that fits easily in your pocket. They brought five vending machines to the festival, and Stark wrote in an email on Friday: ""Next year we should definitely take fifty machines and put them everywhere."" READ, WATCH: Croatia president on the country's future in oil . Some of the buyers in Barcelona, Stark added, are concert photographers who must stay long hours exposed to the loud music. In Madrid, Wurlitzer Ballroom, a small nightclub just off Madrid's Gran Via street, was one of the first places to sell Stark Plugs. Manager Alvaro Villacis said the earplug machine is a novelty -- for his club and many others in Spain. Most of his 15-member staff already use them for protection, including himself. ""I don't want to go deaf,"" Villacis said. On a night that I visited in May, a band called Trono de Sangre (Blood Throne) was playing at top decibel. I quickly inserted a pair of Stark Plugs, which instantly damped dow the sound to a more palatable level, although even at lower volume, I wouldn't count myself as a fan of Blood Throne's shock and screaming style. Amalio Varela, a radio sound technician, was right up front during the Wurlitzer show with his girlfriend, and told me during a break, outside, that he's used Stark Plugs and likes the idea. ""If you forget your own, you can buy them for two euros,"" right in the club, he said. READ MORE: How a very British oven maker wants to reinvent itself . Exactly how much protection the earplugs offer is open to debate, says Peter Cobo, a researcher at an acoustics center of the Spanish government's Higher Council for Scientific Research, (CSIC), who has not seen Stark Plugs. Cobo says Spain has a law on general ambient noise that lists 65 decibels as the level where it becomes potentially annoying, and also separate legislation requiring corrective action when workplace noise, such as at a factory, exceeds 80 decibels. Cobo says a rock concert can easily exceed 100 decibels and that earplugs, depending on their quality and how well they are placed in the ear, probably could reduce the sound by 20 decibels or more. Torremocha and Stark aim to expand quickly. They've put advertising on their vending machines and even on the tiny earplug plastic case, along with marketing schemes using mobile phone codes to direct consumers to web sites to view more products. READ MORE: Luxury brand favors quality over speed . And they've already added so-called ""high-end"" earplugs to their lineup, from an American company called Ear Peace, which is trying to break into the European market, with Torremocha and Stark as new sales representatives. Ear Peace plugs sell for about 15 euros [$19.65] at concerts in Spain. You get three earplugs made of soft, hypoallergenic silicone, with tiny filters to temper the sound, and a small cylindrical aluminum carrying case that fits on a key ring. Stark said the Ear Peace plugs were also selling well at Primavera Sound in Barcelona from merchandising stands, but not as briskly as the less-expensive Stark Plugs. Coins dropping into their vending machines is a sound Stark and Torremocha would like to get used to.","Marco Torremocha and Phillip Stark are running an unusual business in Spain .

"(CNN) -- A Florida mother shot her four children early Tuesday morning before turning the gun on herself at her home in Port St. John, police said. A neighbor heard shots at 4:50 a.m. and then responded to a knock at the door to find three of the children, police said. The three children went to the neighbor's house to say their mother had shot them, Brevard County Sheriff's Office Lt. Tod Goodyear said, according to CNN affiliate WKMG. The mother, Tonya Thomas, 33, then called them back home, Brevard County Sheriff's Office Lt. Tod Goodyear told reporters. The mother then shot them again, killing them, Goodyear said, according to WKMG. ""I'm a father and I've got kids. I cannot comprehend a person doing that to their child -- calling them back to the slaughter,"" Goodyear said, according to WKMG. Responding deputies arrived at the house and heard shots. They discovered Thomas' eldest daughter, Pebbles Johnson, 17, wounded in the front yard. They drove a patrol car onto the lawn in an attempt to rescue her. Johnson was rushed to a hospital but died from her wounds, Goodyear said. The other children -- Joel Johnson, 12, Jazlin Johnson, 13, and Jaxs Johnson,15 -- were all dead, as was Thomas. No suicide note was found in the home, but Goodyear said a witness told police he received a text from Thomas about 3 a.m. that said she wanted to be cremated with the children. ""Unfortunately he did not see that text or read it on his phone until he woke up this morning ... well after the incident occurred,"" Goodyear said. The children's father does not live with the family and Goodyear said he was distraught. Goodyear said police do not have a motive. He said authorities have received previous calls from Thomas' home pertaining to domestic violence. Goodyear said he was having a hard time trying to understand how a mother could commit such a grisly act. He said she remained very calm when she called the children back to their house. ""I cannot comprehend as a parent doing this to their children ... calling them back in and shooting them,"" he said. He said authorities have not yet determined the owner of the gun but they believe Thomas was the killer.

"(CNN) -- A skateboard may have saved a man from being the lunch of a hungry cougar in a Canadian resort town last week. The big cat jumped the man from behind while he was walking with a skateboard along a dirt path through woods in Banff, Alberta, on Thursday, according to Bill Hunt, a Parks Canada field unit manager. ""He hit the animal with the skateboard and stunned him,"" Hunt said. The man, who is in his mid-20s, was listening to music through earbuds. His jacket hood was pulled over his head, Hunt said, possibly making him look inviting to a cat that is stimulated by motion. It was unclear why the man, who asked to remain anonymous, was carrying a skateboard on a wooded path while it was sleeting, Hunt said. Cougar attacks on people are rare because the cats are ""very wary of people,"" Hunt said. The use of a skateboard to defend against a cougar is even more rare, he said. ""The last time we had an attack on a human was two years ago, then several years before that,"" he said. The search is on for the cougar because the summer camping season is beginning in Banff, a town nestled in Alberta's Rockies. A section of the town's northern outskirts is closed to hikers and skateboarders until the cat is found and relocated, Hunt said. Cougar hounds and their handlers were scouring the forested area Monday for signs of the cat, while others monitor cameras along hiking trails, he said. ""It's either a young animal who has not learned how to hunt or an older animal in poor health, injured or with a broken tooth that's going after domestic animals near town,"" he said. The plan is to use a dart gun to anesthetize the cougar. If it is healthy, it could be relocated away from the town, Hunt said. Cougars, wolves and bears are normally steered to wildlife corridors that surround Banff, he said. Early settlers who built Banff honored the animals they displaced by named nearly every street after them. Skateboarders can safely roll down Cougar Street, Wolverine Street, Lynx Street, Grizzly Street, Mountain Goat Lane and Porcupine Place. UK zoo worker dies after being mauled by tiger .

"(CNN) -- Rape is a crime in which, all too often, only the victim pays a price. In America, out of every 100 rapes, only 46 are reported to police and only three rapists will spend a day behind bars. To make matters worse, rapists tend to be serial criminals, so every one left on the streets is likely to commit still more attacks. On Monday, in a big win for public safety and for victims of sexual violence, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a decision in Maryland v. King, a decision that will have a big impact on our nation's ability to hold rapists accountable. Following his arrest on assault charges in 2009, Alonzo King had his cheek swabbed, a painless five-second process, one that Justice Anthony Kennedy in his majority opinion characterized as ""a minor intrusion."" A crime lab analyzed the swab, and the resulting DNA profile was entered into the Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS, the federal database. King's DNA was linked to a 6-year-old crime scene, and he was subsequently convicted for the rape of a 53-year-old woman at gunpoint. CODIS, by the way, contains the DNA profiles of more than 10 million offenders, as well as a record of DNA left at nearly half a million crime scenes. It has produced more than 205,000 hits so far, DNA matches between offender and crime scene, which has aided more than 197,000 investigations. In other words, it works, and without it, King and many other rapists would remain free to commit more crimes. King appealed his conviction and a Maryland court overturned it. Maryland is one of 26 states that treat DNA as essentially a more sophisticated and accurate version of fingerprints, collecting it after someone is arrested on certain felony charges. The remaining states wait until a conviction to collect DNA. The Maryland court ruled that collecting DNA from arrestees was a Fourth Amendment violation; the state appealed that decision to the Supreme Court, which ruled on Monday. During oral arguments, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. described this case as ""perhaps the most important criminal procedure case that this court has heard in decades."" He's right, and the decision will have profound positive benefits for victims of rape and their families seeking justice. DNA is the fingerprint of the 21st century, and it is long established that police can collect fingerprints upon an arrest and check to see if those prints match an unsolved case. Take, for example, Katie Sepich, a 22-year-old graduate student at New Mexico State University. In August 2003, she was raped and strangled just outside her home; her body was burned and abandoned at a dump site. In 2006, the DNA gathered from under Katie's fingernails was matched to a man who, in the years since, had been convicted of several other crimes. He was convicted of her rape and murder. Opponents of collecting DNA from people arrested for felonies are right to fear a massive government database that contains intimate DNA information about citizens' genetic and health histories. But that's not what CODIS is. In fact, CODIS doesn't even contain an individual's DNA profile. It contains only 13 genetic markers, known as ""junk markers,"" that were specifically chosen because they are not correlated to any physical or medical traits. Essentially, the markers used can only reveal the identity of a person and nothing else, just like fingerprinting. Kennedy, in the majority opinion, maintained that using DNA for identification purposes is ""a legitimate booking procedure"" and no different than ""matching tattoos to known gang symbols to reveal a criminal affiliation; or matching the arrestee's fingerprints to those recovered from a crime scene."" Fears that CODIS could be hacked, and DNA profiles used for nefarious purposes, also don't stand up to the evidence. First, accessing the database for non-law enforcement purposes is a serious crime, and one that has never happened. Second, even if the database were accessed improperly, there's nothing in it other than those 13 DNA markers. The names of the people to whom the DNA profiles belong aren't stored in the database. Rather, once there's a hit, law enforcement contacts the jurisdiction that uploaded that profile to find out to whom it belongs. It's an extra level of protection that makes it pointless to even try to break in. A cheek swab, which is quicker than fingerprinting and leaves no inky residue, is less invasive than what suspects frequently experience upon arrest: frisking, handcuffing and even strip-searches. While in prison, suspects are observed by other inmates and uniformed officers sleeping, eating and even going to the bathroom. Tens of thousands of criminals are in prison today thanks to DNA, which has proven to be a detective's most valuable tool in our country's fight against sexual violence. Thanks to the decision by the Supreme Court overturning the Maryland decision, this tool remains available to law enforcement. They, and we, need it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Scott Berkowitz.","Scott Berkowitz: Supreme Court rules cops can take DNA swab when there's serious crime .

"Washington (CNN) -- Every spring, when West Yellowstone Airport in Montana opens for the season, the TSA flies in six people to staff the airport's one-lane security checkpoint. Every fall, it flies the screeners home. All of that will soon change. The TSA said Monday it will allow the state-owned airport to hire a private company to conduct the TSA screening, making those six screener jobs available to local residents and, quite possibly, saving the federal government money. Locally hired screeners cost half as much as flown-in screeners, because the government doesn't have to pay for travel, per diem and housing, according to a 2008 report by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General. That came to $219 a day, versus $511 per day, in 2005, the year cited in the report. But the TSA's decision to allow West Yellowstone to privatize its security workforce is a rare concession these days. The TSA simultaneously rejected requests to privatize screening at two other airports: Bert Mooney Airport, also in Montana, and Orlando Sanford International Airport in Florida. TSA Administrator John Pistole one year ago put the brakes on the government's privatization program, saying he would approve contract security only if airports could demonstrate it would not hurt security and if there was a ""clear and substantial"" advantage to the federal government. Pistole's action demonstrated his philosophy that protecting aviation is a federal government responsibility, and that privatizing the workforce can decrease his flexibility to move screeners between airports in response to threats. Not everyone agrees. On Tuesday, a House Homeland Security subcommittee will take up the question of whether airport security is best provided by government screeners or the private sector. Subcommittee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Alabama, said the ""Screening Partnership Program,"" as the privatization effort is formally known, creates jobs by replacing federal screeners with private screeners, without impacting security. Though little noticed by the traveling public, the government already allows 16 airports to employ private screeners, including San Francisco International Airport. The private screeners wear TSA uniforms, work under TSA supervision and follow TSA rules and protocols. But other airports want to join. Some airport executives have argued that contract security personnel are more courteous than government workers. ""It was felt that a private contractor would provide friendlier customer service to the traveling public,"" the head of a Roswell, New Mexico, airport wrote to Congress. For Debbie Alke, a Montana state transportation department official who sought the change at West Yellowstone, it's a simple question of jobs. The six TSA jobs held by nonresidents soon will be held by residents, she said. ""We support our people,"" she said. ""Even if we could get one Montana job we would be happy."" The TSA said it soon will request bids to operate the airport's security. The change ""could allow the agency to reassign federal resources to other airports, which would be advantageous to the comprehensive security network,"" a spokesman said. The other two airports -- Bert Mooney and Orlando -- ""failed to demonstrate an operational, security, or cost advantage that provides a clear and substantial benefit over federalized screening operations,"" he said.","Instead of flying in federal employees, airport will be able to hire locally .
Plan may save the federal government money .
TSA decision to allow private security workforce is a rare concession these days ."

"(CNN) -- The State of the World's Mothers is ... strong. In Finland, that is. Or anywhere in Scandinavia. And most of Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. They all place in the top 20 of Save the Children's annual Mothers' Index. But motherhood in sub-Saharan Africa is a very tough proposition. The region has all 10 of the most difficult places for mothers in this year's ranking, with conflict-plagued Democratic Republic of the Congo last on the list. Among the bottom 20, only Haiti, Papua New Guinea and Yemen are in other regions of the world. And the United States? We come in 30th on the Mothers' Index. We may be 10th in per capita income and the number of years a mom can expect her child to attend school. But the good news ends there. We are just above Japan and South Korea overall, but below Belarus, Canada, Israel and Poland. This year's report on the State of the World's Mothers shows that we need to do better by moms in many parts of the world, including right here at home. Two factors holding the United States back are indicators we've found to best represent the health and well-being of mothers and children -- their chances for survival. When it comes to a woman's lifetime risk of dying in pregnancy or childbirth, we do better than only five other developed countries: Albania, Latvia, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine. American women are 10 times more likely to die eventually from pregnancy-related causes than women in Estonia, Greece or Singapore. Opinion: Men, step up on family planning . Our child mortality rate, meanwhile, is on par with those in Qatar and Slovakia. Moms here are also three times as likely to lose a child by age 5 as moms in Iceland. After 14 years of assessing the state of the world's mothers, Save the Children finds child mortality an indicator not only of children's health and nutrition, but of the quality of care that mothers receive before, during and after pregnancy. This year's report delved deeper into the dangers posed to children on what turns out to be the riskiest day of life -- the first. In the United States, 11,300 babies a year die on the day they are born. That's more than in the rest of the industrialized world combined. What can be done to save babies here is not as clear as in many parts of the world. Globally, more than 1 million babies die the day they are born. But we also know that up to 75 percent of the 3 million newborns who die in the first month of life could be saved if trained health workers -- not necessarily doctors -- could deliver very basic interventions. An antiseptic costing 25 cents could prevent deadly infections starting in the umbilical cord. Basic resuscitation devices costing $6 and less could save 229,000 babies a year. ""Kangaroo Mother Care"" could save nearly a half-million premature babies through the warmth of their own mothers' skin, no incubators necessary. Opinion: On Mother's Day, let's talk diapers . But in the United States, every baby can easily have access to far more sophisticated care at birth. So why are babies still dying and what can we do for them and their moms? Some of the reasons are congenital and difficult to address anywhere. Another reason is our high rates of premature birth. One in eight babies is born too soon here. We can't fully explain this, although we know that the age of the mother and health issues like obesity play a role, as do high rates of elective cesarean sections. What we do know is that poor women are more likely to lose their babies, and that African-Americans suffer the highest rates of loss. We need more research in this area and more action for America's poorest children in general. Save the Children is calling on Congress to create a National Commission on Children to address the critical issues facing the 22 percent of American children born into poverty. Those issues include boosting their chances of surviving the very first day. American mothers deserve this action. There's one other important indicator on our Mother's Index: political status. Countries that outperform their economic peers on maternal and child health tend to do very well on the political status of women. If we look back to 2000, the year of our first Mothers' Index, Rwanda had a very high rate of female representation in government. Since then it has made some of the greatest regional gains in helping its mothers and children survive. The Scandinavian countries also have long had high proportions of women in parliament, and they have some of the world's most supportive policies around motherhood, and some of the best outcomes for mothers and their children. It makes sense that when women are in political power, children in that country do better. They know firsthand what mothers and children need to succeed. Today, women hold 19 percent of seats in the U.S. Congress -- the highest percentage in our nation's history. But still, about half the countries in the world do better than that. The United States remains the only developed country with no guarantee of paid maternity leave and is lagging behind on how much women earn compared with men. We need more women -- and men -- in leadership positions to focus on what will make a difference for American mothers and children to get our country out of 30th place. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carolyn Miles.","Carolyn Miles: State of world's mothers best in places like Scandinavia, Singapore .

"(CNN) -- Lava flowed Tuesday from two Alaskan volcanoes, with authorities placing both on the second-highest alert levels because ""sudden explosions ... are possible with little or no warning."" The volcanoes are Pavlof and Cleveland, both in the Aleutian Island range southwest of mainland Alaska. The Alaska Volcano Observatory has issued a watch due to heightened activity, plus an orange code regarding how they might affect planes in the area. At Pavlof, the higher of the two summits at 8,261 feet, the observatory reported ""eruptive activity"" that followed ""an increase in seismic activity."" Lava has been spotted about 0.3 of a mile (half a kilometer) down the volcano's north flank. Unlike Cleveland, Pavlof is not on an island but rather is connected to the Alaskan mainland. The 5,676-foot high Cleveland is about 350 miles to the southwest. It has 100-meter wide swath of lava extending about 1 mile down its southeastern flank, according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory. Five climbers killed in Philippines after deadly volcanic ash blast . That organization noted Cleveland could produce ash clouds rising more than 20,000 feet above sea level. Beyond any impact on fish, wildlife and humans, large ash clouds could negatively impact air travel. ""They are very similar, and both have the ability to erupt,"" John Power, a scientist from the U.S. Geological Survey, told CNN. After ""eruptive activity"" last year at the Cleveland volcano, University of Alaska Fairbanks scientist Steve McNutt noted that 90% of air freight from Asia to Europe and North America flies over Alaska airspace, and hundreds of flights fly through Anchorage's air space daily. Why some travelers seek out world's most dangerous locales . ""We think of the Aleutian Islands as being remote and desolate"" Power explained, ""but when you come up to 30,000 feet we are talking about 20 to 30,000 people there every single day."" Power described Pavlof as ""one of the most historically active volcanoes in the Northern Hemisphere. Cleveland is also ""very active,"" having last had a large eruption in 2001. A complicating and potentially troubling factor for Cleveland is it's not monitored with ground instruments, like Pavlof. Years of declining budgets have made adding such technology, to such a remote locale, increasingly challenging.. And all of it means it takes longer for anyone to realize Cleveland erupts, which could prove hazardous for any planes flying through. ""For instance, ... on May 4, we had a sizable eruption, and we weren't even aware for about 40 minutes,"" Power said.

"(CNN) -- This might be the start of a new chapter in the browser wars. Over the weekend, Google Chrome routed more Internet traffic than Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which long has held its spot as the most-used Web browser in the world, according to data from StatCounter, an Internet monitor. Don't rush to over-interpret this bit of news, though. Other Internet trackers still show Internet Explorer -- which comes pre-installed on many Windows computers and has long been a default -- in the lead. And some groups have criticized StatCounter's data collection methods, saying the group does not account for the different ways countries collect Internet traffic data. Still, the numbers are a sign of the times. Bonjour Google! Gmail adds auto-translation . Google Chrome, which is regarded as the hipper, faster and more developer-friendly browser, is gaining ground on the competition. ""Whether Chrome can take the lead in the browser wars in the long term remains to be seen, however the trend towards Chrome usage at weekends is undeniable,"" StatCounter's CEO Aodhan Cullen said in a written news release in March, when Chrome bested Explorer for a day. ""At weekends, when people are free to choose what browser to use, many of them are selecting Chrome in preference to Internet Explorer."" According to StatCounter's latest report, which was spotted by the blog Global Nerdy, Google Chrome fielded 32.8% of Web page requests on Sunday. That compares to 31.9% for Internet Explorer and 25.5% for Mozilla Firefox, which once was seen as the most viable alternative to the long-dominant IE. Tech blog TheNextWeb says the numbers aren't exact but they are significant. ""Measuring the Web is an imprecise science, very often based on scaling up small scale measurement surveys,"" the blog writes, ""but the gist of StatCounter's data over the last year indicates that Chrome use is rising ... at the expense of IE and Firefox, regardless of the exact precision of the data."" ComScore, another company that tracks Internet traffic, does not release comparable numbers. But spokesman Andrew Lipsman said in an e-mail that StatCounter's numbers are ""consistent with what I've seen."" ""Chrome has definitely been increasing its share over the past couple years,"" he wrote. Several factors appear to contribute to Chrome's rise. One is frustration with Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which, fairly or not, is seen by some Web users as not very innovative. Another is the increasing role Chrome plays in all aspects of computing, especially for people who use Google's other online services, like Gmail and Google Translate. Some of the browser's features enhance other Google products, and the Chrome Web store is home to an increasingly robust catalog of add-ons that improve the browser's functionality. CNN's partner site Mashable has published a list of some of the best. Google also has tried to position the browser as the basis for the operating system of the future. And then there's the ad campaign. Google has been running TV spots showing people using Chrome to communicate with each other. The tagline: ""The web is what you make of it.""","Report: Google Chrome passes Internet Explorer in browser wars .

"(CNN) -- At the end of April 2010, a couple of weeks before the WHO announced a major 2011 U.N. summit on Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs), I left Merck to start Arogya World, a U.S.-based non-profit with a bold mission -- to change the course of chronic disease. This was the beginning of a very personal journey for me, and the expression of a heartfelt desire to gather like-minded people and make a meaningful contribution to global health. At the core of our work is compelling science. According to the WHO, 80% of heart disease, 80% of diabetes and 40% of cancers can be prevented by increasing physical activity, healthy eating and avoiding tobacco. At Arogya World, we believe deeply in the power of prevention. Globally, we shine a spotlight on NCDs -- heart disease, diabetes, cancers and chronic lung diseases -- and advocate for their prevention. In India we are implementing programs for diabetes prevention through lifestyle changes. There we launched mDiabetes, our flagship program, a groundbreaking one-million-person diabetes prevention mHealth effort conducted with Nokia -- and an ongoing Clinton Global Initiative Commitment. Over the last two years, we have collected a group of committed, passionate individuals -- including advisors like Raj Dave -- and immersed ourselves in the difficult task of moving hearts and minds. Our approach is to leverage strong science, medical and non-medical experts, public-private partnerships and modern technology to make measurable public health impact -- improving lives and livelihoods around the world. Why NCDs? Why India? Two out of three deaths in the world today are caused by NCDs, some 80% of them in developing countries. By year 2030, NCDs are estimated to cause more than five times the number of deaths from HIV, TB, malaria and maternal and child mortality, combined. And the cost is staggering -- projected to be trillions of dollars in lost productivity over the next two decades. NCDs have become a world crisis, changing the face of global health as we know it, demanding urgent political action and international co-operation. Twenty percent of India's people have one chronic disease, and 10% more than one. Diabetes (which runs in my father's family) is at catastrophic levels in India, where more than 50 million people live with the disease, and 1 million die from it each year. And Indians get diabetes on average 10 years earlier than their Western counterparts. Half of India (more than half a billion people) is under 25 years of age. As these young people get into their 30s and 40s and start getting diabetes in large numbers, the public health impact will be huge. Our immediate goals in India are: . 1) Educate at least 1,000,000 Indians in diabetes prevention. 2) Execute and measure the effectiveness of interventions targeting consumers, schools and the workplace. 3) Bring about behavior changes proven to prevent diabetes in 50,000 people. And, we want to use what we learn to establish a scalable model for prevention of chronic diseases. mDiabetes is key to achieving these goals. In September 2011, at the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting, we pledged to reach one million people from all over India over a period of two years, and to measure the effectiveness of our program. We're sending text messages on diabetes and its prevention twice a week in 12 languages, providing six months of content at no charge to the consumer. We were joined by many partners in this big, bold effort - Nokia, Emory University, Aetna, Johnson & Johnson, Biocon and Ipsos -- and we thank them for partnering with an unknown (we prefer the epithet ""small but mighty"") non-profit. With Emory University, we developed diabetes awareness and prevention messages with a strong emphasis on science and proven principles of behavior change. We then reviewed them for cultural relevancy and technical accuracy with our Behavior Change Task Force, a group of medical, health promotion and consumer communications experts. To date, we've reached 100,000 consumers, and are on track to reach one million by next year. See a 1 minute video on Arogya World's work in India . We are measuring results, so that we can correct course as needed and improve program effectiveness. This is no pilot -- we have completed the first phase of research with 750 consumers, and will be conducting more rigorous evaluation of behavior change. What is the promise of mDiabetes? We want to evaluate the effectiveness of mDiabetes in both urban and rural India, and then expand our program to include other NCDs such as heart disease, etc. Ultimately, we wish to establish a scalable chronic disease prevention model. There are many reasons why we are genuinely excited about the promise of mDiabetes: . 1) Mobile phones have a broad reach in the developing world -- some 75% of the mobile subscriptions today are in the developing world. In India alone there are more than 900 million mobile subscribers. 2) And it is the same developing countries that are hardest hit by NCDs -- mHealth could provide helpful and cost effective solutions. 3) Initial results from the Message Refinement phase of mDiabetes research are encouraging: overall, consumers reacted very favorably to the messages and found them clear, compelling and useful. Eighty-five percent said they would be willing to share the messages -- we find that extremely promising. If effective, mDiabetes could be replicated in other countries, and evolve into a global solution to the NCD crisis. Developing countries, already burdened by the scourge of infectious diseases and maternal mortality, are finding it hard to grapple with the growing burden of NCDs, and would likely find such an approach affordable and easy to adopt. The Political Declaration on NCDs adopted unanimously at the UN Summit in September 2011 by all countries, asked for a ""whole of society"" approach to tackle NCDs, one of the greatest health and development challenges of the century. We at Arogya World agree -- NCDs are our collective responsibility to fix. mDiabetes and the rest of our work, including our global advocacy for NCD prevention, are this one NGO's response to that call to action. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Nalini Saligram.","Arogya World's key focus in India is diabetes prevention through lifestyle changes .

According to an airline statement, Thai Airways flight 679, operated with an Airbus A330-300 aircraft, departed Guangzhou, China, at 9:25 p.m. and arrived in Bangkok at 11:20 p.m. After touching down, a landing gear malfunction caused the aircraft to skid off the runway, according to the airline. Sparks were seen in the vicinity of the right-side landing gear, near the engine. The airline says the pilot remained in control of the airplane until it came to a stop and its 14 cabin crew led the evacuation of all 288 passengers. No passengers were reported injured during the actual landing. ""Thirteen passengers received minor injuries during the evacuation,"" the airline said.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Defense Department cannot account for about $2 billion it was given to cover Iraq-related expenses and is not providing Iraq with a complete list of U.S.-funded reconstruction projects, according to two new government audits. The reports come from the office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. The Iraqi government in 2004 gave the Department of Defense access to about $3 billion to pay bills for certain contracts, and the department can only show what happened to about a third of that, the inspector general says in an audit published Friday. Although the Department of Defense (DoD) had ""internal processes and controls"" to track payments, the ""bulk of the records are missing,"" the report says, adding that the department is searching for them. Other documents are missing as well, including monthly reports documenting expenses, the audit says. ""From July 2004 through December 2007, DoD should have provided 42 monthly reports. However, it can locate only the first four reports."" A letter accompanying the report is signed by Stuart Bowen, the inspector general. The audit was overseen by Glenn Furbish, assistant inspector general for audits. In a response letter also contained in the report, Defense Under Secretary Mark Easton acknowledges ""a records management issue."" The audit says it believes records management is to blame, and ""has been an ongoing problem for DoD in Iraq. By all accounts, DoD established good internal processes and controls to account for and report on"" the funds it was given after the Coalition Provisional Authority dissolved. Where the records did exist, they matched other records and contained ""good financial documentation supporting individual payments."" Also, there is ""sufficient evidence"" that required monthly reports were sent to the government of Iraq, even though they can't be found, the audit said. The audit deals with a time when Iraq's government was undergoing a transition. The Coalition Provisional Authority ran the country for 14 months from 2003 to 2004. During that time, the authority awarded numerous contracts. When it dissolved in 2004, the Iraqi government gave the U.S. Defense Department access to the $3 billion to pay bills for contracts the provisional authority had awarded. The Defense Department letter from Easton -- the department's deputy chief financial officer -- thanks the inspector general's office for ""the collaborative effort and professional courtesy"" in a series of audits. Separately, the inspector general's office sent a letter Sunday to the U.S. ambassador to Iraq complaining that the U.S. government is not providing Iraq with a complete list of reconstruction projects. The U.S. criteria for selecting which projects to report to Iraq -- which include only those valued at $250,000 or more -- is a central part of the problem, the letter says. The U.S. Embassy says the system is designed to help Iraq ""focus its limited resources on sustainment of infrastructure and other large capital projects done through U.S. reconstruction efforts,"" the report notes. The inspector general's office argues that the limited list -- which is also ""hampered by unreliable data and other data entry problems"" -- does not allow Iraq to decide where to focus its resources, and notes that the country might consider some smaller projects more important than those that are reported. ""Without more comprehensive knowledge about reconstruction projects the (Iraqi government) will not be in a position to maximize the use of its resources,"" the report says. Billions of dollars in spending are not reported to Iraq under the current system, the report says. In a response letter, Peter Bodde, assistant chief of mission for the U.S. Embassy in Iraq, says that while the current system is incomplete, ""it does capture the vast majority of reconstruction projects and there is no other alternative that captures more."" He also notes that the Iraq reconstruction effort ""is now in its very last stages, and all remaining capital projects will be reported through the asset transfer process."" The Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction was created in 2004 to continue oversight of Iraq reconstruction programs.","NEW: The U.S. is keeping Iraq out of the loop on some projects, report says .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea started withdrawing its last remaining citizens Saturday from the manufacturing zone jointly operated with North Korea following weeks of tensions between the two. Pyongyang this week shunned an offer by Seoul to hold talks over the Kaesong Industrial Complex after it halted activity there this month. The complex in North Korea was one of the few symbols of inter-Korean cooperation. South Korea's Unification Ministry announced that 126 workers and 63 trucks departed Kaesong, which lies just north of the Demilitarized Zone, the heavily fortified border that separates North and South Korea. In the past two months, tensions on the Korean Peninsula have been rich in saber-rattling and short on concrete actions. But the Kaesong complex, which houses the operations of more than 120 South Korean companies, appears to have become a significant victim. Growing suffering . Ryoo said the decision to withdraw the South Koreans was a result of their ""growing suffering caused by the unjust actions of the North,"" which has been preventing workers, as well as food and medical supplies, from crossing the border into the zone for the past several weeks. In an apparent last ditch attempt to resolve the crisis Thursday, South Korea proposed formal talks with the North, warning of serious consequences if the offer was rejected. 'Deceptive' offer rejected . But the North spurned the proposal. In a statement on state media Friday, a spokesman for the North Korean National Defense Commission described Seoul's offer of talks about the complex as ""deceptive."" It said that if Seoul ""keeps aggravating the situation,"" it would ""be forced to take the final decisive and crucial measure first."" The South Koreans in the complex are believed to have been looking after the idle factories there. Ryoo said Friday that the South Korean government would support the companies invested in the complex so they can continue with their business activities. Suspending activity . Earlier this month, during a frenzy of fiery rhetoric directed at South Korea and the United States, the North began blocking South Koreans from entering the complex across the heavily fortified border. It then pulled out the more than 50,000 North Koreans who work in the zone's factories, saying it was temporarily suspending activity there. The move surprised some observers since Kaesong was considered to be a key source of hard currency for the regime of Kim Jong Un. The situation on the Korean Peninsula deteriorated after the North carried out its latest underground nuclear test in February, prompting the U.N. Security Council to tighten sanctions on the regime in Pyongyang. The tougher sanctions, together with joint U.S.-South Korean military training exercises in South Korea, intensified North Korea's threats against Washington and Seoul. The North's ominous language, which unnerved the United States enough for it to move missile-defense systems into the region, had appeared to calm somewhat recently. And the U.S.-South Korean military exercises are due to end in the coming days. CNN's K.J. Kwon reported from Seoul, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","South Korea is pulling out its citizens from Kaesong .

"(CNN) -- The constant battle for Internet security saw another brazen attack this week as Russian hackers published millions of passwords they collected after hacking the professional-networking site LinkedIn. Then, hours later, dating site eHarmony announced that a ""small fraction"" of its users -- others were saying 1.5 million -- were compromised by a similar attack. Security professionals suspect the same hackers may have done it. ""That's what we think,"" said Graham Cluley, a senior technology consultant with Sophos Security. ""It was shared in the same places. The content is very similar. And the timing. All of these factors just make it seem like too much to be a coincidence."" It's enough to make some Web users throw up their hands. If the sites we use on a daily basis can't keep our password data secure, how are we supposed to keep ourselves safe? But security experts say there are still plenty of steps we can take (even if too many people aren't following them). How to check if your password was stolen . Password-management firm LastPass has released a secure tool to see if your password was among the more than 6 million stolen from LinkedIn. LastPass created a similar tool for people worried about the security of their eHarmony accounts. Your password still matters . Even in cases such as the LinkedIn breach, when it's a website, not a personal account, that's being hacked, the strength of your password can still help keep you safe. On sites such as LinkedIn, stored passwords are ""hashed,"" meaning the site uses an algorithm to encode them. So, even if hackers get the data, they still have to unravel them before they're useful. ""Don't give up. Don't think this is all futile,"" Cluley said. ""Choose a long, hard-to-crack, unique password. Not dictionary words. Not a sequence of numbers -- use something that basically looks like gobbledygook. Those will be tougher for the bad guys to crack."" In the case of LinkedIn, there are reports that as many as 60% of the encrypted passwords stolen have been decoded, raising questions about the strength of its security system. Be careful of post-hack e-mails . When there's a well-publicized security incident on a well-known website, online crooks are more than happy to pile on. In the wake of the LinkedIn hack, security professionals were already reporting incidents of users receiving ""phishing"" attempts -- e-mails that look like official communications from LinkedIn. Instead, these messages try to get users to reveal personal data that identity thieves could be use. Or they include links that, when clicked on, can install malware on an unsuspecting user's computer. ""We are investigating the exact details but in the meantime please DO NOT CLICK on links in email to change or verify account information, at LinkedIn.com or on any other membership site,"" Cameron Camp of ESET Smart Security wrote on the company's blog.  ""Instead, navigate to the site directly by typing in the address bar in your browser."" Use different passwords for different sites . Cluley notes that the hackers who attacked LinkedIn and eHarmony may not have even been interested in information from those sites. In many cases, they'll be trying to use the passwords they find on other sites and accounts. Many banks require additional information to log in. But accounts such as Amazon, eBay and PayPal, for example, could be compromised if the user has one password across multiple sites. ""If you get hacked in one place, you get hacked everywhere,"" he said. Lots of folks complain about how hard it is to remember multiple passwords. But there are free online tools that will store and use them for you. Cluley mentioned several, including KeePass, 1password and LastPass. Cluley recommends those tools over letting your Web browser store passwords for you, because there have been cases of security flaws in some browsers, which hackers have exploited to access user data.","Hackers breach LinkedIn, eHarmony sites, stealing millions of passwords .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations has launched humanitarian plans worth $1.5 billion to help ease the suffering of millions of Syrians both inside and outside the country. More than 525,000 Syrians have already crossed into neighboring countries, the United Nations announced Wednesday, and it estimated that more than a million will flee in the next six months. The body believes that a quarter of Syria's population needs food, shelter, medical attention, hygiene materials, clothes and other relief after enduring nearly two years of war. Read more: Syrian VP calls for 'historic settlement,' national unity government . The United Nations is also asking for more than $520 million in additional aid, anticipating that the situation will only get worse in 2013. That amount, officials believe, will help contribute to aid for an estimated 4 million people inside Syria who urgently need help. The number of residents suffering has quadrupled from 1 million in March 2012 to 4 million in December, the United Nations reported Wednesday. Many have fled. Between 2,000 and 3,000 refugees are crossing into Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq every day, according to the United Nations. Plans to help Syria have changed much over the past several months, which is ""indicative of the rapid developments on the ground and the dramatically deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country,"" said Radhouane Nouicer, the regional humanitarian coordinator for Syria with the United Nations. ""The magnitude of this humanitarian crisis is indisputable."" Read more: Refugee figures fail to give true picture of Syria crisis . The aid announcement comes on the same day that one of the United Nations' outreach groups told reporters that about 100,000 Palestinians have fled a large refugee camp in the Syrian capital of Damascus due to government airstrikes and fighting there. By daybreak Wednesday, 1,092 refugees from the Yarmouk camp had crossed into Lebanon through the Masnaa border crossing, seeking refuge with relatives in Palestinian camps in Bekaa, Sidon and Beirut. Yamouk camp spokesman Abu Mohammed, who supports the Free Syrian Army's cause of unseating President Bashar al-Assad, told CNN that the Palestinian people at the camp are not fighting in the war. ""The camp was supposed to be a safe haven,"" he said. ""This was created as a safe zone for refugees. No one can find anywhere else to go."" He said non-stop shelling on the Yarmouk camp has forced tens of thousands to flee, but Mohammed estimates 100,000 remain. ""You have 100,000 people trapped under mortar shelling surrounded by a large Syrian Army presence. This could be a true massacre,"" he said. He called on the international community for help. But a Palestinian politician whose group is believed to support Assad said the Free Syrian Army and its affiliates are responsible for injecting the refugees into the conflict. ""The Yarmouk camp was safe business as usual until the last few weeks, when the FSA started shelling the camp from outside,"" said Hussam Arafat, of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command. ""They were clashing and firing mortars on the Syrian army, which was based on the outskirts of the camp ... Then they managed to control the camp after a bloody battle with the Syrian army."" Life is dangerous even for the elite in Syria these days. Interior Minister Mohammed Shaar was admitted to the American University Hospital in Beirut on Wednesday for treatment for injuries sustained when his ministry building was bombed last week, the official Lebanese news agency NNA reported Wednesday. ""Minister Shaar is in a stable condition, sustaining burns and shrapnel and will not need surgery... He needs observation and treatment,"" one of the doctors who treated Shaar told NNA. Other Wednesday developments . At least 161 people were killed across Syria Wednesday, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a Syria-based opposition activist network. Of those deaths, 67 occurred in Damascus and its suburbs, and 50 occurred in Aleppo. At least 40 people were killed and dozens were wounded by a car bomb that exploded in Aleppo's Marjeh neighborhood, the LCC said. The Damascus suburb of Deir Al-Asafir endured fierce shelling from rocket launchers, according to the LCC. The FSA downed a war plane in Hama, the LCC said . In Homs, Assad's forces raided university residences near Shamas village and arrested students, the LCC said.

"London (CNN) -- As I write, we have just received news of what we believe to be the 29th Tibetan in the past month to set fire to themselves in protest at Chinese rule in Tibet. By the time you read this, it is likely that more have made this extraordinary choice. At Free Tibet we have seen protesters die from their injuries and survivors disappear by Chinese state authorities. It's hard to imagine how bad the circumstances must be for a person to decide that the most effective way they can make their views known is to wrap barbed wire around their body -- so that burning clothes cannot be pulled off them -- drink gasoline, pour it over themselves, light the fuel and be consumed by fire. Tibetans can't vote, their petitions to government are ignored, protest of any kind is criminalized and, once imprisoned, most Tibetans are denied a lawyer. Without legal or political recourse to address their grievances, they risk their lives, their liberty and the safety of their families to protest China's occupation of Tibet. This goes some way to explain why more than 90 Tibetans from all walks of life have called for freedom by setting themselves on fire -- all other avenues have proved futile. There are thousands more who have protested in other ways. China has responded not by negotiating, but by perpetrating further violations of Tibetans' human rights in efforts to stamp out dissent, which is deemed a threat to ""One China."" We have seen military and security forces descend in large numbers on places where self-immolations have taken place. Over much of the last year and a half, since a young monk called Phuntsog set fire to himself there, the Chinese military have lined the streets of the town of Ngaba; road blocks restricting people's movements. Free Tibet has received reports of security forces ransacking homes, beating people in their houses and in public in a show of force and intimidation of the community. People suspected of being involved with those who have set fire to themselves are criminalized. Rewards -- the equivalent of a generous annual salary -- are on offer for information about collaborators, and anyone suspected of collaboration can expect to receive a prison sentence of up to 13 years. Free Tibet has documented a number of incidents of collective punishment of communities where protests have taken place. Last month, a public information broadcast on Tibetan television outlined, in great detail, collective punishment measures for communities where self-immolations take place: the families of those who set fire to themselves will have any state benefits removed, communities where protests take place will not receive investment for local projects for three years; government officials will be ""removed."" Although protests by fire have captured the attention of the international media, there are other protests across Tibet that have not gained such coverage. Thousands, from school children to the elderly, are engaging in peaceful protests. They have been shot at -- some killed, many more wounded -- by Chinese security forces. Over five days in January, in three separate incidents, Free Tibet received reports that five Tibetans were shot dead, many more wounded, when security forces opened fire on peaceful protesters. We believe those suspected of involvement in the protests have been rounded up and detained in their hundreds; scores have been disappeared; many have been tortured and some have died while in detention, most likely from the wounds they sustained during torture. Others have acted alone. Jigme Dolma, a 17-year-old girl, was beaten and detained by security forces for throwing Buddhist writings in the air and calling for the release of political prisoners. Her protest lasted five minutes; her sentence, after having been disappeared for several months, is three years in prison. The rest of the world knows very little about the situation in Tibet because few places today, except perhaps North Korea, are so effectively cut off from the rest of the world. Internet and mobile phone signals are routinely blocked, particularly in areas where protests take place. When they aren't blocked they are tightly monitored and Tibetans suspected of ""sharing information"" are regularly disappeared or detained and receive up to life imprisonment just for sending an e-mail. One Tibetan, who declined to be identified, recently told us: ""I really don't have the courage to sacrifice my life with immolation but I can spend time in Chinese jail for passing on the truth."" Human rights monitors and international diplomats are refused entry to Tibet and the international media are banned. The only journalists who have reported from Tibet over the last two years have done so by entering the country undercover, hidden on the back seats of cars. Even then, most only manage to film through a car window. All these impediments make securing and verifying information an extremely dangerous job for anyone inside the country, and a constant challenge for organizations like Free Tibet. Free Tibet ensures that governments do know what is happening in Tibet, despite China's best efforts to gloss over and conceal the truth. Sadly, many countries choose to turn a blind eye. We welcome steps taken by the U.S. -- for instance Ambassador to China Gary Locke's public statement urging Beijing to negotiate with the Tibetan people to address policy failures in Tibet -- but there is so much more that the international community must do if Tibetans are to enjoy the freedoms so many of us take for granted. *Please note CNN has offered the Chinese government a chance to comment but we have not yet received a response. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephanie Brigden.","Free Tibet: We have seen protesters die from their injuries, survivors disappear by authorities .

"Miami (CNN) -- After weeks on the run and days in immigration detention, American technology pioneer John McAfee arrived in Miami on Wednesday. He said he had no choice in the matter, that Guatemalan authorities expelled him to the United States and put him on a plane to a destination they determined. ""I was whisked out of prison,"" McAfee told CNN affiliate broadcaster WSVN in front of his South Beach hotel. ""I was forcibly separated from Samantha, and now here I am."" Samantha Venegas is McAfee's girlfriend. When the plane landed, U.S. officials boarded the aircraft to greet him and escort him off. Former girlfriend: McAfee 'frightened for his life' It was unclear whether he planned to stay in Miami or where he might go next. For the past week, McAfee waged a public battle, requesting an asylum in Guatemala and arguing that police in Belize were persecuting him. Authorities turned down his request and told him he would have to leave the country. ""He opted to return to his country of origin,"" said attorney Telesforo Guerra, who has represented McAfee since he arrived in Guatemala last week. Authorities in Belize, where McAfee had lived since 2008, say they want to talk to McAfee about the November 11 killing of his neighbor, American businessman Gregory Faull. McAfee said he had nothing to do with the death and insists he left Belize to escape police persecution. Guatemalan authorities took him into custody on accusations of entering the country illegally, and his asylum bid was rejected. McAfee told WSVN he has openly criticized Belize's government for seven months, making himself a ""thorn in their side."" ""Unfortunately, now that I'm here, they can't shut me up,"" he said. CNN en EspaÃ±ol's Adriana Hauser reported from Miami. CNN's Joe Sutton and Ana maria Luengo-Romero reported from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Heading into Wednesday, majorities of Americans in virtually every major poll predicted President Barack Obama would come out on top in this year's presidential debates. Even majorities of Republicans and Romney supporters thought the GOP nominee was in for a rough night. But not all of them. At a time when most surrogates were competing in the traditional expectations-setting limbo contest that always precedes presidential debates, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie predicted that Mitt Romney, seasoned veteran of roughly 20 debates within the past year alone, would prevail. ""Wednesday night's the restart of this campaign,"" he told NBC. ""Come Thursday morning, the entire narrative of this race is going to change."" No matter how the narrative looks moving forward, there's no question Romney claimed it in Denver on Wednesday night. 5 things we learned from the presidential debate . He didn't just score wins on the margins, holding his own against the president; he won big. Since the question of which candidate did better in a presidential debate was first asked by Gallup in 1984, no candidate has ever scored more than 60% on the question, until Wednesday night, when 67% of the voters in CNN's post-debate poll gave Romney the edge. It was a relatively placid debate with few direct confrontations, virtually no sustained attacks, and occasionally no attacks at all, on some of Romney's most vulnerable areas. Voters finally tuning in to the race for the first time on Wednesday would leave without hearing most of the themes that have dominated the trail since the race began. Funniest tweets about the debate . A lengthy discussion of entitlement spending, and a follow-up segment devoted to the role of government, rolled by without a single mention of Romney's 47% remarks. A discussion of high finance and companies that ship jobs overseas passed without a mention of Bain Capital, a topic that had dominated the Obama campaign's messaging for months and seemed to have done Romney real damage in key swing states like Ohio. Romney spent weeks before the debate practicing, leaving nothing to chance, from his body language to every one-liner in his arsenal. And it showed: He didn't have to reach for answers or decide how to handle debate stage dynamics. His performance came across like the campaign equivalent of muscle memory. Connecting with the viewer: 'Romney was able to out Obama' Obama's answers were long and winding, featuring more than their fair share of provisos and to-be-sures, even a bit hesitant. Romney's were direct, confident and black-and-white. As his team had hinted before the debate, he claimed the fact-checking mantle as his own, deflecting attention from a string of previously debunked statements by aiming the truth-stretching accusation at Obama, and masterfully working in a passing reference to the president's lifestyle that seemed designed to reduce the advantage his own wealth had given his opponent: ""Mr. President, you're entitled to your own house and your own airplane, but not your own facts."" That particular jab seemed to beg for a pointed response about privilege that never came. Not only did Romney put Obama on the defensive, at times, the president seemed to put himself there, raising and responding to conservative attacks that hadn't yet been mentioned. The imbalance in the performances immediately showed up in polls after the debate ended: Romney, at least for the night, erased deficits and regained ground he'd lost on key questions. By double-digit advantages, the registered voters in CNN's poll said he came across as the better leader and better on the economy. Read a transcript of the debate . On the likeability question -- where the president's held the edge all year, generally by a double-digit advantage -- Romney closed the gap: 46% said he was the more likeable candidate, to 45% who said the same of Obama. Still there were some hints of strategies that might make re-appearances in future debates. With a more aggressive posture, Obama's demands for policy details from Romney could draw blood. One of the biggest advantages Romney has on the president is the fact that Obama has four years of proposals to critique and a track record of both successes and failures. Romney has had no track record, no time in office, since well before the financial crisis began. And by releasing as few details as possible about most of his policy plans, he's been able to make ambitious promises that far outstrip any achievement someone in office would be able to match in a real-world environment. A sustained push by the president could pose questions his plans aren't yet specific enough to answer. At crossroads of economic crisis, debate disappoints . And the president's comeback to Romney's assurance to current Medicare patients that their own care would remain unaffected under his plan highlighted the glaring political weak spot: ""If you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen, 'cause this, this will affect you,"" said Obama. But for the moment, Romney's regained the momentum, re-energizing his base while the president faces the sort of second-guessing his opponent had been battling for the past month. The question is whether the flash polls are recording a flash in the pan, or whether, with roughly a month left in the race, the governor can translate his performance into the sort of healthy, sustained bounce that eluded him after the Republican convention.

"(CNN) -- The gray wolf population in Wyoming has grown enough to be removed from the endangered species list and will stop receiving federal protection next month, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Friday. The decision means that gray wolf has recovered from near extinction throughout the Northern Rocky Mountains, which includes all of Idaho and Montana and parts of Washington, Oregon and Utah, officials said. The wolves in Wyoming won't be protected under the Endangered Species Act effective September 30, when the packs will be managed by the state, federal officials said. ""The return of the wolf to the Northern Rocky Mountains is a major success story, and reflects the remarkable work of states, tribes, and our many partners to bring this iconic species back from the brink of extinction,"" Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe said in a statement. The Northern Rockies are home to at least 1,774 adult wolves and more than 109 breeding pairs, and the population has exceeded recovery goals for 10 consecutive years, officials said. The vast majority of Wyoming's gray wolves live in the northwest section of the state, where the animals will be managed by state wardens as ""trophy game"" year-round, federal officials said. Wyoming officials will regulate the timing, methods and numbers of gray wolves taken through regulated hunting. Wolves found to be preying on livestock also may be controlled, federal officials said. Environmental and wildlife groups took exception to the federal decision, saying the gray wolf hasn't fully recovered. ""Today's decision by the Fish and Wildlife Service allows Wyoming to return to the days of random wolf killing that led to the species' endangerment in the first place,"" said Sylvia Fallon, wildlife conservation director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The environmental group Earthjustice said Congress last year gave hunters and trappers in Montana and Idaho the right to kill wolves that had been once protected, nullifying a court victory by the group that would have prevented the hunts. ""Wyoming's open season on wolves in almost all of the state would allow aerial gunning of wolves and even killing wolf pups in their den,"" Earthjustice attorney Jenny Harbine said. ""Wyoming law also allows unrestricted killing of wolves if they are found to be 'harassing' livestock or domestic animals, even if wolves are intentionally baited into the conflict,"" said Harbine. ""These policies could drive wolves back into local extinction."" Last December, Wyoming counted 328 wolves, including 48 packs and 27 breeding pairs, the Wyoming Game & Fish Department said. That figure included 224 wolves, 36 packs and 19 breeding pairs outside Yellowstone National Park, state officials said. In areas of Wyoming where wolves are designated as predatory, ""no state license is required to take a wolf, and there are no closed seasons or bag limits,"" the state agency said. Hunters are required to report the kill to game wardens within 10 days and aren't required to present the skull or pelt, though state officials are encouraging them to do so for genetic monitoring. Wyoming wildlife chief Brian Nesvik said, ""We are taking a conservative approach to wolf hunting seasons during this time of transition from federal to state management. We need time to assume the important responsibilities of wolf population monitoring, sport harvest management and meeting Wyoming's commitments to wolf conservation in our state."" Wyoming officials must ensure population levels of at least 150 wolves and 15 breeding pairs, and the federal wildlife service will monitor the species in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho for at least five years to ensure the animal's recovery, officials said. The federal agency can put the gray wolf back on the endangered list if necessary, U.S. officials said. ""Our primary goal, and that of the states, is to ensure that gray wolf populations in the Northern Rocky Mountains remain healthy, giving future generations of Americans the chance to hear its howl echo across the area,"" Ashe said. ""No one, least of all Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, wants to see wolves back on the endangered species list. But that's what will happen if recovery targets are not sustained."" The gray wolf grows to 2.5 feet in height and up to 6 feet in length, weighing between 80 and 100 pounds. Its coat varies from black to white, and the animal is noted for its broad snout, round ears, and long, low howl.","Environmentalists decry decision as a ""return to the days of random wolf killing""

"(CNN) -- A top Florida lawmaker is demanding that the federal government help ""get to the bottom"" of dozens of deaths at a now defunct boys' reform school. ""For the sake of those who died and the family members still living, we've got to find out what happened at the school,"" U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, said in a letter dated Wednesday to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. His demand follows a report this week by state forensic investigators who say they've discovered evidence that there are 19 more grave sites than previously thought at the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys in the Florida panhandle town of Marianna. For years, stories and allegations of beatings, torture and murder have surrounded the century-old school. State authorities have previously said there were 31 burial sites at the school, and a 2009 state investigation found no allegations of wrongdoing in connection with those deaths. Now, investigators say there's evidence that 98 boys died at the school, and some of them may be buried in the 50 graves found on school grounds. The school closed last year, allegedly because of budget cuts. Mystery surrounds school graves . ""The reform school may yield some ugly reminders about our past, but we absolutely must get to the bottom of this,"" Nelson said in a news release Wednesday. Nelson is asking the Justice Department to provide support and assistance to a team of anthropologists and forensic scientists from the University of South Florida as they continue to search the school grounds. The Justice Department has not yet responded to Nelson's request. The USF team, equipped with ground-penetrating radar, is currently searching another part of the property where another cemetery may exist. So far, they haven't found anything. ""We found burials within the current marked cemetery, and then we found burials that extend beyond that,"" said Dr. Erin Kimmerle, one of the investigating anthropologists. ""For the majority, there's no record of what happened to them. So, they may be buried here, they may have been shipped to their families. But we don't know."" She said she hopes a more thorough investigation, which would include the exhumation of bodies, would bring some closure to the families. ""When there's no knowledge and no information, then people will speculate and rumors will persist or questions remain,"" she said. Glen Varnadoe's uncle, Thomas Varnadoe, died at the facility in 1935. He wants state authorities to carry out exhumations so he can bring his uncle's remains home to Lakeland, Florida. ""This is my uncle's body. We want the state of Florida to point us to his grave and give us access to his remains so we can have him reburied with his family,"" he told CNN. Varnadoe said both his father and uncle were both sent to the facility at one time, and -- according to his mother -- his father saw his dead uncle being buried on the property in the middle of the night. Varnadoe says he does not intend to sue the state of Florida for damages. He says he simply wants his uncle's body. ""My mission is to recover his remains and bury him next to his mother,"" he said. Who exactly is buried on the school grounds is a mystery that dates back to 1900, when the boys' school opened. The research team has gone back in time, going over old, antiquated state records and conducting interviews with survivors, when possible. The existing cemetery is marked only by 31 rusting tubular steel crosses. The forensic investigators say poorly kept, contradictory records have only added to the mystery about the cemetery and the school. Reform school ledgers and notations label some of the boys as ""runaways,"" but it is unclear whether these boys were ever found. The school was officially closed in 2011. ""These are children who came here and died, for one reason or another, and have just been lost in the woods,"" said Kimmerle. ""It's about restoring dignity."" During its century-long history, 98 deaths have been documented at the school, but the whereabouts of 22 bodies cannot be determined by examining historical records, according to Kimmerle. Her team's findings only add to the mystery, controversy and horror that has surrounded the former reform school for years. Elderly men, who were once sent to the reform school as wayward youth, have come forward with horrific tales of beatings, abuse and stories of boys who simply disappeared. In 2008, Florida's then-Gov. Charlie Crist ordered a state investigation into allegations by a group of men, known as ""The White House Boys,"" who had came forward with stories of how they were beaten with leather straps by school administrators in the 1960s. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement issued a report that found 31 boys were buried in the cemetery, although each individual plot could not be identified. That report found that most of the boys had died either in a 1914 fire or from a flu pandemic four years later. At the time, the law enforcement agency said it could not determine where another 50 boys -- who died at the school as a result of illnesses or accidents -- were buried, blaming poorly kept school records. FDLE closed the case due to the lack of evidence that anyone had died as a result of criminal conduct, and no charges were filed. The new findings will undoubtedly lead to speculation that the newly discovered graves are evidence of a generations-long criminal coverup by administrators of the prison. In a statement to CNN, FDLE said it is aware of the new report. ""In the absence of any additional evidence, we do not anticipate further criminal investigative action,"" said Keith Kameg, an FDLE communications coordinator.","Sen. Bill Nelson is calling for a federal probe into more graves found at a defunct reform school .
There were 31 known graves and a 2009 investigation determined no wrongdoing .
This year, researchers found evidence of 98 deaths and 50 graves .

"(CNN) -- A 12-year-old accused with stabbing to death his 8-year-old sister at their Northern California home pleaded not guilty on Wednesday during an appearance in a Calaveras County juvenile court, his attorney told CNN. The boy -- who has not been named because of his age -- is charged with second-degree murder in connection with the killing. ""I say he is innocent,"" the boy's attorney, Mark Reichel, said. ""We are going to come back on July 31 to set a date for a trial on that day and we are getting into the issue of whether a 12-year-old can ever be put on trial for murder."" Leila Fowler and her brother were said to be alone on Saturday, April 27, in their family's Valley Springs home when she was found dead. The 12-year-old told police that he'd seen an intruder leaving the home, then found his sister suffering from stab wounds. Sources: Suspect in sister's death had knife at school . The 8-year-old died minutes after arriving at a hospital, authorities said. After the incident, police offered a sketchy description of the suspect as a 6-foot-tall white or Hispanic male with a muscular build. They also interviewed registered sex offenders in the area, ran down leads and searched in attics, storage sheds and more in the rural, mountainous community located about 60 miles southeast of Sacramento. Authorities also combed the Fowler's home and neighborhood looking for evidence. Then on May 11, authorities arrested the boy. The boy's family, according to the attorney, is supporting him. He is ""doing OK under tough circumstances,"" Reichel said. Two adopted Utah brothers, 4 and 10, found dead; oldest brother arrested . CNN's Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- Mali's president has named Diango Cissoko as the country's new interim prime minister, according to state media reports, hours after the abrupt resignation of the former prime minister following his arrest by soldiers. Cissoko is a former public ombudsman for the republic, according to the state-owned newspaper L'Essor. In a brief online report, the newspaper states that interim President Dioncounda Traore signed two decrees Tuesday, one removing Diarra from office and the second naming Cissoko as his successor. Read more: Opinion: Timbuktu tomb attack is an attack on our humanity . ""Things happened very quickly yesterday,"" the report says. Cissoko, 62, is a longtime civil servant, according to public broadcaster ORTM, having served as secretary-general for former President Moussa Traore and his successor, Amadou Toumani Toure, who was deposed in March. Diarra abruptly resigned Tuesday on state television, a day after he was arrested by soldiers loyal to a former coup leader. The development was seen as another blow to the stability of a country once hailed as a model of democracy in Africa, but derailed this year by a coup and an uprising of Islamist militants. It is not yet clear what impact the change in leadership will have on regional and international efforts to tackle advances by the militants in the country's North. Read more: U.N. defers decision on military intervention in Mali . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Tuesday he was ""troubled"" by the resignation and called again for a cessation of military interference in politics. He called for Mali to hold elections and restore peace and stability. The Economic Community of West African States, which appointed the interim president, also expressed concern over the resignation and condemned ""any form of interference by the military in the political process."" It urged the Malian president to ""take all necessary and immediate measures to form a representative and inclusive government as soon as possible in order to pursue the ongoing efforts to end the crisis."" Diarra, a former NASA engineer who holds U.S. citizenship, was set to fly to Paris for medical care Monday. But he received notice that his bags had been removed from the plane he was on, according to an aide who spoke to CNN on the condition of not being named. Diarra went home. Three pickup trucks filled with armed soldiers pulled up late at night and took him away to military headquarters in Kati, five miles north of the capital, Bamako, the aide told CNN. Former coup leader Capt. Amadou Sanogo met Diarra. Before dawn, armed soldiers brought the former prime minister to broadcaster ORTM and gave him a statement to read, said TV technician Adama Haidara. ""I cannot say if he was forced,"" Haidara said. ""He looked unharmed."" In his televised appearance on the military-controlled broadcaster, Diarra did not offer a reason for his resignation, except for a vague statement that he solemnly delivered.

""That's why I, Cheikh Modibo Diarra, have resigned with all my government, on this day, Tuesday, 11 of December of 2012."" Diarra's whereabouts are unknown, but his aide said Tuesday he believed he was still in Bamako. He was not harmed when he was arrested, the aide said. ""The arrest was made by a small force loyal to Sanogo,"" army spokesperson Col. Idrissa Traore said. ""The majority of the military officers in Bamako were not informed about the arrest of Mr. Diarra, and no one knows what will happen now.""

That was until March, when a group of soldiers toppled the government, which it accused of not providing adequate equipment to battle ethnic Tuareg rebels roaming the vast desert in the North. The then-President Amadou Toumani Toure disappeared from sight. The Tuareg rebels took advantage of the power vacuum and seized parts of the North. They have always wanted independence, and have staged several rebellions since the 1960s. After Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was killed in October 2011 and Libya plunged into chaos, Tuaregs, who had fought by his side, took weapons to Mali to ramp up their efforts.

A power struggle erupted between the Tuaregs and local al Qaeda-linked radicals, who prevailed and seized control of two-thirds of northern Mali, an area the size of France. The international community is also worried that al Qaeda's North African wing is expanding into Mali. U.S. officials have said that the wing, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, is linked to the deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three others. Tuareg rebels have retreated from the well-armed militants, but have vowed to fight back and establish their own country in the North, which they call Azawad.

"(CNN) -- A video of a frail and unamused looking Nelson Mandela surrounded by South African President Jacob Zuma and other officials has prompted cries of political exploitation by the government. In the footage released by the South African Broadcasting Corp., the 94-year-old Mandela sits in a chair at his Johannesburg home, barely moving and never smiling as leaders from the governing African National Congress arrange themselves for a photo opportunity. At one point Mandela's grandson takes a picture with flash, causing him to close his eyes and purse his lips. The former president is sensitive to flash photography from his years laboring in quarries during his imprisonment under the country's apartheid government. Zuma says Mandela is in ""good shape,"" but the footage seems to show him looking anything but -- and the stunt provoked outrage from many in South Africa who accused the ANC and SABC of parading the country's anti-apartheid hero on television for their own benefit. ""Very sad seeing the footage of Madiba. And who was the idiot who took a pic of him with a flash? Disgraceful. Leave him alone"", tweeted Johannesburg radio DJ John Robbie, using the clan name by which Mandela is widely referred to in South Africa. Another Twitter user, Brent Lindeque, wrote: ""After everything Madiba has done for us this is how they treat him. Like an animal at the zoo. Shame on the ANC!"" ""[A]fter months of attacking media for 'invading' Mandela's privacy, ANC today released an invasive video of a clearly ailing and grim Mandela,"" tweeted journalist Geoffrey York. One Johannesburg radio station wrote: ""The way #Madiba was paraded on SABC TV this evening was horrible! Grotesque 'journalism'. All involved should hang their heads in shame!"" Mandela endured 27 years in prison before becoming the country's first black president in 1994. He has become increasingly frail over the years and has been hospitalized three times in the past five months, most recently for a lung infection in March. The ANC may have been critical of the media in the past for not respecting Mandela's privacy since his withdrawal from public life, but the party rejected any criticism of Monday's house call. ""The African National Congress has noted the determined efforts by some sections of our society to degrade the visit of the National Office Bearers to Comrade Nelson Mandela,"" party spokesman Jackson Mthembu said in a statement. Mthembu said the visit ""was in line with the accepted norms of Ubuntu that we value our elderly,"" and the party ""stands by its statements that President Mandela is in good health and in good spirits."" ""South Africans are called upon to appreciate that Tata is 94 years old; he will thus be frail and not as active and energetic as we all fondly remember him. There is no reason to be alarmed by the visuals of an elderly person who clearly is receiving the necessary care and attention."" Geoffrey York countered on Twitter: ""ANC misses point. Criticism was because of its political exploitation of Mandela; not because of 'fear' of the images."" Another user, Siya_Ntshoko, wrote: ""[T]he #ANC has no compunction about using a 94 year old frail man to canvass for votes - anything for nostalgia."" The video released Monday was the first of the former leader since his birthday last July. Mandela, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, has a history of lung problems dating back to when he was a political prisoner on Robben Island during apartheid. He contracted tuberculosis during his imprisonment. He underwent treatment for a lung infection and had surgery to remove gallstones over the Christmas holiday in 2012, one of his longest hospital stays since his release from prison in 1990.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- In the final two hours of a dramatic standoff with rogue ex-Los Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner, San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies did not fire a single gunshot during their raid of a compound where he barricaded himself after killing one deputy and seriously wounding another, according to dispatch logs. When the SWAT team arrived on February 12, a robot-controlled tractor tore down blood-spattered walls of the vacated home near Big Bear, offering tactical teams a clean view inside the cabin, logs show. The redacted transcripts detail the chase that began after a 911 call from a Big Bear couple whom Dorner had held hostage at gunpoint and hogtied before fleeing their condo that Tuesday afternoon. The manhunt ended in Dorner's death from a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound. The printed text of dispatch logs began at 12:23 p.m. PT with a frantic cell-phone call to authorities from Karen Reynolds and her husband, Jim, who reported being ""tied up by Chris Dorner,"" who had fled in their vehicle 15 to 30 minutes earlier. According to the logs, about one hour later, the first exchange of gunfire with Dorner occurred when he was spotted by California Fish and Wildlife officers as he attempted to flee the mountain in another stolen vehicle. Women wounded in manhunt to get $4.2 million . When officers identified Dorner's abandoned vehicle and traced him to a vacation cabin, a barrage of gunfire erupted, and hundreds of rounds were exchanged, authorities said. As the gun battle intensified, officers requested an armored vehicle and air support to protect and rescue two officers wounded in the shootout, logs showed. The wounded officers, sheriff's Detective Jeremiah MacKay and Deputy Alex Collins, were loaded into the flatbed of a pickup truck and later airlifted to area hospitals, where MacKay was pronounced dead. Collins was seriously wounded. At 4:05 p.m. PT, police reported green smoke inside the cabin, allegedly set off by Dorner. Five minutes later, a sheriff's tactical unit fired gas canisters into the cabin after Dorner refused to respond to commands to surrender, logs showed. At 4:20 p.m. PT, police dispatch logs reported the sound of a single gunshot from inside the residence. Authorities later said that shot sounded different from the many others than had come from inside the house. Couple recounts being under protection during Dorner killing spree . Moments later, the entire cabin was engulfed in flames, setting off hundreds of rounds of live ammunition purportedly left behind by Dorner. It would take several hours for authorities to safely enter the compound, where they found Dorner's body in the basement. A preliminary examination concluded that his death was the result of a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound. In the days after the incident, authorities defended their tactical strategy of firing gas ""burners"" into the cabin, stating that SWAT team officers had issued several unanswered commands for Dorner to surrender. The dispatch logs were released in response to a request from media organizations, including CNN. During the unprecedented manhunt that went as far as Tijuana, Mexico, the search for Dorner turned to Big Bear after his burning truck was found deserted on a local forest road. In his manifesto posted on Facebook, Dorner allegedly threatened ""unconventional and asymmetrical warfare"" against police. The manifesto was discovered three days after the slaying of an Irvine couple, Monica Quan and her fiancÃ©, Keith Lawrence. Quan was the daughter of a retired Los Angeles police captain whom Dorner allegedly blamed in part for his firing in 2009. While attempting to elude authorities, Dorner killed Riverside police Officer Michael Crain during an ambush and wounded three others. At the height of the search for Dorner, more than 200 officers scoured Big Bear Mountain, cabin by cabin.","San Bernardino County deputies didn't fire guns in last 2 hours of Dorner manhunt .

"Sydney (CNN) -- Of the many challenges China faces in its progression towards global economic leadership over the next 15 years, one of the biggest is the food, water and air security of its 1.35 billion people. It needs to confront this issue with the same zeal and determination it has shown in pursuing economic growth since the 1980s because the environmental downside of that success is the widespread contamination of its soil, water and air -- with costly consequences for the health and safety of its people. China has less than 10% of the world's cultivated land and only 7% of its potable water, but must seek to feed almost 20% of the world's population, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Beijing and other parts of northeastern China are already water-stressed, the air quality in inland mega-cities such as Chongqing and Chengdu is abysmal, farming land is being poisoned by toxic runoff from mining and industrial activities, acid rain blights large parts of south China, contagious disease is an ever-present risk among its livestock, and unscrupulous makers sell tainted foodstuffs. When natural disasters such as drought, floods, earthquakes and landslides are factored in, the food security picture for China can start to look very bleak indeed. At the same time, new demographic and social pressures are emerging: China's people are living longer and eating more, according to the U.N. Population growth and economic prosperity are driving demand for water-intensive and protein-rich food such as meat and dairy. That in turn means farmers must produce more soybeans and corn for animal feed, or import what they can't grow. The speed of the middle class consumption boom is so swift that unless China takes decisive steps soon to re-engineer its food and water usage patterns and supply chains, and commits to a massive greening of its industrial landscape, it risks social dislocation that could undo much of its progress. Food price inflation in the big cities -- China has 160 cities with populations above 1 million -- could trigger unrest. China's current five-year plan puts considerable emphasis on resource conservation and environmental improvements, but time is not on the side of the new leaders about to take office. Still, China has faced existential challenges before. Fifty years ago, it emerged from the most catastrophic famine in its history, when drought, floods and Mao Zedong's disastrous Great Leap Forward experiment in agrarian collectivization claimed the lives of an estimated 30 million to 45 million people between 1958-62. Multiple factors allowed China to recover from those terrible years, including replacing ideology with pragmatism and giving farmers a chance to produce extra crops for themselves. Since then, better farming practices, improved seeds, more mechanization and information, and smoother supply chains have all helped China in its quest for food security. So too have offshore food investments in Asia, Africa, the Americas and Australia -- though managing local reaction to these investments carries its own challenges. Today China is both the biggest producer and consumer of wheat, rice, meat, fish, vegetables and fruit. But it falls short in animal feed. Although China produces 15 million tons of soybeans a year, demand is so high that it must import four times that amount from the United States and Brazil. By 2015 it could be importing 80 million tons a year, while corn imports could reach 20 million tons, according to Morgan Stanley research and forecasts by food companies such as COFCO and Olam. On the food safety front, Chinese consumers scarred by the melamine poisoned milk and tainted meat scandals of the past few years are demanding better quality controls. They are alert, too, to any disease outbreaks in China's vast stock of pigs and chickens. And bubbling in the background is China's problem of water contamination and over-use. According to U.N. FAO statistics, only India uses more water. By the time China's population reaches 1.6 billion around 2030, average water availability will have dropped from 2,195 cubic meters per person a year to just 1,760 m3, the U.N. says. The FAO defines stress conditions as below 1,700 m3, with chronic scarcity below 1,000 m3 and absolute scarcity below 500 m3. Already Beijing, Jiangsu, Shandong and Tianjin are at ""extreme risk,"" according to the 2012 Water Stress Index compiled by global risk analyst Maplecroft. Clearly, China has a lot of issues to handle. But with the right policies, it has the chance both to enhance its food security and rejuvenate its environment. Japan in the 1990s showed how an industrial, heavily-polluted landscape could be re-greened, and how big cities such as Tokyo and Osaka could clean up their air and waterways. Reduce, reuse, recycle has to be China's resources mantra. Farmers must further refine growing cycles to be more water-efficient. Supply chains between farms and urban tables must run faster and keep wastage to a minimum. There is one more ""R"" in the mix - reform. Xi Jinping must lead the reform effort, to address corruption and criminal behavior in the food supply chain. As well, there are three ""Is"" -- innovation, infrastructure and investment -- for the leadership to focus on. There needs to be greater innovation to improve food safety, more investment on infrastructure to upgrade food and water distribution and waste disposal systems, and a proactive approach to long-range investment in domestic and overseas food assets. Failure to preserve China's environment will be costly in multiple ways. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Geoff Hiscock.","China has less than 10% of the world's cultivated land and only 7% of its potable water .

"Shanghai (CNN) -- It's called ""Shanghai's 3rd Annual Love and Marriage Expo."" But the atmosphere at this massive gathering for single Chinese men and women was decidedly unromantic. More than 18,000 people preregistered for the weekend event, located rather incongruously in a sprawling shopping complex specializing in home and office furniture. The crowds were met by billboards posting lists of thousands of single men and women -- one list in pink and the other in blue. Within minutes of the doors opening on a rainy Saturday morning, visitors huddled to study the lists and take in vital intel about potential suitors -- age, height, education, annual income and their registered hometown, also known as hukou. Some people took notes, while others snapped photos of single entries with their cellphones. In one hall more than a hundred men and women in their twenties and thirties sat facing each other at tables decorated with red and yellow tablecloths, the soothing tones of a Norah Jones love song spilling out from loudspeakers. ""Welcome everybody to our 8-minute speed-dating event,"" announced the master of ceremonies eventually. When the eight minutes was up, each dater was instructed to move on. ""Male guests please move two seats to your left,"" boomed the announcer. For some participants, this was the first time they had ever been on a date. ""It's useful...it's just like research,"" said Yixin Bai, a 20-year-old man home for the summer holidays from a university in Canada. Bai said he has never had a girlfriend before. This is not uncommon amongst young Chinese, considering many teens are discouraged from having any romantic relationships in high school and told to focus on school work instead. He came to the expo to learn what women want from men. ""After asking them, I now know something: Women don't like men to rely on their parents,"" he said. Bai was participating in a speed-dating event organized by Zhenai Inc., one of China's largest Internet match-making websites. The company says it has more than 58 million registered users and is growing by one million users a month. Zhenai's founder and CEO is a Columbia University-educated former investment banker named Song Li. He says the one-child policy implemented by the Chinese government in 1979 has resulted in young adults having poor social skills -- crucial in the dating game. ""A lot of kids who were born after 1980, they don't have siblings. So they grow up in an environment where you don't have the experience to meet with people of the opposite sex,"" Li opined. Many participants said they came to the convention because they needed help. They said they found it difficult to meet potential romantic partners outside their immediate circle of friends and family. And many Chinese approaching their late twenties, especially women, are under immense pressure to get married. ""My mother asks, 'Why are you still single? Are you a freak?'"" said Elsie, a 26-year-old woman who was taking part in a speed-dating session. The woman next to her, who asked to be called May and is also 26, said her father asked the same question. ""Everyone has the same story,"" said May laughing. ""I feel free because I'm single... but I know this is the time I need to date somebody. I need to get married before thirty."" Both women said they did not want to become shengnu, or the ""leftover women."" ""It is one of the most talked about issues in Chinese society because a lot of educated women are left behind because they set a very high standard for their future husbands ... and they are less willing, unlike their parents' generation, to compromise,"" said Zhenai's Li. May, who has a good job in human resources at an international firm and speaks fluent English, said this was her first time at a match-making event. She said she had never had a boyfriend before or been in love. ""I have no time to get to know other males at a similar age ... that's why I can't find my Mister Right,"" she said. ""I just wish that I have some luck today."" Despite being rejected by two men, May was in good spirits. She said that the two men needed a women who had a registered hukou in Shanghai. For a gathering of thousands of single men and women, it was surprising to note that there was very little flirting going on. People wandered the corridors picking up brochures from match-making companies and stopped in to listen to self-help lectures from ""life coaches,"" who were schooling women in how to ""brand"" themselves. At times, the Love and Marriage Expo felt like a job fair. Online match-making entrepreneur Li said that was an accurate comparison. Finding a spouse is ""almost like finding a job,"" he said. ""People tend to be very pragmatic,"" he explained. ""[Being single] is a problem that you have an obligation to fix. And your parents feel that it is their obligation to see to it -- to get this problem fixed."" Another startling revelation was that there were nearly as many parents at the Love and Marriage Expo as there were single men and women. Some parents stood at the bustling entrance to the convention holding up printed posters advertising the details of their single children. Others walked alongside their adult sons and daughters, inspecting the booths of different match-making agencies. One match-maker told CNN she had to prohibit parents accompanying their children to the speed-dating tables. ""I respect my parents' opinion,"" said May. ""If my parents say this guy is no good, then I won't date [him]. But if my parents say this one is good, that they are happy with this boy, then I will try."" In some cases, mothers and fathers clearly played a role as social icebreakers for their children. At one point, while wandering the corridors of the convention, May got a phone call. It was her father who was also there. May found him standing next to another father he had just met. The man happened to have a single son who worked in a bank and did not attend the convention. Fortunately he carried a photo -- and a passport -- of his son, which he showed to May. ""His picture looks good. A little bit handsome,"" May responded. Then she stood somewhat awkwardly as the man's father took a photo of her in the crowded corridor. May's father looked over his counterpart's shoulder, murmuring advice as the digital image was taken. May seemed pleased and grateful to the two dads. ""They are both trying to help their child find their Mr. Right and Miss Right.""","Thousands of single men and women gather for 'Love and Marriage' expo in Shanghai .

Penney store burglaries nationwide during questioning. Investigators are still trying to identify accomplices in what they believe was a group. ""We believe that he is the mastermind,"" Strain said of the suspect. ""We believe that he is the one who called the shots, we believe that he is the one that made the decisions on which stores and when they do it."" The rash of thefts began in June, with a break-in at a J.C. Penney store in Indiana. Two of the chain department stores were hit in Texas in July, and in August, two more were burglarized in Louisiana. Louisiana police, acting on information obtained during the investigation, made the arrest in Pasadena, Texas, on Tuesday in conjunction with local authorities. Castillo was booked on two outstanding theft warrants in Texas and as a fugitive from St. Tammany Parish, police said. Strain said the suspect has 27 known aliases and used as many as 16 Social Security numbers. Authorities said they found stolen property inside the suspect's home and in two other storage locations. Strain estimated the value of the recovered property at about $3.5 million. Police released photographs showing a full garbage bag and a table crammed with recovered watches and jewelry. Detectives are working with J.C. Penney officials to coordinate the return of the recovered property, police said. CNN's Sean Callebs contributed to this report.","Authorities recovered about $3.5 million in stolen property; 5 stores hit .

"(CNN) -- As I type this week's column, I look out of my office window and stare at a depressing sight. A heavy blanket of smog and dust hangs over the sky. Buildings nearby are barely visible. Air is barely breathable. I checked the website of the China National Environmental Monitoring Center. It rated Beijing's air quality for the day as ""slightly polluted"". On Twitter, however, the U.S. Embassy's BeijingAir, an air-quality monitoring app, rated the air pollution level as ""hazardous."" What gives? I visited the Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center (BMEMC) to find out. ""We've been using equipment imported from the U.S. to monitor air quality ever since we set up in 1987,"" Vice Director Hua Lei tells me. ""We use the same techniques as the American system."" But there is one difference: the Chinese monitoring stations measure particulates 10 micrometers or smaller, a standard known as PM10. BeijingAir, which reports the reading of an air monitory device installed on the roof of the U.S. embassy building, uses the PM2.5, which measures tiny airborne particulates that cause smog and are deemed more harmful. It ranks air quality from 1 (cleanest) to 500 (dirtiest). ""It measures the very fine particulates which are health concerns, things less than 2.5 micrometers,"" U.S. ambassador Gary Locke tells CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. ""Acceptable range in the U.S. is 35. Here we are near 400, more than 10 times the acceptable level."" That was a few days earlier, when Kristie interviewed the American envoy. Thursday's reading on BeijingAir: 321. I have lived in Beijing for nearly 40 years and have seen the air's quality go from bad to worse. I never imagined it to be this bad. Experts blame the thick haze on rapid urbanization and industrialization. ""What come with them are cars, industries and pollution sources from all kinds of directions,"" says Wu Changhua, China director of The Climate Group, a London-based international organization. Beijing, for instance, burned some 27 million tons of coal in 2010, according to state-run media. Despite efforts to limit the number cars with an auto-plate lottery, it's estimated that Beijing now has over 5 million cars, up from about 3.5 million in 2008. Pollution is more acute because of the sheer size of the city's population (17 million) and the rapid speed of its economic growth, experts say. Some say the costs are mounting. ""They are paying a price first of all individually by premature deaths,"" says Achim Steiner, executive director of the UN Environment Program (UNEP), who is in Beijing to launch the agency's ""green economy"" report. ""China as a society also pays a heavy price in terms of healthcare and lost productivity."" The picture is not all dark. China acknowledges the problems and has pledged to solve them. ""If you look at China's five-year plan (for 2011-2015), there are green-development plans that set high ambitions in energy efficiency, renewable energy as well as pollution reductions and control,"" notes Wu. UNEP's Steiner compliments China as the world's biggest investor in renewable energy for spending $49 billion last year. On the grassroots level, rumblings of a green movement are starting to be heard. Huanbao (environmental protection) is now a catch-phrase among residents and local journalists. Public complaints over Beijing's worsening air quality are common. In recent days, some Chinese microbloggers posted pictures of the national Olympics stadium, also known as the ""Birds Nest"", taken on blue-sky days during the 2008 Olympics, juxtaposed with pictures of the stadium covered with smog. In response, the Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center has opened its facilities to the public once a week. ""We receive scores of residents and local journalists,"" Hua says as she shows me inside a hall equipped with computers and a huge TV screen. ""We show them how we do our monitoring, show how equipments work, and explain our standards and systems. It's good that people are now interested in what we do."" Hua says China may adopt more stringent PM2.5 standards, but gradually. ""It takes time to improve the standards we are using and to gradually adopt international standards,"" she says. ""We'll gradually raise our standards and it is possible that we'll adopt higher standards as the air quality in China gets better."" A number of Chinese netizens are pushing Beijing to change standards immediately. Pan Shiyi, a Chinese real estate tycoon, recently asked his 7.5 million fans on Sina Weibo, a microblogging social network similar to Twitter, to vote on whether Beijing should adopt more stringent standards. Of the 40,000 who voted, 92% agreed that ""the authorities adopt PM2.5 this year."" ""I think that's definitely the direction to go,"" says Wu of The Climate Group. ""China so far has been monitoring PM10 and from the epidemiological perspective, we all know when the particles are bigger they don't go too deep into your lungs and respiratory system. But actually, the more hazardous polluter will be PM2.5."" Wu hopes the Chinese government will soon adopt the higher standards, although she is not sure how quickly it can be done. ""It's being debated at this moment,"" she says . There are encouraging signals this week. Chinese media reports say that at least two cities in south China have decided to adopt PM 2.5 on trial basis. Will Beijing follow suit? Wu hopes for quicker actions. ""I have an 11-year-old child,"" she says. ""I really wish for better air quality, for the nation's authorities to do something not just for us but for future generations. That remains a concern for parents like me and many others.""","China rated Beijing air 'slightly polluted' that U.S. standards rated 'hazardous' this week .

"London (CNN) -- Rights groups have slammed a lunch hosted by Britain's Queen Elizabeth II on Friday for including monarchs criticized for their countries' human rights records. Among those who attended the event at Windsor Castle is the king of Bahrain, whose government has come under fire for its crackdown on anti-government protests last year and its handling of continuing unrest. Swaziland's King Mswati III, accused by critics of enjoying a lavish lifestyle at public expense while his people suffer great poverty, was also there. The monarchs' lunch, with a menu that included English asparagus, lamb from Windsor and strawberries from Kent, is part of celebrations of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, marking her 60 years on the throne. It will be followed by an evening banquet at Buckingham Palace hosted by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall. Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said it was ""outrageous that the queen has invited royal tyrants to celebrate her Diamond Jubilee."" He called for the invitations to monarchs heading nations with poor records on rights to be withdrawn immediately and said protesters would stage a rally outside Buckingham Palace as royals arrive for the dinner. ""The invitations are a shocking misjudgment,"" he said. ""They show the queen is out of touch with the humanitarian values of most British people. She's putting royalty before human rights."" No significant protests marked the monarchs' arrival at Windsor, where they were each greeted by the queen and the duke of Edinburgh before sitting down to eat. But rights group Amnesty International said the event risked giving the impression that Britain did not care about the victims of human rights abuses. ""We can imagine why victims of recent human rights abuses in countries like Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Swaziland and Thailand might feel their plight has been ignored when they see the guest list for the queen's diamond jubilee celebrations,"" said Philip Luther, Middle East and North Africa director for Amnesty International. He said that Bahrain's King Hamad al-Khalifa had tried to address the abuses committed last year by setting up an independent inquiry but that failures to ensure reforms are fully implemented ""make his promises seem hollow."" Luther added: ""He should use this occasion to commit to releasing the prisoners of conscience still held in Bahrain and ensure true accountability for the violations of the last year."" The UK Foreign Office said all the world's sovereigns have been invited to the lunch, which was organized by the Royal Household with its support, although all will not necessarily attend. A Foreign Office spokesman defended the inclusion of al-Khalifa at the lunch, saying Britain and Bahrain ""work together closely on a range of important issues."" ""The UK is a longstanding friend and ally of Bahrain, and ministers regularly meet with Bahraini counterparts in the UK and abroad,"" he said. ""This strong relationship also allows us to have a full and frank discussion on a range ofÂ issues including those where we have concerns. On human rights, we support the reforms already under way in Bahrain, and we want to help promote that reform."" The reforms include ""bringing to account those individuals responsible for human rights abuses,"" he said. Grand Prix organizers were urged to cancel the F1 race in Bahrain last month because of concerns about human rights. Bahrain is home to the U.S. Fifth Fleet and is viewed as an important bulwark against Iran's influence in the Persian Gulf. Bahrain's king is not on the guest list for the smaller evening event, but Swaziland's monarch is among those invited to both lunch and dinner. The menus for the two meals have not been made public. Royals from Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, Monaco, Brunei, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Thailand are among those invited to both events, as are the emperor and empress of Japan. The Spanish queen did not attend, however, amid tensions over a planned visit by Prince Edward and his wife next month to Gibraltar, a UK territory that Spain also claims. ""Queen Sofia has canceled her visit to the UK for the Jubilee celebrations following the advice from the Spanish government that the visit would be inappropriate in the current circumstances regarding Gibraltar,"" a spokesman for the Spanish Royal Household said. CNN's Max Foster, David Wilkinson and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","NEW: The kings of Bahrain and Swaziland are among the royals to attend the Jubilee lunch .

"New York (CNN) -- Three men whose identities surfaced during New York's ""Cannibal Cop"" kidnap conspiracy investigation pleaded not guilty Thursday to their own conspiracy charges, federal prosecutors said. Michael Vanhise, Richard Meltz and Robert Christopher Asch entered not-guilty pleas to conspiracy to kidnap charges and remain in custody, according to Jerika Richardson, spokeswoman for the office of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Vanhise was arrested in January after authorities uncovered e-mail conversations he had with New York police officer Gilberto Valle. In those online conversations, Vanhise agreed to pay Valle $5,000 to render a woman unconscious, stuff her into a suitcase and bring her to Vanhise's home in New Jersey, where she would be raped, according to authorities. Jury convicts New York cop in cannibal plot . Valle, whose attorneys argued in court that his online conversations were the product of ""fantasy role-play,"" was convicted in March of conspiracy to kidnap and accessing a law enforcement database illegally. He will be sentenced in June. According to the complaint against the three men, authorities allege Vanhise engaged in a series of e-mail and instant messages with Asch and Meltz beginning in 2011 during which they discussed and planned in great detail the kidnapping, torture and murder of women. Police arrested Meltz, 65, and Asch, 60, last week on charges of conspiring to kidnap, torture, rape and kill women and children, according to a news release from the U.S. attorney's office. Meltz is the chief of police for a Department of Veterans Affairs medical center in Bedford, Massachusetts. Asch is a former New York City high school librarian who lives in New Jersey. According to prosecutors, an undercover FBI agent met with Asch April 15 to conduct surveillance of a kidnap target, who unbeknownst to Asch was an undercover female agent. During this meeting, Asch brought two bags of tools intended to be used in the kidnapping including a taser gun, rope, meat hammer, duct tape, gloves, cleaning supplies, zip ties, and a dental retractor, a wireless modem, and a leg spreader. Asch's attorney, Bradley Drew Simon, told CNN he did not have any comment. Vanhise's attorney, Alice L. Frontier, meanwhile, said ""the evidence against Vanhise hasn't changed and he obviously maintains his innocence."" Referring to the government's case against her client, Frontier said ""they have little more than his words."" ""Obviously we are going to be filing motions seeking to dismiss the indictment; First Amendment grounds will be one of them,"" Frontier said Thursday. Meltz's attorney, Peter Bril, told CNN, ""No matter what other defendants may have done, Mr. Meltz never took part in anything other than pure fantasy play, this was nothing more than his fantasy life ... He never had any intention in actually engaging in hurting another person."" The next court conference in the case is scheduled for July 11, according to Richardson.","An attorney for one defendant says, ""This was nothing more than his fantasy life""
Another defense attorney says motions will be filed on First Amendment grounds .

"(CNN) -- Allen H. Neuharth, who revolutionized American newspapering by founding USA Today with its colorful layouts and concise storytelling that influenced many media empires, died Friday in his home in Cocoa Beach, Florida, the newspaper said. He was 89. ""The longtime newspaperman, media executive and columnist died after sustaining injuries in a fall at his home,"" USA Today said. Neuharth was a former chairman of Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and 81 other newspapers, who made journalistic history when he took a bold risk launching a daily in 1982 that declared itself the first general interest national newspaper. He battled his own board of directors in championing the publication. Some traditionalists of American journalism criticized USA Today for its emphasis on shorter articles -- calling it ""McPaper"" -- but the paper developed into an extraordinary success financially and journalistically. The newspaper is now the nation's second-largest daily. The iconoclastic Neuharth was fond of saying that ""the editors who called us McPaper stole our McNuggets."" ""Al Neuharth reinvented news,'' USA Today Publisher Larry Kramer said in the newspaper's obituary. ""Even in our recent efforts to translate his vision into the modern world of digital journalism, we relied on him to tell us if we were going in the right direction."" Neuharth ""was, is and always will be USA Today,"" Dave Callaway, the editor-in-chief, added.

"(CNN) -- In a story that could step straight from the pages of a Charles Dickens novel, an Indian son has worked night and day in a garment factory to earn the bail money to get his mother out of jail. This month, after ceaseless work stitching in the textile factory, Kanhaiya Kumari, 19, raised the 5,000 rupees (about $89) needed to pay his mother's surety. His mother Vijaya Kumari, 48, was five months pregnant with Kanhaiya when she was arrested in 1993 in connection with the murder of a neighbor in India's Aligarh district, according to CNN affiliate IBN. Sentenced to life in prison, she denied the charges and in 1994 she was granted bail pending her appeal, but her husband refused to post the Rs5,000 bail money. ""No one from my family or in-laws came to my help,"" she told CNN. Both mother and son remained in Nari Niketan prison in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, until Kanhaiya was sent to a juvenile remand home at the age of 6. ""I was very sad,"" Kanhaiya told CNN. ""Without her, I had no one by me."" He was released last year after spending seven years separated from his mother and immediately set about getting a job that would pay for his mother's bail. ""He was out of work and couldn't make ends meet,"" said his employer AH Rehman. ""He asked for a job that would provide him with some livelihood, so I got him a job in a ready-made garment shop."" Some 19 years after his mother was first jailed, Kanhaiya paid the bail money at Allahbad High Court and secured her release. ""I worked very, very hard to get the money for the release of my mother,"" he said. ""I'm very happy now."" The case has prompted the High Court to take a closer look at the jails of Uttar Pradesh. The court has demanded a list of bailed inmates still languishing in jail. India's courts are famously inefficient, with cases backed sometimes for decades. According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, confessions are the bedrock of India's criminal justice system making it notoriously difficult for courts to secure convictions. The commission estimates the conviction rate for serious crimes is as low as 4 per cent of the cases that come before India's courts.

"Washington (CNN) -- Congress' tangled relationship with the Affordable Care Act entered another phase Monday, raising a new question about whether lawmakers are really experiencing the exchanges the way other Americans do. Monday night was the deadline for members of Congress and the thousands of people who work on their staffs to sign up for the Obamacare exchanges, where they must go to get any job-related health benefits. But with technical problems popping up in the past few days, House administrators gave employees (including elected members) a safety net. If they were blocked by technical problems, staff members will still be able to sign up for another week. Hence the question: Is that a special break for Congress? ""I don't think that's anything special,"" Dan Weiser, spokesman for the chief administrative officer of the House, told CNN on Monday. ""Our employees face a deadline of midnight tonight, and if through no fault of their own they're unable to sign up, then they're being allowed to follow through on their signing up."" Now who's having trouble with health care sign-up? Ask Congress . Throughout the day Monday, a steady stream of staffers stopped by the House payroll and benefits office to check that their sign-up had in fact been verified. The workers asking questions and those answering them seemed at ease. There were no signs of stress or deadline panic as each worker sat down for the few-minute confirmation process. ""This notice confirms your application for employer-sponsored insurance offered by STAFF US House of Representatives was received and approved,"" read the short letters given to verified staff members and shown to CNN by several employees Monday. CNN spoke with some two dozen workers who were checking their health care sign-up. None would allow their names to be used, saying they did not have authorization to speak to the media. But all of them -- Republicans and Democrats -- said they felt the potential deadline extension was appropriate. The question of special treatment for Congress and Obamacare keeps rising like a bad cough, in large part because no other company or individual faces Congress' odd combination of requirements and circumstances. GOP Sen. Graham latest to sign up for Obamacare, refuse subsidy . The exchanges were designed for small companies, with fewer than 50 workers, and individuals who don't have any employer coverage. Congress, on the other hand, employs some 20,000 people. Most companies that size negotiate their own employee plans and enrollment windows with health insurers. But because Congress wanted to taste the medicine of Obamacare firsthand, the Affordable Care Act mandates that the only way members or staff can get health care benefits is by signing up on an exchange. That means they can still buy health insurance off the exchange, but if they do, they will not get the thousands of dollars in premium help that comes as a benefit of their jobs. Because of this, Congress has an enrollment cutoff date, something that makes it different from the start. Outside of Congress, there is no enrollment cutoff date. Of course, the exchanges do have some deadlines: You must sign up by December 23 to get insurance coverage starting January 1, and by March 1, almost every American must have health care or be penalized. But those deadlines are attached to specific events; there is no time that enrollment closes altogether. Obama urges young supporters to talk up Obamacare . The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed that the exchanges allow people to sign up for health care year-round and that Congress is an exception. Thus, only Congress has both a requirement to go on the exchanges to get employee health benefits and a firm enrollment cutoff date. That cuttoff date was set up by the federal Office of Personnel Management and mirrors the sign-up dates for all federal workers. As problems bubbled up for congressional staffers, last week OPM's director gave the Senate and House discretion to help individuals who have tried to sign up but were blocked by technical problems. Is that special treatment? CNN asked experts and members from both parties and could not find anyone who thought so. ""Nobody here felt this was anything special,"" said Weiser. ""This is just the right thing to do."" GOP repeal efforts go silent as Obamacare 'suicide' plays out .","Members of Congress and their staffs got an extension to sign up for Obamacare .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel produced another Formula One masterclass Sunday to win the Japanese Grand Prix ahead of Red Bull teammate Mark Webber but will have to wait to secure his fourth straight world title. Nearest rival Fernando Alonso finished fourth in his Ferrari to deny Vettel the perfect finish in Suzuka, but the German has extended his lead to 90 points with a maximum of 100 available from the remaining four rounds. It was a fifth straight victory for Vettel and his fourth in five at Suzuka, but he spent most of the race in third place behind longtime leader Romain Grosjean in his Lotus and pole sitter Webber. France's Grosjean, who finished a fine third, charged into the lead from the start, while Vettel was hampered by a minor collision with Britain's Lewis Hamilton, which led to the early retirement of the Mercedes driver. Vettel conserved his Pirelli tires superbly, enabling him to make just two pit stops against three for Webber and it proved crucial. Australia's Webber, retiring from F1 at the end of the season, made desperate efforts to get on terms after his final stop and was able to pass Grosjean, but Vettel was too far ahead. ""I'm blown away with today's race,"" the champion elect said after his victory. ""I was in a bit of a sandwich with the Lotus (Grosjean) and Lewis. ""I couldn't avoid the contact. It was a horrible start but a fantastic comeback."" Vettel only needs a top-five finish in the next round in India to make sure of the title, joining compatriot Michael Schumacher and Argentina legend Juan Manuel Fangio as the only men to win four world titles in a row. Kimi Raikkonen in the second Lotus and Nico Hulkenberg for Sauber were fifth and sixth. Esteban Gutierrez of Mexico picked up his first F1 points in seventh on a fine day for Sauber with Nico Rosberg for Mercedes, McLaren's Jenson Button and Felipe Massa (Ferrari) rounding off the points scoring.

""To achieve this record and surpass John McEnroe, who we've always looked up to, is awesome,"" said Bob, who is expecting a daughter with wife Michelle in January. ""This ranks up with our record of most team titles. It shows we were consistent throughout our whole career and we didn't want to relinquish the top spot. The Bryans are the only partnership to have won 700 matches, and they have a record 19 Masters 1000 tournament titles. With the season now over, next year they can beat Pete Sampras' mark of 286 weeks at the top of the men's singles. ""Singles and doubles are totally different, but it's nice to be at the top of doubles. That's what we do and it's what we love,"" Bob said. ""I'm just grateful that we've been able to do it for so long. We've now played on tour for 13 years and have been lucky to stay healthy. We still have a great time playing so we don't plan on stopping anytime soon. When our careers are over, I think we'll look back and be proud of what we've accomplished."" They thanked their Australian coach David MacPherson, who has worked with the brothers since 2005.

"(CNN) -- The Tamil Tigers have been invited by Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa to lay down their arms after government forces retook the city of Kilinochchi Friday, once the center of power for the rebel group. Sri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapaksa has called on the Tamil Tigers to stop fighting. But while Colombo celebrated the government success with fireworks, within an hour a suicide bomber abruptly shattered whatever hopes the president may have had for immediate peace. The bomber, riding a motorcycle, blew himself up outside air force headquarters in Colombo, killing two air force police officers and a member of the bomb-disposal unit, authorities said. The new year may signal a turn in Sri Lanka's conflict -- but it is unlikely to be an end. The Tamil Tigers have their roots in the earliest days of Sri Lanka's independence in 1948. But since then they have grown from a political group intent on protecting their rights to a fierce rebel movement classified by the United States and others as a terrorist organization. The conflict between the Tigers and the government has lasted more than 25 years and left at least 65,000 people dead. The Tigers are part of the island's minority Tamils, an ethnic group that has lived on the island for centuries since their ancestors came over from southern India. These Sri Lankan Tamils are distinct from Indian Tamils, an even smaller minority, who came with the British colonists in the 19th century. Sri Lanka's majority Sinhalese have lived on the island much longer than the Tamils and represent about three-quarters of the population, according to the U.S. State Department. Most historians believe they came over from northern India in the 6th century B.C. It was Sri Lanka's post-independence government that sparked the rise of the Tamil Tigers. After 1948, Tamils started growing uneasy with the country's unitary government and apprehensive that the Sinhalese might abuse Tamil rights. They felt marginalized when S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike became prime minister after winning the 1956 elections on a platform of Sinhalese nationalism. The Tamils bristled at his declaration that Sinhala would be the official language and protested against government policies deemed favorable to the Sinhalese. Violence and radicalization started to grow during the following decades, and by the 1970s, Tamil politicians were demanding a separate Tamil state -- Tamil Eelam -- in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, the Tamils' traditional homeland. Other Tamil groups, however, sought a separate state by force. Among them were the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), founded in 1976 -- and now simply known as the Tamil Tigers. The violence still raging today intensified in 1983, when the Tamil Tigers killed 13 Sinhalese soldiers. It led to the largest outburst of violence in the island's history, with hundreds of Tamils killed, tens of thousands left homeless and more than 100,000 fleeting to south India, according to the U.S. State Department. The government began trying to suppress the Tamil Tigers in the north and east while the Tigers launched terrorist attacks in the capital of Colombo and elsewhere. Fighting has continued for the most part since then, halted briefly by a handful of peace agreements, some of them high-profile. Under an accord signed with India in 1987, the government gave in to some Tamil demands, including devolution of power to the provinces and official status for the Tamil language. But fighting continued. The Tamils fought an Indian peacekeeping force deployed in the north and east as part of the 1987 accord, and after years of bloody fighting, the Indians withdrew in early 1990. The United States designated the LTTE as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. In February 2002, Sri Lanka's government and the LTTE signed a cease-fire agreement at Norwegian-sponsored talks. But the LTTE dropped out of the negotiations a year later, claiming they were being marginalized. They launched a suicide bombing campaign the next year. The Tigers stepped up their attacks in April 2006 with an explosion at a Sinhalese market and two suicide bombings that killed a top army commander and seriously wounded another. Weeks later, the European Union designated the LTTE as a terrorist organization. Sri Lankan government forces engaged the rebels in heavy fighting in 2008 in the Kilinochchi region, once the capital and center of political power for the Tamil Tigers. The Tigers ran a parallel administration from Kilinochchi with their own police force, courts, prisons and taxes. But after Sri Lanka launched a new offensive against the rebels in the autumn, the insurgents moved their nerve center and logistics bases to Mullaitivu, on the northeastern coast. After hovering on the outskirts of Kilinochchi for more than a month, government troops retook the city. Rajapaksa declared it a ""victory against separatism"" -- but violence soon followed.","Conflict between Tamil Tigers and government has lasted more than 25 years .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic ensured he will remain world No. 1 next week after overcoming a titanic challenge from Stanislas Wawrinka to reach the U.S. Open final for the fourth year in a row. The 10th-ranked Swiss ended Andy Murray's title defense in the quarterfinals, and seemed set to inflict another major upset after winning the opening set in convincing style. But last year's runner-up Djokovic twice came from a set down to take Saturday's opening semifinal to a decider before triumphing 2-6 7-6 (7-4) 3-6 6-3 6-4. The Serbian will face Rafael Nadal in Monday's final -- a rematch of their 2010 and 2011 title clashes -- after the world No. 2 beat his childhood friend Richard Gasquet 6-4 7-6 (7-1) 6-2 in the second semi. However, the Spaniard should have less fatigue to overcome before then -- he needed just two hours 21 minutes to beat the French eighth seed, while Djokovic was on court for just over four hours in a grueling contest. He edged Wawrinka in a five-hour epic in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open in January before claiming his sixth grand slam title, but lost to Murray in the Wimbledon final in July after being drained by a five-set semi against Juan Martin del Potro. Djokovic acknowledged that he had struggled to impose himself in the match against Wawrinka. ""It was obvious Stan played more aggressive. He played better tennis,"" he said. ""I was trying to hang in there, to adjust. ""It was tough on both of us. I had to run a lot. I had to find my rhythm. I was just so fortunate to play my best tennis when I needed to."" Wawrinka said he was struggling physically with an injury picked up earlier in the New York tournament, where he reached the last four of a grand slam for the first time. ""Today I had the feeling when I was still fit, when I was still healthy, I had the match in control. I think I was playing better than him. I was doing much more things than him,"" the 28-year-old told reporters. ""But he's not No. 1 for nothing. He was staying with me all the match, and at the end he pushed me, pushed me far, far, far back. I had to find everything I had in my body today to stay with him, and he won the match.""","World No. 1 Novak Djokovic battles to a place in Monday's U.S. Open final .

"(CNN) -- Pop superstar Whitney Houston was seen ordering and consuming considerable quantities of alcohol at The Beverly Hilton two mornings last week, said a source briefed on her behavior and activity in the days before her death Saturday. The source told CNN's Don Lemon that Houston ordered the drinks before 10 a.m. last Wednesday and Thursday from the bars in the lobby and pool area. Guests both days overheard Houston loudly complaining about her drinks, accusing bartenders of ""watering down"" or ""putting too much ice"" in them, the source said Wednesday. Houston's funeral will be broadcast Saturday . The source said other guests expressed concern about Houston's erratic behavior. Her disheveled appearance, including mismatched clothing, suggested to them that she was intoxicated, the source said. The source said Houston was seen jumping in and out of the pool and doing somersaults in the pool area. The source added that Houston was alone for some of the time, but was also seen at the pool drinking with her entourage and a male companion on both days. Saturday, the day she died, Houston was seen drinking at the pool in the morning, although the source noted witnesses said her behavior did not appear erratic. A singer who participated in an impromptu duet with Houston at a party Thursday night said Houston was not behaving erratically, but did have champagne. ""I didn't see someone who was high,"" Kelly Price told CNN's ""Starting Point"" on Monday. During the party, Houston took the stage unexpectedly and sang a hoarse rendition of ""Jesus Loves Me"" with Price. Authorities are trying to determine the source of Houston's prescription medication found in the hotel room where she died, officials said Wednesday. The Los Angeles County Coroner's office has issued subpoenas seeking Houston's medical records and her prescriptions, Ed Winter, assistant chief coroner, said Wednesday. Investigators are also contacting pharmacies where the prescriptions were filled, he said. Houston, 48, was found dead in the bathtub of her suite at the Beverly Hilton on Saturday, hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammys bash at the Beverly Hills, California, hotel. Houston's death certificate, filed Wednesday, listed her cause of death as ""deferred,"" meaning it was delayed pending more information. Speculation has grown while authorities await the outcome of toxicology tests that could take weeks. See PDF file of the death certificate . Winter has said that while medication was found in the room, the amount was less than that usually present in overdose deaths. ""I know there are reports that she maybe was drowned or did she overdose, but we won't make a final determination until all the tests are in,"" Winter said earlier. He ruled out foul play and said there were no injuries to Houston's body. The prescriptions found in the room were in Houston's name, Winter told Lemon. By contacting the doctors, investigators are attempting to verify the prescriptions and find out if there were any more. Several doctors have been contacted in California and other states, along with pharmacies, he said. All were cooperating. ""The doctors I've contacted so far have been helpful,"" he said, and nothing out of the ordinary was found as long as Houston was taking the medication as prescribed. Some additional information has been gained, he said, and investigators are waiting to see Houston's medical records. It does not appear that she was ""doctor shopping,"" he said, but officials are attempting to contact as many doctors as possible to rule that out, along with determining whether Houston was filling multiple prescriptions. ""Everything is above board,"" Winter said. ""So far, nothing looks criminal."" But it was too soon to say whether Houston had any prescriptions she should not have or used an alias, he said. Although subpoenas have been issued -- a fairly unusual step in a death investigation -- Winter said the federal Drug Enforcement Administration has not been asked to assist. As part of the investigation following the death of singer Michael Jackson in 2009, bags and bottles of prescription drugs were found at Jackson's home. Local and state authorities spent months tracking the pharmacies that filled the prescriptions. One of those pharmacies was the Mickey Fine Pharmacy and Grill in Beverly Hills. One of the prescriptions found in Houston's suite was also from the Mickey Fine pharmacy, Winter said, but ""the prescription that came from Mickey Fine is not something that would kill her."" Investigators want a history of all prescriptions Houston may have filled there and at other pharmacies, and wants to make sure all of the pharmacies that filled Houston's prescriptions are accounted for. Generally, ""you go to a doctor and get a prescription, then you go to the dentist and get another prescription,"" he said. Houston visited a Beverly Hills ear, nose and throat specialist four days before she died, a source familiar with her visit said Wednesday. Dr. Shawn Nasseri has treated Houston for throat and vocal problems for several years, said the source, who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak publicly about it. Nasseri treats many well-known singers who have vocal problems, and has served as the doctor for ""American Idol"" contestants for several years. Houston's battles with drug addiction had cast a shadow in recent years over her impressive singing voice and her talent. However, a close family friend told CNN on Tuesday that Houston had not used ""hard drugs"" for several years, although she was taking medication for a throat infection and Xanax or a similar drug for anxiety and to help her sleep. The friend said Houston was also known to have a drink if she went out. The coroner's office said toxicology tests could take six to eight weeks, though Beverly Hills police Lt. Mark Rosen said that the coroner's report is expected to be finished sooner -- in two to three weeks. Winter said Wednesday his office has asked that Houston's toxicology results be expedited, saying he's hoping for a tournaround of four to six weeks, possibly sooner. ""With respect to Ms. Houston, we have an average of 50 cases a day,"" he said. ""We've got 49 other cases and families looking for results too."" A private, invitation-only funeral is planned for Houston on Saturday at New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey, where she honed her vocal skills as a child. The services are expected to be made available for television and web streaming, Houston's publicist said. Singer Aretha Franklin, Houston's godmother who is known as the ""Queen of Soul,"" has been asked to perform at the funeral service, Franklin's spokeswoman said. And Houston's cousin, singer Dionne Warwick, was in New Jersey helping the family with funeral arrangements, Warwick's publicist said. Gospel singer and pastor Marvin L. Winans will give the eulogy at the funeral at the request of Houston's mother, said New Hope Pastor Joe Carter. Winans officiated Houston's 1992 marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown, said Carter. The two divorced in 2007. Asked why no public memorial service was planned, Winans told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night the family didn't ""want to have a parade."" ""I don't think, knowing Cissy (Houston's mother) and the Houston family ... it was a matter of public or private as it was this is my daughter, this is my sister, this is my mother, this is my friend and we want to do this with dignity."" Although the family is not commenting on Houston's burial location, her death certificate filed Wednesday in Los Angeles lists it as Fairview Cemetery in Westfield, New Jersey. A message left by CNN with the cemetery office was not immediately returned. Meanwhile, Bobby Brown said in a statement Wednesday his 18-year-old daughter with Houston, Bobbi Kristina, is ""doing much better."" The teenager was twice taken to Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to be treated for stress and anxiety in the day following her mother's death. A close family friend said Tuesday that Bobbi Kristina was in the care of her grandmother, Cissy Houston, and her father. ""We continue to provide love and support to Bobbi Kristina,"" Bobby Brown's statement said Wednesday. ""She is dealing with the tragedy of her mother's death and would prefer to do it outside of the public eye. I ask again that our privacy be respected."" CNN's Stan Wilson, Alan Duke, Denise Quan and Deb Feyerick contributed to this report.","Houston ordered considerable quantities of alcohol in days before death, source says .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel thrilled his home fans by winning the German Grand Prix for the very first time in his career. The triple world champion finished ahead of Lotus pair Kimi Raikkonen and Romain Grosjean to claim his fourth win of the season and 30th overall at the Nurburgring. Victory places the Red Bull driver 36 points clear of Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, who finished fourth, ahead of polesitter Lewis Hamilton and McLaren's Jenson Button. ""It's unbelievable,"" Vettel, who lost Kers during part of the race, told reporters. ""I am very, very happy. Kimi was pushing very close in the end but I was pushing in every lap, except from the ones with the safety car. ""I enjoyed today and I could feel Kimi coming and it was quite close with Romain too, but we recovered and I am very happy the race ended after 60 laps and not 61 or 62 laps."" The safety car was enforced following a moment of comedy after 24 laps when Jules Bianchi's parked Marussia began to roll backwards across the track. With Bianchi having jumped out of his vehicle following an engine problem and small fire, the car ran backwards before hitting an advertising hoarding on the other side of the track. Earlier, Vettel's teammate Mark Webber was involved in a moment of controversy during a pit stop when his wheel flew off and hit a cameraman. Allen was treated by medics immediately with the FIA issuing a statement following the accident. It read: ""He was treated at the circuit medical center and then transported by helicopter to Koblenz Hospital. The Briton has been kept there, under observation. Further information from the hospital will be provided as soon as it becomes available."" Christian Horner, the team principle of Red Bull also confirmed to reporters that Allen had not ""suffered serious injury"". ""It's a timely reminder that working in the pit lane is dangerous,"" he said. ""Everyone reacted incredibly quickly and the most important thing is to hear that he seems to be fundamentally OK."" Tire trouble . After the six blowouts at Silverstone last weekend and the threat of a boycott by the Grand Prix Drivers Association should similar happen again, Formula One's official tire supplier Pirelli modified its rear tires with a Kevlar strip to help prevent punctures. It appeared to do the trick, although there was still stinging criticism from Hamilton, who finished fifth. ""I have nothing positive to say about these tires,"" the Mercedes driver told reporters. ""I don't understand why we struggle so much on them. But the team is working hard and we need to keep pushing. ""We didn't have any blowouts this weekend, but I don't particularly like the tires. But everyone else is getting on with them, so we have to work harder."" Meanwhile, Raikkonen has now recorded points in his past 26 races and revealed he suffered communication problems as the afternoon wore on. ""My radio only worked in one part of the circuit and unfortunately today there was quite a lot to discuss,"" he told reporters. ""It wasn't ideal. We did well but we didn't have the speed. Maybe the race could have been a little longer. The result wasn't ideal for us but we are getting back to where we should be.""","Sebastian Vettel wins German Grand Prix for first time .

"(CNN) -- He's the greatest player in the modern tennis era, perhaps even of all time, but is Roger Federer's stellar career fading to twilight? The 17-time grand slam champion is ""in a very vulnerable state"" ahead of his opening match at the U.S. Open on Monday, according to top coach Nick Bollettieri. Federer regained the world No. 1 ranking with last year's record-equaling seventh Wimbledon title, but since then he has struggled with both his game and his fitness, and is seeded just seventh for the season's closing grand slam in New York. ""Roger Federer is great for the game. He's fantastic on court and fantastic off court. He's well respected, and he respects all the opponents that he plays,"" Bollettieri told CNN. ""Roger is in a very vulnerable state. He's in a vulnerable position because he's moved down to No. 7 now. Remember Pete Sampras went through a tough period. Fortunately for Pete he won a big one before he left the tour. ""My Andre Agassi went from No. 1 to No. 142 in the world, and he left on a pretty good note. What we don't want to remember is Roger Federer leaving on a low note. ""He's been fantastic, he moves beautifully, he does everything with ease. This is a big tournament for Roger Federer."" Being seeded so low, the 32-year-old faces a possible quarterfinal clash with his old rival Rafael Nadal, who recovered from serious knee problems to retain his French Open title in June and has now bounced back from his shock first-round loss at Wimbledon with Masters victories in Montreal and Cincinnati. ""He is playing unbelievable, he has brought a new dimension to his game,"" Bollettieri said of Spain's world No. 2. ""He can move back eight to 10 feet or he comes forward and hits the ball very early. ""He's improved his serve and he's a lefty -- he's very dangerous. He's full of confidence, so watch out!"" The power of players such as Nadal is making it so much harder for the classically elegant Federer, says Bollettieri. The Swiss has this year experimented with using a bigger racquet such as his rivals employ, but has switched back again. ""When you get a Nadal hitting those heavy crosscourt lefties, and then serving out wide, it is difficult,"" said the 82-year-old, who has coached 10 world No. 1 players across the men's and women's game. ""However, I believe that the U.S. Open and the Australian Open (in January) is going to tell the story."" Federer is coached by Paul Annacone, a former student of Bollettieri who also worked with Sampras for several years. ""I believe right now Roger cannot win just standing on the baseline. I believe he has to come in,"" Bollettieri said. Bollettieri is concerned that an underwhelming end to his career could undo the Federer legacy. ""It would be a shame if people forgot who he was,"" he said. ""Look at what he brought to the game. He brought class. He lived a beautiful private life. ""He's quiet. He's always respectful of the sport. He's respectful of his opponents. You don't find too many people who represent life, whether it be business or sports, like this guy. ""[Roger] has been an ambassador on the court, and an ambassador off the court. How can you be much better than Roger Federer? He's just a credit to the tour. He's a credit to his foundation. So it'll be awful tough to replace Roger Federer."" ""The sport is very lucky to have had a Roger Federer."" While Federer's future may seem uncertain, Bollettieri said that of Serena Williams is entirely in her own hands. The world No. 1 can match Federer's grand slam haul if she retains her U.S. Open title at Flushing Meadows. She also begins her campaign Monday, along with older sister Venus. Turning 32 on September 26, Serena will be the oldest female winner of the hard-court tournament if she does triumph. The American won the French Open for the second time in June, but surprisingly lost in the last 16 at Wimbledon. Although she bounced back from that with titles in Bastad and Toronto, a defeat in the Cincinnati final to second-ranked Victoria Azarenka -- just her fourth in 64 matches this year -- again showed that she is not invincible. ""When Serena wants to play the game and she's happy within herself, to me she's the best player in the history of the game of tennis,"" said Bollettieri, who has worked with both the Williams sisters. ""When Serena's taking the ball early, she's dangerous. When she moves back behind the baseline, she's vulnerable. ""It's all up to Serena. She's won a lot of money, she's done great things for the sport, but it's what she has inside her -- does she still want to compete?"" Williams' bid for a fifth New York crown has been made slightly easier by the withdrawal of Maria Sharapova due to shoulder problems, though she has dominated the Russian in big matches. Bollettieri said Sharapova, who came to his famed Florida academy as a young girl, will always have weaknesses in her game since the shoulder surgery in 2008 that almost ended her career. ""When you have a shoulder operation, that affects the forehand and it affects the serve,"" he said. ""When you have a shoulder injury and you cannot serve big-time, you're in trouble because the returns today on the tour are dangerous. ""The girls are standing on the baseline -- if you have a tentative serve they're going to put you to sleep or put you on the defense.""","Roger Federer plays Slovenia's Grega Zemlja in his opening match Monday .

"(CNN) -- Gadget fans eagerly awaiting the next wave of Apple products just got some good news, and some bad news. First, the bad: Based on CEO Tim Cook's comments Tuesday on the company's quarterly earnings call, Apple appears unlikely to announce a major new product until this fall at the earliest. If so, that would mean the company, which typically rolls out new stuff every three or four months, will have gone an entire year -- an eternity in tech-industry time -- without launching a new gadget. And now the good: Cook also said Apple sees potential in some ""exciting new product categories."" On the surface, there's not much news in that last statement. But as the most-watched tech company in the world, Apple's every utterance is parsed for its deeper meaning. Many observers see those four words as further evidence that Apple is moving beyond laptops, phones and tablets into other areas of computing -- most likely a ""smartwatch"" that could display messages, or a long-rumored connected TV. ""Our teams are hard at work on some amazing new hardware, software and services, and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline,"" Cook said, adding ""we can't wait to introduce (them) this fall and throughout 2014."" This may just be corporate PR speak, aimed at assuaging investors concerned about Apple's plummeting stock price. But it could serve to re-energize the Apple faithful who line up to buy whatever new gizmos the company makes and may be growing impatient for new ones. Of course, Cook made similar comments early in 2012 when he said Apple was working to deliver ""some products that will blow your mind."" What followed were the usual updates to Macs and iPods, plus the iPhone 5 and the iPad Mini -- solid if not groundbreaking products. Blogosphere reaction this week to Cook's comments has been mixed. ""Apple almost never spills any beans about what its product plans are, so it's worth getting excited about fall based on Tim's willingness to talk about that specific period, as well as his mention of 'new product categories,' "" wrote Darrell Etherington in TechCrunch. ""Still, unless he's purposefully trying to throw us off the scent, people eager for new Apple products might also want to sleep through the summer."" Slate's Will Oremus thinks Cook's teases about mind-blowing future products reflect a shift in Apple's approach to promotion since co-founder Steve Jobs died in 2011. ""In the past, Apple didn't have to promise exciting new things,"" he wrote. ""It just delivered them.""","CEO Tim Cook: Apple sees potential in some ""exciting new product categories""

"(CNN) -- Over the last two decades he has been at Manchester United both as boy and man helping the club achieve the most unparallelled level of success. And on Thursday veteran midfielder Ryan Giggs took another step in further cementing his remarkable relationship with the club after he was appointed as United's player-coach by David Moyes. Welshman Giggs made his United debut in 1990 and has won 13 Premier League titles, four FA Cups and the European Champions League in 1999 and 2008, making him English football's most decorated player. Moyes was announced as the United manager in May, after fellow Scot Alex Ferguson called time on his trophy-laden 26-year reign. ""I'm delighted that Ryan has accepted the chance to become player-coach,"" former Everton manager Moyes told United's official website as the new manager steps up his preparations for his first season at Old Trafford. ""His success and ability to adapt his game over a number of years gives him an unrivaled perspective on the modern game. ""His career is an example to any aspiring young player and I'm sure that both he and the players will benefit from his new role."" Now 39, Giggs said his appointment was a ""great privilege."" The Welshman added: ""I hope I will be able to bring my experience to bear, having been both a player and part of the Manchester United family for so long. ""It's no secret that I have been taking my qualifications and I see this as the first step in my future career. I'm really looking forward to working alongside David and the team."" Former United defender Phil Neville also returns to Old Trafford as part of Moyes' staff. Neville played for the 20-time English champions between 1995 and 2005 before moving to Everton, where he played under Moyes for eight years. Moyes' first Premier League match as United manager is at Swansea City on August 17.

"Newcastle, England (CNN) -- Waving flags and chanting, far-right marchers rallied in northern England on Saturday, their numbers apparently swelled by anger over the slaying of a British soldier allegedly by attackers who claimed an Islamist motive. Protesters on the march organized by the far-right English Defence League told CNN that Wednesday's horror in southeast London's Woolwich neighborhood had opened their eyes and called for Muslims to leave. It was in Woolwich that Lee Rigby was hit by a car, then hacked to death by two men -- one of whom sought out a camera to justify the killing as ""an eye for an eye,"" saying it was ""because Muslims are dying daily."" Those two men are now under guard in South London hospitals after being shot in a confrontation with police. Three additional men were arrested Saturday on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder, according to police. Addressing the crowd Saturday in Newcastle, EDL leader Tommy Robinson said that Rigby's killing should be a wake-up call to British citizens. ""We cannot allow this soldier's death to be in vain,"" Robinson said. ""We are the only ones who dare say it. When did the truth become hate speech?"" Police said between 1,500 and 2,000 people participated in the EDL demonstration -- many more than the 300 to 500 protesters that EDL organizers told CNN ahead of the event that they were expecting. Glass bottles were thrown at one point as EDL protesters skirmished with a group of bystanders opposed to their march. A counter demonstration was held by a group called Newcastle Unites. Police estimate that 350 to 400 people took part in that event, which coincided with the far-right rally. Dipu Ahad, a Labor councilor in the city and a leader of Newcastle Unites, told CNN the EDL were ""opportunists"" who were making use of anger over the killing to push their message. Newcastle Chief Supt. Gary Calvert said the day had passed without major incident. Police made a number of arrests, mostly alcohol-related or to prevent public order offenses, he said in a statement, but the ""vast majority of those taking part were well behaved."" The march came amid concern over growing anti-Muslim sentiment as evidence emerges of apparent links between one of the two suspected attackers and radical Islamist groups. Friends, acquaintances and British media have identified 28-year-old Michael Adebolajo, a British national of Nigerian descent, as the suspect seen in the video from the scene of the Woolwich killing. He is said to be a Muslim convert. A self-proclaimed friend of the suspect was arrested Friday night at BBC Broadcasting House after giving an interview in which he said Adebolajo had been approached by Britain's domestic security service, MI5. Police said the arrest was made under the Terrorism Act and was not connected to the Woolwich inquiry. Politicians and community leaders have been trying to tamp down tensions in the wake of the murder of Rigby, a drummer and machine gunner in Britain's military, and police numbers have been boosted in vulnerable areas. Members of the EDL clashed with police near the scene of the killing late Wednesday. A tweet from its official account proclaimed then that ""it's fair to say that finally the country is waking up!:-) NO SURRENDER!"" Northumbria Police arrested three people on suspicion of posting racist tweets ahead of the EDL rally. A message posted on the EDL Facebook page Saturday urged members to abide by the law or risk arrest. ""NO swearing, NO incitement to violence, No racist remarks, No threats. Please be very aware that the authorities can, do & will monitor these pages & it seems from information we are getting are visiting and arresting people. Keep it safe please,"" it said. 'Abused in the street, online' A group which monitors incidents of anti-Muslim abuse, the Tell Mama project, said Saturday morning it had seen a huge increase in the number of reported incidents. Fiyaz Mughal, a coordinator of Tell Mama, told CNN Saturday morning that 162 incidents had been reported in the past 48 hours -- compared with four to six incidents a day on average before the Woolwich attack. The latest include street-based incidents like name calling, assaults and materials being thrown at individuals, Mughal said, as well as online incidents, where targeted hate is directed at individuals through the Internet and social media. Eight incidents of attacks against mosques across Britain are also included in the figure. Mughal, also director of an interfaith national hate crime reporting project, Faith Matters, said he had observed that people are scared, particularly female Muslims who wear headscarves and have told Tell Mama that they are afraid to go out. ""It's quite endemic,"" he said. Tell Mama recorded 632 incidents of anti-Muslim abuse in the year from March 2012, it said, about three-quarters of which occurred online. More than half were directed at women. Imams sign letter condemning attack . The apparent increase in abuse comes as Muslim leaders, as well as their Christian counterparts, seek to keep communities calm. Shaykh Shams Adduha, founder and director of Ebrahim College, which teaches Islamic studies in London, is one of nearly 100 imams and Muslim groups to have signed a letter Friday condemning the ""outrageous attack"" on Rigby and offering their condolences to his family. ""We share the absolute horror felt by the rest of British society at the sick and barbaric crime that was committed in the name of our religion. We condemn this heinous atrocity in the strongest possible terms. It is a senseless act of pure depravity worthy of nothing but contempt,"" it read. Shams Adduha told CNN Saturday that the Muslim community had reacted promptly and was working hard to defuse tensions. ""First of all we've been very open in our condemnation and very open about the fact that there is no place ... in Islam for this kind of act,"" the imam said. ""At the same time we've been calling for calm, we've constantly been talking to our communities to make sure that their fears are allayed. But of course the reactions are happening -- and they will happen."" These types of attacks are also a reaction, he said, to problems and grievances among ""angry young people out there in the world."" With regards to the Woolwich attack, he said, Muslim leaders must make clear that what happened is ""un-Islamic"" and seek to educate young people so they are not susceptible to ""fringe voices."" Prime Minister David Cameron stressed Thursday that ""the fault lies solely with sickening individuals who carried out this attack,"" adding that ""nothing in Islam ... justifies this truly dreadful act."" 'Eye for an eye' One of the attack suspects apparently approached a man filming the gory scene in the Woolwich neighborhood and suggested that Rigby had been targeted only ""because Muslims are dying daily"" at the hands of British troops like him. ""We must fight them as they fight us. An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,"" he said in the video aired by CNN affiliate ITN. Britain's armed forces have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. All its combat troops are due to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014. The identity of a second man, aged 22, seized at the scene by armed police has not been released. Both suspects were shot and remain in hospital. A third man, aged 29, who was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder on Thursday is also still in custody. Donations flood in . It is understood that the two individuals suspected of carrying out the knife and cleaver attack were known to Britain's domestic security service. They had featured in previous investigations into other individuals, but were not themselves under surveillance. CNN understands that one line of inquiry being examined in the Woolwich terror investigation is that suspect Adebolajo might have attempted -- but failed -- to travel to Somalia some time last year. The brutal slaying of Rigby near the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, a working-class, multicultural neighborhood, shocked people across the United Kingdom. The 25-year-old, who was married and had a 2-year-old son, was a machine gunner who became a recruiter. He was also a ceremonial military drummer. His family spoke Friday of their sorrow at losing a son, husband and brother who was dedicated to his job and devoted to his family. Help for Heroes, a charity which helps injured military veterans and servicemen and women, said Saturday that nearly Â£600,000 ($907,590) in public donations had poured in since the news of Rigby's murder -- with more still coming in. ""The nation has rallied behind our Armed Forces in an extraordinary and wonderful display of support,"" the charity said.

"(CNN) -- The Formula One driver merry-go-round continues apace with the news that Nico Hulkenberg is back at Force India after spending just a solitary season at Sauber. The German has signed a ""multi-year deal"" with his former marque, having spent 2011 and 2012 with the Indian-owned outfit. Hulkenberg finished tenth in the 2013 drivers' championship for Sauber, higher than both Force India's racers Paul di Resta and Adrian Sutil, who are yet to settle their futures for next season. Also currently without a seat are Sergio Perez, who was released by McLaren, Hulkenberg's former Sauber teammate Esteban Gutierrez, Marussia's British driver Max Chilton and Caterham pairing Charles Pic and Giedo Van Der Garde. Hulkenberg, who was thought to be in contention for a seat at Lotus before they signed Pastor Maldonado, told Force India's official website: ""I am happy to come back to Force India. ""The team is aiming high for next year and I believe that the experience I have gained over the years will help us achieve those goals. I genuinely believe we can have a competitive package in 2014. ""I've heard a lot of positive things about the Mercedes engine as well, so I think there is a lot to be excited about for next year. ""I know this team and I can see their determination; it's a great bunch of people and we all share the same hunger for success."" Force India said they would make an announcement on their other driver in due course, with Di Resta and Sutil both sweating on their futures. Part of the issue is a change in the way drivers are funded, with many expected to find financial backing in order to contribute towards their own drives during the season. A major rule change looms large in 2014 and that means the 11 teams are having their resources stretched, with the new turbo engines alone estimated to be three times more expensive than the ones being phased out. Force India team principal Dr Vijay Mallya said he was delighted to have Hulkenberg back in his ranks. ""When he drove for us in 2012, it became clear Nico was an exceptional talent and he has continued to impress everyone in the paddock with his strong performances this season,"" he said. ""Having Nico in our line-up is a real statement of intent and a huge boost for everyone associated with the team. ""We have high hopes and expectations for 2014 and by signing Nico we have put ourselves in the best position to achieve those objectives and enjoy what could be our most competitive season yet.""","German Formula One driver Nico Hulkenberg returns to Force India .

"(CNN) -- Injury is the biggest obstacle standing between Rafael Nadal and a record-extending eighth French Open title, according to former grand slam champion Pat Cash. The Spaniard is competing at one of tennis' four grand slams for the first time since last year's Wimbledon after spending seven months out of the sport with a knee injury. The 11-time grand slam champion survived a scare in his opener at Roland Garros before bouncing back to beat unseeded German Daniel Brands in four sets. Cash, who clinched the Wimbledon title in 1987, reckons the right knee injury which kept Nadal off the court is the biggest threat to his challenge in Paris. ""Nadal is the most incredible clay court player of modern times,"" said the CNN Open Court presenter. ""I think the only question is how fit he is. ""He certainly looks fit and he's hitting the ball unbelievably well. ""Whether his knees will hold up if he gets stuck in a couple of five-set matches, he's going to have tough matches at the French Open there's no doubt about that. ""He's proven over his career that he can do it. He's having such a long clay-court season that his fitness shouldn't be a problem. It's hard not to put him favorite."" Nadal defeated world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in last year's final to clinch an Open-era record seventh French Open title. The clay-court crown is the only grand slam missing from Djokovic's CV and cash argues the Serb is still short of rivaling Nadal on the surface. ""On clay, Djokovic has his off days, he's more up and down on clay than Nadal is,"" Cash said of the six-time grand slam winner, who notched up a straight-sets win over Belgium's David Goffin in the first round. ""It makes it much more of a challenge having Nadal there."" One man hoping to challenge for the title is Roger Federer, who eased into the third round Wednesday following a 6-2 6-1 6-1 win over Indian qualifier Somdev Devvarman. Federer, seeded second, cruised to his 56th victory at the tournament, leaving him just two wins behind the record jointly held by Guillermo Vilas and Nicola Pietrangeli. But Cash believes the 2009 winner, now 31, faces a huge task to claim an 18th major title with age beginning to catch up with him. ""Federer is starting to take quite a lot of time away from the game,"" said Cash. ""He's played so many matches, he certainly knows how to play. It's just getting enough sharp matches going into a grand slam. ""In the past he's been able to whip through the early rounds. The way Federer plays, his style, he gives players so little time to breath he's able to whip through the lesser players and it keeps him fresh for the big matches. ""As we saw at the Australian Open, it's the one time in his career he's had to play back-to-back five-set matches, which is unbelievable. ""He couldn't get through that, Andy Murray got the better of him. He is going have to start doing that now he's getting a little bit older. There are a lot of ifs and buts, it makes it interesting."" Federer will play home favorite Julien Benneteau in the next round after the Frenchman prevailed 7-6 7-5 5-7 0-6 6-4 against Germany's Tobias Kamke. France's hopes of a first men's champion in 30 years remained on course with further victories for Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Gael Monfils. Tsonga overcame Finland's Jarkko Nieminen 7-6 6-4 6-3 to set up a clash with compatriot Jeremy Chardy, while Monfils battled past Latvia's Ernests Gulbis 6-7 6-4 7-6 6-2 to earn a third round tie with Tommy Robredo. There were also victories for Serbia's Janko Tipsarevic, Spain's number four seed David Ferrer and Canada's Milos Raonic. In the women's section, Serena Williams thrashed Caroline Garcia 6-1 6-2 to set up a last-16 clash with Romania's 26th seed Sorana Cristea. The 15-time grand slam winner has now gone 26 matches without defeat. Third seed Victoria Azarenka will face 19-year-old German Annika Beck in the next round following a routine win over Elena Vesnina. Azarenka, who made the last-eight in Paris in both 2009 and 2011, claimed a 6-1 6-4 victory to set up a clash with the 2012 junior champion. But there was bad news for Caroline Wozniacki, seeded 10th, who was beaten 7-6 6-3 by world number 47 Bojan Jovanovski.","Pat Cash says injury biggest threat to Rafael Nadal's chances of glory at French Open .

"(CNN) -- Before she was even born, Micaela Bryan already had her own Twitter handle. Now just over 18 months old, she has more than 12,000 online followers. Some of them are among the biggest names in sport, including Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic. The top-ranked tennis duo have both had star billing on @micaelabryan -- and Djokovic is quite the regular guest. ""Uncle Rafa"" might have been the early inspiration, but his on-court rival ""Uncle Nole"" has made a serious play for her affection. ""Every time Novak sees her it's really funny, he'll say, 'Micaela, my little buddy, how are you doing?' and he'll go and give her a hug,"" her mom Michelle Bryan told CNN's Open Court. ""And if she doesn't give him what he wants, like a good response, he'll say, 'You've forgotten about me already.' "" But Micaela will never forget Djokovic. When she grows up she'll have a permanent record of her encounters with Serbia's favorite sporting son -- it's all documented on social media. ""My wife masterminded it,"" says Bob Bryan, one half of the most successful men's doubles partnership in tennis history. ""She got @micaelabryan before she was born and I didn't even know about it, and then we got this picture with Nadal in Miami when he was just walking through the corridor toward the locker room and he kneeled down and took a picture with her. ""He says as a joke, 'Let's put it on our Twitter account,' and we put it on and woke up the next day, she had something like 750 followers. ""So it was kind of born right then. We were like, 'Now she has all these fans we've got to keep them happy,' so we just kept getting pics with stars."" The biggest ""get"" so far is undoubtedly Roger Federer, the record-setting 17-time grand slam champion of the men's game, who was pinned down at the 2012 French Open. ""He's one of those guys, sometimes at tournaments you don't see him he's so busy,"" says Bob of the Swiss superstar, himself a father of two young girls. ""He doesn't stay at the player hotel ... you might catch him in the locker room. But we saw him hanging out at the French. He was so nice, he's like, 'Take one this way, let's try this one,' doing lots of little poses. Micaela loved him and that was a high-five moment for sure."" Bob and his twin brother Mike have had plenty of ""high-five moments"" on the court in the past year -- or, to be more accurate in their case, ""chest-bumping moments."" By winning Wimbledon in July, they became the first doubles team to hold all four grand slams and the Olympic title at the same time -- and success in their home U.S. Open this weekend would create history as they would own all four majors in a calendar year. Only one other partnership has achieved it -- Ken McGregor and Frank Sedgman in 1951 -- but the Australians did so before the advent of the professional Open era in 1969. On Monday the identical twins needed to save two set points in the opening set in a 7-6 (9-7) 6-4 victory over the British pairing of Colin Fleming and Jonathan Marray. Though doubles is considerably lower profile than singles competition, the 35-year-old brothers have both earned more than $10 million in tournament prize money on top of their endorsement deals. And both are acutely aware that, to capitalize on their playing success, they need a strong online presence. Bob (@Bryanbros) has almost 110,000 Twitter followers, Mike (@Bryanbrothers) has nearly 75,000, their Facebook page has just passed 45,000 likes and they also have an official website. ""When companies are deciding between two athletes, they'll pick the one that's got the most followers or is more active on social media. They're looking at players that give them that extra marketing pop,"" explains Bob. ""It's really important for the athletes to stay connected with the fans, they really appreciate it. It's good for promoting yourself and promoting your sport. I think companies now really understand and appreciate the value of an athlete who has a big social reach. Watch: Twin trouble for Pat Cash . ""In our contracts now -- clothing, shoes rackets -- it's all built in, the number of tweets we have to send, the number of times you have to post on Facebook."" Although he has nowhere near the online following of Nadal and Federer, who both have upward of 10 million followers on Facebook alone, Bob says he was one of the first regular tennis tweeters -- and now many players use it to communicate during the downtime of touring life. ""I had a birthday (in April) and Novak Djokovic wrote me a direct message on Twitter -- it's a way we stay connected. It's getting away from email and texts and going towards Twitter and Facebook. ""It's one of the big reasons why I decided to put my daughter on it -- it's just another way to stay active and be creative with it. I don't like to just post pictures of rackets, so if I meet someone cool, or go to an interesting place..."" Micaela, too, is getting to see the world. And she's being primed for a life in tennis -- already boasting a racket deal ""after a long 16 months of negotiations"" according to a post on her Twitter page in June. ""I played tennis my whole life so I would love for her to play tennis, because for me it was amazing,"" says mom Michelle, a lawyer who played the sport at college. ""I developed mentally, I think I benefited from it growing up, all my friends played tennis -- the culture is something I want her to experience as well. But ultimately it's up to her."" Micaela may still be getting to grips with her nascent tennis swing, but she's already a dab hand with technology -- though more often than not it ends up in her mouth. ""She's a genius with the iPhone, she loves it. She's got the swiping down,"" says Mike, as he retrieves his mobile from the baby before it receives a terminal dribbling . ""We love having her on the road. That's the only way Bob would do it. He wants to see her develop and grow up, and we've seen her first steps, we see her roll over for the first time. And I'm a good babysitter -- I ask for $100 and I'll do it."" Life on the tour can be a grind, but having a baby on board can alleviate some of the stress. ""She doesn't care if we win or lose, so it keeps things in perspective,"" says Bob. ""We lost a tough one in Monte Carlo and had seven match points. We wouldn't usually talk for a few days, but she comes running at us, gives us a hug and laughing, she doesn't care."" Micaela may soon have company on the circuit -- Michelle is pregnant again. And the brothers have no intention of quitting yet. ""We're still having fun, we're eager, we still have some goals left,"" says Mike. Bob: ""We're perfectionists, I still don't think we're playing our best tennis. There's stuff we can improve and you want to get to that level before you shut it down.""","Baby daughter of tennis star Bob Bryan has become a big hit on the internet .

"(CNN) -- Mercedes and tire supplier Pirelli have been punished by world motorsport's governing body after conducting an unsanctioned tire test. The Formula One team and Pirelli were called to an FIA tribunal following a three-day, 1,000 kilometer trial in Spain last month. The FIA ruled Friday that the German manufacturer would not be able to take part in the upcoming young driver test event, with the team also having to split costs for the tribunal equally with Pirelli and the motorsort regulator. Mercedes escaped a more severe penalty, with the tribunal having had the power to impose points penalties, fines or complete exclusion from the F1 world championship. Despite punishing Mercedes, the tribunal concluded the team had no reason to think the test contravened competition rules, which forbid unsanctioned in-season testing. It also ruled Pirelli had failed to offer other teams the chance to participate in the test. The case was brought to a tribunal after rival teams Ferrari and Red Bull lodged a protest having learned of the test at the Circuit de Catalunya. CNN's Formula One interactive . ""The Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One Team acknowledges and accepts the decision of the FIA international tribunal published today,"" read a statement from the team released on Friday. ""Mercedes accepts the proportionate penalties of a reprimand and suspension from the forthcoming young driver test that have been decided upon by the tribunal. ""Mercedes would like to once again restate its firm belief in proper due process and commend the FIA for the principle of an independent disciplinary body. ""The team would furthermore like to thank the international tribunal and its president for the fair hearing it received. ""In the best interests of the sport, the team does not intend to avail itself of any right to appeal the decision.""

"(CNN) -- Super rookie Marc Marquez is human after all. The 20-year-old missed his first chance to win the MotoGP crown as he was disqualified from the Australian Grand Prix, Sunday. The sensational Spanish rider failed to return to the Honda pits for a mandatory bike change in time and was shown the black flag. His rival Jorge Lorenzo went on to win the race from pole position to keep his hopes of defending his MotoGP title alive. The race round Philip Island off the south east coast of Australia was injected with an extra dose of drama thanks to tire trouble on the recently resurfaced circuit. With tire supplier Bridgestone unable to guarantee the safety of the rubber, race officials decided to cut the event to 19 laps and instructed the riders to make a mandatory change of bikes no later than lap 10 of the race. Lorenzo duly pitted at the end of lap 10 but Marquez made a costly error when he chose to stay out for another lap. ""The plan we had was not correct,"" the Repsol Honda rider explained on MotoGP.com. ""We thought that we could do that lap. We thought we could go into the pit at the end of lap 11. ""The problem was not with the pit board, that was fine, when I saw 'Box' I came in. Now we need to forget about it and just concentrate in [the next race in] Motegi."" Yamaha's defending champion Lorenzo is now 18 points behind his Spanish rival Marquez with two races in Japan and Spain to go in the 2013 season. ""We've been very lucky,"" said Lorenzo, who was almost toppled by Marquez when he returned to the track from this late stop. ""Without the mistake from Marc I think he would have been first or second. Now the championship has changed so much. ""Before the race we had no chance, a 2% or 3% chance and now it's 20% or 30%. But Marc is very competitive at every track, so we need to go as hard as possible at Motegi and Valencia."" Lorenzo eased to a straightforward win in the shortened race ahead of Honda's Dani Pedrosa and seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi, who are third and fourth in the driver standings. ""I'm so happy to be on the podium here at Phillip Island because it's always a great pleasure and a great atmosphere,"" said Rossi. ""I tried to give the maximum, the race was very thrilling and I enjoyed it very much. We were able to do a very good job in the pits and gain two positions.""

"(CNN) -- Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has called on the Saudi Telecommunication Authority to drop reported plans to block social media platforms, describing the action -- if implemented -- as a ""losing war."" The prince's words appear to refer to proposals thought to be under consideration by Saudi officials for tighter controls on social media, including steps that would mean Twitter users could be identified. Amanpour: Can Twitter really change Saudi Arabia? ""Dear Saudi Telecommunication Authority, social media is a tool for the people to make the government hear their voices. Just thinking of blocking them is a losing war, and a way to put more pressure on the citizens,"" the prince wrote on his Twitter account Monday. A number of Twitter users commented on this post. ""They won't succeed in blocking our voices, Twitter is our world through which we'll send our voices,"" one wrote. ""Nice of you to talk to the authority rather than talking to the decision makers,"" another commented. ""The era of blocking is over, everything is exposed now, and people will find a way to communicate, even if they had to use pigeons like the old days!"" Bin Talal announced in late 2011 that he and his investment firm, Kingdom Holding Co., had bought a $300 million stake in Twitter. Read more: Saudi activists say kingdom trying to silence them . Rights groups have criticized Saudi Arabia, a conservative kingdom, for its efforts to stifle online dissent. Freedom House, a U.S.-based free speech advocacy group, highlighted the limits imposed on free expression by Saudi Arabia in its report last year on Internet freedoms around the world, ""Freedom on the Net 2012."" The kingdom was one of a number of countries in which ""authorities imposed further restrictions following the political uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia, in which social media played a key role,"" it said. Saudi authorities have detained and intimidated hundreds of online political activists and online commentators, blocked and filtered sensitive political, religious or pornographic content from entering the Saudi Internet, and even recruited supporters online to campaign against calls for protests, the report said. Divided kingdom . Sanja Kelly, project director of Freedom on the Net, told CNN there had been an increasing number of arrests of Saudi Internet users who've posted critical remarks online, including on Twitter, since the report came out last September. According to tracking by Freedom House, 51% of Saudi Internet users are active on Twitter, which is one of the highest ratios in the world. ""The Saudi authorities have been struggling for the past several years with decisions on how to deal with the growing and increasingly critical discussions online,"" Kelly said. ""In recent months there have been increasing proposals by the authorities to either limit access to social media or to increase surveillance and decrease privacy for users."" One proposal under discussion has been the introduction of a rule requiring each Saudi Twitter user to register using government ID, she said. It has not been implemented but has attracted a lot of attention because of the popularity of Twitter in the kingdom. ""If this really comes into reality, it would be in effect a way for the government to track who's posting what,"" she said. Those at the liberal end of the spectrum in Saudi Arabia are outraged by the idea of such registration, she said. ""They feel that at the moment one of the few ways for them to vent and to engage in political conversations is through social media,"" she said. But at the other end of the spectrum, ""there are a lot of conservative voices in Saudi Arabia who are saying that social media -- Twitter in particular -- is a huge waste of time,"" and so would support this kind of measure, Kelly said. This division reflects a broader cleavage in Saudi society between progressives who are trying to push the boundaries of what is allowed and more conservative elements who are trying to maintain the status quo and see social media as a threat, she added. Up to now, Saudi authorities have been able to identify more prominent social media users, but a change in the rules might mean those who post online under the cover of anonymity are also exposed, she said. A likely consequence would be increased self-censorship. Bin Talal, who is one of many Saudi princes, is more prominent in business circles, Kelly added, so his more progressive views do not necessarily represent what is being discussed among the ruling elite.","NEW: Tension over social media freedoms reflects divisions in Saudi society, analyst says .

"(CNN) -- The FBI found ""very low concentrations"" of ricin on letters sent this week to President Obama, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and a gun control group, a spokesman said Friday. Mayors Against Illegal Guns was founded by Bloomberg. FBI spokesman Christopher Allen said lab results showed small amounts of ricin on the three letters. Meanwhile, in what appears to be a separate incident of possibly poisoned mailings in Washington state, the FBI confirmed the presence of ricin on a letter sent to Fairchild Air Force Base near Spokane, the agency said. One front of the FBI investigation advanced Friday in Texas, where authorities searched the home of a man in New Boston in connection with the threatening letters to Obama and Bloomberg. FBI agents interviewed the man after his wife contacted authorities, saying she had found suspicious containers in their New Boston home, two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. One of the two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were questions about what the man's wife told authorities. ""We're looking at the credibility of the complainant and using due diligence,"" the official said. Both sources told CNN that the wife told authorities she found a suspicious container and ricin research on their computer. Word of the search in Texas comes a day after the FBI said its agents were looking for a letter sent to the CIA that they believe is similar to other letters, mailed from Spokane, Washington, that contained the deadly toxin. In all, at least 10 ricin-laced or suspected ricin-laced letters have been sent to government officials in recent weeks, including Obama.

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel is so dominant in Formula One right now that his rivals must be hoping for help from the heavens, but even the weather seems unlikely to stop the Red Bull driver from a fourth successive win at Sunday's Korean Grand Prix. A typhoon had been forecast to hit this week in Yeongam, but conditions have died down -- although there is still a possibility of rain during the race. Vettel, however, was unconcerned after clinching his sixth pole position of 2013 with another commanding performance in Saturday's qualifying at the Korean International Circuit. The German headed off Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton, who was fastest in Friday's second practice, while Red Bull teammate Mark Webber was third fastest -- though the Australian will start 13th on the grid after his third reprimand of the season at Singapore. Interactive: F1 gears up for more Gangnam Style . ""It's not a disaster if it starts to rain,"" Vettel told reporters after setting pole for the third successive race, at a venue where he has won the past two years. ""Same as usual we have rain tires in the garage but obviously they're talking about heavy wind. ""I arrived on Wednesday and it was very, very windy. Since then the wind seems to have died down and I think the typhoon has changed direction. I think tomorrow should be fine in terms of conditions -- whether it is dry or wet. ""If we get some of the rain from the typhoon isn't 100% clear at the moment but, as I said, it doesn't matter. Most important is that we did the job."" Hamilton also had five pole positions going into qualifying, but was just over two-tenths of a second slower than Vettel -- who leads the championship by 60 points as he seeks a fourth successive world title. ""We did as good a job as we could,"" said 2008 world champion Hamilton. ""I felt like I got the most out of the car and perhaps there's always a little bit of room to improve but in general it's been a good weekend so far, so I really hope that tomorrow we're able to fight with them."" Webber is paying the price for receiving a lift from Ferrari's Fernando Alonso following his car's late failure in Singapore, an act of friendship that left both drivers in trouble with the race stewards. ""We had to take a bit of pace out of the car for qualifying. Not much but just looking at how we would compromise qualifying a little bit more for the race,"" said the 37-year-old, who has six races left before quitting F1 to drive for Porsche in the World Endurance Championship. ""I think the race will be interesting. Obviously well and truly out of position but we will fight and come back through."" Lotus' Romain Grosjean will head the second row after qualifying fourth, followed by Mercedes' Nico Rosberg and Alonso -- who criticized tire supplier Pirelli after being more than 0.8 seconds slower than Vettel. ""It's a tire that cannot do five kilometers. If you push them, you finish them -- which is not normal,"" said the two-time world champion, who won the inaugural Korean race in 2010. ""I'm sure all the cars, if they pushed 100% from the start of a lap, they would not do five kilometers. So it is not very helpful and not very nice to drive like this, at 95% of the lap. ""We are getting used to them being unable to last one lap, getting used to these marbles (rubber debris on the track) so you have two meters of racing line. Three or four years ago no-one would have thought this was possible."" Alonso's teammate Felipe Massa will start sixth ahead of Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg and Esteban Gutierrez.

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel has at times made his domination of Formula One look effortless, but the triple world champion insists his supremacy is the result of tireless work from his all-conquering Red Bull team. The German has taken the checkered flag at each of the last three grands prix, extending his lead at the top of the drivers' championship to 60 points with just six races of the 2013 season remaining. With a fourth consecutive world title all but in the bag, Vettel has paid tribute to the team which have powered his RB9 car to the front of the grid. ""I have very little information about what others are doing, but I can say that we're one of the hardest working teams and thus deserve to be where we are right now,"" the 26-year-old told F1's official website. ""This is not only a question of quantity -- how many more hours you put in -- but very much about quality."" Vettel's occupation of the podium has led to a backlash from some fans, with the former Toro Rosso driver consistently booed by fans during the season. He was most recently jeered after winning the Singapore Grand Prix. Vettel is unmoved by the negativity, putting it down to fans who are disappointed with him consistently finishing ahead of their favorite drivers. ""I am relaxed about it,"" he said. ""I think the media exaggerate this matter. It is not that hordes of people boo -- it is only a small percentage. ""And isn't it so that every fan has the right to cheer for his own team and show disappointment when the others win? I think those who booed were Ferrari fans who obviously were disappointed that we again finished ahead of them. ""No big deal for us. The thing that matters is to know that we again did everything right -- that you can be satisfied with your performance."" Vettel's nearest rival Fernando Alonso, who drives for Ferrari, hasn't given up hope of clinching his third world championship going into this weekend's Korean Grand Prix. And the Spaniard is urging his team to take heart from Oracle Team USA's incredible comeback recently against Emirates Team New Zealand in sailing's America's Cup. The Americans trailed 8-1 before roaring back to retain the Auld Mug trophy. ""The president (Luca di Montezemolo) and me think anything can happen,"" Alonso told Autosport.com. ""Like the America's Cup, we saw the American team was 1-8 down and they won 9-8. ""We know it would be difficult, but if you have two lucky races, things can change very quickly. But we need a lot of luck; we know that. ""We need to be realistic because we don't have the pace to beat them in normal conditions, so we need luck in all six races. ""If we have luck, everybody can be sure that we will be there to take [advantage]. We will not give up until it's mathematically impossible.""","Sebastian Vettel says Red Bull's F1 dominance is down to hard work .

"Washington (CNN) -- If at first you succeed, then by all means, try, try again. President Barack Obama returned to a successful strategy from last year's election campaign by calling Friday for college students and their families to mount pressure on congressional Republicans to prevent a jump in some student loan rates set to occur on July 1. ""Higher education cannot be a luxury for a privileged few,"" he said at the White House with college students standing behind him. ""It is an economic necessity that every family should be able to afford, every young person with dreams and ambitions should be able to access and now's not the time for us to turn back on young people."" The Rose Garden appearance angered GOP leaders, who contend they have proposed a reasonable solution. ""No one should be fooled by today's campaign-style event at the White House,"" said a statement by Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. He added that Obama ""appears more interested in needlessly stoking partisan divisions in Washington than helping young Americans avoid a higher interest rate on their student loans."" The issue is both practical and political. Student loan mess: What's at stake? If Congress doesn't act in coming weeks, interest rates on government-subsidized Stafford loans for college students will double from the current 3.4% to 6.8% starting in July. Only students taking out new subsidized loans after July 1 would be affected, as those getting unsubsidized loans already pay the 6.8% rate. About 7 million students, a third of the total taking out loans, would be affected. Obama said Friday the impact would mean those students needing subsidized loans would have to pay about $1,000 more a year. When he asked how many in the crowd could afford that, several heads shook ""no."" To qualify for subsidized Stafford loans, students must meet an income threshold. The event allowed Obama to revert to a topic he benefited from in his successful re-election campaign last year, and to divert attention from controversies dogging his administration early in his second term such as IRS targeting of conservative groups and secret subpoenas of journalists' phone records. Republicans argue that Obama basically agrees with their approach, which would tie the student loan rate to economic factors instead of leaving it up to Congress. However, the two sides remain at odds over specifics including how fast and high the interest rates could rise. A measure recently passed by House Republicans would mean that the rate for all new student loans would be about 5% for the first year, but would likely rise in the future because it would be linked to the rate on 10-year Treasury bonds, which currently are low. Obama's budget proposal for next fiscal year would hold down rates for subsidized loans to about 3% in the first year, with other students paying about 5%. Those rates also would be linked to the 10-year Treasury bond levels and therefore would likely increase in future years. The president criticized the House GOP proposal as ""not smart"" and ""not fair,"" saying it would increase the burden on middle- and lower-income families to pay for a college education. He reminded listeners that their pressure last year persuaded legislators to extend the current 3.4% rate on subsidized loans through June instead of letting it double in 2012. ""You're going to have to call them up again or e-mail them again or tweet them again and ask them 'what happened, what changed?'"" Obama said. Differences between the two sides involve when the rate on a loan gets locked in, with Obama calling for it to happen right away while the House measure would allow it to rise until a student graduates. Another difference concerns maximum rates. The House measure would cap interest rates at 8.5% for student loans while the Obama proposal would contain no such cap but would include a program to limit a former student's annual expenditures on the loan to no more than 10% of discretionary income. A House GOP aide noted that the Democratic-controlled Senate has yet to act on the issue, and echoed McConnell's statement in saying that the House and Obama agree on the principle of tying the student loan rate to economic factors. Later Friday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, announced he planned for the chamber to vote next week on a Democratic measure to extend the current 3.4% rate for subsidized loans for two years, which would put off the matter until after the 2014 congressional elections. The measure would eliminate some tax breaks, including one for oil companies, to pay the federal cost of extending the lower interest rate. Such tax components appear certain to ensure Republican opposition. Meanwhile, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced Friday it was launching ads in six college newspapers that urge students to pressure Congress to keep loan rates low. CNNMoney's Jennifer Liberto and CNN's Ted Barrett, Deirdre Walsh and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","President Obama urges students to pressure congressional Republicans .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic will head to London to defend his ATP World Tour Finals crown on a high after winning back the Paris Masters title Sunday. The Serbian ended David Ferrer's reign in Bercy, winning the final 7-5 7-5 in just under two hours to become only the 15th tennis player to hold 40 ATP Tour titles. He kept alive his hopes of ending the year as world No. 1 for the third consecutive time by defeating the man who made it possible -- Ferrer eliminated top-ranked Rafael Nadal in Saturday's semis. The Australian Open champion has now won six titles this year, having also reached the finals of the U.S. Open and Wimbledon. ""I am definitely playing the best tennis this year now,"" said Djokovic, who also won the 2009 Paris title. ""I'm playing on a very high level and have lots of confidence in myself, in my game."" Djokovic has won 17 matches in a row since losing to Nadal in New York, and has a 66-9 record this year. On Tuesday he will start his London campaign against Roger Federer, who he beat on Saturday, while Ferrer faces a rematch with Nadal in the other four-man group. ""I played maybe better than yesterday, and I lost,"" said world No. 3 Ferrer. ""I am happy with my game, because the last few tournaments I played well and I am happy with myself."" The Bryan brothers will go to London as clear favorites in the doubles after thrashing their closest rivals Alexander Peya and Bruno Soares 6-3 6-3 in Sunday's Paris final. Mike and Bob have almost double the ranking points of the Austrian/Brazilian duo, who will make their debut in the season-ending event. ""We're very happy with our performance against a team that has had a fantastic year and who is playing with a lot of confidence at the moment,"" Bob Bryan said ahead of his 11th appearance. Meanwhile, Italy clinched a fourth Fed Cup title Sunday, beating a weakened Russia team 4-0 in Sardinia. World No. 7 Sara Errani clinched her country's first women's crown since 2010 by beating 183rd-ranked Alisa Kleybanova 6-1 6-1. The second reverse singles was not played, but Karin Knapp and Flavia Pennetta beat Margarita Gasparyan and Irina Khromacheva in the dead doubles rubber. Russia's top 11 players were unavailable for the final, which clashed with the WTA Tour's Tournament of Champions in Bulgaria. Simona Halep capped her breakthrough season by claiming her sixth title and passing $1 million in prize money this year as she came from behind to beat former U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur 2-6 6-2 6-2 on Sunday. It will move the 22-year-old up to 11th in the rankings, putting her within touching distance of becoming just the third Romanian player to crack the WTA's top 10. She is managed by one of the other two, Virginia Ruzici -- the only Romanian woman to win a grand slam title. ""Hopefully I can play next year like I played this year and do well in Australia,"" Halep said. Former world No. 4 Stosur also lost to Halep in last month's Kremlin Cup final, having won the Osaka title before that.","World No. 2 Novak Djokovic wins the Paris Masters title for the second time .

"(CNN) -- An app that helps users find other apps for free has been banned from Apple's mobile store in a move some say heralds a new round of blacklisting for content the company doesn't like. AppGratis, which partners with app developers as a sort of clearinghouse to help them get noticed, was first informed Friday that it was being pulled, according to CEO Simon Dawlat. The app disappeared from the App Store on Sunday. Dawlat said he'd been on a plane to Brazil and arrived to discover more than 75 missed phone calls and ""a seemingly unlimited flow"" of text messages. ""I immediately thought that someone in my family had passed away during my flight and couldn't touch my phone for a few minutes,"" Dawlat wrote in a blog post. ""Scared. Paralyzed. Trying to imagine what the terrible news could be."" Apple said the app, created in 2008, was pulled for violating a pair of its developer guidelines -- one that bars displaying apps for purchase ""in a manner similar to or confusing with the App Store"" and another that bans push notifications that contain advertising or ""marketing of any kind."" Dawlat said that Apple had approved an iPad version of the app, which has roughly 12 million iOS users, just a week before the apps were banned. Apple did not immediately respond Wednesday to a request for additional comment. Dawlat said the company has addressed the App Store issue before, apparently arguing successfully that AppGratis isn't similar to Apple's closely policed sales environment. As far as push notifications, he said the app sends one a day, saying ""today's deal is here,"" and that users can opt out of getting it. Talking to an Apple contact didn't make it any clearer, he wrote. ""I asked how he and his team could have possibly changed their minds overnight, pretty much pulling the plug on a 45-person company,"" Dawlat said. ""He seemed very detached regarding the gravity of the situation, and was unable to let me know on what specifics these decisions had been made."" Dawlat questioned why similar apps hadn't been banned. According to at least one report, it might not be long. Wall Street Journal's All Things D blog reported that the ban was the first step in a new wave crackdowns by Apple on ""app-discovery"" apps. Citing ""sources familiar with Apple's thinking,"" the report said Apple thinks those apps ""threaten the legitimacy of the App Store"" by letting developers pay their way to a high ranking. Apple famously keeps tight controls on its App Store, not allowing any app in without prior approval. The company argues it's a quality-control issue that keeps out sub-standard content. Many critics prefer a more open-ended approach like Google's Play Store for Android devices, which give developers significantly more leeway. Dawlat said AppGratis will continue to be updated for people who have already downloaded it and that he'll keep trying to work with Apple to find a solution.","Apple bans app that helps users find other apps for free .

"(CNN) -- The American dream of holding two Formula One races next season has been kept alive after a new Grand Prix of America was added to the 2014 calendar. There had been fears that the new race on the East Coast would not go ahead after Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone told CNN last month that race organizers had not raised enough money to fund it. An inaugural grand prix in New Jersey has now been included in the record-breaking 22 race calendar issued by motorsport's global governing body, the FIA, Friday. ""The entire Grand Prix of America team is thrilled to join the 2014 FIA calendar and we look forward to bringing world class Formula One racing to New Jersey,"" race promoter Leo Hindery, Jr. said. But the race, scheduled for 1 June, has a provisional status which means it could still be dropped from the sport's global tour. Mexico has also been penciled in to stage a grand prix for the first time since 1992, when the event was held in Mexico City. A provisional race in 2014 has been given a date of 16 November. Korea, the destination for the next race of this season, has been moved forward to April and has also been given provisional status on the 2014 calendar. F1 returned to the U.S. in 2012 with the inclusion of the U.S. Grand Prix held at a new circuit just outside Austin, Texas. The Grand Prix of America is planned to be held on 3.2 miles of public roads in Port Imperial, a district in the New Jersey towns of West New York and Weehawken. It snakes alongside the Hudson River and would give the race a spectacular backdrop of Manhattan's historic skyline. Construction on the site is well under way, and last year three time world champion Sebastian Vettel and former F1 driver David Coulthard drove demonstration runs on the circuit for the Red Bull team. However, a lot of the work has focused on the pit building in a new block of garages which was already planned to be built. The FIA will need to approve the site before it is given the green light in 2014. The New Jersey race has already been postponed once, having been initially scheduled for June this year. The wheels started to come off in August 2012 when Tom Cotter, the president of the race, unexpectedly resigned. It was recently revealed that the Grand Prix of America organizers appointed investment bank UBS in June to raise $100 million which is required for the race to go ahead. The 2014 Formula 1 calendar features a record 22 races, starting in Australia on 16 March with a finale in Brazil on 30 November. Austria also makes a return to the calendar in June -- a race that has not been given provisional status. The return of Austria means Red Bull, whose F1 team has won the drivers' and constructors' titles for the past three years, can look forward to a home race. The race will be held at the Red Bull Ring, which staged the Austrian Grand Prix between 1970 and 1987 in its former guise as the Osterreichring. Pirelli rubber to stay . The meeting of the FIA's World Motor Sport Council in Croatia also confirmed Pirelli will continue as F1's sole tire supplier in 2014. The Italian company's future in the sport was in doubt after a series of blow-outs wreaked havoc at the British Grand Prix and led to fears that the drivers' safety was being compromised. Earlier in the season, a spate of worryingly delaminations -- where the tire layers separate -- had already led to worries the tires were not safe. But Pirelli have since introduced a new tire structure for the second half of the season and the FIA has agreed the company will continue to showcase its rubber in motorsport's elite racing series. The FIA said in a statement: ""In order to cover the transition period and considering the contracts already settled by FOM and the teams with Pirelli, the WMSC confirmed that Pirelli may continue to supply tires to competitors in the FIA F1 World Championship, subject to the requisite technical and safety standards of the FIA being met."" The FIA also announced that, along with the company headed by F1's commercial boss Ecclestone, it had also agreed a ""strong and stable sporting governance framework."" The deal known as the Concorde Agreement effectively splits the sport's commercial revenues between the governing body, Ecclestone's group and the teams. The FIA revealed it would have a larger share of the pie, stating: ""This agreement provides the FIA with significantly improved financial means."" F1 generates more than $4bn in revenues annually -- and with more races in 2014 that sum could be set to rise.","A new Grand Prix of America is added to the 2014 Formula One calendar .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Elvis Presley's death became a controversy at the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial as a man who promoted both artists' last tours testified. AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware testified Wednesday that Presley died of a drug overdose, but when his own lawyer questioned him Thursday he changed his testimony to say Elvis died of a heart ailment. Presley collapsed in the bathroom of his Memphis, Tennessee, mansion -- Graceland -- on August 16, 1977, at the age of 42. While his death was ruled the result of an irregular heartbeat, the autopsy report was sealed amid accusations that abuse of prescription drugs caused the problem. How Presley died is relevant because Jackson lawyers argue Gongaware's experience as Elvis's promoter should have made him more aware of drug abuse by artists, including Michael Jackson. He was in charge of producing Jackson's ""This Is It"" concert when Jackson died on June 25, 2009, at the age of 50. The coroner ruled his death was caused by a fatal combination of sedatives and the surgical anesthetic propofol. Dr. Conrad Murray told investigators he gave Jackson nightly infusions of propofol to treat his insomnia. He was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, sentenced to four years in prison. Promoter grilled about 'smoking gun' e-mail in trial . Jackson's mother and children are suing AEG Live, contending the concert promoter is liable in his death because it negligently hired, retained or supervised Dr. Murray. AEG Live lawyers argue their executives had no way of knowing -- or reason to suspect -- that Jackson was abusing drugs as he prepared for the ""This Is It"" concerts they were promoting and producing. ""I had no idea"" Jackson was using propofol in the weeks before his death, Gongaware testified. Although he worked advance promotion on Elvis Presley's last tours -- under the direction of Presley manager Colonel Tom Parker -- Gongaware testified he never met Presley. ""Did you understand he had a problem with drugs?"" AEG lawyer Marvin Putnam asked. ""I understood that later,"" Gongaware said. ""There was a period of time when we didn't work. I didn't understand at the time, but I learned that it was a drug problem and the Colonel said he couldn't work."" Jackson lawyer Brian Panish confronted Gongaware with two e-mails he sent two weeks after Jackson's death in response to condolence messages from friends. They both read: ""I was working on the Elvis tour when he died so I kind of knew what to expect. Still quite a shock."" But under questioning from Putnam, Gongaware said he didn't mean that he expected Jackson to die like Elvis. He was referring to the trauma of people losing their jobs because a tour is canceled, he said. Promoter: 'I kind of knew what was going to happen' to Jackson . 'I don't recall' AEG's lawyer tried to rehabilitate Gongaware's credibility with jurors, who sometimes laughed at his repetition of ""I don't recall"" several dozen times under questioning by Panish. After the jury left the courtroom Wednesday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelas commented on the number of ""I don't recall"" responses. ""We've had a lot of that,"" she said. ""How much more of that?"" ""Why could you not recall e-mails?"" Putnam asked him Thursday. ""I had not reviewed them and had not seen them in years,"" Gongaware answered. Some of the e-mails were new to him because he was so busy putting Jackson's tour together that he never read them, he said. ""Mostly, it was just a time factor if it was something that didn't have to do with me."" Outside of court, Panish suggested it was Putnam's job as Gongaware's lawyer to prepare him by having him review e-mails before questioning. CNN exclusively obtained video of Gongaware's deposition recorded in December and played this week for jurors. Gongaware struggled in the deposition when Panish asked him about the e-mail Jackson lawyers call their ""smoking gun"" -- because it contradicts AEG's argument that they never hired or supervised Dr. Murray. They say Gongaware's e-mail, sent 11 days before Jackson's death, shows AEG Live executives used Murray's fear of losing his lucrative job as Jackson's personal physician to pressure him to have Jackson ready for rehearsals despite his fragile health. It was Gongaware's reply to an e-mail from show director Kenny Ortega expressing concerns that Murray had kept Jackson from a rehearsal the day before. Ortega also raised his own concerns about Jackson's health. ""We want to remind (Murray) that it is AEG, not MJ, who is paying his salary. We want to remind him what is expected of him,"" Gongaware wrote. But in his video deposition he said he could not remember writing it. After conceding that he wrote it, Gongaware then seemed unable to explain what he meant by the e-mail. AEG exec called Jackson 'freak' before signing concert contract . ""He needs cheeseburgers"" AEG Live's production manager for Jackson's tour e-mailed Gongaware 10 days before Jackson's death that perhaps what the singer needed to turn around his deteriorating health was to be feed some junk food: ""He needs some cheeseburgers with a bunch of Wisconsin cheesehead bowlers... and a couple of brats and beers. Jeez."" John ""Bugzee"" Houghdahl wrote a more serious assessment of Jackson's condition four days later: ""I have watched him deteriorate in front of my eyes over the last 8 weeks. He was able to do multiple 360 spins back in April. He'd fall on his ass if he tried now."" Gongaware testified that he disagreed with Houghdahl's opinion, saying he had no ""particular concern"" about Jackson's health and ability to perform. MJ looked 'Skeletal' AEG Live President Randy Phillips sent Gongaware an e-mail after Jackson's death to make sure he did not use certain rehearsal video in the ""This Is It"" documentary because it made Jackson look too thin: . ""Make sure we take out the shots of MJ in that red leather jacket at the soundstage where the mini-movies were being filmed. He looked way too thin and skeletal."" Gongaware testified that he did not know why Phillips would ask that. ""We didn't keep anything out based on what Randy wanted."" Another e-mail suggested Gongaware was concerned that musicians, dancers and singers who worked on the show might tell interviewers after Jackson's death that he was unhealthy at rehearsals. ""The only thing we ask is that they keep it positive and stress that MJ was active, engaged, and not the emaciated person some want to paint him as being,"" he wrote in an e-mail approving their interviews. Gongaware is expected to remain on the witness stand through Monday.","AEG Live Co-CEO promoted last tours of Elvis and Michael Jackson .

"(CNN) -- Prime Minister Julia Gillard of Australia has described as ""inaccurate"" a TV report alleging that several government institutions including the country's main spy agency fell victim to foreign cyberattacks. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation's investigative program Four Corners reported that hackers, thought to be from China, had breached government agencies including the prime minister's office and cabinet, as well as the departments of foreign affairs and defense. The most striking element in the report was the allegation that a cyberattack from a server in China stole the blueprints to the new headquarters of the ASIO, Australia's top intelligence organization, including details on the building's security and communications systems, its floor plan and the locations of its servers. But Gillard sought to play down the TV program's claims. Australia the 'lucky country' for a better life: survey . ""There were a number of unsubstantiated allegations of hacking in the Four Corners report as the attorney general has stated,"" she said, according to CNN affiliate Network Seven. ""Neither he or the director general of ASIO intend to comment further on these inaccurate reports."" At a foreign ministry news conference Tuesday, Chinese officials called the report a ""baseless accusation."" ""Since the attacks are technically untraceable, it's difficult to find the origin of these attacks,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei. ""I don't know where does the evidence come from for media to make such reports."" Hong added that cybersecurity is an issue internationally and it calls for a ""calm and thorough discussion."" ""Making baseless accusation will not help to improve the current situation,"" he said. Earlier this month, the United States accused China of trying to extract sensitive information from U.S. government computers. A Pentagon report said China was carrying out the attacks in an effort to extract information from ""diplomatic, economic and defense industrial base sectors that support U.S. national defense programs."" At the time, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said China was ""firmly against any forms of cyberattacks."" Beijing has in the past insisted that China is the victim of cyberattacks, most originating in the United States.

"(CNN) -- Remember when you were 12 years old and you'd pass notes in class, making snide remarks about members of the opposite sex? Remember the electricity that shot through school when word went around that there was going to be a schoolyard rumble? Remember the rollercoasters of emotions, the whispers of gossip, the crying because your best friend betrayed you, the molehills made into mountains? If life is just like high school, then the Internet might be an age group lower. Much of our digital world means never having to leave junior high school behind. Sure, the Web has plenty of mature, resourceful people who create clever online projects or crowdsource solutions to global problems. But some experts also believe it perpetuates childhood. Janet Sternberg, a communications professor at Fordham University in New York who's written a great deal about online civility, sees a reverse of a pattern created by television. If, as cultural critic Neil Postman asserted, TV ended childhood -- the medium provided an impetus for young people to act older, which created hand-wringing about generations growing up too quickly -- the Internet has done the opposite, she says. ""The Internet and digital media have produced this 'Peter Pan effect' where we never grow up, we're perpetual children, we never have to be responsible for anything -- we keep this juvenile mentality,"" she says. Indeed, the Web has a clique for every would-be adolescent -- class clowns, bullies, drama queens and fanboys. (There's plenty of room for geeks and nerds, too.) They all get to indulge in their petty squabbles, and few of them show signs of growing up. Looking for a fight on the playground blacktop? Check out Facebook and Twitter, where complete strangers assault each other with name calling. Want to be part of the popular crowd? Try YouTube, full of instant celebrities who have done little except mix Diet Coke and Mentos in their mouths. Meanwhile, mainstream news and culture sites indulge in instant-gratification come-ons, from car-crash videos to galleries of kittens and puppies. Of course, if you don't like any of it, you're free to post in the comments, where the level of discourse is somewhere between ""This sucks"" and ""You suck."" It's all instantaneous, thanks to the always-on aspect of digital media -- available at the swipe of a smartphone. Who needs to think? ""We say whatever's on our mind,"" says Sternberg. ""Restraint is one of the signs of adulthood, and our whole culture is celebrating a lack of restraint."" A squirt of dopamine, a shot of attention . Of course, why wouldn't it? It's really two distinct if not unrelated issues. On the one hand, there's the concept of immediate satisfaction. It's in the very core of our lizard brains, the cries of ""Act now!"" and ""Just do it,"" the things that give us a squirt of dopamine and keep us coming back again and again. Marketers and media people have always known its value, and the Internet -- in the form of catchy headlines and eye-grabbing, multi-frame galleries -- does this very well. And then there's the stuff that appeals to us on a gut level, whether it's graphic images, blunt language or a longing for attention. Perversely, it sometimes creates an antagonistic response: A recent Pew survey noted that a distinguishing aspect of Twitter chatter is its ""overall negativity."" ""Twitter users are not representative of the public,"" the survey hastened to add. But Twitter users' voices are often picked up by the wider media, which makes the wisecracks and incivility conveyed on the service even more attractive to attention-getters. And around and around we go. Besides, attention is a good thing, right? We all want to be popular, enjoy a taste of celebrity. Digital life celebrates viral videos and Facebook memes. Does it matter what you said? No -- what matters is how many people hear you say it. It all contributes to a potent mix, says Susan Douglas, a communications professor at the University of Michigan. ""It's this weird moment,"" she says, reeling off such facets as the rise of youth culture, the spread of celebrities oriented to youth, politically oriented dismissals of fact and the 140-character Twitter culture. With ""a rise of incivility that is completely accepted and enabled by social media, you have some kind of a brew here."" However, it's a brew that gets eyeballs -- and that's what matters to many websites, says Fairfield University communications professor Michael Serazio. ""What do audiences reward?"" he asks, observing that an 8,000-word investigative piece will usually lose out to a zingy tweet. As the media environment gets faster and faster -- now we also have 6-second Vines -- nobody wants to be the guy who passes around articles that get dismissed by commenters with ""tl;dr"" (too long; didn't read). So we end up back in the schoolyard. Says Serazio, ""We reward the emotional over the rational."" Figuring things out . Sure, you've probably heard some of these complaints before, the grousing of elders and eggheads about those darn kids and their clothes and their hair and their newfangled technology. Critics deplored newspaper tabloids, which catered to first-generation immigrants learning the language and time-pressed laborers grabbing a few minutes to read lurid headlines on the train. In the early '60s, FCC Chairman Newton Minow famously called television ""a vast wasteland,"" echoing the thoughts of many who had hoped that the medium would bring about a golden age of entertainment and enlightenment -- not ""The Real McCoys"" and ""Clutch Cargo."" It's always something, the elitists charge. Still, like television in the 500-channel era, the Internet is many things, many of them worthwhile. Along with the spitball-blowers and OMG hyperventilators, there are smart sites that use smart prose and smart graphics (and are quite capable of satirizing everybody else). They're the kids who are actually trying to learn something -- respect for others, at the very least. OK, so they can sometimes be goody-two-shoes. And their voices often get drowned out by the unruly din of the digital masses. Does that mean they should end up at wrong end of wedgies? Class? Class? Will class ever come to order? Rachel Weingarten, a marketing strategist, sees some signs that the Internet is wising up a little. Some of her clients, she says, are trying to use thoughtful whispers rather than sledgehammer amplification, talking up to customers rather than talking at them. The reverse didn't work, she says. One well-known candy gave its front page over to a Twitter feed, inviting ""every 14-year-old idiot on Earth"" to talk smack about the brand. Now, ""the boutique brands are saying, help us find our niche, and help us keep connected,"" she says. ""People no longer want the big campaign. People now want you to help figure out who they are again."" In other words, they're growing up. Michigan's Douglas also credits some of the Internet's noise to uncertainty. Web users are still figuring out whom to trust, how to communicate, what this new (and it IS still new) technology can do. They're like a bunch of kids getting their first surge of hormones. They won't always be bouncing off the walls. But, in the meantime, it's going to take some work to leave the schoolyard. Sternberg, for one, isn't optimistic. She mentions Freud and his ""Civilization and Its Discontents,"" which argues that civilization relies on restraint of childish behavior. The Internet, of course, is just a reflection of our larger civilization -- and she doesn't like what she sees. ""The idea that being an adult is prized in our culture -- that idea is evaporating,"" she says. ""It's really uncool.""","People engage in juvenile behavior online, even if they're adults .
Internet and digital media have produced ""Peter Pan effect,"" says one observer .

"London (CNN) -- Prince William of Wales slipped a gold ring onto the finger of Catherine Middleton Friday, and the couple vowed to love, comfort, honor and to keep each other in London's biggest royal wedding in three decades. Bells pealed over central London and flag-waving crowds roared in excitement Friday as Middleton arrived at Westminster Abbey to marry William, the second in line to the British throne. Middleton wore an ivory and white satin dress with lace sleeves and shoulders, designed by Sarah Burton of the Alexander McQueen fashion house. Royal wedding: The big day . ""You look beautiful,"" the prince told her as she arrived at the altar on the arm of her father Michael. William wore the uniform of a colonel of the Irish Guards, a scarlet jacket and blue sash, as his brother, Prince Harry, accompanied him into the abbey. Crowds cheered as his car drove the short distance from Clarence House to the abbey before the wedding, and they roared and waved as the newlyweds rode in an open carriage from the abbey to Buckingham Palace after the ceremony. Royal wedding: The dress . A million people lined the wedding route, police said. The couple appeared before about half a million cheering supporters on a balcony of the palace and exchanged a quick kiss on the lips -- then pecked each other's lips again a moment later. Royal Air Force jets then flew over the crowd and the palace in formation, the official climax of the wedding celebration. Royal wedding: Hats galore . The prince and duchess went inside to a lunchtime reception for 650 people, hosted by Queen Elizabeth II. It featured an eight-tier wedding cake, the palace announced. They left about two hours later in an open-topped dark blue Aston Martin DB6 with a license plate reading ""Just Wed,"" William at the wheel. The car is one Prince Charles has owned since 1969 and had converted in 2008 to run on biofuel made from English wine wastage, his office announced. A search and rescue helicoper flew past as the newlyweds left the palace. The couple will be known as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge following their marriage, the royal family announced shortly before the wedding -- thus avoiding giving the newest member of the royal family any title that would implicitly compare her to Diana, Princess of Wales. The most devoted monarchists arrived days before the event and camped out with Union Jacks on their clothes, tents and faces. Some traveled from as far away as Colombia. Up to half a million people who didn't get one of the 1,900 invitations to Westminster Abbey were expected to watch the event on giant screens at Hyde Park in central London. Kings, queens, priests and politicians began to arrive at the abbey shortly after 8 a.m., with celebrities such as Sir Elton John and Olympic gold medallist Ian Thorpe among them. David Beckham arrived with his wife Victoria, with the soccer star sporting his OBE medal on the right lapel of his morning coat. Medals are traditionally worn on the left. Street parties are being held across the United Kingdom, while protests threatened by Muslim radicals, anarchists and anti-royalists largely failed to materialize. About 5,000 police officers are out on the streets, including 110 on horseback and 35 with sniffer dogs. London's Metropolitan Police reported 45 arrests by the time the reception began, mostly for breaches of the peace. The world's media have deployed even more resources than the police did, with at least 8,000 staff working in London for the event. British Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt predicted the ceremony would be seen by an estimated 2 billion people worldwide. But the British themselves are lukewarm about the event, with just under half saying they were planning to watch it on television, and 56% saying they were not interested. William announced his engagement to Middleton in November after proposing secretly in a rustic cabin in Kenya in October. He's the older son of Prince Charles and the late Diana, Princess of Wales; a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II; a military search-and-rescue helicopter pilot and, by one recent measure, the most popular member of the royal family. Middleton is an art history graduate and the eldest child of self-made millionaires who run a party-supplies company. Widely known as Kate before her wedding, the bride has now asked that she be called Catherine, the royal family said in the run-up to the wedding. They met as college students at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, sharing an apartment with a circle of friends before they began dating. She first caught his eye when she modelled in a student fashion show wearing a see-through dress over her underwear, British reports have said. The couple married at Westminster Abbey, where British monarchs are crowned, sometimes married, and often buried, alongside major figures from British history including Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Isaac Newton and George Frederic Handel. The guests included ""Mr. Bean"" actor Rowan Atkinson, a personal friend of Prince Charles; and former British Prime Minister John Major. But the guest list is as notable for who wasn't on it as who was. Former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were not invited, leading to accusations that the royal family favors the Conservative party over Labour. Buckingham Palace responded that Major was invited not because he was a Tory but because he was appointed guardian of Prince William and his younger brother Prince Harry when their mother Diana died in a car crash in 1997. Margaret Thatcher, a Conservative and the other living former prime minister, declined the invitation. She failed to appear at a Downing Street event in her honor last year because of ill health. U.S. President Barack Obama also wasn't invited, raising some eyebrows. The royal family explained that as a matter of protocol, presidents were not invited. The U.S. ambassador to London was on the guest list, as were most members of London's diplomatic corps. But Syria's ambassador was uninvited just a day before the wedding in light of his government's current crackdown on protesters. The Crown Prince of Bahrain, whose country is also clamping down on demonstrations, was invited but on Sunday decided not to attend. The controversies and the couple aside, the wedding was a very traditional British event in some respects. It included the Lord's Prayer, hymns and Bible readings typical of English nuptials, and the always nervous moment when the priest asks that if anyone present knows of a lawful impediment to the marriage, he speak now or ""hereafter forever hold his peace."" Of course, the priest asking that question Friday was Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the titular head of the worldwide Anglican church. And while it's not unheard of for British weddings to include a singing of ""God Save the Queen,"" this one was unusual in that the monarch in question was actually standing in the front row for it. William gave Middleton a ring of Welsh gold, but she didn't return the favour -- and she did not, in her vows, promise to obey him. Of course, if William does some day become king, Middleton will then presumably have to obey him. A ComRes poll for CNN when the engagement was announced in November found that just over half of British adults thought William would make a better king than his father Prince Charles, heir to the throne; 58% said Middleton would make a better queen than Charles's second wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. But the online poll's 2,015 respondents were split on the largely theoretical question of whether the crown should actually skip a generation and pass directly to William when his grandmother Queen Elizabeth dies. Forty-five percent said it should, while 41% said it should not. CNN's Carol Jordan and Stephanie Halasz contributed to this report.","NEW: The royal newlyweds leave Buckingham Palace in an open-topped Aston Martin .

"(Rolling Stone) -- After back-to-back stomach clutching renditions of ""Not Gon' Cry"" and ""I'm Going Down"" at the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans Sunday night, Mary J. Blige pulled off an Oprah-worthy seminar on affirmation with ""Just Fine"" to close out the three-day fest, which celebrates black music and African-American culture. The synth-heavy number pierced to the core of the capacity Louisiana Superdome crowd. As Blige danced around in a shimmering black mini-dress, the audience took over the number and launched into a sing-along that reached up to the fifth level of the arena. Earlier, Blige told Rolling Stone, ""I don't think fans come here to hear you talk about your new album. They come to hold their stomachs when you sing that song that you love so much. That's what [the festival] is about. To get that nostalgia. You gotta give the people what they want."" She certainly obliged. Photos: 2011 Essence Music Festival: Kanye West, Usher, Mary J. Blige, George Clinton and More . If Blige's set was packaged as faith and forgiveness, then Saturday night's headliner, Kanye West, was essentially id decked out in a sporty white blazer. The Chicago MC arrived through the air via a cable-enabled lift before he got off and had a Rudyard Kipling-inspired moment and walked through the crowd to reach the stage for ""Power."" Riffing off recent performances, West's show was a mix of his Coachella set (in three acts) and his VMA performance (red suit) but with a nod to the Essence crowd, as he finished with a stirring musical testimony to his mother, ""Hey Mama."" Photos: The Hottest Live Performances from Coachella 2011 . ""It feels so good to be back home,"" 'Ye told the audience -- not unlike Blige, preaching the power of healing. ""When I say home, I mean my people. I travel the world. I been around the world. I got into a little trouble. A little controversy here and there. But before I go any further in the show, I wanna thank you for coming out and still supporting me."" Friday night headliner Usher and Charlie Wilson (Friday's penultimate performer) had an unofficial generational game of one-upmanship. Wilson commandeered the stage for what felt like an eternity, though in actuality it was much closer to two hours, still, surely more than his allotment. The former Gap Band singer ran through a series of his old cohort's hits, from ""Outstanding"" to ""You Dropped a Bomb on Me."" Uncle Charlie, as he's been dubbed by Snoop Dogg, cut into Usher's constituency when he launched into ""There Goes My Baby."" The song not only shares the title with one of Usher's tracks, but the swooping song is best known (at least to the younger set) as Wilson's dedication to Snoop and his wife when the couple renewed their vows. Wilson smiled, preened and pranced as the audience swayed from side to side. A rejuvenated Usher, however, proved it's still a younger man's game. He also arrived from the sky like West, but once he landed (equipped with a helmet), the pre-July 4th fireworks started. ""U Don't Have to Call"" and ""You Make Me Wanna"" thundered throughout the dome. Shrieks echoed as leather-clad Ush slithered between dancers during ""Lil Freak"" and ""Trading Places."" But, much like Blige noted, the crowd wanted nostalgia and Usher offered it in heaps with a three-song Michael Jackson medley. It was a true ""OMG"" moment.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods said he had been inspired by Nelson Mandela as he paid his own tribute to the former South African president. Woods met Mandela for the first time back in 1998 after winning the U.S. Masters, the first of his 14 major titles, and admitted it had been a life changing experience. ""It's sad for everyone who got a chance to not only meet him, but I've been influenced by him,"" Woods said. ""I got a chance to meet him with my father (Earl) back in '98. ""He invited us to his home for lunch, and it was one of the most inspiring times I've ever had in my life. "" The world No.1 reacted to news of Mandela's death after completing his first round at the World Golf Challenge in California on Thursday. Woods, who went on to meet Mandela on several occasions, praised his courage in the face of adversity -- imprisoned by the South African regime for 28 years until released in 1990. ""I don't think any of us probably could have survived that and come out as humble and dignified as he did, and to lead an entire nation and to basically love the world when he came out,"" he told his official website. ""I think that's a testament to his will and his spirit and who he was. When he came out (of prison), the country could have fallen apart. It could have gone a lot of different ways, and he led it to where it's at now, and the world is going to miss him,"" he added. South African legend Gary Player, who hosted the Nelson Mandela Invitational tournament from 2000 to 2006, also mourned his loss. ""Condolences to all on the passing of our beloved Father of the South African Nation, Nelson Mandela,"" Player tweeted. ""Nelson Mandela's courage, forgiveness, love & hope inspired people around the world. He made me want to be a better man. Madiba we loved you. Rest in Peace."" Former world No.1 Greg Norman also reacted to the sad news on social media. ""My thoughts & prayers go out to Pres Nelson Mandela's family on his passing today. One of the greatest humans I ever had privilege to meet."" England's Ian Poulter added: ""Just heard that Nelson Mandela has passed away. Really sad news. Madiba May you rest in peace. What an inspirational man."" Poulter, like Woods, is in the 18-strong field for the PGA sanctioned tournament at Sherwood Oaks. He struggled to a four-over 76 to trail leader Zach Johnson by nine shots. Woods shot a 71, with defending champion Graeme McDowell on 72, one shot better than Rory McIlroy, who claimed last week's Australian Open title.","Tiger Woods pays tribute to Nelson Mandela .

"(CNN) -- Salmonellosis is a nasty illness. People infected with Salmonella develop diarrhea, a fever and abdominal cramps that usually last for four to seven days. The dangerous bacteria is found in the food we eat, usually chicken, beef or eggs that have been contaminated with animal feces. And a new report from Pew Charitable Trusts says the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) isn't doing enough to keep our food Salmonella-free. ""When more than 500 people get sick from two outbreaks associated with chicken that meets federal safety standards, it is clear that those standards are not effectively protecting public health,"" Sandra Eskin, director of Pew's food safety project, said in a statement. Every year, approximately 42,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but the actual number of infections may be much higher. The majority of outbreaks over the last two decades have been linked to live poultry. Pew researchers specifically looked at two recent outbreaks that were connected to chicken produced by Foster Farms in California. Between June 2012 and May 2013, 134 people became infected with Salmonella Heidelberg -- mostly in Oregon and Washington, according to the CDC. Tests identified the outbreak strain in four samples of chicken that were traced back to two Foster Farms slaughterhouses. Then in the summer and fall of 2013, 389 people in 23 states and Puerto Rico became sickened with varying strains of Salmonella Heidelberg. CDC investigators determined consumption of Foster Farms chicken was the likely source of the outbreak. ""In neither instance did FSIS ask Foster Farms to institute a recall or stop shipping potentially contaminated chicken to market,"" the Pew report authors wrote. No deaths were reported in either outbreak. The second outbreak is ongoing, according to the CDC, which updated its numbers Thursday. An additional 27 people have fallen ill since November. The FSIS acted as aggressively as possible under the authority they had during the Foster Farms outbreaks, said Brian Ronholm, USDA's deputy undersecretary for food safety. He said the USDA ""appreciates"" Pew's report since it ""supports the efforts we already have under way."" The government agency has a proposal under department review now that would require all poultry slaughterhouses to prevent contamination by conducting microbial testing at two points, Ronholm said. It would also authorize inspectors to suspend operations in slaughter facilities that cannot demonstrate they are controlling salmonella. In a separate paper, Consumer Reports said it found ""worrisome"" levels of bacteria in tests conducted on 316 chicken breasts, including 64 from brands that use no antibiotics in raising chickens and 24 organic samples. ""Every one of the four major brands we tested contained worrisome amounts of bacteria, even the chicken breasts labeled 'no antibiotics' or 'organic,' "" Consumer Reports said. The most common bacteria found was enterococcus, a fecal contaminant, in 79.8%. Next was E. coli, in 65.2%. Campylobacter, salmonella and staphylococcus aureus were also present, according to the report. In response to Consumer Reports, the National Chicken Council said poultry producers spend tens of millions of dollars each year researching food safety, which has helped significantly decrease food-borne pathogens. ""Americans eat about 160 million servings of chicken every single day,"" the council said in a statement, ""and 99.9% of those servings are consumed safely."" The USDA does not require poultry plants to treat the presence of salmonella as a significant risk, according to the Pew Report, and has no standards for chicken parts, which are purchased more widely than whole chickens. FSIS notifies facilities before conducting an investigation. Even if tests show unsafe amounts of salmonella, the authors wrote, FSIS cannot close down the facility. Salmonella is estimated to cause more than 1 million food-borne illnesses every year, according to the Pew Report, and health-related costs run as high as $11 billion yearly. The Pew report makes several recommendations for improving USDA's ""Salmonella Action Plan,"" which the agency posted earlier this month: . -- Change salmonella performance standards so they are updated regularly, enforceable and tied to public health outcomes. -- Consider establishing limits on the amount of salmonella that can be present in chickens as they enter slaughterhouses. -- Conduct unannounced testing in poultry producing facilities. -- Close plants that are under investigation and keep them closed until ""adequate control measures are in place."" ""The contaminated product isn't supposed to reach consumers -- that's the point,"" Eskin said. ""You see this is a very complicated bacteria. It's a challenge, and we haven't gotten it right yet."" Ronholm could not offer a time frame for when the FSIS food safety proposal may go into effect. He said it's important for consumers to remain diligent about food safety practices, including washing their hands and cooking food to the right temperatures.","Salmonella causes diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps for 4 to 7 days .

"DECATUR, Georgia (CNN) -- Fourth-grade teacher Elisabeth Beckwith wants her students at Fernbank Elementary School in Decatur, Georgia, to pay attention to a lesson on Greek mythology. Fourth-graders at Fernbank Elementary in Decatur, Georgia, practice the ""dromedary delight."" Instead of staring at the board in the front of the classroom, the kids are lying on the floor near their desks practicing yoga. ""It's fun,"" says 9-year old Jack Besser. ""It gets out the cramps after you've been sitting for an hour."" Besser's classmate Medha Prakash says the yoga drills help her to concentrate. ""It makes me feel calm, relaxed and it gets all the stress out of me."" Beckwith has linked the symbols of Greek gods to yoga poses, such as down dog and the stork. She's hoping the students will better retain the material and be re-energized in the middle of the day. ""It's a fun way for them to think about things,"" Beckwith says. ""You know, it's healthy for them because they're getting the breathing right and getting the stretching right."" Beckwith and other teachers at the suburban Atlanta public school started offering yoga in the classroom two years ago. They received instruction from YogaKids International, an Indiana-based company that distributes teaching materials to more than 50 schools around the country. A similar program is offered by California-based YogaEd.  Watch how yoga is working at one elementary school. » . At Fernbank Elementary, teachers hold up large flash cards with kid-friendly poses that are easy for the students to imitate. Step-by-step instructions are on the back for teachers to read out loud.

""If you say you're going to do yoga with the kids, they just immediately start focusing."" From kindergarten through fifth grade, students are learning to use deep breathing and basic yoga at their desks to cope with stress and anxiety that may occur before taking tests. School guidance counselor June Neal has seen a measurable difference among the students. ""We've seen an improvement in test scores and test-taking skills because their stress level is decreased after yoga."" Neal isn't worried about criticism that may be aimed at the school for taking time away from daily lessons to stretch and meditate. ""An elementary school is more than reading, writing and arithmetic,"" says Neal. ""You do need some down time, you do need some way to express yourself and to reduce anxiety that comes along with being in school."" Best-selling author Dr. Andrew Weil believes anxiety and stress are some of the biggest reasons young students get sick at the start of the fall semester.

Weil says stressed-out kids may complain of stomach pain or a headache instead of dealing with a stressful situation at school. He recommends training children to do simple deep-breathing techniques, just as adults do, to help with stress management. Beckwith's class might be just what the doctor ordered. After 30 minutes of coaching her students through different yoga poses, the kids seem calm but excited about what they've learned.

"Washington (CNN) -- Congress returns to Washington on Monday after a monthlong summer break to jump right into debate and votes on a resolution giving President Barack Obama the authorization to strike Syria. How this all will unfold over the coming week is far from certain, but here's how things could play out: . Monday . • The House and Senate are in session at 2 p.m. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is expected to take the first procedural steps to overcome an anticipated filibuster over whether to officially take up the Syria resolution. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who filibustered John Brennan's confirmation as CIA director earlier this year to protest Obama's drone policy, told Fox News on Sunday that he was weighing his options on how to stall the resolution. Rogers: Obama is losing support on Capitol Hill . • Obama will give a preview of his address to the nation when he does a round of interviews with major TV and cable outlets. CNN's Wolf Blitzer will report on his interview with the president on ""The Situation Room"" at 6 p.m. ET. Zelizer: Obama faces big hurdle convincing public on Syria . • All House members get an intelligence briefing from Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper at 5 p.m. ET. • Rice will also brief members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Tuesday . • Debate expected in the Senate. • Obama goes to Capitol Hill to meet with Senate Democrats on Syria. • Obama takes his case for a strike on Syria to the American people when he addresses the nation at 9 p.m. ET. Democratic Rep says Obama should withdraw request for authorization . Wednesday . • Should opponents filibuster whether to take up the Syria resolution, the first critical vote in the Senate could come today, requiring 60 votes to break the filibuster and move on to debate. If opponents lose the vote, they could still demand an additional 30 hours of debate on whether to take up the resolution. • Kerry, Hagel and other administration officials will brief all members of the Senate. McDonough: This is not Iraq or Afghanistan . After that? • What follows could be dictated by complicated parliamentary rules, the legislative strategy of supporters and opponents and other unforeseen variables that could influence the timeline of the debate. It's not clear how long the debate could last, but at some point Reid would move to end it if he thinks he has the necessary 60 votes. That could be the most significant vote of the week, because if it passes, it would send a strong signal that the resolution would ultimately succeed because final passage requires only a 51-vote simple majority. And in the House? • Republican leaders who control the House have said they will act after the Senate but have been vague on a schedule. It's unclear whether the House would vote on the language in the Senate resolution or take up its own version. Majority Leader Eric Cantor signaled in a memo to rank-and-file Republicans on Friday that debate could slip beyond next week. ""Members should expect a robust debate and vote on an authorization of use of military force pertaining to Syria in the next two weeks,"" he wrote. Obama has steep hill to climb in the House . But House GOP leaders are leaving open the possibility the House won't bring up the resolution if it fails in the Senate. House Speaker John Boehner's spokesman signaled that the burden for getting enough votes in the House is on Obama. ""Only a president can convince the public that military action is required. We only hope this isn't coming too late to make the difference,"" Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said in a statement.","Senate Majority Leader Reid expected to take steps to avoid anticipated filibuster .

"(CNN) -- The future of Fernando Alonso at Ferrari has been thrown further into confusion after the Spaniard was publicly rebuked by the Italian team's president Luca di Montezemolo on Monday. The two-time world champion probably did not expect to receive such an unwanted gift as he celebrated his 32nd birthday. Rumours linking Alonso with the possibility of a move to Red Bull, given the departure of Mark Webber at the end of season, had swirled around the Formula 1 paddock in Hungary this weekend. This followed news of a meeting between Alonso's manager Luis Garcia Abad and Red Bull team principal Christian Horner on Friday. The waters were further muddied on Sunday when Alonso, asked what present he would like for his birthday after dropping to third in the championship standings - courtesy of his fifth place at the Hungaroring, replied: ""someone else's car."" The Spaniard added that improvements were needed if the Ferrari was to win the world championship. It is unclear precisely which remarks prompted Ferrari to place a statement on their website explaining how the president ""tweaked"" Alonso's ear in a telephone conversation, after comments ""which did not go down well with Montezemolo, now with anyone in the team."" ""All the great champions who have driven for Ferrari have always been asked to put the interests of the team above their own,"" Ferrari's official website quoted Montezemolo as telling Alonso in a birthday call. ""This is the moment to stay calm, avoid polemics and show humility and determination in making one's own contribution, standing alongside the team and its people both at the track and outside it."" Since joining Ferrari in 2010, Alonso has failed to build on the world championships he won in 2005 and 2006 with Renault. He has twice come close to triumphing with Ferrari - only to be beaten by Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel by the narrowest of margins on both occasions. Alonso lost out by four points in 2010, while last season's championship saw the German win an even closer contest - pipping his rival by just three points to win his third straight title. Following comments made by Montezemolo last year, there would be considerable irony if Alonso were to end up as the stable mate of his major race rival. As media reports suggested that Vettel would move to Ferrari in 2014, the Ferrari supremo reacted by saying he did not want ""two roosters in the same hen house."" ""I don't want problems and rivalries,"" he added last October. Vettel added further intrigue to the situation on Sunday by declaring that he would prefer to be joined at Red Bull next season by Kimi Raikkonen, rather than Alonso, on the premise that the Finn has always been ""very straight"" with him. After ten races of the season, Alonso lies third in the standings - his 133 points one fewer than Lotus driver Raikkonen - while Vettel leads with a tally of 172. The Spaniard's contract with Ferrari is not due to expire until 2016. In a separate development on Monday, Ferrari confirmed that former Lotus technical director James Allison will join the team in September. Allison's departure from Lotus was revealed in May and he will assume the role of chassis technical director. ""At the same time, Pat Fry will take on the new position of Director of Engineering,"" Ferrari said in a statement. ""Both men will report directly to the Team Principal, Stefano Domenicali.""","Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo rebukes Fernando Alonso for recent comments .

"(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton believes his chances of ending Sebastian Vettel's grip on the world championship will be greatly improved when Formula 1's new rules come into force next season. Some of the most significant changes will involve the engines, with cars having to switch from their current 2.4-liter engines to a 1.6-liter turbocharged V6 engine. There will also be adjustments to both aerodynamics and energy systems, and Hamilton is relishing the potential consequences. ""I'm really excited about next year,"" the 2008 world champion told CNN World Sport. ""We have new rules, new engines and the cars are going to be a lot different. We're hoping it will make the playing field more level and that it gives us the chance to race. ""I just want to race and have a chance to fight for the championship."" In his first season with Mercedes, Hamilton lies fourth in the drivers' standings, trailing recently-crowned champion Vettel by 172 points with just two races of the season left. Yet the Briton has the chance to help his team finish second in the constructors' world championship, even if Mercedes still have plenty to do in both Austin and Interlagos with Ferrari and Lotus hot on their heels. The 334-point tally of Hamilton and teammate Nico Rosberg is just 11 more than Ferrari, while Lotus are also a threat with 297 points. Wherever Mercedes do finish, Hamilton will consider it a major improvement on last year when the team finished fifth in the constructors' standings, trailing fourth-placed Lotus by a wide margin. ""I really want to help this team finish second in the constructors' championship,"" explained a driver who left McLaren to sign a three-year deal with Mercedes in September 2012. ""We've had some tough races this season but we are growing race by race. We have achieved something just incredible this year, to go from where the team wasn't really so successful last year to becoming the ones that are competing with Ferrari and Red Bull.

"(CNN) -- Formula One drivers threatened to boycott the German GP this weekend if the tire problems which blighted the British round at Silverstone are repeated. The Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA) issued a statement after a meeting Thursday to ""express their deepest concerns"" over the events Sunday which saw five drivers, including race leader Lewis Hamilton, suffer high speed blow outs. Manufacturer Pirelli promised prompt action after the chaotic scenes and new tires will be used, which feature a Kevlar belt rather than the steel one previously used, apparently offering better protection from punctures. Teams have also been banned from tire swapping and have been told to adhere to limits on tire pressures. ""We trust that the changes made to the tires will have the desired results and that similar problems will not occur during the German GP weekend,"" said the GPDA. ""We are ready to drive our cars to the limit, as we always do, and as it is expected by our teams, sponsors and fans."" Aside from Hamilton, who battled back to fourth place behind victorious Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg, Felipe Massa, Jean-Eric Vergne, Sergio Perez and Esteban Gutierrez were also affected, with four of the drivers suffering the same left rear tire blow out. The stars of the grid said that if similar events manifested themselves at Nurburgring then they would not hesitate to pull out of the race. ""We shall immediately withdraw from the event, as this avoidable problem with the tires endangers again the lives of drivers, marshals and fans,"" ended the statement. Earlier, Ferrari ace Fernando Alonso, who narrowly avoided serious injury when debris from Perez's puncture nearly hit him at high speed, said he was keeping his fingers crossed that the problems will be eradicated by the new measures introduced by Pirelli. ""At the moment, we can't make any predictions, because no one has tried them and we don't know what and how many benefits they can bring, apart from trusting in the fact that it won't be dangerous to race, "" he told the official Ferrari website. ""Let's hope that means all drivers can race in safe conditions,"" he added. Alonso, second in the title race, will be hoping the triple defending champion Sebastian Vettel will extend his run of failing to win his home grand prix, despite his incredible success of recent seasons in the Red Bull. The 26-year-old German secured his first podium finish in F1 at the 2009 race but has not improved on that result. ""Surely, it is special,"" he said. ""In terms of championship points, it is the same as every other place, but it is something special to race in front of your home crowd,"" he told the official F1 website.

"(CNN) -- Ashley Bays took her toddler into M Spa Salon in Portage, Michigan, for a simple haircut but left with a ""severe tongue lashing,"" according to a witness whose Facebook post about the event went viral. Customer Vanessa Hunt wrote about her outrage at watching salon owner Michelle Mott allegedly dress down Bays and 2 Â½-year-old Grayson because the child cried during his haircut. ""At the conclusion of this woman's tantrum to the mother the mother said through tears, 'I'm so sorry, he's autistic,'"" Hunt wrote in a post that has been shared more than 35,000 times. Attorneys for the salon said in a statement to mlive.com that Mott reacted reasonably to safety concerns caused by the boy's behavior. Many toddlers cry during a visit to the hair salon, but the experience can be particularly challenging for individuals with the sensory sensitivities that are common in autism. I know, because my son is one of them. Haircuts require a patient stylist, a special list of instructions, books to read and a fresh shirt to change into immediately afterward. If it weren't for the promise of a lollipop at the end of the haircut, he might not go into the salon at all. The reality of finding a job with autism . The noise and feel of the clippers can be painful, the smells of dyes and permanents overpowering, the water sprayed on their hair upsetting and the sound of hair dryers panic-inducing. However, Bays, a longtime client of the salon, had found one hairstylist she trusted to cut her son's hair -- no small thing, as parents of children with autism can attest. The incident at M Spa Salon has brought a much larger issue to the public eye than merely the allegedly nasty behavior of one business owner: Parents of children on the autism spectrum struggle with public judgment on a daily basis. Sometimes kids with autism exhibit behaviors that draw attention to themselves, ranging from self-soothing repetitive motions to a full-blown meltdown in an overwhelming situation. The reaction of the bystanders can go a long way toward defusing panic or exacerbating it, which is what happened when Mott reportedly yelled at Ashley and Grayson Bays until they both left the salon in tears. ""I've never experienced anything else like this before. I understand if she doesn't want children in the salon, but she could have handled it a lot differently. She could have pulled us to the side. She was very insensitive that he does have special needs,"" Bays later said. Just as a negative reaction can make matters worse, thoughtful words and actions can help. The hairstylist who joined the family outside to complete the child's haircut stands out as an unsung hero in the unfortunate M Spa Salon drama. Another recent example was the kindness of a waitress at a Chili's Bar and Grill in Utah who replaced the ""broken"" hamburger of an autistic girl without batting an eyelash. Small kindnesses can go a long way. Work and autism: Your questions answered . So what should a person do if they witness a child with autism (or frankly any child) in distress? According to Amanda Benson, LCSW, an autism specialist at The University of North Carolina TEACCH Autism Program, the most useful thing that bystanders can do is ask the parents: ""Is there something I can do to make this easier for you?"" ""The parents will know what will best help their child,"" Benson said, such as dimming the lights, moving to a quieter space or offering a preferred toy as a distraction. In the specific case of a haircut, the child might be more comfortable with scissors only or conversely only with clippers. Because autism encompasses such a broad spectrum, there is no single solution that will work well for all individuals. Bystanders should refrain from judgment. Effective parenting techniques are different for children with autism than for typically developing kids. Because attention is often a strong behavioral reinforcement for individuals on the spectrum, parents may strategically ignore inappropriate behaviors, while providing positive reinforcement for appropriate behavior. Autism: What we know right now . Bystanders can help by offering an empathetic smile for the parent or a word of praise for a child who is trying his best. Some parents of autistic children carry small cards to hand out explaining autism to strangers who stop and stare, or sneer. Without acceptance of the whole spectrum of human development, people with disabilities are inevitably excluded from society. Given that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the autism prevalence in the United States to be 1 in 88 (and more recent studies suggest that figure may be as high as 1 in 50), business owners are going to have to become better educated about how to serve individuals with special needs. Not only are they their customers, as in the case of the young Grayson, but people with autism are entitled to the same access to public spaces afforded all other Americans.

""On behalf of all New Yorkers, I would like to express my sympathy to the loved ones of Assistant Attorney General Richard Schwartz, who tragically lost his life during last night's severe storm,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement Friday. The storms struck Thursday, and at one point that evening, severe thunderstorm watches were in effect for a continuous stretch from Oklahoma through New Jersey. In Pennsylvania, a tree crushed a woman in her car as she sought shelter at a campsite, killing her, said Glenn Dunn, the emergency management coordinator for Potter County. Tornadoes touched down in the Pennsylvania towns of Coudersport and Montrose on Thursday, forecasters said after conducting a survey of the area. The one in Coudersport was rated an EF-1 with a maximum wind speed of 90 mph, and the Montrose one was an EF-0 with maximum winds of 80 mph, the National Weather Service said. The service also reported that damage in Elmira, New York, was caused by an EF-1 tornado with estimated maximum wind speeds as high as 110 mph. In New York City, a 61-year-old man died Thursday when lightning struck a Brooklyn church, sending a scaffold crashing down on him, authorities said. Witnesses reported trees in the region buckling under the severe weather's impact. ""The trees were bending sideways, (and) the sky just went really dark and green,"" Mark Ventrini, a photographer, reported seeing as he headed toward Belmar, New Jersey. ""Some of the storms were pretty intense."" Emergency managers in Broome County, New York, reported people trapped inside a home because of downed trees in the town of Vestal.

"(CNN) -- Three-time world player of the year Lionel Messi outlined his and Barcelona's intention to win back the club's Spanish and European crowns after Sunday's season-opening 5-1 victory over Real Sociedad. The Argentine forward, who scored 50 league goals last season and 73 overall for the Catalan side, netted twice in the opening 15 minutes of Barca's first competitive match under new coach Tito Vilanova. It gave Barca an early edge in the title race as defending champions Real Madrid drew 1-1 with Valencia ahead of Thursday's first leg of the Spanish Super Cup -- which will be the first ""El Clasico"" clash of the 2012-13 campaign. Sunday's match also saw Spain striker David Villa make a goalscoring comeback from a broken leg which had sidelined him since December and caused him to miss his country's triumph at Euro 2012. ""We are a team that wants to keep on winning important titles for the club,"" Messi told BarcaTV. Who will be Europe's club champions? Under previous coach Pep Guardiola, Barca won three league titles and the European Champions League on two occasions but last season the Catalans' only success came in the Spanish Cup. ""I want to win it all, just like Tito,"" the 25-year-old Messi said. ""It will be difficult, but we'll try. It's important to start off winning."" Barca will face Jose Mourinho's Real at the Camp Nou on Thursday, with Messi and his teammates looking to win the Spanish season's annual curtain-raiser for the fourth year in a row. ""Despite having a new manager, the team continues to play with the same philosophy,"" said Messi. ""We're playing with the same style of play. ""It will be a complicated match because they are an experienced rival. The key to success is that all players actively participate so that we can score goals."" After the win over Sociedad, Barca's players spoke of their delight at seeing Spain's all-time leading goalscorer Villa return to action as a late substitute. ""Villa's return is the best piece of news of the game,"" said Spain forward Pedro, who scored Barca's fourth goal just before halftime. ""He scored a goal and it's an absolute joy to have him with us."" Barca captain Carles Puyol opened the scoring with an early header on his return to competitive action after missing Euro 2012 due to knee surgery. ""I'm really happy that we won and that El Guaje (Villa) scored!"" the veteran defender wrote on Twitter. Meanwhile, midfielder Alex Song arrived in Barcelona on Monday to complete his switch from English Premier League team Arsenal. The Cameroon star was set to undergo a medical ahead of move worth a reported $23.5 million. The 24-year-old becomes the second high-profile exit from the Emirates Stadium in the last week, following Robin van Persie's transfer to Manchester United. ""He's a footballer that gives us a bit of height. He'll surprise us with his skill, he's a great player,"" said Vilanova, who added that Song would provide backup for holding midfielder Sergio Busquets and would also be used as a central defender.","Lionel Messi wants Barcelona to regain dominance of Spanish and European football .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer is having his worst season on the tennis tour since he became a grand slam champion. He suffered his earliest grand slam exit in a decade and has slipped to seventh in the world rankings. For the first time since 2002, he didn't reach a grand slam final. His coach, Paul Annacone, appears to have paid the price for the slump as Federer announced Saturday that he had cut ties with the American who used to work with 14-time major winner Pete Sampras and ex British No. 1 Tim Henman. Annacone's ties to Sampras and Henman contributed to Federer hiring him in the first place, since the 17-time grand slam winner is friends with both former players. ""When we started together we had a vision of a 3 year plan to win another grand slam title and get back to the number #1 ranking,"" Federer wrote on his website. ""Along with many other goals and great memories, these 2 main goals were achieved. ""After numerous conversations culminating at the end of our most recent training block, we felt like this was the best time and path for both of us. ""Paul remains a dear friend, and we both look forward to continuing our friendship. I want to thank Paul for his help and the value he has added to me and my team."" It's likely that Federer will continue to work with Swiss Davis Cup captain Severin Luethi, who often accompanies him to tournaments, as he tries to earn a spot at the year-end championships in London. Federer is by no means guaranteed a berth in the eight-man field and his chances weren't helped when he lost to Gael Monfils in the third round of this week's Shanghai Masters. Afterwards, Monfils said Federer's aura was fading. ""I think he (misses) a little bit more than he used to,'' he said. ''I know he will try and go for his shot, but maybe he is a bit less confident.'' Federer said on the eve of the tournament he was looking forward to a ""great"" 2014 and his decision to split with Annacone suggests he is indeed determined to win another major rather than simply linger in the top 10.

"Washington (CNN) -- When the government investigates the alleged unauthorized release of sensitive information, the focus is normally on the person doing the leaking. But the criminal case against a State Department contractor escalated dramatically, putting the spotlight on the person reportedly receiving those communications -- Fox News reporter James Rosen. The complex layer of once-secret search warrants for e-mails and phone records involving Rosen have raised constitutional concerns about press freedoms, balanced against national security. The investigation of that adviser, Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, and a separate probe involving clandestine searches of Associated Press records, has prompted President Barack Obama to order a review of the federal government's practices involving leaks of classified material. ""I am troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable,"" Obama said recently. He has directed Attorney General Eric Holder to review the government's guidelines on such matters. Holder will convene a panel of media organizations scheduled to begin on Thursday as part of his review. The details of the investigation . A look at the legal records in the Kim case reveals much about the evolving process of the investigation. Here is what is known about the ongoing case: . In November 2009, the Justice Department secretly asked a federal court to grant a search warrant for a personal email account through Yahoo, Inc. servers. Prosecutors suspected Kim, who joined the State Department in 2008, was giving information to Rosen, classified intelligence about North Korea. Along with private e-mails and phone records, Justice Department officials tracked the reporter's movements in the State Department using his ID badge. Kim, 45, was born in Seoul South Korea and moved to the U.S. when he was a boy. His family settled in the Bronxdale section of New York. He has a PhD from Yale in diplomatic and military history. One of his areas of specialty at the State Department was North Korea's nuclear program. Recently unsealed documents show the government had in 2009 amassed an impressive amount of evidence against Kim, a contractor who no longer works at the State Department. Holder runs into roadblocks on off-the-record meetings on leaks . At the time, an FBI agent making the search warrant request, said, ""I conclude from the foregoing that Mr. Kim and Reporter A have communicated as recently as August 15, 2009 by email through both the [redacted]@yahoo.com accounts as well as what appears to be a clandestine e-mail account set up by Reporter A, [redacted]@gmail.com, to communicate with Mr. Kim and perhaps other sources of information."" And what of reporter Rosen? As of late 2009, the government apparently had no interest going after him. ""The FBI is not at this time seeking a search warrant for [redacted]@gmail.com. Rather it is restricting its request for email search warrants associated with Mr. Kim."" The Gmail account is apparently Rosen's although he is not mentioned by name in any of the documents. Six months later, things take a dramatic turn. Another search warrant application is filed in Washington, this time for a personal Gmail account controlled by Google, Inc. It is clear from the records it is Rosen's account and that he was at that time, in the government's eyes, possibly involved in a crime as ""aider or abettor and/or co-conspirator."" The warrant application was filed without the prior knowledge of Fox News. The government acknowledged it was an unusual situation, but felt it had no choice. ""The FBI has exhausted all reasonable non-media alternatives for collecting the evidence it seeks,"" said the May 2010 affidavit about Rosen's communications. ""Because of the reporter's own potential criminal liability in this matter, we believe requesting the voluntary production of materials from reporter would be futile and would pose substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation and of the evidence we seek to obtain by the warrant."" Holder to meet with news execs . An attempt to seal the records . The Obama administration had fought for more than two years to keep the Kim and Rosen search warrant affidavits sealed. In an unusual twist federal Judge Royce Lamberth last November ordered the records publicly released, but court clerks had for some reason failed to enter the documents in the court's online docket until last week. The publicly available court records do not clearly indicate why the government felt it needed to expand its already strong evidence against Kim into a probe of Rosen's actions. The reporter has not been charged with any crime, and while he was listed as a ""co-conspirator,"" that often does not mean he would be considered a target. Fox News officials have subsequently offered differing versions about when and if they were notified by the Justice Department after the fact about the searches. A law enforcement official insisted Tuesday the government notified Fox's parent company News Corp. it was issuing a request for two days of phone records in 2009. Justice Department policy requires those types of notifications to be delivered via certified mail, fax, and e-mail. The official said on August 27, 2010, two separate notifications were sent to Lawrence Jacobs, then the general counsel for News Corp. An e-mail also was sent to Rosen on the same day notifying him of the subpoena, the official said. The official request, according to this official, was for toll records -- lists of what numbers were dialed from five phone lines associated with Rosen -- and also the phone numbers of the calls received. The records would not reveal any content from conversations. But Jacobs, speaking to CNN Tuesday, said he doesn't remember receiving any notification from the Justice Department about a subpoena. ""I have no recollection of receiving anything from the Department of Justice,"" Jacobs said. ""It's the kind of thing I would remember."" Search warrants and subpoenas can be different. Subpoenas in this legal context are orders to a particular party to produce certain records or information. Search warrants are court orders allowing law enforcement to gather information or collect evidence, often without the prior knowledge of the person being investigated. Attorney General sign-off . Justice Department policy requires the attorney general to personally sign off on any search warrants involving the media. A Justice official tells CNN Holder in fact did just that. The actual warrant was approved by a federal magistrate. Many legal scholars say the only justification for such a search warrant involving the press -- and the high-level approval necessary from Holder -- would be if prosecutors firmly believe that reporter is criminally involved in an illegal leak of information, and are prepared to take legal action. The government suggested as much when it requested Rosen's private phone and e-mail records. But in the three years since, no indictment has come against Rosen. Administration officials have yet to explain -- either in court records or in a press conference -- whether Rosen was a serious target of prosecution, or whether Kim was the only person they were planning to prosecute and needed to make the claim about the Fox reporter in order to get emails to help the Kim prosecution. The affidavit involving the Rosen records says one of the main reasons for the search warrant was Kim had allegedly erased some e-mails that investigators were not able to recover. The FBI believed those missing e-mails could be found in Rosen's accounts. For example, the government was curious about how Kim (reportedly using the alias ""Leo"") responded to Rosen's alleged May 22, 2009, e-mail: ""Thanks Leo. What I am interested in, as you might expect, is breaking news ahead of my competitors."" DOJ says e-mails, letter prove it notified Fox of subpoenas . Holder under fire . Holder faces questions from Republicans on Capitol Hill, who are looking into whether he lied under oath earlier this month when he said he was not involved in the ""potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material."" ""That is not something I've ever been involved in, heard of, would think would be wise policy,"" Holder said at the May 15 hearing. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday that no prosecution ever took place in the Fox case, and therefore it was ""self-evident"" that any charge Holder lied to the House panel was ""inaccurate."" The attorney general said Tuesday he is ""not satisfied"" with some of the guidelines on how prosecutors conduct leak investigations involving reporters. ""We're going to have a real frank, good conversation about this,"" Holder told reporters following a naturalization ceremony for new U.S. citizens. ""And I think, we're going to make some changes because I'm not satisfied with where we are."" Focus on State Dept. contractor . While much of the political debate centers around Rosen and search warrants for members of the press -- from a legal perspective, the criminal case is clearly focused on Kim. In the search warrant affidavit for Rosen, it is Kim's alleged acts that drive the legal narrative. The government alleges call records of Kim's desk phone at the State Department between May and July of 2009 show 36 calls were exchanged between the government contractor and the reporter, including seven on the date Rosen published a story about North Korea. Kim himself was interviewed by FBI agents three months later in September of 2009 where he denied leaking classified information. He allegedly told investigators, according to the redacted affidavit, ""I wouldn't pick up a phone and call [the reporter] or [the news organization that the reporter works for]."" Eleven months after that interview -- and three months after the Rosen search warrant was issued -- Kim was indicted for unauthorized disclosure of ""National Defense Information"" and for making false statements to investigators. His case has not gone to trial and he denies the charges. The case is USA v. Kim (10-cr-225). CNN's Joe Johns and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","Justice Department sought search warrants for electronic communication of Fox News reporter in connection with leak investigation .

"(CNN) -- In typically collected fashion, Formula One's triple world champion Sebastian Vettel is taking each race as it comes. The unflappable Red Bull driver could become only the third driver to win four consecutive championships at this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix -- following in the footsteps of legendary drivers Michael Schumacher and Juan Manuel Fangio. But like any great champion, the German is concentrating on the next grand prix. ""I'm not really focusing on the title, I'm trying to focus on the race,"" the 26-year-old, who is bidding for a fifth consecutive grand prix win at the Suzuka Circuit, told CNN in Yokohama. ""We have a fantastic car, we are in great shape. We have to enjoy that and try our best."" In order for Vettel to be crowned champion this weekend he must take the checkered flag and hope Ferrari's Fernando Alonso -- his nearest rival -- finishes no higher than ninth. Vettel recently suggested the superiority he enjoys over two-time world champion Alonso could be the reason why he has been booed on the podium at a number of races during the 2013 season. His popularity among fans was also dented earlier this year, when he ignored team orders to pass teammate Mark Webber and win March's Malaysian Grand Prix. While he admits that the booing is disappointing, Vettel attributes it to sporting rivalry rather than a particular dislike for him or his all-conquering Red Bull team. ""It's not nice for sure,"" he said. ""But it's sport, there is no deep meaning behind it. People don't think. Somebody starts, some people join, others don't. It's not a big deal."" Vettel will get a lift this weekend when he takes to the track at Suzuka, one of his favorite circuits on the F1 calendar.

"(CNN) -- MotoGP's shining star Marc Marquez has been rapped over the knuckles and ""told to take more care"" when riding his bike by the sport's organisers. Running away with the MotoGP World Championship in his debut season, the 20-year-old Spaniard has been handed a penalty point and his Repsol Honda Team docked their points scored for Marquez's Aragon Grand Prix victory following his collision with teammate Dani Pedrosa. The pair had been scrapping for second place in the race two weekends ago when Marquez made contact with Pedrosa after misjudging the braking point at Turn 12. It broke a sensor cable on his fellow Spaniard's rear wheel and eventually led to Pedrosa crashing out of the race. The latest punishment takes Marquez to three penalty points this season as part of a points system that was introduced at the end of last year. Should the Spaniard pick up another penalty, he will have to start the next grand prix from the back of the grid. The penalty was dished out following a half-hour meeting with race direction, both riders and team management at the Sepang International Circuit, which will host Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix. ""We are sending a message to Marc, very clearly,"" said race director Mike Webb. ""We understand that he is an extremely talented rider but he is also intelligent enough to understand there has to be some margin for error -- especially, as we have seen a number of times this year, under braking when the rider behind has the responsibility of not getting too close to the rider in front who is riding his own lines. ""For us, that is a signal (even though the contact itself was quite minor) to make a formal warning by way of a penalty point to Marc to say he has to take more care."" Repsol Honda Team boss Livio Suppo admitted the team penalty was down to what was considered a safety lapse -- the failure of their traction-control system and the back-up unit, which, along with contact with Marquez, caused the Pedrosa crash. ""We need to think about it and see whether we have to make an appeal or not,"" said Suppo. As for the Marquez penalty, Suppo added: ""Marc has been penalized with one point on his license. ""That means there is no consequence for this race. Basically, they said that in this case it was more or less OK but they are taking Marc's whole season into consideration and he has been close to touching the rider in front of him on more than one occasion. ""The message was basically, 'this time it was OK but realize that you have been doing this quite often'.""","Marquez handed penalty after collision with Pedrosa at Aragon Grand Prix .

The World No.1 dug deep from a set down and three all in the second against China's Li Na to reel off nine straight games to clinch the prestigious title, 2-6 6-3 6-0. ""I can't believe I won. I was so tired. Honestly, did I really win? Because she played so well,"" Williams said in her post match interview. ""I'm just overjoyed, to be honest,"" Williams added. ""It's really awesome. It's such a special moment. To finish the year No.1 in the world and win this title after 40 years of the WTA, it means even more."" Williams had to grind out a three set semifinal win over Jelena Jankovic Saturday and fell a set down to her fourth seeded Chinese opponent in the final as the tiredness set in. Williams pulled 3-0 ahead in the second set, only for Li to win three straight games to level. A lesser player might have crumbled, but the 17-time grand slam champion took her game to another level and finished it off with her 30th winner of the match. Victory took her prize money for the season to a record $12,385, 572 and at 32 years and one month she is the oldest winner at the end of season championship. It was her 78th WTA career title and she shows no sign of letting up in her pursuit of records with the first grand slam of the 2014 season in Australia next January firmly in her sights . Li has also finished the season strongly, the first Chinese player to make the WTA Championships final. She is set to move to her hightest ranking of World No.3 in the new list and showed enough in the opening set and a half to give her hope of further grand slam success to add to her 2011 French Open triumph.","Serena Williams wins 2013 WTA Championships .

"(CNN) -- In a country obsessed with its premier sport, Egypt's football season kicks off Saturday to heavy anticipation -- but without any fans in the stands. Instead of the roars of raucous crowds, players take the pitch to the relative silence of secure military stadiums. Saturday's matches are the first since a gruesome riot at a football match last year that left 74 dead and 1,000 injured. Dubbed the ""massacre at Port Said,"" the riot in February 2012 broke out after Port Said-based Al-Masry defeated Cairo's Al-Ahly, 3-1. Fans from both sides bashed one another with rocks and chairs, and many of those who died fell from the bleachers while others suffocated. While the football rivalries between the cities have been a mainstay, recent political upheaval has only fueled the fire. Last week, a judge issued death sentences for 21 Port Said residents for their roles in the riot. Those verdicts incensed Port Said residents who blame security officials -- not fans -- for the mass tragedy. Fear and loathing in Egypt: The fallout from Port Said . Decades of strife . The history of tense relations between Port Said and Cairo date about 60 years, as residents of Port Said have felt betrayed by Egyptian security forces during a series of wars with Israel. Thousands of residents were displaced several times because of the Suez War, the Six-Day War of 1967, the War of Attrition with Israel, and the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. Residents of Port Said, in the northeastern corner of the country, believed security forces did not adequately defend their city. In addition, some say Cairo has not invested enough in Port Said's infrastructure, and that their city doesn't reap enough tax benefits from trade with international ships that pass though Port Said via the critical Suez Canal. Some also contend that Port Said is still getting the cold shoulder from Cairo after a 1999 assassination attempt of then-President Hosni Mubarak, who was visiting the city. Could Egypt fall apart? Molotov cocktails and fire at the presidential palace . The new football season also kicks off amid new turmoil embroiling the country. The latest spate of violence started during demonstrations last week to mark the two-year anniversary of the Egyptian revolution. Protesters angry with the slow pace of change and with President Mohamed Morsy's actions clashed with Morsy supporters and police in the cities such as Suez and Ismailia. Those clashes, combined with furor over Port Said death sentences, led to scores of deaths. The chaos snowballed through Friday, when a fire broke out at the entrance of the presidential palace as protesters hurled Molotov cocktails and rocks at security forces. Authorities responded with tear gas and water cannon, and Egyptian TV aired live footage of security forces beating a naked man on the ground. A presidential spokesman on Saturday deplored the video of the man being beaten, calling it ""shocking."" The government assures ""that what happened was an individual behaviot and does not represent the ideology of the police force,"" spokesman Yasser Ali said. He promised an investigation into the incident. The protests are the latest in the seesaw struggle between Egypt's first democratically elected president and dissidents who say his leadership is a throwback to past dictatorships, particularly the reign of Mubarak, who was toppled two years ago in the popular revolt. Protesters attack presidential palace in Cairo . More than just a game . In Egypt, football isn't just a sport. It's an escape from the economic, political and social tumult wracking the country. The only times traffic virtually disappears from Cairo streets are when residents break their daily fasts during Ramadan and when the city's two main teams -- Al-Ahly and Zamalek -- take the field. Saturday's matches feature both those Cairo teams -- Al-Alhy against Ghazl El-Mehalla and Zamalek against Al-Ittihad Al-Sakndary. But while football has both unified and polarized parts of the country, fans now must cheer or lament from afar. CNN's Ben Wedeman, Reza Sayah and Amir Ahmed contributed to this report.","NEW: Presidential spokesman promises investigation of police who beat protester .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel has dominated Formula One for the past three years and looks set to win a fourth straight drivers' championship -- but that could all change in 2014 when the winds of change are unleashed on the sport. Vettel's Red Bull has been the standout car, with the German consistently faster than his rivals at Ferrari, Mercedes, Lotus and McLaren. However, McLaren's sporting director Sam Michael says the introduction of new technical regulations next season means a new order may emerge in the world of F1. Cars currently use 2.4-liter engines but they will be forced to bring in 1.6-liter turbocharged V6 engines next year, while there are also changes to aerodynamics and energy systems. ""When you get a big rule change the engineering structures are not fast enough to respond, even if you're given two or three years to design cars for 2014,"" Michael told F1's official website. ""Although we're a world away from where we were 20 years ago in terms of preparation -- ultimately until you get out there and run properly you're not going to have as much reliability as you do on the current cars. ""So do I think it will mix things up? Probably. There'll be different results that wouldn't occur like they do now. It's just another thing that's part of rule changes and it's something that you have to cope with."" Vettel has won seven races so far this season and sits well clear at the top of the drivers' championship, with nearest challenger Fernando Alonso of Ferrari 60 points adrift. But Michael believes next season could be a far closer affair. He says the introduction of a new powertrain will give teams early reliability problems, while narrow front wings, a reduction in nose height and prohibiting of exhaust blowing will also cause trouble for mechanics. ""When you have such a big change to the powertrain from a mechanical side, you will build in more margin than what you would have done previously,"" he added. ""Let's say we hadn't made any changes to the powertrain for next year; what you'd be doing is taking an extremely well-known product and chipping away at marginal gains -- a little bit of weight here, a bit of friction there, maybe a change in packaging. ""That's all gone out of the window for 2014 and you'll be in one of two positions -- either you've pushed it too far and you'll be unreliable, or you'll be too heavy and you'll want to take some weight out of the car. ""Both of those things take time. You won't have got it bang on in all areas of the car, so everyone will be in the same game. ""The slope that you get on when you have such big rule change is very steep compared to normal, so I think the development race -- trying to claw back as much downforce as you can -- will be a significant part of the 2014 season.""","Formula One will introduce a whole host of new regulations for 2014 season .

"(CNN) -- The simmering row between departing Kimi Raikkonen and his Lotus team came to a boil Friday as the Finn threatened to boycott the final two races of the F1 season because he has not been paid. Raikkonen turned up late for the Abu Dhabi round and took fourth behind all conquering Sebastian Vettel in afternoon practice. But addressing gathered reporters at the end of session, the former world champion gave vent to his frustrations. ""I came here only because hopefully we found an understanding on the certain issues we have been having,"" said Raikkonen told UK's Press Association. ""Hopefully it will be fixed and we can finish the season as well as we can."" But when pushed on the possibility of not taking part in the final races in the United States and Brazil, Raikkonen hinted at the possibility of a no show. ""I enjoy racing, I enjoy driving -- but a big part of it is business,"" he said. ""Sometimes when that is not dealt with like it should, we end up in an unfortunate situation. You have to put the line somewhere, and if it goes over that... it is not really my fault anymore."" Raikkonen is reported to be owed $20 million for his efforts in 2013, a situation which has arisen because of financial arrangement Lotus has with its majority owners, the Luxembourg based investment group Genii Capital. Under the arrangement, the drivers -- Raikkonen and Frenchman Romain Grosjean -- get their pay at the end of the season after sponsorship deals are tied up to cover the fees. Raikkonen's frustrations with Lotus have built up over the season and he was involved in an angry and very public altercation with pit wall boss Alan Permane at the Indian Grand Prix last Sunday. Team chairman Gerard Lopez has tried to cool the situation, praising Raikkonen for his efforts which leave them challenging for second place in the constructors' championship behind Red Bull. ""The only reason we're fighting for second in the world championship is because of all the points that Kimi has scored,"" he told the team's official website. ""We're doing everything we can to ensure Kimi and the team can continue to fight right up to the checkered flag in Brazil. ""Of course, recently a lot was made about the comments between Alan Permane and Kimi during the course of a tense moment in a race, but this was just one exchange taking a matter of seconds in the course of a two-year relationship,"" he added. Raikkonen told reporters that he regretted the incident, but said other factors had left him disgruntled. ""It is all the other stuff, and all the things come together in the end. Like I said, it is easy to say that is the reason but it is not that."" ""Sometimes it is not very nice when you hear that you are not really a team player, and you don't have the interests of the team (at heart) -- but you have been paid zero Euro the whole year,"" added the Finn. Meanwhile, Vettel, who wrapped up a fourth straight title in India, continued his domination with a one minute 41.335 second clocking at the Yas Marina Circuit, ahead of Red Bull teammate Mark Webber. Lewis Hamilton took third for Mercedes ahead of Raikkonen and Nico Rosberg in the second Mercedes.","Kimi Raikkonen hints at Lotus walkout .

"Denver (CNN) -- A small group of New Year's Eve revelers here ditched the traditional champagne toast, lighting up joints instead at a newly opened marijuana club. The members-only Club 64 is the first of its kind to open in Colorado since November when voters approved Amendment 64, which legalized possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use. The club opened on New Year's Eve at 4:20 p.m. -- another significant number among pro-pot advocates -- to a small, but enthusiastic crowd of about a dozen people, all over the age of 21. Each member paid a $29 fee, allowing them to bring their own weed and smoke anywhere on the premises. Not all of Colorado's marijuana advocates are celebrating. ""Much of our success with Amendment 64 was making the soccer moms comfortable,"" said one advocate who campaigned to pass the amendment and declined to be named for fear of creating a rift within the marijuana advocacy community. ""This is not the fight we want to have right now."" Marijuana advocates hope to rise from 'prohibition' Even though the club doesn't sell marijuana, the advocate said it ""thwart(s) the intent of Amendment 64,"" which requires a year-long waiting period before stores are allowed to open and sell marijuana. That provision is designed to allow state and local governments enough time to regulate the industry and, proponents hope, to help ease fears in the community. Despite new laws in Colorado and Washington state, federal law still prohibits recreational marijuana use. It's unclear if the federal government will step in and try to stop either state's laws from being enacted. The advocate expressed concern that unregulated marijuana clubs in Colorado could create a bad impression on voters who supported the measure. ""We have not only an opportunity but a responsibility to demonstrate to America this can work."" Opinion: President needs to fix broken drug policy . In a carefully worded statement, the advocacy director of Yes on Amendment 64 said that while Club 64 poses no risk to the community, it does put at risk the advances their cause has made. ""We can best demonstrate that regulation is a much safer approach to marijuana policy than prohibition through the careful and swift creation of regulated businesses,"" Betty Aldworth said. Those who showed up at Club 64 Tuesday weren't interested in making sure ""soccer moms"" would approve of their behavior. They just wanted to celebrate their recent victory at the ballot box by ringing in the new year with their now legal drug of choice. ""The voters of Colorado have said we want cannabis to be legalized and we want a bunch of like-minded adults to be able to get together and exercise their constitutional rights together and that's what Club 64 embodies,"" said club owner Rob Corry. Gabriel Kinderay, clad in an orange Denver Broncos cap, wasted no time filling a small glass pipe with marijuana he says he grew himself and lighting up. ""It seems like up until today we were the kind of people that had to be secretive about who we were and how we lived our lives,"" he said. ""Over the last couple of years we've been able to start really talking more openly about what we do and people have accepted it and that's great. I'm glad to see that."" Marijuana use holds steady among U.S. teens . Club 64 doesn't have a permanent location and the address for the New Year's Eve celebration was distributed only to paying members. Corry hopes to make the club a monthly event, moving from location to location. Long-time Denver marijuana activist Miguel Lopez hopes Amendment 64 and Club 64 will serve as a model for other communities. ""It's a pathway to further freedom,"" said Lopez. ""Are we truly free if all human beings cannot possess marijuana? Not just in Colorado but as a human rights campaign globally. Let Denver be a beacon of hope for freedom, for true freedom."" Lopez then fired up a joint, held in the smoke and exhaled with a series of coughs. ""You can't get off if you don't cough,"" he said with a grin. The new year could bring a deeper divide among Colorado's pro-marijuana advocates, as the state tries to figure out how to reconcile its new law with the federal government and the stigma surrounding the drug that advocates insist is no worse than alcohol. Corry, an attorney and a longtime marijuana advocate who is known for ruffling feathers, rejected the notion that his club is hampering efforts to make marijuana more socially and legally acceptable. ""This is much larger than just marijuana, this is a civil rights struggle to end prohibition and civil rights struggles and overcoming oppression (do) not happen easily,"" Corry said. ""It has to happen by people taking chances and sometimes yes, pushing the envelope ... ""And that is how change happens in this country and that's what got us to this point -- people taking chances and pushing the envelope.""","Colorado's first marijuana club opened on New Year's Eve in Denver .

"(CNN) -- Nigerian author Chinua Achebe, a literary icon whose 1958 novel ""Things Fall Apart"" captured the world's attention, has died, his publisher said. He was 82. An author of more than 20 books, he was celebrated worldwide for telling African stories to a captivated world audience. He was also accorded his country's highest award for intellectual achievement, the Nigerian National Merit Award. Achebe is a major part of African literature, and is popular all over the continent for his novels, especially ""Anthills of the Savannah,"" which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1987, and ""Things Fall Apart."" The latter was required reading in countless high schools and colleges in the continent, and has been translated into dozens of languages. Set in precolonial Nigeria, ""Things Fall Apart"" portrays the story of a farmer, Okonkwo, who struggles to preserve his customs despite pressure from British colonizers. The story resonated in post-independent Africa, and the character became a household name in the continent. Achebe's stories included proverbs and tackled complex issues of African identity, nationalism and decolonization, adding to his books' popularity. A critic of Conrad, poor governance . Achebe once wrote an essay criticizing Joseph Conrad, author of ""Heart of Darkness,"" as a racist for his depiction of Africans as savages. Conrad's popularity took a hit after the accusation -- a testament to Achebe's credibility. He also criticized corruption and poor governance in Africa, and had been known to reject awards by the Nigerian government to protest political problems. In a tweet, his publisher Penguin Books described him as a "" brilliant writer and a giant of African literature. Nelson Mandela said he 'brought Africa to the rest of the world'."" Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan paid tribute to Achebe, hailing him as a cultural icon, a nationalist and an artist. Achebe's ""frank, truthful and fearless interventions in national affairs will be greatly missed at home,"" Jonathan said. ""While others may have disagreed with his views, most Nigerians never doubted his immense patriotism and sincere commitment to the building of a greater, more united and prosperous nation."" South African President Jacob Zuma said he was saddened by the loss of a ""colossus of African writing"" who had helped many define themselves. ""It was in his famous novel ""Things Fall Apart"" that many Africans saw themselves in literature and arts at the time when most of the writing was about Africans but not by Africans,"" Zuma said. Biafran War . Born in Nigeria in 1930, Achebe was raised in the large village of Ogidi, one of the first centers of Anglican missionary work in eastern Nigeria. He was an early graduate of University of Ibadan, established in Nigeria before the end of British colonial rule in 1960. He worked in radio, but in 1966, left his post during the national upheaval that led to the bloody Biafran War, in which Nigeria's southeastern provinces attempted to secede. Achebe joined the Biafran ministry of information and represented Biafra on diplomatic and fundraising missions before the civil war came to an end after two and a half years. His 2012 memoir, ""There Was a Country: A Personal History of Biafra,"" draws on his recollections of that painful period in Nigeria's past. A review by Adam Nossiter for the New York Times talks of how the book gives ""glimpses of this immense human tragedy in Achebe's characteristically plain-spoken narrative"" but is also ""tinged with odd nostalgia for the ephemeral moment when Biafra seemed to birth a national culture."" Fellow Nigerian writer Ben Okri, whose novel ""The Famished Road"" won the 1991 Booker Prize, first met Achebe in the 1980s, when they did a radio interview together. It was ""startling"" how kind he was, he said, and how ""generous toward a younger, somewhat angrier writer."" ""He was one of the most important writers to deal with the issue of the historical clash of civilizations, and the sometimes disastrous and sometimes benevolent consequences,"" Okri said. ""He was without any doubt a very important figure, not only as a writer but as a guiding presence. He combined humility with forcefulness. He wrote clearly and truthfully, and was a touchstone for many African writers and many writers around the world."" 'Generosity of spirit' In the course of a long academic career, Achebe took up university posts in Nigeria and overseas, including teaching at Brown University in Rhode Island, where he was professor of Africana Studies, and Bard College in New York. Leon Botstein, president of Bard College, described him as ""a brilliant novelist, storyteller, and eloquent voice from the opposite side of Joseph Conrad, with respect to the relationship of the West to Africa."" He also highlighted Achebe's ""extraordinary generosity of time and spirit"" during more than 20 years as a member of the Bard College community, adding that he will be deeply missed. ""For many, he was considered the father of African literature, and for many of his students, he introduced them to an extraordinary literary tradition,"" Botstein said. ""His importance to literature, and to those he taught and knew personally, will never be forgotten."" Corey D. B. Walker, an associate professor and chair of the department of Africana Studies at Brown University, said Achebe's loss was a great one. ""He was more than just a colleague, faculty member, and teacher at Brown. He was a gift to the world,"" he said. ""At a time like this we could draw many words of wisdom and comfort from the deep wells of various African cultures and traditions to honor him. The most fitting is the simple and elegant phrase, 'A great tree has fallen.' "" In an interview for the Paris Review of Books in 1994, Achebe spoke of how his early love of stories made him realize that they only reflected the point of view of the white man. That spurred him to write himself. ""There is that great proverb -- that until the lions have their own historians, the history of the hunt will always glorify the hunter. ... Once I realized that, I had to be a writer. I had to be that historian,"" he said. ""It's not one man's job. It's not one person's job. But it is something we have to do, so that the story of the hunt will also reflect the agony, the travail -- the bravery, even, of the lions."" People we lost in 2013: The lives they lived .

"(CNN) -- In his first New Year's address, the young North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told the nation to embark on ""an all-out struggle"" to overhaul its destitute economy, while striking a conciliatory tone on relations with the South. Broadcast on state media, the speech Tuesday was a break from the approach of Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, who died more than a year ago and never made televised addresses during his 17 years in power. Although Kim Jong Un has cultivated a much less austere public image than his father, he has still maintained the strong emphasis on advancing the reclusive state's military capabilities, and putting a renewed strain on ties with the United States and South Korea. In his speech, Kim celebrated North Korea's controversial launch last month of a long-range rocket that put a satellite in orbit. Condemned by the United Nations, the move was widely considered to be a test of ballistic missile technology. Koreas in 2013: Watch the generational politics . The launch was ""a great event which inspired all the service personnel and people with confidence in sure victory and courage and clearly showed that Korea does what it is determined to do,"" Kim said, according to a transcript of his speech published by the state-run Korean Central News Agency. He linked the launch of the rocket to his call to revamp the nation's poverty-stricken economy, which relies heavily on trade with its key ally, China. ""Let us bring about a radical turn in the building of an economic giant with the same spirit and mettle as were displayed in conquering space,"" Kim said, stressing the need to improve the standard of living of the country's malnourished population. He didn't however provide details on what kind of measures would be introduced to increase industrial and agricultural output. Turning to the tense relationship with South Korea, Kim said that removing ""confrontation"" between the two sides would be important in bringing about their reunification. He criticized the ""hostile policy"" of ""anti-reunification forces"" in the South. His comments come less than two weeks after the election of a new South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, who has promised to pursue greater engagement with Pyongyang than her predecessor did. But her task has been made more complicated by the North's provocative rocket launch last month. In a speech following her election victory, she said she intended to ""open up a new era for the Korean peninsula with strong security and credible diplomacy."" 2013: Asia's time? The two countries are technically still at war, since no peace accord was reached after the all-out armed conflict they fought in the 1950s. The leader of North Korea at the time of the Korea War was Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of Kim Jong Un. In making Tuesday's televised New Year's address, the younger Kim appears to have rekindled one of his grandfather's traditions. The last time a North Korean leader made such a speech was in 1994 -- Kim Il Sung's last New Year's address before his death. During Kim Jong Il's rule between 1994 and last year, the spoken address on January 1 was replaced by an editorial published by state-run newspapers. The editorial was mandatory study for all citizens, recollecting the achievements of the past year and laying out the tasks for the year ahead, themes apparent in Kim Jong Un's speech Tuesday.","Kim Jong Un wants a ""radical"" change in North Korea's economic development .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel led from start to finish to claim the Canadian Grand Prix Sunday to extend his title lead as he searches for a fourth straight Formula One world championship. The Red Bull star pulled clear from pole position and was never seriously challenged as he finished with a winning margin of over 14 seconds from second placed Fernando Alonso. Lewis Hamilton, who started on the front row with Vettel in his Mercedes, claimed the final podium spot, overtaken in the closing stages by the charging Alonso, who had started sixth on the grid in his Ferrari. But up front, Vettel was untouchable, claiming his first win at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal and his 29th career triumph. Interactive: Results and standings . It has left him 36 points clear of two-time champion Alonso in the title race. Kimi Raikkonen occupied third spot, a further eight points adrift. The Finn was way off the pace in his Lotus, but came home ninth to be in the points for a remarkable 24th straight race, equaling the record of seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher. Mark Webber battled a damaged front wing to claim fourth for Red Bull, who increased their lead in the constructors' race over Ferrari. Monaco winner Nico Rosberg finished fifth in the second Mercedes ahead of Jean-Eric Vergne in the Toro Rosso. Britain's Paul Di Resta, adopting a one-stop strategy in the Force India, finished seventh with Felipe Massa in eighth for Ferrari. Adrian Sutil claimed the final point for Force India. Vettel was delighted to break his win drought in Canada after coming so close on previous occasions. ""We had good races here before but it didn't come together to win, "" he said at the victory celebration. ""I lost it in the last lap two years ago which was my fault but I made up for that today."" Alonso, clearly the crowd favorite with the fans, who roared their appreciation as he overtook his old rival Hamilton for second, was pleased to limit his losses on Vettel. ""I think second tastes of victory, because we scored some good points after a very difficult weekend."" Hamilton, who is fourth in the title race, was also satisfied as Mercedes maintained their good start to the season. ""We just have to keep pushing so we can get closer to these guys."" His old team McLaren suffered another disappointing race, with Sergio Perez and Jenson Button in 11th and 12th. It was the first time McLaren has been out of the points in 64 races.

"(CNN) -- Organizers of the 2018 Russia World Cup insist they have nothing to hide ahead of an investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments. Football's world governing body FIFA awarded the 2018 competition to Russia and the 2022 World Cup to Qatar in December 2010, a decision which has been dogged by allegations of corruption and wrongdoing. Michael Garcia, a former New York attorney, is head of the investigative arm of FIFA's ethics committee and will visit all of the countries involved in the bidding process for the two tournaments, beginning in London next week. Garcia has always insisted he is completely independent from FIFA and would not hesitate to take action against president Sepp Blatter or other top FIFA officials if he found evidence that they broke the rules. The head of media for Russia 2018 says the committee will co-operate fully with Garcia's fact-finding investigation. ""We can confirm the local organizing committee (LOC) will fully support Mr Garcia's work if he contacts us,"" read a statement issued to CNN. ""The Russia 2018 committee ran a bid campaign in full compliance with FIFA rules and ethics, and we were awarded the right to host the FIFA World Cup because of the unique and compelling proposition we put together. ""The LOC continues to conduct itself with exactly the same degree of transparency, commitment to excellence and spirit of fair play."" Blog: Can the Qatar World Cup be moved? How and where Garcia's potential meeting with Russia takes place is open to question given in April he was one of 18 people barred from entering the country over what Moscow said were human rights abuses, linked to the lawyer's arrest and charging of Viktor Bout, a Russian, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence in the U.S. for arms trafficking. News of Garcia's investigation came ahead of FIFA's executive committee in Zurich on Thursday and Friday where it will discuss the possibility of moving the 2022 tournament from the usual June and July slot to December. ""I will conduct interviews in various places and I hope that those who have some information, even if they are not obliged to give me some, will agree to talk to me,"" Garcia told France Football magazine. ""My goal is to submit a report that covers the World Cup bidding and awarding process."" Mark Pieth, who will leave his post as chairman of the Independent Governance Committee at the end of the year, said Garcia's task isn't easy. ""He's in a very awkward situation,"" Pieth told CNN. ""He has no police powers. He can't just walk into an office in Dubai and say, 'I want these files and I want all your hard disks.' ""He has to use the techniques of an international investigator and so the big question is, even if there's evidence around, will he find it? We don't know. What I can do is make sure he gets the manpower and he gets the resources, the money, to run this."" FIFA's decision to award Qatar the 2022 tournament has been particularly criticized, with many suggesting the oppressive heat in the Gulf state makes staging the World Cup there impractical and dangerous. Pieth himself said he had ""serious doubts"" about the procedure used to give Qatar the event. Moving the competition from the northern hemisphere summer to winter could present a number of problems to the sport's major leagues and major broadcasters. ""Deals were signed for a summer World Cup,"" Fox Sports reporter Leander Schaerlaeckens told France Football. In 2011, Fox Sports agreed to pay a record $425 million for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments. The three rival bidders beaten by Qatar, the United States, Australia and South Korea and Japan, could file complaints with Swiss authorities regarding the bidding process.

"(CNN) -- Three-time Formula One world champion Sebastian Vettel has extended his deal with Red Bull through to the end of the 2015 season. The German is on course for a fourth straight drivers' championship title after victory at the Canadian Grand Prix on Sunday saw him extend his lead at the top of the standings to 36 points. Vettel has reigned supreme over the sport since landing his first title in 2010 and has now added an extra 12 months onto his current deal. The 25-year-old had been linked with rival marques such as Ferrari and Mercedes but has put an end to the speculation by signing a new contract. ""Infiniti Red Bull Racing is happy to confirm that World Champion Sebastian Vettel has extended his multi-year contract with the team until the end of 2015,"" a Red Bull statement read. ""A previous member of the Red Bull Junior squad, Sebastian first drove for Red Bull Racing in 2009. ""During his Formula One career, the 25-year-old has achieved 29 wins, 51 podiums and 39 pole positions. ""He is the current Formula One World Champion and also a triple World Champion, having retained the title since he first won it in 2010."" Vettel and Red Bull have dominated the elite division of motorsport since the landmark campaign in 2010 when Vettel won the drivers' title and his team the constructors' championship. The following year Vettel secured a record points total of 392, winning 11 of the 17 races that year. In 2012 Vettel won by a much closer margin -- just three points separated him and Ferrari's Spanish driver Fernando Alonso. Victory meant he became the youngest ever triple world champion at 25, and matched the hat-trick of titles achieved by Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher. Vettel has won three out of seven races this season and after leading from start to finish in Canada on Sunday he extended his lead over Alonso to 36 points.","Formula One world champion Sebastian Vettel extends his deal with Red Bull .

"(CNN) -- The Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, was passed into law more than three years ago, but it really doesn't go into effect until next year. That's when the major changes, including the health insurance exchanges ramp up and the Medicaid expansion occurs. Because there has been such a long time between when things started and now, there are plenty of misconceptions about what's happened, what's going on, and what will occur. For instance, just a month ago, a poll found that 4 in 10 Americans were unsure about whether Obamacare still existed. About a quarter didn't know or didn't answer. An additional 7% thought that the Supreme Court had overturned it last year. Another 12% thought that it had been repealed by Congress and is no longer a law. Those that still know Obamacare is around remain divided on how they feel about it. A more recent poll from CNN found that only 43% of the public ""supports the health care law."" This might lead you to think that most of the country wants it repealed. But, as with so many things related to health care reform, there's more than meets the eye here. A full 16% of Americans, about a third of those who ""oppose the health care law,"" do so because it's not liberal enough. It's important to remember that in many ways Obamacare was a ""centrist"" solution. Many don't like to hear that, believing that it's socialism-writ-large, but a sizeable chunk of America supported something like Medicare-for-all, a single-payer solution more like what Canadians, or our elderly, enjoy. Many of them still think that's a better choice for health care reform. In other words, it might be fairer to say that 59% of Americans support a system that is as liberal or more liberal than Obamacare, while 35% don't. That's a much different interpretation than what many are repeating. Regardless, it's clear that many are still unclear about what's going on with the law or how they feel about it. It's not surprising, therefore, that the Obama administration is gearing up for another big push to sell its brand of reform to the American people. This is a critical time for the law. For better or worse, the Republican Party, for the most part, stands in total opposition to Obamacare. Many have called the law a ""train wreck"" waiting to happen, and they believe that letting the law fail, spectacularly, is the quickest way to get rid of that. Because of this, few, if any, opponents of the law are willing to make any concessions or changes to it at all. This is a relatively new thing when it comes to major legislation. Past laws on this scale, including the Children's Health Insurance Program, Medicare, and Social Security were amended and changed years and even months after being passed. That's incredibly unlikely to happen with respect to Obamacare. Moreover, many are doing all they can actively to prevent the law from moving forward. About half of states have refused to partake in the Medicaid expansion, meaning that the majority of the poorest among us will not get Medicaid next year as the law originally planned. Many states are also dragging their feet with respect to the insurance exchanges, hoping that if the federal government fails to get things going in time, Americans will see that the law is unsuccessful. Widespread belief in this might help Republicans increase their electoral power to the point that they can demand repeal. This strategy could backfire, though. California, one of the states most thoroughly embracing Obamacare, recently had its rates published for its insurance exchange. The cost of insurance premiums came in significantly below what had been projected. Back in 2009, projections for a ""silver"" plan for a 40 year old were $5,200-5,400 a year. Last week, though, California announced that the most affordable ""silver"" plan would cost just over $3,300 a year. That is, of course, the cost without subsidies. For the many Americans who make less than 400% of the poverty line, the cost to them will be even less. Some will claim that this is still a rate increase for some. That's likely true. There is almost no policy that works out perfectly for everyone. It's likely that some very young, healthy people will spend more on their insurance now for the chance to have it cheaper -- and guaranteed -- later. There are also some who will chafe at having to buy insurance at all. But the gambit of those opposing Obamacare seems to be a full throated and all-out-effort to show that Obamacare doesn't work. The danger, though, is that it might. The jury is still out, of course. But it's important to recognize that full-out opposition to reform like this is somewhat novel in American politics. No one knows what such a strategy will bring in the long run. Many thought passing the Affordable Care Act would be President Obama's ""Waterloo."" It wasn't. In fact, some have argued that the flat out refusal to negotiate in the law's passage cost opponents the chance to get a final product more to their liking. Things are shaping up similarly now. If, a year from now, it appears that exchanges are working out in states that embraced them, and that the Medicaid expansion is succeeding in states that allowed it, then it may turn out that refusing to bend may have instead caused the opposition to break. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron Carroll.","Aaron Carroll: Obamacare's major changes go into effect in 2014; misconceptions remain .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo has reacted to suggestions double Formula One world champion Sebastian Vettel is set to join the Italian team in 2014 by saying he didn't want ""two roosters in the same hen house"". Media reports on Monday suggested Red Bull driver Vettel, who went top of the 2012 drivers' championship after winning at the Korean Grand Prix, would move to Ferrari in 2014 to replace Brazil's Felipe Massa. But Di Montezemolo suggested it would be difficult to accommodate two drivers as ambitious as Vettel and fellow two-time title winner Alonso. ""Today the problem is not with drivers,"" Di Montezemolo told the team's official website. ""2014 is still to come but I don't want to have two roosters in the same hen house, rather two drivers who race for Ferrari and not for themselves. ""I don't want problems and rivalries, which we didn't have between (Michael) Schumacher and (Eddie) Irvine, between Schumacher and (Rubens) Barrichello, between Alonso and Massa or Massa and Schumacher or Massa and (Kimi) Raikkonen. The possibility of Vettel, who leads Alonso by six points with four races of the season remaining, joining Ferrari in the future were also quashed by his representatives when contacted by CNN.

""As for Newey, I can say that he is very good at his job,"" said the Ferrari president, ""but we also managed to win eight constructors' titles in the last 13 championships without him: I have huge faith in our own engineers."" Di Montezemolo also revealed he will be meeting Massa to discuss his future with the team. Massa, who took fourth at the Korean Grand Prix, finished second at the recent Japanese Grand Prix, his first podium finish in two years. ""We have the best team: yesterday too, the work on track was perfect,"" he continued referring to Massa's fourth place finish in Korea.

"(CNN) -- Crews in Southern California struggled to get the upper hand on a fast-moving wildfire in Santa Barbara County early Tuesday. Known as the White Fire, the blaze had already charred some 1,000 acres after getting its start Monday afternoon, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Andrew Madsen said. The flames were 5% contained. The Forest Service expects to have 700 personnel in place Tuesday morning. The Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department evacuated up to 6,000 people from the popular White Rock Campground at the end of the busy Memorial Day weekend as the wildfire advanced, public information officer Kelly Hoover said. Although the fire caused minor damage to a ranger station, it quickly moved deeper into Los Padres National Forest, away from homes and structures, according to Madsen. No injuries or fatalities have been reported. Santa Barbara is located about 85 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.","The White Fire covers 1,000 acres and is 5% contained .

"(CNN) -- Two-wheeled temptation has proved too much for retired MotoGP champion Casey Stoner. Eight months ago the Australian quit the sport but now he is getting back on the bike to test for Honda. Stoner will reunite with his old team in four tests at the Motegi circuit starting next month. ""This will allow me to enjoy what I miss -- riding a MotoGP bike!"" said Stoner. ""I can't wait to get on the RCV [motorcycle] to see how it has changed from last year."" Stoner was Repsol Honda's defending MotoGP world champion before he made a shock decision to walk away from the sport at the end of the 2012 season. Explaining his thoughts at the time, he said: ""The sport has changed a lot and it has changed to the point where I am not enjoying it. ""There are a lot of things that have disappointed me, and also a lot of things I have loved about this sport, but unfortunately the balance has gone in the wrong direction."" Stoner's return to help out Honda has led to speculation the double world champion could be tempted to make a full-time return in 2014. But the Australian, who is now competing in the second tier of the Australian V8 Supercars series this year, says that is not part of the plan. ""It's been almost seven months now since Valencia and I'm still happy and comfortable with the decision I made to stop motorcycle racing, even if sometimes I miss riding my RCV,"" he said. ""That's why I am happy with Honda's offer to do some tests in Motegi this year!""

That win -- which included a stunning move on Yamaha's Valentino Rossi -- made him the youngest MotoGP rider to notch up back-to-back victories and the first to win at the California racetrack on debut. ""Before I came here, I was expecting to struggle more,"" Marquez told MotoGP.com. ""From the TV, this circuit looked so tricky. ""At the beginning with a full fuel tank, I was a little bit scared.

"(CNN) -- In a weekend filled with crashes, rookie Marc Marquez avoided the mayhem. Marquez took the lead in the MotoGP standings after winning the German Grand Prix in his Honda ahead of Yamaha pair Cal Crutchlow and nine-time world champion Valentino Rossi. Marquez, on pole, lost the lead on the first lap as Rossi pounced but recovered by lap three. In the end he beat Crutchlow by a comfortable 1.559 seconds over the 30 laps, with the revitalized Rossi a further eight seconds adrift in eastern Germany. ""I hadn't expected to control the race like that,"" said the 20-year-old Marquez, who suffered his own share of crashes earlier in the season. Marquez now leads teammate Dani Pedrosa by two points -- 138 to 136 -- although 10 races remain. Pedrosa, the winner in Germany the previous three years, injured his left shoulder in a heavy crash in practice Saturday and missed qualifying. Tests revealed he suffered a minor fracture and on Sunday morning he decided not to take part in the race. Reigning world champion Jorge Lorenzo broke his left collarbone in practice for the Dutch Grand Prix last month and suffered more damage when he lost control of his Yamaha in practice Friday. Altogether there were nearly 20 crashes over the weekend on the Sachsenring, a circuit with an abundance of challenging left turns. With less than 10 laps remaining, it appeared as if Crutchlow -- nursing a hand injury himself -- was ready to make a charge. He narrowed Marquez's lead from 1.8 seconds to about 1.6. But Marquez didn't lose more ground and coasted home for a second victory this term, adding to his win in Texas in April. ""I'm happy,"" said Marquez. ""It's great to win, but you shouldn't forget that both Pedrosa and Lorenzo weren't here."" Even though he didn't challenge for the lead most of the race, Rossi claimed a second consecutive podium finish after winning the Dutch Grand Prix -- the first time he stood atop the podium in three years. ""I am happy, but I had thought I'd do better,"" said Rossi. ""I had a few problems with the rear tires."" It's not known whether Lorenzo and Pedrosa will be ready for next week's race in California.","Rookie Marc Marquez leapfrogs Dani Pedrosa in the overall MotoGP standings .

"(CNN) -- MotoGP world champion Jorge Lorenzo will be kept under observation in hospital after flying off his bike in a 200-kilometers an hour crash during a wet practice session at Assen Thursday. Lorenzo will miss Saturday's race in the Netherlands after being caught out by standing water on the track and flying over his handlebars, eventually landing heavily on his left shoulder and fracturing his collarbone. The Spaniard, who won in Spain and Italy, came off during the second session of practice at Turn 13. According to race organizers, Lorenzo will be flown to Barcelona for surgery late Saturday or early Sunday. Xavier Mir, the doctor who carried out the examination on Lorenzo, confirmed the rider would undergo scans and be kept in for observation. ""Jorge has suffered an accident at over 200 kilometers an hour and the obvious injury at this point is a broken left clavicle,"" he told the competition's official website. ""However, as this was a significant accident, we have to take into account that there could also be head, thoracic or abdominal injuries. ""For now, we have taken him to hospital in Assen where CT scans will be carried out in those three areas to rule out any further injuries. ""It would also be a prudent move to observe him over 12 hours to make sure he can be treated by the appropriate parties when he arrives in Barcelona tomorrow (Friday)."" Lorenzo had moved to within seven points of world championship leader Dani Pedrosa following his recent victories. But he will now have to watch from the sidelines at a venue where he failed to make it past the first corner last year.","Jorge Lorenzo kept in hospital following high-speed crash .

"(CNN) -- When the MotoGP season began, not many would have picked Marc Marquez to win the individual title. He was a rookie making the transition from Moto2 and replacing one of the sport's greats, Casey Stoner, at Honda. He also had to contend with reigning world champion Jorge Lorenzo and perennial contender Dani Pedrosa. According to British oddsmaker William Hill, Marquez was merely the joint third favorite at 7/2, behind Lorenzo and Pedrosa and tied with motorcycling legend Valentino Rossi. But Marquez's brash style -- along with shoulder injuries to Lorenzo and Pedrosa -- saw the Spaniard move into contention and it appears nothing can stop the 20-year-old from becoming the first rookie to claim the MotoGP crown in 35 years. His odds of winning the title now stand at a miniscule 1/9. ""There are no excuses,"" Lorenzo said. ""Marc was faster than us and he was better. I can only congratulate him and look forward to the next race."" Lorenzo was speaking to reporters Sunday, after Marquez captured Spain's Aragon Grand Prix -- but they were words he could have uttered for much of the campaign. Marquez chased down Yamaha's Lorenzo -- it wasn't the first time this season that happened -- before easing to the finish line. It ended Lorenzo's two-race winning streak and boosted Marquez's overall advantage to a substantial 39 points with only four races remaining. ""I didn't expect this before the start of the season,"" Marquez was quoted as saying by Australian news agency AAP this month. ""My goal was just to take some podiums and try to fight for some victories in the end of the season. ""At the moment I want to go race by race but for sure we have some possibility (to win the crown). ""We don't have any pressure because we have already done better than what we expected."" Pedrosa probably wasn't all that impressed with Marquez, his teammate, on Sunday. They touched on lap 6 as Marquez seemed to out-brake himself and Pedrosa crashed seconds later, hurting his hip and groin. ""Marc went in too wide on the corner entry, clipped me from the outside and I went flying when I got on the gas,"" Pedrosa told the team website. ""My mechanics told me later that the traction-control cable had been cut by the contact."" Marquez apologized. ""The team told me I caused his traction-control cable to snap and I'm sorry for that,"" Marquez told the team website. ""It's something very unusual to see."" But seeing Marquez atop the standings has become commonplace.","With four races remaining, Marc Marquez leads the MotoGP standings by 39 points .

"(CNN) -- A Tennessee compounding pharmacy on probation has voluntarily recalled an anti-inflammatory steroid injection in at least 11 states after seven patients developed abscesses in North Carolina and Illinois, officials said Friday. State and federal health organizations are investigating Main Street Family Pharmacy, LLC, in Newbern, Tennessee, and its preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate, or MPA, a steroid product used for a range of conditions. The pharmacy ""is currently on probation as a result of a recent inspection,"" the Tennessee Department of Health said in a statement. The agency didn't provide further details. The Tennessee Board of Pharmacy licensed the compounding pharmacy in 1985, the state health agency said. It was licensed as a manufacturer/wholesaler/distributor in 2010, the state agency said. Officials with the compounding pharmacy couldn't be immediately reached for comment Friday. Cooperating with authorities, the pharmacy has voluntarily recalled all of its sterile products, including MPA, authorities said. No cases of meningitis or other life-threatening infections have been reported, authorities said. ""Health officials believe, in reviewing preliminary information about when the material could have been appropriately used, there is not an ongoing risk to those now needing treatments,"" the Tennessee health agency said. Melthyprednisone acetate is an injectable form of a popular steroid medication and is used to treat inflammation throughout the body. It's most commonly used to treat arthritic joint pain, but can also be used for other conditions like allergic reactions, sports-related injuries, immune system disorders, certain cancers and various other types of inflammatory diseases. In the wake of the recent complications, the Food and Drug Administration and Tennessee health officials began inspecting the facility on Wednesday. ""The pharmacy staff and management have been cooperative,"" the state health agency said. ""The pharmacy has agreed to stop sterile compounding pending resolution of the current investigation."" Five people in Illinois developed abscesses after receiving injections of MPA, state health authorities said. All five Illinois patients received the shots at Logan Primary Care clinic in Herrin between January 3 and February 21, officials said. Two people in North Carolina developed complications after receiving the injections at a clinic in Greenville, state health officials said. The pharmacy shipped MPA to a total of three North Carolina clinics: Carolina Arthritis Center in Pitt County, Bailey Family Practice Center in Nash County, and Shallote Medical Center in Brunswick County. State and local health officials are now working with those three facilities. Illinois health authorities said that one of the cases in North Carolina ""indicates a fungal infection as the cause of an abscess that developed after injection with MPA from the compounding pharmacy."" North Carolina authorities said skin abscesses have been the complications identified so far. The Tennessee pharmacy ""has agreed to voluntary surrender its North Carolina pharmacy license,"" according to a statement by North Carolina Board of Pharmacy and the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. Besides Illinois and North Carolina, the Tennessee pharmacy has distributed the steroid injection to nine more states: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, and South Carolina. CNN's Matt Sloane contributed to this report.","Main Street Family Pharmacy in Tennessee voluntarily recalls steroid product in 11 states .

"(CNN)  -- Amid conservative opposition, a bill that would designate a day of ""significance"" in California for slain gay politician Harvey Milk is heading to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's desk. Harvey Milk was California's first openly gay elected official. He was assassinated in 1978. The legislation would denote May 22 -- Milk's birthday -- as a day of significance across the state. The governor's office said Tuesday it had received more than 100,000 constituent phone calls about the bill, although it was not immediately clear if most were in favor of it or opposed. The governor's office said Schwarzenegger has not taken a position on it yet. Milk, the state's first openly gay elected official, served briefly as San Francisco's supervisor before he and Mayor George Moscone were assassinated in 1978. Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar bill last year, saying he believed Milk ""should be continued to be recognized at the local level by those who were most impacted by his contributions."" State Sen. Mark Leno, a Democrat who authored the current bill as well as last year's, said in a written statement that the governor had ""contradicted"" his veto message by announcing that the gay rights icon will be inducted into the California Hall of Fame. Milk was a ""unique"" historical figure who led a civil rights movement and then was ""assassinated in his public office for being who he was,"" Leno said. ""In a perfect world, we'd have a state holiday for him, like [the Rev.] Martin Luther King Jr. or Cesar Chavez,"" Leno said in a telephone interview. But the California state finances are in such ""disarray ... we think it's appropriate in light of our fiscal crisis"" to have a special day of significance that won't cost the state anything, said Leno, whose district includes portions of San Francisco. That way, he said, Milk is still afforded ""the respect that he's due."" The day of significance would not close schools or state offices, according to its text. However, Randy Thomasson, the president of SaveCalifornia.com, said the bill was vague and could allow for a number of things at schools, including gay pride parades or ""mock gay weddings."" ""There's no definition in the bill,"" he said. ""There is absolutely no limit to what could occur on campuses and go into little children's brains."" ""Harvey Milk was a terrible role model for children,"" Thomasson said. His organization plans to oppose the bill through automatic phone calls, e-mails, media interviews and news conferences, he added. Leno said that claims that the bill would lead to schools holding gay-pride parades and similar activities were ""hyperbole."" The bill ""mandates nothing,"" he said, although it certainly ""affords an educational opportunity."" President Obama also posthumously honored Milk with a Presidential Medal of Freedom this year, and Sean Penn portrayed him in this year's film ""Milk,"" which garnered him an Oscar for best actor. CNN's Taylor Gandossy contributed to this report.","Bill setting aside day of statewide significance for Milk heading to governor .

"(CNN) -- An ice jam on the Yukon River in Alaska sparked flooding in the city of Galena, where some 300 people have been evacuated, authorities said. Most of the people who left their homes were being housed in either Ruby or Fairbanks, said Kerry Seifert, operations section chief at the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. Some are at shelters, while others were with friends and relatives. ""We expect the flooding to become worse before the waters start to recede,"" said Alaska Gov. Sean Parnell, who surveyed the damage this week. ""Ensuring the safety of those impacted by the flooding remains my top priority."" According to Seifert, the cause of the jam was a late break up of ice. Colder temperatures meant there was no melting until a rapid warming put lots of water in the river basin. A wall of ice got hung up at a steep curve in the river near Galena, he said. Water appeared to be beginning to move around the sides of the ice Wednesday, Seifert said, which could be good news for people living in Galena.

"(CNN) -- Two different terror attacks by two different sets of Islamic extremists in two different democracies. But the difference in people's responses is what's key, and exemplifies why America truly is exceptional. I'm referring to the bombing in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 15 and the attack on a British soldier on a London street on May 22. After the Boston attack, which claimed the lives of three people and injured more than 250 others, a minor anti-Muslim backlash was reported. The most notable: A Bangladeshi man in New York City was allegedly beaten and a Muslim woman in Boston was struck in the shoulder and called a terrorist. And sure the professional Islamophobes, who make their living spewing hate, came out to sell their rancid goods of division and distrust. However, thankfully, and unsurprisingly, Americans weren't buying it. But in England, the backlash against British Muslims has been alarming. Since the terror attack on May 22, there have been 193 anti-Muslim incidents in England, that's 15 times the average number. These hate crimes ranged from vandalizing mosques to pulling off women's headscarves, to threats of violence against Muslims and to minor assaults. One of the most serious incidents happened Sunday night when three firebombs were thrown at the Grimsby Islamic Cultural Center in Lincolnshire, while worshipers were inside in the mosque. Luckily no one was killed. According to British media reports, this wave of anti-Muslim fever was not spontaneous. It has been an organized campaign of hate led by the right-wing group English Defence League, which held protests on the streets of London and Newcastle this past weekend. At its London event, EDL's leader Tommy Robinson told supporters: ""They've had their Arab spring. This is time for the English spring."" Of course, the terrorists who killed the British soldier were of Nigerian heritage, not Arab. But then again, bigots aren't the brightest, whether they're English or American. Obviously, the anti-Muslim attacks and rallies orchestrated by the EDL don't represent mainstream British society. In fact, an anti-racism rally was held in London to counter the EDL's march. And comedian and actor Russell Brand wrote a heartfelt column for the UK's popular The Sun tabloid, imploring his fellow Brits to remain tolerant and not blame all Muslims for the sins of two madmen. Another bright spot: At a smaller EDL protest in York, Muslims invited the protesters into their mosque and found some common ground in a properly British way, with tea and cookies and an impromptu game of soccer. But why didn't we see an angry anti-Muslim backlash in the United States after the Boston bombings killed and injured so many more people? A few reasons. Not only did the American-Muslim community quickly denounce the Boston bombing, but people of other faiths publicly stood with American-Muslims, including Jewish and Christian leaders in the Boston area. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying all Americans love Muslims. But there's a difference between not feeling too warmly about a minority group and actually advocating discrimination and hatred and committing violence against them. But the bigger reason we didn't see a backlash like the one in England has to do with who we are as Americans. Our nation's DNA can be found on the words affixed to the seal of the United States of America: ""E Pluribus Unum"" which means ""Out of many, one."" To most Americans, Republicans and Democrats both, these words are more than rhetoric. It's the promise our Founding Fathers offered, to welcome people from all different backgrounds to become one with us as Americans. America was, and still remains, a melting pot. And since its creation, that melting pot has grown; it has become bigger, more colorful and more vibrant. Sure, some are troubled by our increasing diversity. We see it in the angry rhetoric from those on the far right toward those who don't look, pray or act like them. And we regrettably see it in the hate crimes perpetrated against people simply because they are different. We need to look no further than New York City, the ""bluest"" city in the ""bluest state,"" to see a spike in reports of hate crimes against gays, with 29 so far this year compared with 14 last year. Mark Carson, a gay man, was killed on May 18 while he was walking the streets of Greenwich Village. Carson was murdered simply because of his sexual orientation. We may never be able to end all hate crimes in a nation of more than 300 million people. But we must remain vigilant in countering the voices of intolerance and hatred. The reaction to the Boston bombings, in such marked contrast to England's reaction to the killing of the soldier, shows we are on the right path. By staying on this path, we will ensure that the United States remains truly exceptional.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A New York Times reporter who was kidnapped last week was freed Wednesday in a pre-dawn military raid in Afghanistan that left a British commando, an Afghan journalist and several others dead. New York Times reporter Stephen Farrell was abducted Saturday while covering a NATO airstrike in Afghanistan. Stephen Farrell was rescued by NATO's International Security Assistance Force, known as the ISAF, the British Foreign Office said. A British commando died in the operation, the country's Ministry of Defense said without offering further details. Sultan Munad, an Afghan journalist accompanying Farrell, also was killed in the raid, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said. Crossfire during the raid also killed a woman and a child, said Abdel Wahid Omar Khil, governor of Kunduz district, in Kunduz province, where the rescue took place. Armed gunmen kidnapped the journalists Saturday while they were covering a NATO airstrike on Taliban forces the day before that killed at least 90 people in the northern Kunduz province. Neither CNN nor the Times had reported Farrell's kidnapping for security reasons. ""We feared that media attention would raise the temperature and increase the risk to the captives,"" the paper quoted Executive Editor Bill Keller as saying Wednesday. Farrell called the newspaper's foreign editor before dawn and said he was ""extracted"" in a commando raid after a fierce firefight, according to a report on the Times Web site. ""There were bullets all around us. I could hear British and Afghan voices,"" Farrell, a 46-year-old dual Irish-British citizen, told the paper. Farrell and Munadi ran outside during the firefight. At the end of a wall, Munadi went forward, shouting: ""Journalist! Journalist!"" but dropped in a hail of bullets, Farrell said. He didn't know whether the shots came from allied or militant fire. ""I saw him go down in front of me. He did not move. He's dead,"" Farrell told the paper. ""He was so close, he was just 2 feet in front of me when he dropped."" Farrell's citizenship played a role in the British decision to stage the rescue, said a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.  Watch a former British commander on the difficulty in rescuing hostages » . ""The obvious link for us is that Farrell is a British national. We want to safeguard the life of one of our citizens,"" the spokesman said, declining to discuss operational details of the rescue mission. ""We don't comment about the actions of British Special Ops forces."" Local Afghans provided information and helped the commandos locate where Farrell was being held, said another British official who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. He said the judgment to proceed with such an operation ""is always a difficult one, but we think it represented the best chance to save his life."" Brown offered condolences to the families of Munadi and the British commando. Of the commando, Brown said, ""His bravery will not be forgotten."" The operation to rescue the hostages happened after extensive planning and consideration, Brown said. ""Those involved knew the high risks they were running. That they undertook it in such circumstances showed breathtaking heroism,"" Brown said. ""Hostage-taking is never justified, and the U.K. does not make substantive concessions, including paying ransoms. But whenever British nationals are kidnapped, we and our allies will do everything in our power to free them."" Ten weeks earlier, another Times reporter escaped after months in Taliban captivity. David Rohde, a local reporter and a driver were kidnapped November 10 outside Kabul. The two reporters escaped on June 19 by climbing over a wall in the compound where they were held for seven months in Pakistan's North Waziristan region. The driver did not escape, the newspaper said. The death toll in the Kunduz airstrike, which Farrell was covering when he was kidnapped, has varied, depending on the source, but local Afghan officials have said at least half of those killed were civilians. The NATO commander in the area called in the strike Friday as Afghans tried to siphon fuel from two tankers hijacked by the Taliban a day earlier. The Taliban allowed villagers to drain the tankers carrying fuel earmarked for the NATO-led force after they became stuck in the mud when the militants tried to drive them through the Kunduz River. The military thought there were no civilians near the trucks at the time of the attack, the ISAF's Capt. Elizabeth Mathias said. Farrell, who joined The New York Times two years ago, also was briefly kidnapped in April 2004 in Falluja, Iraq. At the time, he was on assignment for The Times of London. In a separate incident Wednesday, a suicide attack killed at least two civilians and injured several others, including NATO personnel, near the main British military base in southern Afghanistan, the ISAF said. The suicide bomber detonated his explosives vest near a crowd of civilian truck drivers near the entrance of Camp Bastion in volatile Helmand province, the ISAF said. The injured civilians and ISAF personnel were treated at Camp Bastion, which is in Washir District. The casualty count is unclear as an investigation continues.

"(CNN) -- Former Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo appeared in a New York court Tuesday and pleaded not guilty to charges that he laundered $70 million through U.S. banks while in power. Portillo, who was extradited to the United States last week, has always denied the charges against him and says the accusations are based on the lies of political enemies. ""This is a case of clear overreaching by the Department of Justice and the United States government against former Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo, who is innocent of all the charges against him,"" defense attorney David M. Rosenfield told reporters on Tuesday. ""Former President Portillo was tried on many of these same charges in a politically motivated criminal case in Guatemala in early 2011, and was acquitted on all charges. The acquittal was upheld on appeal,"" he said. ""Former President Portillo intends to vigorously defend himself against the current charges against him and fully expects to be acquitted here just as he was acquitted in Guatemala."" U.S. prosecutors have said Portillo, who led the Central American country from 2000 to 2004, used his authority to launder and misappropriate millions of dollars. ""Portillo is charged with converting the office of the Guatemalan presidency into his personal ATM,"" Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York, said in a 2010 statement. ""Through various alleged embezzlement schemes, including one which involved $1.5 million intended for Guatemalan school children, Portillo abused the trust of his nation's people."" An indictment unsealed in New York federal court accuses Portillo of embezzling tens of millions of dollars worth of public funds, ""a substantial portion of which he laundered through American and European bank accounts."" After the United States made an extradition request, Guatemalan authorities arrested him on a farm on the country's coast in 2010. Guatemalan courts and the country's president authorized his extradition to the United States in 2011, but the transfer did not happen until Friday. In court Tuesday, Portillo wore a gray suit and a maroon tie. He had a pair of headphones for translation. His attorneys have asked for a bail hearing within two weeks. Portillo has said that he never laundered money in U.S. banks. ""In the United States, it is a revenge of the richest group of the American right,"" he said in an interview with CNN en EspaÃ±ol in January. ""They are charging me for being the only president who did not support, with his signature nor with his permission, the invasion in Iraq."" ""If deposits were made,"" he said, ""they are deposits that first of all come from institutions that are not illicit. In order for there to be laundering, the first requirement is that the money is from an illegal origin or comes from an illegal activity."" Portillo responded directly to the charge concerning the $1.5 million that the United States says was intended for schoolchildren. That money, Portillo said, was something he had requested and received before he became president. From the beginning, that money was raised to create a trust fund to support his daughter's studies, and that's what it was used for, Portillo said. Despite his claims that his rights have been violated during the extradition process, Portillo said he believes he will get a fair trial in the United States. ""I have confidence that at least I will have a transparent, impartial, objective trial that is based on reliable evidence and not just testimonies that are based on falsehoods,"" he said. A fair trial would not be possible in Guatemala, he added. Twist in Guatemalan case: Genocide conviction overturned . Guatemala confronts a dark chapter .

"(CNN) -- A new study by Pew Research Center finds that, more and more, married mothers are earning more than their husbands -- about 23%, up from 4% in 1960. That's nearly one in four families. And although men say they support equality, they are struggling with this new reality. Take Mina and Rich. They had been married for five years when Mina was appointed dean of admissions at an elite liberal arts college across the country. The couple decided that Rich, a busy attorney in private practice, would take some time off to stay home with their two children, who were 1 and 3, until they decided whether the new town, and her new job, would be a long-term fit. The new arrangement worked out well, at least at the start. But a few months into her new job, Mina wondered if Rich was really as happy as he insisted he was. She wondered the same about herself. Although Rich was home all day, he still often expected Mina to cook dinner. Laundry piled up. He hadn't made an effort to make friends or form any connections outside the house. ""I began to worry about our marriage for the first time ever,"" Mina told me. ""As if I'd forced some change on him. He'd become a different person."" Although most men say they support -- even welcome -- the idea of a dual income household and equality in marriage, evidence shows that men whose wives earn more may actually be suffering on a number of levels. And that although the social pressure that once discouraged women from working outside the home has given way, the pressure on husbands to be the primary earner remains. Samantha and Andrei were both struggling artists when they met. But when they decided to start a family, at least one of them needed a full-time job. They decided it would be Samantha, who had sidelined in real estate for a few months after college. Turns out, she was very good at selling houses. Although Samantha's job afforded Andrei the ability to continue with his art, he seemed to grow more discontent by the week. He began to see a therapist, who suggested that he try antidepressants. ""I kept having to tell myself that not having to go out and sell houses was a good thing,"" he told me. ""It sounds horrible, in fact. I was not jealous of her at all. And yet, she was the reason we could afford to pay our mortgage, or go on vacation. She was the one who made life possible for our daughter. And that was hard to accept, even when I could recognize I was thankful I didn't have to make the sacrifices she was making."" Andrei's feelings are entirely common. In ""Breadwinner Wives and the Men They Marry,"" Randi Minetor writes that many unemployed or under-earning men feel wounded by what they see as their diminished status. Their self-esteem can suffer. This can eventually lead to feelings of resentment toward their spouse â€” sometimes conscious, but often unconscious â€” even if a guy has purposely opted to stay home, take time off, or willingly embark on a less fruitful career. A recent study of more than 200,000 men conducted by Washington University's Olin Business School and published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin found that men whose wives are the primary earner are about 10% more likely to require medication to combat such issues as insomnia, anxiety and erectile dysfunction. Research conducted at Cornell and presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, meanwhile, found that men who earn significantly less than their female partners are five times more likely to cheat than those in relationships where incomes are more comparable. But the answer, of course, isn't for women to revert to their traditional roles of cooking, cleaning and tending to the children while the man of the house is off bringing home the bacon. As more and more women rise to powerful positions in the workplace, the incidence of female breadwinners will continue to grow. Husbands of these wives who may be experiencing feelings of depression and low self-esteem would be wise to have an honest conversation with their spouse, and themselves, to find out what's really bothering them. Oftentimes, it may not be the fact that their spouse earns more, but that their spouse may have less time to spend at home, or may be neglecting other areas of the relationship. For those men who are considering following a less career-oriented path, it's important for the couple to make a decision together. Neither member of the couple should feel as if they were forced into a decision, or ""trapped."" Keeping dialogue open between partners helps reinforce the fact that although the man is not working, or is earning less, he is still an equal partner. In the case of stay-at-home fathers, it's important for men to counter any issues of isolation and boredom by making sure they maintain friendships and interests outside the house. Eventually, through hours and hours of conversations with Mina and many ups and downs at home, Rich came to not only accept his role as stay-at-home dad, and the lesser earner, but also to enjoy the opportunities it afforded him. He was able to coach their son's soccer team, and he never missed a ballet recital. Once the kids began school, he reopened his private law practice part-time, taking only those cases that truly interested him. ""I'd been worried he was becoming a different person, and he did become one,"" Mina told me. ""But turns out different was better. At least for us.""

"(CNN) -- Joe Paterno led the Penn State Nittany Lions for 46 seasons and -- in the process -- became the winningest coach in college football history. Then came the child molestation scandal involving his former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky and allegations that Paterno played a role in concealing it. The NCAA vacated 111 of his wins over a 14-year period, fined the school $60 million, reduced scholarships and banned it from bowl games for four years. Paterno died last year, his iconic reputation in tatters. But his relatives filed a lawsuit Thursday to see that his legacy doesn't end that way. The lawsuit -- filed by the Paterno family, several members of the Penn State Board of Trustees, faculty, former players and coaches -- takes to task the NCAA and a report by former FBI director Louis Freeh, whom the sports body hired to conduct an independent investigation of Penn State's handling of the scandal. ""The report on which the NCAA relied for its actions is fundamentally wrong, incomplete and inaccurate,"" a release from the parties filing the lawsuit said. ""The consent decree with Penn State was hastily imposed on the University, completely disregarding the rights of the affected parties."" The 40-page suit, filed in Common Pleas Court of Centre County, Pennsylvania, Thursday, is the second filed against the college sports governing body. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett filed an anti-trust lawsuit in January against the NCAA on the grounds that its punishments for the university are ""overreaching and unlawful."" Paterno legacy shadowed by sex abuse scandal . Severe penalties . Paterno coached at Penn State for 62 years as an assistant and head coach, but was fired after authorities arrested Sandusky. In 2002, a graduate assistant brought to Paterno allegations of Sandusky's sexual abuse in one of Penn State's facilities. Paterno informed his supervisors of the report, but the school's board of trustees fired Paterno in November 2011, saying he could no longer perform his duties in the shadow of scandal. Sandusky was convicted in June 2012 on 45 counts of child sex abuse. He was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison. Penn State supporters mark anniversary of Paterno's death . Top figures at Penn State blamed . Freeh's 267-page review blamed Paterno, former university President Graham Spanier, suspended Athletic Director Tim Curley and ex-Vice President Gary Schultz for allegedly taking part in a cover-up to avoid bad publicity. Joe Paterno's family fights back . The scandal led to Spanier's ouster and shocked the nation after Freeh's team concluded that the school's top administrators had ""empowered"" Sandusky, the former defensive coordinator for the football team, to continue his abuse. In addition to overturning the sanctions, the lawsuit seeks money for damages and legal costs. The Paterno estate says it will donate any money it receives from the lawsuit to charity. ""The one thing everyone should agree on is that the Sandusky scandal deserves a thorough, fair and careful review,"" said Wick Sollers, the attorney for those filing the lawsuit. ""The NCAA's actions sought to limit the knowledge of the case and trample the rights of the individuals and institutions that were unfairly and inaccurately blamed by the Freeh report."" Sollers previously issued a critique of the Freeh report, calling it a ""rush to injustice regarding Joe Paterno."" The Paterno report . Paterno family: Freeh report 'factually wrong' This is not the first time the Paterno family has fought back. In February, it released a report that absolved the coaching great of blame in the Sandusky scandal and said the Freeh report, commissioned by Penn State, was ""factually wrong, speculative and fundamentally flawed."" Former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh put together the new report. ""The experts determined that the conclusions of the (university) report are based on raw speculation and unsupported opinion - not facts and evidence,"" Thornburgh said, according to a statement from the family. The statement said Paterno never attempted to hide any information or impede any investigation into Sandusky's activities while using Penn State facilities.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A controversial Japanese politician apologized Monday for suggesting that U.S. military service members should use the adult entertainment industry in Japan more often to relieve sexual frustration and reduce aggression. But he didn't back down over comments he made about the Japanese military's use of forced prostitution during World War II. Japanese politician calls wartime sex slaves 'necessary' Toru Hashimoto, the mayor of Osaka, stirred outrage in Japan and around the world with a series of comments this month about the treatment of women by the military. He had said May 13 that he had told a U.S. military commander during a trip to a base on the island of Okinawa that the adult entertainment business in Japan should be ""utilized more"" by U.S. personnel. ""I told him there are places that operate within the boundaries of the law which can be used for releasing sexual frustration, so they (the U.S. military) should fully utilize it or the Marines won't be able to control their aggressive sexual desires."" In a statement delivered Monday at the Foreign Correspondent's Club of Japan in Tokyo, Hashimoto acknowledged that his comment ""could be construed as an insult to the U.S. forces and to the American people, and therefore was inappropriate."" Hashimoto, who is also a co-leader of the nationalist Japan Restoration Party, said he retracted the remark and apologized for it. He said it was prompted by ""a strong sense of crisis"" he felt in light of a series of recent sexual abuse cases involving U.S. service members in Japan. Opinion: Japanese politicians still struggle with wartime past . 'Comfort women' controversy . But he said comments attributed to him that described women forced to become prostitutes to entertain Japanese troops during World War II as ""necessary"" had been taken out of context. On May 13, he said ""anyone would understand"" the role of ""comfort women"" when soldiers were risking their lives and you wanted to give them ""a rest."" ""Comfort women"" is the term used for the 200,000 women whom historians estimate were forced to become sex slaves for Japan's former Imperial Army. Hashimoto's comments about them had provoked an international outcry, especially in Asian countries occupied by Japan during the war, such as South Korea and China. The U.S. government called the words ""outrageous and offensive."" Hashimoto didn't offer an apology Monday for those comments, claiming that he had been talking about sexual violations by military personnel in a more general sense. He also disputed that forcible recruitment of women during the war was conducted as government policy. ""I stated that 'the armed forces of nations in the world' seemed to have needed women 'during the past wars,' "" he said. ""Then it was wrongly reported that I myself thought it as necessary for armed forces to use women and that 'I' tolerated it."" Japan not only culprit, mayor says . He repeated the assertion he made previously that ""sexual violation in wartime was not an issue unique to the former Japanese army."" ""The issue existed in the armed forces of the U.S.A., the UK, France, Germany and the former Soviet Union among others during World War II,"" he said. ""It also existed in the armed forces of the Republic of Korea during the Korean War and the Vietnam War,"" Hashimoto added, using the official name of South Korea. ""If only Japan is blamed, because of the widely held view that the state authority of Japan was intentionally involved in the abduction and trafficking of women, I will have to inform you that this view is incorrect,"" he said. He did, however, recognize that the Japanese military had caused suffering to comfort women. ""We must express our deep remorse at the violation of the human rights of these women by the Japanese soldiers in the past, and make our apology to the women,"" he said. In 1993, the Japanese government released a statement acknowledging the ""immeasurable pain and suffering"" endured by thousands of women forced into sex during World War II. It even vowed to include the comfort women issue in new junior high school textbooks for the first time. Can 'womenomics' save Japan?

"(CNN) -- Seven people were injured when two freight trains collided early Saturday morning at a rail intersection in southeast Missouri, causing a highway overpass to collapse, authorities said. The accident occurred when a Union Pacific train T-boned a Burlington Northern Santa Fe train outside of Scott City, about 120 miles south of St. Louis, Scott County Sheriff Rick Walters said. One of the trains derailed, sending rail cars smashing into an overpass support pillar, he said. There were no cars on the overpass when it collapsed, but two cars drove into the collapsed structure in the dark, said Trooper Clark Parrott, spokesman for the Missouri State Highway Patrol. Five of the injured were in the cars, and two on the train. All but one of the injured were treated and released from the hospital, authorities said. Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board arrived at the crash scene by midday and were trying to determine what caused the accident. In the dark, Christopher Cantrell, 22, didn't see the collapsed bridge until it was too late. His car went airborne and crashed, he told CNN affiliate KFVS. Cantrell suffered minor injuries. His 19-year-old wife, Victoria, suffered a broken leg and a broken ankle, he said.

"(CNN) -- It's something the world's two leading female tennis players have in common, and it's not the grand slam titles both Wimbledon top seed Maria Sharapova and No. 2 Victoria Azarenka have to their names. Both stars have earned reputations as grunters, with Sharapova's screams puncturing the usual calm of London's All England Club on day one of the annual grass-court grand slam. But tennis' rule makers have set in motion a chain of actions which could make baseline bellows a thing of the past, including the introduction of a device to monitor on-court noise levels and possible steps to sanction excessive shouts. Death of a tennis art: Is this the end for serve and volley? ""The WTA, ITF, and grand slams aim to drive excessive grunting out of the game, while ensuring that we do not drive our current generation of players -- who were taught to play this way -- out of the game,"" read a WTA statement. ""This is a start of a sport-wide plan responsibly dealing with the issue through player education and objective rule changes."" While the body which governs women's tennis is eager to eradicate unnecessary shrieks, the organization is also cautious of negatively impacting current stars whose games have developed in a certain manner. ""It's time for us to drive excessive grunting out of the game for future generations,"" WTA CEO Stacey Allaster told USA Today. ""What is clear from experts is that it would have a clear, damaging effect on performance of the existing generation. ""It's going to take some time. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves because it's a collective effort of the sport and we need everyone to buy in."" Allaster said significant research needs to be conducted before any rule on noise could be formally introduced, and she stopped short of describing the device, which is still in development, as a ""grunt-o-meter."" ""The bottom line is that we want to bring forward across all levels of competition an objective rule through use of technology to make it much easier for athletes and chair umpires,"" she said. ""What is too loud? What is too long? We need to give the official an objective measurement tool. ""Can you imagine on a critical point an umpire going, 'Oh, I thought you were too loud.' You have to take all of that out of the equation. It's not fair to athletes, the chair or the sport.""","The sound of grunting is common in women's tennis .

"(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton says it would be ""spectacular"" if his new Mercedes team were able to compete when the 2013 Formula One season begins in March, but the 2008 world champion is not expecting to challenge at the front of the grid. Hamilton ended a career-long association with McLaren to sign a three-year deal with Mercedes in September. Despite competing for race wins in each of his six seasons with McLaren, the Briton accepts that his new team are some way behind the pace set by his former employers and Ferrari and Red Bull. ""I think it's important to be patient and realistic,"" the 28-year-old was quoted as saying on Formula One's official website. ""You've got to remember that the way Formula One has gone over the years, with the car evolving each year and how long it takes to find one second throughout the season. ""Mercedes were 1.1 seconds behind in Brazil... it's going to be very difficult for them in three months to gain two seconds. So I've just got to be wary of that, but I know that the guys are working as hard as they can and every little bit counts. ""This is a marathon, not a sprint. It's looking like the long haul. I hope that this year that we can be competitive. If we arrive at the first race and we are at the front it's going to be spectacular, but if we're not, then we just have to keep on working at it."" Hamilton endured a frustrating 2012 campaign with five race retirements denting his title challenge, eventually having to settle for a fourth-place finish in the drivers' championship. The Briton is willing to display similar patience with his new team. ""You've got to remember I had a couple of half-dodgy cars in the past, one in particular in 2009, but it did get better,"" he continued. ""Perseverance is going to be key for all of us. ""There is a great spirit -- just as there was in my previous team -- and the guys seem hungrier than any group of people I've seen before. They seem seriously hungry to win and excited that they have another shot of it again this year."" Hamilton is looking forward to getting behind the wheel of his new car during preseason testing in Jerez, Spain next month, before making his grand prix debut in Australia in March. ""Hopefully in those first days I'll have quite a good impact because I'll be able to compare one car to the other and say what we do and don't have,"" he said. ""I'll be able to say how the car is and how it could be better. But it'll take some time to dial in and get up to speed because they've got different controls on the steering wheel, different settings, a different set-up, and different characteristics of aero balance. ""I don't know how long it'll take for me to dial those in but I'm on top of it and I'm ready to get going.""","Lewis Hamilton is not expecting Mercedes to challenge immediately .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods first won on the PGA Tour until he was 20, and world No. 1 Rory McIlroy was 19 when he managed a European Tour success. Neither can rival the prodigious Lydia Ko, a New Zealand golfer on a record-breaking rise. Ko's three-shot victory at the Canadian Women's Open, four months and two days after her 15th birthday, made her the youngest winner in LPGA Tour history, and the first amateur to win on the U.S. circuit since JoAnne Carter in 1969. It has been a stellar year for the South Korea-born teen, with her record-breaking success coming two weeks after her triumph at the U.S. Amateur Championship and seven months after she became the youngest woman to win a pro tournament at the New South Wales Open. ""It feels amazing,"" she told New Zealand Golf's official website after Sunday's landmark win, capped off with a final five-under-par round of 67. ""I broke the youngest record in January for the New South Wales Open and to break another record or being in the history books, it's amazing, and it's always awesome to be able to play with the pros. ""So I never knew I had it coming, and I was so happy to win the U.S. Amateur, to win this. I never think about it, I just wanted to make the cut. ""And when I saw that I was tied first after the second day, I was like, wow. I'm feeling really good. And yeah, kind of surprised to have two wins in such a short time."" The tournament at the Vancouver Golf Club came with a $300,000 check for the winner, but Ko will not see a cent of it. While her amateur status may be detrimental to her bank balance, some seasoned observers are advising she stays among the amateur ranks for a little longer yet. ""In the end it was a pretty comfortable win for a player who is new to this level and competing with the top 48 out of 50 money winners on the LPGA Tour,"" said New Zealand golfing legend Bob Charles, who won the 1963 British Open. ""I understand that she has expressed interest in going to college here in the States at Stanford. She has obviously shown that she is good enough but I think she would benefit from a few more years as an amateur. I am pleased to hear that she wants to stay amateur for a few more years and that she intends to get an education behind her. ""While she has endless possibilities with her golf game, you never know what is going to happen and I encourage any young player to keep up the study while they are playing golf to help with other options later in life."" Ko echoed the views of Charles, while stressing she was keen to not forget the amateur scene which has helped her become one of the world's most exciting young golfers. The teenager is also helped by a wealthy benefactor. Octogenarian David Levene donated some of his $220 million fortune to Ko earlier this year, which meant she could retain her amateur status and continue with her education. ""I'll still remain an amateur and then finish high school and then go to college in the States,"" Ko said on the LGPA's official website. ""I mean this is a great win, but I don't think this will affect me changing my roots to my career."" New Zealand Golf chief executive Dean Murphy hailed Ko's triumph as a landmark day in the history of the sport in the country. ""She has delivered one of the great days in New Zealand golf history,"" said Murphy. ""Lydia has beaten a field of world-class professionals at the age of 15. ""It is not only a standout achievement in the history of New Zealand golf but also in the annals of New Zealand sport. Perhaps the most exciting thing with Lydia is, the best is yet to come."" The Auckland-based Ko, who has rocketed 140 places up the world rankings to 45th, will now turn her attention to the British Open -- which begins on September 13. After finishing tied for 39th at July's U.S. Open, her first major, many will be expecting Ko to carry her current form into one of the sport's four marquee events. Ko is being backed to succeed by one of her Kiwi forerunners, Marnie McGuire, who managed three third-place finishes -- one outright and two tied -- during her LPGA career. ""She will have more opportunities and obligations than she can possibly fulfill,"" said the 43-year-old, who turned pro in 1992 after graduating from Oklahoma State University and established herself in Japan before returning to the U.S. ""She needs to make sure she keeps the enjoyment in her game because that is one of the things that has made her successful. ""Yes she has missed out on the $300,000 but it is never about the money. She will be well supported for the rest of her life. It is never about the money though. It is about the achievement of winning and in Lydia's case creating history.""","Lydia Ko became the youngest ever LPGA Tour winner on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- She was getting out of the car one autumn day in 2009, about to have lunch with a colleague, when Este Osofsky-McGonigle felt something pop in her neck. ""It was something so strong I couldn't talk for a couple of minutes,"" recalls the New York school psychologist. But it passed, and she regained her speech. The rest of the day and night elapsed normally, but at 9:30 the next morning, as Osofsky-McGonigle finished up a meeting at work, her right arm went numb. She went into her office and tried to write a letter, ""Dear So-and-So."" But when she picked up the pen and tried to write the letter ""D,"" the pen just slid across the paper. Osofsky-McGonigle tried again, but the same thing happened. ""The 'D' went crazy,"" she said. Fortunately, Osofsky-McGonigle could still run -- and she did, running the whole length of the school building, seeking a friend who sent her to the school nurse. The nurse checked for a pulse in Osofsky-McGonigle's right arm, but found none. By the time she reached the hospital 15 minutes later, she could not lift her right arm or leg, speak or understand words. Osofsky-McGonigle, at 47 and in near-perfect health, was having a stroke. What happens during a stroke . The ""pop"" she felt in her neck the day before was her carotid artery tearing, a rare event called a carotid dissection. The carotid artery is the main artery supplying blood to the brain. A blood clot formed after the dissection, and a piece of it likely broke off and traveled into an artery in her brain, blocking blood supply and resulting in an ischemic stroke, explained Dr. Daniel Antoniello, the attending neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center who treated Osofsky-McGonigle. Ischemic stroke, which results from a blocked blood vessel, is the most common type of stroke and represents about 87% of all strokes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hemorrhagic strokes, which involve bleeds in the brain, make up the remainder. Most of the 800,000 strokes that occur in the United States each year occur among people age 65 and older, the CDC says. Unfortunately, doctors are seeing more and more strokes in younger people, partly because of the continuing epidemic of childhood obesity, early onset diabetes and cholesterol and hypertension issues, said Antoniello. No one knows why Osofsky-McGonigle's artery tore, especially at such a young age. She had not suffered a recent injury, nor did she have any traditional risk factors for vascular disease such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure. She may have simply been unlucky -- but after that, she was as lucky as any stroke survivor could be. Timing is the main factor determining whether a person lives or dies -- or lives with a severe disability -- after a stroke. May is National Stroke Awareness Month. Thanks to the alert school nurse, Osofsky-McGonigle made it to the emergency room about an hour and 20 minutes after her first symptoms. That left doctors plenty of time to administer the only approved treatment for ischemic stroke -- a clot-busting drug known as tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA. Generally speaking, tPA is only effective and only given within a 4.5-hour time window after stroke symptoms appear, said Antoniello. About an hour after that, Osofsky-McGonigle underwent a procedure in which doctors threaded a catheter through an artery in her groin all the way up into her brain. Once the catheter reached the clot, doctors squirted more tPA directly into the clot. Stroke victims don't call 911, delay crucial treatment . ""That dissolved the clot and restored blood flow,"" Antoniello said. Still, no one knew how well Osofsky-McGonigle would recover. After the procedure, she was in intensive care. The next day, she still couldn't speak or understand anything. On the second day, when Antoniello asked her to name some simple objects in her hospital room -- a pen, glasses, a watch -- she could not utter the words. ""She would try, but a jumbled mess would come out,"" he said. Osofsky-McGonigle had aphasia, a common outcome of stroke in which parts of the brain related to language, including reading, writing and talking, are damaged. Although some people experience a full recovery from aphasia, others only get part of their previous abilities back. How well a person recovers from stroke is highly variable and highly individual, Antoniello said. By the third day, though, Osofsky-McGonigle, who was also starting to move her right arm and leg, could name one or two simple items -- and her recovery took off from there. She was moved to a rehabilitation facility. At first, she made mistakes identifying family and friends, but soon could state who everyone was. ""That was a big promotion for me,"" she said. As soon as she got home, she said, she was bossing her husband, Ray, and son Zachary around. ""I said, 'Zachary, get the radio off,' but it was the TV I was talking about, so he said, 'It's the TV, not the radio.' I said, 'OK, get the TV off.' Osofsky-McGonigle started driving again and went back to work in early December 2009, a mere five weeks after her stroke. By any standard, she experienced an astounding recovery. ""It is absolutely remarkable that someone like her had such a severe impairment and then went back to work as a psychologist two months later,"" Antoniello said. ""There are not many people that make recoveries like her."" Once blood flow was restored, the damaged parts of Osofsky-McGonigle's brain started to ""come back on board,"" he said. Later on, different parts of her brain may have rewired for any areas that were permanently damaged. Today, she shows no evidence of a speech impairment. She attributes much of her recovery to determination. ""I couldn't afford to deteriorate,"" she said. ""I had a lot of things in my life lined up and I couldn't afford to be in any way less than what I was.""

"(CNN) -- Formula One's governing body is taking the unusual step of rewriting its own rulebook in the middle of the season in an attempt to end the tire crisis threatening to undermine the sport. The FIA has acted quickly by deciding to amend two rules which ban race drivers testing and prevent tires being changed during the season. The drivers and teams had called for urgent action after a series of dramatic tire blow-outs compromised driver safety at the British Grand Prix Sunday. Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton, who lost the race lead when his left-rear tire unravelled on lap eight, the Ferraris of Felipe Massa and Fernando Alonso, Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne, McLaren's Sergio Perez and Sauber's Esteban Gutierrez were all affected by tires failures. In response to the chaotic scenes at Silverstone, the FIA has proposed that race drivers take part in a tire development test at the British circuit on July 17-19. The test had originally been set aside for the teams to trial their young drivers, who are now set to miss out on a rare opportunity to drive an F1 car. ""Our priority is to ensure safety for all in Formula One and we believe the incidents at Silverstone represent a genuine safety concern for the drivers,"" said FIA President Jean Todt. ""We have thus taken the decision to alter the Young Driver Test in a bid to solve the problems we saw at the British Grand Prix. I believe it is fitting to carry out this work at the circuit upon which the issues were manifested."" The FIA's World Motorsport Council now has to give the green light to the rule changes, but that is expected to be a formality. F1's sole tire supplier Pirelli is due to announce its response to the chaos at the British GP later on Tuesday. The Italian manufacturer said at Silverstone it had been looking forward to focusing on the racing after being reprimanded at an FIA hearing for organizing a three-day tire test with Mercedes in May -- but instead Pirelli has found itself once again the center of unwanted attention. Mercedes -- who were also reprimanded by the FIA for using race drivers Hamilton and Nico Rosberg and a 2013 car at the controversial Barcelona tire test -- have decided to sit out the Silverstone test for the sake of harmony within the sport. The German team's ""secret"" test still riles their rivals -- especially as they have since won races in Monaco and Britain -- but the shocking tire explosions at the British GP have underlined the need for Pirelli to find a legitimate solution to the tire failures. Pirelli had wanted to introduce a new tire construction at the Canadian Grand Prix in June but failed to get all the teams to agree to the plan at a meeting in Monaco. A spate of worryingly delaminations -- where the tire layers separate -- earlier in the season had led to concerns the tires were not safe. When Pirelli took over from Bridgestone as F1's official tire supplier in 2011, the rubber was deliberately designed to be less durable so that teams would do more pit stops and the racing would be more unpredictable. But subsequent changes to the construction of the 2013 tire, based on the same principles, have now provoked not just unpredictability but chaos on the track.","Formula One to change rules on in-season testing and tire changes .

"(CNN) -- Italy's Matteo Manassero became the youngest ever winner at the PGA Championship. He had to work hard for it. Manassero edged England's Simon Khan on the fourth extra hole of a playoff after Scotland's Marc Warren exited on the first extra hole. The trio had finished at 10-under 278. Khan found the water with his second shot on the deciding hole in fading light at Wentworth, and when Manassero struck a birdie to clinch victory, he surpassed Bernard Gallacher as the youngest champion. At 20 years and 37 days, Manassero was two months younger than Gallacher when the Scot triumphed in 1969. As a result of winning the European Tour's flagship event, he'll move from No. 57 to inside the top 30 in the world rankings, leads the Race to Dubai and booked a spot at this year's U.S. Open. ""I feel unbelievable, really emotional,"" Manassero was quoted as saying by the European Tour's Web site. ""It's been an amazing week. I have always felt something really special about this place and this tournament. ""Everything has come together this week. I managed to play well and managed to stay in contention after a tough day on Friday and pulled it off with this playoff."" The dramatic finish at Wentworth helped make up for the early departures of Rory McIlroy, the world's second ranked golfer, and defending champion Luke Donald. Both missed the cut after underwhelming in the opening two rounds -- played in chilly conditions. The fans at Wentworth couldn't lift Ryder Cup stalwart Lee Westwood to victory, either. He was only a shot behind overnight leader Alejandro Canizares. Westwood, who recently moved his family from England to Florida, led at one stage on the front nine but was undone by a double bogey and two bogeys on the back nine. He finished the fourth round at one-over 73. He was bidding to better two runner-up finishes at Wentworth. ""Obviously Lee had the most support at the beginning, but I had so much -- the crowd in general this week has been unbelievable, really,"" Manassero added. ""I think the weekend that they got to see was a reward for the people that were here Friday with that weather to watch."" Manassero and Warren had chances to win the title before the playoff but faltered. Khan, five shots off the pace going into the final round, made a charge with a 66. When Khan won the PGA Championship in 2010, he rallied from a seven shot deficit in the final round with another 66. He was playing his first event since March due to his wife's illness, the European Tour's Web site reported. ""I wanted to prove to myself I've got it in me and that's been the great thing today,"" Khan was quoted as saying. ""I've played great. After such a long layoff, to come back and lose in a playoff of this fantastic tournament, I can take a lot out of it definitely. ""I felt great going into the playoff. It's just a shame that second shot (on the fourth extra hole) didn't carry another couple of yards or I would probably be going back out to 18 again."" Canizares and Miguel Angel Jimenez, the oldest man in the tournament at 49, finished a shot off the pace. British Open champion Ernie Els tied for sixth following a final round 67, while Sergio Garcia, under fire last week for ""fried chicken"" jibe, ended up tied for 19th.","Italy's Matteo Manassero, at 20, becomes the youngest winner of the PGA Championship .

"(CNN) -- At least 14 people were killed in 48 hours in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, including the Tuesday deaths of a municipal police officer and a newspaper vendor who police believe was targeted because of her job. In a statement Tuesday, federal police said they believed the female newspaper vendor was targeted by an area gang because she was seen as a threat to the gang's control of street vendors. ""La Linea thought she was discriminating against newspaper vendors they were extorting,"" municipal police spokesman Adrian Sanchez said. The woman, identified as Maribel Hernandez, distributed the El Diario de Juarez newspaper, the most widely circulated paper in the city. Police said they had arrested a suspect who told them he was paid about $250 for the killing. Also Tuesday, municipal police officer Ciro Puga Cruz, 39, was killed after armed gunmen shot him 15 times at a crowded intersection while his car stopped at a red light. The killing happened in front of dozens of people and caused panic, said journalist Arturo Chacon who was at the scene. The brazen shooting occurred after the officer left the police station at the end of his shift, Sanchez said. The shooters fled the scene and are still at large, police said. More than 100 police officers were killed in 2010, 67 of which were municipal, according to Sanchez.","Police: A newspaper vendor is targeted by an area gang in turf war .

"(CNN) -- Last week, members of the House of Representatives turned their attention to the biggest Obama scandal yet. No, I do not mean the IRS or Benghazi. Those are more partisan witch hunt than true scandal, a point backed up by recent CNN polling that shows independents and moderates trust the White House's take. I also do not mean the investigations of The Associated Press or Fox News reporter James Rosen. Both are worrying cases of the national security state trumping freedom of the press, but neither appear to have made it to the president's desk. And I hate to break it to the many fans of the hit TV show ""Scandal,"" but that is not what I am referring to, either. This is the real scandal: President Obama said in his second inaugural address that failing to act on climate change would ""betray future generations."" Now, many expect that he is ready to do exactly that by approving the Keystone XL pipeline. Last week, the pro-Keystone House of Representatives voted to take the decision out of Obama's hands. It may be unnecessary. In fact, Organizing for Action -- the Obama campaign organization that speaks for the president through his Facebook and Twitter accounts -- recently told activists that because the president has not taken a position on the pipeline, they should take their advocacy elsewhere. Even more scandalous: The White House appears to be basing its decision on myths. Keystone XL is not just another pipeline moving ""oil."" It would carry chemically treated tar sands. A few years ago this tar leaked into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan. Three years and $1 billion later, the Kalamazoo may never come back. Tar sands is not traditional oil. It is a pipe-eating, planet-cooking, water-fouling goo that nobody knows how to get out of our water. Keystone will not make us energy independent. The foreign company behind the pipeline, TransCanada, itself admits that the pipeline is key to getting tar sands to the world market. The company made no promises to sell any of that oil to the United States. The Keystone XL pipeline will bring dirty fuel through America, not to America. As for the jobs we were promised, the president's own State Department says Keystone will create only 35 permanent jobs. If President Obama buys these myths, he should embrace this project publicly. He should call it the ""Obama Tar Sands Pipeline."" He should show up at the ribbon cutting. If he refuses to do that and still approves Keystone XL, the first thing that pipeline will run over is his credibility on climate. Now, that is a scandal. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Van Jones.","Van Jones: Obama might OK Keystone pipeline, betraying his environmental vows .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel recovered from a nightmare start to become the youngest ever triple Formula One champion as Jenson Button won the Brazilian Grand Prix. The 25-year-old was hit on the fourth turn of the opening lap and suffered damage to the left side of his car which could not be fixed. But Vettel roared back through the field to finish sixth and deny title rival Fernando Alonso by three points with the Spaniard finishing the race in second place. 'Brazil suits Red Bull' insists Vettel . ""I feel very proud of my team and of the season we have had,"" said Alonso. ""We have lost the championship now, but not here in Brazil, instead in some other races (Belgium and Japan when he was involved in first corner accidents). ""When you do something 100% you have to happy and proud for the team, and we will try again next year."" It means that Vettel is only the third driver in the history of the sport to win three successive titles, equalling the achievements of Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher. Fangio vs. Senna: Who is the greatest? In a race which twisted and turned at every opportunity, it was no surprise that Vettel was made to sweat for his moment of glory. A slow start saw him drop to ninth before a coming together with Bruno Senna left his car damaged. With Red Bull unable to fix the problem and his title hopes sliding away, Vettel produced the drive of a champion, fighting his way from the back of the field to keep the pressure on Alonso. All the pressure on Vettel claims Alonso . While Alonso sat further ahead with hopes of a third world title beginning to surface, the rain began to fall, leaving the drivers at the mercy of the elements. Vettel was forced to pit no less than three times as the weather continued to change, while Lewis Hamilton's hopes of winning on his final race for McLaren were cruelly dashed. The 2008 world champion, who will race for Mercedes next year, collided with Nico Hulkenberg and suffered a broken front-left suspension. While he was applauded all the way back to the paddock by his McLaren team, it was Button who took full advantage. As the Briton remained untroubled as leader of the race, Vettel was still battling to get past Schumacher and claim the sixth place finish he needed to claim the title. Seven-time winner Schumacher finished a creditable seventh on his final race before retirement, but it was the action further up the track which was catching the eye. Alonso passed Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa to move into second, but with a few laps remaining, Vettel finally passed his fellow countryman to secure the title. Final Brazilian GP top 10 . 1.

"(CNN) -- Mercedes occupied their usual position at the top of the practice time sheets Friday as Nico Rosberg recorded the quickest lap head of this weekend's British Grand Prix. The 28-year-old German, who won the Monaco Grand Prix earlier this season from pole, edged out the Red Bull pair of Mark Webber and three-time defending champion Sebastian Vettel in the second session at Silverstone. His Mercedes teammate and crowd favorite Lewis Hamilton claimed the fifth best time in drying conditions after morning rain had rendered the first runs largely irrelevant. Fellow Briton Paul Di Resta was fourth for Force India. Rosberg's time of one minute 32.248 seconds edged out Webber, who earlier this week announced he would be quitting Red Bull and F1 at the end of the season. Webber has claimed podium positions in his last four races on the track and once again showed his liking for its high speed straights and corners. But Rosberg, who has headed the grid in three of the last four races, proved unstoppable again in the early sparring although he has some concerns for the weekend. ""Then the only question mark is our race speed. We practised for the race speed today. It seemed to be OK, decent, but I'm sure it's still going to be a little bit of a problem for us,"" he told AFP. ""The next thing is that it's going to be another 10 degrees more tomorrow and Sunday and that could completely change the picture again."" Vettel's nearest challengers in this year's title race, Ferrari's Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen for Lotus were were 10th and 13th respectively. Alonso's teammate Felipe Massa again crashed out, damaging his front suspension, and ended with the 22nd fastest time. 2009 world champion and another home favorite, Jenson Button, was 11th best for the struggling McLaren outfit.

"(CNN) -- Kevin Ware's leg may be broken but not his spirit. Not in the least bit. Millions of television viewers cringed, when a bone punched through Ware's skin, protruding out of his leg after the University of Louisville guard landed hard from a jump to block a shot Sunday night. It brought the Elite Eight game against the Duke Blue Devils to a screeching halt in the first half. ""I kind of joke a little bit,"" Ware said. ""Like I should have blocked the shot because I jumped so high, but I guess I just landed wrong and didn't see where I was landing, so that's kind of what caused the injury."" Ware has taken a peek at the replay, but turned away from the screen, he told CNN on Wednesday. It's about keeping his attitude upbeat for his team. Ware: 'I honestly never want to see the video' of broken leg . ""I honestly never want to see the video,"" he said. ""It puts me in a mental state that I don't want to be. That would just stop me from being where I need to be, especially if I feel I want to be successful with basketball."" And while his teammates were horrified at the gruesome injury, Ware said it was divine providence. ""This is all God. This is all God's plan. He would never let anything happen that He wouldn't want to happen,"" he said. Ware was taken to hospital to repair the ugly break. Louisville beat Duke by 22 points, while he was in surgery, to win the region for the Cardinals. He hopes he may have inspired the victory. A photo posted on the Internet shows Ware's jubilant teammates holding up his jersey as they celebrated their win over Duke. It netted them the NCAA championship trophy for their region and propelled them to the tournament's Final Four in Atlanta this weekend. Louisville player, injured badly on Sunday, out of hospital . Serendipity? The mishap triggered a heaping dose of well wishes. Ware got a phone call from first lady Michelle Obama. He is unable to remember the conversation, because he was still heavily sedated. ""Please, please call again,"" he implored the first lady in the CNN interview. ""It's a once in a lifetime thing."" A Facebook fan page popped up Sunday and has filled with nearly 80,000 fans. It sported photos and well wishes documenting his journey from injury to surgery and beyond, and includes a photo of him in his hospital bed holding the NCAA regional trophy his team won in the game he was injured in. Ware has been touched by the public support. ""I'm a very quiet guy, so a lot of this is really new to me, you know,"" Ware said. ""I really just appreciate everybody and the support I have right now. The NCAA regional trophy was lying in his bed while he was still unconscious. It was the first thing he woke up to. ""It was like Christmas, but basketball Christmas,"" he said. Moment of shock . When Ware first crashed down onto the court's boards, his mother Lisa ""just lost it,"" she said. ""It really did look that bad,"" she told CNN. Ware called his mother from the emergency room to put her mind at ease. ""The first thing he said was, 'Mom, calm down, I'm OK,'"" she said. Ware intends to return the court. The broken leg, held together by two metal plates, will heal in eight to 12 weeks, he said. ""I will play basketball again,"" Ware said. ""I know patience is key."" Ware could be playing again in less than a year . Team rallies around him . Earlier Wednesday, Ware recounted at a news conference his distress the moment his leg broke and immediate support from his teammates. He said he was surprised to see some of them crying. ""Everybody was in real shock, and just looking around and seeing that, it was devastating,"" said Ware, who was using crutches Wednesday. ""But they pulled it through, and that's really most important right now,"" Ware said. The injured player looked down at his body. It changed his state of mind. ""I see my bone is 6 inches out of my leg, and I go into automatic shock,"" he told reporters at a news conference. His foot was dangling off of his shin like a limp rag. Faith and inspiration . Teammate Luke Hancock came over to Ware as he lay on the floor and said a prayer for him. Ware said to himself that ""I'm either going to cry ... or I'm just going to try to say some words (to help the team)."" He thought of his team and put the pain behind him. In a two-hour surgery, Ware's broken tibia was straightened and a rod was inserted into it, according to a statement from Kenneth Klein, senior associate athletic director for media relations at the university. For the team and victory . In spite of the pain and the road to recovery ahead, Ware is still thinking of his team, not himself. ""I'll be fine, but (we've) still got to win this championship,"" he said. Mr. Inspiration is ready for the Final Four, where his team is two games away from a potential national championship. He has already made his way to Atlanta to cheer the Cardinals on in person. During his interview with CNN, he and his mother donned T-shirts with the words ""Win it for Kevin.""

"(CNN) -- Not long ago, it was virtually guaranteed that the ""Big Four"" of men's tennis would grace the semifinals of every major tournament. But times are changing -- while fans had hoped Roger Federer might make it as far as the last eight in China this week for a tantalizing clash with Novak Djokovic, it was not to be. The former world No. 1 said he had been energized by the response to his first appearance since September's U.S. Open after Wednesday's win over Andreas Seppi, but he was stopped in his tracks 24 hours later. Federer, now ranked seventh and battling for a place in the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals for the 12th successive year, was beaten 6-4 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 by former world No. 7 Gael Monfils at the Shanghai Masters. Blog: When should Federer retire? As a semifinalist last year, the 32-year-old will lose points in the race for the eight places in London. The 17-time grand slam champion went straight back out on court to play alongside China's Zhang Ze in the doubles -- a rare foray in the format for the Swiss -- and suffered another defeat as they went down 6-1 1-6 10-8 against Ivan Dodig and Marcelo Melo. Defending champion Djokovic, meanwhile, booked his place in the quarterfinals with a 6-3 6-3 win over Italy's Fabio Fognini. He will face a Frenchman who beat Federer for just the second time in eight career meetings, but has a 0-8 record against Djokovic. Monfils, now ranked 42nd after resuming his career this year following an injury-plagued 2012 season, had led 5-3 in the second set and also 5-3 in the tie-break but admitted nerves got to him. ""I knew that I choked on this forehand at 5-4,"" the 27-year-old said. ""Then I changed my ideas because I was maybe nervous, too. Even though I was tired, I tried to play more aggressively sometimes, going more for my shots and it worked. ""It's a good win for me. I feel a bit sorry for him because I know he's running for London. But it's tennis. He's going to have more opportunity those weeks coming up."" World No. 1 Rafael Nadal, who is assured a place at the London finals, moved into the Shanghai quarterfinals with a 6-1 7-6 (7-5) victory over Carlos Berlocq on Thursday. The Spaniard will next face Federer's eighth-ranked compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka, who won 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 against another finals hopeful, Canada's No. 11 Milos Raonic. With the other member of the game's leading quartet, Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, already ruled out of his home showpiece event next month due to injury, it would be a massive blow for organizers if Federer is also absent. Federer has two tournaments left in which to qualify -- his home Swiss Indoors and the Paris Masters. He was the losing finalist in Basel last year, but skipped the French event so can potentially gain points there. ""He's still strong,"" Monfils said. ""It's just a matter of confidence, I think. I have no doubt that he will get back to the way people expect him to be."" Spanish third seed David Ferrer also crashed out in Shanghai, losing 6-4 6-3 to Florian Mayer -- becoming the German's first top-10 scalp this year. Fourth-ranked Ferrer, who has already qualified for next month's season finale, dropped to a 50-18 record this year. Mayer, meanwhile, will next face French seventh seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who kept alive his hopes of qualifying for London by beating Japan's Kei Nishikori 7-6 (7-5) 6-0. Sixth seed Juan Martin del Potro walked into the quarterfinals when German veteran Tommy Haas pulled out of their clash with a back problem. The Argentine, fifth in the points standings, will next face Spain's Nicolas Almagro -- who dented Tomas Berdych's hopes of clinching a London berth by beating the sixth-ranked Czech 6-7 (6-8) 6-3 7-6 (7-4) in two hours and 37 minutes.","Roger Federer loses to Gael Monfils in third round of the Shanghai Masters .

"(CNN)  -- The stadium lights are on, the outfield is mowed, and the beer taps are primed for their first pour. The Major League Baseball regular season is about to begin. It's so close, you can taste it -- and it's not all peanuts and Cracker Jacks. Each of the 30 teams in the league has a clubhouse chef fueling the players, preparing meals for the home and away teams during the season. Jeremy Bryant, 37, who describes himself as a die-hard Seattle Mariners fan and ""the one starting the wave,"" is the clubhouse chef for the Mariners. But the way he got the gig required a few extra practice swings. More than a decade ago, Bryant and a few buddies made their way to the clubhouse after the game to seek out players' autographs. What he found instead was a revolting spread of food. ""No way, I couldn't believe my heroes were eating food like this,"" recalled Bryant, a graduate of the Culinary Arts Program at South Seattle Community College. As he quickly found out, fans weren't technically allowed into the clubhouse without proper credentials. As Bryant was escorted out, he passed Scott Gilbert, the clubhouse manager, and took his shot, handing Gilbert his business card. Bryant never heard from him. Taking matters into his own hands, he started coming down to the stadium to bring the team food. He kept coming back ... and back ... and back. ""If you leave me alone, I'll let you cook dinner,"" Gilbert finally told Bryant right before the demolition of the old Kingdome stadium. It was finally the young chef's turn to step up to the plate. He maxed out his credit card, preparing steak and lobster and even bringing out an ice sculpture. After that dinner, the Mariners hired Bryant. He's now in his 11th season and watches every home game at Safeco Field on an 8-inch television in the clubhouse kitchen. Bryant cooks not only for the big hitters but for the umpires, the wives and the kids, usually 60 to 70 people a game. His off-season catering company, New Century Catering, cooks for the visiting teams at Safeco Field. Albeit a chef, Bryant is first and foremost a fan. And like any devoted baseball enthusiast, Bryant doesn't dismiss the superstitions that have long intertwined with the national pastime. There's the Curse of the Bambino and those players who don't step on the foul line on the way to bat, but have you heard the one about Ichiro Suzuki and the wings? Suzuki, a native of Japan, came to play for the Mariners in 2001. In an effort to bring the cuisine of Japan to the home field, Bryant served Japanese chicken wings to the player on one of his first days. Suzuki went on to have an incredible year, ultimately being named Most Valuable Player. Suzuki now eats those wings at 5:05 p.m., on the same plate, from the same pan, every single game. Ken Griffey Jr. fancies a nice juicy steak, and Jose Lopez prefers fettucine alfredo -- that is, until the nutritionist came along two years ago, forcing players to eat more healthily. Bryant's beloved deep fryer struck out, though he admits he occasionally trafficks a corn dog from the stadium for player who wishes to remain anonymous. When word spread that the first item blacklisted by the nutritionist was dark-meat chicken, Bryant's cell phone rang. It was one of the overlords at the Mariners: ""Ichiro gets 200 hits a year, so he eats whatever he wants."" For now, Suzuki still gets his plate of teriyaki wings at 5:05. (The Mariners open the season against the Oakland Athletics on April 5 at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum.)","Jeremy Bryant, a die-hard Mariners fan, also cooks for team .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A Beijing court sentenced Li Tianyi, the son of a famous Chinese ""singing general"" in the People's Liberation Army, to 10 years in jail on Thursday over a gang rape that unleashed public outrage at the behavior of China's ""princelings,"" or children of the political elite. The Haidian People's Court sentenced Li, 17, and four other defendants to jail terms ranging from three to 12 years over the gang rape of a woman in a hotel room in February. Li, also known as Li Guanfeng, denied the charges, telling the court he was drunk and could recall little of the night in question. He denied beating or having sex with the woman despite his four co-accused issuing guilty pleas by the trial's end, state media reported. Lawyers for the accused argued in pre-trial hearings that the woman was a prostitute, and the matter should be tried as a prostitution matter, rather than a rape case. In handing down the verdict, the court said the evidence was ""adequate"" to uphold the rape charges. Users on Chinese social media applauded the verdict, hailing it as a victory of justice over the infamous ""taizidang,"" or ""princelings,"" who are widely regarded as spoiled and corrupt. ""The bastard is finally charged. God finally works,"" wrote a user called @Jiaxinglantianxiadezhiai on the popular Chinese micro-blogging service Sina Weibo. However, others doubted that he would serve out his full sentence. ""After people stop closely watching this case, he will get out of jail immediately. It's always easy as long as you have money,"" posted one user called @Miya-Qiu. Li -- the son of a PLA celebrity officer known as the ""singing general"" for his televised renditions of patriotic anthems -- previously made headlines in 2011 when he attacked a family in a road rage incident, threatened bystanders and dared them to call police. The incident provoked an outcry when it came to light that he had 36 prior traffic violations for driving without a license. He was subsequently sent to a juvenile detention center for a year, and his father issued a public apology. Li's mother Meng Ge, who is also a celebrity singer in the PLA, also came under under fire on social media after she blamed society for her son's behavior. Public opinion has been mounting against the so-called princelings since an incident in 2010, when the drunk-driving 22-year-old son of a deputy provincial police chief fatally ran over a student and shouted: ""Sue me if you dare! My father is Li Gang!"" The phrase has since become synonymous with nepotism and corruption in China. President Xi Jinping has launched a high-profile anti-corruption campaign in response to public discontent with corrupt officials, publicly rebuking PLA musicians following a series of embarrassing reports detailing their privileged lifestyles and exposing incidents of commercial exploitation of their positions. The dressing down was accompanied by new measures, signed off by Xi and detailed in the PLA Daily, the official organ of China's armed forces, designed to curb the excesses of military musical troupes. Xi's wife, the noted soprano Peng Liyuan, herself served in a PLA performance troupe. CNN's Feng Ke contributed to this report.","Li Tianyi, 17, sentenced to 10 years in high-profile gang rape case .

"(CNN) -- Police closed a section of Interstate 90 in eastern New York on Saturday after a gunman opened fire at a state trooper after a traffic stop, authorities said. A law enforcement officer approaches the gunman Saturday along Interstate 90 in New York. A witness said the scene was ""chaos"" as drivers and passengers ducked to avoid the shots and attempted to flee. The incident occurred about 11:55 a.m. near the town of East Greenbush, just southeast of Albany, the New York State Police said in a statement. ""A large contingent of state police and East Greenbush PD responded to the area,"" the statement said. ""The traffic on I-90 was evacuated, and I-90 was closed down in both directions in Rensselaer County."" The gunman was shot and is in state police custody, authorities said. However, a section of I-90 between two exits, where the incident occurred, remained closed Saturday afternoon. The Albany Times Union reported on its Web site that the gunman was in a hospital, although it was unclear whether he was shot by police or turned the gun on himself. No officers were injured, the newspaper said. The gunman's condition was not immediately known. ""It was chaos,"" said witness Carol Winn, who said she was headed to Albany on I-90 ""when all of a sudden there was this big traffic jam in front of me.""  Watch scenes from Saturday's incident » . Winn said, ""I heard a shot fired, and then I thought maybe there was a deer in the road and someone had to shoot it to put it down. But then I heard more shots and saw people ducking down in their cars, and I knew something was wrong."" She said a trooper with his gun drawn walked beside her stopped car as she heard more shots. Along with other drivers, Winn fled the scene on foot. ""There was maybe 100 people running south on the northbound lane, and as we were running, we heard shots continuing to be fired,"" she said. Winn estimated that the shooting was taking place about 15 cars in front of her. ""I got in a car that was going south, and they got us to safety,"" she said. ""I never got a chance to look at the shooter, but someone else that fled with me said he saw someone get out of a taxi cab with a rifle."" Winn estimated hearing about 10 shots in all. Video footage shows the gunman standing outside what appears to be a taxi holding up a rifle as numerous police cars respond to the scene and other cars are stopped some distance away. A helicopter hovered overhead. Winn said Saturday afternoon that she was headed back to get her car, which was abandoned in the road, since that section of interstate had been reopened. ""I still have the keys in my hand, but I left my purse,"" she said. ""I didn't care about my purse. I just left it there and ran.""

"(CNN) -- Valentino Rossi snapped a near three-year victory drought in MotoGP by claiming the Dutch round at Assen Saturday, but said the real ""hero"" had been his Yamaha teammate Jorge Lorenzo who took a brave fifth with a broken collarbone. The defending world champion crashed at 200kph in practice earlier this week and underwent an operation in Barcelona early Friday on his injuries. Passed fit to race, he finished just behind fellow Spaniard and current title leader Dani Pedrosa to concede just two points in the overall standings, trailing him by nine after seven rounds. ""For me he is the hero of the day,"" Rossi told the official MotoGP website. ""When he told me he was going to ride, I thought there was no way he could. Two days after a terrible accident and such an operation is amazing."" But for the legendary Italian, it was also a welcome return to the top of the podium after two disappointing seasons with Ducati. ""I'm happy but I can't believe it and it's a great feeling to be back in first position,"" he admitted. ""It's been a long, long time since Sepang 2010 and during those years I've ask myself the question: 'Can I get back to first position?' ""But I've never given up and I've always worked hard because this is my passion. I love to ride and race motorcycles."" It was the nine-time world champion's 80th victory in MotoGP, the premier class of motorcycling, and pushes him up to fifth in the overall standings, but still 51 points adrift of Pedrosa. Marc Marquez of Spain finished second for Honda ahead Britain's Cal Clutchlow, who had claimed the first pole position of his career Friday. Marquez is third in the overall standings, 23 points adrift of teammate Pedrosa, after riding with injuries of his own. ""I am, happy with the result given that I have a fractured small finger on my right hand and a broken big toe,"" he said. But Marquez was unable to make much impression on Rossi, who took the checkered flag to a massive roar from the devoted motorcycling fans at one of the best attended races on the calendar.

"(CNN) -- Professional ballet dancer Michaela DePrince was just three years old when she saw a ballerina for the first time. She was standing near the gate of the orphanage she was living in the West African country of Sierra Leone when she found a magazine with a female ballet dancer on the cover. The image of the beautiful, smiling ballerina mesmerized the young orphan, who had just lost both of her parents. ""I was just so fascinated by this person, by how beautiful she was, how she was wearing such a beautiful costume,"" she remembers. ""So I ripped the cover off and I put it in my underwear."" At the time, DePrince -- or Mabinty Bangura as she was then called -- had no idea what ballet was. But she kept onto the picture, dreaming of one day becoming as happy as the ballerina on the magazine cover. ""It represented freedom, it represented hope, it represented trying to live a little longer,"" she recalls. ""I was so upset in the orphanage, I have no idea how I got through it but seeing that, it completely saved me."" Shortly after, DePrince was adopted by an American couple and began a new life in the United States. Today, at the age of 17, she is one of the ballet world's rising stars -- last month she traveled to South Africa to make her professional debut in Johannesburg. ""I worked very hard and I was en pointe by the time I was seven years old,"" says DePrince. ""I just moved along fast because I was so determined to be like that person on the magazine and she was what drove me to become a better dancer, a better person -- to be just like her was what I wanted to be."" Read related: Sierra Leone 'will become aid donor in next 50 years' Tens of thousands of people died during Sierra Leone's brutal civil war from 1991 to 2002. The horrors of the decade-long conflict defined DePrince's early memories: Her father was murdered by rebels while her mother starved to death shortly after. One of her uncles took her to an orphanage hoping she'd be adopted and taken to a safer place. But life in the orphanage was tough for the three-year-old girl. She remembers being called ""the devil's child"" and being ill-treated by the orphanage's carers because she had vitiligo -- a skin condition that causes blotches of lightening skin. Children in the orphanage were given numbers ranking them from the most favored to the least -- DePrince was ranked 27th out of 27 children. ""I didn't get enough food, I didn't get the best clothes, I got the last choice of toys,"" she says. ""I was in the back and they didn't really care if I died or whatever happened to me."" Hopelessness and despair engulfed DePrince even further when she witnessed the murder of one of her teachers at the orphanage, a pregnant woman ""who was the only person who actually took time to care for me,"" she says. ""She was going outside the gate and I was walking with her, I was going to say bye, and then these three rebels come -- two older and a younger one and they see that she's pregnant and what they used to do is if it was a boy, they would keep the baby, if it was a girl they would kill the mother and the baby,"" she says. ""So they cut her stomach and they saw that it was a girl, so then they were angry and they cut her arms and legs off and left her and the baby there. I was trying to save her and so I went underneath the gate and the little boy saw all these older people doing these things and I guess he wanted to impress them and thought it was funny, so he stabbed me and so I have actually a scar from it and it was a black out after that -- I have no idea how I survived that, it was awful."" Watch: Former child soldier speaks out . But DePrince's life changed once and for all in 1999 when at the age of four she was adopted by a couple from New Jersey. Passionate about dancing, she earned a full scholarship to the prestigious American Ballet Theater's summer intensive in New York aged 13. A year later she took part in the youth America Grand Prix, the biggest ballet competition in the world, where she walked with yet another scholarship. The teenage dancer also became the subject of ""First Position,"" an award-winning documentary about the competitive contest and performed on hit TV show ""Dancing with the Stars."" Graced with talent and strength, DePrince says she has had to work even harder to get accepted into the rarefied world of ballet dancing -- a predominantly white preserve. Read related: South African ballet dancer confounds racial stereotypes . She says she almost quit dancing when she was 10 years old after a teacher told her mother that she didn't want to put ""a lot of effort and money into the black dancers because they just get fat and get big boobs and big thighs."" But those words only served to make DePrince even more determined. ""I'm still trying to change the way people see black dancers, that we can become delicate dancers, that we can be a ballerina."" DePrince also says she'd like to start an art school in Sierra Leone. She wants to use her remarkable story to teach little girls on the continent that if they have a dream they can definitely achieve it. ""Even though you might have had a terrible past and even though you might have been through a lot and might be still going through a lot, if you have something that you love and that makes you happy and that gives you that feeling inside to continue growing up and that makes you want to have a good future then you should focus on that and not focus on the negative.""","Sierra Leonean ballet dancer Michaela DePrince lost both of her parents aged three .

"(CNN) -- Spain's Jorge Lorenzo was crowned MotoGP world champion Sunday after finishing second behind home favorite Casey Stoner in the Australian round at Phillip Island. The Yamaha star took full advantage of a mistake by his closest rival Dani Pedrosa, who came off on Turn Four of the first lap to see his title hopes disappear. Pedrosa's Honda teammate Stoner rode a peerless race to secure his sixth straight win on his home track, a fitting finale before his retirement at the end of the season. Lorenzo held off Britain's Cal Crutchlow (Monster Yamaha Tech 3) to clinch his second world title in motorcycling's premier class. ""What a day! I'm very happy, it was easier than I expected because Dani made a mistake in a corner and crashed. I wanted to keep with Casey but he was so strong,"" he told the MotoGP official website. ""Today is an amazing moment. We've been very patient and very concentrated,"" he added. He will go into the final race before his home fans in Valencia with a 43-point advantage over compatriot Pedrosa, who was philosophic after his first lap mistake. ""There is some sadness because we've been closer than ever to take the title, but also proud for all we achieved,"" he said. ""Concerning the crash, it was nothing strange, I just went wider on the corner lost the front, maybe the tire was not warm enough."" Stoner, who saw his hopes of defending the world title disappear after a crash at the U.S. round in Indianapolis, was delighted to have signed off in front of his loyal Australian supporters with another superb victory, the 45th of his glittering career. ""It was very important for me to win a race before the end of the season and I'm really happy to do it here, at home, in front of the huge crowd,"" he said. ""My condolences to Dani -- I saw him crash out in front of me - but he had to push today and go out and win the race to keep his championship hopes alive.""

"Editor's note: The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson Sr. is president and founder of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition. He began his theological studies at the Chicago Theological Seminary and deferred his studies when he began working full-time in the Civil Rights movement with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Rev. Jackson received his Master of Divinity degree in 2000. Next week: Rev. DeForest ""Buster"" Soaries Jr. writes about his campaign to eliminate debt as senior pastor of First Baptist Church of Lincoln Gardens in Somerset, New Jersey. He is featured in CNN's ""Almighty Debt: A Black in America Special"" which premieres October 21. My faith tradition has always been inextricably bound with the tradition of the civil rights movement. The blood, sweat and tears of ""the movement"" have run through my life; they touched and entangled me with an indelible spirit of never giving up, always trying to serve. Through the good and hard times, I lean on my faith to help me traverse the twists and turns of life. I grew up with two strong parents who believed in the literal sense and spirit of the Bible that required and mandates prayer in all circumstances. They prayed daily and instilled that belief in me. They were faithful to our local church. My parents participated in all aspects of the church work including tithing, which enabled us to build what we could with what we have and God's help. I learned very early in life ""with God all things are possible."" As I navigated through the south as a youth, and in particular a college student, I was thrust into the civil rights movement. Racism was alive and well in the segregated South, present in every facet of our lives. It was a ""dual society"" socially, where blacks could not sit at the same lunch counters as whites, sat at the back of the bus, and were denied equal access to public accommodations; and also economically, where African-Americans had little, if any, direct participation in the financial life of the nation. Seeing the inequities in all aspects of our lives greatly challenged me to seek another way, a better way. I learned through the teaching of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his contemporary Dr. Leon Sullivan that our plight as a people was like that of a symphony. I came to conceptualize our cause and termed it the ""Freedom Symphony"" -- our freedom song to democratic, economic empowerment. Symphonies are constructed in four movements. The first movement was the fight to end slavery -- a tumultuous upheaval battling the dehumanization of African Americans. Slavery fueled the global trade markets and the industrialization of America. It was an economic system that confined blacks to work without wages, and it involved total subjugation to the master. The second movement was our quest to dismantle Jim Crow and tear down ancient walls of legal segregation that prevented equal, democratic participation in America's social, political and economic life. But the legacy of decades of slavery and Jim Crow segregation left blacks in a state of inequality. Economic inequalities -- two Americas -- remained a fact of life. The third movement was our fight for the right to vote, to open the voting process to all African-Americans as well as create and institute new legislation such as the Voting Rights Act to ensure and protect the rights of all voters. Our fourth movement of the Freedom Symphony represents the unfinished business of our movement. We are free, but not equal. Our fight for economic justice, access to capital, industry and technology remains at the forefront of today's agenda. This fourth movement is one that I believe will take us beyond the margins so that all can participate in the prosperity of our nation. My last days with Dr. King and Dr. Sullivan were filled with watching them motivate and move our nation toward a more perfect union. We must be guided by their faith and spurred to social action to ensure that we have equal access to capital, unfettered economic development in urban communities and fair and equitable professional financial services which includes deal flow and fee structure. My faith inspires me to continue to do this work. But faith without works is dead. And so we tackle today's financial calamity - one that now finds us grappling with an ever spiraling cycle of unemployment, home foreclosures and rising student loan debt. It is here where faith and works meet. And it is upon this philosophy that I seek to serve my God and our world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson Sr.","Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. says faith must be accompanied by good works on earth .

"(CNN) -- Motorcycling star Casey Stoner may have announced his attention to retire from the sport on Thursday, but his apparent lack of motivation to continue racing was not apparent 24 hours later as he topped practice for this weekend's Le Mans Grand Prix. The two-time MotoGP world champion says he has grown tired of the discipline after five years competing in the elite division, and will bow out at the end of this season -- which still has 15 of the 18 races remaining . ""I will be finishing my career at the end of this season in MotoGP, and go forward in different things in my life,"" the 26-year-old Australian told a pre-practice news conference.

""There are a lot of things that have disappointed me, and also a lot of things I have loved about this sport, but unfortunately the balance has gone in the wrong direction."" The Honda rider leads the 2012 world championship after two wins from three races. ""It would be nice if I could say I would stay one more year,"" he said. ""But then where does it stop?

Seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi was well down the order in ninth, having struggled for form since switching from Yamaha to Ducati for the 2011 season. But despite his recent poor form, the legendary Italian dismissed rumors he was considering retirement and said he wanted to continue in the sport for at least another two seasons.

"(CNN) -- The debate over whether the hand-to-hand-combat excesses of Black Friday represent a grotesque over-commercialization of the holiday season has lost its meaning. The point is no longer whether or not Black Friday tarnishes the holidays. The point is that Black Friday has become a holiday of its own. It will arrive again this week, even as Americans are still sitting at their Thanksgiving dinner tables. Black Friday -- with its door-buster sales, hordes of frenzied shoppers shoving for position, employees nervously waiting for the onslaught -- has shrugged off the confines of its name and has now established squatters' rights on Thursday. Target stores will open at 9 p.m. Thanksgiving night, three hours earlier than the stores' midnight opening in 2011. Wal-Mart will begin its Black Friday sales at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving. Toys R Us will match that 8 p.m. opening, as will Sears. Best Buy, which will wait until midnight to open its doors, seems almost like a dowdy throwback. The store employees around the country who are upset that the schedules will deprive them of a big part of their holiday Thursday (many of them will have to arrive hours before the customers) and the citizens who fret that the lure of the deeply discounted sales will empty out their home-for-the-holidays family gatherings are probably fighting a losing battle. Black Friday appears to be triumphant, and it has taken on the characteristics of the holidays it mimics. Like real holidays, it occurs on a predesignated day each year. People anticipate it and mark the date. Across the breadth of the nation they are absent from work to observe it. And when the day arrives, they congregate like. . .well, like congregations. Established religious holidays, such as Christmas and Hanukkah, have long been occasions for gift-giving; some holidays -- Mother's Day, Father's Day, Valentine's Day -- have eagerly been embraced by merchants as a way to move their products. Black Friday does away with the middleman -- in the universe of holidays, it is the only one that exists solely to sell merchandise. It celebrates nothing; it commemorates only itself. It is an annual festival of the cash register. News: Retail employess fight ""Black Friday creep"" The derivation of the term ""Black Friday"" is open to dispute, but it has come to refer to the theory that merchants go into the black -- into the profit side of the ledger -- during the holiday shopping season, which traditionally commences the day after Thanksgiving. Certainly, and especially in this economy, anything that brings people into the stores is welcome. Brick-and-mortar stores can use the foot traffic as shopping goes increasingly online. And digital doors are open 24 hours a day, every day of the year. But there is something about Black Friday -- in the pandemonium of its execution -- that is unsettling and cynical. The Wal-Mart employee who was trampled to death on Long Island in 2008 as shoppers knocked the doors from their hinges and stepped on him in their rush to the stacks of sales items, the woman in California last year who unleashed pepper spray on fellow shoppers vying for Xbox video game consoles. . .those kinds of scenes are becoming the iconic images of the long night. Of course, the new holiday would not have taken hold if people weren't embracing it. But you have to ask yourself: When people, as they grow older, remember the best holidays of their lives, is it some discounted gift that they recall with warmth and fondness? Some deal that they found? Or is it the family members and loved ones with whom they spent the holiday time? Breaking up the flow of a real holiday so you can make it on time to the beginning of the Black Friday holiday seems a little misguided. It is one thing during the holiday season to be touched by the poignancy of long lines at soup kitchens and food pantries; it is quite another to witness throngs in the darkness bearing credit cards, waiting to stampede through stores in desperate and hungry-eyed pursuit of flat-screen TVs and Blu-Ray players. At least earnest groups of neighborhood vocalists are not -- yet -- going door-to-door singing Black Friday carols. But just give them time. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Holiday season too commercialized? No, Black Friday has become a holiday .

Dr. Charles Gholdoian, 46, was killed, and patient Shawntae Spears, 20, was wounded, Reno Deputy Police Chief Mac Venzon said at a news conference. Dr. Christine Lajeunesse is in critical condition, but conscious, a spokeswoman for the city told CNN on Wednesday night. Spears and Lajeunesse suffered single gunshot wounds. Spears also is in critical condition at Renown Regional Medical Center. The investigation, which includes interviews with 29 witnesses, indicates the shooter walked past the front desk to a patient exam room area and fired five rounds from his 12-gauge shotgun. He later killed himself with the weapon, Venzon said. The shooting occurred at the Urology Nevada office on the third floor of a medical building near Renown, leading investigators to believe it wasn't random, Venzon said. Asked to explain, the deputy chief said the shooter passed the first and second floors, and making ""his way to the third floor of the building would indicate to me this is not a random event."" He further said that it did not appear the shooter had a relationship with any of the victims, but the matter is still under investigation. Police don't have a motive. Kat Raco, an ophthalmic technician who works on the second floor of the Nevada Advanced Medicine building, told CNN that she heard at least two large booms and then the sound of scampering feet above her. Raco said she and others in her office were seeing patients when the shooting occurred and first thought someone or something had fallen. Police were there quickly, she said, telling them to lock the doors and not let anyone in. About 10 minutes after that, more police escorted everyone on the second floor to a catwalk between the building and a parking garage. A plainclothes officer asked questions before staff was allowed to leave about 45 minutes after the shooting. ""The police handled it in the best way possible,"" Raco said. ""They were very professional and calm. Everyone (in the office) stayed pretty calm."" Raco said there are no armed guards in the building. The medical center describes itself as the only Level II trauma center in that region of Nevada and is home to the area's only Children's Hospital, its website says. The facility also offers the region's largest number of clinical research trials. Last month, there was a hospital shooting in Wisconsin when police shot and wounded an armed man on the neonatal intensive care floor of a Milwaukee-area children's hospital, authorities said. Milwaukee police had gone to the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin to arrest the man on a felony warrant and found him holding a child in the intensive care unit, authorities said. Instead of surrendering, the man took out a handgun and fled down a hallway, prompting police to shoot him. Colorado school shooter planned larger attack, Sheriff's Office says .

"(CNN) -- The Marussia Formula One team has ruled out a mechanical fault as the cause of a test crash which resulted in its female driver losing her right eye. Maria de Villota was left in a serious condition after colliding with a stationary truck during a test event at a British airfield earlier this month, and needed two operations. The Russian-owned marque has conducted extensive tests of the MR01 car involved in the incident, alongside investigations by British regulator the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and an external forensic body, but concluded a vehicular fault was not to blame. Webber signs one-year contract extension . ""We are satisfied that the findings of our internal investigation exclude the car as a factor in the accident,"" Marussia team principal John Booth said in a statement. ""We have shared and discussed our findings with the HSE for their consideration as part of their ongoing investigation. This has been a necessarily thorough process in order to understand the cause of the accident. ""We have now concluded our investigatory work and can again focus on the priority, which continues to be Maria's wellbeing. In that regard, we continue to support Maria and the De Villota family in any way we can."" De Villota family touched by support . De Villota, who was driving the MR01 for the first time before the crash, is one of only two female drivers contracted to an F1 team. The other, Britain's Susie Wolff, has a development role at Williams. The Spaniard's father Emilio de Villota was also an F1 driver between 1976 and 1982. Marussia will now continue its preparations for this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, the 10th race of the 2012 season.","Marussia F1 team rules out car as cause of Maria De Villota's crash .

"Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (CNN) -- In a dangerous escalation of border violence, South Sudan accused rival Sudan of war mongering Wednesday and said it had shot down a fighter jet sent to bomb the oil-rich Pan Akuac region. South Sudanese Chief Negotiator Pagan Amum charged that Sudan was orchestrating fresh attacks against its southern neighbor. The Sudan People's Liberation Army, he said, shot down a MiG-29 jet fighter in South Sudan's Unity state. The hostilities put a bitter note on negotiations between the two nations at an African Union meeting in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. Former South African President Thabo Mbeki, who heads up a mediation panel, said both parties had laid out a six-point plan to reduce escalating tensions that included an immediate cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of armed forces from each other's territory. The South Sudan delegation was ready to sign but Khartoum declined and said President Omar al-Bashir would have to review the agreement. Amum called on his counterpart to come back to the table to finalize the agreement. But the Sudanese defense minister and his delegation left Ethiopia and Amum said he received word about the Unity state attacks Wednesday afternoon. The Addis Ababa talks have been marred all along with fresh border violence. Upon independence last year, South Sudan took 75% of the formerly united country's oil reserves, and oil accounts for 98% of the new state's revenues. Both countries are suffering economically since an oil production shutdown began in January. Border and citizenship agreements could open the way to a deal to resume oil production. Recent clashes, however, cast doubt on whether either country would honor any agreements. Aside from clashes between government forces, both countries accuse each other of supporting militia or rebel forces in their territories. In a statement Wednesday, the African Union expressed concern for the escalating violence along the 1,200 mile border and in Southern Kordofan state. An African Union panel will travel to both Khartoum and Juba -- the South Sudan capital -- to meet with al-Bashir and South Sudan President Salva Kiir Mayardit before the two leaders attend a summit. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland urged South Sudan last month to cease military support for rebels fighting the Khartoum government in the states of Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan. Southern officials have repeatedly denied providing support to the rebels. Nuland also demanded that Khartoum ""end aerial bombardments of civilian areas."" The war has already sent more than 100,000 refugees across the border into South Sudan, and the United States and United Nations have warned that hundreds more could follow, fleeing hunger and violence. Journalist Tom Walsh contributed to this report.","South Sudan accuses its northern neighbor of war mongering .

"(CNN) -- Formula 1's sole tire suppliers Pirelli -- whose products came in for yet more criticism during Sunday's stop-start Spanish Grand Prix -- have admitted that some of the testing they conduct on their tires is ""inadequate"". In 100 minutes of driving in Barcelona this weekend, a total of 82 pit stops were made by the field of 22 drivers -- prompting many involved at the top end of the sport to launch frustrated tirades about how intense tire degradation is ruining F1 racing. Milan-based Pirelli have revealed they are announcing changes to their range of F1 tires on Tuesday, which may delight those who point out that many of F1's biggest stars sometimes lap slower than their counterparts in GP2. ""Winter tests are inadequate and carried out in conditions far from the reality of the season's races,"" Pirelli spokesman Francesco Tarallo told CNN. ""The cars are much faster this year than last year (as well)."" The admission of the inadequacy of the testing will increase the pressure on Pirelli, who were tasked in 2011 -- when they took on the sole supplier role -- with designing a less durable tire in order to force more pit stops and so create more unpredictable racing. Red Bull team boss Dietrich Mateschitz says this policy has gone too far, with the Austrian deeply critical of what he sees as the debilitating effects of fast-wearing tires after Sunday's fifth race of the season. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso won on home soil, with Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber finishing fourth and fifth respectively. ""Everyone knows what is happening,"" Mateschitz told Austrian reporters. ""This has nothing to do with racing any more. This is a competition in tire management."" ""Real car racing looks different. Under the given circumstances, we can neither get the best out of our car nor our drivers. There is no more real qualifying and fighting for the pole, as everyone is just saving tires for the race. ""If we would make the best of our car we would have to stop eight or 10 times a race, depending on the track."" Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya is always tough on tires, but even Pirelli's motorsport director Paul Hembery felt that the level of pit stops -- with Alonso changing tires four times -- was too much. ""Strategy was again at the forefront of the Spanish Grand Prix, which as usual was very demanding on the tires because of the unique characteristics of this circuit,"" the Briton said. ""This is why we saw high levels of degradation, which should not be seen again to this extent for the rest of the year. Our aim is to have between two and three stops at every race, so it's clear that four is too many: in fact, it's only happened once before, in Turkey during our first year in the sport."" In that 2011 Turkish Grand Prix, Red Bull duo Vettel and Webber finished first and second respectively but the German, a three-time world champion, concedes that his team's driving is having a negative effect on the Pirellis. ""The first three cars were a little bit too fast for us and regarding looking after the tires, they did a better job,"" said Vettel, who leads the championship by four points from Lotus's Kimi Raikkonen (who finished second on Sunday). ""We need to catch up; we're not going the pace of the car, we're going the pace of the tires and obviously we do something to make the tires wear more."" Tire degradation was the major talking point on Sunday, with Force India driver Paul Di Resta so bewildered by the number of stops that he radioed his team during the race to ask: ""Can anybody tell me what is going on?"" Di Resta was the highest-placed Briton in the race, finishing seventh, just ahead of compatriot Jenson Button --- who shed further light on the effects of the tires in his post-race comments. ""When we're going round doing laps three seconds slower than a GP2 car did in qualifying, and only six seconds quicker than a GP3 car did in the race, there's something wrong,"" the McLaren driver said. ""This is the pinnacle of motor sport. We shouldn't be driving round so slowly to look after the tires."" Button added that even the thrill of overtaking has diminished considerably, since drivers know that they are often going past because ""the other guy's tires are destroyed"", while the need to ensure that the tires do not get too hot or cold demand extreme concentration from those at the wheel. So drivers may be buoyed by the changes that Pirelli are set to announce on Tuesday. ""We'll be looking to make some changes, in time for Silverstone, to make sure that we maintain our target and solve any issues rapidly,"" said Hembery. Before the British Grand Prix takes place on June 28-30, there are two more races where the drivers will have to use the existing tires. The first takes place on May 26 in Monaco, where tire degradation is rarely an issue given the narrow streets and slow corners, whereas next month's Canadian GP may well throw up similar issues to the pain in Spain suffered by most drivers on Sunday.","F1 supplier Pirelli admit inadequacies of winter testing .

"(CNN) -- Hurricane Barbara weakened to a tropical storm Wednesday after it crashed ashore along Mexico's southern Pacific coast. Barely a hurricane, the moisture-laden storm made landfall in the state of Chiapas, about 20 miles west of Tonala, the U.S.-based National Hurricane Center said. Barbara had sustained winds then of 75 mph, and was moving north-northeast at 9 mph. Winds weakened to 50 mph by Wednesday night. The storm was about 50 miles west-northwest of Tuxtla Gutierrez, according to the hurricane center's last advisory. Barbara is expected to dump between 6-10 inches of rain, with up to 20 inches possible in some areas. ""These rains could cause life-threatening flash floods and mud slides,"" the hurricane center warned. On the forecast track, Barbara is expected to move over southeastern Mexico into Thursday. Rapid weakening is forecast during that time. Barbara is expected to dissipate within days. The storm is the second of the eastern Pacific hurricane season, after Tropical Storm Alvin this month.","NEW: Barbara dumps heavy rain over parts of southeastern Mexico .

"(CNN) -- World champion Sebastian Vettel apologized to Red Bull teammate Mark Webber after defying orders to snatch a ""risky"" victory at the Malaysian Grand Prix on Sunday and go to the top of the driver standings. Webber had been poised for the 10th victory of his career and first since July as he led comfortably after the team's final pit stops, and was told to hold back to maintain his car until the finish at the Sepang circuit. Vettel, however, took the opportunity to edge past the veteran Australian and claim his 27th race win, having started from pole position for the second time in two events this season. ""I want to say sorry to Mark,"" the German told reporters, having been rebuked by his team boss Christian Horner on the radio as they dueled on the track. ""This is silly Seb, come on,"" Horner warned. ""He was trying to save the car and tires, but I took a lot of risk in passing him when he was trying,"" the 25-year-old Vettel added. ""I didn't ignore that, but I shouldn't have done it."" He later said on the Red Bull website: "" I put myself above a team decision, which was wrong. I didn't mean to and I apologize. I'm not happy I've won, I made a mistake and if I could undo it I would. It's not easy right now and I owe apologies to Mark and the team."" Webber, who has often complained that triple world champion Vettel has favored status within the Austrian-owned team, made his displeasure known at the postrace press conference. ""The first part of GP went very well,"" the 36-year-old said. ""In the end we got the right strategy, and it was about controlling the race, getting everything in the race right, but the team told me to turn the engine down. ""But I want to race as well. Seb made his own decisions and he will have protection as usual and that's the way it goes."" See: Sepang interactive and latest standings . He also added a statement on the team website. ""There's a bit of history to this as well; my mind in the last 15 laps was thinking about a lot of things,"" Webber said. ""Of course I'm not satisfied with the result. This puts heat on a few people and unfortunately there's no rewind button. I know people want raw emotion from us after these situations and it's there, but we need to remain cool. There's three weeks until the next race, so time for us to work on things."" Horner said the incident was ""frustrating."" ""Formula One is both a team and an individual sport and sometimes there is a conflict between a driver's desire and a team's interest,"" he said. ""What happened today is something that shouldn't have happened. ""Our position after that final pit stop was all about managing the race until the end and conserving our tires, getting the cars to the finish and achieving maximum points."" Team orders have long been a controversial part of F1, and were banned in 2002. However, that rule was dropped in 2011 after it became apparent that teams were finding ways around it. On Sunday, Lewis Hamilton benefited from team orders as he claimed his first podium finish for Mercedes after colleague Nico Rosberg was told not to attack him as both drivers were seeking to maintain their cars. Team boss Ross Brawn said on the radio: ""Negative Nico, negative. Lewis' pace is what we are asking him to do. He can go a lot faster as well, so please be in control as well."" ""If I'm honest he should be standing here, he's a great teammate and did a fantastic job,"" Hamilton said of Rosberg, who outperformed seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher at Mercedes the past three seasons. ""We brought the car home and I'm glad to get a result for them, but it's not the best feeling being up here."" The 2008 world champion almost made an embarrassing error when he tried to pit in the garage of his former team McLaren -- bringing back memories of when Jenson Button did similar soon after his move to the British marque. ""I did a Jenson as he did that a couple of years ago,"" the English driver said. ""I've had so many years making pit stops with McLaren, but I got it wrong, so a big apology to my teammate."" Button's disappointing season continued when he failed to finish in the points after being sent out from his final pit stop with a loose front wheel, having been fifth at one stage. His new teammate Sergio Perez scored his first points for McLaren as he came home ninth ahead of Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne. Felipe Massa claimed fifth place but his Ferrari teammate Fernando Alonso -- the race winner in Sepang last year and overall runnerup -- paid for an early mistake that broke his front wing and ended his 200th career grand prix as he stayed out on the track too long without getting it repaired. ""Today we had a good car, and I don't think we were too far from the Red Bull pace, especially in the race,"" the Spaniard said. ""Looking now after the incident for sure it is the wrong decision (to stay on the track). If this unlucky combination had not happened, and in lap three we stop, we change the tire and the nose and we win the race here, the team are heroes."" Romain Grosjean was sixth for Lotus ahead of teammate Kimi Raikkonen, who won the opening race in Melbourne last Sunday but this time started from 10th after being given a three-place penalty for blocking Rosberg during Saturday's qualifying. The Finn was fastest in Friday's practice, but downplayed his hopes in the race. Nico Hulkenberg was eighth to earn Sauber's first points this season.","Sebastian Vettel wins Malaysia Grand Prix from Red Bull teammate Mark Webber .

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN) -- A man named Ernesto pressed an old-fashioned radio to his ear, listening to a baseball game roughly 5,000 miles away. Ernesto listens to the Baseball World Cup gold medal game by radio in Havana. The U.S. beat Cuba 10-5. ""Oh, it's already over,"" he groaned, listening to the staccato play-by-play of Sunday's Baseball World Cup championship. In the gold-medal game, played in Nettuno, Italy, team USA defeated Cuba, 10-5, to wrap up the World Cup played this year throughout Europe. In the winning country, that news likely was overshadowed in most places by Major League Baseball, professional football, or dozens of other sports stories that developed on Sunday. But in Cuba, where baseball is as much a source of national pride as it is a game, the Baseball World Cup was big news. Reverberations of that last out in Italy could be felt as far away as Havana's central park, where a daily gaggle of baseball fans often provide for the country's liveliest debate. ""The American pitching was strong,"" said Ernesto, still listening to the crackle and pop of his radio. ""But Cuban batters were not as good,"" he added. For the widely anticipated match-up, Havana residents holed up in their homes Sunday afternoon to watch their national team take on their northern neighbor on TV. Those without televisions huddled around a small radio in the capital's central park, appearing to hang on every broadcasted pitch. ""Strike three!"" the radio sputtered as another Cuban batter was retired by U.S. starter Cory Luebke, who tallied seven strike-outs in four-and-a-third innings. He prompted a near-unison groan among the group. The United States, led by Los Angeles Dodgers prospect Lucas May, scored early and often as May put the Americans ahead with a second inning three-run home run. The Cubans refused to go quietly, rallying in the fourth inning and scoring two runs on three singles. A two-run blast by Cuban first baseman Ariel Borrero in the sixth inning tied the game at 4-4 before a salvo of U.S. hits in the seventh drove in six runs, enough  to secure the American win. For team USA, the contest capped a 14-game winning streak that began after a first-round loss to Venezuela. Sunday's win is only the fourth U.S. championship in World Cup competition, with Americans having previously earned gold in 1973, 1974 and 2007. For the Cubans, whose teams have brought home gold in 25 of the last 30 Baseball World Cup championships their country has played in, it was time to start looking ahead in quintessential baseball philosophy. ""They won it this year, but we will win it the next,"" said one Havana resident who declined to give his name. Long a baseball powerhouse, Cuba has never finished out of the top three in World Cup competition, according to International Baseball Federation spokesman Jake Fehling. But million-dollar contracts in professional baseball often have lured away top Cuban prospects and depleted national team talent, pulling star athletes such as Orlando ""El Duque"" Hernandez and Jose Contreras away from state salaries at home. Cuban pitcher Ardoldis Chapman, who defected in July during a national trip to the Netherlands, is the latest example of top Cuban players seeking the bigger payoffs of major-league salaries. Chapman, a lefty who reportedly throws over 100 mph, has sparked rumors of a potential bidding war among top major-league franchises. Residents in Havana's central park, however, were unwilling Sunday to say more than a few words about the loss of star talent. ""If they leave, they leave,"" Ernesto said, still clinging to his radio. Players come and go, but in Cuba, baseball -- and baseball talk -- is one steadying constant. And in Havana's central park, the talk of Sunday's game -- the talk of baseball -- buzzed on, long after the last pitch was thrown.","Havana residents flock to radios, TV to watch Baseball World Cup title game .

"(CNN) -- Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher has continued to pillory Pirelli's tires, complaining that they are like driving on ""raw eggs."" The Mercedes driver blamed the quicker degradation of the Italian manufacturer's products for the scenario which has seen four race winners in as many starts this season, and much closer competition between the drivers. ""I just think that they're playing a much too big effect because they are so peaky and so special that they don't put our cars or ourselves to the limit,"" he told CNN ahead of this weekend's Spanish Grand Prix. ""We drive like on raw eggs and I don't want to stress the tires at all. Otherwise you just overdo it and you go nowhere."" The 43-year-old German has been a vocal critic of Pirelli, calling on the company to rethink its approach after several drivers struggled with tire degradation during last month's Bahrain Grand Prix. He was backed by McLaren team boss Martin Whitmarsh, whose drivers also struggled with the tires. Jenson Button suffered a puncture with three laps remaining, retiring on the penultimate lap, while Lewis Hamilton finished down in eighth and lost his championship lead to race winner Sebastian Vettel. Pirelli replaced Bridgestone as F1's sole tire supplier in 2011, winning a three-year contract. Bridgestone had been the sole provider from 2007-2010, after Michelin pulled out. However, Pirelli has argued it should be congratulated for such an open, unpredictable season. The manufacturer claimed it was simply responding to calls for more eventful racing, with director Paul Hembery saying: ""We are pushing the limits. ""It's a very, very aggressive approach that we took. It's what we were asked to do. We were asked to bring challenges to the teams and this is what we've done."" Schumacher's teammate Nico Rosberg, however, had a very different view on the tires. The 26-year-old German, who won the Chinese Grand Prix last month for his first victory in 111 attempts, took a positive spin on the unpredictability. ""I find it a big challenge for us drivers and an interesting challenge. It's different but very interesting,"" he told CNN. ""This tire management, getting the most out of it, understanding when to push, when to take it easy. It's so on a knife's edge with the tires that it's good and it's great for racing. It's great, it's mixed everything up, lots of overtaking, lots of things happening, fantastic for everybody."" While Rosberg is sixth in the drivers' rankings, Schumacher is languishing in 18th as he seeks his first podium placing since coming out of retirement in 2010. However, the former Ferrari star is proud to see younger compatriots such as Rosberg, Nico Hulkenberg of Force India and Marussia's Timo Glock with him on the 24-strong grid this season, and he reserved special praise for Red Bull's double world champion Vettel. ""Being good friends, particularly with Sebastian, sort of makes it even more special because he grew up on my go-kart track,"" Schumacher said. ""We know each other from childhood. His childhood mainly -- I was a little bit grown up by that stage. And seeing him do well makes me proud."" The Mercedes cars have been a lot more competitive this season, and Schumacher hopes they can transform their improved pace with more consistent race results. ""We have got one win under our belt. Got a bit unlucky in that race -- could have been a one-two without a doubt -- but it proves that we made a huge step because we have to consider where we come from,"" he said. ""Last year wasn't really what we were looking for. Starting the Silver Arrow new generation we had media success and finally we managed a victory, and I'm pretty sure we can have other good races this year being on the podium, and maybe even being on top of the podium.""","Michael Schumacher criticizes Pirelli's tires, complaining they degrade too quickly .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari president Luca Di Montezemelo has launched an end of season salvo at F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, saying ""the era of the one man show cannot continue"" if the sport is to move forward. ""We are approaching the time when we need to think about the future,"" said Di Montezemolo, who was unhappy about the role Ecclestone played in the controversy surrounding the last race in Brazil where Sebastian Vettel clinched the title from Ferrari No.1 Fernando Alonso. Ferrari believed Vettel may have made an illegal overtaking move under a yellow flag which, should he have been punished, would have meant Alonso took the title instead. ""Every so often, Bernie likes to play the boss and gets involved in matters that don't concern him: godfathers no longer exist, at least not in Formula 1,"" Di Montezemolo was quoted on the official Ferrari website. ""Interpretation of flags, be they yellow or blue is nothing to do with him and he used expressions that I do not accept. ""Our behavior in this instance was not only transparent, but perfect and maybe he would do better to think about attracting bigger crowds and more youngsters, and to discuss more with the television stations and the media."" Di Montezemolo conceded that Ecclestone had achieved ""significant things"" but that at 82 years of age questions should be asked about his continued stewardship of the sport. ""It's not a case of replacing Bernie and in fact I do not like doing to others what I would not want to happen to myself. ""The future should be in the hands of a team that will look after all the different areas. ""We are slowly approaching the end of a period characterized by the style of one man who has done significant things."" Ecclestone recently said he would only quit when he felt he was not doing a good job. ""I hope that's what I can do; when I feel I can't deliver, I will certainly say goodbye,"" he was quoted on the official F1 website. Di Montezemolo again reiterated his opposition to the ban on testing during the F1 grand prix season and said he would be putting across his arguments when he meets Ecclestone and FIA president Jean Todt. ""As for testing, it's getting close to ridiculous,"" he said. ""The FIA is not opposed to it, we are not and so what is the reason for it, "" he added. He also congratulated Red Bull and Vettel on their double victory in the drivers' and constructors' championship. Vettel, who clinched a title hat-trick in Brazil, ""had an amazing car and is a great driver,"" said Di Montezemolo. ""If for whatever reason, Alonso was to retire, then I'd like Vettel, a driver who has his feet on the ground and a great will to win.""

"(CNN) -- When Jackie Stewart speaks about driver safety in Formula One, it's worth listening. The racing legend was a pioneer in raising standards in an era when mortality rates were high, and his legacy has left F1 stars with greater support than ever before. But he is still worried about one burning issue -- the controversy over sole supplier Pirelli's tires, which he says are dangerous due to their rapid rate of degradation. The three-time world champion told CNN that drivers risked a ""multiple-car accident"" unless immediate improvements are made. ""I don't think that amount of rubber should be coming off the tires and be left to the side of the track,"" the 72-year-old said. ""If you go over that rubber it then sticks to the terribly hot -- above 100C (212F) -- tires. ""When you get to the next corner your car is now totally unstable, and when you're going to brake you'll probably lose control of your car. If there's a car close to you then that will cause a multiple-car accident -- it has to be improved."" The Scotsman, who notched up 27 wins in an F1 career spanning eight years, also blamed the tires for the exceptionally open season. Four different drivers have won each of the four races so far, ahead of the start of the European swing in Spain this weekend. ""An issue that nobody can quite work out is how the tire wheel, tire temperatures work,"" Stewart said. ""We've seen a lot of winning and losing because of when people have chosen or not chosen to go into the pits."" The ""Flying Scot"" -- as he was nicknamed during his racing days -- agreed with Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher's criticisms of the Italian tire manufacturer. Seven-time world champion Schumacher has complained about the quicker degradation of the tires and even likened them to driving on ""on raw eggs."" McLaren team boss Martin Whitmarsh, whose drivers Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button struggled with their tires at the Bahrain Grand Prix, has also criticized Pirelli. Meanwhile Schumacher's teammate Nico Rosberg, who won the China Grand Prix last month, argued the unpredictability made racing interesting. Pirelli has argued it should be congratulated for such an open, unpredictable season. The manufacturer claimed it was simply responding to calls for more eventful racing, with director Paul Hembery saying: ""We are pushing the limits."" Stewart, who won the Spanish Grand Prix three times, said the high caliber of this season's drivers made it anyone's championship. ""They're probably the best bunch of drivers I've seen since the late '60s, early '70s when we had around eight or nine drivers capable of winning."" He said Nico Rosberg's win in China could finally spell a comeback for Mercedes. It was the German marque's first race win since Juan Manuel Fangio in Italy in 1955. This week the team played down reports it could be set to quit F1. British newspaper The Times claimed UK-based Mercedes could be forced out over a power dispute arising from F1's proposed stock exchange flotation. A Mercedes spokesman said only that they were ""in discussions with the commercial rights holder."" But Stewart believes this could be Mercedes' season, saying they were ""giants."" ""The Silver Arrow has been winning races since the '20s and '30s and came back in the '50s and won races,"" he said. ""If they hadn't won that race (in China) and showed themselves to be that competitive in the ones immediately following it, I think there might have been a chance of Mercedes Benz withdrawing from Formula One.""","Three-time world champion Jackie Stewart says Pirelli's F1 tires are dangerous .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Like his long-time hero Stevie Wonder, Nigerian music pioneer Cobhams Asuquo was born visually-impaired. And again, like the American R&B legend, the lack of sight was never enough to stop Asuquo from realizing his ambitions. Instead, it only fueled his optimism and desire to achieve success. ""Being blind has played an integral role in forming who I am and I think to some extent is responsible for my optimism,"" says Asuquo, an award-winning music producer, song-writer and musician. ""When you feel there's nothing more to lose -- if you want to work towards anything, you probably will want to work towards gaining and I think that's what being blind has done for me."" A versatile musical talent, Asuquo has been pushing the boundaries of Nigeria's contemporary sound. His fresh mixture of different styles and beats has helped the west African country become one the continent's modern music hotspots. ""I fuse a lot of stuff to create my music"" he says. ""It varies -- it's jazz, it's classical, it's Afro, it's whatever, it depends on what best interprets the music."" 'Ghana's Bob Marley' spreads message of brotherhood . Possessed of natural talent, the self-taught musician started honing his skills from an early age while growing up in a barracks. As a young boy, he used to organize concerts in his neighborhood, drumming on his mother's barrels of water. ""All the kids from the neighboring block would come and we'd hang out and we'd make so much noise. I didn't realize at the time that I was preparing myself for what would be my life, my career path, my destiny,"" Asuquo remembers. His musical journey, however, seemed to come to a halt a few years later when he entered university to pursue studies in law. But Asuquo soon realized that he had to follow his musical passion, leaving university to embark on a path that, for a young blind musician in Nigeria, was far from easy to tread. ""(I had to) sleep on studio floors all across Lagos, worked at different studios, worked without pay, I've been out on the road, out on the streets, doing my thing,"" Asuquo recalls. ""I had to convince people that I could do it -- I had sessions that were canceled because they weren't sure I could deliver either because they thought I was too young or maybe as a blind person, 'how do we trust our music which is our future and investment?'"" he adds. But it didn't take long for Asuquo to prove himself as his musical talent soon began to shine. Over the next few years he went on to work closely with internationally-renowned artists such as pop sensation Asa and R&B star Darey and today he is a much-in demand producer operating from his own studio. Meet Asa, African pop legend in the making . He is also a judge on Nigeria's ""Project Fame,"" a television musical talent show where he helps young singers achieve their dreams. ""It's important for me to mentor and inspire fresh talent, to work with fresh talent,"" he says. ""I feel there is a lot I've learned in my journey as far as music is concerned and I'm in a position to share that knowledge."" But Asuquo is not only interested in helping out fledgling music stars. He also sees himself as an ambassador for blind young Nigerians who still face many challenges in their daily lives. ""I think it would be meaningless if I can achieve as much as I can achieve and as much as I hope to achieve and I'm not able to affect other blind people,"" he says. ""It is time to bring to the fore the needs of people with special needs and just how much they can contribute to growing Nigeria as a nation and the world.""

"(CNN) -- Two years after losing part of her lung during an operation to remove a life-threatening blood clot, newly-crowned U.S. Open champion Serena Williams insists playing tennis ""is just fun now."" The world No. 1's battle-weary opponents might not be having so much fun after Williams successfully defended the Flushing Meadows title she won in 2012 against the same opponent, beating second seed Victoria Azarenka 7-5 6-7 6-1 to secure her fifth singles championship in New York. It is a far cry from where the now 17-time grand slam singles champion was in July 2010 when she suffered a cut to her right foot and was later diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism which left her on her death bed. That 11 months of ""hell"" culminated in her descent to No. 175 in the world rankings in July 2011. Since then four grand slams have been won by Williams during a truly dominant 14-month spell. One more major triumph would see her sit level with legendary compatriots Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert in fourth position on the list of the most prolific female grand slam champions of all time. ""It was the toughest thing I've been through in my life,"" the 31-year-old told CNN. ""One thing kept happening after another, blood clots in both of my lungs, I lost part of my lung, I had to retrain. I don't have two full lungs anymore. ""You go through this stage of thinking, 'Why does all of this keep happening.' It was really 11 months of hell. ""When I'm on that court and I'm facing opponents, I feel like I've faced so many tougher opponents that this is just fun now."" Williams' lung problems only became obvious when she was rushed into hospital after experiencing breathing difficulties en route to an Oscars party in March 2011. ""Being in the emergency room and being in hospital for all of that time, not knowing if I would ever pick up a racket again, not even caring, just wanting to be healthy,"" recalled Williams. ""That was a tough time for me."" She is indeed healthy again and operating at the peak of her powers at an age when many of her contemporaries are seemingly struggling to last the pace. Roger Federer has seen his vice-like grip on men's tennis loosen as he heads deeper into his 30s, while Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli retired last month at the age of 28. However, Williams maintains a childlike enthusiasm for sport, aided in no small way by the perspective she gained during her battle to regain her form and fitness. ""I feel like just going for broke now,"" she said. ""I'm really focused on what I want to do, I'm just having a lot of fun out there. ""I'm like '31 is old,' but that doesn't seem like me. I don't act like it [her age] either so maybe that has something to do with it."" Williams' muscular physique sets her apart from physically smaller opponents and she remains proud of how she managed to combine power with femininity. ""It's OK to be strong and to be powerful and to be beautiful and to love who you are,"" she added. ""You can stand up to anyone and you can be proud of who you are, where you come from and be a positive awesome girl.""","Serena Williams win her fifth U.S. Open women's singles title .

"(CNN) -- Spain's Jorge Lorenzo extended his lead in the world championship standings with a storming victory in the British MotoGP at Silverstone Sunday. The Yamaha rider overhauled reigning world championship Casey Stoner midway through the race and went clear for his 42nd career title. Only a bad mistake with four laps to go might have cost Lorenzo, but he had time to spare to recover and cross the line clear of Stoner whose Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa of Spain finished third. It extended Lorenzo's lead over Australia's Stoner, who has announced he will retire at the end of the season, to 25 points. ""It was wonderful fighting with Casey... We're having a fantastic season, we can't ask for more,"" Lorenzo told the official post-race press conference. Stoner reflected on a difficult day: ""It wasn't a great race for us today, we saw the pace the Yamahas had in the early laps and it was really worrying to me. As early as lap three the bike wasn't feeling good,"" he added. Alvaro Bautista of Spain, who had claimed pole, took fourth place ahead of American Ben Spies on the second Yamaha. Cal Crutchlow gave the home crowd reason to cheer with a battling display to finish sixth after starting on the back of the grid having crashed and missed qualifying Saturday. Italian star Valentino Rossi again struggled on his Ducati, finishing a disappointing ninth.

"Editor's note: Ed Foster is the associate editor of Motor Sport magazine. He is also an F1 pundit for CNN's World Sport show and writes blogs for CNN.com International. (Motor Sport) -- Now we have seven different winners from the first seven races of the Formula One season. There's never been anything like it in the history of the sport. Whether it will become eight from eight in Valencia this weekend is anyone's guess. The latest beneficiary in the on-track ""lottery"" was Lewis Hamilton in Canada, five years on from his first F1 win at the same circuit. But the only thing really surprising about the result was that it took so long for the 2008 world champion to get his name on the 2012 winners' list. Who would have thought that Williams' Pastor Maldonado would win a race before Hamilton this year? Maybe a few people after the Brit's performance in 2011 -- the year that he was seemingly driving a magnet to Felipe Massa's car, such were the number of times the two collided. It was the year of the deep depression, when off-track woes became on-track nightmares. Okay, he won two races, in Germany and Abu Dhabi, but McLaren teammate Button won three. A new management company in the shape of Simon Fuller's XIX Entertainment -- other customers: the Beckhams, Jennifer Lopez and former UK Pop Idol winner Will Young -- did little to ease the minds of Lewis' fans and team. Latest F1 standings ahead of European Grand Prix . What was happening to the man who walked into the F1 paddock in 2007 as if he had been racing there for years? Why the sudden downturn in performance from the record-setting racer who finished on the podium in his first nine F1 races? ""With both our drivers, with Lewis and Jenson, they have a continued drive to learn,"" McLaren's managing director Jonathan Neale told me when I quizzed him on the subject. ""It's just part of the learning process. It's been commented on ... the process has been gradual, the process of taking life's knocks. ""Lewis has adapted progressively and it's very easy -- as we all know -- when you're on a roll to build yourself a virtuous spiral, confidence will get you a long way. Likewise, when it goes the other way you can get a dose of the jitters. The difference between success and failure is really small. ""It's an enormous pressure on young people to have the white heat of public scrutiny and media attention on you. When you look at some of these drivers -- whether it's Lewis or (Sergio) Perez -- look at what we're expecting of them week in, week out. It's a huge ask. ""Nothing can prepare you for that. The innate talent was in there with Lewis, but you've still got to survive the ravages of the pit lane. And that's hard."" Pirelli chief backs tire critic Schumacher . This year, though, we seem to have the old Lewis back. The one who would go half a second faster than anyone else in qualifying. He did this at last month's Spanish Grand Prix, but he was promptly, and some say ridiculously, dropped to the back of the grid for not having enough fuel in his car -- a large price to pay for a small misjudgment by McLaren. It was his reaction that proved to everyone, however, that Lewis had sorted the problems that plagued his 2011 season. He didn't complain, he drove the wheels off the car and didn't make any contact on his way through the field to eighth place and four crucial points. The Canadian Grand Prix was remarkable in that Lewis finally cracked his 2012 nut, but interesting too because he conserved his tires beautifully. His teammate, the one famous for being gentle on those Pirellis, couldn't. Button finished a lap behind in 16th at a circuit where, in 2011, he climbed from the back of the grid to win the race on the last lap. Lewis, meanwhile, was busy crashing into him. How F1's roulette tables have turned. Even stranger about Jenson's recent performances is that he has no idea why he is so slow. He's not blaming the tires -- take note Herr Schumacher -- but neither is he blaming anything else. He simply doesn't know where he's losing the time. In his title-winning year of 2009, Button won six of the first seven races for Brawn GP; he could do no wrong, he was unbeatable. Come the latter half of the season, though, he started to drop back down the field and couldn't work out why. His teammate Rubens Barrichello was busy winning races in the same car, so clearly it was capable. In the end it mattered not -- he sealed the championship in Brazil with a fifth-place finish, singing, very badly, ""We Are the Champions"" over the radio to his team. With the 2012 championship so tight, Button will need to work out where it's going wrong as soon as possible, otherwise he won't be singing any Queen numbers for a while. Maybe that's a good thing? The future seems brighter for Hamilton, though. He's arguably driving better now than he ever has, and the McLaren should be capable of being on the podium at every race this year. If he keeps up his level of performance for the next 13 races anything is possible.","Formula One circuit moves to Spain this weekend for European Grand Prix .

"Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) -- It really doesn't look like much, this mission control. About a dozen tables with monitors, men in the standard issue white lab coats. But this is North Korea's nerve center. From here scientists will be able to monitor their rocket when they try to fire a satellite into orbit. Our government minders have brought us here to the outskirts of the capital Pyongyang. It is all about access, this secretive regime opening its doors to the world's media -- CNN included -- to answer one question: is this a missile or a satellite? The head of the control center is huddled into a corner of the room, a crush of cameras around him. I manage to squeeze through to the front, literally straddling the sitting reporter in front of me.

""This is why we have invited you here,"" he replies before adding that he hopes the media can become supporters of the North Korean cause. Independent analysts though are still not totally convinced. They point to the technology itself. The rocket could easily be used for a missile as well as a satellite. ""Potentially yes, it can carry a warhead,"" says Russian space policy expert Yuri Karash. ""The nuclear warhead can be the same size as a suitcase (so) it is possible to deliver it, but in this case I believe it is a satellite,"" .

He trusts them but he does have questions. ""Is it a satellite or a missile? Ultimately it isn't about science, but the motives of North Korea,"" he says. There's a lot riding on this rocket launch. It has essentially scuttled a much needed food aid deal with the United States and is raising tensions in an already volatile Korean Peninsula. But in the last few days it has become clear that this is not just about technology, this is a spiritual quest, this is about honoring the memory of the founding father of the nation, Kim Il Sung. This week North Koreans mark 100 years since his birth.

"(CNN) -- Swedish poster boy Zlatan Ibrahimovic has delivered again -- the Swedish Postal Service is to honor the Paris Saint-Germain forward with his own range of stamps. Each year up to 60 different stamp motifs are commissioned in Sweden, with the initial decision about the subject made by the Postal Service's group of experts, with the finished Ibrahimovic product going on sale in March 2014. ""I've got to be on a corner of the stamp and it will be fun to see the finished result,"" said the 32-year-old striker in a statement. ""It's a great honor to be on a postage stamp, and I'm very proud to be selected,"" added the Sweden captain. ""I get a lot of bills and there are rarely great stamps. Maybe that will change now!"" 2013 has been something of an annus mirabilis for Ibrahimovic. The PSG forward has been nominated for the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or, an award given to the world's finest footballer, while an audacious overhead kick scored against England is a contender to win the prize for the year's best goal. His talents have inspired a vast array of tributes, from the monstrous Zlatan burger on sale in a Paris cafe to a lovingly-composed flick book of his recent audacious volley against Bastia. His autobiography -- entitled ""I am Zlatan Ibrahimovic"" -- containing the frank and forthright views for which the Swede is renowned is also selling well. A two-legged playoff against Portugal, with the first match scheduled for Friday, will decide whether Ibrahimovic can deliver his country to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Regardless of the outcome of the tie, which will conclude with the second leg in Stockholm on November 19, a range of Zlatan-inspired stamps will be released on March 27. ""We know from experience that people choose stamps based on their images,"" said Britt-Inger Hahne, director of stamps at the Swedish postal service. ""I am very proud and happy to announce that next year we will publish a booklet of stamps picturing Zlatan Ibrahimovic. ""If these stamps can help us reach new audiences, people that today neither send nor receive letters, that would be fantastic."" Ibrahimovic's PSG teammate Thiago Silva is in no doubt as to the former Barcelona forward's talents. Silva hopes Ibrahimovic will head off competition from four-time winner and former Barca teammate Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo to lift the Ballon d'Or in Zurich on January 13. ""As a football fan I love Ibrahimovic. I'm sure that he will be in the top three for the Ballon d'Or,"" Brazil captain Silva told Sky Italia.

"(CNN) -- Fernando Alonso is revved up and ready to go ahead of his home Grand Prix at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya Sunday. The 31-year-old has not won on Spanish soil since triumphing with Renault in 2006 but is in confident mood after taking 47 points from the opening four races of the season. And the Ferrari driver says the extra incentive of winning in front of his adoring supporters has given him an extra edge going into the first European race of the year. He told a press conference: ""I think it motivates you to race at home and you give an extra 10% on what you normally do, to take care of every detail of the weekend, starting from practice into qualifying and into the race. ""You try to do everything well, because you know that a nice result here, a nice podium finish or whatever will make you happy, will make the team happy and make many people in the grandstand happy. ""So, it's a special weekend, but after all those years I think you're OK with that extra motivation and it's not any more pressure. ""Now you've proved for many years that there's not a pressure or anything that will stop you doing well."" If Ferrari are to succeed in seeing off Red Bull and Lotus, then the team will need to avoid any trouble on the track -- a point not lost on Alonso. ""I think that maybe it's the first time we arrive with a competitive car, but that doesn't mean you will fight for top places if you don't do everything right and don't put together a good weekend,"" the double world champion added. ""In the first four races we were competitive. We thought we could fight for the top places if the race was without problems. ""We will try here to have a clean race with no problems and if that will be enough to put us in contention for the victory, it would be nice. ""But if it's not possible then we will try and be as high as possible. It is a weekend we approach with a positive mentality -- and not a defensive mentality like the first three years for me at Ferrari."" One man who Alonso will need to be wary of is triple world champion Sebastian Vettel, who currently sits 30 points clear of the Spaniard. Vettel, who won last time out in Bahrain, is expecting a difficult challenge with just ten points separating him from Lotus' Kimi Raikkonen. ""It is much too early to make any predictions,"" Vettel said. ""Who would be so bold as to predict the outcome of a 19-race championship after only four races? ""This weekend we have to concentrate on the modified tires and the work that we have to do before Sunday to get our car right."" Raikkonen, a two-time winner in Barcelona, finished second in Bahrain after coming home behind Vettel's Red Bull. And the Finn insists his team has much to do if they are to bridge the gap and claim a second victory of the season. ""To catch the leaders, we have to work twice as hard as they are,"" he told the Lotus website. ""It's no secret that we want more speed from the car in qualifying; it's so tight up there at the front and we really need to be on the first two rows to fight for victories every time. ""It's good to be able to start the European season where we are as this is when you see teams starting to push on with lots of new parts for the cars. ""It's still early days, but to have scored strong points since the start of the year is obviously better than not having them.

"(CNN) -- Fernando Alonso savored the sweet taste of victory in front of his home fans after kickstarting his Formula One title bid with a commanding victory in Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix. The two-time world champion won by more than nine seconds from Lotus' Kimi Raikkonen after starting from fifth on the grid, as he reduced his deficit behind overall leader Sebastian Vettel to 17 points. ""It's very special winning at home, it doesn't matter how many times you do, it's always like starting from zero,"" said the 31-year-old, whose only other victory at the Circuit de Catalunya was back in 2006 in the same season he won his second world title with Renault. ""It was fantastically emotional and the fans really helped because you feel the support from everyone. ""The last laps are very long because you want the race to finish as soon as possible, but I'm very happy for the team."" F1 interactive: Latest results and standings . It was a good day for Ferrari, as Felipe Massa bounced back from the three-place grid penalty that dropped him to ninth at the start, with the Brazilian claiming third on the podium ahead of Vettel and the German's Red Bull teammate Mark Webber. ""I was a little disappointed after qualifying yesterday, but the race was very good for us and we were very aggressive,"" Massa said. ""We struggled a bit on the tires to survive in a good way -- and the race was very good for us."" Alonso, who made a flying start, had four pit stops as opposed to the three of Raikkonen due to an early puncture but was able to take the checkered flag for the 32nd time in his career to move above Lewis Hamilton into third place overall. Raikkonen reduced Vettel's lead to just four points as the Finn finished second for the third successive race, having also won the season opener in Australia. ""I don't mind finishing second. I'm here only to do as good a race as I can and, despite finishing second, we have to take what we can from every race,"" the 2007 world champion said. Vettel said the difference in pace with his rivals was due to tire wear and not the cars. ""The first three cars were a little too fast for us and in looking after their tires they did a better job today. ""If you talk about race distances, then it's a different game. I think the car is quick enough, but there's something we do to the tires to make them wear more."" Pole-sitter Nico Rosberg was sixth for Mercedes as the team's pre-race worries about tire degradation proved correct -- Hamilton dropped from second at the start to finish outside the points in 12th. ""We have got a lot of work to do,"" Hamilton said. ""We both went backwards, but I went back a long, long way and I don't know why. We will go back to the drawing board and see what we can do."" Paul di Resta continued his solid season with seventh for Force India, while 2009 world champion Jenson Button fought back from a torrid qualifying on Saturday to claim eighth ahead of McLaren teammate Sergio Perez.

"(CNN) -- A new coalition of Syrian dissidents opposed to President Bashar al-Assad will have an ambassador in France, the French president said Saturday. The announcement is a boost for the coalition, which seeks to unite the opposition against the Syrian government under a single vision. The French decision to give the coalition an ambassador follows its pledge, and one by the United States, to support the coalition. The Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council have also endorsed the coalition. French President Francois Hollande met with the newly elected leader of the coalition, Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, in Paris on Saturday. Turkish town on Syrian border deals with fighting, ethnic differences . ""France reiterated how it was attached to finding a solution quickly and that solution must first pass through the affirmation of a political transition,"" Hollande said. ""This is why we took -- I took -- the decision to recognize the coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people."" The two leaders talked about ways in which the coalition could gain both legitimacy and credibility, Hollande said. The ambassadorship is a stamp of approval for the coalition's efforts to become the centralized conduit for aid, and for an integrated military command. The new coalition agreed that it wants al-Assad gone and that no one would talk with his government. Spokesman Mohammed Dugham said the only option now is a totally new government. Syria's new opposition leader expects more from the U.S. In Washington, a deputy spokesman for the State Department said the United States believes the decision to unite opposition groups marks the start of a democratic future for the Syrian people. Americans have yet to formally recognize the group, though, as a representative government. After 20 months of relentless turmoil, rebel forces had not had a unified vision for the country or single military plan to oust al-Assad, whose family has ruled Syria for more than four decades. The United States and Arab nations pressured the groups to get on the same page. Despite the opposition's unification efforts -- and in light of the government's defiance -- the bloody civil war rages on. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported that 136 people were killed Saturday. Another 122 were killed Friday. CNN cannot independently verify these figures.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods will be reunited with his former caddy at next week's U.S. Open after the world's top three golfers were paired together in the opening two rounds in Pennsylvania. The dream trio of Woods, Rory McIlroy and Masters winner Adam Scott will tee off from the first hole at the Merion Golf Club on Thursday at 1:14 p.m. local time and then at 7:44 a.m. on the 11th hole on Friday, the United States Golf Association said. It prompted the slumping McIlroy to take to twitter, writing ""Decent group for the first 2 rounds at Merion I see...."" Woods split with his caddy, Steve Williams, in 2011 in a move that left the New Zealander in ""shock."" Williams was beside Woods for 13 of his 14 major titles but now works with Scott. Williams later in 2011 apologized for making a racist remark aimed at Woods and this year reportedly said Woods should have been disqualified for an illegal drop at the Masters. There's more intrigue because Woods is firmly against anchored putting -- while anchored putting helped Scott claim his first major at Augusta in April. Last month, golf's governing bodies ruled that the use of anchored putters will be banned from 2016. Although he is the world No. 1, Woods hasn't won a major since the 2008 U.S. Open. World No. 2 McIlroy, meanwhile, missed the cut at last month's PGA Championship in Wentworth, England, the flagship event on the European Tour. He barely made the cut at last week's Memorial in Ohio.","Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Adam Scott tee off together at next week's U.S. Open .

"Mount Vernon, Washington (CNN) -- The first sign for a truck driver that something was wrong on a bridge on Interstate 5 that collapsed into Washington's Skagit River was the sound of a ""boom,"" a federal investigator said Saturday. At the same time, the driver felt a shudder, NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman told reporters. That's the moment, according to Hersman, the tractor-trailer hauling an oversized load Thursday struck one of the bridge's overhead trusses, causing it to collapse and sending vehicles into the river below. The latest details were released as state officials work to find a temporary solution for the bridge on the heavily traveled interstate near Mount Vernon, about 60 miles north of Seattle. Crews began extracting debris from the water early Monday, as a crane lifted a trailer from the river, CNN affiliate KIRO reported. The trailer broke, sending it and the truck cab that had towed it back into the water. Workers eventually got the wreckage onto a barge holding the crane, the station said. The plan later Monday was to pull the remaining vehicles from the water, as well as any metal parts of the bridge. ""They actually have hydraulic shears, basically like a pair of scissors, but very strong, and they'll be able to cut through that steel,"" Washington State Department of Transportation spokesman Dave Chesson told KIRO. How safe are the bridges you drive over? Heavy holiday weekend traffic along Interstate 5 was reported in both directions at the start of the holiday weekend as cars and trucks inched along a cumbersome detour that took vehicles off the interstate and onto county roads. Roughly 70,000 vehicles travel that portion of the interstate a day, according to the state Department of Transportation. The NTSB did not release the name of the truck driver. Hersman identified the man as a 41-year-old commercial driver with more than 20 years' experience -- the last eight with Canada-based Mullen Trucking. He has experience driving oversized loads along the same route, she said. Oversized load . The problem appears to have begun when the truck with its height of 15 feet, 9 inches, tried to cross the bridge, which has a clearance of 14 feet, 6 inches at its lowest point, according to Hersman. There was no sign indicating the bridge's height, she said. Washington state does not require such signs to be posted unless the clearance with a bridge is less than 14 feet, 4 inches. The 18-wheeler, which was hauling equipment for a drilling rig, was following a pilot car along Interstate 5, Hersman said. The truck driver picked up his load in Canada, and met the pilot car at the border, she said. The driver of the pilot car was to radio any obstacles the truck driver might encounter. NTSB investigators plan on interviewing the pilot car driver, she said. The truck made it across before the collapse. Repair costs . Gov. Jay Inslee estimated that it will take about $15 million to fix the bridge. He said a temporary bridge will be up within a few weeks. A permanent bridge should be ready by September, he said, according to KIRO. Inslee declared a state of emergency in Washington's northwestern counties of Skagit, Snohomish and Whatcom, noting that the highway is a major conduit and its closure -- for a ""significant period"" -- will hurt the area's economy and its residents. It's unclear how long the interstate will be closed for the bridge repairs. NTSB inspectors were expected to spend seven to 10 days investigating the crash. As part of the investigation, the NTSB will review the state's maintenance and inspection records, as well as any damage reports and repairs made to the bridge, Hersman said. 'Functionally obsolete' The bridge had been rated ""functionally obsolete,"" according to a federal database, but state officials said it was safe to drive on. That category is for bridges that may have narrow lanes or shoulders, or spans that don't provide enough vertical clearance to let tall trucks pass, according to Washington's DOT. The bridge was inspected as recently as November, transportation spokesman Chesson said. Katharine Barrett reported from Washington state, and Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Jake Carpenter and Jackie Castillo contributed to this report.","NEW: Crews begin pulling wreckage from Skagit River, a CNN affiliate reports .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The English club football season closes this weekend with one of the sport's oldest contests: the FA Cup final. The FA Cup, which was founded in 1871, is the oldest domestic association cup competition. Currently held by Premier League Portsmouth, this year's final sees Guus Hiddink's Chelsea face Everton at London's Wembley Stadium. The Football Association (FA) Cup is the world's longest-running cup competition. First contested in 1871, the competition sees teams from all professional leagues and the top amateur leagues compete in a knock-out format for the coveted prize. About 90,000 people are expected at Wembley for this year's final -- a massive change from the 2000 strong crowd which watched the first final 127 years ago. Although only contested by English and Welsh clubs, the FA Cup is hugely popular all over the world. According to the FA, the estimated global viewing audience for the 2005 final at the Millennium Stadium, where Arsenal beat Manchester United on penalties, was 484 million. That figure dwarfs the audiences for many other major sporting events. An FA spokesman told CNN the competition had such a strong following due to its history and the ""unpredictable"" nature of cup football that meant tiny amateur teams could get a shot at the big time. ""The FA Cup is the oldest football competition in the world and one that the association is very proud of. It is seen all over the world by TV viewers and is a showpiece event of the English domestic season. ""It retains a magical quality throughout the early stages because it is extremely unpredictable.  Last season only one of the four semi-final teams was from the top flight."" This year the FA Cup had a record number of 762 entries, the spokesman added. The current holder of the FA Cup is Portsmouth, however, the 2009 final is to be contested by Chelsea and Everton at Wembley Stadium this weekend. Alongside the FA Cup, the entire United Kingdom and Ireland region has a wealth of long-standing domestic cup football competitions. The Scottish Cup was formed in 1874, while the Welsh Cup has been running since 1877, and the Northern Ireland-based Irish Cup has been in action since 1881. Outside of the United Kingdom, there are a number of other prestigious domestic cup competitions. Here is a look at the world's longest-running competitions: . The oldest cup competitions outside Britain: . KNVB (Dutch) Cup, Netherlands, 1899 . The Dutch Cup involves all of the teams from the top two divisions in the Netherlands, as well as the top four sides from each of the six third-tier competitions, and further teams from the fourth tier. This year's KNVB Cup was won by Heerenveen, who defeated FC Twente on penalties to win the final. What domestic cup competition is your favorite and why? Tell us in the Sound Off box below. Copa del Rey, Spain, 1902 . Barcelona were deserving winners of this year's Copa del Rey, claiming the cup for the 25th time to establish themselves as the most successful club in the competition's history. First contested in 1902, the Copa del Rey has become one of the most-respected domestic cup competitions in the world, partly for the length of time it has run, but also due to the strength of the Spanish league. Norwegian Football Cup, Norway, 1902 . The Norwegian Football Cup, or simply ""Cupen"", is the premier knock-out competition in Norway, contested between April and November. Valerenga, a team from the city of Oslo is the current holder of the cup. Both Valerenga and Rosenberg have won the Cupen twice in the last decade. Hungarian Cup, Hungary, 1909 . First played in 1909, the Hungarian Cup, or Magyar Kupa in Hungarian, is contested by all of the professional teams in the country, as well as a number of amateur teams who must qualify through local competitions. Budapest Honved FC recently won the 2008/2009 edition of the Hungarian Cup. Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, U.S., 1914 . Open to all five levels of affiliated amateur and professional teams in the United States, the annual U.S. Open Cup is the oldest competition in U.S. soccer. This year marks the 96th time the tournament has been held, and Major League Soccer side D.C. United will be trying to defend the cup after winning it in 2008. Coupe de France, France 1918 . This season saw one of most memorable runs in the long history of the Coupe de France, as second-tier team En Avant de Guingamp marched to the title ahead of more fancied Ligue 1 opposition. It was only the second time that the cup has been won by a team outside of the top division. Top-flight side Olympique de Marseille have won the cup a record 10 times. Emperor's Cup, Japan, 1921 . The oldest football competition in Japan, the Emperor's Cup is an extremely important piece of silverware in the country as it offers entry to the Asian Champions League (ACL). Gamba Osaka won the last final, which is always contested on New Year's Day. Egypt Cup, Egypt, 1921 . This competition has been dominated by the impressive Al-Ahly club, which has won the cup 35 times. The current holder is fellow Egyptian Premier League team Haras el Hodood -- and they have now qualified for the Egyptian Super Cup match, which will see them take on league winners Al-Ahly. Taca de Portugal, Portugal, 1921 . Like the FA Cup, the major cup competition in Portuguese football will hold its final this weekend. FC Porto and Pacos Ferreira will contest the match -- which offers a Europa League place to the winner -- provided they haven't already qualified for the Champions League. Benfica have the best record in the competition, having won 27 times. Coppa Italia, Italy, 1922 . Although it was established before the Serie A league competition, the Coppa Italia doesn't seem to hold the same appeal to fans -- as many matches are played before much smaller crowds than Serie A games. The best peformers have been AS Roma and Juventus, who have both won the cup nine times. Lazio is the current holder. Chatham Cup, New Zealand, 1923 . ""New Zealand"" and ""prestigious football competitions"" aren't two terms you'd normally squeeze into the same sentence. However, the Chatham Cup, established in 1923, is among some of the oldest cup competitions in the world. It is contested by traditional club sides in the South Pacific country, rather than the franchise teams in the national league. The current holder of the Chatham Cup is East Coast Bays.","The FA Cup final between Chelsea and Everton is held this weekend .

"(CNN) -- It's not news that the national debt presents a daunting challenge. The public debt is growing faster than the economy, a trend that cannot be sustained. Even more immediately, at years' end we will face a $7 trillion fiscal cliffâ€”a series of policies will kick in, from the blunt, across the board spending cuts (or sequester) to the expiration of the tax cuts that would reduce spending and raise taxes so abruptly and mindlessly it would put us back into recession. But ignoring and waiving the policies instead would add additional trillions to the debt and set us up for a fiscal crisis. A fiscal cliff or a mountain of debt. It will require presidential leadership to avoid either threat. While the likely approach will be to replace the slated policies with a gradual debt reduction plan that would bring the deficit down and leave the debt so that it is no longer growing faster than the economy, there are many different ways to achieve this -- all with pros and cons -- and many specifics that need to be filled in. However, the tendency during campaigns, of course, is for politicians to talk about what they promise not to do, rather than own up to the tougher decisions their stewardship would require. Instead of allowing the presidential candidates to duck and bob to avoid specifically saying how they would stem the flow of red ink, what if voters insisted that all presidential candidates directly answer the question, ""how would you fix the debt?"" Quite simply, candidates should not even apply for the job of running the country if they aren't willing to share the details of their approach for fixing the debt. We should devote one of the three presidential debates to the topic of how, specifically, each candidate would change the budget, cut spending, and reform entitlement programs and the tax system to fix the debt. Candidates must debate the debt, not duck it. At the debate, each candidate would present a detailed plan of his preferred approach for reducing the deficit. Any plan should save at least $4-6 trillion over the next decade -- the amount most experts have pegged as the minimum needed to stabilize the debt -- or at the very least, a candidate should explain why his plan achieves any less. Both President Barack Obama and Gov. Mitt Romney would have a lot of fleshing out of their plans to do before this debate. Thus far, the president has only offered much smaller plans which are best described as a first step towards dealing with the problem rather than a full-blown plan, while Romney has offered a plan that could get control of the debt but with the bulk of the specifics on the spending cuts and tax breaks he would reduce, left blank, thus leaving none of the critical details filled in. In the debate, the candidates would be led through a discussion of their proposals on defense, domestic spending cuts, reforms to Social Security, Medicare, and other entitlement programs, and taxes, and make the case for their specific proposals. The plans could be scored by outside experts ahead of time so that fuzzy math wouldn't even enter the discussion. No avoiding the question, no magic asterisks, no talking about the fun parts, like lower tax rates or new investments, without the real work of detailing how they would pay for them. Voters would see beneath the hoods and assess the trade-offs of the different approaches. Certainly, either plan would not be the final word when one of the men becomes president, since it will go though many changes to achieve congressional support. But it would be the start of the conversation. It is unimaginable then that we should be asked to choose a candidate without knowing how they would serve as the country's fiscal stewards during what experts have called the most predictable and most avoidable, economic crisis in history. And with so many difficult choices to be made quickly after the election, the notion that there will be some kind of mandate for how to proceed if the candidates haven't addressed this issue head on is both highly optimistic and dangerous. The stage afforded by the fall debates is the most viable possibility for compelling the candidates to answer these tough but necessary questions. It's what they call an adult conversation, and we should give it a try.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Wednesday proposed a package of measures intended to reduce gun violence in the wake of the Newtown school massacre last month. Some of the steps have been tried before and others are expansions of laws and policies already in place. Some face high hurdles in Congress. Will they work? Here's a look at some of the key measures: . Ban on assault weapons . The Federal Assault Weapons ban, a provision of anti-crime legislation President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1994, outlawed military style semiautomatic weapons that fire one round per trigger pull and automatically eject the shell casing and reload the chamber. In addition to these weapons, the ban also limited semiautomatic rifles, semiautomatic pistols and semiautomatic shotguns that can accept a detachable magazine and have at least two military style features. Congress allowed the prohibition to expire in 2004. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said in December that she would introduce a bill to ban assault weapons. Did it work?: Two studies point to too little evidence or too little time having passed to calculate the impact of the ban. A provision in the 1994 law required the attorney general to deliver a report to Congress within 30 months of the ban evaluating its effects. The summary of that report, conducted by the National Institute of Justice, said that ""the public safety benefits of the 1994 ban have not been demonstrated."" The authors of the study suggested further tests of enforcement techniques, including ""strategic crackdowns on 'hotspots' for gun crime and strategic crackdowns on perpetrators of gun violence. The authors suggested these techniques might be ""more immediately effective, and certainly less controversial, than regulatory approaches alone."" A June 2004 University of Pennsylvania study found that the ban succeeded in reducing crimes involving assault weapons. But the benefits at the time were outweighed by increased use of non-semiautomatic weapons, which the study said were used more frequently in crime. The researchers could not credit the ban with a drop in overall gun violence over the same period. The study did point out that since assault weapons were used no more than ""8% of gun crimes, even before the ban,"" its impact was likely too small to reliably measure. Obama-backed gun bills considered a long shot in Congress . High-capacity magazines . The same 1994 anti-crime bill also banned magazines that held more than 10 rounds of ammunition. But it, too, expired after 10 years. Following a 2011 attack in Arizona that killed six people and seriously wounded former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, congressional leaders called for a ban on high-capacity magazines. The shooter in that attack used a semi-automatic pistol with a 33-round magazine. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, announced a proposal to limit high-capacity magazines. No legislation was enacted. After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Lautenberg announced plans to re-introduce legislation to ban high-capacity magazines. Other legislators are pursuing requirements for background checks on the purchase of ammunition as well as seeking to ban the online sale of ammunition. California Rep. Mike Thompson told CNN on Tuesday that a ban on high-capacity magazines could garner Republican support, but a full-scale prohibition on assault weapons would be difficult to get through the GOP-controlled House. Did it work?: The 2004 University of Pennsylvania study noted that guns with high-capacity magazines were used in up to 25% of gun crimes, but it was not clear how often the outcome of the attack depended on the capacity of the magazine. The study did note that since the rate of a shooter hitting intended victims is low in gun crimes, the ability to fire more shots more quickly increases the likelihood of a target being hit. A Washington Post analysis also found that during the10-year ban on high-capacity magazines, those seized by police in Virginia dropped during that span. When the ban was lifted in 2004, the seizures rose ""sharply."" Researchers interviewed by the Post note that the ban could have helped limit the availability of the magazines. But the Post analysis also notes that the impact of the ban is ""hard to measure."" A look at U.S. gun laws . Universal background checks . Sen. Charles Schumer, the chief supporter of legislation to impose universal background checks, calls them the ""sweet spot"" for curbing gun violence and the likelihood of getting legislation passed. U.S. law requires that any time someone buys a gun from a federally licensed gun dealer, the dealer is required to run a check on the potential buyer for possible criminal and mental issues. Records are kept by state and federal agencies. Convicted felons, people convicted of violent domestic crimes and those determined by courts to be dangerously mentally ill are prohibited by federal law from buying firearms. However, federal law does not require background checks for what are considered private transactions. And there are gaps in the existing system -- many states don't report the names of people who have been labeled dangerously mentally ill. And there are huge gaps in the database. For instance, the Virginia Tech shooter who killed 33 people in 2007 passed two background checks when buying guns because Virginia didn't submit his mentally ill status to the database. Would they work: Achieving this goal will take a combination of the executive action the president took on Wednesday and legislation to change existing laws on the requirement of background checks. Obama said Wednesday that he has taken action to address legal barriers to states sharing relevant information to the database and other measures like ensuring that physicians can ask patients about guns in their homes. The legislation Schumer is considering would encourage states to comply with sharing relevant information to the database by withholding federal funds for their law enforcement initiatives -- the federal government can't require the states to comply, but it can make it worth their while. It would also make it a crime for someone to sell a firearm without taking the buyer to a place where a background check can be performed. Enforcement would be an issue though -- it could be difficult to prove whether a firearm already on the market was sold before or after the requirement was implemented. Across the country, more than a million people failed background checks to buy guns during the past 14 years because of criminal records, drug use or mental health issues, according to FBI figures. That figure, however, is a small fraction of overall gun sales. Mental illness measures . Four of the 23 executive actions that Obama announced on Wednesday address access to mental health care through Medicare and Obamacare. Medicare is the largest provider of mental health care in the country and the Affordable Care Act opens access to millions of other Americans covered by the federal government. Another executive action was to open a national dialogue on mental health led by Health Secretary Kathleen Sibelius and Education Secretary Arne Duncan. Obama also clarified that a provision in Obamacare does not prohibit doctors from asking their patients about guns in their homes. A number of mass shootings have been committed by people known to have struggled with mental illness which has renewed calls to address mental illness in a more comprehensive manner. Federal legislation restricting access to guns for the mentally ill was firs enacted in 1968. Would it help?: A number of mental health advocacy groups came out in support of the president's announcement. The National Alliance on Mental Illness released a statement applauding the initiatives put forth from Vice President Joe Biden's task force, calling it the chance to fix the broken health care system, ""an opportunity that comes only once in a generation."" The group also supported that the president ""correctly noted"" that many of the mentally ill were not violent. NAMI expressed its hope that the attention could help fill gaps in the mental health system. FBI statistics showed about 1 percent of applicants who failed a background check were turned down for reasons related to mental health. Read Obama's proposals .","A federal assault weapons ban and ban on high-capacity magazines expired in 2004 .
Research looking at the impact of the assault weapons ban is inconclusive .
A 2007 law strengthened background checks for the mentally ill .
Universal background checks would close loopholes but could be difficult to enforce ."
"(CNN) -- Joe Biden doesn't much like the NRA -- and the feeling is mutual. But on Thursday the NRA will be coming to the White House to meet with Biden and his fast-track gun reform task force, formed after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre and due to submit its recommendations by the end of the month. There are obviously deep divisions between the two -- they are never going to agree on the vast majority of proposals, especially the assault weapons ban (despite the fact that it was once backed by Ronald Reagan) and a ban on high-capacity ammunition clips. But there may be some surprising opportunities to find common ground, even on this most contentious issue. The NRA has backed specific plans to crack down on gun violence in the past that the president could enact through executive order, and polls of NRA members suggest there is even more unexpected common ground to be found. For example, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System is an existing law that has been underfunded and insufficiently implemented. Updated after the Virginia Tech shootings, backed by the NRA and signed into law by President Bush, the law requires federally licensed gun dealers to check with a coordinated federal database to see whether the would-be gun buyer has any history of dangerous mental health problems -- as well as criminal record, arrest warrants, or orders of civil protection -- that would stop them from owning a firearm under existing law. The Virginia Tech shooter, Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people in the span of a few hours, had been previously diagnosed as mentally ill and could have been stopped from purchasing his murder weapons if the information had been available to the background check system. But since Virginia Tech, states have made only limited progress in reporting the critical mental health information, primarily because Congress has failed to provide the necessary funding, granting just 5.3% of the total authorized amount during the Obama years. Increased screening for mental health is one of the few areas the NRA agreed should be focused on in the wake of Newtown and yet the Obama administration and Congress have failed to enforce the existing law by depriving it of funds needed for implementation. Politics: How the NRA wields its influence . Likewise, the NRA has long championed Project Exile, a pilot program first implemented in Richmond, Virginia, which prosecuted serious local gun crimes committed by felons under federal law, putting repeat offenders in federal prisons far away from their communities. This get-tough approach,which inspired President Bush's national initiative Project Safe Neighborhoods, ended up cutting the ""gun carry"" rate in half and reducing the murder rate in Richmond by more than 60%. The five-year mandatory sentence for committing a crime with an illegal gun changed criminal behavior. Similar initiatives have been implemented in cities throughout the country, but the coordination has been spotty and the Obama administration has failed to follow through on the model or add innovations to it. Finally, President Obama could order the Justice Department to increase the prosecutions of people who falsify information on their gun background checks. In 2009, the FBI reported 71,000 instances of people lying on their background checks to buy guns. But the Justice Department prosecuted just 77 cases -- that's about 1/10th of 1%. A lack of follow through from the federal government is letting these gun criminals walk, and that sends a message about lack of enforcement that only encourages systematic disrespect for existing gun laws. There's a pattern here. Before the Newtown shootings, the Obama administration had not made enforcement of existing guns laws a political or policy priority as the Clinton administration did, which got it repeatedly butting heads with the NRA in the process. This may in part be connected to a political strategy implemented by then-Rep. Rahm Emanuel in 2006, when he courted pro-gun Democrats as part of a successful effort to retake control of Congress, an experience he carried with him to his role as Obama's first White House chief of staff before being elected mayor of Chicago. ""During the Clinton administration there were efforts to fully enforce the gun laws we have through innovative crime gun tracing projects, partnerships with state and local law enforcement and tough prosecution initiatives,"" said Arkadi Gerney, an adviser to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on illegal guns from 2006-11. ""So far, the Obama administration has failed to live up to that legacy and has not used its executive powers to the fullest to fight illegal guns."" But the NRA has been the prime opponent of many other new gun laws and stalled funding for many existing programs in Congress. Before drawing widespread criticism for suggesting that armed guards be placed in public schools after the Sandy Hook slaughter, the NRA had opposed seemingly common sense measures like barring individuals on the FBI terrorist watch list from buying and owning weapons. Politics: Biden's vow on curbing gun violence . Interestingly, conservative pollster Frank Luntz found that clear majorities of NRA members are more reasonable about implementing such common sense measures than their more rigidly ideological parent organization. For example, 71% of NRA members would bar people on the FBI terrorist watch list from buying and owning weapons, according to a poll Luntz conducted for the Bloomberg-backed group Mayors Against Illegal Guns. Likewise, 79% of NRA members support requiring background checks on gun retail employees, 74% would support background checks on all potential gun buyers and 64% support requiring gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms. The NRA itself has changed since the conservative movement coalesced to take over the previously sportsman-focused organization. In the 1930s, the NRA supported the U.S. ban on machine guns, which still stands. Likewise, the NRA backed the 1968 Gun Control Law passed by President Johnson after the assassinations of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy. ""Today's NRA is not that of our grandfathers,"" said Gerney. ""Unfortunately, the leadership of the NRA has turned the organization into an obstacle, rather than the partner of decades ago, in the effort to pass smart laws to keep guns away from dangerous people."" The NRA's hard turn to the right makes it highly unlikely that it will want to work with the White House on any measure. But in fact there is some common ground to be found, even between these political foes. Ironically, that common ground is likely to be found in increased federal enforcement of existing laws through executive order, the same remedy that the Drudge Report disgustingly demagogued on Wednesday by comparing executive orders by the president of the United States to tyrannical actions taken by the mass murderers Hitler and Stalin. It was a shocking reminder of just how unhinged and hateful our civic debates have become. But beyond these efforts to fear-monger for political and personal profit, the fact that some common ground exists between the White House and the NRA on gun control should be a heartening sign, a reality check amid all the overheated rhetoric. Reasoning together to solve problems should never be considered impossible in America. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: The NRA and the White House share common ground on gun control .
