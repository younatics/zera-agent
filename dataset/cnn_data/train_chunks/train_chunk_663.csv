Wanting answers: Jack Straw has demanded Met Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe explains the 'Plebgate' delays . Jack Straw last night joined growing criticism of the police inquiry into claims that serving officers conspired to bring down former Tory Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell. The former Labour Home Secretary called on ministers to demand answers from Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe over the ‘inordinate and unjustified’ delays in the Plebgate case. Mr Straw, a personal friend of Mr Mitchell, last night wrote to Home Secretary Theresa May urging her to take action in the case, in which Mr Mitchell admitted swearing at Downing Street police but denied calling them ‘plebs’. ‘No one, whatever their position, should have to suffer the toll which all this has taken on Andrew and his family. It’s high time these delays were brought to an end,’ he wrote. Scotland Yard has signallet  that its inquiry into the Plebgate affair could drag on into 2014 after it was handed new information. It revealed detectives are examining ‘three separate pieces of evidence’ passed to the force by the police watchdog and a ‘third party’. Their appearance led to senior prosecutors handing back the case file on the explosive 45 second Downing Street clash. Last night, a spokesman said ‘further inquiries’ are being made and said the complicated investigation will take ‘as long as is necessary’. The comments came shortly before the one year anniversary of the confrontation between the then Government Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell and police guards. Police stopped Mr Mitchell as he tried to cycle through the main Downing Street gates and angry words were exchanged on September 19 last year. The MP admitted swearing but denied using the word ‘pleb’, something officers recorded in an email version of events. He resigned the next month. But what began as a probe into who said what and when has grown amid claims that the senior politician was ‘stitched up’. Mr Mitchell and a close circle of supporters believe he was the victim of a deliberate and co-ordinated attempt to smear the Tory party and ruin his career. This week marks a year since Andrew Mitchell allegedly called police guarding the gates of Downing Street 'plebs' In December, CCTV footage cast doubt on the police version of events and a supposedly independent witness was apparently exposed as a fraud. The information forced the Met to reopen its inquiry as officers said they would interview all 800 members of the diplomatic protection group. Since then Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has given a limited apology to the Mr Mitchell, saying he was sorry if his confidence in the inquiry has been damaged. The top police officer is accused of undermining the judicial process by effectively exonerating the officers guarding Downing Street. In the weeks after the incident he said he had no reason not to believe what they said happened took place. Overall, eight people, including five police officers, have been arrested for offences including misconduct in a public office and leaking information as part of Operation Alice. A separate inquiry, by West Mercia . Police, is examining the conduct of Police Federation representatives . who held a meeting with Mr Mitchell. Both . inquiries are being overseen by the Independent Police Complaints . Commission (IPCC), which passed on some of the new evidence. Since evidence of a possible 'stitch up' came to light Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has given a limited apology to the Mr Mitchell, saying he was sorry if his confidence in the inquiry has been damaged . Scotland Yard has endured repeated criticism of the slow pace of its inquiry, which has left both the officers involved and Mr Mitchell in limbo. The Met spokesman said: ‘Operation Alice has been ongoing since it was re-opened in December 2012 following fresh information. ‘This investigation is examining very serious allegations, that go to the heart of the public’s trust in the police service. ‘The Met is conducting a thorough investigation that aims to establish the truth of what has taken place and find the best possible evidence. ‘An initial file was passed to the CPS in March 2013, however since that time three separate pieces of information have been given to us. ‘As a result further inquiries have had to be made. ‘The investigation is being conducted with oversight from the IPCC. This complicated inquiry will go where the evidence takes us, and will take as long as is necessary. ‘As this is an ongoing investigation we cannot provide details at this stage, however we can confirm that three separate pieces of information have been provided to police via the IPCC and a third party.’ Operation Alice, which has involved a team of more than 30 detectives, is believed to have cost more than £250,000.

Jailed: Jack Watchorn, nicknamed the 'Creeper, has been sentenced to 30 months in prison . A teenage girl was stalked and kidnapped by a 6ft 6 giant nicknamed the 'Creeper' as she walked home alone for the first time. The petite girl, 17, who is just 5ft tall, was just yards from her front door when she was grabbed from behind and dragged into an alleyway by 22-year-old Jack Watchorn. Bespectacled Watchorn, who had begun following the girl late at night after she left her friend's house, clamped his hand over her mouth and pulled her backwards in what a female judge branded an attack 'every woman dreads'. He then hit her in the face before fleeing from the alleyway in Blackpool, Lancashire. Passers by heard the teenager's screams, before finding her hysterical, crying: 'some sicko has just hit me.' The girl - who cannot be named for legal reasons - was so traumatised by the abduction she now now fears going out at night. She also has nightmares about men wearing glasses bursting through her bedroom window. Watchorn, who is taking part in a scheme with The Prince's Trust, was jailed for 30 months for kidnap at Preston Crown Court. The court heard that the girl had been at a friend’s house before making her way home alone at 10pm on January 20 this year. She was just yards from her front door when Watchorn - who moved to the UK from native Galway in Ireland - ran across the road towards her. Scene: Watchorn, 22, grabbed his 17-year-old victim as she was walking along this street in Blackpool, Lancashire (pictured), before dragging her into an alleyway and hitting her . Roger Brown, prosecuting, said: 'What is important, having watched the video of the way in which the defendant followed the young woman, is that he is gradually catching up with her. 'She turns off the main road and the defendant runs across the road and takes hold of her.' CCTV footage captured the moment Watchorn clamped his hand over the young woman's mouth, before dragging her into the alleyway. He then ran off to a nearby pizza parlour and was arrested eight days later. The victim, who is undergoing counselling, said in a statement that her social life had suffered and she constantly looks over her shoulder. She added: 'I wish it had never happened, I think about it every day.' The court heard that Watchorn of Bond Street, Blackpool, had convictions for theft, threatening and abusive behaviour and being intoxicated in a public place between 2008 and 2010. Nightmare: CCTV footage captured the moment Watchorn clamped his hand over the young girl's mouth and pulled her backwards in what a female judge branded a moment 'every woman dreads' Philip Andrews, defending, said: 'He pursued her, effectively stalked her over a considerable distance and over a number of minutes. He is 6ft 6 and she is only about 5ft. 'He was extremely drunk and behaved badly towards this girl and put her in a very frightening situation. 'It couldn’t have lasted more than four or five seconds at the absolute most. He came across this young woman, behaved the way he did, she screamed and he let go.' Sentencing Watchorn to 30 months in prison, Judge Heather Lloyd said: 'It is very rare for a woman to be taken and abducted in the street by a total stranger, she will have been extremely frightened, it is what every woman dreads and she is no exception. 'She said she thought she was going to die and didn’t want to think what you were going to do to her. She has been left scared and will not go out on her own.' Speaking afterwards. the victim's mother said: 'It was the first time she had ever walked home on her own and she tried to keep to the main roads to be safe, until the last moment. She wasn’t far from home at all. 'I would have obviously liked him to get longer as any mother would. She is serving a life sentence so why shouldn’t he.'

Scientists are developing a ‘teardrop’ test that could help identify people in the early stages of Parkinson’s. Powerful MRI scans reveal that patients with the disease do not have a distinctive teardrop mark in their brains like healthy people. The discovery could help doctors diagnose the degenerative brain disorder, track its progress and monitor whether drugs are working. Comedian Billy Connolly revealed this week that he is in the early stages of Parkinson’s disease, which affects 127,000 Britons mostly aged 60 and over. The condition destroys brain cells producing the chemical messenger dopamine in the part of the brain that controls movement. As well as affecting movement, it can cause memory problems. Researchers at Nottingham University and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust believe they have found a biological marker that shows the presence of the disease in the brain. Using imaging techniques, they compared the brains of Parkinson’s patients with those of healthy people, focusing on nigrosomes, clusters of dopamine-rich cells in a particular part of the brain. The findings, published in the journal Neurology, showed that a telltale teardrop mark in the brains of healthy people was missing in Parkinson’s sufferers. Professor Penny Gowland, who is based at the University’s Sir Peter Mansfield Magnetic Resonance Centre, said the mark showed up under an extremely powerful 7T MRI scanner. ‘This was a breakthrough discovery in that we now know that using this particular MRI scanner, we can see that patients living with Parkinson’s disease don’t have this particular feature in their brain,’ she said. Comedian and actor Billy Connolly revealed this week that he is in the early stages of Parkinson's disease . She added that there is a need for imaging tracking to monitor the progression of the disease and allow for the development of neuroprotective drugs. Researchers plan to develop a test that could be adapted to standard MRI scans. Professor Gowland said: ‘We are now conducting a study of patients with Parkinson’s to ascertain when this mark actually disappears, which could potentially have huge implications for early diagnosis of the illness, and subsequently how it is treated.’","The discovery could help doctors diagnose the degenerative brain disorder .

Down in the mouth: Sad Toto has lived alone since his partner Topsy died, but is too old to live with anyone else . A zoo which was inundated with visitors worried about their lonely-looking chimp has had to put a sign up to reassure guests that he is just missing his mate. Families with young children visiting Drayton Manor Theme Park and Zoo, in Tamworth, Staffordshire, have been worried that chimpanzee Toto might be severely unwell. But keepers have insisted the glum-looking ape is suffering from a broken heart after his life-partner Topsy died of natural causes seven years ago. The pair were said to have been inseparable after spending 45 years together at the zoo since they arrived within a year of each other in 1968 and 1969. After Topsy died, staff at the zoo looked into pairing up her dejected partner with another chimp, but were advised by primate specialists that he would be better off staying in the home he had known for so long. A zoo spokesman said: 'We decided that rather than attempt to . introduce him to a new group, the best course of action for Toto was to . remain at Drayton Manor Zoo, the only home he has ever known, in the . care of keepers who know and love him.' He said Topsy lived alone because it would not be safe to introduce a single, elderly animal into a new group. A sign has now been erected outside Toto’s enclosure informing zoo visitors of the reasons behind the grieving 47-year-old’s downcast demeanour. It explains why the zoo took the decision to keep Toto in an enclosure by himself, saying: 'We took the decision to let him live . out his remaining days here in the place he knew well with the staff . who had looked after him from a youngster. Toto lived with his mate Topsy (pictured) from 1969 until she died in 2005. Since then he has lived alone . 'We . did not feel trying to introduce a new partner was the the answer, as . when he eventually dies we would be left in the same situation. 'We . fully understand that not everyone agrees with our decision, but we . stand by it and have the support of our licensing authority and zoo . inspectors. Today families visiting the zoo said they were sad to learn why the chimp looks so down in the mouth. 'Not an easy decision to make': Staff at the zoo have put up a sign to explain why the sad chimp is alone . Toto and Topsy would preen each other and share their toys and beds in their joint enclosure . Hannah Wildman, 30, who was with her daughter Aimee, five, said: 'While it’s good to hear that he is not seriously ill, the story behind his depression is still absolutely heartbreaking. 'His eyes look tinged with sadness - he looks really down in the dumps.' Louise Cartwright, 30, who had taken her niece Sabrina, seven, to the theme park, added: 'You’ve got to feel sorry for old Toto. He looks so glum.' The zoo spokesman said keepers were told to make a special effort to keep Toto from dwelling on his sadness, coming up with games and activities to keep him busy.. Head keeper Alan Carter, who has looked after Toto for 30 years, said: 'Toto and Topsy used to preen each other a lot, share toys and beds - they were in the same enclosure together.","Toto the chimp, 47, lived with Topsy from 1969 til she died eight years ago .

"By . Mark Duell . PUBLISHED: . 12:02 EST, 19 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:02 EST, 19 September 2013 . 'Robbed from her mother': Anabelle Shepherd died from a serious infection on Christmas Day 2012 . A mother told an inquest today she was robbed of her 22-month-old daughter because hospital staff had not done enough to treat the transplant patient before she died of an infection. Leanne Shepherd and her husband Lee heavily criticised staff at Portsmouth’s Queen Alexandra Hospital for the care of Anabelle, who was admitted just before Christmas last year. Anabelle, from Portsmouth, had been diagnosed with the rare genetic condition Hurler’s Syndrome, but was progressing well under the care of Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. She had a bone marrow transplant at GOSH to cure the condition, which showed signs of success. Before Christmas however she was lethargic and was taken to QAH by her parents. But her condition worsened and when she had a seizure she was moved to intensive care at Southampton General Hospital, where she died from a serious infection on Christmas Day, despite attempts to stabilise her condition. Managers at the QAH have changed their protocols of dealing with immuno-suppressed children in the light of Anabelle’s death and the hospital has apologised for some of the care the toddler received, the hearing was told. Mr and Mrs Shepherd had been looking after Anabelle at home for months and were concerned about infection because she was taking drugs to suppress her immune system after the transplant in August last year. When she became ill, Mrs Shepherd was told by GOSH to take her to QAH. Treatment Lee and Leanne Shepherd heavily criticised staff at Portsmouth¿s Queen Alexandra Hospital (pictured) for the care of 22-month-old Anabelle, who was admitted just before Christmas last year . She accused the hospital of a ‘lack of care and action’ and she and her husband Lee were concerned about a lack of medical intervention and assessment as their daughter’s condition worsened over December 23 and 24. She explained she had disagreed with the diagnosis of gastroenteritis and asked medical staff to note it. Mr Shepherd said that the decision to give Anabelle oral antibiotics, which she threw up, when an intravenous dose would have been better could not be discussed because the doctor had to rush off for an emergency. It was not until later when Anabelle had become very ill that IV antibiotics were administered and blood tests and cultures taken. Awful time: Leanne, 38, and Lee Shepherd, 43, are pictured outside the inquest in Southampton today . There were also hours of delays between blood tests coming back and visits from doctors, the inquest heard. ‘I felt I had to prompt the nursing staff to do what I considered to be basic care for an immuno-suppressed child,’ Mr Shepherd’s statement said. ‘I feel completely let down by QA and that no-one took what we said seriously.’ Mrs Shepherd said she had been in complete shock and was sick when her daughter’s condition started to deteriorate and medical staff and machines went into the room. ‘I feel let down, frustrated and angry at the treatment we received at QA. The level of care, particularly on December 24, was below standard. ‘It seems to be that everything was done reactively and I believe this potentially resulted in her death. ‘I feel that Anabelle was badly let down by her home town and we were robbed of our daughter.’ She said the family had been ‘completely crushed’ by the death. ‘Our lives and hearts have a hole that will never be filled,’ she added. Mr Shepherd said that doctors at Southampton had been frustrated at the care Anabelle received at Portsmouth and he said that one medic had called it a ‘calamity’. ‘We are absolutely heartbroken and distraught by Anabelle’s death, and not a moment goes by without the thought of seeing her little face again,’ he said. A post-mortem examination could not identify what was the infection that caused Anabelle’s death and whether it was viral or bacterial, the inquest heard. Consultant paediatrician Simon Birch, who looked after Anabelle for some of her time at QA, said that in retrospect there had been a lack of communication with the parents when she was admitted but he said a lot was done to treat her even though she could have been seen more regularly. 'I feel that Anabelle was badly let down by her home town and we were robbed of our daughter' Leanne Shepherd . ‘Although we are still not certain it would have altered the outcome, we fully acknowledge it would have given more clarity to Anabelle’s care,’ he said. He said staff had recognised she was immuno-suppressed otherwise he may not have seen her and she might well have been discharged as would have happened with a healthy child. He said there had been a lack of communication in part because it was unusual for Anabelle not to be known to the hospital. Staff at QAH did consult with Great Ormond Street when Anabelle was admitted, the hearing was told. He said that there were no protocols to deal with a child like Anabelle and her condition at the time and he admitted there was a gap in the process that had now been filled. He said it would have been better with a immuno-suppressed child like Anabelle for medics to have made the presumption of infection and prescribed a wide-ranging IV antibiotic. 'We are absolutely heartbroken and distraught by Anabelle’s death, and not a moment goes by without the thought of seeing her little face again' Lee Shepherd . ‘The lesson we learn is that presumption should not be based on a ready to take action at the first sign of deterioration, it should be automatic and follow a certain procedure and reduce down from that,’ he told the hearing. He explained that now blood and cultures were taken and IV antibiotics administered on children in similar positions to Anabelle within one hour of admission with more frequent observations. Hurler’s syndrome affects one in 117,000 children. Sufferers are missing an enzyme and without treatment it means that complex sugars accumulate within the body’s tissues, causing damage to them. An effective treatment is now available which involves a bone marrow transplant so that the new marrow can make the missing enzyme otherwise the condition is fatal by the time a child is 15. Southampton coroner Keith Wiseman will give a narrative verdict at a later date.","Leanne and Lee Shepherd strongly criticise staff at Portsmouth hospital .

"Judge ruled the decision was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution . Child is now called Messiah DeShawn McCollough . By . Daily Mail Reporter .

A Tennessee judge reversed a ruling today for an eight-month-old boy's name to be changed from Messiah to Martin. Child Support Magistrate Lu Ann Ballew had ordered the boy's name to be changed to Martin because of the religious connection to Messiah, but his mother Jaleesa Martin appealed the decision. Messiah's parents had gone to court originally because they couldn't agree on their son's last name, but instead the judge took a dislike to the first name and kept both mother and father's last names. Jawaan McCullough, left, and Jaleesa Martin, center, and lawyer Kristi Davis speak during interviews following an appeal hearing regarding their son's name at Cocke County Chancery Court in Tennessee today . Mother Jalessa Martin (pictured) is over the moon about her baby boy keeping his name as Messiah . 'The word 'Messiah' is a title, and . it's a title that has only been earned by one person - and that one . person is Jesus Christ', Ballew said. But . today Chancellor Telford E. Forgety Jr. ruled that the court had acted . unconstitutionally and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, USA Today reported. Jeleesa . Martin appealed the ruling under grounds it was unconstitutional and . that she and the father had arrived at court to discuss their son's last . name. She said: 'I was . shocked. I never intended on naming my son Messiah because it means God . and I didn't think a judge could make me change my baby's name because . of her religious beliefs'. The boy is now officially called Messiah DeShawn McCollough.

According . to a brief, in the magistrate's written findings 'the section . regarding the child's name was originally filled out but then appears to . have been whited out, with the magistrate then writing that the child's . name is 'reserved until further hearing'.' The youngster, Messiah, has no idea about the struggle to keep his name . Ballew . called a second hearing on Aug. 8, where she changed the baby's name to . Martin McCullough, although neither parent had requested the change. In the new written findings, Ballew explained the change by saying that the name Messiah was not in the child's best interest. 'Messiah' means Savior, Deliverer, the One who will restore God's Kingdom. 'Messiah' is a title that is held only by Jesus Christ,' she wrote. Ballew further stated that 'it is highly likely that he will offend many Cocke County citizens by calling himself 'Messiah'.' The . mother's two other children are called Micah and Mason and she argued . that she wanted to name her third child with an M too. Messiah is ranked 387th most popular baby name according to the Social Security Administration's 2012 list of names. A WBIR reporter asked the judge in August what she thought about all the children named Jesus. 'Well, I thought about that,' she responded. 'That's not relevant to this case.' Martin was amazed a judge could force her to change her son's name because of their own religion. 'I . was shocked. I never intended on naming my son Messiah because it means . God and I didn't think a judge could make me change my baby's name . because of her religious beliefs.' The U.S. does not currently legislate baby name choices, therefore Jaleesa Martin has not changed her baby's name yet.","Judge ruled the decision was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution .

Decision: Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke announced that the progression towards a stronger economy is taking longer than originally expected . Wall Street had their best day hitting record highs on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve announced that they would continue to support the economy by keeping interest rates high and buying billions of government bonds. American stocks jumped as a result with . traders predicting that the fact that the central bank will  continue . pumping $85billion into the economy every month could lead to inflation. The announcement of the continued financial support came as a major surprise, as many believed the Fed would begin winding down their emergency measures that were initially launched five years ago during the financial collapse. Fed chairman Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday that wanted to wait for more evidence of solid economic growth before beginning to reduce the country’s bond purchases. He went out of his way to stress the program was 'not on a pre-set course’ even though in June he had said the Fed expected to cut back before year end. 'There is no fixed calendar schedule. I really have to emphasize that,' he told a news conference. ‘If the data confirm our basic outlook, if we gain more confidence in that outlook ... then we could move later this year.' The reaction in markets was swift and sharp: the U.S. dollar fell to a seven-month low against major currencies and the price of gold, a traditional inflation hedge, soared more than 4.0 per cent and investors responded by propelling U.S. stocks to record highs and driving down bond yields. Yields on U.S. Treasury debt had risen over the summer on expectations the Fed would cut back its $85billion a month in bond purchases that have been the cornerstone of its efforts to spur the economy. Share price rise: U.S. S&P500 index shot up 15.66 points to 1720.42, the highest level in its history and the Dow Jones rose 108.09 to a record 15,637.82 . Some economists said it was possible the . Fed might not begin to wind down its bond buying until after Bernanke's . term as Fed chairman expires in January. Her task: Janet Yellen is seen to be the frontrunner in the fight to take over from Bernanke when he leaves in January . That would leave the tricky task of . unwinding the stimulus to his successor, quite possibly Fed Vice Chair . Janet Yellen who was identified by a White House official on Wednesday . as the front-runner for the job. Bernanke declined to comment on his own future, beyond saying he hoped to have more information soon. Bernanke . had stated in June that officials expected to begin slowing the pace of . bond purchases later this year and would likely end the program by . mid-2014, at which point the central bank forecast the unemployment rate . would be around 7.0 per cent. In . his statement on Wednesday, he said a jobless rate of 7.0 per cent was . not a 'magic number' that would govern when the Fed would turn off the . monetary spigot. 'We could . begin later this year. But even if we do that, the subsequent steps will . be dependent on continued progress in the economy,' Bernanke said. 'We don't have a fixed calendar schedule. But we do have the same basic framework that I described in June.'","Chairman of US Federal Reserve says that it isn't time to stop using the emergency measures put in place during the financial collapse .

Scotland Yard has seen a leap in the number of people reporting online abuse and bullying -  and the figures are set to rise, a senior police officer said today. It comes after a number of high profile online 'Twitter trolling' bullying cases, where users of the site are bombarded with threats and abuse, many involving celebrities. Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey told members of the Greater London Assembly that the force has seen a rise in crimes linked to online harassment and bullying. Around 1,500 additional crimes linked to online abuse are being reported to Scotland Yard per year and the number looks set to rise, a senior police officer said today . Mr Mackey said: 'We're seeing about 1,500 additional offences reported to us per year. Under Section 127 of the . Communications Act 2003 it is an offence to ‘send by means of a public . electronic communications network a message or other matter that is . grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character’. Offenders convicted under Section 127 of the 2003 Communications Act can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to £5,000. 'I think it will rise as people become more aware of this.' Investigators face difficulties including many social media companies being based in the US, where laws are different; the difficulty of providing legally robust evidence for court cases and trolls using false identities or software to cover their IP address, he said. This follows torrents of abuse that were directed at a number of high profile women on Twitter. It began with feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, from north London, who was subjected to a string of violent and obscene messages after she was involved in a campaign to have a woman's picture printed on a new banknote.Earlier this month she complained that she had been made to trawl through the abuse to provide evidence for police. She said: 'It's just appalling. I got an email saying 'why don't you go through what you've had' from three users with certain handles. It just shows such insensitivity to someone who's been through so much.' In July, historian Mary Beard got her own back on Twitter trolls after using the site to name and shame a student posting vile abuse on her profile . Today Mr Mackey said that the force has investigators who could have looked through the material. He said: 'I don't know why she went back through each and every one.' Ms Caroline Criado-Perez has since closed her account on the social networking site. She . was subjected to abuse along with Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy who was . targeted after she offered support to the freelance journalist. Classicist . and television historian Professor Mary Beard, Guardian columnist . Hadley Freeman, Independent columnist Grace Dent and Europe editor of . Time magazine Catherine Mayer were also among those who received . threatening messages. Since then, Twitter has introduced a 'report Tweet' button. In . July, historian Mary Beard got her own back on Twitter trolls after . using the site to name and shame a student posting vile abuse on her . profile . Ms Beard retweeted – or forwarded – to her thousands of followers a message from Oliver Rawlings in which he called her a ‘filthy old s***’ with a revolting sexual comment. It prompted a flurry of online support for the 58-year-old TV presenter – including an offer from one of her 42,000 followers to pass on the home address of her abuser’s mother. Last . year classical singer Katherine Jenkins faced death threats on Twitter . while prosecutors decided not to take action against a footballer who . posted an abusive message about Olympic swimmer Tom Daley .

Offenders convicted under Section 127 of the 2003 Communications Act can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to £5,000. Trolls can also be charged if, for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety to another, they send an electronic message which they know is false. In 2010, Colm Coss, from Manchester, was jailed for 18 weeks under Section 127 after posting obscene messages on Facebook tribute sites, including one for former Big Brother star Jade Goody. Last year Matthew Woods, 19, from Chorley, Lancashire, was jailed for 18 weeks after posting explicit comments and jokes about April and Madeleine McCann.

Nick Clegg, pictured with his wife Miriam, sought to paint himself as an ordinary working husband during his speech . During his speech yesterday, Nick Clegg sought to paint himself as an ordinary working husband and family man. Rather than moving to ‘live behind the Government battlements in Whitehall’ to carry out his role as Deputy Prime Minister, he was keen to highlight that he lives in the same house he has always done. The 46-year-old Lib Dem leader was rather less forthcoming, however, about the fact his luxurious home also happens to be in one of London’s most sought-after areas. He further tried to underline his ‘ordinary man’ credentials by hinting that he would quit within the next few years. In a bid to convince voters that he is a normal person who is not obsessed by politics, he announced that he ‘will not be in politics forever’ so he can be ‘a father, a husband, a son, an uncle to all those I love’. Despite having made much of his past pledges not to use his family to score points with voters, Mr Clegg repeatedly told anecdotes about his three sons, Antonio, 11, Alberto, eight, and Miguel, four. He also boasted that unlike David Cameron, who lives in Downing Street, he and his wife Miriam had kept their family in Putney, South West London. He said: ‘Miriam and I chose not to live behind the Government battlements in Whitehall. We try very hard to keep our family life normal and private – we keep our children away from the cameras. ‘We don’t pretend we’re a model family – we are who we are. We try to make sure Westminster doesn’t take over our lives.’ Unlike the other parties, he also declared, Lib Dems ‘speak like humans’. He also joked about demands by Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott, an ally of Vince Cable, that he resign as leader. The Clegg's £1.5million townhouse in South West London - just a stone's throw from the Thames waterfront . ‘I won’t be in politics forever. Matthew Oakeshott will be relieved. Only three or four elections to go,’ he said. Aides said Mr Clegg would serve as party leader ‘up to, including and beyond the next general election’. However, many think he will walk away from frontline politics if he does not succeed in taking the Lib Dems into government again. Mr Clegg conceded: ‘My upbringing was privileged: Home Counties; private school; Cambridge University. I had a lot of opportunities. The Liberal Democrat leader told his party that he would not be in politics forever . 'But I also had two parents who were determined that my brothers, my sister and I knew how lucky we were.’ Mr Clegg, who has previously attacked journalists who ask questions about his children’s schooling, then went on to tell how he and his wife use their summer trips to her home town in Spain to educate their sons about the political exploits of her father Jose Antonio Gonzalez Caviedes, a conservative senator who died in 1996. ‘Miriam tells them of the wonderful things he did. 'We teach them – just as my parents taught me – that rights and values should never be taken for granted, and if you believe in them, you should stand up for them.’ The Cleggs also have use of Chevening, in Kent - a 115-room grace-in-favour mansion . It may well be, as Nick Clegg was keen to point out, the same old family home he was living in before he become Deputy Prime Minister. But it is one most of us can only ever dream of. The £1.5million home is in Putney, South West London, a rapidly-rising property hotspot and a stone’s throw from the picturesque Thames waterfront. But whenever Mr Clegg and his wife and sons feel like a change of scene, they have plenty of options. In winter, they have the run of his mother’s £7million, luxury 20-room mountain chalet near the exclusive Swiss resort of Klosters. Meanwhile, his father’s ten-bedroom chateau near Bordeaux, in France, provides an idyllic summer escape. Then there is the grace-and-favour 115-room mansion, Chevening, in Kent, where the Cleggs entertain guests. While Mr Clegg’s £134,565 salary sounds more than comfortable to most mere mortals, it is dwarfed by his Spanish-born wife’s estimated £600,000 a year income as a commercial lawyer at the major US law firm Dechert. The daughter of a Madrid senator, she is also a director of a Spanish building company. Mr Clegg himself was raised in luxury in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, going to £19,000-a-year Caldicott prep school and then Westminster School. His maternal grandfather was a friend of the Dutch royal family and his banker father, Nicholas, is the son of a Russian-born baroness.","Nick Clegg tried to show he is ordinary working husband during Conference .

A pet owner who kept 10 cats in some of the worst conditions an RSPCA inspector has ever seen has been banned from keeping animals for life. Police officers and the RSPCA found the flea-infested cats in Jayne Gibson's Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, home in August last year. The 46-year-old's home was described as being in such a squalid state that it was 'unfit for humans let alone animals'. Banned: Jayne Gibson has been banned for keeping animals for life after keeping 10 flea infested cats in squalid conditions . Squalor: Conditions at Jayne Gibson's house were among the worst that RSPCA inspectors and police had ever seen . As well as nine surviving cats, a 10th pet was found dead and had been thrown into a box in the house. Magistrates at North Staffordshire Justice Centre heard that the cats had been living in their own filth inside the house which had hundreds of flies buzzing around when inspectors arrived. RSPCA Inspector Penny Baker said: 'I can categorically say this was the worst house I have been in during my entire career with the society.' A police officer told the court it was one of the worst cases of animal cruelty they have ever dealt with. Flea infested: A police officer who attended Gibson's house had to burn his uniform after the visit . The court heard that nine cats were rescued and later treated by a vet - some had scabs on their bodies due to a flea infestation, some had suffered hair loss, and one had cat flu. The police officer said: 'I have never been in a house in such a state. It was difficult to describe the true extent of the situation. His uniform had to be burned after visiting the house. Claire Aldridge, prosecuting, said: 'As the RSPCA inspector approached the house, neighbours had voiced their concerns about the number of cats there. 'And the vet who treated the cats described the flea infestation on the animals as exceptional.' But Simon Davies defending denied that her cruelty was deliberate and said that the situation had got out of hand when she began taking in stray cats. He said: 'This was not a deliberate act. She often went without food herself so that the cats could eat, but things got out of hand. 'She has kept animals for years but has never come to the notice of the court. She has signed the cats over to the RSPCA for re-homing.' Gibson pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary cruelty to cats. She also admitted a third offence of failing to ensure animals in her care were provided with a suitable hygienic environment. She was given a 12-month community order with supervision, ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work and told she must also pay £240 costs.

A couple has won the right to use the trademark Golden Balls for their company after a six-year legal battle that went to the European Court of Justice. Businessman Gus Bodur, 50, and his wife Inez, 49, have been forced to shell out more than £100,000 in legal fees since the FIFA Ballon d'Or - a globally recognised accolade given to the world's best footballer - claimed the name of their sportswear shop was a copyright infringement. The prize has been given annually since 2010, when France Football's Ballon d'Or and the men's FIFA World Player of the Year award merged, and has been won by Barcelona's Lionel Messi every year since. Family business: Inez and Gus Bodur with Golden Balls products in 2009 outside their West Hampstead store before they were forced to close in 2010 . The Bodurs, from Cricklewood in . north-west London, were forced to close their store in West Hapstead, . north London, in 2010 after the expense of the case - and the sleepless . nights - became too much for the small business to cope with. But they say they are delighted with the ruling from Europe's highest court, which will allow them to trade again under their original name. Mrs Bodur said: 'After the hearing, we were crying, laughing and jumping around. 'We have been waiting so long for this day and we felt so relieved that the judges were saying what we have been saying since day one - that there was no similarity.' Mr Bodur said: 'We are still in shock. We thought all along that we were right but these large corporations . have so much money, you don't know.' The . couple, who have two children, have been selling their sportswear since . 2001, when they obtained the trademark for Golden Balls. Hollywood star Gwyneth Paltrow was spotted out in Covent Garden in 2002 wearing one of their T-shirts as business boomed. Golden: Left, Lionel Messi, who has won the Ballon d'Or for four years in a row, and right, Gwyneth Paltrow wearing a t-shirt made by the Bodurs' company in 2002 . When Victoria Beckham revealed her nickname for her husband David was 'Golden Balls', they wrote to the Beckhams to check there were no legal issues, and had no problems. But when they licensed the name to entertainment company Endemol to use for a game show hosted by TV comedian Jasper Carrott in 2007, they were contacted by organisers of the Ballon d'Or - French for 'Ball of Gold'. The show was shelved as award organisers Intra-presse accused the Bodurs of infringing copyright. The two entrepreneurs claimed victory in the European trademark disputes court in 2010. But an appeal granted some rights back to the organisers, who merged with FIFA that same year. The defiant Bodurs, however, vowed to take the case all the way to the Court of Justice, bankrolling their fight with money from their licensing deal with Endemol. Mrs Bodur said: 'The next stage is to get our legal fees paid and to get compensation for the loss of business and for what our family has gone through in the last six years.' The couple, who have been receiving some royalties from the online version of the TV show Golden Balls, now hope a new series will be launched. They say they have plans to open a new sports cafe selling Golden Balls merchandise.","Gus and Inez Bodur founded sportswear company Golden Balls in 2001 .

The end of the summer holidays may be a cause for celebration for some beleaguered parents while for stressed out teachers it may be a reason to turn to the bottle. But either way, the rows of bottles of alcohol on display at a Tesco store in Swansea certainly weren't meant for school children.

Licking his wounds: Eric Simmons, 42, who tried to leap from a moving police car after he was arrested on suspicion of a burglary two days earlier . A suspected burglar has been left licking his wounds and counting the charges after leaping head-first from a moving police cruiser in an attempt to escape arrest. Uncuffed Eric Simmons, 42, skidded along the tarmac after reaching outside the open back seat window, unlatching the door and hurling himself onto the street in Dayton, Ohio. But he didn't get very far. Footage from the car's camera shows how before Simmons was even able to make it to his feet officers had stopped the car, jumped out and cuffed him tightly. He now adds a felony escape charge to the string of alleged offences he is suspected of committing. A mugshot shows he also suffered a painful-looking graze to the side of his head. And the officers involved in the incident now face awkward questions. 'He was supposed to be in handcuffs, the window should not have been down,' said Dayton Police Assistant Chief Bob Chabali. One of the arresting officers, Douglas Gresham had recently graduated from the academy. He was working alongside veteran officer Adam Sharp, the assistant chief told ABC News. 'Obviously, there are some clear violations that officers are involved in so we are reviewing all the video information and there will be discipline generated out of this,' he added. Officers Gresham and Sharp had been transporting Simmons to the police station after arresting him over an earlier burglary when he made his audacious escape attempt on August 29. Their car was travelling about 15 to 20mph when the suspect took his chance. Worth a try... This still from the police car's 'cruiser-cam' shows Simmons as he reaches towards the door .

Back in custody: Officers Gresham and Sharp quickly stop their car and leap out to put Simmons in handcuffs . Assistant Chief Chabali said that suspects should always be cuffed when in the back of a police car. Simmons, in particular, was considered a dangerous suspect with a criminal past. Just two days earlier an officer had fired a shot at Simmons as he fled the scene of a burglary in a pick up truck. The suspect had reached under his seat and the officer, fearing he may have been reaching for a gun, opened fire but missed.

A drawing by a pre-Raphaelite master worth £50,000 has been discovered hanging in the landing of a country house. The picture, by founder 19th century movement Dante Gabriel Rossetti, has hung unknown on a wall until it was discovered by chance. The owners, who have asked not to be named, had no idea what the work of an unremarkable female model was or who it was by until they invited an auctioneer round to value some silver. Master: The previously unknown drawing by pre-Raphaelite master Dante Gabriel Rossetti is expected to fetch £50,000 at auction. Eagle-eyed expert Guy Schwinge spotted the 16ins by 13ins framed drawing at the top of the stairs of the property and suspected it may have been a Rossetti. He then consulted leading Rossetti expert Christopher Newell and he has confirmed it to be an original work of the celebrated English artist. It is not a previously-recorded work by the Rossetti. The drawing, in coloured chalks, will now be sold at auction with a pre-sale estimate of 50,000 pounds. The woman in the drawing is Alexa Wilding, who was one of Rossetti's favourite models. She was paid a retaining fee by him on the agreement that she sat exclusively for him. Mr Schwinge, of Duke's Auctioneers of Dorchester, Dorset, said: ""I was called out to value some silver at a country house in the Home Counties. ""I chanced upon it as I climbed the stairs. It was at the top, hanging on a wall on the landing. ""It was a powerful drawing which immediately shouted out Rossetti. ""The client allowed me to take it away for further research and I contacted Christopher Newell who confirmed it from the style and execution and from who the sitter was. ""It is neither dated nor previously recorded and it appears to be a preparatory sketch for a bigger work. For sale: The picture, held by Amy Brenan from Duke's Auctioneers, above is expected to fetch £50,000 when it is sold on September 26 . ""When I told my clients they were naturally very pleased. There is lots of excitement in it from collectors interested in the pre-Raphaelite movement.""The chalk drawing shows Alexa Wilding with her face turned to the left. Her eyes are a clear blue and her lips and skin seen as a rosy complexion. Rossetti had bumped into an 18-year-old Alexa as she walked down the Strand in London in 1865. He persuaded her to model for him and within a year he had embarked on the series of paintings of her which are exhibited in museums today. Art historian Mr Newell said: ""It is immediately recognisable as a Rossetti. It is the type of drawing that he made and of a model who was familiar to him. ""It is typical of his work. Parts of it are highly worked textures while other parts are just blocked in or left blank."" The owners, who are descendants of a patron of Ressetti, were said to be 'very pleased' with the discovery. It will be sold by Duke's on September 26.","Original artist was previously unknown .

But on Wednesday, authorities announced Perez is in good health and with her family and that two men were in custody in connection to her terrifying ordeal. Scroll down for video... 'She's safe!': Home invaders stole Ayvani Hope Perez, 14, away from her family Tuesday. The teen was returned to her family safe and sound Wednesday . 'She is safe,' Clayton County Police Chief Gregory Porter announced as he kicked off a joyous, albeit brief, press conference, surrounded by members of the FBI, Georgia Bureau of Investigation, district attorney's office, and even Homeland Security. But because the investigation is ongoing, Porter refused to say how exactly--whether it was driving in a car or locked inside a home-- Perez spent the last day and a half. 'She was recovered at a location in Conyers, Georgia,' Porter said. 'The investigation is still active.' According FBI agent Rick Maxwell, two suspects have been apprehended in connection to the case. One man, Will Jackson, 29, of Atlanta has been charged with conspiracy to kidnap. The other, a Mexican national named Juan Alberto Rodriguez, was held on immigration charges only. Maxwell . and Porter both declined to elaborate on the suspects, short of saying . that the two men in police sketches released by the Georgia Bureau of . Investigation are still at large.

Ongoing: FBI assistant apecial agent Ricky Maxwell announced that two men were in custody but that the men in the police sketches remained at large. He declined to give further details due to the 'ongoing' case . Maxwell urged anyone with information regarding the two African American suspects to come forward. Earlier on Wednesday, a law enforcement source confirmed to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that there was a ransom demanded by the kidnappers. However, Clayton County officials said they knew nothing of such a demand. 'We haven't heard . anything about a ransom, I don't know how that got out,' Clayton County . police Sergeant Kevin Hughes told Mailonline.

A prayer vigil was also held at a local high school and 150 people attended. ‘She's so nice,’ one attendee told 11alive.com. ‘I don't know why people would do this to her. I'm praying just to get her home safely.’ Another classmate was struggling to come to grips with the situation. ‘I don't get it,’ said Sydney Chaquir. ‘It's not clicking in my mind why somebody would do this to her. It's like a dream.’ Clayton County Georgia police spokesman Phong Nguyen said Tuesday the invasion appears to be completely random. ‘It didn’t appear that they knew each other,’ he said. ‘They just moved in about a month ago.’ Relief: Around 150 of Ayvani's classmates and former classmates gathered at a Hampton, Georgia high school for a Tuesday night prayer vigil. Their prayers were answered Wednesday . Spreading the word: Many friends and even concerned strangers quickly took to social media to spread word of Ayvani's kidnapping and to gather information . Alert: Clayton County police monitor Brookgate Drive, a suburban street full of families where Ayvani had lived for just one month before she was snatched . Nguyen said the two African American . males smashed through a back door of the home and Maria Perez quickly . tried to hide her children, but the men found Ayvani. The men wanted money and jewelry, but Maria had none to give, so they took the girl instead. ‘This is the time for the Clayton community and the community as a whole to come together,’ Clayton County Police Chief Gregory Porter said. ‘We’re trying to make sure that we bring her some safely.’ The abductors escaped with Perez in a grey Dodge or Chevrolet sedan and were described as wearing dark clothing. Man hunt: A Clayton County Police officer questions a driver in the Brookgate subdivision. State, federal, and local officials have all joined the frantic search for Ayvani, which ended Wednesday with her joyous reunion with family . Worries: Toni Hill walks her granddaughter home from the bus stop Tuesday afternoon.

A collection of stamps featuring historic trading ships has gone on sale to commemorate the Merchant Navy. The Royal Mail has created the series of Mint stamps to pay tribute to the contribution of Merchant Navy sailors to the country over the last two centuries. The collection was launched today aboard one of its featured vessels, the Cutty Sark in Greenwich, London, with a handful of Merchant Navy veterans there to see their efforts recognized. Scroll down for video . The historic tea clipper Cutty Sark is among the collection of paintings which honour Merchant Navy servicemen . The Clan Matheson is among the ships featured in the collection. It was bought and sold several times before being purchased by the Ministry of Transport in 1955 under the name Empire Claire . The RMS Britannia was among the first ships to be built by Robert Duncan & Company in 1840, and famously carried Charles Dickens across to the US in 1842 . Among the ships are two Royal Mail ships, the Britannia and the Queen Elizabeth, which were used to shuttle mail in and out of British ports in the 19th and 20th centuries. The collection is accompanied by a miniature sheet of four additional black and white photographs which depict the service personnel who sailed in Atlantic and Arctic convoys during the Second World War. The famous ships each hold a special history which is celebrated in the collection which costs £5.20. RMS Britannia was a large vessel for its time, measuring 207 feet  long and 34 feet across the beam, with three masts. East Indiaman Atlas made its maiden voyage in 1813 to India and made at least nine more journeys thereafter until 1830 . The Bulk Carrier Lord Hinton was launched in 1986, measuring 508ft in length and 79ft in breadth . Contracted to carry Royal Mail post for over two years the RMS Queen Elizabeth became a luxury mode of transport, taking those aboard from Southampton to New York .

Spot the difference: Home Secretary Theresa May says police should have only one target but 178 have been set in the past year . Just days after police were told by the Home Secretary they 'have only one target, to reduce crime' it has emerged forces have been have set 178 in less than a year. Despite Theresa May's pledge to cut red tape officers are having to deal with even more brought in by police and crime commissioners (PCCs), it emerged today. The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners said today these targets had 'no resemblance' to previous Government goals and are based on what communities in England and Wales want. Mrs May championed PCCs as the 'voice  of the people' when they were elected outside London last November to replace police authorities. But it has been revealed that many have brought in dozens of new performance targets since taking office. Leicestershire has brought in the most - 26 - which will be measured against satisfaction surveys and crime figures. Norfolk has brought in targets to reduce crimes at certain times of night while Thames Valley's ten include 40 metal theft operations per year and to 'disrupt 20 problem and organised crime groups that prey on . vulnerable people and isolated communities'. A BBC survey found18 of the 41 PCCs have set new targets. But since Theresa May became Home Secretary in 2010 she pledged to begin 'dismantling targets' and allow officers 'to pursue the crimes and criminals you . believe you should'. Disparity: The Government wants red tape reduced but the PCCs they championed say new targets are needed to satisfy the communities they serve . At the 2011 Tory conference she said A year later she said she 'hadn't . asked the police to be social workers, I've told them to cut crime' and this year said she had 'got . rid of Labour's plethora of targets'.

European Commission officials will visit Gibraltar next week to assess claims of harassment by Spain as well as the legality of its border checks. David Cameron demanded action from Brussels after Spain suggested a £43.50 fee could be imposed on anyone wanting to cross the border with the British territory. The move will see officials from Brussels travel to the Rock on September 25 to assess the legality of the border checks. Battle of Gibraltar: Prime Minister David Cameron demanded the intervention after Spain suggested a ¿50 (£43.50) fee to cross into British territory . Downing Street said the decision was a ‘welcome response to the Prime Minister’s call’. The long-running dispute with Spain escalated this summer after Madrid suggested a 50 euro (£43.50) fee could be imposed on people wanting to cross the border to visit Gibraltar. Spain has also imposed strict checks on traffic at the border with Gibraltar, leading to delays of up to seven hours, in protest at the creation of an artificial reef. The Spanish say the 74 concrete blocks on the seabed disrupt an area used by its fishing boats, while the Gibraltarians say it was a necessary environmental measure. Spanish police vessels have also made frequent incursions into Gibraltarian waters, including one incident in which officers fired pot shots at a British jetskier. Solid as a rock: David Cameron has said he will only discuss the matter of Gibraltar if the locals wish to no longer belong to Britain . Brussels officials will now assess whether the border controls are consistent with EU laws on the free movement of people and goods. In a statement yesterday the Commission said the move had been agreed following talks between Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso and Spain’s prime minister Mariano Rajoy. Officials will also assess Spanish complaints about the artificial reef. The Spanish government has been accused of stoking the row with the UK in order to distract attention from its dire domestic problems. Mr Cameron pledged last week that Britain will ‘never’ discuss sovereignty issues with Spain unless the idea is supported by local people. He said he would like to see Gibraltar remain British forever.","European Commission to asses if Gibraltar border fees are legal .

Beverley Concannon will appear in court in October to face charges under the Animal Cruelty Act 2006 . The owner of four dogs that mauled a teenage girl to death has been charged with animal cruelty offences, it has emerged. Jade Lomas-Anderson, 14, died after she was attacked by the aggressive animals earlier this year. The dogs' owner, Beverley Concannon, from Worsley Hall, Wigan, has been charged with three offences under the Animal Welfare Act 2006. She will appear at Wigan Magistrates’ Court on October 1, Greater Manchester Police said. Jade's parents were outraged after the 45-year-old reportedly failed to apologise for her dogs' actions at the time of the incident. The charge comes after Jade's family launched an online campaign calling for a change in the law to make dog owners more responsible for their pets' actions. Justice for Jade seeks to amend the law so that police are able to prosecute owners of dogs that behave viciously. Over 10,000 people have signed the online petition, prompting the Government to extend the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 to include private property. The Department of Environment, Food, Rural Affairs said: 'The Government takes a deed and breed approach in dealing with attacks by dogs and sees early intervention as a crucial way to prevent future attacks'. Jade was alone at a friend's house . in Chaucer Grove near Wigan when she was . attacked by two bull mastiffs and two Staffordshire bull . terriers on March 26. Witnesses said she was attacked by the dogs after entering a room holding a meat pie. Jade Lomas-Anderson, 14, was killed by the dogs in March after entering a room holding a meat pie . While one of the animals tried to snatch the food, the others dragged her body to the ground and mauled her to death. Police marksmen shot the dogs on arrival at the scene. At the time, Greater Manchester Police revealed there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution. A spokesman said: 'At this stage . of the inquiry, we do not have anything evidentially to categorically . prove a crime has been committed, therefore it is unlikely at this stage . we will be seeking to bring a prosecution,' but added: 'That is not to say that no prosecution will ever be brought'. Jade's parents said they wouldn't have let their daughter go to the property if they'd known the dogs were there. Buddy, a Bull Mastiff, was one of four dogs owned by Colcannon destroyed by armed police after the attack . A male Staffordshire Bull Terrier (right) and Bull Mastiff Neo (left) were also involved in the attack which took place in March . Mr Lomas-Anderson told The Sun in April: 'I feel so guilty about that - it's eating me up inside. Concannon is thought to have been in . hiding ever since the attack and her house has been sealed off by the . council following requests by the police. Mike Lomas-Anderson,33,  said he hoped the petition will lead to a change in the law to protect other families.

Three men have been charged with murdering a bright teenager just days before he was due to receive his GCSE results. Ali Akbar Choudhury, Muhammod Malik and Mashudur Rahman are accused of killing 16-year-old Ajmol Alom, in east London, on August 12. They are also charged with the attempted murder of another 16-year-old, Ajmol's friend, on the same night. Choudhury, 20, and Rahman, 22, will appear at Thames Magistrates Court later today. Ajmol Alom, who was murdered in an apparently unprovoked attack, achieved eight grade As and three grade Bs in his GCSEs . Malik, 21, will appear at the Old Bailey on Friday. A fourth man, 19-year-old Aminur Nazir Khan, had already been charged by police over the attack and will appear before a court at a future date. Ajmol, described as a star pupil with 'a very bright future' ahead of him, was stabbed after he and his friends were confronted by a gang in Spey Street, Poplar, at 9.50pm on August 12. Ajmol was badly wounded, while a friend of the same age was also stabbed. Both were taken to an east London hospital, where the keen boxer died. It was confirmed last month that Ajmol, who was described by his headteacher at Langdon Park School in Poplar as 'one of our brightest pupils', achieved top grades in his GCSEs. The teenager achieved eight grade As in subjects including maths, science, English literature, geography, religious studies and citizenship; and three B grades in English language, humanities and physical education. Ajmol was described as 'one of our brightest prospects' by his headmaster at Langdon Park School in Poplar . Shortly after his death his headteacher at Langdon Park School in Poplar revealed he had been considering a career in medicine. Speaking after the teenager's GCSE results were revealed, headteacher . Chris Dunne said: 'One of the careers he was considering was in . medicine, and these results would have made that a very real possibility . in terms of university entrance. 'All . the many journalists who interviewed me after the horrifying event of . his murder wanted to know how ""good"" he was as a student. 'I . was able to say without hesitation that he was very able, looking . forward to GCSE results at a very high level and very capable of going . on to achieve the kind of grades which would have secured him a place at . any one of our best universities.' He . said that he had interviewed Ajmol for a place in the school’s new . sixth form a few weeks ago, and that he would remember most 'how . hardworking he was as a student, and how very decent he was as a . person'. Ajmol's headteacher said his last memory of the keen boxer was when he volunteered to be part of a peace project in Northern Ireland . Mr Dunne went . on: 'Some youngsters as able as Ajmol don’t ever realise their full . potential because they aren’t prepared to do what’s necessary to ensure . success. Some are remembered for the way they show off their cleverness . at the expense of other, less able students. Ajmol’s approach was the . opposite. 'He would always have been the last . person to boast of his ability. He regularly attended the extra classes . and revision sessions run by his teachers, even when he probably didn’t . need their help any longer. His friends could rely on him for help if . they needed it, not for arrogance or scorn.' The teacher said his last memory of the keen boxer was when he volunteered to be part of a peace project in Northern Ireland. Mr . Dunne went on: 'We are constantly bombarded with negative stories about . young people, about their poor attitudes and anti-social behaviour. Working in schools and youth clubs for the past 40 years I have learned . the opposite, that the vast majority of young people are in fact very . decent, and undoubtedly go on to be equally decent adults. 'Our school, our community, our country . has just lost one of its brightest prospects and we are all rightly . shocked and depressed by it. The best comfort we can take from it is . that, for however a short a time, those of us that knew Ajmol knew a . very splendid young man and a fine citizen.'

Single working mother Chelsea Press . was struggling to juggle her part-time job with raising her  young . daughter and paying her bills. Proud to be working, she just wanted to know if she was entitled to some more benefits to help make ends meet. So the 23-year-old booked a consultation at her local council offices to assess her  financial situation. After . totting up the income from her job and tax allowances compared with her . outgoings, she was horrified when the official  declared: ‘You’d be . better off on benefits’. As an unemployed person, she would not have to pay rent or council tax and would be £238 a month better off. Miss .

She . will stick to her traditional values of hard work and wants to  set a . good example for two-year old daughter Lacey. Miss Press also fears that other people with less of a work ethic could just take the softer option. She said: ‘I was disgusted. The council adviser should never have said that to me. ‘Telling some people they are better off on benefits would probably make them give up work. ‘I . love my job, but it is hard leaving Lacey when I am getting such little . financial benefit from it.

Work still doesn’t pay for hundreds of thousands of families who live below the poverty line,  researchers claimed yesterday. The study, which was carried out in Wales, found that 51 per cent of the poor come from working families. They include one-earner households, many of them traditional families where the mother stays at home to raise the children, and households where two adults work, but only part-time. The findings from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation came a week after the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that the Government’s welfare reforms are beginning to improve the incomes of working people compared to the welfare-dependent. The Foundation report said families were classed as below the poverty line if they earned 60 per cent less than the national average weekly household income. The report said: ‘The starkest finding shows that those who are working and live in poverty now exceeds the number of those who are not in work.’ Last night a spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said: ‘ ‘We remain committed to making work pay and our welfare reforms will improve the lives of some of the poorest families in our communities.’","Chelsea Press, 23, told she was £54 a week worse off by working part-time .

A teenager who was smuggled into the UK from Afghanistan after the Taliban slaughtered his father and brother has won the right to remain in the UK. Aspiring teacher Najibullah Hashimi, 19, said he owes a debt of gratitude to the British people who successfully backed his right to remain - including his adoptive family in Kent. Mr Hashami, who made a six-month journey to the UK after fleeing his war-torn homeland as an 11-year-old in 2006, would have had to return to Afghanistan under Home Office regulations when he reached the age of 18. Relief: Naj Hashimi was set to be deported back to Afghanistan, but his foster family and friends in Kent rallied to his cause . He secured 13 GCSEs and a handful of . A-levels while living with a foster family in Kent, but was fearful that . he would be sent back to Kabul - a journey he said would result in his . death at the hands of Taliban fighters. But he has been told that the . application to remove him has failed and - barring a final appeal from . the Home Office - he will be granted a visa that will allow him to stay . in the UK. Speaking from his . foster family’s home in Faversham, Kent, he said: 'I am so grateful. Once I have the paperwork sorted I want to go to university to become a . PE teacher. 'When I heard I won the case I was shouting and screaming, jumping all over the room. It was a relief. 'There isn’t the chance for education in Afghanistan for me. Here it is completely different. 'I honour this country, it has given me so much. I have learned something every day I have been to school. 'I want to be something in the future. I want to teach so I can give something back to this country.' Mr Hashimi - who speaks four languages - was described as a 'son and . brother' by his foster family, who covered . more than £1,600 in legal fees after an 11th-hour reprieve stalling his . flight to the Afghan capital prompted a series of tribunal hearings. Integrated: Mr Hashimi said he wants to become a British citizen . He has not seen his mother since she begged him to seek safety in Europe. The . Afghan said he first fled to Pakistan before walking for days and . nights on end and hiding on-board freight transport destined for Dover. He was eventually fostered by Steve and Michelle Griffiths, who already had two young sons, Tyler and Finlay. Now . an active member of Rodmersham Cricket Club, the Muslim teenager said . he feels fully immersed in Western culture and hopes to become a British . citizen. He said; 'Living with Steve is like living with my real family. I love them and I love being with them. 'To be in this family is like feeling safe. It would be really hard for me (to go back to Afghanistan). 'I have already lost one family, I don’t want to lose a second one.' Mr . Hashimi said he was terrified at the prospect of being sent on a plane . to Kabul and left to fend completely for himself, and admitted he faced . an anxious wait until the end of next week - the deadline for the Home . Office to lodge an appeal. But . he has been warmed by a petition of signatures backing his right to . remain in the UK, collected while he was being held in an immigrant . holding centre ahead of his intended removal. 'I don’t know who most of these people (who signed the petition) are,' he said. 'But . the public was behind me, so I just want to say a huge thank-you to . them, otherwise I wouldn’t be here now, I’d be in Afghanistan.' Mr . Griffiths said the decision by the Immigration and Asylum Chamber of . the Upper Tribunal, sitting in London, was heavily weighted on the . impact removing Mr Hashimi would have on his sons, aged nine and 11. Retired firefighter and full-time foster parent Mr Griffiths, 43, added: “It’s been a very long process. 'I . think it’s been a bit of a witch-hunt against Najib because he has . never done anything wrong since he has been in this country. He has . worked so hard and taken every opportunity. 'When Najib was removed (to the holding centre), they just couldn’t understand it. “There . are terrorists in this country who they (the Home Office) can’t deport, . then they are picking on a lad who wants to become a PE teacher and can . speak four languages and is going to be an asset to this country. War-torn: The teenager fled Afghanistan in 2006 and has not seen his family since . 'I can’t understand why the Home Office keep going after him. It’s bizarre.” He said the Home Office would have to find a point of law to be granted permission to appeal in the case. 'It’s been nearly three years of legal battles (starting before Mr Hashimi was an adult),' he said. 'We . haven’t always had legal aid and so have had to find some funding . ourselves. But it has been amazing because even strangers have been . handing over cheques to help because they believe Najib should stay.' ""To be in this family is like feeling safe... 'I have already lost one family, I don’t want to lose a second one."" Najibullah Hashimi, 19 . Mick . Nokes, who met Mr Hashimi through his cricket club, said he had been . inundated with people wanting to sign a petition calling for the Afghan . national to be allowed to remain in the UK. Thousands added their names to the document, while local MP Gordon Henderson also backed the campaign. Mr . Nokes said: 'I first met Najib when he first came to England. He told . me his story and I can remember he said he wanted a new life and put his . old life behind him. 'I was struck by how he came across, what a pleasant young man he was. 'He . has come to this country, worked hard, and has kept his religion and . faith while fully embracing western culture. In many ways, he is just . the sort of person we should fight to keep in our country.' Tory . MP Mr Henderson echoed his pleasure at the ruling, and said: 'When so . many undesirable people are allowed to remain in our country, I thought . it was quite indefensible that Naj should be sent back to a country in . which he has no relatives and no hope of a decent future.

Beanie Babies creator Ty Warner has been charged today with federal tax evasion after allegedly failing to report income earned in a secret offshore bank account. The businessman behind the stuffed toy animal craze in the 1990s has agreed to pay a penalty of more than $53 million. As Chicago prosecutors announced the charge against Mr Warner, his defense lawyer issued a statement saying the 69-year-old billionaire intended to plead guilty and pay the massive penalty. Charges: Ty Warner, the man behind the Beanie Baby craze, allegedly failed to report income in an offshore bank account . Mr Warner, who lives in suburban Chicago and is the sole owner of TY Inc., still faces the prospect of time behind bars. A conviction on a federal tax evasion charge carries a maximum five-year  sentence. The 69-year-old, said by Forbes to have a $2.6 billion net worth, was behind the Beanie Babies craze that made the company hundreds of millions of dollars in the mid-90s. The small, plush toys come in various animal forms with heart-shaped name tags and were considered valuable collectors' items. His most valuable investment however, is said to be New York's Four Seasons Hotel. He turned down a $900 million offer to buy it in November last year. Court documents allege that Mr Warner maintained a secret offshore account starting in 1996 with the Switzerland-based financial services company, UBS. His attorney, Gregory Scandaglia, said Mr Warner accepts full responsibility. 'This is an unfortunate situation that Mr Warner has been trying to resolve for several years now,' Mr Scandaglia said. A release from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago did not mention a $53 million penalty. Mr Scandaglia described it as 'a civil penalty ... for failure to file a Foreign Bank Account Report'. According to prosecutors, Mr Warner earned $3.1 million in gross income in 2002 through investments held in the UBS account. Income: Ty Warner has agreed to pay a penalty and will plead guilty, his attorney says . He allegedly committed tax evasion by failing to inform his accountants about that income. By leaving out his UBS income, he falsely reported that his total income in 2002 was $49 million, prosecutors said. 'Regardless of wealth, everyone must pay taxes on all of their income, not just the amount they choose to report,' Gary S. Shapiro, the acting U.S. attorney in Chicago, said in a statement. A date for Mr Warner's arraignment has not yet been set.","Ty Warner allegedly failed to report income in an offshore bank account .

'Ruthless and resourceful': John Anslow was sprung from a prison van while on route to court . A man accused of murder escaped a prison van on his way to court after jail staff took shortcuts with security, a court has heard. 'Ruthless and resourceful criminal' John Anslow, 33, fled a secure van still in his handcuffs after it was held up by a gang of men wearing balaclavas and armed with a shotgun and sledgehammers. Woolwich Crown Court heard that Anslow, who admitted conspiring to escape from custody, had just left HMP Hewell, near Redditch, Worcestershire, in January last year. Prosecutors told the court that Anslow managed to smuggle a mobile phone out of prison after guards failed to perform proper checks despite the prisoner being classed as an escape risk. Michael Burrows QC said that Anslow was strip searched and asked to squat by an officer on the morning he escaped. But guards failed to make him sit on a special chair which scans inmates for electronic devices. Mr Burrows said: 'That morning, none of the prisoners were scanned in that way. 'One of the prison officers says of that ""it was staff just short-cutting the process to make it quicker"". 'John Anslow was an E-lister (escape risk), following his search he should have been put in a holding cell on his own. 'But that morning, he wasn’t. He was put in a holding cell with at least 10 other prisoners who were also going to court that morning.' He added that Anslow, of Tipton, West Midlands, 'is a ruthless and resourceful criminal who arranged his own escape with help from others'. As his prison van was driven out of the jail’s grounds, a Volkswagen Scirocco pulled in front of it and three men got out and launched an attacked. Gone: Anslow escaped from this prison van after another vehicle stopped in front of it and threatened guards with a shotgun and sledgehammers . Hunt: Police didn't catch Anslow until March this year, more than a year after he went on the run . Mr Burrows said in the moments beforehand another inmate who was also being transferred began asking Julie Curran, a prison officer escorting them, whether they were on camera, where they were going first and if there was another van in front of them. Mr Burrows said: 'His questions prompted her to say to John Anslow ""Bloody hell, John, you ain’t got nobody to hold this van up, have you?”’ Once the van was attacked the driver was pulled out of his seat and punched in the face by one of the attackers while another pointed what appeared to be a sawn-off shotgun at him. Shortcuts: The court heard that security guards at the prison failed to carry out proper checks on Anslow before he left for court . Anslow told Miss Curran to let him go. He fled while still wearing handcuffs. He was eventually arrested on March 14 this year in north Cyprus and deported back to the UK. Four other people - Paul Cadby, 47; Luke Hazel, 24; Moysha Shepherd, 23; and Ryan Powell, 21, all from Birmingham - have also admitted conspiring to free Anslow. Ben O’Reilly, 30, Craig Wright, 29, Anslow’s partner Samantha Glover, 27, Daniel Morgan, 29, Robert Riddell, 41, and Stuart Reid, 52, all deny the same charge.

Veterinarians performed a 20-minute examination late on Monday afternoon at the Washington D.C. zoo when the panda cub's mother Mei Xiang (pronounced 'May Shong') provided an opportunity for baby bear to be checked. Mei Xiang put the female cub down and left the den for a short time to eat bamboo and drink water. Scroll down for video . The National Zoo's tiny panda cub has been given a clean bill of health after its first full health check. Vets at the Washington D.C. zoo performed a 20-minute exam on the as yet unnamed cub . The cub, born on August 23, is already showing her coloration with black patches around her ears, eyes and back. 'It’s amazing to see how much she has grown in less than one month,' said Brandie Smith, the zoo's senior curator of mammals and giant pandas. 'Mei Xiang continues to be a great mom, as she was with first daughter Tai Shan (pronounced 'Tie-Shon'), and it shows.' The cub's parents, mother Mei Xiang and father Tian Tian (pronounced 'T-Yen T-Yen'), are the National Zoo's second pair of adult giant pandas. The National Zoo's recent arrival was born on August 23 and is already showing her coloration with black patches around her ears, eyes and back. Cute as a button: Vets checked the baby panda over on Monday afternoon and gave it a clean bill of health . Both were born at the China Research and Conservation Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong, Sichuan Province and arrived in Washington D.C. in 2000.

The panda team, which has been preparing for an opportunity to perform a full veterinary exam, seized the opportunity and retrieved the cub from the den while Mei Xiang ate bamboo and drank some water in the adjacent enclosure. The exam was completed by 4.31pm. The National Zoo's baby panda now weighs slightly less than two pounds, more than double her weight from a short exam on August 25. From nose to tail, the cub is 10.6 inches long. Since her preliminary health check on August 25 the cub now also carries the signature black markings of a giant panda. Veterinarians also listened to her heart and lungs and reported her heart rate was 130 beats per minute and respiratory rate was 42. A twin cub was also stillborn repeating a similarly traumatic experience that occurred last year for Mei Xiang. After several years of failed . pregnancies, Mei Xiang gave birth to a cub last September that died less . than a week old from complications related to its lungs.

A witness in the case of a four-year-old boy who was allegedly starved to death described going to give him a hug but daring not squeeze him too much in case his bones broke. The witness, who cannot be named, told the jury at Bradford Crown Court how Hamza Khan was beneath an upturned drawer covered in blankets. 'I knew it was Hamzah because he was skinny and his baby suit,' the witness said and, describing how she had bent down to give the emaciated boy a hug, added: 'I didn't squeeze him so I wouldn't break his bones. 'He was that thin.' Tragic: Police found the body of four-year-old . Hamzah Khan in his mother's bedroom two years after his death. A witness . today told how before he died she didn't dare to hug him too tightly . because he was so thin . Hamza's mother Amanda Hutton, 43, from Bradford, is on trial accused of her son's manslaughter after police found the boy in a mummified state in her bedroom almost two years after his death. The witness, who was present at the house but cannot be identified, today described to the jury how Hamzah looked 'absolutely appalling' shortly before he died on December 15, 2009. 'He looked all crusty and pale,' the witness said. 'He looked really skinny, stick thin. He didn’t get fed much.' The witness said Hamzah only got one meal a day and had difficulty walking. The jury has heard how Hamza’s body was found by police in September 2011 in cot in his mother’s bedroom at their home in Bradford. He had died 21 months before he was found, Bradford Crown Court was told. Prosecutors allege the little boy was severely malnourished and had starved to death. Hutton, who denies manslaughter, is expected to argue Hamzah died of natural causes, the jury has been told. 'She had a lot of alcohol': Hutton, of Bradford, who denies manslaughter, is expected to argue Hamzah died of natural causes, the jury has been told . The witness described Hutton’s house . being filled with mouldy rubbish and faeces, saying: 'There were lots of bins . bags. Lots of mould and wee and cat food.' Asked what was in the bin bags, the witness said: 'Empty bottles, crisp packets, snotty tissues and lots and lots of cans.' The witness went on to describe the bathroom in the terraced house. The court heard that the bath was full of cat faeces and also had vomit in it which had gone mouldy. Hutton vomited regularly, the witness told the court, and could not walk properly because of her alcohol consumption. 'She (Hutton) had a lot of alcohol and she had three bottles a day,' the witness said. 'And she smoked a lot. It was vodka, Smirnoff and something. Usually from the Co-op. 'She drank more vodka than water.' The witness added: 'She was always being sick.' Asked whether the tap worked in the bathroom sink, the witness said: 'Green stuff came out of it.' The witness told the jury that laundry did not get done. She (Hutton) couldn’t walk properly and she couldn’t be bothered either. 'They were just in the kitchen in bags. She said he was going to do it but she never did.' The witness described how Hutton would tell Hamzah to 'hurry up, you silly b******' and saw Hutton hit the little boy. The witness did not know what happened to Hamzah after December 15, 2009. 'But I saw something brown in the cot,' the witness said. 'It may have been Hamzah.' Later, Hutton's brother, Michael, told the court his sister had been a cannabis user since the late Eighties. But he said her heavy drinking started much later. Mr Hutton said his sister was 'knocked about' by her husband, Aftab Khan. He said he would visit her and find her with 'less and less teeth'. Stephen Meadowcroft QC, defending, told the court Hutton's house in 2011 was 'an absolute pig-sty, filled with rubbish - disgusting, the state of it'. Mr Meadowcroft asked Mr Hutton if he was turned away from that house in 2011 and he agreed that he was. The barrister asked Mr Hutton about the state of house when he visited in 2009. He replied: 'Perfectly decent, ordinary.' Hutton's other brother Christopher said, in a statement read to the court, that his sister had been a heavy cannabis user for as long as he could remember. The case continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Witness can't be named but, it can be revealed, was present at the house .

An Albanian drug smuggler who tried to fool sniffer dogs by smearing packs of cocaine with Vicks VapoRub was jailed for 15 years yesterday. Admir Doda, 37, was the leader of a gang who imported at least 100 kilos of cocaine into the UK for drugs barons based in the Southampton area. The gang stashed tightly-wrapped packages of cocaine in socks before smearing the cold cure over the drugs. The cocaine was then driven to cities . across the south coast, including Portsmouth, Bournemouth and . Southampton, before being peddled on the streets. Gang leader: Admir Doda, 37, was jailed for 15 years for his role in a drug smuggling ring. The gang smeared Vicks 'VapoRub' over socks containing packets of cocaine to try and fool sniffer dogs . The cartel, who are all from Albania and Kosovo, then laundered their ill-gotten gains at several bureaus de change across the capital. But . they were arrested after detectives from Met Central Task Force’s Major . Investigation Team smashed the drug smuggling ring - one of the biggest . of its kind in recent years. Doda and five other members of the gang were jailed for a total of 57 years and 10 months at Southwark Crown Court yesterday. Doda, together with Aurrell Marqueshi, 33, Hysena Meta, 37, Henri Stafhansi, 30, Bledar Hyselinka, 29, and Florian Koxha, also 29, all admitted being involved in the plot. Hyselinka was jailed for 10 years and nine months while Koxha was locked up for 10 years and two months. Plan: The gang hid packets of cocaine inside socks, pictured, before coating them in Vicks VapoRub to try and fool sniffer dogs . Stafhansi was jailed for 10 years and . four months, Elasaf Marqueshi, who played a much lesser role, was . jailed for five years and three months. Meta was sentenced to six years and four months in prison. Marqueshi’s cousin Aurrell Marqueshi, 32, will be sentenced on Thursday. Sentencing them, Judge Michael Grieve QC said: ‘You all took part in varying roles and varying levels in this conspiracy which was a plan to bring high purity cocaine to the UK. ‘The plan was carried out successfully over a total period of 22 months. Some of you were involved throughout, some for shorter periods. ‘Quite clearly this conspiracy gave rise to a Class A drug operation on a very serious scale. ‘While the prosecution assertion of upwards of 100kg of cocaine is not accepted by all defendants, all do accept it did relate to the supply of many tens of kilos and the operation is accurately described as very serious. Behind bars: Henri Stafhansi, pictured left, was jailed for 10 years and four months while Hysena Meta, pictured right, was jailed for six years and four months . ‘All these defendants were either born in Albania or in Kosovo of Albanian descent. ‘They formed a close knit group bound by close community ties as loyal members of this organisation.’ Addressing Doda, Judge Grieve added: ‘It’s not in dispute that you played a leading and organisational role in the conspiracy. ‘The prosecution case is that you played the leading directorial role in the UK. ‘You largely kept your distance from the drugs and cash while meeting those beneath you. You were involved in this conspiracy from start to finish. ‘As far as I can see, there is no candidate for any position above you in the UK hierarchy.’ The gang were delivering drugs to Jay Connor, 34, and Shae Flaherty, 27, who are thought to have headed a major organised crime network in the Southampton area. Jail time: Florian Koxha, pictured left, was jailed for 10 years and two months while Elasaf Marqueshi, pictured right, was jailed for five years and three months . Prosecutor David Aaronberg told the . court: ‘The conspiracy concerned a plan to bring high purity cocaine . from mainland Europe and sell it to wholesalers by the kilo. ‘The . defendants would take the Sterling they received from the sales, . convert that into Euros, then take the currency to the suppliers in . Europe and buy more cocaine and so continue the process indefinitely. ‘It is the crown’s case the court is concerned with at least 100 kilos of high purity cocaine.’ Once cut and sold on the street the cocaine would be worth tens of millions of pounds, said Mr Aaronberg. Police used ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) technology to track the dealers en route to wholesalers before seizing a total of 10.5kg of the drugs after swooping on six separate occasions. ‘On some 90 occasions trips were made by one or more of the defendants to Bournemouth, Portsmouth and Southampton in order to supply cocaine to wholesalers,’ Mr Aaronberg added. Upcoming case: Aurrell Marqueshi, pictured left, will be sentenced on Thursday while Bledar Hyselinka, pictured right was yesterday jailed for 10 years and nine months . ‘Some 27 different vehicles were used during the conspiracy. Drugs or money was wrapped in cling film and brown packaging and Vicks Vapour Rub was used to disguise the smell of cocaine. ‘Packages were also placed inside socks which were hidden in vehicles in places where they were unlikely to be found.’ Most of the gang were charged by October 2012 but ‘steadfastly maintained’ their innocence and only owned up to their crimes after a jury had been sworn for their trial last week.

A young boy was pulled from singing a solo at the Last Night of the Proms at the last minute when BBC bosses discovered that if he performed, they would be breaking an old law prohibiting children singing live on television after 7pm. The child, whom the BBC will not identify, was due to sing the solo in Leonard Bernstein's Chichester Psalms in what would have been a highlight in the traditional concert at London's Albert Hall. But just two days before the concert which would have made the child's name, BBC lawyers had to tell him he could no longer take part because they did not have the necessary licence for him. Countertenor Iestyn Davies, 34, left, took the boy's solo part at the last minute conducted by Marin Alsop, right . The chorister was due to sing a solo at the Last Night of the Proms but was pulled from it at the last minute . Instead, executives at the corporation had to scramble to find an older singer to take on the role. As a result, British countertenor Iestyn Davies, 34, sang the part - which is usually sung by a boy-treble - at the eleventh hour, and only managed to rehearse with the female American conductor Marin Alsop on the day of the event. It was a disappointment for the child, a boy treble (with soprano voice) who had gone through rigorous auditions with the BBC to make the final three before being picked by Alsop, the first female conductor at the Last Night, for the starring role. The other two boys who made it to the shortlist had been on standby and were also disappointed when they were unable to perform because they didn't have the correct licences either. An obscure rule dating back to the 1960s bans children under 13 from taking part in a live broadcast after 7pm. The relevant part of the Children (Performances) Regulations 1968 is designed to ensure children do not stay up late performing to the detriment of their schoolwork, although it is seen as outdated and irrelevant by many. Local authorities, whose job it is to allow the child to perform or not, take differing views of the legislation, with some turning a blind eye to it and others upholding it to the letter. The BBC applied to the boy's local authority, and those of the other two on the shortlist, for a licence  to perform but were turned down. Well-deserved applause: Iestyn Davies and conductor Marin Alsop only rehearsed the solo together that day . As a result, they had to find an older singer two days beforehand to replace the boy, who is a chorister at St Paul's Cathedral. A spokesman for the cathedral said: 'I can confirm the Cathedral was informed by the BBC in the week of Last Night that our Chorister would not be needed at the concert.' A BBC press officer said the corporation had no option but to pull the boy from the performance on September 7. She said: 'Everyone agrees that this legislation is now completely outdated and the BBC with other broadcasters and members of the wider entertainment industry are working hard to try to get it changed, but it is not known if or when that will happen. 'Because the Chichester Psalms were going out live, this meant that reluctantly we had to change our plans.' But she added: 'Bernstein specified in the score that the solo part can be taken either by a boy treble or countertenor. We were pleased to have engaged Iestyn Davies to sing the part.' The boy, a chorister at St Paul's Cathedral, was unable to perform at the Proms because of an obscure law . Children whose local councils agree to grant a licence are able to perform live on talent shows such as Britain's Got Talent, but it remains at the individual council's discretion. Last year the then-Children's Minister Tim Loughton tried to overhaul the child performance regulations but the proposals have yet to be implemented. David Simmonds, of the Local Government Association, said: 'Times have changed a bit since the Sixties when the laws were passed.' The Children (Performance) Regulations 1968 was designed to ensure the safety of children when they perform. It places restrictions on how long a child can spend performing on stage or during broadcasts, broken down by age, and says no child under the age of 13 can perform after 7pm. Broadcasters are required to seek permission to allow the child to perform from the child's local authority. A spokesman for the Local Government Association said: 'This legislation was obviously drawn up in a different era. 'What we are seeing up and down the country is councils adopting a commonsense approach to the law.  Providing it doesn't impinge on the the child's education, and as long as it is done with the full consent of the parents, councils are using their common sense on this one.' He said it was hoped that the legislation might be 'clarified' in the future.","Boy treble was due to sing Chichester Psalm solo at Last Night of the Proms .

There will, no doubt, be people walking and going about their daily business. So far, so ordinary. But stop for a moment to really watch. Hunched over, shoulders tense, arms unmoving, heads often bowed – the simple act of movement seems a struggle for many. And that is because they are not walking correctly. I admit it sounds ludicrous – starting to walk is a milestone most of us pass shortly after our eighth month of life, usually with the help of our parents. But, typically, bar a little self-taught fine-tuning, there ends the lesson. Getting off on the right foot: Sports scientist Joanna Hall, right, and her client Karen Walsh, left, go through their paces . As adults, a life spent sitting at a desk, struggling around with heavy bags and wearing all kinds of lovely-looking but unforgiving footwear takes its toll on our posture. Just as we often sit incorrectly, we also walk incorrectly. The knock-on effect? An epidemic of joint pain – in particular bad backs – affecting millions of us. About eight in ten of us have one of more bouts of lower-back pain at some time in our lives. One Department of Health survey suggested that 15 per of adults are in continuous pain from a bad back. With this in mind, I first set about . researching efficient and posturally correct ways of practising the . everyday activity of walking. I . studied sport science at Loughborough University, so I have a strong . research background – and I drew from studies in the world of . physiology, biomechanics and fitness disciplines such as Pilates. I now . teach a simple way to master walking that is, I believe, the most . beneficial way of moving. I became my own guinea pig after . having my first child. I didn’t want to do the same level of exercise I . undertook previously – I used to jog for miles. Just from walking, my . thighs got leaner, my waist tapered in, my bottom was lifted and I . eradicated my saddlebags. I . can promise it will do for you what it has for hundreds of my private . clients: walking daily will help you shed up to 10 lb in less than a . month. Even if you don’t lose that much straight away, you will look . slimmer, dropping more than a dress size. Karen Walsh, 42, lives in West London with her husband Richard, 46, a photo editor, and their two children, aged six and three. She says: ‘I started walking two years ago. I was playing tennis with a friend in Battersea Park when I caught sight of a leaflet advertising Joanna’s method. ‘At the time, my daughter was just a year and a half old and I was desperate to get back some energy. ‘I’ve never needed to lose weight but I wanted to tone up. Joanna was an inspiration – amazingly fit and toned, and she glided rather than waddled along. It was great fun – and everything was explained to us on a one-to-one basis. ‘After just two weeks I could feel a difference. My bottom and upper thighs were much firmer. As a freelance projects manager – I work for milliner Philip Treacy – I need a regime that works with a busy life and children. Now, I try to walk twice a week with a girlfriend. ‘I lost 10lb and have kept it off, but more importantly I stand taller and my body feels honed from top to toe.’ You must make one diet tweak: no starchy carbs after 5pm. There’s no need to go to a gym, use expensive equipment or even to get sweaty. This isn't power-walking, which involves all kinds of strange hip wiggling. Read this guide for everything you need to master the technique: your new walking style will look fast, smooth and fluid – and you’ll feel dynamic and buzz with energy. HOW DOES IT WORK? The principle of my method is simple. It is based on correctly aligning the fascia – the connective tissue in the body, which starts just below the skin. In the 1990s, anatomists discovered that the fascia encases, separates and envelops every part of our physiology – muscles, organs and blood vessels. It’s like a net that holds us together. The theory is currently supported by many chiropractors, podiatrists and sports scientists. So by holding the body correctly as you exercise, you are effectively shrink-wrapping the muscles within the fascia and working the body from the inside out. By aligning the body properly, posture is corrected and movement becomes fluid while discomfort –such as back pain – lessens. The body benefits from correct postural alignment in three ways: . WHY WALK? The NHS scheme Live Well recommends that ideally we all walk 10,000 steps a day (about five miles), which burns up to 450 calories. But on average we walk only about 4,000 steps a day. It takes about ten minutes to walk 1,500 steps. Professor Tudor Locke, an American academic specialising in physical activity, suggests that walking fewer than 5,000 steps a day indicates a sedentary lifestyle. A 2010 Government report about sedentary behaviour showed that it is associated with higher mortality overall, heart disease, diabetes and some cancers. WALK TO BEAT DIABETES AND BOOST MENTAL HEALTH . Aside from improvements in posture, . higher calorie expenditure and protection for the joints, there are a . host of other health benefits to be gained from walking. CANCER . Ten thousand cases of breast and . bowel cancer could be prevented each year if more of us took a brisk . walk every day. Just 45 minutes of daily activity at a moderate level . could prevent about 5,500 cases of breast cancer a year in the UK. DIABETES . The Centers for Disease Control and . Prevention (CDC) in the US produced a fact sheet called The Relationship . Of Walking To Mortality Among US Adults With Diabetes, which states . that those with diabetes who walked for two or more hours a week lowered . their mortality rate from all causes by 39 per cent. HIGH CHOLESTEROL . A study was published suggesting that . low-intensity exercise such as walking improves insulin sensitivity and . blood lipid levels better than an hour-long high-intensity workout. MENTAL HEALTH . Charity Mind advocates walking to . relieve stress, improve sleep quality and fight depression, since . physical activity causes the brain to release endorphins – chemicals . that improve mood. DEMENTIA . Researchers from the Boston Medical . Center who studied people in their early 60s found that those with a . slower walking pace were one-and-a-half times more likely to develop . dementia.","Sports scientist Joanna Hall teaches a way to walk that aligns the body .
The technique can help alleviate back pain and help shed the excess pounds .
Cosmetically: by targeting the fascia, body shape is streamlined.

A routine traffic stop quickly escalated out of hand after a transport cop forced three members of a family to lie down in the road at gunpoint. Neighbors in the quiet suburb of Raintree Village near Toledo, Ohio, captured the incident on cell phone and posted it on YouTube. Local police chiefs have suspended the officer after the footage attracted a lot of attention and questions were asked about how it had gotten so out of hand. Scroll down for video . Aaron Tatkowski, his unnamed girlfriend and his 14-year-old son lie on the ground as officer Eric Hart brandishes his weapon at them . The incident occurred on Sunday afternoon when mom-of-two Cassandra Meyers was pulled over by officer Eric Hart for a license plate violation. When her father-in-law, Aaron Tatkowski, arrived on the scene in his truck with his girlfriend and Meyers’ two children. Tatkowski has said he approached Officer Hart because he didn’t like the way he was speaking to his daughter-in-law. He is reported to have said: ‘I’m [expletive] sick of you cops. I’m [expletive] sick of you harassing people for no reason.’ A witness described Officer Hart's policing as 'totally uncalled for' ‘He hollered for me to get back in my truck, so I got back in my truck,’ Tatkowski told Toledo News Now. ‘Next thing you know, I'm yanked out of the truck and it made my girlfriend say a few things. He yanked her out of the truck.’ Tatkowski says the officer threw him, his girlfriend, his daughter-in-law, and 14-year-old son to the ground. The police report says commands were not listened to, so Officer Hart got out his taser and handgun. Tatkowski says he complied with Hart, but worried for his two granddaughters, who were still in his truck, so he asked witnesses to start recording what was happening. In the video footage witnesses can be heard dialing 911, while Tatkowski and his unnamed girlfriend argue with Hart. Tatkowski, right, has been charged with several offenses including resisting arrest, while daughter-in-law Meyers was arrested and booked for obstructing official business . A witnesses told Toledo News Now that the police officer involved was out of line. ‘It was totally uncalled for, the way [the officer] was using force on people,’ said Jim Stechschult. Both Officer Hart’s report and the official response from Washington Township Police state that because the ‘suspects’ in this case were disobeying direct orders, the use of force and unholstering of weapons (at one point a taser also made an appearance) was justified. However in the wake of the video being posted online and going viral, Officer Hart - who has worked part-time for the department for about two years - has been placed on paid administrative leave. ‘He’s not in trouble, but to keep things aboveboard, we put him on administrative leave until an internal investigation is fully complete,’ Washington Township police Chief Christopher Kaiser told The Blade. Officer Hart speaks to a witness who had called 911 for assistance with the situation, while mom-of-two Cassandra Meyers can be seen in the background . ‘I’m not saying he did anything wrong, but we’re trying to show we’re not trying to sweep this under the rug or cover it up.’ Officer Hart also works for Toledo Public Schools as a school resource officer. On Tuesday, administrators put Officer Hart on paid administrative leave pending Washington’s Township inquiry, said Patty Mazur, district spokesman. She said Officer Hart has worked for TPS about 20 months. Tatkowski, 40, was charged with misconduct at an emergency, obstructing official business, and resisting arrest. He was arraigned Monday in Toledo Municipal Court, pleaded not guilty, and was released from the Lucas County jail on his own recognizance.

A daredevil artist took his life in his hands by going beneath the waves to get face to face with a pack of killer sharks and sketch their portraits. Jonathan Truss, 52, from Bournemouth, Dorset, is the first person ever to sketch great white sharks in their natural habitat off the coast of South Africa. He travelled to the country and dived in the planet's most shark-infested waters to capture the terrifying marine predators first hand. Scroll down for video . Just when you thought it was safe to pick up the . pastels: Artist Jonathan Truss inside a shark cage as he sketches great . white sharks face to face in their marine hunting grounds off Gansbaai, . South Africa . Daring: Mr Truss believes he is the first person to try to sketch the awesome killers in their natural environment . Waterproof: The wildlife artist, 51, is using china marker oil crayons and a waterproof plastic white board . Mr Truss plunged into the ocean armed with only a handful of china-marker oil crayons and a waterproof plastic white board. He then spent 90 minutes in a shark . cage studying the beasts and creating a series of rough sketches which . he later used as the basis of his paintings. Mr Truss created his art in sharks' seal hunting ground off Gansbaai - a stretch of water known as Shark . Alley because it has the world's biggest concentration of great whites. 'These days, there are so many wildlife artists out there, you've got to do something different,' he said. 'You want to be inspired and really . want to do it - and great whites fill that gap. But you can't see them . in an aquarium - if you want to see great whites, you have to go to . them, to the ocean. 'To see them in their environment where you are the one in the cage is very exciting. 'Most artists who paint wildlife don't . get out there to see it - only a small minority do. Most paint from . photos or zoos and put the animals into a wild environment. 'You can always tell because the animal's not scarred, or its muscle tone is different. 'Every great white shark painting I've . ever seen has been from photographs - as far as I can tell, no-one has . ever gone out to draw them in the flesh. 'But to my mind, the best part is going out there and seeing the animal in the wild.' Rough draft: A preparatory study of a great white drawn by Mr Truss and used to create his final artwork . Getting the angles: Self-taught Mr Truss spent 90 minutes below the surface on his quest to 'draw Jaws' Mr Truss and a cameraman were lowered . in the seven-man cage to which the freshly severed head of a tuna fish . was attacked to act bait to draw the hungry sharks nearby. Within minutes the Great Whites began circling and Mr Truss, with an aqualung on his back, started drawing. 'I call my sketches ""lessons in . looking"" - they are snapshots which you use and draw on to incorporate . into the finished painting,' he said. 'At this stage it is about actually . looking at the animal. Taking a photograph is different - it is instant . and you don't really look at the animal properly. 'When you are sketching you really . look - where their eye is in relation to the mouth, how big the rear fin . is compared to the length of the body, what the muscle tone is, . etcetera. 'I want to look into their eyes and . see how they narrow, see how their brows lower. The idea is to really . study something close up, to observe it first hand. 'Any underwater painting is going to . be very crude but it gives me a framework and I begin to think how the . painting might look, about the composition, the light, the colours. 'It's not going to be a polished, . finished product, it's all about looking and teaching yourself about the . animal and seeing it in its natural environment. 'I used the sketch as a reference and then produced the painting from it once I got home.' Teeming with sharks: The spot off Gansbaai chosen by Mr Truss is a favourite seal hunting ground known as Shark Alley, which has the world's biggest concentration of great whites . 'Lessons in looking': Mr Truss said sketching underwater was challenging, but worth it to get a feel for what the great white sharks look like first-hand and from close up . Drawing deep: By witnessing the animals in the flesh, Mr Truss says he is able to get a better impression of the details to paint a more lifelike and evocative painting . Thumbs up: Mr Truss spent 90 minutes in the cage studying the great whites. He said that seeing the animals in their natural environment gives a more realistic result in wildlife artwork . The diving team who escorted Mr Truss told him there could be just 1,000 Great Whites left in the world. The artist added: 'I'd love to think . I'm the first person to do this - but I could also be one of the last if . there really are so few left.' As well as his sketches, Jonathan got . around 150 photos from his dive plus video footage to use back in his . studio in Bournemouth. He says he saw around half a dozen great whites . while he was underwater, some up to 16ft long. 'It was a great thrill to see them. They seemed intelligent - they were checking me out, just as much as I . was checking them,' he said. 'It was very difficult to sketch well - . it was a bit like being in a truck on an unmade road, the swell pushing . me up and down in the cage - it was far from my comfort zone. 'But it was worth it to get a little bit of reference, to get a feel for what they really look like close up.' The result: Mr Truss with one of the paintings inspired by his experiences with the great whites. He has been an artist for more than two decades and regularly travels to Africa and India to see his subjects in the wild . Another of Mr Truss's canvases: He also leads art safaris and lectures with demonstrations painting wildlife on cruise ships . Mr Truss has received widespread critical acclaim for his work - despite only having an O level in art.

A recovering anorexic has turned his life around after discovering body building - and has now been signed up to be a model. Bullied as a teen at school for being overweight, Carl Creasy, now 22, drastically reduced his food intake, existing on as little as one apple and a small green salad a day. By the time he was 20, Carl's weight had plummeted to just 5st 5lb, leaving him dangerously thin . But after a friend persuaded him that eating the right foods would give him the muscular figure he'd always wanted, Carl, now a fitness instructor, managed to turn his life around. Now weighing a healthy 10 stone, Carl hopes to take part in a bodybuilding competition in Miami this year. Healthy: Carl Creasy, 22, beat anorexia after being introduced to bodybuilding by a friend and is now a model . Frightening: At his most ill, Carl weighed just 5st 5lb and was 'obsessed' with weight . 'I used to do whatever I could to avoid food and sometimes wouldn't come home just so I could avoid having to eat,' explains Carl, who also fronts a show on Sky's Active channel. 'I was addicted to the scales and if I wasn't losing weight I would increase my exercise. Sometimes I would go through the day [eating] just one apple.' Carl's battle with anorexia began in his teens after he was bullied about being overweight. Distraught, he began restricting his food intake in a bid to slim down and achieve the perfect body. 'I constantly felt tired and moody,' he says of his life while anorexic. 'It affected my concentration and I ended up missing classes at college because I just couldn't get up. 'I didn't even enjoy spending time with friends and felt embarrassed when speaking to people. 'Controlling my eating took over my life.' He added: 'I would eat the same things everyday as my body felt comfortable consuming these foods. 'I did everything . wrong which was causing damage to my health. 'I now know I could . have even died if I continued the way I was going.' But a chance meeting with a friend . helped him turn his life around - much to the delight of his family who . had grown increasingly worried about the toll the eating disorder had . taken on his heath. Carl, who had always wanted a muscular physique, was impressed by his fitness-loving friend's strong body and was fascinated by the revelation that getting a honed body meant eating more, not less. 'He basically told me the more I trained, the more food my . body would need to grow muscles,' he explains. 'We . then went training together and it started from there.' Inspiring: Carl hopes his story will give hope to other men and boys battling with eating disorders . Carl, who now works with bodybuilding supplements brand LA Muscle, dreams of appearing on the cover of Men's Health magazine and hopes his story will inspire other boys and men struggling with eating disorders. 'My image is very important to me and I always take on board what . people say. People were saying I needed to eat as I am too skinny but that was the one thing I ignored until I took a liking to my friend's . physique and how good muscles and definition actually look. 'I want to encourage others to help beat their eating disorder and tell them that skipping meals is not the way forward.' His family are equally thrilled by his change of heart. 'They were seriously worried about my health,' says Carl. 'Everyone is so proud of me now and relieved that I managed to beat anorexia as it was affecting my home life as well as overall health.' Although, according to NHS figures, one in 10 of those diagnosed with eating disorders are male, the problem is far less likely to be talked about - something Carl hopes to change.

Victim: Julie Roberts was watching TV in her living room when she was nipped by a spider . A woman who was bitten by a house spider had to be rushed to hospital and drip-fed antibiotics after the bite festered into pus-filled blister - which then burst. Julie Roberts, 41, was watching TV in her living room at her home in North Hull when the spider - which she describes as pale and whitish - scuttled up and nipped her ankle. What started off as just a small spot swelled over the course of a few days into a golf-ball sized lump and her ankle became stiff and painful. The mother-of-four went to the doctors and got some antibiotics for the bite. But she decided to go to hospital after nearly a week had gone by, and blisters began to form around the bite. She was kept in hospital for three days as doctors battled against the spider's venom and the boil burst - twice. Mrs Roberts, a secretary, said: 'The doctor said it could have poisoned my blood. The whole thing was terrifying. 'I was struggling to walk and started to panic. ""The bite had become a huge bump and was leaking horrible yellow stuff.' Mrs Roberts said she had never been scared of spiders and simply brushed the animal off her leg. 'It's unlucky to kill them,' she said. 'I can't believe something so little could cause so much damage. You expect to hear things like this in Australia or Africa, but not in England.' Poison: Mrs Roberts went to hospital after her wound grew from a small bite mark to a huge blister over several days . Burst: Mrs Roberts still has difficulty walking after the blister ruptured twice while she was in hospital . 'It was a pale-whitish colour and had a really small body, but really long legs. 'A woman at pest control has since told me it could be a genus pholcus spider, but I don't know what kind it is, I hope I never see it again. 'I was in so much pain, I just couldn't believe such a little thing could have made me feel so ill. 'When I explained the injury the hospital admitted me straight away and put me on antibiotics through a drip. 'But my bite then turned white and continued to grow and grow.' Over three weeks later Mrs Roberts is still experiencing pain from the bitten ankle. 'At the moment it is healing quite well, but it has taken a long time, and it still hurts me,' she said. 'I will always have a scar on my ankle.' And she admitted the experience has turned her into something of an arachnophobe. 'I'm terrified it could happen again,' she said. 'My little boy used to love picking up spiders and insects all over the place. 'Kameron is only five and I'm petrified he could get bitten. He's still only little and I dread to think what could happen. 'Now as soon as I get in the house I'm on spider watch, then before bed it is spider watch again. 'I haven't had a night's sleep since it happened.' Only 12 species of biting spider are known to be found in Britain. The UK's most dangerous spider is believed to be the steatoda nobilis - known as the false black widow spider - which can land grown men in hospital with its bite. Experts have warned of an increase in the numbers of the false black widow in recent years due to a run of milder winters.

Tom Attwater, 30, has said he hopes to raise £500,000 for his daughter Kelli who suffers from a high-risk childhood cancer. Although she is currently in remission, the specialist stem cell treatment Kelli will need if she relapses is not provided by the NHS. It would cost at least £500,000 to fly her and her family to America or Germany for the life-saving treatment. Tom Attwater (left) has said his dying his wish is to raise enough money to pay for treatment for his daughter Kelli (centre) Business manager Mr Attwater said: 'Kelli is an amazing little girl. She’s the most inspiring person I know and she’s only four. 'I am 30, I have had a very good life. I can accept it. At four years old how can you accept it? You haven’t had any chance to live. 'Because Kelli has relapsed once, doctors have said she’s likely to again. I need to know that she’ll be looked after when I’m gone.' Kelli was first diagnosed with neuroblastoma when she was three months old. She underwent seven months of chemotherapy and several operations. The chemotherapy Kelli had also makes her more likely to develop other types of cancer, including leukaemia. In August last year she suffered a relapse. Despite now being in remission for a . second time Kelli's family have been told she is likely to relapse . again. If she does she will need treatment that is not provided by the . NHS. Kelli was first diagnosed with neuroblastoma when she was three months old. She underwent seven months of chemotherapy and several operations . She would have to be flown to either America or Germany, where she would be treated with stem cells in the attempt to develop a new immune system. Mr Attwater said: 'It’s disgraceful that the NHS will pay for someone’s boob job, but not treat a child for cancer. 'I’ve always paid my taxes, I’ve always . worked, and now when we need to put them to use we can’t. It’s . incredibly unfair and it makes me very angry.' The chemotherapy Kelli had also makes her more likely to develop other types of cancer, including leukaemia . Mr Attwater was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumour in September and was told it was terminal in April. Kelli’s mother, Joely Smith, 26, a primary education student, said: 'It was a double blow for me. 'Tom didn’t look anything up on the internet, but I couldn’t help myself. 'He only wanted to know how much time he had left. His life expectancy is two to three years, and he’s already had one.' Mr Attwater had suffered from headaches but did not think it was anything serious until he collapsed and suffered a seizure in his sister’s kitchen. Doctors found a tumour in his brain. If it had been left much longer the pressure would have killed him. Mr Attwater said: 'When I found out it was terminal, part of me did think, ""I’m a 29-year-old man and I’ve achieved nothing"". 'But then I made lists of things I wanted to do - one for a month, one for six, one for a year and so on. 'We’d love to have another child but right now I just need to make sure that if the worst does happen Kelli will be looked after. 'I know half a million pounds is a lot of money, but the chances of Kelli relapsing are so high. 'If 1,000 pubs or shops had a collection box then in a year we’d have achieved what we need to.

A dentist has been struck off for offering to perform female genital mutilation on two young girls. Somali-born Omar Addow is the first practitioner to be struck off by the General Dental Council for offering the illegal procedure in more than a decade. The 56-year-old was allegedly recorded saying he would carry out the crime, which carries a 14-year prison sentence, in a Birmingham dental practice last year. The General Dental Council (whose London offices are pictured) ruled Omar Addow intended to perform the illegal operation on two young girls . A hearing last month found Addow guilty of offering the operation, reportedly telling an undercover journalist: 'I will do it for you. Between you, me and Allah only.' The hearing ruled Addow performed an internal examination of the woman in his dental practice, before showing her medical instruments used to perform female circumcision. Former model and women's rights campaigner Waris Dirie has accused authorities of not doing enough to stop female genital mutilation . It was reported the woman asked him if he would carry out genital mutilation on her two nieces, aged 10 and 13. In its judgment the GDC ruled: 'At the time he made the offer, Mr Addow intended to carry out the procedure, namely female circumcision, at some point in the future'. Following the publication of an article last year which accused him of the crime, Addow was arrested but later released. The 56-year-old was not present last month's hearing after reportedly returning to Somalia to work. As many as 100,000 women living in Britain are estimated to have undergone female genital mutilation, which is common in parts of Africa and in the Middle East. Earlier this year Somali-born feminist Ayaan Hirsi Ali warned of the dangers of young girls being taken abroad during school holidays to have the operation performed. Ms Ali and other campaigners, including former model, Waris Dirie who underwent the procedure herself, have accused authorities of not doing enough to stop FGM being carried out. A helpline which was set up by the NSPCC in June has referred 34 potential cases of female circumcision to police. Officers have carried out two undercover investigations relating to FGM in the past two years, but neither has resulted in prosecution due to an apparent lack of evidence. A spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers on FGM told the Sunday Times: 'We are investigating a case in which we have evidence that would indicate that an offence has taken place. 'It's a live investigation and we still have some way to go.' Recent figures revealed 2,100 victims of female circumcision have been treated in London hospitals since 2010. There are an estimated 66,000 survivors in the UK, with over 20,000 girls thought to be at risk.","Omar Addow struck off by General Dental Council last month .

Meet Suzy Monty, who, at 62, is the UK's oldest glamour model and cites Helen Mirren as her inspiration. Suzy, who is a slim size 10 and 5ft 7"", has carved out an unusual niche for herself, combining regular modelling work with the 'odd light glamour one' and frequent appearances in naturist publications. And although happily married to husband John, 66, for more than 40 years, the Cornwall model says she still gets plenty of attention from admiring younger men. Stunning at 60: Suzy Monty, 62, from Cornwall, is still a size 10 and hopes to model for years to come . No change: Suzy seen in a bikini shot taken in her 20s (left) and posing in a similar shot taken at the age of 62 . 'Girls ask me for pictures for their . granddads and I get 20-something men calling me gorgeous,' she told last week's Closer magazine. 'They like that I'm an old lady with a younger body.' Luckily . for husband John, Suzy has no plans to trade him in for a younger . model. 'He enjoys having a younger looking lady on his arm,' she . reveals, adding: 'I'm hoping I'll still be modelling for years to come.' Suzy, who took to the catwalk for the first time at the age of 10, modelled throughout her 20s and 30s but gave it up following a debilitating bout of glandular fever in her 40s. But after a 20-year hiatus, she decided to relaunch her career after seeing a photo of actress Helen Mirren - who is five years older - looking wonderful in a bikini. 'I missed modelling but didn't consider going back to it until I saw Helen on the beach,' she revealed. 'I thought, ""I'm 57 and my body is as good as hers"".' Creative: Suzy does lots of fantasy themed shoots and also works for naturist publications . Age-defying: Suzy shows off her trim figure, honed by regular walks and healthy eating, in these photographs . Glamorous: Suzy looks many years younger than she really is and rarely wears make-up . But to begin with, things didn't go . to plan and Suzy was turned down by an agency because she didn't have . the grandmotherly appearance they were looking for. 'About six years ago one model agency I approached said that I didn't have the ""granny"" look for my age,' Suzy told MailOnline. 'They missed the whole point - a woman looking young for her age. Thankfully, I have since been taken on my a another model agency which does realise my potential as a younger-looking model.' And it seems that her move has paid off, as Suzy reveals: 'I am doing a lot of fashion shoots at the moment and the odd light glamour one.' 'Modelling is my passion,' she adds. 'It may look glamorous but actually it is hard work if you want to get to the top of the profession. 'Keeping a level head has helped. Parts of the modelling industry can be a tad egotistical.' Suzy, who has done almost 1,000 shoots, including some 'fantasy shoots - like dressing up as a warrior in my undies' says she keeps her face and figure looking good by eating well and eschewing make-up. She avoids sunbathing, enjoys regular facials and keeps fit by taking her dog for regular walks along the beach. But of all her anti-ageing tricks, the most important one, she says, is to keep smiling. 'Radiate joy and people will smile back, making one's day a happier experience,' says Suzy. 'I honestly think people these days don't smile enough, I smile at everyone, even animals.'","Suzy Monty, 62, is the UK's oldest glamour model and is a slim size 10 .

Marks and Spencer was caught up in a new mis-selling scandal last night over its campaign to sign up energy customers. More than 200,000 households now get their gas and electricity through M&S Energy but it is claimed many were misled over savings being offered. For five years the retailer has had salesmen approaching shoppers in-store and persuading them to sign up on the spot to switch their energy supplier. Mis-selling: An M&S whistleblower claims sales staff used tricks to bamboozle . clients into signing up to new energy deals even though they might cost . them more than their old supplier . Some of the sales teams earned up to £3,000 a week in commission for getting the signatures. But the Daily Mail has learnt that M&S has suddenly banned its salesmen from signing up new customers in store because it wants to avoid further accusations of mis-selling. The company could now face claims from thousands of customers and any victims referred to the Energy Ombudsman could be paid compensation of up to £5,000 each. M&S has accepted that some . customers may have been mis-sold contracts but claim it was ‘less than . one per cent of customers’. A . whistleblower has told how staff were trained to target M&S . customers nicknamed ‘Gladys’ – meaning ageing women who would be keen on . saving money and easy to sign up. Inviting: An M&S energy sales leaflet . The source claimed sales staff used a host of tricks to bamboozle clients into signing up, even though the new deals might cost them more than their old supplier. The root of the problem was ‘comparison books’ given to all M&S Energy staff. These were supposed to show customers accurate prices for gas and electricity from their existing suppliers, such as British Gas, and the prices being offered by M&S Energy. But the books rounded up prices to the nearest £50, leaving scope for staff to mislead. Realising the danger the books represent, bosses have demanded staff return them all – with threats of the sack if any are kept. The in-store sales teams are still being paid but have been forbidden from signing people up, the key part of their job. All they can do is direct potential customers to go online or phone the M&S Energy helpline – as in both cases all details of the transaction are either audio-recorded or retained on computer, meaning the firm can fight any compensation claims. The whistleblower said: ‘I’ve worked for M&S Energy for years – and while their party line is that only one per cent of customers were mis-sold to, most of us think it’s a lot more than that. ‘As far as I’m concerned the only people I didn’t mis-sell to were the tiny minority who brought their energy bills with them so they could do a proper comparison, or the small percentage who did genuinely save with us. ‘Our pay is around £12,500-£15,000 a year basic plus commission – and sometimes that commission was £3,000 a week. ‘Before we were told to sign people up on the spot, and if we weren’t meeting targets they sent us to find a “Gladys”, the official training term for an older woman considered easy to sell to. ‘People rarely had their bills on hand, which you need for a proper price comparison, so we used all sorts of tricks to get them to sign up, including doing rough estimates of their energy use based on the size of their home, but which we could stretch to our advantage.’ When the Daily Mail made undercover visits to M&S stores across the country this week, all the M&S Energy staff we could find refused to sign us. Marks:The whistleblower told how staff were trained to target M&S . customers nicknamed 'Gladys' meaning ageing women who would be keen on . saving money and easy to sign up . The scheme is run in partnership with energy firm Scottish and Southern Energy, which M&S bosses are blaming for the looming crisis. When it was launched five years ago, M&S executive Carl Leaver said: ‘The energy sector can be quite complex and we want to make it simpler for our customers.’ The relationship with SSE soured in April when it was fined a record £10.5million by energy regulator Ofgem for ripping off up to one million customers. MPs and consumer groups called for criminal prosecutions for fraud as it emerged that many customers were persuaded to sign up to get gas and electricity from SSE after salesmen, including those in M&S stores, assured them they would save. In fact their bills rocketed, sometimes by hundreds of pounds a year. Last night an M&S spokesman . admitted that its energy salesmen were no longer allowed to sign up . customers in store – and effectively accepted that its previous sales . process had not followed ‘best practice’. According to a Marks and Spencer spokesman the energy salesman are no longer allowed to sign people up to energy contracts in store . The spokesman said: ‘This is a past issue which SSE has taken action to resolve. We take our responsibility for selling energy very seriously and believe our new in-store sales process follows best practice by allowing our customers to finalise the sale process at home, staying in control of the final decision making.’ The spokesman added that the ‘comparison books’ seized back from staff were due to be replaced with computer tablets, but said Ofgem accepted they had been ‘compliant’ with regulations. She said there was nothing unusual for a company to require staff to return old work property. Hannah Mummery of the Consumer Futures pressure group said: ‘Energy suppliers have begun to realise that poor behaviour has eroded customer confidence – hopefully we’ll see better behaviour in the future.’","Over 200,000 households get .

Poor performances by Britain's elite swimmers has been blamed on them training in the 'wrong water' by a top coach. Bill Furniss, head of British Swimming, says perfect conditions at Sheffield's Ponds Forge pool hampers competitors because they cannot replicate their fast times anywhere else in the world. Britain's swimmers won less than half the expected medals at the London 2012 Olympics last year and in the recent World Championships in Barcelona. Perfect: Ideal conditions at Sheffield's Ponds Forge pool is hampering competitors because they cannot replicate their fast times anywhere else in the world . Top national and international competitions and trials are held at Ponds Forge which was built for the 1991 World Student Games. The pool is well known for recording fast times because of its design and consistency of the water. The amount of ozone and oxygen in the water helps improve buoyancy and the depth and design cuts down the resistance. But Furniss says the perfect conditions means swimmers can't reproduce their fast times. Britain's head swimming coach Bill Furniss (left) and former Olympic swimmer . Steve Parry (right) both believe training in Sheffield's Ponds Forge pool is . putting swimmers at a disadvantage . He said: 'Sheffield is a problem. I don't want trials there. In the future we will question that. I would rather use slower pools. 'It is a fast pool and these guys swim there all the way through their career.' Former British international swimmer Steve Parry agrees with Furniss. He said: 'Most people don't spend their lives in competitive swimming so to hear of a fast pool does sound daft but it's proved to be very fast. 'Ponds Forge seems to have the perfect depth of three metres because it's all to do with the resistance in the water and also there's the consistency of the water. 'Because it's got ozone and oxygen in it, it's very buoyant so that allows people to swim faster as well. 'Ponds Forge is just a fantastic facility. It is a victim of its own success because it is so good. All our swimmers go there, post really fast times and then can't replicate it later in the year. I think that's working against them.'","British swimming coach says perfect conditions at Sheffield's Ponds Forge pool hampers competitors .

One victim's father told CBS: ''I will say to have your child attending a school that's in fear and harassed by others is simply not fair, and we will just wait to see the outcome.' Holt's mother insisted her son was innocent. 'I just want his name cleared, because Byron is a good kid,' his mother, Tasha Penniman, said.","Kishawn Tre Holmes and Byron Holt Jr., both 17-year-old students at Vista Murrieta High School, 60 miles southeast of LA, were arrested Thursday .

Four women have testified about intimate relationships they had with a man while he was married to a woman he is now accused of strangling. Samantha Duffy, Sabrina Lucia Strieck, Julie Hansen-Freeman and Renee Stewart told the court in King County, Washington that they had sexual relations with David Pietz while he was married to Nicole Pietz, who was found dead in a wooded area in Burien in February 2006. Stewart also said Pietz also told her that he regularly drugged his wife's drinks with ecstasy to loosen her up and encourage her to take part in a threesome. On trial: David Pietz is accused of murdering his wife after prosecutors claim he was unhappy in their marriage . Killed: Nicole Pietz, 32, was found dead in February 2006. She is pictured with her husband, David Pietz . The testimony comes in stark contrast with the loving, concerned husband Pietz portrayed as he took part in television interviews pleading for information after his wife went missing. Prosecutors claim he killed her after he became unhappy in their marriage. Strieck, a former co-worker, testified that she and Pietz began a relationship when he was engaged. 'He told me he cared about me,' she said, King 5 News reported. 'I asked him why he was getting married, he said . that at that point, it was too late to back out of it.' She said their affair continued after the couple married and Ms Duffy said they also had a sexual relationship when he was with his wife. Hansen Freeman added that she had an encounter with Pietz and another woman, explaining: 'Me, Katie and Davie. It was just the three of us kissing.' Stewart, who Pietz met at a gym, . testified that they kissed and said he told her he had twice put Ecstasy in his wife's drink . while they were out. Nicole Pietz was a recovering drug addict. Mistress: Sabrina Lucia Strieck testified that she had an affair with Pietz before and after he was married . Cruel: Renee Stewart said Pietz slipped Ecstasy into his wife's drink so she would go along with a threesome . Affair: Samantha Duffy said that she had sex with Pietz, while another woman said they kissed . On one occasion when she was out with the couple, Pietz propositioned her for a threesome and slipped his wife the drugs, Stewart said in court. 'He told me that he would put it in her Red Bull,' she said. 'He was just trying to loosen her up to get her to do a threesome. 'She became overtly sexual. She was willing to do things that seemed to be out of her character.' The testimony came after jurors heard a recording of Pietz's interview with police in which he said he never used drugs and had a low sex drive. 'I don't have much of a libido,' he told police in the interview. 'She was usually, yeah just kind of opposite roles of what the stereotype is.' Scene: Her body was found in a wooded area in 2006. Police said evidence suggested she had been killed at night - not in the day as Pietz suggested - as she still had her night mouth guard in . Search: Investigators search their home after the disappearance and remove their computer . For years, there were no charges . brought in connection with the murder - until police arrested Pietz, 34, . last year and charged him with second-degree murder after advances in . technology. Detectives were initially interested in Pietz as a suspect after learning that he was unhappy in his marriage and now they say they have built a case on circumstantial evidence. Pietz, who had been married to his wife for four years, was finally arrested earlier in March 2012 after DNA and phone GPS linked him to the scene, police said. Investigators claimed there were contradictions in his statements and he failed a lie detector test before refusing to undergo a second. Mr . Pietz told police that on January 27 he got home from work around . midnight and briefly said goodnight to his wife, who was already . sleeping, KOMO reported after his arrest. Emotional: Earlier this week, Gael Schneider, Nicole Pietz's mother, unleashed an emotional rant when she came face-to-face with the accused killer in court . Cover? in 2006, Pietz had appeared on television beside Schneider pleading for information in the case . The next morning he said left for work at 8.30am without speaking to Nicole and had no contact with her throughout the day. Mr . Pietz told police that he called 911 when he went straight to a planned . dinner with friends that night and his wife never arrived. He claims that she must have vanished as she headed to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting that morning where she was going to celebrate 8 years of sobriety. He claimed that he believed she had fallen back into her old drug habit. However, police said that forensic . tests - including undigested food in her stomach - showed that Mrs Pietz . had been killed around midnight on January 27. When . her body was found, she was wearing a mouth guard she only wore at . night and her wedding ring was in cleaning solution in the bathroom; . friends said she only took it off at night to clean it. Loss: Investigators believe the couple was having marital problems and that Mr Pietz had cheated on his wife . Phone records also show her phone was allegedly used at her husband's workplace. And . DNA evidence showed that Mr Pietz's was the last person to drive her . car, which was found two weeks after her body in a parking lot near the . University of Washington. But defense attorneys have argued that their case is weak and that there were no eyewitnesses.

Beautiful shoes are the foundation of any fashionable woman's wardrobe, and as the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour has access to more stylish skyscraper heels than she could ever wear. So why, then, has the legendary fashion editor insisted on wearing the same pair of nude, pointy-toed slingbacks not just to every London Fashion Week show she has attended over the past few days, but almost everywhere she has been since 1994, when they were first made-to-measure for the editor by Manolo Blahnik himself? Blahnik showed his shoes at London Fashion Week for the first time this Monday, when he revealed his reason for doing so: 'I wanted to get more in touch with normal people.' It's shoe time! Anna Wintour at the MaxMara show in Milan yesterday wearing a version of her favourite nude slingbacks. RIGHT: Same shoes, same day - different dress . June 1999: An early sighting of the shoes . October 2003: Milan Fashion Week . July 2004: Jean Paul Gaultier fashion show . April 2005: Out shopping in New York . September 2006: Fashion Rocks concert . June 2006: At a fundraising event . His shoes are not the most expensive out there, but still hover around £500 a pair, so the idea that he is connecting with 'normal' is slightly moot. More importantly, he unveiled his shoes for next spring: they come in a riot of colours, from daffodil yellow to sugary pink, acid green and scarlet, and are adorned with tassels, bows, silver buckles, gold brocade, cream embroidery, zebra spots, florals... All of which seemed infinitely more exciting than the nude pair, which have two intersecting straps over the front of the foot, that Anna Wintour seems to have had surgically attached to her tootsies. September 2007: Calvin Klein show . August 2008: Paired with a blue dress . October 2009: Paris . Fashion Week . August 2009: At a film premiere . So why does the fashion editor love them so much? Well, first off, these shoes are not really nude. They are produced expressly for Anna in two skin-coloured tones that perfectly suit her colouring. Blahnik made a last - a wooden model of Wintour's foot - around which he sculpts her shoes, meaning each pair will fit her contours exactly. Which means they are supremely comfy. A godsend, given she sometimes has to walk from limo to kerb. Ms Wintour takes delivery of several identical pairs each season, as she is very aware of that cardinal fashion rule: never wear a pair of shoes two days running, as they need time to breathe. The open toe reveals her 'meticulously groomed' feet (Manolo Blahnik's words, not mine). Like Kate Middleton, who for years has seemed melded to her LK Bennett nude patent courts, Ms Wintour understands that nude goes with everything: jazzy prints, and every colour in the rainbow. Nude is far more summery than black, and less severe. A closed shoe or, worse, an ankle strap, only serves to shorten the leg, and Ms Wintour 'has fantastic legs' (again, MB’s words, not mine). Anna Wintour realises that her shoes, as she sits with her legs crossed in the front row, will appear in almost every catwalk photo for the rest of eternity, and, perhaps, can't be bothered to choose a fresh design for every appearance, to be picked over by people like me. September 2010: With a red tweed Chanel dress . October 2010: Worn with a black coat at Fashion awards . September 2011: Carolina Herrera show . September 2013: . London Fashion Week . Her Manolos, like her glossy bob, love of fur and pastel cardis, are a trademark, a constant in an ever-changing sea of trends and mistakes and monstrosities that give you blisters. I applaud her, actually, opting for the boring over the barking, even as her sharp stiletto heel sank into the soggy turf at the Topshop show on Sunday afternoon. At least we now know that, contrary to all reports, she doesn't walk on water after all...","Legendary fashion editor has worn same nude, pointy-toed slingbacks since 1994 .

Former CFO of Amazon Joy Covey has died aged 50 after colliding with a van while riding her bicycle, authorities said yesterday. Covey was integral in turning Amazon from a start-up to the billion dollar retail giant it is today after joining the company in 1996, when one of her main jobs was to persuade Wall Street investors to stick with the then-profitless company. The mother-of-one was cycling on Skyline Boulevard in San Mateo at 1.30pm on Wednesday when she collided with a Mazda minivan which was making deliveries for OnTrac - a shipping service sometimes used by Amazon and other online retailers, authorities said. Skilled: Joy Covey started working with Amazon in 1996 and persuaded investors to stick with the then-profitless company. Pictured right in 1999, the same year she left Amazon . Amazon CFO: Covey gets pointers on trading at the Chicago Board Options Exchange in November 1997, by Thomas Ascher, left, vice chairman, and William Brodsky, chief executive officer of the exchange .

'[Joy] was wearing a helmet, but the injuries were too severe and she was pronounced dead at the scene.' OnTrac, which is based in Phoenix, said . the van was driven by a 22-year-old 'contract driver'. Neither drugs or . alcohol were believed to be a factor and it is not known if he was delivering for Amazon at the time.

Wall Street, she makes it possible for me to spend a lot more of my time . on the customer experience.

During her time there, she was named one of Fortune magazine's 50 Most Powerful Business Women in America, when they said: 'As CFO, her feat was convincing Wall Street that a profitless company was worth $22 billion.' She took a salary of less than $100,000 in favor of stock options that, as of 1999, gave her a net worth exceeding $200 million, according to Forbes magazine.

Left to die: James Clinton, 18, was . discovered unconscious and badly beaten in a condemned home in Anchorage thanks . to an anonymous note . A badly beaten teenager left to die in the basement of a condemned building was rescued after an anonymous tipster left a typewritten note with police. Officers in Anchorage, Alaska, found 18-year-old James Clinton unconscious and in a critical condition in a home that was just two days away from demolition. Despite finding an identity card in the youth's pocket, officers were at first unsure of his name because he had suffered such severe injuries to his face. Anchorage Police Department spokeswoman Anita Shell said: 'It's my understanding he was beaten around the head and the face, the whole body.' After he was found on Monday night, Mr Clinton was rushed to an Anchorage hospital where he was yesterday reported as still unconscious and in a critical condition. His medical condition is so bad he has as yet been unable to speak to police, said Ms Shell. Police have appealed to the note writer to come forward to help them learn why, and by whom, Mr Clinton was beaten. Two University Police Department officers were on duty at their desks in a squad room at about 8.30pm on Monday when the note appeared, said University Police Chief Rick Shell. 'One of them got up to do something and noticed a note on the floor. He picked it up, read it, let the other officer read it,' said Chief Shell. 'The other officer saw content that led him to believe that the Anchorage Police Department should be involved.' The note indicated that a teenager had been beaten and left to die inside an abandoned building. It said the writer felt compelled to tell someone. The campus is more than two miles from the abandoned home in downtown Anchorage. Anchorage police found Mr Clinton in the basement. Police initially said he was being held against his will, but Ms Shell said his injuries prevented him from leaving. The home was owned by Covenant House, which operates a shelter across the street for homeless teenagers. Mr Clinton was homeless and living in the shelter late last year, according to a citation in a misdemeanour marijuana case against him seen by Anchorage Daily News. That case was eventually dismissed. 'How they were able to enter there is perplexing to me': Alison Kear, director of Covenant House, a homeless shelter which owned the building where Mr Clinton was found, said it was set to be demolished this week . Alison Kear, director of Covenant House, said the home where Mr Clinton was found was set to be demolished this week to expand a parking lot. Wrought iron mesh had covered the windows and doors were locked, she said. A security company had patrolled outside. The only access she could guess was a second-floor window not much bigger than a dog door. 'How they were able to enter there is perplexing to me,' she said. A picture of Mr Clinton taken from his open Facebook profile: On the page the teenager lists his home town as Inglewood, near Los Angeles, California . Police spokesman Ms Shell did not know if Mr Clinton's attackers had used a weapon and she could not say whether the crime scene was the abandoned home where he was found or elsewhere. 'We gathered evidence from that scene,' Shell said. 'I don't have specifics on whether that's where the assault took place.' Investigators allowed the scheduled demolition of the building where police found Mr Clinton to move forward as planned and a wrecking crew used heavy machinery to knock it down yesterday morning. Ms Shell added that police have released Mr Clinton's name and identity in the hope that potential witnesses might come forward. It is thought he may go by a nickname but detectives do not know what it is, she said. Mr Clinton's Facebook profile raises as many questions as it answers. On it he says he worked as an overnight stocker at Walmart and went to Bartlett High School, near Centennial Park on the north-east edge of Anchorage. However, he lists his home town as Inglewood, California, a rough district that is part of the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. On the profile page Mr Clinton, who turned 18 in January, also claims to have studied at the University of Alaska Anchorage, but university police said he is not currently enrolled there. An Anchorage schools district spokeswoman told Anchorage Daily News that Mr Clinton last attended public school there in 2011. A Walmart store manager in the city told the paper he couldn't immediately provide information. The profile itself was only set up on June 17 this year, with Mr Clinton commenting soon after: 'New leash (sic), no time for fake people.' He had just 15 'friends' linked on the social network. University Police Chief Shell praised the quick response by both departments that most likely saved Mr Clinton's life. 'This was just an absolutely outstanding case of two officers taking something that could have been fairly innocuous and taking it seriously,' said Chief Shell. 'It ended up saving the young man's life.'","James Clinton, 18, was rescued after typewritten note was left with police .

The assault case against Liverpool footballer Raheem Sterling collapsed today when his former girlfriend gave 'disappointing' evidence to support the prosecution's case. Sterling, 18, was alleged to have attacked 19-year-old model Shana Ann Rose Halliday following a row about a text message, Liverpool Magistrates' Court heard. Jamaican-born Sterling, from Southport, was formally found not guilty by magistrates when the Crown Prosecution Service withdrew its case after magistrates refused to treat Miss Halliday as a hostile witness. Not guilty: Raheem Sterling was tried for assault at Liverpool Magistrates' Court . He entered a not guilty plea at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court last month, having been arrested on August 8 following an incident in Page Moss, Huyton, Liverpool. He was granted conditional bail and arrived . at the same court last Friday afternoon for the start of his trial. Anthony Leo, Chairman of the bench, said Miss Halliday had given 'unfavourable evidence'. Miss Halliday, from Liverpool, was crowned the winner of England’s Top Model of the World beauty pageant earlier this year. She went on to contest the pageant’s world final in Egypt and reportedly works as a sales assistant for the Hollister clothing chain. Trial: Sterling is accused of assaulting Shana Ann Rose Halliday, pictured on holiday this summer (right) Miss Halliday appeared at Liverpool Magistrates Court today and gave evidence from behind a screen. She . said: 'We had a heated argument because I seen a text message on his . phone. It started because I was trying to get his phone. We just kept arguing. We were just name calling. I started it. 'Ten . minutes after we left the restaurant we stopped at a service station. When we got back, he told me to get out of the car and I said I wasn't . because it was raining. 'He said you've got to get out of the car. He pushed me and said I'm done. 'I pushed and shoved his chest and hands and he pushed and shoved my arm and back.' Back in the game: Sterling (right) competes in Liverpool training at Melwood on Friday . Sara Drysdale, prosecuting, made an application to the bench asking for the complainant to be 'treated as a hostile witness'. She said: 'The crown would say that Miss Halliday has demonstrated an unwillingness to tell the truth about what has happened.' She . said Miss Halliday, who gave evidence to the court behind a screen, had . given 'conflicting accounts' to her previous statements to the police . and which also differed from her original 999 call to the police on the . night in question. At times Miss Halliday failed to answer prosecution questions and was often so quiet she was inaudible. But Stuart Driver QC, defending, said the prosecution was engaging in a 'straw-clutching exercise'. Mr . Driver added: 'She has given evidence, slowly but in detail, and it's . unfavourable to the prosecution case. She is far from being a hostile . witness.' Anthony Leo, . chairman of the bench, told the court: 'Although she is an unfavourable . witness for the prosecution, she is not hostile.' After the bench made its decision, Miss Drysdale said there was 'no longer a realistic prospect of conviction'. Top player: Liverpool winger Sterling is a key member of the England under-21 team . The England under-21 international trained with the Liverpool squad this morning before going to court. Reports . suggest that the couple where driving when the assault began and his . black Range Rover Evoque came to a screeching halt, before the . altercation continued in the street. The . couple had earlier been celebrating her 20th birthday with a meal out . and the row is understood to have taken place afterwards.

Despite the U.S economy showing signs of improvement, not all segments of the population are seeing an economic turnaround, with Mississippi being named the poorest state in the nation. In 45 states and the District of Columbia, poverty rates remained steady at high levels, according to new census data. Mississippi was one of just three states posting increases in poverty, from 22.6 percent to 24.2 percent. Median income remains flat . household income in the us in 2012 declined slightly from 2011 . California and New Hampshire were the others. In Minnesota and Texas, the percentage of people in poverty declined. Among . the 25 largest metropolitan areas, the Washington, D.C., area had the . highest median household income in 2012 at $88,233, followed by the San . Francisco and Boston metro areas. The Tampa-St. Petersburg metro area had the lowest median house income at $44,402. By . state, Oregon led the nation in food stamp use at 20.1 percent, or 1 in . 5, due in part to generous state provisions that expand food stamp . eligibility to families. Oregon . was followed by more rural or more economically hard-hit states, . including Mississippi, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan and Tennessee. Wyoming . had the fewest households on food stamps, at 7 percent. Education, race, income and marriage are all deciding factors in recovery. Poverty is on the rise in single-mother families. More people are falling into the lowest-income group. After earlier signs of increased mobility, fewer people are moving as homeownership declined for a fifth straight year. 'We're in a selective recovery,' said William H. Frey, a Brookings Institution demographer who analyzed the numbers. The annual U.S. survey of socioeconomic indicators covers all of last year, representing the third year of a post-recession rebound. Household income in the U.S in 2012 declined slightly from 2011 . The figures, released today, also . show a slightly faster pace of growth in the foreign-born population, . which increased to 40.8 million, or 13 percent of the U.S. Last . year's immigration increase of 440,000 people was a reversal of a 2011 . dip in the influx, when many Mexicans already in the U.S. opted to . return home. Many of the newer immigrants are now higher-skilled workers from Asian countries such as China and India. The . number of immigrants in the U.S. with less than a high school diploma, . who make up the bulk of the total foreign-born population, fell slightly . in 2012 to 10.8 million. Immigrants with bachelor's degrees or higher rose by more than 4 percent to 9.8 million. In all, 21 states saw declines last year in their Hispanic foreign-born population, led by New Mexico, Illinois and Georgia. The number of Americans in poverty remained largely unchanged at a record 46.5 million. Single-mother families in poverty increased for the fourth straight year to 4.1 million, or 41.5 percent, coinciding with longer-term trends of declining marriage and out-of-wedlock births. Many of these mothers are low income with low education. The share of married-couple families in poverty remained unchanged at 2.1 million, or 8.7 percent. By race, a growing proportion of poor children are Hispanic, a record 37 percent of the total. Whites make up 30 percent, blacks 26 percent. The numbers also reflect widening economic inequality, an issue President Barack Obama has pledged would be a top priority of his administration to address. Upward mobility in the U.S. has been hurt by a tight job market and the longer-term disappearance of mid-skill jobs due to globalization and automation. The new census data shows that lower-income households are a steadily increasing share of the population, while middle- to higher-income groups shrank or were flat. An unidentified resident of Umoja village pets a dog in an alley between rows of wooden shacks that serve as home in the Shantytown erected on a public lot in the Liberty City section of Miami, Florida - showing poverty in the U.S. In 2012, households earning less than $24,999 made up 24.4 percent of total households, up from 21.7 percent four years earlier. The share of households earning $50,000 to $99,999 slipped from 31.2 percent to 29.9 percent. Top-income households making more than $200,000 dipped less, from 5 percent to 4.6 percent over that period. The still-weak economy also meant fewer household moves in 2012. After showing signs of increased migration in 2011, fewer Americans were on the move, many because of few job opportunities or the inability to buy a home. U.S. migration fell by 0.2 percent in 2012 after edging up the previous year. While the number of longer-distance moves remained steady at 2.3 percent, moves within a county edged lower to 9 percent, particularly among young adults 18-34. Demographers say that suggests eroding career opportunities and a diminished ability to buy a home. Young adults typically make long-distance moves to seek a new career, while those who make local moves often do so when buying a home. Homeownership declined for the fifth year in the row to 63.9 percent. 'Many Americans continue to think that a rising tide lifts all boats,' said Sheldon Danziger, a University of Michigan economist. 'But the bad news is that given the way economic growth trickles down now, the number of poor and disadvantaged will remain high unless we do more to help those in need.' With poverty remaining high, food stamp use continued to climb. Roughly 15.8 million, or 13.6 percent of U.S. households, received food stamps, the highest level on record. Just over half of these households, or 52 percent, were below poverty and 44 percent had one or more people with a disability.","2012 represented the third year of a post-recession rebound .

The infamous ‘London Whale’ trading scandal which rocked the City has landed America’s biggest bank JPMorgan Chase with a £570 million fine. The huge settlement includes a £137.6 million fine from the UK watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority, the second biggest penalty ever levied by British financial authorities. The remainder of the penalties will be paid to US authorities, including the Federal Reserve. Payout: JP Morgan was forced to hand over a £570 million fine following the 'London Whale' scandal . Yesterday the UK watchdog said the losses of £4 billion racked up by a group of traders in London ‘sent a shockwave through the markets’. In a damning statement, the FCA’s director of enforcement and financial crime Tracey McDermott accused the blue blooded investment bank of ‘failing to be open and co-operative with the regulator.’ She said: ‘We consider JPMorgan’s failings to be extremely serious such as to undermine the trust and confidence in UK financial markets. This is yet another example of a firm failing to get a proper grip on the risks its business poses to the market.’ Crisis: JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon (pictured in 2009) was dubbed the King of Wall Street but has seen his reputation tarnished by the debacle . The bank has agreed to settle actions brought by US authorities, paying $300 million (£190 million) to the Federal Reserve, and $200m (£120 million) to both the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. In one of the biggest trading scandals to hit the City, a group of London based traders working in the firm’s Chief Investment Office made huge bets on complex financial instruments and then covered up their losses for months. One of the traders, French born Bruno Iksil was nicknamed the London Whale because of the size of his bets. Two former traders face criminal charges in the US. But Iksil will escape prosecution because he co-operated with US authorities. Yesterday the UK watchdog also blamed top bosses of JP Morgan for failing to react quickly enough to the scandal, which first became public in April last year. McDermott said: ‘As things began to go wrong, the firm didn’t wake up quickly enough to the size and the scale of the problems. 'What is worse, they compounded this by failing to be open and co-operative with us as their regulator.’ JP Morgan’s boss Jamie Dimon, who has been dubbed the King of Wall Street, has seen his reputation tarnished by the debacle. He initially dismissed the losses racked up by his team of London based traders as a ‘tempest in teapot’. Yesterday he said: ‘We have accepted responsibility and acknowledged our mistakes from the start, and we have learned from them and worked to fix them.’","Settlement includes a £137.6m fine from the Financial Conduct Authority .

It is one of the world's most successful companies built on it's famous motto 'Don't be evil'. But a report by Business Insider says rather than peace and love, Google is filled with fierce relationships that would not be out of place in Game of Thrones. Behind the modern glass doors of the internet giant's California headquarters are complex stories of sex and intrigue. One member of staff told Business Insider: 'Inside Google, it's a Game of Thrones.' A report suggests Google is filled with sex scandal and political intrigue that would not be out of place in Game of Thrones, starring Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister . Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California, where insiders say bosses are trying to clamp down on in-fighting . Former staff told the website that the politicking that goes on behind the scenes is reminiscent of the secret networking in the famous book and television series. According to sources quoted by Business Insider, co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin actively encouraged loud and angry debate among their subordinates. But divisions within the company's various strands have now reportedly become so deep, that bosses are now trying to stamp out the in-fighting that was once so encouraged. Business Insider said that during a conference in Napa Valley in February, Page told senior executives that the warring had to stop and there would be 'zero tolerance for fighting.' The alleged change in stance comes after rumoured rivalries between the likes of former search and product executive Marissa Mayer, who is now CEO of Yahoo, and Salar Kamangar, CEO if YouTube. It was not only the networking and politicking that has been likened to Game of Thrones, in which mythical aristocracy and royalty battle for the crown. One member of staff said: 'Inside Google, it's a Game of Thrones'. Pictured: Court meddlers Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish (right) and Varys (left) Google co-founder Sergey Brin was involved in a recent sex scandal after it emerged he was dating Google worker Amanda Rosenberg . The book and series' sex and dangerous liaisons also has similarities to life at Google, according to insiders. The . most famous recent 'scandal' involved married Google co-founder Sergey . Brin who, it emerged last month, had an affair with Google Glass . employee Amanda Rosenberg. She had also previously dated Google executive Hugo Barra, according to reports. Although Google has a written code of conduct involving relationships with colleagues, staff say bosses mostly turn a blind eye. The internet giant's code states: 'If a romantic relationship does create an actual or apparent conflict it may require changes to work arrangements or even the termination of employment of either or both individuals involved. ‘When faced with a potential conflict of interest, ask yourself: Would this activity harm my reputation, negatively impact my ability to do my job at Google or potentially harm Google? Google co-founders Sergey Brin, left, and Larry Page, actively encouraged fierce debate among staff, according to the report . ‘Would this activity embarrass Google or me if it showed up on the front page of a newspaper or blog? If the answer to any of these questions is “yes”, the relationship or situation is likely to create a conflict of interest and you should avoid it.’ However, as Business Insider states, in Douglas Edwards' book about the launch of the company 'I'm Feeling Lucky: The Confessions Of Google Employee Number 59' relationships with co-workers were common. Mr Edwards quotes HR worker Heather Cairns as saying: 'hormones were flying and not everyone remembered to lock their doors.' But as one Google worker told Business Insider: 'In a place like Google, which has strong technical talent as well as business talent, it's very natural that people are going to be attracted to one another.' Google did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.","Business Insider says internet giant filled with sex scandals and politicking .

A Colorado reporter has filed a lawsuit to have the indictment made against the parents of slain JonBenet Ramsey made public more than a decade after it was originally filed. The 1996 murder of the 6-year-old beauty pageant contestant made headlines for years and the latest revelation in the saga was that one of the grand juries called in to examine the case originally felt that the girl's parents were in part responsible for her death. Back in 1999 a Colorado grand jury voted to indict the Ramseys on charges of child abuse resulting in death, a felony that can carry up to 48 years in prison. Sources, including members of the grand jury, told the Boulder Daily Camera in January that the District Attorney at the time, Alex Hunter, refused to sign the indictment vote without giving a public explanation. Instead, the indictment remained sealed and Patsy and John Ramsey were never charged. Now a local journalist and a press advocacy group have filed a lawsuit asserting that the indictment should be made public in the interest in government accountability. 'The plaintiffs believe... that the indictment is a criminal justice record that reflects official action by the grand jury, and accordingly that it is subject to mandatory disclosure upon request,' attorney Thomas Kelley wrote in the formal complaint, as reported in the Daily Camera. Cold case: John and Patsy Ramsey, the parents of murdered beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey, were indicted by a grand jury over her death, but prosecutors refused to press charges, it has been revealed . 'Last picture': JonBenet with her mother, apparently on the morning of her death. Her parents remained suspects in the murder until finally being exonerated in 2008 . The indictment and ensuing lawsuit are just the latest bend in the legal back-and-forth between the criminal justice system and the Ramseys. No charges were ever actually filed against John or Patsy Ramsy, and the same goes for JonBenet's older brother Burke who allegedly slept through her kidnapping and subsequent murder in the family's basement on December 26. Mrs Ramsey died after a battle with ovarian cancer in 2006 and John has since remarried. In . 2008, following the testing of previously unknown DNA found on . JonBenet's underwear, the Boulder District Attorney formally ruled out . any connection between JonBenet's immediate family members and the . murder.

She may have quit competitive riding, but mother-to-be Zara Phillips isn’t afraid of getting her hands dirty. The Queen’s grand-daughter, who is around four months pregnant, spent the day chasing after her horses and even lifting several heavy show-jumping poles at an event on Monday. The 31-year-old royal, a professional three-day eventer with an Olympic silver medal under her belt, had initially insisted she would continue to compete well into her pregnancy when Buckingham Palace announced that she was expecting her first baby with husband Mike Tindall early next year. Scroll down for video . Hands-on: Zara mucks in at an eventing meet at Windsor despite being four-months pregnant . Coach: Zara was full of advice as she put one of her trainee riders through the paces . All smiles: The 31-year-old had no problem lifting fences during the practice session . Safety first: Zara has confirmed she will not take part in any competitive riding events for the rest of her pregnancy . Her decision sparked intense debate as the NHS strongly advises pregnant women not to ride in case they either fall off or get kicked by their horse. There is also a danger of placental rupture, caused by the animal’s jolting. Days later, however, the Mail revealed that Zara had changed her mind and cancelled all her planned rides. A spokesman for Princess Anne’s daughter stressed there was nothing medically wrong and that her pregnancy was proceeding ‘happily and healthily’. But she conceded that the royal’s condition had weighed heavily on her decision to quit, almost a year after she won silver at the London Olympics as part of the British three-day eventing team. Winner: The royal won a silver medal at the London Olympics last year . Relaxed: The NHS advises mothers-to-be not to ride during pregnancy but staying active is beneficial for both mother and baby . Watching on: Onlookers described how Ms Phillips mucked in at the practice session for seven or eight hours . Inspiration: Ms Phillips was full of advice for her young trainees . Happy: The Queen's granddaughter is expecting her first child with England rugby player Mike Tindall . ‘The fact is that all of Zara’s horses have now qualified for the events she wishes to enter them for next year. She has done so well already this season, she does not actually need to compete any more. Given that she is pregnant, she has decided to cancel the rest of her entries for the year,’ they said. Friends have stressed however, that Zara will continue to ride privately as her horses need to be exercised. Still active: Zara took part in a non-competitive riding event last week . ‘It’s business as usual at the yard as far as she is concerned and Zara will continue to ride. She also plans to be back in the saddle as soon as possible after having her baby; she is a professional sportswoman after all,’ they said. And on Monday she was more than happy to help out as her protégée, Aimee Aspinall, competed on her two of her horses at the Smiths Lawn Horse Trials in Windsor Great Park. Zara is apparently keen for her two new mounts, Hanua and Disarm, to continue their training and is taking a hands-on approach to their training. Dressed in jeans, brown work boots and branded gilet which disguised her growing baby bump, the 15th in line to the throne helped to prepare the horses and was even seen lifting a number of hefty show jumping poles back into position. Show-jumping is one of the three disciplines that make up three-day eventing, the other two being cross-country and dressage. An onlooker said: ‘She was out there getting her hands dirty for a good seven or eight hours in some atrocious conditions. You really wouldn’t have thought she was pregnant. Say what you like about the royals, but Zara is clearly no snob. ‘She definitely isn’t the type to sit around drinking tea.’ It is understood that Zara plans to keep involved in this way throughout her pregnancy and intends to be back in the saddle as soon as possible after giving birth, with a view to training for the 2016 Brazil Olympics team. Zara is only too aware of the dangers of eventing, though, having broken her collar bone when she came off her horse Tsunami II in France in 2008. The horse broke its neck and was killed in the fall. Her close friend and world-class rider Sherelle Duke, died while competing in 2006 and a week later Zara dedicated her victory at the World Equestrian Games to her. But riders such as Britain’s Mary King, who won six team golds at the world eventing championships, competed until she was five and a half months pregnant.","Pictured lifting fences and preparing horses during practice session .

She noted the significance of her nomination on the 50th anniversary of her father's presidency, focusing on his tenure rather than on John F. Kennedy's assassination on Nov. 22, 1963.

'I am conscious of my responsibility to uphold the ideals he represented — a deep commitment to public service, a more just America and a more peaceful world,' Kennedy said. 'As a World War II veteran who served in the Pacific, he had hoped to be the first sitting president to make a state visit to Japan. If confirmed as ambassador, I would be humbled to carry forward his legacy in a small way and represent the powerful bonds that unite our two democratic societies.' Kennedy faced gentle questioning from Republicans and Democrats on the committee, signaling that she faced no obstacles to confirmation. Her hearing lasted about an hour and 20 minutes. 'You have a good sense of what national interests are,' said Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the senior Republican on the panel. Corker told Kennedy she would be a 'great ambassador.' Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia noted the unusual symmetry: President Kennedy was honored for his military service fighting Japanese naval forces during World War II; decades later, his daughter would be the top diplomat in Japan, now a close ally. Kaine said it was reminder that hostilities need not be permanent. Kennedy family members depart the Capitol in this November 1963 photo.

If confirmed, she would be the first woman in a post from which many other prominent Americans have served to strengthen a vital Asian tie. New York's two senators, Democrats Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, introduced Kennedy to the committee. Schumer noted that Kennedy and her daughter Tatiana made a three-mile swim in the Hudson River last weekend for charity, swimming from Nyack to Sleepy Hollow.

Caroline Kennedy helped propel Obama to the Democratic presidential nomination with her endorsement over Hillary Rodham Clinton — the only time she's endorsed a presidential candidate other than her uncle Ted in 1980. Japan is one of the United States' most important commercial and military partners and has been accustomed since the end of World War II to having renowned American political leaders serve as envoy. Former U.S. ambassadors to Japan include former Vice President Walter Mondale, former House Speaker Tom Foley and former Senate Majority Leaders Mike Mansfield and Howard Baker.

Kennedy's confirmation to the post by the Senate would bring a third generation of her family into the U.S. diplomatic corps. Her grandfather Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. was President Franklin D. Roosevelt's ambassador to Britain, while her aunt Jean Kennedy Smith was ambassador to Ireland under President Bill Clinton. Caroline Kennedy was five days shy of her sixth birthday when her father was killed, and she lived most of the rest of her life in New York City. She earned a bachelor's degree from Harvard University, got a law degree from Columbia University, married exhibit designer Edwin Schlossberg and had three children. She would have to leave her husband and children to live in Japan if she is appointed ambassador. Kennedy is president of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation and chairs the senior advisory committee of the Institute of Politics at Harvard. She has served on the boards of numerous nonprofit organizations, helped raise millions of dollars for New York schools and edited numerous bestselling books on history, law and poetry. She considered running for political office after Clinton resigned the New York Senate seat to serve as Obama's secretary of state. But Kennedy eventually withdrew herself from consideration to fill the seat, once held by her uncle Robert F. Kennedy, citing unspecified personal reasons.","Kennedy, 55, noted the significance of her nomination on the 50th anniversary of her father's presidency .

Hard worker: Alex Gibson, despite her dyslexia, has now secured a first class law degree and beaten her former employer at a 8-day tribunal . A bullied secretary quit her job to study a law degree so she could take on her bosses in court after being inspired by the Oscar-winning film about campaigner Erin Brockovich. Alex Gibson resigned from her £16,000-a-year job after being repeatedly taunted over her dyslexia and disabilities from a biking accident. With no money to pay for a solicitor, the 36-year-old instead decided to enrol on a law degree and fight for justice herself. Yesterday she was enjoying a double celebration, after winning her discrimination case and graduating from university with first-class honours. Her story mirrors that of Erin Brockovich who, despite having no legal training, managed to teach herself law and take on a huge US corporation in a multi-million pound lawsuit. Her victory was made into a movie starring Julia Roberts in 2000. Miss Gibson said: ‘I was distraught and couldn’t believe the way I’d been treated, so was determined that I would defend myself and get justice. ‘I got my inspiration from the Erin Brockovich film. She won against all the odds and I was determined to do the same. I’m just happy I stood up to the bullies and I won.’ Miss Roberts won an Oscar for her portrayal of Miss Brockovich, 53, an environmental activist who in the 1990s proved a major Californian energy firm was poisoning a town’s water supply. Miss Gibson’s ordeal began in October 2010 when she secured a job as a clerical worker in an office in her home town of Bangor, north Wales. Battle: Campaigner Erin Brockovich was played by Julia Roberts . The former hospitality and operations manager had been left permanently disabled after a serious biking accident in Bolivia two years earlier, which meant she had to wear an arm brace. She claimed that within a few weeks of starting work her line manager made a hurtful and discriminatory comment about her arm. When she complained, she was told she needed ‘counselling’ to come to terms with her disability. The problems got worse when bosses ordered her to take minutes of their monthly meetings, a task outside Miss Gibson’s original job remit which she found difficult because of her dyslexia. She said: ‘I couldn’t keep up and I was ridiculed in front of all my colleagues. ‘The stress gave me anxiety problems. My hair fell out and I couldn’t sleep. I was throwing up before work. I resigned shortly after and started to build a case – I wasn’t going to let them get away with it.’ She began studying law at Bangor University in 2011 and represented herself in the employment tribunal hearing in February last year, successfully arguing she had been the victim of disability discrimination and harassment. She has been offered a four-figure sum, but is appealing to increase this. Under the terms of the settlement she cannot name the firm she worked for. Miss Gibson was only able to complete her degree – condensed into two years – after receiving specialist support for her disability from the university. A spokesman for Bangor University congratulated Miss Gibson on her graduation, in July, and her court victory, adding: ‘Starting university presented a much bigger challenge for Alex than most.’ Tough: Alex claims she was bullied out of her job following a mountain bike accident, which left her in hospital . Hurtful: The keen cyclist had to wear an arm brace to work, but she was told by one boss she should had to remove it .","Alex Gibson couldn't afford legal fees so enrolled onto a law course .

When an elderly miner claimed to have found a vein of semi-precious stone in 1945, it was dismissed by many as an old miner's tale. John Royse promised to reveal the exact location to Peter Harrison, then 19, but died before he could take him to the site. Now, seventy years after searching, Mr Harrison's grandson has finally discovered the lost seam of Blue John stone in the picturesque Peak District's Hope Valley. Discovery: Seventy years after searching, Peter Harrison (left) and his grandson John Turner (right) have the semi-precious stone in their hands . Mr Harrison, who is now 87, and his family spent seven decades searching for the deposit. It was his grandson, John Turner, 21, who finally found the stone after noticing something unusual in the floor of the Treak Cliff Cavern. Mr Turner, who has been learning about mining for Blue John stone, said: 'After an hour of digging through muddy deposits I was amazed to come across an old piece of carpet supported by some wooden batons. 'I couldn't believe my eyes when we pulled away the old carpet and there was this most amazing deposit of Blue John stone. 'It was right under the ladder that my grandfather put in decades ago. He must have walked over John Royse's old find thousands of times over the years.' John Turner learnt how to mine for Blue John stone after his grandfather told him about the treasure . Peter Harrison was told by a miner in 1945 that the rare seam existed in the Peak District . Mr Harrison, whose family took over the running of the cavern in 1945, said: 'When my grandson telephoned to tell me that he had found John Royse's old deposit, I couldn't believe it. 'After all these years it was right under my feet. I'm 87 now and retired years ago but, when I heard the news, I just had to put on my old mining overalls and make the trip back into the cavern to see the deposit for myself. 'The old miner John Royse was not in the best of health and was retiring. He told me of this fantastic deposit of Blue John he had found and asked me to help him get it out. 'We planned to return to the cavern the next day but sadly John Royse was taken ill and died. Over the years I have spent countless hours searching for that deposit.' Precious: A tray of resin treated Blue John stone found in the Peak District . Blue John is made from fluorspar which has reacted with other chemicals to give it its distinctive banded streaks. The mineral was formed millions of years ago, although only a small quantity is allowed to be mined each year. Treak Cliff Cavern has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is a show cave featuring spectacular stalactite formations. It is one of only two working Blue John mines in the world, providing the stone for jewellery and ornaments - much of which is hand-crafted in workshops on site. Telling the truth: John Royce in the Treak Cliff Cavern in the 1940s . Vicky Turner, Mr Harrison's daughter and Mr Turner's mother, now manages Treak Cliff Cavern. She said: 'I grew up with stories of John Royse's lost deposit. To be honest I thought it might have been a bit of an old miner's tale. 'If my father hadn't found it after all these years, maybe it didn't exist. It is a fantastic discovery. John is learning the trade and has a great eye for it, it must be in his blood. 'It is a sizeable deposit and we conservatively estimate that there is enough Blue John stone in this deposit to keep us busy for the next decade at least.'","Elderly miner promised to reveal location of the Blue John stone to Peter Harrison .

A group called DoSomething.org has launched a website where students can post photos of the most unappetizing lunch offerings from their schools. It is called Fed Up and, like all projects taken on by the non-profit, it aims to empower young people to make positive changes in the world. Along with the pictures, grossed out teens can vent their frustration with sarcastic captions that sum up just what makes each dish so unpalatable. Brain food? A new website allows school kids nationwide to upload photos of their most unappetizing school lunches. This gruel was uploaded by a student at Jubilee Academy in Texas . Mission: The site was started by DoSomething.org, a non-profit dedicated to empowering young people to make positive changes in the world . Those who visit the blog-style site can approve of, or condemn each photo via Eat It or Toss It buttons. According to Farah Sheikh, who runs Fed Up, the idea for the project came from a study that sought to understand why students drop out of school. ‘The obvious reasons, like bad grades and needing to support their families with a job, came up,’ Sheikh told Today. ‘But we started realizing that nutrition in school plays a huge role in ability to perform. Have you ever eaten a fried food lunch and felt the effects afterwards? For some students, they have no choice but to feel that way after a meal.’ Unappetizing: Many examples, like this lunch from Dearborn High School in Dearborn, Michigan with what appears to be pizza, are downright disgusting . Tossing your lunch: The site allows users to upload photos like these, and also to vote each photo as Eat It or Toss It . Tasty! The uploader of this photo from Cherokee High School in Georgia noted the light seasoning of human hair atop what may or may not be pizza . Quippy: Many of the uploads come with sarcastic, though occasionally flattering, remarks about the food items from the students . Salty: Part of the USDA's Healthy, Hunger-Free kids initiative stipulates that high school lunches must contain less than 740 milligrams of sodium . Fatty: The USDA also stipulates that school lunches contain less fat than they once could . Fed Up has received thousands of submissions in the week or so since it launched. And the photos have received a combined 30,000 votes. ‘We've learned that young people care,’ Sheikh says. ‘They want to see change, and up until now haven't known how to voice their opinions.’ Users will be able to post photos and vote through November 15. Once voting closes, DoSomething.org will compile the data and create infographic maps that show where the best and worst lunches in America are served. Alfredon't: Farah Sheikh, who runs Fed Up, fears that fattening, fried foods are compounding the problem of poor student performance in schools . The funny captions hide a bitter truth about American school lunches. Despite new legislation aimed at making them healthier, around two thirds of American school lunches exceed recommended fat content and most exceed recommended sodium content . One potato, two potato? What appear to be tater tots at left are actually chicken nuggets . Healthier: The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 established new standards for all foods sold in schools with an emphasis on more veggies and fewer calories . WHAT'S BEING DONE . In 2010, the USDA instituted the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. The initiative is a pet project of first lady Michelle Obama, who has made childhood obesity her signature issue. The new regulations have a calorie cap and require that school meals include only one portion of meat or protein. They also stipulate that milk be either skim or one percent fat and that bread be ‘brown wheat.’ In an effort to curb obesity, carbohydrates like French fries may only be served in three-fourths of a cup portions and kids in elementary school—where the complaints mostly seem to originate—may only be served a total of 650 calories per meal. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT . The government estimates that . around two thirds of school meals exceed the fat content limits. Most . lunches are believed to exceed the sodium limits. Meanwhile, some 21 million students relied on school lunches as their primary meal of the day last year. And at least a third of American children and adolescents are overweight or obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Farah Sheikh, who heads up Fed Up, fears that American students are losing out in part because of fattening school lunches. 'Hard ham and cheese': This ham and cheese comes from an Arizona high school . Hopeful: Sheikh hopes the Fed Up project will help improve school performance and alleviate the childhood obesity epidemic . Bot all bad: Not all of the photos are uploaded by students angry at the quality of their school lunches. Some actually praise them, though the majority of votes are likely of the negative variety . Useful: Fed Up intends to take data it collects from the site and turn it into an infographic handout for schools and nutritionists .",A non-profit called DoSomething.org aimed at empowering kids has created Fed Up so they can showcase the worst of school lunches in an effort to educate the public about what kids are eating .

When Marco Pierre White chose to repaint his 15th century hotel a shade of pink, he perhaps thought it would add to the colourful palette used on old buildings in Suffolk villages. But the chef is being forced to repaint his historic hotel after locals complained that the Grade-II listed building looked like 'blancmange' as he has not used the traditional Suffolk Pink. Villagers had asked planning officials to investigate after the outside walls of the Angel Hotel, which dominates the market place in the medieval village of Lavenham, were changed from cream to pink. One of the upset local residents said: 'It looks as if someone has got their history badly wrong - Suffolk pink is a traditional colour here and has been for centuries. But it is not that chocolate-box pink that people think it is. 'Real Suffolk Pink dates back to the 14th century or earlier. Then paints were coloured using whatever was to hand, and ox-blood was used to produce the colour properly recognised as Suffolk Pink. 'There is a rich pageant of old colours in this village - from red to yellow and rust to mustard -  and frankly the Angel looked ridiculous pink. 'It has changed colour over the years but no-one here can remember it being such a twee colour.' Another resident who lives just yards from the Angel said: 'It is a ghastly inappropriate colour and totally out of place in the middle of so many other buildings painted in proper sympathetic heritage colours. 'The job was done in a couple of days using cheap trade paint that was just slapped on - it's not even lime-wash which is what should be used on property in Lavenham.' Parish council chairman Roy Whitworth, who once ran the Angel which Mr Pierre White took over two years ago, said: 'Villagers were generally appalled by the new colour - no-one liked it.' Blancmange: Residents have fiercely criticised the celebrity chef's choice of colour, which they say looks like the famous dessert . Mr Pierre White upset villagers within days of taking over the hotel and pub when he refused to serve lager or Guinness, claiming it encouraged the wrong sort of people to the establishment, which was built as a tavern in around 1420. 'People here are already fairly cheesed off with Mr White because of the changes he made at the Angel and they would be very upset if he was allowed to get away with things,' said Mr Whitworth. The controversial cook also made the headlines earlier this year when a judge branded him a 'wealthy idiot'. Last night the hotel confirmed that the hotel would be repainted. Manager Rob Jackson said: 'The building needed freshening up and Marco chose the colour but we have agreed to change it and instead have a much darker pink. 'We didn't need permission to change the colour but we are happy to change it and use one recommended by English Heritage.' That's more like it: This Grade II cottage in the coastal village of Stutton has been decorated with proper Suffolk Pint paint .","Outraged residents have rounded on the celebrity chef over choice of paint .

But it can be hard for petite yet athletic women like Victoria to find perfectly fitting jeans.

As a proud hunter who enjoys the outdoor lifestyle, Paul Ryan's appeal to the base of the Republican Party is thought to have been one of the main reasons why Mitt Romney chose the self-styled action man for his presidential ticket. So when the Wisconsin Congressman was photographed in Cincinnati yesterday buying his 10-year-old daughter camouflage gear for a hunting expedition this Fall to go along with the rifle he got her last Christmas, the outrage from liberal's condemning the father-daughter trip was all too predictable. But the backlash against father-of-three Ryan has been met with a remarkable counter-backlash from gun enthusiasts across the country who have taken to Twitter to post pictures of their little girls posing with rifles, automatic weapons and hand guns supporting the GOP politicians right to introduce his daughter to firearms. Greg Hollinger's daughter with a Second Amendment rifle . Gary Hollinger took to Twitter after Michelle Malkin tweeted in support of Paul Ryan shopping for hunting gear for his daughter . The small army of support began when Fox News contributor Michelle Malkin spoke up in favour of Ryan and tweeted that she had taken her 12-year daughter shooting for her birthday and that 'Self-defence is one of the best gifts you can give a girl.' This invited hundreds of dads, mothers and supporters of the Second Amendment to come forward to share their memories and pictures of learning to shoot from their father or of teaching their girl to fire a gun. One proud parent with the Twitter name @OffACough uploaded a picture of his 13-year-old daughter with her Remington 870 shotgun and the 20-pound turkey that she had just killed and that she was going to eat before heading off to the mall to buy some shoes. Michelle Malkin's tweet that started the whole backlash against the backlash is replied to by Randy Janinda who also tweeted his daughter at the shooting range on her 16th birthday . Randy Janinda's daughter spent her 16th birthday at the firing range and tweeted this picture in support of Paul Ryan . Jeff Gill's 12-year-old daughter still needs to work on her grip according to the tweet he posted supporting Paul Ryan . Some of the tweets from individuals were in defence of their constitutional rights, with Rob O'Donnell putting pictures on the social networking site of his two girls with semi-automatic weapons stating, 'it's not only my right, but my duty to share and teach the love of shooting with my daughters.' One father, Matt McCracken, decided to put a sweet picture of his little girl holding a rifle almost as tall as her onto Twitter, stating that 'this is my daughter age 10 learning gun safety.' In addition to dads standing up for Paul Ryan, daughters got in on the act too. Stephanie Janiczek tweeted, 'My Papa bought me my first shotgun, a Remington MDL 1100 with a full choke barrell when I was twelve. Got first buck with it.' Standing with a gun almost as tall as her, Matt McCracken's daughter is ten-year-old - the same age as Liza Ryan . Rob O'Donnell claimed it was his duty to support his daughters learning how to shoot - just like like Paul Ryan . An avid hunter and outdoorsman, Paul Ryan somewhat expectedly found himself under attack when he took a break from a bus tour through Ohio to shop at Outdoor World for 15 minutes to buy his 10-year-old ddaughter Liza camouflage gear. He told the reporters who followed him that he is going to take her deer hunting this fall in Wisconsin and Oklahoma, which is where his wife's family lives. 'She's going to get to go hunting this year for the first time,' said Ryan, who has previously told the press that he bought his daughter a Remington 700. 243 junior model rifle last Christmas. 'She's 10-years-old, so she can hunt starting at 10. 'She's been getting ready, she's been practicing. 'I just need to get her some clothes.' The controversy started after Paul Ryan was seen to buy his ten-year-old daughter hunting gear while he took a break from campaigning in Ohio . Buying his girl gloves and a jacket for $101.14, Ryan has spoken at length in the past about his love of American outdoor pursuits. He has pointedly said 'Hey, I'm a Catholic deer hunter. I am happy to be clinging to my guns and my religion', which is a dig at President Obama who made a campaign speech in San Francisco in 2008 in which he said some voters, 'cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them.' But in comparison to his boss, Paul Ryan is a big-game hunter comparable to Theodore Roosevelt. 'I'm not a big-game hunter. I've made that very clear. I've always been a rodent and rabbit hunter. Small varmints, if you will,' said Mitt Romney in 2008, during his first unsuccessful tilt at the U.S. presidency. Republican vice presidential Paul Ryan waves as he walks with his (L-R) son Sam, daughter Liza, wife Janna, son Charlie and mother Betty Douglas after accepting the nomination during the third session of the 2012 Republican National Convention . Paul Ryan has described himself as a Catholic deer hunter who is happy to cling to his guns and religion . The support for Ryan, 42, followed the initial backlash his shopping trip for his daughter first provoked. One Twitter user, Troy Martez took to the site to post the message that 'Aww! There's nothing sweeter than a Dad and a daughter bonding over the body of a dead animal they probably won't eat.' Another user called @nschim posted: 'Ryan gets daughter a rifle??? Maybe its for her shotgun wedding if she is not allowed to use birth control.' According to an interview with Deer & Hunting magazine, Ryan 'shoots a Mathews Z7Xtreme compound and loves the thrill of bow-hunting, but also enjoys firearms.' 'My daughter she's been hunting with me for years, watching me, but she's old enough this year to hunt on her own. 'She's really looking forward to it.' An earlier version of this article carried a caption that suggested the girl in the first image was holding a military grade assault rifle.  We are happy to clarify that this is not the case.","Parents take to Twitter to support the Republican vice-presidential candidate who received criticism online for buying hunting equipment for his 10-year-old daughter .

An ivory toothbrush belonging to the last emperor of Brazil is among 200,000 objects that have been unearthed at an excavation site in Rio de Janeiro. A team of archeologists has been painstakingly scrapping away the soil at the site in the north of the capital, near the former imperial palace, ever since it was discovered by engineers building an extension to the underground rail network. The haul, which contains artefacts spanning the 17th to 19th century, also includes minty toothpaste made by a chemist in Europe for the Queen of Portugal, Maria of Saboiai, a water bottle made for the Royal Family, and vessels still full of unidentified liquids. Royal teeth: This ivory toothbrush once belonged to Dom Pedro II, the last emperor of Brazil . Minty: This white pot is believed to have contained toothpaste for the Queen of Portugal Maria of Saboiaî . Jigsaw: Archeologist and team leader Claudio Prado de Mello cleans a partially recovered porcelain plate . Wealthy owners: Silver spoons, coins and even jewellery have all been found in good condition . Last emperor: Dom Pedro II, the Magnanimous . Brazil's last monarch, Dom Pedro II, was born in Rio in 1825, the seventh child of Dom Pedro I. He . came to the throne at the tender age of just six, when his . father suddenly abdicated and left the country for Europe. A slavery abolitionist, Dom Pedro II came to be known simply as the Magnanimous during the course of his reign. Although . many Brazilian landowners at the time owned slaves, Dom Pedro II was not . one of them, and in 1871 he presided over a bill that ruled all children . born to slave women would be free. But . during the 1880s there was a groundswell of support among civilian . republicans to overthrow the monarchy, and in 1889 a coup d'etat was . launched. It led to tje abdication of Dom Pedro II and his . family, who went into exile in Europe. The last emperor of Brazil died two years later in 1891. More than two dozen archeologists and historians have been working at the site since it was first discovered in March. The plot was once home to a slaughterhouse, and is also believed to have been used by the Imperial Family as a rubbish tip. Team leader Claudio Prado de Mello said not only has the find yielded a large quantity of objects, many are in remarkably good condition. He told website Journal Review Online: 'What is the most . impressive is the intact state of many objects. 'In . archaeology we usually find very fragmented pieces, but this time we're . finding whole objects.' The . ivory toothbrush is one of the more coveted items as it is belonged to Dom Pedro II, who ruled . over Brazil between 1831 and 1889. Chemist: The toothpaste porcelain pots were made by a firm with branches in London and Paris . Bottles: Thousands of glass and ceramic bottles and containers have been recovered from the site . Intact: While these spittoons may be cracked and broken, many of the items are in excellent condition . Inscribed: The writing on this glass water bottle offers proof it was used by the Royal household . Painstaking: Archeologist Luiza Gomes washes a porcelain plate fragment that was recovered from the site . The ivory brush has turned brown with age and its boar bristles have all but disappeared. But there is no doubt that it once polished the Royal's teeth given its inscription: 'His Majesty the . Emperor of Brazil.' A round white porcelain container inscribed with the words 'to the . Queen of Portugal Maria of Saboia'  may have once contained mint-flavoured toothpaste, according to the team. The chemist that made it had offices in London and Paris. Dozens of glass and ceramic bottles have been found at the site, along with six sealed bottles that still contain unidentified liquids. These are destined for the laboratory, where scientists will try to reveal what they are. And dozens of . coins and pipes were also found, along with a golden ring and a tie . tack. The excavation site has now been covered over while work continues to build the metro extension in time for the Olympic Games in 2016. But once it is finished, the team will be back to continue their work that could shed new light on the life of the nation's last and arguably best-loved rulers.

That was the last time she would ever . hear her husband's voice. According to KSPR, 20 . policemen, firefighters and a few neighbors from the small community . made up mostly of military families, spent several hours searching for . Powelson, who trained Military Police officers at Fort Leonard Wood. They eventually found the young marine early on Tuesday morning, dead at the bottom of a 70ft unmarked sinkhole. Pulaski . County Sheriff, Ron Long told the station that during the search . 'several firefighters' and deputies came close to falling into the . sinkhole before finding Powelson's body.

Books can transport readers with a good imagination to faraway lands simply through the power of language. But it seems some novels can transport their fans in reality, too. A survey found we are often persuaded to visit places across the world because they are the settings of our favourite novels. Breakfast at Tiffany’s by Truman Capote topped the list, inspiring readers to take a trip to New York. The book, published in 1958, features Manhattan society girl Holly Golightly, who was played by Audrey Hepburn in the 1961 movie. Big Apple: Breakfast at Tiffany's, which was made into the now iconic movie version in 1961, inspires Britons to travel to New York . In a poll, 37 per cent – all women – said the author had convinced them to visit the Big Apple. The survey by High Street discount store The Works found the second most popular book destination – and the top choice for men – was JRR Tolkien’s Lord Of The Rings. Some 15 per cent had travelled to New Zealand, where the movie was shot. Third in the list was Alex Garland’s The Beach, set in Thailand, followed by JK Rowling’s Harry Potter, which was partly filmed at Alnwick Castle in Northumberland. Other choices included Victor Hugo’s The Hunchback of Notre Dame in Paris and Louis de Bernieres’s Captain Corelli’s Mandolin, a vivid portrayal of the Greek island Kefalonia. Magic is real: JK Rowling¿s Harry Potter has inspired people to visit Alnwick Castle in Northumberland which served as set for Hogwarts . Kevin Keaney, chief executive of The Works, said: ‘It’s great to see that people are still reading and getting carried away to another world, both metaphorically and literally, it would appear, by fantastic and inspiring novels. ‘We love the fact reading is accessible enough for everyone to get involved in it as an activity and, if it inspires Brits to be more adventurous with their holiday choices, that’s no bad thing either.’ Holiday-maker Joanna Benson, 32, of Harrow, north west London, said: ‘I love Breakfast at Tiffany’s - both the book and the movie - and I went to New York when I was 20 to see the place for myself. ‘Books often inspire me to go off on a trip and I’ve been Kefalonia twice since reading Captain Corelli’s Mandolin.’","Popular novels inspire travelling to locations where they are set .

Syrian President Bashar al Assad has maintained that he is defending his people from outside terrorist groups, saying that the country's war is one that is helping his people on the whole. The doctor-turned-dictator was asked to compare his role in ordering the government forces to attack the rebels is similar to that of a surgeon getting rid of destructive portions of a sick person's body. 'Doctors take the right decisions to protect the life of the patient because you can't say they don't do harm physically,' he said during an interview with Fox News, making a reference to the Hippocratic oath that all doctors. Indignant: Syrian President Bashar al Assad used his latest televised interview to say that there is still no evidence that his soldiers used chemical weapons . 'The same for a politician: a doctor deals with one patient and the politicians deal with the public. 'The question is whether your decision should help the lives of the Syrians or not. Nobody likes the violence... but what do you do when the terrorists attack your government?' During a televised interview with Fox . News that aired Wednesday night, the Syrian President rejected the . findings of the United Nations report that declared that an attack . involving sarin gas did occur in the country on August 21. First due no harm: Assad was asked about the Hippocratic Oath he was forced to take as a doctor, and if that applied to him as a politician . He did not deny that the attack occurred- saying that 'it's despicable, it's a crime'- but he did clearly try to distance his forces from any culpability. 'Sarin gas is called the kitchen gas you know why? because you can make it anywhere,' he said. Assad said that the evidence cited in the United Nations report was not all of the proof and did not prove that the weapons were used by his armed forces. 'They have the samples and they're supposed to be objective... the information is different than evidence,' he said of the UN report. 'No one has verified the credibility of the video and the pictures. the only verified things are the samples from victims. 'You cannot build a report on videos, its not verified. You have a lot of forgery on the internet,' he said making a clear reference to the videos of dying victims that the CIA made publicly available first to Senators and Congressmen but then also to the American public when President Obama was building his case for a retaliatory missile attack. The interview marks the second that the Syrian President has approved with Western journalists since the August 21 chemical weapons attack outside of Damascus. The first was with Charlie Rose for . CBS and the interview that aired today on Fox News was arranged through . former Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich. During . the interview with Rose, Assad did not say whether his government was . in control of chemical weapons and during the Fox interview he said that . they clearly do since they have agreed to the international proposal to . turn over their stockpile. Sit down: Assad was interviewed by former Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich (left) and Fox News reporter Greg Palkot (next to Kucinich) inside the Presidential palace in Damascus . 'It's not a secret anymore,' Assad said. 'We never said no, we never said yes but we always say it is a classified issue.' During the hour-long interview, Assad maintained that he did not necessarily agree with the number of fatalities that have occurred since the onslaught of the civil war in Syria two years ago- nor did he even agree that it should be categorized as a civil war. He said that the large number of missing individuals makes it impossible for there to be a firm number of more than 100,000 people killed in the country- which has been widely accepted by Western governments as well as the United Nations. ‘We have tens of thousands of Syrians who have died... mainly because of terrorists and bombs,’ he said. 'We have thousands of missing people, we don't know if they're dead or not dead....This is a human tragedy its not about numbers. 'I cannot minimize it (the death toll) because in every house you have pain today, in every house your have sadness.' Under attack: Assad maintained that the government was continually being attacked by outside terrorist groups who are masquerading as internal opposition forces . Assad continually asserted that the rebels and opposition forces originate from outside of Syria, claiming that his country embraces opposition and allows them to exist since they have ‘grassroots’ in the homeland. The people fighting Syrian government forces now, Assad said, are funded and come from other countries and the large majority of them- 80 to 90 per cent- have ties to al Qaeda. ‘What we have is not civil war what we have is war but it’s a new kind of war,’ he said. 'We are defending our country. if you do not defend, this number will be many fold,' he said of the disputed death count.' Assad said that in spite of the months of heated rhetoric and outright threats from the United States, he does not see America as opposition- even though he previously said that the country should 'expect everything' if President Obama did order a missile strike against Syria. 'We never looked at the United States as (an) enemy,' Assad said in Tuesday's interview. 'First of all the United States because they're the greatest country in the world, that's self evident... we want to have good relations of course.' He went on to say that once an international agreement is settled regarding the collection and destruction of the Syrian nuclear weapons, he will make sure that it will be put into effect. 'We want to fully cooperate with this agreement, not partially,' Assad said. Horror: The Obama administration has released a series of videos (pictured)of the victims from the August 21 attack, but in today's interview Assad said there is no way to know the video is not a fake . Attacks: The chemical gas attacks occurred on August 21 in the rebel strongholds near Demascus and was thought to have left more than 1,000 dead . There is a tentatively-scheduled . presidential election in Syria in the spring of next year, and while he . 'won' his last election with 97.6 per cent of the vote in 2007, he said . that the people should feel fully entitled to nominate a different . candidate if they do not like his leadership. In spite of the ongoing war, he maintains that his rule is still a good one for his people. 'I . would say I am the hope of the Syrians... Other states- they are much . farther from democracy than the Syrian state,' Assad said. The hour-long . Fox interview took place on Tuesday inside the presidential palace in . Damascus but aired on Wednesday evening in the United States. The interview was taped by a Syrian news crew but Clemente was in the control room at the time and it was aired in full on Fox. 'On Saturday, Sept. 7, ... Dennis Kucinich advised me that he believed he could secure an interview with … Assad, whom he had met on previous occasions,' Fox executive vice president of news Michael Clemente said in a statement to Politico. 'At the time, it appeared that an American military attack on Syria was imminent, and I decided that Kucinich should pursue the interview, on condition that Fox News journalists would also be included.' Mr Kucinich has worked for Fox as a contributor since January, but during the interview he was accompanied by the network's Middle East correspondent Greg Palkot.","Syrian President admitted that 'it's not a secret' that they have chemical weapons but said that they will agree to hand them over to be destroyed .

American scientists have recreated the world's most famous painting on the world's smallest canvas, which measures just 30 microns in width. The Mona Lisa, originally painted by Leonardo da Vinci, has now been 'painted' on a substrate measuring one third of the width of a human hair, using tiny chemical reactions. The scientists believe 'Micro Lisa' demonstrates a technique that could potentially be used to achieve nanomanufacturing of devices as they were able to vary the surface concentration of molecules on such short-length scales. Researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology have created the 'Mini Lisa' on a substrate surface approximately 30 microns in width. The image demonstrates a technique that could potentially be used to achieve nano-manufacturing of devices . The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, which is the best known and most parodied painting in the world . The famous image was re-created with an atomic force microscope and a process called ThermoChemical NanoLithography (TCNL). Going pixel by pixel, scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology positioned a heated cantilever at the substrate surface to create a series of confined nanoscale chemical reactions. By varying only the heat at each location, PhD Candidate Keith Carroll controlled the number of new molecules that were created - the greater the heat, the greater the local concentration. More heat produced the lighter shades of grey, as seen on the Mini Lisa's forehead and hands. Less heat produced the darker shades in her dress and hair, which can be seen when the molecular canvas is visualised using fluorescent dye. Each pixel is spaced by 125 nanometers. Jennifer Curtis, an associate professor in the School of Physics and lead author of the study that was published in journal Langmuir, said: 'By tuning the temperature, our team . manipulated chemical reactions to yield variations in the molecular . concentrations on the nanoscale. 'The spatial confinement of these . reactions provides the precision required to generate complex chemical . images like the Mini Lisa.' The famous image was re-created with an atomic force microscope (pictured) and a process called ThermoChemical NanoLithography (TCNL). Going pixel by pixel, scientists positioned a heated cantilever at the substrate surface to create a series of confined nanoscale chemical reactions . Production of chemical concentration gradients and variations on the sub-micrometre scale are difficult to achieve with other techniques. The scientists produced chemical gradients of amine groups, but expect the process could be extended for use with other materials. Professor Curtis said: ""We envision TCNL will be capable of patterning gradients of other physical or chemical properties, such as conductivity of graphene. Professor Curtis (pictured) said technique should enable a wide range of previously inaccessible experiments and applications in fields as diverse as nanoelectronics, optoelectronics and bioengineering . 'This technique should enable a wide range of previously inaccessible experiments and applications in fields as diverse as nanoelectronics, optoelectronics and bioengineering.' She said another advantage is that atomic force microscopes are fairly common and the thermal control is relatively straightforward, making the approach accessible to both academic and industrial laboratories. To facilitate their vision of nano-manufacturing devices with TCNL, the Georgia Tech team has recently integrated nanoarrays of five thermal cantilevers to accelerate the pace of production. Because the technique provides high spatial resolutions at a speed faster than other existing methods, even with a single cantilever, Professor Curtis is hopeful that TCNL will provide the option of nanoscale printing integrated with the fabrication of large quantities of surfaces and everyday materials, whose dimensions are more than one billion times larger than the TCNL features themselves.","The tiny picture is 'painted' on a substrate that is just 30 microns in width using tiny chemical reactions .

This is the woman at the centre of a love triangle that saw one of the Queen’s riders brutally attack a former PR director of the Jockey Club. Genevieve Hippisley, 26, was at her new home late one night when her ex-boyfriend Jonathan Nolan showed up and caught one of his friends there. Nolan, 32, a work rider for the Queen’s trainer Sir Michael Stoute, had been living with Miss Hippisley in Newmarket, but she ended their relationship and moved out. When he paid an unannounced visit to her new flat in the town on July 21, he was shocked to find his friend John Maxse, 45, with her. Nolan attacked Mr Maxse and left him with a suspected broken eye socket, broken collarbone and broken nose. Appearing at Ipswich Crown Court, Nolan pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm with intent. Judge Rupert Overbury told him: ‘Be under no illusion that the likely prospect is that you will be going to prison.’ He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Nolan claimed he acted in self-defence. Andrew Shaw, defending, added: ‘Mr Nolan is absolutely adamant that he was not aware that Mr Maxse was at the address when he went there.’ Mr Maxse, a former jockey, is a prominent figure in horse racing, working as PR director for the British Horseracing Authority and Jockey Club. He now works as a consultant for Qatar Racing. He also rides out for trainer Michael Bell, for whom Miss Hippisley is a work rider. Genevieve Hippisley and Jonathan Nolan. Nolan has apparently attached Maxse after he found him with his ex-girlfriend . It is thought  Mr Maxse knew Miss Hippisley through his friendship with Nolan, but the pair became closer at Mr Bell’s yard. Nolan is a work rider at Sir Michael’s Freemason Lodge Stables. He used to ride the Queen’s horse Carlton House when it was trained there. Since the attack Mr Maxse and Miss Hippisley have exchanged flirty Twitter messages. Mr Maxse has been seen with injuries such as a black eye, thought to have been caused by the attack .

Federal health officials are mourning the death of a North Carolina woman featured prominently in a graphic government ad campaign to get people to stop smoking. Terrie Hall died Monday of cancer at a hospital in Winston-Salem. She was 53. 'She was a public health hero,' said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which conducted the campaign. 'She may well have saved more lives than most doctors do.' Scroll down for video . Tragic: Terrie Hall, pictured, passed away on Monday after suffering throat cancer . A diseased former smoker whose voice box was removed years ago, Hall took a leading role in the campaign that showed how smoking-related cancer ravages the body. Officials believe the campaign led as many as 100,000 Americans smokers to quit. Hall's first spot showed the former school cheerleader putting in false teeth and covering her stoma with her scarf. It was the campaign's most popular spot by far, receiving more than 2.8 million views on YouTube — more than any other CDC video ever posted online. Hall, a resident of Lexington, was featured repeatedly in the 'Tips from Former Smokers' ad campaign. Graphic: The North Carolina woman featured prominently in the graphic government ad campaign, pictured, to get people to stop smoking . Sad: In an ad for this year's version of the campaign, Hall addressed the camera in the buzzing sound of her electrolarynx, pictured . It was the federal public health agency's largest and starkest anti-smoking push, and its first national advertising effort. She was the only one of two dozen people appearing in the campaign to be featured in both rounds of ads. The CDC spent more than $100 million for the two rounds of ads on TV and in magazines and in other media, first in early 2012 and then again this year. The campaign was a bid to try to push adult smoking rates down again after they had appeared to level off for several years. CDC officials say it worked. They believe the campaign last year led at least 1.6 million Americans to try to quit smoking, and more than 100,000 to succeed, according to agency estimates published last week in the medical journal Lancet. Hero: 'She was a public health hero,' said Dr Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which conducted the campaign . Before: The ad showed pictured of a young Hall, before she got cancer . In an ad for this year's version of the campaign, Hall addressed the camera in the buzzing sound of her electrolarynx. She advised smokers to make a video of themselves now, in which they read a children's book or sing a lullaby. 'I wish I had. The only voice my grandson's ever heard is this one,' her electric voice growled. Hall's cancer was caused by the cigarette smoking she began in high school, CDC officials said. This summer the cancer spread to her brain, and radiation and surgery failed to save her. Frieden has said the agency will continue the campaign, and Hall was filmed this past weekend in the hospital, during her final days. CDC officials said they have not decided whether the most recent footage would be used in future spots.","Terrie Hall died Monday of cancer at a hospital in Winston-Salem, North Carolina .

Proven: The Advertising Standards Authority has dismissed complaints that Fairy adverts are 'misleading' as the company can prove its washing up liquid lasts twice as long as other brands . Fairy Liquid really does last twice as long as rival brands, the advertising watchdog ruled today. For more than 60 years, TV viewers have been told that Fairy Liquid lasts twice as long as other washing up liquids, accompanied by the jingle 'Now hands that do dishes can feel soft as your face, with mild green Fairy Liquid'. Although challenges have come and gone, it was not until today that the claim - made since Fairy first hit our shelves in 1950 - was 'proven'. Amazingly, it was a complaint from rivals Persil which backfired after bosses complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that the claim in the Fairy advert that it lasted 'twice as long' was misleading and could not be substantiated. The ASA investigated TV and digital billboard adverts, which showed one bottle of Fairy against two bottles of an 'unknown' rival. As the advert continues the bottles start emptying, with the one bottle of Fairy lasting as long as two bottles of the rival brand. A voiceover states: 'Generations have trusted Fairy's cleaning power because it lasts a long, long time. And today it lasts twice as long as the next best-selling brand. That's Fairyconomy.' Bosses at Persil complained to the ASA and challenged claims that Fairy lasted twice as long as the 'next best-selling brand'. Persil also challenged whether the ads made a 'fair comparison' and that the adverts were misleading as they neglected to mention critical information, such as the concentration and size of the bottles. The ASA, however, cleared the advert, saying it was not misleading as Fairy - owned by Procter & Gamble - could prove its claims. Scroll down for video . Remembered: Nanette Newman was the star of Fairy's washing up liquid adverts on TV in the Eighties . It also stated that the size of the . Fairy 433ml bottle on show - which in a 2012 review by Which? magazine . was found to wash the equivalent of 4,292 plates - was actually smaller . than the two 500ml rival brands on show. The advertising watchdog stated: 'The ASA noted the ads showed images of the advertised product beside an equals sign and two unbranded bottles of washing-up liquid. 'The ads also made clear that Fairy lasted twice as long as the next best-selling brand and that the next best-selling brand was based on AC Nielsen volume share data, which we understood identified that brand as Persil. 'We considered consumers would understand from the shape and comparative size of the bottles that the images were of the 433ml Fairy bottles and two 500ml Persil bottles. Celebrity endorsement: Jodie Kidd was unveiled the face of a Fairy Liquid campaign in 2006. She was photographed in her sister Jemma Kidd's home by model Helena Christensen . Promotion: TV chef Ainsley Harriot has also appeared in adverts for Fairy Liquid. Here, he is pictured in 2002 . 'In that context, we considered consumers would interpret the ads to mean that a standard 433ml bottle of Fairy lasted as long as two standard 500ml bottles of Persil when used in conditions representative of everyday use. 'The expert considered the test reflected the practices of consumers and demonstrated that Fairy lasted at least twice as long as Persil' Advertising Standards Authority . 'We sought expert advice on the robustness of the evidence provided by Procter & Gamble. 'The expert considered the test reflected the practices of consumers and demonstrated that Fairy lasted at least twice as long as Persil. 'On that basis, we considered the claims that Fairy lasted twice as long as the next best-selling brand had been substantiated.' The ASA added: 'The ads also made clear . that the next best-selling brand was based on AC Nielsen volume share . data, which we understood identified that brand as Persil. Famous: Actress Leslie Ash (left) first appeared on TV in 1964 aged four in this Fairy Liquid advertisement . Cleared: The Advertising Standards Authority found Fairy was not in breach of guidelines as its adverts 'objectively compared a material, relevant and representative feature of those products' 'Because the ads focused on the mileage of the products, we considered consumers would understand that the comparison was between the longevity of the Fairy product and that of the Persil product. Last month the ASA ruled Boeing did not mislead readers of trade magazine Flight International when promoting the advantages of its 747-8 jet over the A380 model of rival Airbus, which had complained to the watchdog. Boeing said its model has a '26 per cent cost advantage' per trip - and is '8 per cent more efficient' in kerosene consumption per seat. Also in August 2013, Sainsbury's said it would appeal an ASA decision to dismiss its complaint on Tesco's Price Promise comparison scheme. Sainsbury's said Tesco's initiative was unfair for comparing own-label products, but the ASA stated the basis of Tesco's scheme was 'clear'. 'Furthermore, we considered the images made clear that a standard 433ml bottle of Fairy lasted as long as two standard 500ml bottles of Persil. 'In comparing the mileage of the products, we considered the ads objectively compared a material, relevant, verifiable and representative feature of those products. 'We considered information about the concentration of the liquid and the size and price of the bottle was not material information in relation to ads that made clear that the basis of the comparison was the mileage of the products. 'Because the ads objectively compared a material, relevant, verifiable and representative feature of those products and because they did not omit material information in respect of the mileage comparison, we concluded the ads were not in beach.' Bosses at Procter & Gamble - which make Fairy - said it had used the Build Up Suds (BUS) test on the 'mileage' of Fairy and Persil, which showed it lasted twice as long and was 'two times better value than Persil.'","Persil complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about Fairy's ads .

The judges boasted that it is the ‘most diverse’ list of novels ever nominated for the Man Booker Prize. But readers would be forgiven for thinking it was the most obscure, after mostly unknown authors made the nominations for the literary prize. Among those on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize for Fiction are the works of three first-time authors and an E-book that was initially given away for free in return for mentions on Twitter. Overlooked: Major authors who are off the list include Margaret Atwood, pictured left with an earlier book The Blind Assassin, and Roddy Doyle who won the Booker Prize in 1993 with Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha . The list of 13 books in contention for the £50,000 prize represents a departure from last year when Hilary Mantel became the first British person to win the award for a second time. This year’s longlist is notable for the number of big-name authors who have been overlooked, including JM Coetzee, Roddy Doyle and Margaret Atwood. Five of the books have yet to be published. Writer Robert Macfarlane, who chaired the judging panel, said: ‘This is surely the most diverse longlist in Man Booker history: wonderfully various in terms of geography, form, length and subject. ‘These 13 outstanding novels range from the traditional to the experimental, from the first century AD to the present day, from 100 pages to 1,000 and from Shanghai to Hendon.’ Last year's winner: Hilary Mantel for her novel Bring Up The Bodies. Pictured here at the ceremony at London's Guildhall, she has won the prize twice . Asked if there was a shared theme for the nominees, Mr Macfarlane said that they mostly seemed to be based on disasters. The 1,000-page work listed is The Kills by Richard House, a political thriller that was first published digitally in four parts, each with a series of short films and audio clips that add to the story. The first volume, called Sutler, was made available free of charge to any reader who sent a message about it on Facebook or Twitter. Mr House, an academic at the University of Birmingham, said the novel can be ‘read and enjoyed alone’ but included suggestions in his book for when readers should access the extra material. Mr Macfarlane said all the judges had seen ‘the additional content to some extent’ and would take it into account when drawing up a shortlist but added that it was ‘by no means an advantage’ over the other more traditionally-published books. He said: ‘The novel has always adapted and it’s a very fast-changing form and that’s one reason why it’s survived to the present. It shifts and changes and this is more shifting and changing than most.’ Two authors have been nominated before: Jim Crace, who's up this year for Harvest, and Colm Toibin for The Testament of Mary . Only two authors on the list have been nominated for the prize before. Jim Crace is listed for Harvest, which is expected to be his final novel, 16 years after he was shortlisted for Quarantine. Colm Tóibín, who has been shortlisted twice before, is in the running for The Testament of Mary, which came out last year. The three first-time authors on the list are NoViolet Bulawayo, who was born in Zimbabwe a year after independence, Eve Harris, whose yet-to-be-released book is set in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in Hendon, London, and Donal Ryan, whose book is told from points of view of 21 people struggling to make a living in rural Ireland. The Booker Prize, set up in 1969, is awarded each year to the best full-length English language novel. A shortlist of six books will be announced in September with the winner named at a ceremony at the Guildhall in London on Tuesday, October 15. The panel of five judges includes Martha Kearney, presenter of The World At One on BBC Radio 4 and The Review Show on BBC Two. The bookies have installed Crace as the 9/2 favourite, according to Ladbrokes, but there is a far tighter range of odds quoted than normal. Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes said: ‘The longlist this year was one of the hardest of all time to create odds for. At this stage we’re just favouring Crace but we don’t want to write off any contender too hastily. ‘The odds suggest the judges will be up long into the night to form the shortlist, let alone arrive at a winner.’ A spokesman for bookseller Waterstones said it was ‘a thrilling list’. He said: ‘The sheer scope and variety contained in this list mean this should be one of the most unpredictable Man Booker prizes for years.’","Longlist is notable for big-name authors who have been overlooked .

The legendary deep-fried Mars bar has become the symbol of everything that is wrong with the artery-clogging Scottish diet. But now an unlikely cross-Border skirmish has broken out after a London firm applied to patent the fat and sugar-laden ‘delicacy’. Crispy Candy, based in Camden Market, claims its technique produces a tastier and healthier deep-fried Mars bar than the Scottish version. Calorific copy: Crispy Candy at London's Camden Market are attempting to patent their version of the classic Scottish battered and deep-fried Mars bar . It involves chilling the chocolate bars before frying them in batter made from buttermilk imported from the US. Now the firm’s owner, Garry Davis, has lodged an application with the patent  office in London which, if approved, would stop anyone else copying his technique. But the Scottish chip shop that claims to have given the world the deep-fried Mars bar has accused Mr Davis of ‘piggy backing’ on its calorie-laden creation. Mars-vellous: Garry Davis wants to patent his deep-fried Mars bar technique . Mr Davis, 33, charges Londoners £3 for his deep-fried bar – The Mars Meltdown – compared with the £1.50 typically charged north of the Border. He said: ‘It took us about six months to develop the perfect way of frying chocolate bars. 'We’ve taken the deep-fried Mars bar and changed it into something more of an indulgent dessert. ‘It’s all about storing them at the correct temperature and using a different kind of batter – which means that you’re left with a lovely, fluffy, gooey mouthful instead of an oil-filled crispy bar that many chip shops serve.’ The Intellectual Property Office – formerly known as the Patent Office – is now considering application b1218841.3 from Mr Davis, which concerns a ‘cooking method’. He said: ‘I want to protect our scientific way of making the treat instead of the actual bar itself. We’re proud of our technique.’ The Carron Fish Bar in Stonehaven, Kincardineshire, is first credited with dipping Mars bars in batter and plunging them in to the fat fryer. Last year it ended up in a row with Mars, which complained it had not ‘authorised’ the use of its product. Owner Lorraine Watson said: ‘We have been serving deep-fried Mars bars for more than 20 years now. Mr Davis obviously heard about our issue with Mars last year and is trying to piggyback on it. You're bar-ed: A patent would mean that Crispy Candy's Mars bar, which are chilled before they are dipped in a special batter made from American buttermillk, would be protected . She added: ‘No matter what happens, the deep-fried Mars bar was born here in Scotland. It is, and always will be, Scottish. ‘The way we do it works and it will continue to be popular with everyone who visits for years to come.’ However, top Scots pastry  chef Mark Greenaway said the English could keep it as far as he was concerned. Mr Greenaway, who runs a restaurant in Edinburgh and represented Scotland on BBC series The Great British Menu, said: ‘If this guy from London wants to claim the deep-fried Mars bar, then he is more than welcome to it. ‘The sooner Scotland gets rid of this image of the deep-fried Mars bar as the national dish, the better. ‘We have so many other better Scottish delicacies to celebrate. The whole idea of deep-fried  chocolate is just strange.’","London confectioner wants to patent the deep-fried Mars bar .

The Tokyo Game Show this year has two big stars, Sony's PlayStation 4 and the Microsoft Xbox One. But with huge numbers of young, barely dressed models also in attendance, game fans may well find their gaze drawn elsewhere. Asia's largest video game expo kicked off today at Makuhari Messe Convention Center in Chiba, east of Tokyo, with a record number of games developers taking part. And judging by these pictures, they have brought with them record numbers of scantily-clad young women, leading to scenes reminiscent of a Seventies-era car show. Scroll down for video . Who cares about video games? Models pose for photos as they promote smartphone games at the Tokyo Game Show in Chiba, suburban Tokyo . Like a Seventies car show... The game show kicked off with a record high number of exhibitors consisting of 352 companies and organisations from 33 different countries . Many of the models are dressed as characters from the games - complete with colourful wigs, skimpy outfits and oversized, futuristic weaponry. Others were provocatively styled as cro- top-wearing, cleavage-baring schoolgirls, complete with the knee socks and tartan skirts more typically associated with Japanese school uniforms. The contrast with the show's visitors - mostly conservatively dressed men - offers an apt reminder of why the computer entertainment industry is under attack for its representation of women. But such debates were quite clearly off the cards at today's event, where most attention was directed at the eagerly awaited new offerings from Sony and Microsoft. In a reversal of the old order, both the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One are to go on sale first in the U.S. and Europe in November, far ahead of expected Japanese release dates slated for next year. Sony and Microsoft both say tailoring the machines for the Japanese market takes more time but many in the gaming world see the delay as symbolic of Japan's loss of its pioneering and leading role in the industry. Fancy dress: A model poses, left, dressed as a character from the game Soris. The pair on the right are dressed as characters from Sega's Phantasy Star game . Geeks' fantasy: Two models brandish models of oversized video game-style weapons at a stand at the show . Not in the least bit distracted: A visitor plays video games on tablet cushion called Goron, while Goron's campaign model plays in front of him dressed in a leather playsuit . With eyes on a comeback, this year's show has a renewed focus this year on independent game software developers. Game insiders and experts say that encouraging a new breed of game creators is crucial for Japan to regain its status in the game world, ceded over the years to the U.S. and Europe where startups face fewer obstacles. It's felt that the broader stagnation witnessed in the Japanese economy also infected the game world, where big success was followed by complacency, and even a stifling of newcomers. A presentation by Sony executives today signalled this fresh attempt to woo independent developers. Flashed on a giant screen was the slogan made up of the words 'PS,' which stands for PlayStation, and 'indies,' with a big red heart mark in the middle. 'We are welcoming the contributions of independent developers,' said Masayasu Ito, senior vice president at Sony Computer Entertainment, the Tokyo-based electronics and entertainment giant's game division. Save me! A campaign model poses in the clutches of a sculpture of a robot character from an Xbox game at Microsoft's stand, which is one of the biggest at the show . The Microsoft Xbox One is displayed on a screen: Along with Sony's PlayStation 4, the latest Xbox is one of the stars of the show, which is the biggest of its kind in Asia . Star game producer Keiji Inafune believes Japan must first recognise its failure before it can move on, as most have become too comfortable and set in their ways, resting on the laurels of past success. Still worse, they have grown cautious, and churn out sequels of the old formulas, instead of taking risks, he said. 'Suddenly, Japanese games weren't selling, and they didn't look as good as they used to look, compared to foreign games,' he told The Associated Press. 'We need to first confront our own defeat, and we need to start learning from the world.' Previously a star creative at Capcom, where over a sparkling three-decade career he was behind such hits as Mega Man and Dead Rising, Mr Inafune started his own game company Comcept three years ago. He says he is determined to show Japan is ready to reinvent itself. 'Japan is going to rise again to the top,' he said at his Comcept office in Tokyo. 'We have to go back to our roots and rediscover what made Japan great.'

Visitors play Wolfenstein: The New Order video game for Sony's PlayStation 4: The PS4 goes on sale in Japan in late February - three months after its release in the West . Both Sony and Microsoft insist the delay in the Japanese launch of their machines is to give more time for preparation. The PlayStation 4, which goes on sale on November 15 in the U.S. and Canada, and on November 29 in Europe, goes on sale in Japan on February 22, 2014 - the first time a major Sony console is not going on sale first in Japan. Microsoft Xbox One also isn't set to go on sale in Japan until next year although its global launch is set for November 22. No date for the Japan sale is being announced. Phil Spencer, corporate vice president at Microsoft Game Studios, says tailoring Xbox One for the Japanese market is taking more time, such as making sure the voice recognition feature works and signing on partnerships for local content. But he denied the importance of Japan was diminishing for Microsoft, and stressed more software titles were in the works for Xbox One, including 'D4' from star developer Hidetaka Suehiro. Instead, he said the changes were more about a growing diversity in types of games because they were being played on smartphones and tablets, as well as consoles. 'The creative capability here is without match,' said Mr Spencer.","Asia's largest video game show kicked off in Japan today .

A man has been charged with child abuse and cruelty after he whipped a girl to the beat of Robin Thicke's controversial 'Blurred Lines' song while filming it on his phone. Steven Fillingim, 40, of Pensacola, is accused of repeatedly physically abusing an underage female. A charge sheet shows that the victim claims Fillingim returned home on Saturday night and branded her lazy for not vacuuming and deliberately missing school earlier in the week. He allegedly hit her face with a belt and his hands. According to an arrest report, he forced his victim to hold a 20-pound weight in front of her body, and then hold an 8-pound weight behind her body, Miami New Times reported. He allegedly then forced her to dig mud for 90 minutes before eventually allowing her to stop and go to bed at 1.30 am. The victim told police that on the day she missed school Fillingim had punished her by using a 2.5ft long switch to whip her thighs, North Escambia reported. The accused allegedly hit her in time with Robin Thicke's 'Blurred Lines' song, which has been condemned as trivialising rape and promoting an unhealthy attitude towards sexual consent. The 40-year-old allegedly whipped a girl to the beat of Robin Thicke's song, which has been widely condemned . Fillingim allegedly began to record the incident on his phone, before sending the video to his girlfriend in a text message, entitling it 'She's Home', Huffington Post reported. The woman showed it to police and Fillingim was arrested and charged with three counts of cruelty to a child and child abuse without great bodily harm. Robin Thicke's worldwide hit has been widely panned, with some critics claiming it refers to non-consensual sex in some of the song’s lyrics. The main chorus from the song includes the lines: ‘I hate these blurred lines’, ‘I know you want it’ and ‘must get nasty’.

At its peek, 4,000 'Harlem Shake' videos were being uploaded onto YouTube every day. The viral success helped push download sales of the song, which charted at number one for five consecutive weeks on the US Billboard Hot 100. It also reached number three in the United Kingdom and number one in both Australia and New Zealand. But now Baauer – real name Harry Rodrigues – has spoken out about the downside of having such an unexpected smash. The 24-year-old DJ and producer created the track in his bedroom and since he wasn’t planning for such a runaway success he didn’t seek clearance from the two artists who he sampled without permission.

Even though the track had been around since May 2012, it was only after it had gained global success, that Baauer and his record label - Mad Decent - received lawyer's letters on behalf of the sampled artists - reggaetón artist Hector Delgado and Philadelphia rapper Jayson Musson. Now despite record label boss Diplo having previously said that an agreement had been reached to clear the samples, Baauer has said he is still waiting to be paid. ‘I’m meeting with my lawyer tomorrow for lunch, so I’m gonna find that out (why he hasn't been paid). I think it’s mostly because of all the legal s**t,' he told Pitchfork. 'I didn’t clear the samples because I was in my f***ing bedroom on Grand Street. I wasn't going to think to call up [Delgado], I didn’t even know who it was who did that [sample]; I knew the Jayson Musson [sample]. So I found myself in that f***ing pickle. Legal letters and s**t. 'Ugh. Lawyers. So exposure-wise it was fantastic, but everything else...,’ he told them.

Row: Newham mayor Sir Robin Wales has been accused of trying to 'suppress diversity' in the London borough . A Labour mayor is under fire after banning foreign newspapers from libraries and cutting translation services to encourage immigrants to speak English. Sir Robin Wales claimed he was trying to prevent ‘apartheid’ in the London borough of Newham. He has invested public money in English lessons and refused to fund events which are only aimed at one section of the community. The Tories accused Sir Robin of trying to suppress diversity in one of the country’s most diverse areas. Critics also claim the cuts are designed to attract more white working class people into the area. Around 139,000 of Newham’s residents were born in England, while 130,000 were born outside of the European Union. Sir Robin told the BBC Asian Network programme: ‘I’m very strongly of the view that if you try and segregate people into different groups and try to keep them separate, that’s not only bad for everybody [else], it’s bad for the particular community you do it to. ‘Apartheid was wrong in South Africa, it would be wrong here.’ He went on: ‘Far from suppressing diversity, we respect and champion it. We are the most ethnically diverse borough in Europe and the evidence proves our approach of bringing our residents together is the right one. ‘Almost 90 per cent of our residents say this is a place where people from different backgrounds get on well together. We bring people together in a large number of ways including a range of annual free community events - attended by almost 100,000 this year. ‘It is absurd of anyone to say I dislike Newham. I love the borough, I have lived here for 35 years and I am proud to call it my home. We are building on everything that is great about Newham to make it a better place for everyone who lives, works and visits here.’ The council has begun giving £250 grants to street parties involving all but declining to support ‘single community’ events. In the last year it has also rejected an application for a 'super mosque' in the borough. Controversy: Newham council rejected plans for a so-called mega mosque in the borough . Andrew Boff, Leader of the Conservative group on the Greater London Assembly, said: ‘I don’t think [Sir Robin] actually likes Newham. I think he wants to change it to some other borough. I think he’s a bit ashamed. ‘Integration is either respecting diversity or trying to suppress it and I think there’s more suppressing going on. ‘What’s happening in Newham is a big backwards step.’","Labour's Sir Robin Wales ordered cuts to language services to increase English speaking .

A school is using a minibus to shuttle its 460 pupils a few hundred feet to their canteen each day - to save them crossing a busy road.

Danger: Teachers claim the lights on a nearby pelican crossing in Slough, Berks, do not stay red for long enough for an entire class to cross . They would like the local council to install a zebra crossing at an estimated cost of £40,000 or provide a lollipop person. But in the meantime, the school says using the minibus is the 'safest and quickest' way to move pupils between the two sites. The Harrow pub was refurbished by the school earlier this year so their existing hall could be freed up for lunchtime activities. It has since been renamed Harrow Hall. Dr Patricia Sutlieff, chairman of trustees and governors, said: 'Our priority is safety. 'This is the safest and quickest way of getting them to Harrow Hall, and it is working very well at the moment.' Dr Sutlieff said some of the children had timed the journey and it takes 'about a minute to a minute-and-a-half'.

Slough Borough Council suggested a longer alternative walking route but the school was concerned about the time and safety.

A lot depends on the council’s final decision about the roads near us. 'The situation will be kept under review. However, we could continue the current system indefinitely.' A council spokeswoman said it is doing its best to ensure safety in the area.

Owner James Smith has been banned from keeping horses for a year after RSPCA inspectors found Bertie the pony in extreme pain, with blood pouring from his eye. Mr Smith, of Cottingham, East Yorkshire, had cruelly tied Bertie in such a way that the pony had wrapped the chain around the tree several times, limiting his movement and resulting in him injuring his eye. Painful neglect: Bertie the pony was found in great pain and distress by RSPCA inspectors after he had impaled himself on the tree to which he was tied in an attempt to move . After he was freed by RSPCA and police officers, a veterinarian found that Bertie's eye had been ruptured would need to be removed. Inspector Hannah Bryer said: ‘Bertie suffered immense pain and distress as a result of the way he was tethered. ‘The fact of the matter is, had he been tethered in a correct and safe fashion, this injury would not have occurred. Access de-neighed: Bertie's owner has been banned from handling horses for a year . ‘The pony had an injury to the right eye, which was bleeding. 'The pony was at full stretch in attempt to get away from the tree, with the neck strap tight to his head.

She said: ‘The current animal welfare legislation does not make tethering horses illegal. However, people who chose to tether their animals must ensure that it is done safely and appropriately. ‘The consequences of not heeding that advice can be devastating, as this case highlights. ‘Thankfully, Bertie has adapted well to only having one eye and is doing well in his new home.’ Smith pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to the pony at Beverley Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday. He was banned from keeping horses and ordered to undertake 30 hours at a Humberside probation attendance centre.","Bertie the pony impaled himself onto a tree branch and lost his eye .

Over the past two years 357 children in the UK were urged to carry out sexual acts live over the internet . Children as young as eight are being targeted online by foreign paedophile gangs who believe that Britain’s ‘liberal’ values make them easy prey. Britain has become the top target for cyber sexual predators, a report reveals today. The criminals trick victims into thinking they are talking to a boy or girl the same age. They then persuade them to send compromising pictures or perform ‘slave-like sex acts’ live on webcams – before threatening to show the pictures to their families or friends or post them on the internet. Investigators believe youngsters in this country are being exploited more than in any other nation due to offenders’ perceptions that British teenagers are more promiscuous. The gangs also believe British parents impose fewer boundaries due to our ‘free, open and liberal society’, the report says. Over the past two years 357 children in the UK were urged to carry out sexual acts live over the internet after being duped by criminal gangs posing as youngsters the same age as them. This represents almost half of the 716 known victims worldwide, according to the figures published by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre. Of those, 184 in the UK were blackmailed over a long period and forced to carry out ever more sickening sexual acts by the offenders who threatened to share obscene images of the victim with their friends and family unless victims complied with their demands. Britain is now the top destination for cyber sex predators due to liberal parenting and perceptions of promiscuous children . In some cases, teenagers were forced to hand over money or even cut themselves live on web cams to satisfy their attacker’s demands. The abuse led to a number of children self harming and seven committing suicide, one of whom was British. Daniel Perry, 17, killed himself earlier this year after being blackmailed over embarrassing images he posted online. He thought he was talking to a pretty girl his own age from Illinois in the US. But the apprentice mechanic had been targeted by a gang who tried to blackmail him by securing compromising images following months of flirting via Skype. The gang revealed themselves in a menacing call via Skype. They threatened to show the images to his family unless he paid over some cash. When Daniel asked: ‘What can I do to stop you showing this to my family?’ they said he would be ‘better off dead’ if he failed to pay. He replied simply ‘Bye’ and less than an hour later jumped off the Forth Road Bridge in Scotland. He died in hospital on July 15. His mother Nicola, from Dunfermline, Fife, said: ‘They are clever people and he was just scared and didn’t know what to do. 'Parents need to tell their children that nothing is that bad that it is worth taking your life over.’ Daniel Perry, 17, from Dunfermline in Fife, leapt to his death from the Forth Road Bridge in Scotland in July this year less than an hour after a gang told him he would be ‘better off dead’ if he did not follow their orders. Another seven victims seriously self-harmed, of whom six were from the UK, CEOP said. Experts said the paedophiles saw Britain as an easy target. Stephanie McCourt of CEOP said: ‘First of all it’s the English language. ‘They are able to threaten the children if they can communicate with them. English is a really popular universal language. ‘Second, the offenders have actually said that because they perceive the UK as a very free and liberal society, they think that they will have more success in targeting UK children.’ Investigators have warned that abusers’ methods are becoming more sophisticated with many researching the homes and schools of their targets using tools such as Google Maps. They also glean information on friends and family from social networking sites before creating fake online personas. Their victims, some as young as eight, are initially targeted on open chat sites and social networks before being directed to more private web sites. In one case, an offender collated images of his victims in a folder named ‘slaves’. CEOP has been involved in 12 blackmail investigations in the past two years, and in each case arrests were made less than a week after receiving a report of abuse. The abusers came from four different continents, and in five cases the criminals were based in the UK. The biggest case, code-named Operation K, involved 322 children who were blackmailed around the world, including 96 in the UK. They were targeted by a gang from a non-European country who are due to stand trial in the coming weeks. Clinical psychologist Elly Farmer said: ‘We are seeing pure sadism and desire for power and control.’ CEOP chief executive Peter Davies urged parents to talk to their children about their online lives. He said: ‘You might ask your son or daughter where they’re going at the weekend, why not do the same about what they are up to on their computer or mobile phone?’ Scotland Yard has seen an explosion in cases of online bullying and ‘Twitter trolling’. The number of offences reported to the Met leapt by 1,500 compared to last year, Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey said. Dr Miranda Hovarth has found that exposure to pornography makes teenage boys more likely to view women as objects, engage in risky behaviour, and have sex earlier . 'I . was about 12 and this person started talking to me on the internet and . said he was around my age. 'He'd . steer the conversation in a way where it was turning a bit dirty, then . he'd start asking for other types of pictures as well. If you try and . say ""oh I don't want to talk about that' or 'whatever"", he'd threaten or . blackmail me, saying that he'd send my dad all the chat logs if I . didn't do what he said. I just thought you wouldn't blackmail someone . you're supposed to be in love with so I just told him to shut up and . sent him a couple more photos but he started to do that every week. 'My . teacher said I'd been acting depressed and they sorted me out with . counselling. I'd started to self harm as well because everything just . came together at the same time, and I was really upset and just needed a . release. 'Luckily I'm a . fairly strong person and I can get over things - I've learned to just . push them away. But what if it was someone who wasn't, who was a . weaker-minded person than me, what would have happened? They might have . committed suicide or something, and it wouldn't have even been their . fault - it would be because people weren't there for them.' Teenage girls will welcome David Cameron’s plans for online porn filters because they are sick of seeing it, according to an expert who has studied the effect of web porn on young people. Dr Miranda Horvath, a psychologist at Middlesex University, said many girls were exposed to explicit content against their will on social networking sites. She suggested the Government could go further, perhaps bringing in the German system under which adults can only access online porn by signing a form at their post office. This would ensure children would be protected from hardcore images, while over-18s. Dr Horvath said blocking unsuitable content could change the ‘sexualised wallpaper’ of young people’s lives. She was the lead author of a report for the Children’s Commissioner earlier this year, which assessed 30 years of research. It found that porn can lead to boys viewing girls as sex objects, indulging in risky sexual behaviour and having sex earlier. Mr Cameron has promised that all homes will be asked to decide whether they wanted to impose a filter, with ‘yes’ as the default option. Dr Horvath said that although it might not be possible to ‘stamp it out completely’ but we should ‘provide people with the option’.","357 children were asked to perform a sex act online in the last two years .

The expertly trained staff at Heron's bonsai nursery prune the delicate . trees on a daily basis to make sure they retain their beautiful form. Gardeners at the Lingfield centre tend to the incredible seven and a half acre landscape which is filled by large and small trees, all grown in the bonsai style. While around half of the trees are planted and cultivated in the UK, others are imported from Japan before being placed among ponds, pathways and benches for visitors to marvel at. Miniature: Bonsai trees are measured in 'hands', but the idea that they are all tiny is false. Some can grow up to two metres tall . Accolade: The Heron bonsai nursery was the first ever to produce a gold winning bonsai garden at the RHS Chelsea flower show . Scenery: As well as its award winning collection of bonsais, the vast nursery boasts a Japanese garden with a coi carp pond . Peter Chan and his wife Dawn began collecting miniature trees in 1986 and have since turned the site into a fully landscaped haven for bonsai fans. Peter became interested in bonsai in 1967 when he started to grow trees and shrubs in a tiny London flat. He won the first ever RHS Gold Medal for a bonsai garden in 1982, the first time he exhibited his intricate work. He said: 'Our reputation for high quality trees has always attracted immense interest, especially from powerful people who want calming influence in their lives. 'Many of our trees have been used for film shoots and advertising work.' Growing name: The Heron nursery is revered among horticulturalists in Britain.

Green shoots: Nursery owner Peter became interested in bonsai in the 60's when he grew his first tree in his flat in London. Haven: Peter and his wife Dawn have turned their seven acre site in Lingfield into a fully landscaped haven for bonsai fans . Bonsai is the reproduction of natural tree forms in miniature. It has been practiced in Japan and China since 706 AD.                Bonsai can be practised with almost any woody-stemmed tree or shrub species that produces branches strong enough to be cultivated and will remain small through pot confinement and pruning. Although they are miniature replicas, Bonsai trees should not be kept indoors at all times. Like normal growing plants, they need light and moisture. If cultivated correctly, Bonsai can last for hundreds of years. Despite the miniature trees' autumnal colours, it seems the weather is set to warm up for the last day of summer tomorrow. The Met Office has predicted a hot weekend ahead, with temperatures expected to soar to 23C in some parts of Britain. The mini heatwave, which could see temperatures reach 25C by Monday, is likely to be welcomed by millions of families across the country, who have been arguing about whether they should turn their central heating on even . though it is only mid-September.

Smoking is set to be banned in all prisons in England and Wales, sparking fears inmates may riot when they are stopped from lighting up, it emerged last night. As of next year, prisoners will be unable to smoke in all parts of the jails – including exercise yards. They are expected to be offered nicotine patches to help satisfy their cravings. A pilot project will begin next spring, before being introduced in other prisons during a 12-month period. New ban: A smoking ban is set to be introduced in prisons across the country after staff complained they were being forced to breathe in the second-hand smoke of inmates . Those in the South West, including Exeter and Eastwood Park Women’s Prison, will pilot the ban on all tobacco products. The Prison Service confirmed they were considering banning smoking ‘across the prison estate and as part of this are looking at possible sites as early adopters’. Figures show about 80 per cent of the 84,300 inmates smoke and tobacco is a valuable currency that is traded on the wings. Some jails already ban the habit for bad behaviour but the uniform ban is likely to anger those ‘well-behaved’ inmates who look forward to their cigarette breaks out in the yard to help them through the boredom of their sentences. The rule change comes after a campaign by staff, who have long objected to breathing in the second-hand smoke of inmates. It also comes amid fears that the Prison Service could face compensation claims from officers who claim that they are victims of passive smoking. The 2007 smoking ban designed to protect people from the effects of second-hand smoke in public places did not apply to prison cells. Senior prison staff were said to have been informed of the move in a letter this month. Pilot: Exeter Prison is one of the prisons in the South West to be taking part in a smoking ban pilot . ‘You will no doubt be aware that the decision has been made that the time is right for the prison estate to adopt a tobacco and smoke-free policy to provide a smoke-free workplace/environment for our staff and prisoners,’ it reportedly said in the Times. The letter said that as a first step a number of establishments in the South West ‘will become early adopters of the scheme’. They would implement a complete ban on all tobacco products in late March or early April next year. Steve Gillan, general secretary of the Prison Officers' Association, welcomed the smoking ban but told The Times its implementation would be difficult. He said: 'There is no pretending otherwise. It could cause disturbances but they have done it successfully in Canada and in young offender institutions in England and Wales.' He added: ‘We welcome this move. It is our policy to have smoke-free prisons for our members. We will work with the ministry to make sure it works effectively.’ One prison source said of the timetable for imposing the ban: ‘I am not sure it is the right time. 'Everything in jails is extremely stretched and more job losses are coming.’","A pilot project in prisons across the South West will begin next spring .

Illegal: Miss Liddle died after taking the banned substance gamma hydroxybutyrate to help her sleep . A teenage mother died after overdosing on a date rape drug that she took to help her sleep. Shaunie Liddle, 19, and her boyfriend had been advised to use small amounts of the illegal drug, but they kept taking more when they did not feel it was working quickly enough. Miss Liddle, the mother of a toddler, was found in her bed by police at her home in Dunster Close, Darlington, after they were alerted to the scene by two nursery staff who had visited the house for an appointment. Miss Liddle’s death on June 11 sparked huge speculation on social networks that she had been stabbed or murdered, forcing Durham Police to release a statement asking people not to post 'hurtful and upsetting' speculation and rumour. An inquest into her death, held at Crook Coroner’s Court, heard that Miss Liddle had taken gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB, alongside her boyfriend, who was not named in court. Det Sgt Paul Faulkner, who led the investigation into Miss Liddle’s death, said GHB is best known as a date rape drug and that after a fast initial high the user will quickly become drowsy and relaxed. DS Faulkner told coroner Andrew Tweddle that police did initially suspect foul play due to some unexplained marks on Miss Liddle’s body, but that was ruled out after the post-mortem examination. Miss Liddle’s partner was taken to hospital suffering the after effects of the drug but recovered. DS Faulkner added: 'In interview, the deceased’s partner said that he and Miss Liddle were very aware of the meeting with the nursery staff the next day and they wanted to get a good night’s sleep. 'They were described as having quite chaotic lives. He went to an associate and asked him for something that would that would help them sleep and was given a bottle of GHB.

Four semi-professional English football players accused of taking part in a match-fixing scandal are so terrified that the ring-leader will send round 'friends to visit them' they are barricading their doors. The quartet have appeared in court today in Australia accused of taking part in a £1.2 million match-fixing plot. It is alleged the men were involved in a scam to fix the results of games they played in for Southern Stars Football Club in Melbourne, as part of a criminal syndicate with links to Europe and Asia. The accused players are Reiss Noel (pictured left) Joe Woolley (right), Nick McKoy and David Obaze, who were allegedly part of a ring whose winnings are said to have totalled more than £1.2million . Former AFC Hornchurch players Joe Woolley (L) and Reiss Noel each face eight charges - four counts of engaging in, and four counts of facilitating, conduct that corrupts a betting outcome . Goalkeeper Joe Woolley, defenders Reiss Noel and David Obaze and midfielder Nick McKoy, who all recently played for teams in English non-leagues, each face eight charges - four counts of engaging in, and four counts of facilitating, conduct that corrupts a betting outcome. Woolley, 23, and Noel, 24, were with AFC Hornchurch in the Isthmian League before moving to Southern Stars in July. Obaze, 23, has played for a number of non-league clubs in England, most recently last season he was at Bishop's Stortford. McKoy, 27, was also previously in English non-league football with several clubs including Tamworth and AFC Hornchurch. Zia Younan, 36, the coach of Southern Stars, who is an Australian citizen originally from the Czech Republic, faces 10 charges relating to five matches. Nick McKoy, left, and David Obaze, right, are terrified of the 'ringleader' in the scam they are accused of . Appearing today at Melbourne Magistrates Court, all five were granted bail on condition they report to police three times a week and do not attend any FIFA-sanctioned football matches. Deputy Chief Magistrate Jelena Popovic ordered them to appear in court again on December 6. Today the court heard the players have been barricading their doors at night because they are scared of the alleged ringleader, who is in custody. Detective Acting Senior Sergeant Scott Poynder said two of the four Southern Stars players jammed chairs against their hotel room door for fear Segaran 'Gerry' Gsubramaniam, 45, would get people to 'come visit them'. Mr Gsubramaniam allegedly passed on information from associates in Hungary and Malaysia - including a known international criminal fixer of sporting matches - to members of Southern Stars in exchange for cash, accommodation and rental cars. The court was told the continuing investigation may potentially involve other Victorian clubs, as well in clubs in Queensland and overseas. Mr Poynder said transaction records seized from Mr Gsubramaniam's home in the Oakleigh South district of Melbourne including ripped-up documents that were pieced together - indicated he had received around $230,000 (Australian dollars) from international accounts since July. The Malaysian national is accused of fixing five Victorian Premier League matches involving the Southern Stars between July and September this year. Mr Poynder said the accused sportsmen were professional players from the UK, playing in the amateur league during the European 'off-season', and were willing to give evidence against Mr Gsubramaniam, whom they claim was 'the main man'. The court heard Mr Gsubramaniam made some admissions to police, but claimed he was 'a small fry' in the scam. Mr Gsubramaniam was charged with five counts of engaging in, and five counts of facilitating, conduct that corrupts or would corrupt a betting outcome. Each offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment. Prosecutor Peter Rose opposed Mr Gsubramaniam's bail, alleging he may interfere with witnesses and was a flight risk because he had no ties to the country and potential access to large amounts of money. Mr Poynder said he had discussed obtaining passports under another name in secretly taped phone conversations. Defence lawyer Michael Gleeson said his client, who had no prior offences, should be bailed like his co-accused, most of whom were international citizens. Mr Gleeson said there could be extensive delays in the case being heard given the breadth of the investigation and the fact this case was the first prosecution under new legislation designed to protect integrity in sport in the state of Victoria. Mr Gsubramaniam's bail application will continue to be heard next Tuesday. After today's court hearing Victorian police said more arrests were likely in the investigation into an alleged international football match-fixing syndicate. Southern Stars have lost 16 games this season, drawn four games, but managed to beat the top side 1-0. They are bottom of their league.","Goalkeeper Joe Woolley, defenders Reiss Noel and David Obaze and midfielder Nick McKoy each face eight charges - four counts of engaging in, and four counts of facilitating, conduct that corrupts a betting outcome .

Victorian-style handwritten exams will be consigned to history within a decade, a leading schools chief predicts. Pen and paper tests will be scrapped and replaced with online questions which get gradually harder if students are not being challenged. David Hanson, chief executive of the Independent Association of Prep Schools, will use a speech next week to predict that by 2023 online testing will be the norm. History: Traditional pen and paper exams could disappear within a decade, according to private schools chief David Hanson . If exams are carried out using computers, it is likely that lessons in classrooms will also rely much less on pen, paper and textbooks. Some schools have already faced criticism for demanding parents buy expensive tablets for use in lessons. There are also concerns that pupils will not develop handwriting skills and become too reliant on technology, including spell checkers. But Mr Hanson will argue that the system of students completing paper-based exams which are then sent for marking during the summer is inefficient, expensive and out-dated. He will tell a conference of the IAPS next week: ‘By looking at the past and by tracking forward current trends, I predict that in 10 years’ time (2023) maths, English and science will still be core subjects but technology will have been completely embraced and will be used extensively by a generation of teachers who grew up with it. ‘Assessment will be by on-line adaptive tests.’ Future: With tests completed using computers, pupils will become more reliant on technology in lessons . In the adaptive tests computers analyse the answers children give and if they are finding some too easy will start presenting tougher questions to give them chance to achieve higher grades. It is argued the move to embrace technology will also prevent a repeat of the marking rows in which papers have to be re-graded. Ahead of the conference, Mr Hanson said: ‘We’re being forced to live with a system that we’ve had for more than a century, with children being sat down on a hot summer’s day and writing on an exam paper which is then dispatched to someone who spends their summer holiday marking it. ‘That’s not necessary. It’s expensive and it’s subject to all sorts of variables, not least human failure. That whole system is just out of step with technology and I think it’ll be consigned to history soon,’ he told the Telegraph. ‘Fundamentally, we all want an assessment and examinations system that we can believe in and it is clear confidence is being lost in the current system,’ he said. ‘It is no longer fit for purpose; it’s hugely expensive and results are unreliable because it’s too dependent on individuals sitting down and marking.’","By 2023 all exams will be completed using computers, David Hanson says .

Crowd-funding is now being used to generate funds to pay for funerals which can cost up to $10,000 for a standard ceremony. Traditionally the capital-generating method has been used by small businesses and entrepreneurs to raise funds for a specific project from numerous parties. Some businesses have sold small portions of their assets to multiple funders as an incentive for investors to get involved. There are now several crowd-funding platforms, including Giveforward, DonationTo, and Graceful Goodbye, which offer people the chance to ask potential givers for support . But for most crowd-funding projects, the benefit to the creditor is knowing they have contributed to helping a company or person achieve a meaningful goal. The benefit to those supporting a family's funeral costs might simply be peace of mind that they are helping people at a difficult and desperate time. There are now several crowd-funding platforms, including  Giveforward, DonationTo, and Graceful Goodbye, which offer people the chance to ask potential givers for support. Graceful Goodbye is a crowd-funding site dedicated to remembering loved ones - and helping to create a 'memorial fundraiser'. Founded by Josh McClung, a finance expert from Chicago who has formerly worked at Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley, KarpReilly, says he came up with the idea for the funding page after seeing the Sandy Hook elementary school shootings unfurl on TV. 'This unfathomable event coupled with having recently learned about the exorbitant expenses associated with funerals got me thinking about the importance of community and ways in which to help families cope with this financial burden,' he says on his page. 'I wondered, ""how do families pay for funerals, when they cost on average $10,000?"" In search of the answer, I reached out to funeral directors, friends, and families who had lost loved ones. 'I heard incredible stories and discovered just how common it is for families to struggle with the financial burden of saying goodbye. It just didn’t seem right. Through these conversations and my commitment to make things a little easier, Graceful Goodbye was born.' Graceful Goodbye is a crowd-funding site dedicated to remembering loved ones - and helping to create a 'memorial fundraiser' On his site, people can not only raise the funds they need, but also use it as a hub to share memories of loved ones who have passed away. Vice.com has raises some interesting points on the novel funeral-fundraising method. The magazine points out that funerals needn't cost quite so much, if cheaper options are chosen. The $10,000 quoted by Mr McClung would, on average, include the body being embalmed, rested in a lined casket, placed in a room for people to visit, a ceremony at a funeral home, driven to the cemetery in a hearse, lowered into the ground and buried, with some flowers placed at the headstone. Funeral directors get around $6,600 of that, and the rest goes to the cemetery, according to vice. Mr McClung, on his Graceful Goodbye website, points out that he takes 4 per cent for every dollar raised. Mike Pearl, of Vice.com writes: 'I’m not saying there’s anything inherently wrong with this. Just that, personally, I didn’t have any potentially profitable ideas when I was reading the news about Sandy Hook, but that’s my problem, not Josh McClung’s.' Other sites are general crowd-funding platforms, which also include appeals from families to raise funds to cover pricey and unplanned for funeral costs. While Giveforward started out as a fund-generating site for Americans who could not afford costly medical bills, particularly for those with chronic or terminal diseases. The site founders realised adding a funeral crowd-funding platform was a logical step for the struggling families.","Several crowd-funding platforms are offering to help families raise funds to cover the costs of relatives' funerals .

"Mr Bond said he is 'not over it yet' in TV interview . He became world famous after orchestrating Australia's victory over the US in the America's cup . By . Richard Shears . UPDATED: . 11:28 EST, 20 September 2013 . British-born businessman Alan Bond has spoken for the first time since the suicide of his beloved wife Diana Bliss 20 months ago - and admitted that her death and other problems had brought him close to breaking point. 'I'm not over it yet,' the 75-year-old former high flier said in a reference to the time when Miss Bliss was found dead in the swimming pool of their mansion in Western Australia, a tragedy, he said had 'shattered' him. Theatre producer Miss Bliss, 57, died 17 years after she and Bond were married in a high-profile wedding, a marriage he has always said changed his life for the better. Tragedy: Millionaire Alan Bond (right) discovered his wife Diana Bliss (left) dead in the swimming pool at their home in Perth, Western Australia . Miss Bliss had left a suicide note for Mr Bond - a controversial figure in business circles and who served four years in jail for fraud - in which she told him 'My love, I miss you. You will always be with me.' Mr Bond, speaking to Australia's Channel 10 network from his countryside home in England - where he and Miss Bliss had spent so much time together - said that despite giving his wife all his care, he was unable to pull her out of her 'black spot'. 'You do the nurturing. For the 15 months before Di passed away I was a full-time carer for her. 'We never went out and with all the ability of the best medics in the world to treat her, we couldn't get through that barrier. She couldn't get through the barrier.' London-born Mr Bond and Miss Bliss were married in 1992, three years after he divorced his first wife, Eileen - known in Perth's social circles as 'Big Red' - and in the same year that he was declared bankrupt with personal debts of more than £300 million. He told the Revealed show in the TV interview that Diane used to love it in their English home. 'I tried to get her out of her dark spot by bringing her here and she loved the walks. It's just a peaceful place.' Luxury: Miss Bliss, 57, is believed to have been found by Mr Bond floating in the pool of their home (pictured) Aerial view: The swimming pool in the back garden of the couple's mansion is circled in red . It was after he had put bankruptcy and jail time behind him, he settled down to a peaceful life with Miss Bliss - but it was not to be. For his eldest daughter, Suzanne Bond, was found in her Perth home a day after Mr Bond had returned from London in 2000. 'It was about eight months after Diana's death. I came out of the Farm Street Church in London where I had just lit some candles for Di and for Susan, when I was walking back to the hotel and all of a sudden it just lifted. It was like you reach a point and it lifts. 'I think it's a question of are you going to give up, or are you going to go the next 100 yards of your life? And for me, giving up is not really an option.' It was Mr Bond who was behind Australia's victory over the US in the America's Cup 30 years ago - a 'David and Goliath story,' he said - but it was an event that contributed to his financial and legal troubles. Mourning: A grief-filled Mr Bond had spoken only briefly about Miss Bliss's death . 'It made me identifiable all over the world,' he told the TV station. 'If I could achieve a win in the America's cup, is there anything I couldn't do? 'The reality of that is I think the ego got a bit ahead of myself and I really did take on some fantastic projects. 'I became known to all the bankers in the world and they threw money at me.' Now, he says he is just getting on with life. 'I think you have to show that you're bigger than the problems and get on with your life - and make something of your life, which is exactly what I'm doing.' Tragic: Mr Bond is believed to battled desperately to revive his wife, a former air stewardess, and called an ambulance for her . Ms Bliss, who had worked as a Qantas flight attendant, in public relations and later as a successful theatre producer, married Bond in 1995 after he had been discharged as a bankrupt. He was divorced from his first wife, Eileen, three years earlier. Bond, 73, who emigrated with his parents from London to Australia in 1950, began as a signwriter but went on to become a multi-millionaire whose investments in airships, property, breweries and diamond mines enabled him to bankroll challenges for the America’s Cup, the premier international yacht race. In 1983, his Australia II Syndicate won the trophy, which had been  held by the New York Yacht Club since 1851. In 1987, Bond controversially bought Vincent van Gogh’s Irises for £36 million – at the time the highest price paid for a single painting. But the purchase was subsidised by a substantial loan from auctioneer Sotheby’s, which Bond failed to repay. Art experts suggested it may have been a manipulated sale designed to artificially inflate the value. After his empire collapsed, Bond was declared bankrupt in 1992 with personal debts of £1.2 billion. He was jailed for seven years in 1997 after pleading guilty to using his controlling interest in the Bell Resources company to siphon off more than £800 million into the coffers of his Bond Corporation. He served four years in jail and since then he has worked with his son, Craig, to build up a new fortune in oil and diamonds. By 2008, Bond was said to be worth about £170 million.","Mr Bond said he is 'not over it yet' in TV interview .

A vindictive thug who was annoyed with his neighbours poisoned a tree the couple had planted 20 years earlier to mark the memory of their dead unborn baby. Reece Grove, 19, accused Sara, 47, and Martin Coogan, 49, of making too much noise and taking up too many parking spaces. He waited until they went on holiday and then tipped weedkiller over one their flower beds - killing the cherished plant. They discovered that Grove was responsible when the yob posted pictures of himself posing with weedkiller on Facebook. Mr and Mrs Coogan were initially prepared to forgive the attack as a mishap and accept a face-to-face apology from Grove organised by police. But they then insisted on prosecuting him when callous Grove admitted doing it on purpose - and sent them a letter explaining why. In the letter he listed all the reasons he saw that justified his actions. He has now been fined £500 after admitting destruction of property at Medway Magistrates court. Mrs Coogan, an admin assistant of . Strood, Kent, told Medway Magistrates: 'The loss of the tree has now brought back the . memories of losing the baby and made those feelings open sores when they . were healing.

'Me and Sara were out of the country at the time and had left our son in charge of the plants. 'He watered them every day but they started to die and he was racked with guilt for about two weeks after. 'We did not want to give this guy a criminal record, we would have been content with a face-to-face apology.

A court heard that Mr Mahoney grabbed the hood of Ives’ Superman hoodie and threw an 'ineffective' punch at him. Tragic: Ben Mahoney, left, died from a haemorrhage to an artery in his neck cause by sudden twisting witnesses said thug Edward Ives, right, 'went berserk' and attacked him . But Ives, who was high on crack cocaine, angrily swiped Mr Mahoney’s cup of Turkish tea from the counter, splashing it onto his jumper sleeve. He then hit the 30 year-old with such force he left him 'dead standing up' against a fridge. Before leaving he demanded £90 compensation as fatally injured Mr Mahoney slumped unconscious to the floor of the House on the Hill takeaway in Dartford, Kent. The counter staff refused but when Ives threatened to kill everyone in the takeaway they handed him £30 - and a refund for his kebab and two cheeseburgers. Tributes to Ben Mahoney who was beaten to death at the House on the Hill kebab shop in Dartford, Kent, witnesses said he was left slumped against the fridge after the attack . Brutal: Edward Ives flexes his muscles in a picture from his Facebook page, witnesses said the blows he rained down on his victim gave him no chance to retaliate . Ives, a father-of-two, was arrested two hours later when police found him hiding under a child’s bed. A jury heard he had only been released on licence from a prison after being sentenced for witness intimidation six weeks before the attack in April. Ian Hope, prosecuting, said: 'Those watching and those who had tried to stop the first fight were simply too frightened to intervene at all in this fight because of the aggression and violence coming from Ives, the force of the blows he was using and his general conduct to all those in the shop. 'He also demanded payment for the inconvenience of having dirtied his sleeve. 'The terrified staff paid him the £30 he demanded in compensation and the money he had already paid for his kebab and burger. 'He then left, striding out of the restaurant.' A postmortem found Mr Mahoney died at the scene from a haemorrhage to an artery in his neck caused by a sudden and twisting motion. Takeaway manager Cafir Zorlu told Maidstone Crown Court: 'I had never seen a person die before and you could tell he was dead standing up. 'You could hear the punches. 'If Ben didn’t die I’m assuming he would have been paralysed somehow because the punches were just too strong. 'His eyes, the pupils, you could see the pupils. His eyes weren’t there, you know? He was just shaking maybe in shock I suppose. 'I think Ben was throwing up as there was liquid coming out of his mouth. Police at the House on the Hill takeaway in East Hill, Dartford, after an incident in which Ben Mahoney died, Ives allegedly threatened to kill everyone in the shop if he didn't get money back for his troubles . Takeaway manager Cafir Zorlu told the court that he could tell Mr Mahoney was 'dead standing up' after the fight . 'Ben was standing, knocked out. He wasn’t retaliating, he wasn’t fighting back.' Ives, from Dartford, who is pleading self-defence, told the jury it was Mr Mahoney who started the fight. He said he was not looking for trouble and just wanted a kebab. But he admitted taking crack cocaine before entering the takeaway and was upset his girlfriend had thrown him out of her home. Mr Ives, who was an Olympic boxing hopeful at school, told the court he felt 'devastated' about the attack. Heartfelt: Friends Kiley and Kimberley pen an emotional note remembering 'many fun memories' and 'silly escapades' in tribute to Mr Mahoney . He said: 'If I thought he was seriously hurt I would have helped the boy. I didn’t mean to hurt him. It’s just terrible what happened. Tragic. 'I feel devastated. It’s made me feel ill. I have got to live with it for the rest of my life. 'He was only a young lad, weren’t he? Only my age. It’s just a tragic accident. It’s a terrible shame. 'I was a bit upset, do you know what I mean? I went out for a kebab, I didn’t go out for no trouble. I was quite annoyed.' Ives denies manslaughter and the trial continues.

A 'selfish' couple who wiped out a 91-year-old dementia sufferer’s life savings by helping themselves to her bank accounts were jailed for two and a half years today. Lesley Reeve, 56, and husband Andrew, 55, spent all but £3,000 of her godmother Joan Killen’s £130,000 savings after the pensioner allowed them to become a signatory on her bank accounts. The judge said they were guilty of a gross breach of trust and although they had been hard-working throughout their lives, he branded them 'utterly materialistic.' Arriving at court: Andrew and Lesley Reeve, who spent two years splashing her elderly godmother's cash, were jailed toady . The couple cleared debts, bought a car for one of their two sons and spent thousands on electrical goods and presents for themselves, Teesside Crown Court heard during their trial last month. They also spent some of the money converting the garage of their home in Hartlepool into a wet room and gym, but told police the work was really to make it into a bedroom for 'Aunty Joan, who by then was living in a care home. They claimed they loved Miss Killen and said she was happy for them to spend her savings as they saw fit, as she planned to leave them everything in her will. But while the Reeves spent tens of thousands on their family home, Miss Killen lived in a sparsely-decorated room in a care home. On one occasion she asked for her personal effects to be brought in, but when the Reeves failed to do so, a member of staff went out and bought her some earrings and a jewellery box. The couple held hands in the dock as they were sentenced by Judge Simon Bourne-Arton, the Recorder of Middlesbrough today. He told them: 'You were found guilty by the jury on compelling evidence. 'What the jury concluded you did was to strip all the monies that your godmother, Mrs Reeve, had. 'You did so for your own selfish needs.' The court heard that as a result of the Reeves actions Miss Killen, who is still alive, is now relying on the state to pay for her care costs. Judge Bourne-Arton: 'You believed, and you may be right in believing, that she was going to leave all her money to you. 'But you pre-empted that process by deciding to take the money for yourself, at a time when you felt you needed it.' The judge accepted some money was spent doing up the Miss Killen's home, as well as their own, but he said they expected to one day inherit that too, and were renting it out in the meantime to make money for themselves. He added: 'You claimed you loved her, that you cared for her, that you effectively nurtured her and that you did nothing to harm her. 'You did none of that.' Home improvements: Teeside Crown Court heard how Mr and Mrs Reeves used the money they stole to convert their garage into a gym and wet room but lied to police claiming the work was to make room for Miss Killen . He also pointed out that the visits . Mr and Mrs Reeve made to the care home became more infrequent once the . money ran out but  the couple blamed this on a fall-out with the staff. He said: 'This is a gross breach of trust.' 'You have shown throughout these proceedings not one ounce of remorse. 'I have seen nothing, not even a flicker of regret for what you have done, indeed, quite the reverse.' The judge acknowledged that imposing jail on two people of previous good character and of their age would be hard, and that they had lost their good name. But he added:'You no doubt feel you have done well, you have been hard-working. But you are utterly materialistic. Mr Reeve had claimed it was a coincidence that when police arrested the couple in a dawn raid, the gym contained a treadmill and exercise ball, and maintained the conversion was intended for Miss Killen. That story was rejected by the jury who convicted them of stealing £95,000 in savings, and theft of rent money they made from getting a tenant to move into her property when she went into care after a fall. Mrs Reeve was also convicted of stealing £2,940 in pension payments. Paul Abrahams, defending Mr Reeve, said the couple will find it very difficult to be apart in jail having spent their lives together. He also claimed that Mr Reeve, an engineer was likely to lose his job. He said: 'Life will be very difficult for Mr Reeve when he is released,' The couple now face a proceeds of crime hearing which will see them stripped of their assets. Nigel Soppitt, defending Mrs Reeve said: 'She will lose her reputation, her assets including her home, her self-esteem and perhaps her mental health.'","Lesley Reeve, 56, and husband Andrew, 55, bought cars, presents and converted their garage into a wet room .

Brazen: The T shirt worn by a gun gang which carried out violent crimes in Halton and Merseyside over a number of months during early 2013 . A drug-running gun gang felt so untouchable they wore custom made T shirts boasting: 'Uzi Does it' during a reign of terror, a court heard. Jamie Barnett, 23, Brady Cole, 24, Dean Kenton, 29, and Lewis Gandy, 22, were all jailed yesterday at Chester Crown Court after . pleading guilty to a string of firearms and drug offences. The bragging hoodlums proudly showed off the slogan next to a picture of an Uzi sub machine gun as they carried out shootings to enforce drug deals. Their black shirts were found amongst an arsenal of guns during a raid on the gangs fortress HQ at a first floor flat in Widnes, Cheshire. But the members of the deadly armed drugs gang are now behind bars after a dramatic raid where police officers battered down a reinforced door to find a stash of drugs and firearms. Policemen who stormed the gangsters' flat in March this year found a Skorpion sub-machine gun, a loaded Colt .45 pistol and an old-fashioned revolver, along with over 100 rounds of ammunition, stashed in their loft. Jamie Barnett (top-left), Brady Cole (top-right), Dean Kenton (bottom-left) and Lewis Gandy (bottom-right) were all jailed at Chester Crown Court today for drugs and firearm possession offences . Investigators seized this collection of guns and ammunition from the criminals' flat. It includes a revolver (left), a Colt .45 pistol (centre) and a Skorpion sub-machine gun (right) They also recovered a stash of heroin and crack cocaine with a street value of £7,100. Gang leaders Cole and Barnett received 12 years in prison while Kenton and Gandy were handed six-year sentences. Judge Elgin Edwards QC said: . 'Dangerous dogs, a pistol, submachine gun, weapons, body armour, masks, . it was an absolute nightmare scenario. 'These men were glorifying violence, . like designer macho American gangsters. They revelled in gun violence. A . message has to be sent out to people like you and the public at large . that drug violence will not be tolerated.' Their criminal activities started early this year, and ‘brought fear to the streets’ according to investigating officers. Detective Inspector Simon Blackwell of Cheshire Constabulary displays the evidence, seized as part of an armed raid . This dangerous, fully automatic Skorpian sub-machine gun was the most deadly item in the haul . The gang was based in the Halton area of Cheshire, and used a flat in Widnes, Merseyside as their base. When officers raided the first-floor flat after a lengthy investigation, they had to break their way through a door which had been reinforced with half-inch-thick steel bars to reach the criminals inside. Police arrested the four men before finding the array of guns and drugs stashed in the loft of the flat. Forensic investigations were later able to unpick their criminal activities even further as tests linked the seized pistol to previously-reported shootings in the area. Police also found money, and a stash of drugs which included heroin and crack cocaine . The drugs haul from the flat included 48 batches of heroin and 23 batches of crack cocaine, enough for more than 700 individual deals. Officers also found £400 cash, mobile phones, balaclavas and a bulletproof vest used by gang members. The evidence helped convict the men, whom officers said had stockpiled an arsenal previously unheard-of in the area. Detective Inspector Simon Blackwell of Cheshire Constabulary said: ‘This is a significant conviction for Cheshire Police. 'Today′s sentencing sees 4 members of an organised crime gang behind bars for a substantial period of time. The criminals were storing the drugs in what appear to be jars meant for sweets . 'This was a lengthy and complex investigation into the criminal activities of a number of individuals who brought fear to the streets of Halton and Merseyside. 'The discovery of weapons of this kind on this scale within Cheshire is unheard of. Never before have we seen firearms of this type - or ammunition of this quantity - on the streets of the county. 'We hope that the sentences handed down to the defendants will allow them time behind bars to reflect upon their actions - and the implications upon the local community in Halton. 'It is clear that the four men believed they were above the law and now they are paying the ultimate price for their criminal activity.' Maria Corr, senior prosecutor from the . Crown Prosecution Service Mersey Cheshire, said: 'These men were . prepared to use guns and violence to pursue their criminal trade and . used those firearms as they expanded that trade into Cheshire.'","Jamie Barnett, 23, Brady Cole, 24, Dean Kenton, 29, and Lewis Gandy, 22, were jailed today for drugs and firearm offences .

ASBO breach: Noisy Julie Griffiths outside her home where she shouted at her husband Norman so much it has kept neighbours awake for years . The neighbours of a woman branded the wife-from-hell have revealed recordings of her screaming rants at her long-suffering husband. Julie Griffiths, 43, was hauled before magistrates last week for breaching her ASBO by shouting, swearing and slamming doors as she repeatedly berated husband Norman, 63. Despite the constant disturbance to those living near Griffiths' home in Talke, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, she was given a 12-month conditional discharge and told to pay £85 in court costs. Her outraged neighbours have now revealed their disgust at the sentence and made public recordings of outbursts which have been making their lives a misery. Neighbours made the recordings after the local council installed noise nuisance monitoring equipment following numerous complaints. Griffiths can be heard in the tapes published by The Sun screaming at her husband to leave their house, swearing at him and threatening to 'smash' him if she doesn't do what she says. In one recording at 8.57am on August 27, she can be heard shouting: 'Get out if you want a fag. Go! You’re not smoking in bed, I said get out if you want a fag! Get out if you want a fag! Get your shoes on and get out if you want a fag. Now get out.’ Griffiths then continues her rant, screeching: ‘Not gone yet, can’t hear the door, get your shoes on and get out, otherwise you’l know about it. Get out, Do I have to say it again.’ In another she tell her husband: 'Don't worry Norman, I'm just about sick of you!' In other clips, she makes it clear she is aware that her neighbours are recording her, but continue to scream at her husband. She says: 'Stop ignoring me, you are. I am being recorded by them next door now thanks to you.' 'They are recording every day. Because of you  I keep f*****g up.' The 43-year-old received a five-year ASBO in December last year for disturbing residents near her home in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. But she was hauled before the courts again last week because she was still going berserk at her husband. She claimed she had not understood the conditions of the ASBO but pleaded guilty at North Staffordshire Justice Centre to breaching the order between April 18 and August 27 this year. Despite previously being fined £750 and warned she faced up to five years in jail if she breached the order, Griffiths escaped a prison sentence. Friends revealed the couple have been married for more than 20 years but Griffiths' nagging became an issue three years ago. She has been banned from numerous family events because of her tantrums.

While tickets issued on Sundays have increased by 13 per cent . It is believed the rise of Sunday shopping has prompted more town halls to crack down on parking on a day when rules were traditionally relaxed.

An illegal immigrant married by the now Archbishop of York claimed £138,000 worth of benefits and made a hefty profit selling her council house back to a cash-strapped local authority. Bigamist Rebecca Muwonge, 47, entered the country from Uganda in 1996 using the name of her 18-year-old niece Proscovia Kasozi, and immediately claimed for short-term housing benefit. The London Borough of Newham granted her short-term accommodation twice under that name while she used her real identity to pocket benefits from the London Borough of Enfield.

Mother-of-five Muwonge was married to Samuel Bisaso, 47, at the Holy Trinity Church in Tulse Hill, south London by John Sentamu in 1996. Dr Sentamu, who was appointed Archbishop of York in 2005, later ordained Mr Bisaso as a clergyman in the Church of Uganda, and he went on to be a Church of England chaplain for the Mission to Seafarers church charity in Immingham, near Grimsby. The couple had a troubled marriage and although they never divorced, Muwonge married another man while the pair were separated.

The prosecution accepted that the only evidence they had against him was that he was married to Muwonge and that he lived with her.

Locked up with Corral on the massive drug charge was Juan Alberto Contreras-Ramirez, 40, who was arrested Wednesday in connection to Perez’s harrowing abduction that came to a merciful end Wednesday when Perez was returned to her family. Scroll down for video...

Along with 29-year-old Wildrego . Jackson, Contreras-Ramirez was nabbed during a massive manhunt that . began in the early morning hours Tuesday after two men broke into . Corral’s Ellenwood, Georgia home and took the teen girl when they left. The . Georgia Bureau of Investigation released sketches of the two African . American men and an alert was raised asking people to keep an out for . them and the grey sedan in which they drove away after shooting the . family dog and taking the girl hostage. At . the time, police believed the crime was random. They had only lived in . the house for a month, Corral said. And even after Wednesday’s arrest, . the two kidnappers remained suspects in the crime and at large. Snatched: Armed invaders stole Ayvani Hope Perez, 14, away from her family Tuesday and shot her dog. She was safely returned Wednesday . Busted: Wildrego Jackson (in mugshots from 2011, left,  and 2013, right) has a long criminal history that includes cruelty to children and has added a conspiracy to kidnap charge to the list after Wednesday's arrest in connection with Ayvani Perez's abduction . The terrifying incident, which saw the . shooting of the innocent family dog, seemed like a quintessential . shattering of suburban tranquillity. But . a new twist came Thursday when WSB-TV learned that the kidnapped girl’s . mother was arrested in February 2012 with Contreras-Ramirez and three . other men. The group was . found in Stockbridge, Georgia home where 500 pounds of marijuana and . $3,000 cash were uncovered during a drug raid, according to the Henry Daily Herald. Terrified: The 4-foot-9, teen was wrenched from her mother around 2am Tuesday while she was still wearing her Star Wars pajamas . Corral is not believed to have been living in the home. Contreras-Ramirez . and Corral were later released when the charges were dropped, but the . new information makes the kidnapping that had a nation fearing the worst . for nearly 36 hours appear far from random.

Along . with him was Wildrego Jackson, a man with an extensive criminal history . that includes child cruelty as well as various drug and assault . charges. Jackson, whose upwards of 14 aliases have included Wildrego . Johnson and Travis Gray, was held on a conspiracy to kidnap charge. Now Perez is home with her family and two men are locked up in connection to her abduction, but the saga is far from over. ‘We believe those two suspects in the drawings are still at large,’ said FBI Special Agent Rick Maxwell. Clayton County Police Chief Greg Porter also remained confident that an arrest would be made soon. ‘We have more than 100 officers involved,’ he said Wednesday. In the hours following the kidnapping, friends, family, and even concerned strangers quickly posted Amber Alerts and other announcements on social media. We got her: Clayton County Police Chief Gregory Porter made the announcement at a press event Wednesday afternoon but remained tight-lipped about how Perez was recovered . Pictured: Police sketches show the two African American men who authorities say took Ayvani after their demands for money and jewelry went unmet. Even after two men were apprehended Wednesday in connection to the crime, authorities said these men remained on the loose . Ongoing: FBI assistant apecial agent Ricky Maxwell announced that two men were in custody but that the men in the police sketches remained at large. He declined to give further details due to the 'ongoing' case . Suspicious: Ayvani was reunited with her family Wednesday, but speculation has now arisen over her mother's connection to men pinned to the kidnapping . A prayer vigil was also held at a local high school and 150 people attended. ‘She's so nice,’ one attendee told 11alive.com. ‘I don't know why people would do this to her. I'm praying just to get her home safely.’ Another classmate was struggling to come to grips with the situation. ‘I don't get it,’ said Sydney Chaquir. ‘It's not clicking in my mind why somebody would do this to her. It's like a dream.’ Clayton County Georgia police spokesman Phong Nguyen said Tuesday the invasion appears to be completely random. ‘It didn’t appear that they knew each other,’ he said. ‘They just moved in about a month ago.’ Nguyen said the two African American males smashed through a back door of the home and Maria Perez quickly tried to hide her children, but the men found Ayvani. The men wanted money and jewelry, but Maria had none to give, so they took the girl instead. The abductors escaped with Perez in a grey Dodge or Chevrolet sedan and were described as wearing dark clothing. Perez was believed to be in extreme danger and a Levi's Call—Georgia's version of the Amber alert—was activated. Senseless: Two black males in dark clothing broke into Perez's Ellenwood, Georgia home at 2am Tuesday. When her mother had no valuables, they shot the dog and took Ayvani . Spreading the word: Many friends and even concerned strangers quickly took to social media to spread word of Ayvani's kidnapping and to gather information . Authorities said Wednesday that Perez was healthy at the time of her reunion with her family. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation released sketches of the two men who kidnapped Perez from the 3800 block of Brookgate Drive. Those men are still on the loose and Clayton County police urge anyone who may have information to call (678) 610-4781 immediately. Relief: Around 150 of Ayvani's classmates and former classmates gathered at a Hampton, Georgia high school for a Tuesday night prayer vigil. Their prayers were answered Wednesday .

Beggars, down and outs and vagrants have been used for generations by painters and sculptors to represent the virtue of charitable giving in their artworks. And as these stunning pictures show, beggars became a hugely popular theme for postcards in the early part of the last century. Renowned British art dealer John Kasmin was so fascinated by the unflinchingly stark images of the characters who made their living on streets all over the world that he collected hundreds and they have now been published in a new book. 'Beggars made good subjects for cards. Exaggerated characters or heart string pullers' Mr Kasmin explained. 'They knew how to pose, how to present the face, the posture of neediness, dereliction, despair - it was their livelihood, their ability.' The postcard on the left was sent by a German soldier in the First World War, who took a picture of this beggar in Romania. 'Edel' means 'noble' in German, and 'Panje' is the same world translated into a Slavic language. The soldier gave him some tobacco for posing. The picture on the right, which was processed in the UK, is of a beggar in Shanghai. He was begging for food - his rice bowl and chopsticks can be seen in the background. The date of the photograph is uncertain. This mother and boy seem happy to pose in the postcard on the left, which was taken in India. Mr Kasmin suggests that the woman's clothes may have been very precisely arranged by the photographer. The woman on the right, pictured in the Béarn region of southern France, is better dressed than most. Two lines of poetry in a French dialect have been printed on the bottom of the card . This pair of Chinese beggars - pictured in a French postcard which mentions a Jesuit mission in the area - are grandfather and grandson . There may, however, be a more unpleasant reason behind the boom in postcards of the needy - the gratification of seeing others worse off. '(The postcards) might . signify only delight in human variety, but might also imply . schadenfreude - there but for the grace of God go we.' he said. 'We (sender and receiver) celebrate our superiority, poor though we may be.' In 'Want: Kasmin's Postcards', Mr Kasmin points to another more practical reason why the beggars would have been the perfect subject for photographers of the time: their lifestyles. 'They were used to holding still, thus aiding photographers who were obliged, in those days, to make long exposures with plate cameras'. Mr Kasmin is credited with discovering David . Hockney, and was one of the first art dealers to open a vast modern . gallery space in London; but his latest project is a fascinating study of the psychology of the down and outs and why people wanted images of them. The collection has photographs from all over Europe, as well as China and India. There is even a representation from Bradford, England. The beggar in the left-hand postcard, who has only one coin in his hat, had his picture taken in Bolivia by a representative of a mining company. The children on the left were photographed in Quimper, Brittany in France. On the reverse of the right-hand postcard above, a boy has written a message home to his mother from school. It is signed with 'a thousand big kisses from your little Alphonse who loves you, and kisses to little Marcel'. The largest part of the collection, however, comes from France, which in 1905 had a staggering one per cent of the population begging for alms. But despite their varied origins - the photographs give an unapologetic insight into the lives of the destitute. Some characters remain cheerful, looking carefree as they beam for the camera - despite lacking basic comforts such as shoes, food and of course money. Others look worn and exhausted as they hold out their hands for a coin or two - but in spite of their poverty their gaze remains proud and dignified. In some pictures, generations of begging families pose together, showing how once born into poverty it was difficult to escape to a better life. 'Salt Jim', left, begged in Bradford, Yorkshire, and would traditionally ask for a half-penny. The man on the right, photographed in Tours, France, in 1910 is wearing a traditional shepherd's outfit as he begs . Two local characters from France are show here. On the left a beggar known as 'Chicot' waits for the residents of Chartres, France - mischievously described on the card as 'clients' - to give him money. The card on the right, showing 'the famous Gogo' was sent as a love note in 1905, from an anonymous gentlemen telling the object of his affections that he 'thinks only of her'. Postcards were an extremely popular way of staying in touch with others during the early 20th century. Before the widespread use of the telephone, and before the invention of the internet, they were an affordable way of communicating with loved ones - and even for courting potential suitors. Collecting them developed into a huge craze, particularly between 1907 and 1913. The first postcard appeared in Austria in 1869, before arriving in Britain a year later. During World War I, they became a vital link between people, as just about everybody would use the cheap cards to stay in touch with one another.","Art dealer John Kasmin collected 100 postcards for book showing poverty-stricken people from all across the world .

Case: The jury at Mark Duggan's inquest will hear evidence from a witness who claims she saw police plant a gun at the scene of his death . A judge took the highly unusual step of leading his court in a moment’s silence to commemorate Mark Duggan, the alleged gangster whose death sparked the 2011 riots which scarred Britain. Judge Keith Cutler, sitting at Duggan’s inquest, asked everyone inside the courtroom to fall silent and to acknowledge the ‘regrettable loss of a young life’. Later the inquest heard Duggan was a member of one of Britain’s most notorious gangs and was shot by a police marksman who believed the suspect was about to fire a revolver in a crowded street. Judge Cutler, sitting as a coroner at the High Court, led the 20-second silence by lowering his head and clasping his hands together. Addressing the jury, he said: ‘It is right that you should know that present in court today are a number of Mark Duggan’s family and friends and to acknowledge the grief of those family and friends and to respect that loss we will together just have some moments of silence as we sit here to recognise the seriousness of the hearing for which we are about to undertake.’ The request for a moment’s silence was understood to have been made by Duggan’s family and supporters. Inquests, by their nature, involve the passing of a loved one, but are not generally used to commemorate someone’s death. The decision to hold a period of silence at the start of an inquest is virtually unprecedented. Key evidence: A photograph of the gun, shown to the jury at the Royal Courts of Justice as part of the two-month inquest . Case: Photograph shows a gun in a sock found 10-20ft away from Mark Duggan, 29, when he was shot dead by police in Tottenham . The inquest heard yesterday how Duggan . was shot twice by a police marksman after the officer saw him raise a . gun wrapped in a sock towards him. One . bullet hit the 29-year-old in his right bicep and the other hit him in . the chest, which killed him ‘in 10 heartbeats’, it was said. Judge Keith Cutler asked everyone inside the courtroom to fall silent and to acknowledge the 'regrettable loss of a young life' Moments . before he was killed, the taxi in which he was travelling was stopped . by armed police during the evening rush-hour in Tottenham, north London, . on August 4, 2011. The . father-of-four, who had taken the party drug Ecstasy, then ran out of . the Toyota minicab holding the gun, the court was told. The . firearms officer, known only by his codename of V53, opened fire in . ‘self-defence’ because he thought Duggan posed a ‘lethal threat’. When . officers looked for the gun they thought he was holding they found it . up to 20 feet away on the other side of a wall from where he was killed, . the inquest heard. Counsel . for the inquest Ashley Underwood, QC, said armed officers tried to shock . Duggan ‘into submission’ by performing a ‘hard stop’ on the taxi by . blocking it with three unmarked police cars. Addressing . the jury, he said: ‘Regrettably you will hear it didn’t work, in the . sense that Mr Duggan wasn’t shocked into submission,’ he said. ‘He . got out of the minicab and he ran.

"By . Ted Thornhill . PUBLISHED: . 07:04 EST, 20 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:30 EST, 20 September 2013 . Three British sailors underwent a dramatic rescue when they were shipwrecked off Turkey during a violent storm. The three men, all in their 60s, were stranded aboard the yacht 'Concorde of Hamble' for 14 hours as Turkish emergency services battled the elements to reach them, stranded below a cliff face near the fishing village of Datca. As the raging sea battered them onto the rocks, the Turkish coastguard were beaten back by the waves. The coastguard summoned the jandarma (army police) for help but the gale force winds and high seas meant they, too, were unable to reach the terrified sailors. Washed up: The yacht was stranded below a cliff face near the fishing village of Datca . Danger: Turkish coastguard officials feared that the yacht would sink . Regarding land rescue 8th/9th September 2013 . Dear members of Akut, on the above night I was fortunate enough to be rescued by members of your team. My . friends and I were shipwrecked on some rocks opposite Kos and your . organization were informed of our plight. You can imagine our relief . when we were told of your impending arrival. Obviously . we had to wait a while because, as we found out later your team had to . come from Marmaris and trek across two mountains to find us. The relief we felt when eight torch lights appeared over the top of the rise was enormous. Once . the team members were with us, their professionalism was unbelievable. They immediately took control and enquired of our condition. Hot drinks . and food were supplied and our condition was assessed and verified to be . OK. All our wet clothes were removed and new ones were supplied and a fire was built to dry us and them out. We thought, once this was done, they were going to leave whilst we waited for the coastguard to arrive. To their credit they stayed with us all night - keeping our spirits up and looking after us.'If it had not been for them I am sure hypothermia would have set in and the end result would have been disastrous!! My . heartfelt thanks are sent to all your team members and your . organization as without you I am sure I would not be writing this . letter. THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART! Denis Maher. Fearing the listing yacht would sink at any moment AKUT, the Turkish volunteer mountain rescue team trekked over two mountains and scaled down the cliff face to reach the desperate Brits. Securing the yacht to the rocks and helping the exhausted sailors onto a tiny isolated beach, AKUT, built a campfire and dished out warm clothes and tea, comforting the cold and shocked crew until sunrise when the storm finally passed. And now the grateful storm survivors have told how they owe their lives to the incredible efforts of the Turkish rescue teams. The three silver-haired sailors, Alan Cooper, Trevor Clark and Denis Maher, were cruising around the Greek Islands and had set sail in the Aegean from the Island of Symi heading to Kos when they were caught in the storm late in the afternoon of Sunday September 8. Blown miles off course they ran aground on needle sharp rocks at the point where the Mediterranean sea meets the Aegean and the two strong currents merge. Stuck fast, severely listing and taking on water the men radioed for help but after the coastguard and jandarma were defeated by the storm they summoned AKUT - a volunteer mountain rescue service famed throughout Turkey for their incredible derring-do. AKUT set out from Marmaris - nearly 50 miles away - but reaching Datca they still had to cross two mountain peaks on foot before scaling down the cliff face with all their rescue equipment. Waiting aboard the sinking yacht Mr Maher explained, in a letter (right), the joy and relief he and his friends felt on seeing the ACUT torches appear through the darkness. At first light, after the storm passed, the coastguard arrived at the inaccessible cove and took the three battered Brits on an inflatable dinghy to shore. They were examined at Bodrum Hospital but had suffered no lasting damage and have since returned to the UK none the worse for their ordeal. For AKUT the incredible rescue is all part of a day's work. The crack rescue team was first established in 1996 as an association of unpaid volunteer members in Istanbul under the leadership of the renowned Turkish mountaineer Nasuh Mahruki. The organization delivers emergency and disaster relief to people trapped in caves, lost on mountains or to victims of earthquake or flood disasters both at home and abroad.","The men, all in their 60s, were stranded for 14 hours before being rescued .

Labour was engulfed by bitter recriminations yesterday after a new book reopened the wounds of the Blair-Brown years. Douglas Alexander was forced to deny claims from former spindoctor Damian McBride that he knifed his politician sister Wendy. The shadow foreign secretary is said to have told Gordon Brown ‘that she had to quit’ following a row about donations to her Scottish Labour leadership campaign. Allegations: Damian McBride claims that Douglas Alexander, left, knifed hi politician sister Wendy, right, allegations that he denies . ‘If I was sometimes cold-blooded about how I did my job, I had nothing on Douglas that day,’ Mr McBride wrote in his memoir. Mr Alexander said: ‘I always supported my sister and I never supported Damian McBride. That might explain why he writes about me in those terms. 'He was discredited when he left Downing Street and that’s really all there is to say. ‘The style and approach of the politics he embodied has been completely discredited and thankfully the Labour party has moved on. 'I support Ed Miliband’s efforts to remove that type of politics from our party.’ When asked whether Mr McBride was lying, Mr Alexander replied: ‘It’s what Damian McBride does.’ Explosive allegations: Damian McBride made a series of claims in his new book . The Mail asked his sister yesterday about the claims and she simply said ‘I’ll leave that’ before closing the door. A senior Labour source said: ‘Damian McBride helped us lose the last election and now it looks like he’s trying to lose us the next one as well.’ Mr McBride revealed in his book that he sought to end the careers of former home secretaries John Reid and Charles Clarke by leaking damaging allegations about them. Neither was prepared to comment yesterday but David Blunkett, another Labour home secretary, rounded on Mr McBride. He said: ‘It takes no intellectual effort  at all to churn out scurrilous tittle tattle and to rubbish those who you were supposed to be supporting, and whose lives were spent improving the wellbeing of others. ‘I had very few dealings with Damian McBride and no policy or campaigning contact with him at all. 'This now turns out to be extremely fortunate. It also demonstrates that, whatever Damian thinks, the world did not revolve around him or his machinations.’ Tony Blair’s former spindoctor Alastair Campbell tweeted: ‘Politics is a team game and the best players are the team players. ‘Gordon Brown had many many strengths and did some great things. But why he needed people like Damian McBride and Charlie Whelan [is] a mystery.’ Mario Dunn, who was former Health Secretary Alan Johnson’s special adviser, said: ‘Usually I don’t get agitated but this McBride stuff is really p***ing me off. #traitor.’ Hitting out: David Blunkett rounded on Mr McBride and his 'scurrilous tittle tattle' Ian McKenzie, an adviser to the former deputy prime minister John Prescott and leader of the House of Commons Anne Taylor, suggested Mr Brown should have fired Mr McBride, who was branded ‘McPoison’ by his critics. ‘I never witnessed anything like McPoison confession,’ he wrote. ‘Both my ministers would’ve sacked me forthwith.’ Mark Davies, who worked for Jack Straw, said: ‘Exactly. I had a very clear understanding of what was acceptable and what was not. Transgression would have meant exit.’ In a bizarre echo of the Blair-Brown wars that tore Labour apart for a decade, Ben Wegg-Prosser – a former aide to Lord Mandelson – yesterday sought to undermine Mr McBride’s revelations. He leaked his Downing Street emails at the time of the ‘Curry House Plot’, in which Mr Brown’s allies succeeded in forcing Tony Blair to name a date for his retirement. Mr Wegg-Prosser calls Mr McBride ‘Damian McP***kface’ in the emails. He wrote yesterday: ‘Brown’s team were convinced the answer to every problem which Labour faced was that Blair should go. ‘The sheer emotional energy these scrapes consumed does not reflect well on any of the participants – me included. Everyone who participated in them, from ministers, MPs, advisers and many more civil servants than is ever acknowledged, should reflect on what else could have been achieved if we weren’t fighting.’ Mr McBride hit back, saying: ‘I suppose the virtue of publishing old emails and diaries is it doesn’t require any self-criticism from those whose egos prevent that.’ Hilary Benn, Labour communities spokesman, told the BBC: ‘This is the past, we’ve changed. ‘Some of what happened is pretty unedifying but it is a postscript on the past. Damian McBride in the end lost his job, and rightly so given what was revealed, but that was a long time ago.’","Damian McBride's book has reopened the wounds of the Blair-Brown years .

Case: The jury at Mark Duggan's inquest will hear evidence from a witness who claims she saw police plant a gun at the scene of his death . An eyewitness will accuse police of planting a gun near the body of Mark Duggan after they shot him. Duggan, whose death sparked the 2011 riots in England, was shot twice by a marksman who had halted his taxi. Officers insist the 29-year-old had a gun wrapped in a sock and was raising it ready to use lethal force. But a witness, known only as Miss J, insists police took a weapon from the taxi and left it near the scene. The claim emerged yesterday just before the jury at Duggan’s inquest was taken to the street in Tottenham, north London, where he was shot in August 2011. Ashley Underwood, QC, counsel to the inquest, told jurors they would hear evidence from Miss J. ‘She lived nearby and she said she was close enough to see the colour of the gloves somebody was wearing when doing CPR (on Duggan),’ he said. ‘I need to explore with Miss J whether her evidence suggests the police took the gun from the minicab and planted it. 'All of that evidence will give you the opportunity to explore that possibility.’ The inquest has heard that the officer who pulled the trigger, known by his codename of V53, says he acted in self defence.

A dog had emergency surgery after eating two pounds of gravel from her owners’ driveway. Snickers the dog was taken to the vets when 12-year-old owner Ryan Jones noticed a bulge in her belly and thought she was pregnant. But when vets looked at an X-ray they saw she had actually swallowed 140 gravel chippings. Tasty snack: Three-year-old Snickers swallowed 140 gravel stones from her owner's driveway . Hungry? An X-Ray shows the mound of stones the dog consumed sitting in her stomach . They rushed the animal, a cross between a springer and cocker spaniel, into emergency surgery and retrieved the stones from her stomach. The boy's father, Warren Jones, of Gorseinon, South Wales, said: 'We’ve always thought she was nuts, totally full of it, which is why we called her Snickers, after the chocolate bar. 'But we never expected her to actually swallow the stones.' Schoolboy Ryan first noticed Snicker's bulge on August Bank Holiday and urged his father to have her checked out. Quite the snack! Some of the two pounds of chippings the animal gobbled up from the family driveway .

Landscaper Mr Jones said: 'I knew she wasn’t pregnant, but we could feel there was something in her belly. 'Ryan was really worried, and we had to take her to the vets, who said he was concerned something had gone into her intestine. So she had to have an operation. 'The operation cost a fair bit of money, but we had to have it done.' Snickers isn't alone in enjoying the taste of stones. Earlier this month, springer spaniel Flo ate 14 pebbles, weighing 1lb, in just one day. The two-year-old animal fell ill after eating the stones, which were 'rattling' in her stomach . Owners Graham Ellis and Lisa Coppack rushed the dog to a vet in Abersoch, North Wales, where an x-ray revealed what the animal had been swallowing. Flo is now recovering after an operation to remove them . The family have said that Snickers, a working dog that accompanies Mr Jones on shoots, would regularly chew chippings from the driveway of the family home. But instead of spitting them out, she had been swallowing them. The operation was carried out by Susanne Ackroyd and Janet Mathews of Haven Vets. Vet Mrs Ackroyd said: 'This was a bit unusual, it was a first for me. 'You could feel the stones grinding away. 'Fortunately the operation was not too difficult because they had gone straight into the stomach. If they had migrated through the bowel it would have been much more evasive.

Special needs: Walter Bartolomucci, who is 28 but has the mental age of a nine-year-old, was held in jail for a week without any word to his parents . A disabled man with the mental age of a nine-year-old was jailed for nearly a week without his medication and with no word to his parents. Walter Bartolomucci, 28, who is rarely apart from his mother, was held at Bergen County Jail in New Jersey where, his parents say, he suffered panic attacks. There was no attempt to contact his worried parents - still his legal guardians - who only eventually learned of their son's whereabouts from a family friend. But that was not the end of Bartolomucci's ordeal. Facing charges of robbery and assault, he was held in a cell for six days because his family were unable to stump up the $50,000 bail. Bartolomucci says his disabilities made him a target of some warders. 'Some of the guards know about my special needs, some of the guards treat me mean,' he said. Those charges - and the massive bail requirement - were subsequently dropped and Bartolomucci was eventually released from jail on Tuesday. His parents are furious at the treatment he received. 'You have to tell Walter to do everything,' said his mother, Joanie Bartolomucci. 'That's why we have to tell him every day: you have to take your shower, you have to brush your teeth.' Bartolomucci was arrested on September 11 at a Pathmark outlet in Bergenfield, where he had been taken by his cousin while Mrs Bartolomucci was in hospital undergoing surgery, her husband by her side. Police told NBC News that that the cousin had egged on Bartolomucci to put some VHS tapes in his bag and steal them. When he was caught, he allegedly swung the bag at a Pathmark worker who tried to stop him. He was arrested on charges of robbery and assault. 'As soon as he starts talking to you, you can tell': Bartolomucci with his outraged mother Joanie, whose side he rarely leaves but who was in hospital undergoing an operation on the day that he was arrested . Bartolomucci, whose disability is evident from his stutter and physical appearance, told NBC how he cried in the police car as he was taken away. His mother said: 'They could clearly see, when they arrested him, that he was special. And I'm sure the girl, the manager, could clearly see that he was special. 'As soon as he starts talking to you, you can tell.' 'Some of the guards know about my special needs, some of the guards treat me mean': Bergen County jail where Bartolomucci was held for six days with no access to medication after his family could not make bail . Nevertheless, Bergenfield police judged that Bartolomucci was mentally sound enough to be jailed. His parents, meanwhile, had no idea where their son was. 'We were never notified as his parents and his guardians, we were never notified of anything,' said Mrs Bartolomucci. Bartolomucci was finally released on Tuesday with no explanation, his bail requirements dropped. His lawyer told NBC that prosecutors had dropped the robbery and assault charges after a review. He still faces a disorderly person charge.","Walter Bartolomucci, 28, is rarely separated from his mother Joanie .

But one photographer ventured just a few miles away from the multi-million dollar mansions and film studios to experience a different side of the city. Visiting some of Los Angeles' most down-trodden parts, he witnessed the struggle of people living on the streets. Rugged: Photographer Michael Pharaoh . took photos of homeless people during a visit to Hollywood . Project: The New Zealander spent two days walking the streets of the city's poorest areas and took pictures of as many of the homeless as he could, including this old man and a woman . Impoverished: This woman has a blackened face through living on the streets . Michael Pharoah, 22 from New Zealand was on holiday in the United States when he decided to take on the project. He said he was humbled by individuals who told him stories about how they had ended up on the streets. He said: 'I was recently on . holiday in America and visited Hollywood, I thought this would be a good . opportunity to exercise my photography skills. 'I decided to walk around for a couple of days to how many photos I could take of all of the homeless people. It was fascinating to me because we don't have the same plethora of homeless people as L.A. 'It was interesting to hear all of their stories and how they came to live on the streets.

Many have blackened skin and clothes from where they have not been able to wash, while others have overgrown facial hair. One also had a bandage wrapped around his head, showing that life on the streets had taken its toll. The New Zealand photographer captured many close-ups of his subject's eyes, revealing wrinkled skin and scars on their faces.

The father who brutally murdered his 20-year-old daughter and her boyfriend after the young couple eloped has defended his actions, saying he did 'the right thing.' Narender Barak has confessed to Thursday's honour killings in north-west India, adding that more people should followed his example. Nidhi Barak and her boyfriend Dharmender, 23, had run away from their village in the state of Haryana to marry in nearby Delhi, but returned on the promise they had her parents blessing. Gruesome: The body of one of the two honor killing victims lies under a sheet in Gharnavati village in the Indian state of Haryana .

The . killers then attacked Dharmender, who was studying at a local techincal . college, breaking the bones in his arms and legs before beheading him . and dumping his body in front of his family home. Narender Barak, a wrestler and dog breeder, confessed to the murders alongside his wife. 'Whatever I did was right and for honour,' he told local media. 'If others also follow the same path, then such things [marriages for love] won't take place.' Police say they discovered the girl's parents cremating her body on a pyre. The body of the boyfriend was dumped outside his family home . The pair, both members of the Barak clan, had eloped to  Delhi on Tuesday because their families did not approve of their three-year relationship. However, Ms Barak was promised by her family that they would not be harmed and would finally be allowed to marry. Miss .

According to police the couple were tortured for several hours at Miss Barak's home before she was beaten to death in full public view. Dharmender Barak . was beaten and his arms and legs broken, before he was beheaded. His . body was allegedly dumped near his family's home at a public square in . the village. Police, who had been alerted by a villager, reportedly caught Miss Barak's family cremating her body on a pyre. Her half-burnt body and that of Dharmender Barak have been sent for a post-mortem. Local police chief Anil Kumar said: 'While murdering the boy they also beheaded him. 'We . have arrested her father, mother and uncle and we are looking for her . brother, a friend and driver of the car in which the couple were brought . back to her home in Gharnavati village. 'Both belonged to the same village and the same caste. It is an honour killing but the murder was not approved by society.' India has for centuries seen killings that often target young couples who have relationships of which their families, clans or communities, particularly in traditional rural areas, disapprove. There are no official figures on honour killings in India, but the All India Democratic Women's Association says its research shows about 1,000 such cases nationwide a year.","Narender Barak had admitted to murdering his daughter and her boyfriend .

In a major boost for the global economy, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 15000 points for the first time on Tuesday. Ending the day 87 points up on Monday, the Dow closed up 0.6 percent to 15,056.20 - the latest landmark in a near four-year rally which has seen the stock market rise 130 percent. The historic gains will fuel growing confidence in the U.S. economy, but the Federal Reserve is not expected to relax its policy of keeping interest rates at almost zero - seen by many as a key supporting factor in the rise of the Dow. Record: The Dow Jones Industrial Average today reached its highest ever level at 15,013 . Analysts have attributed the steady rise of the NYSE to investors fear of missing out on the rally replacing their concerns about the risk of a sell off. Earlier today, the stockmarket hit new highs as the Dow passed a record-breaking 15,000. The index, which tracks the value of 30 of the biggest American companies, smashed through 15,000, before falling back slightly. The . S&P 500 also reached its highest level ever as the prolonged stock . rally showed no sign of slowing down despite the struggling global . economy. The S&P . has risen for three straight days, increasing more than 13 per cent so . far this year - more than in the whole of 2012. Yesterday it closed at a record high of 1,617, and today reached an intraday high of 1,620. The strong performance of equities in recent days has been attributed to last week's strong employment figures from the U.S., as well as the Federal Reserve's stimulus programme. Healthy profits at major U.S. corporations are also driving the market higher. More than 80 per cent of companies in the S&P 500 have reported their first quarter-earnings, and profits are at a record level. However, revenues have been less promising as gross sales have falled short of expectations so far this year. The Dow, which is up more than 14 per cent this year, first passed 15,000 on Friday, but has still never closed above that level in any given day. Both of the main indices have been setting a series of records after regaining all of the losses they suffered in the 2008 financial crisis. Recent gains have been especially strong in technology and banking, which tend to rise or fall sharply in sync with the overall health of the global economy. Another good sign for the global economy is that the price of ultra-safe assets such as U.S. government bonds has been falling, showing investors are ready to take more risks with their money. However, renewed turmoil in the eurozone and the risk of U.S. government shutdown could yet shake world market in the months to come.","Dow reaches closes at 15, 056 as S&P 500 also hits record .

When arrested the couple told police that they thought they were arranging clients for employees hired to give massages on the third floor of the Landmark building in Springfield, Missouri.

The charges claim that detectives found the business advertised on a website called backpage.com under the adult category and made contact to establish what was offered and the cost, KY3.com reported last year.

Lord Justice Leveson's report has faced criticism from leaders of the Press who claim the inquiry and subsequent report has left all sides dissatisfied . The legal chief of The Guardian newspaper says the outcome of the Leveson Inquiry is ‘the worst of all worlds’. Gill Phillips, whose newspaper was instrumental in sparking the inquiry into media standards, says that what Lord Justice Leveson recommended has been  ‘disastrous’. She describes one key Leveson recommendation, championed by lobby group Hacked Off and Labour politicians and previously backed by The Guardian, as ‘a charter for people with dodgy claims’. It was an incendiary Guardian report in 2011 – which wrongly accused News of the World journalists of deleting messages on murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s mobile phone – that provoked a public outcry. The inaccurate story brought about the closure of the Sunday tabloid and led to David Cameron establishing the inquiry under Lord Justice Leveson. But Ms Phillips says the wrangling over Press regulation following last year’s inquiry and subsequent report has left all sides dissatisfied. She said: ‘His attempt to please everybody and avoid being a dusty footnote on a shelf somewhere has led him down a road that has proved to be pretty disastrous. We don’t have anything that could be perceived as effective or credible by either side of the debate.’ Since Lord Justice Leveson’s report was published last November there has been disagreement between publishers, politicians and lobby groups over how to implement his recommendations for tougher Press regulation. The Privy Council is currently considering a Royal Charter put forward by the newspaper and magazine industry after negotiation with ministers. A rival charter, agreed over 2am pizzas by politicians and the Hacked Off lobby group, has yet to be submitted. The newspaper industry plans to launch early next year a tough new Press watchdog, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, with the power to impose fines of up to £1million for systemic wrongdoing and require editors to publish upfront corrections. But some critics of the industry, led by Hacked Off, are demanding politicians have the last say over Press regulation.Ms Phillips, the Guardian’s director of editorial legal  services, dismissed the use of royal charters as a ‘medieval’ tool that had been ‘used by monarchs to circumvent Parliament’. She told the Protecting the Media conference in London this week she was opposed to any form of state involvement in regulating the Press. She cited the detention of David Miranda, the partner  of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, who was detained for nine hours at Heathrow  last month on his way from Berlin to Rio de Janeiro carrying hard disks and memory sticks including secret files leaked by ex-CIA analyst Edward Snowden. Claims that News of the World (former editor Rebekah Brooks pictured) hacked the voicemail of murdered schoolgirl Millie Dowler were made by the Guardian in 2011 but thrown out . ‘If anything demonstrates why we do not want a government regulating the Press, David Miranda is that,’ she said. ‘We live in a democratic state and they still did what they did to David Miranda for no good reason at all. It goes back to the whole debate about why we shouldn’t have the state regulating the Press.’ She also voiced concerns about one of Leveson’s key proposals – the setting  up of a free arbitration service to decide damages claims against publishers. Under the Government-backed charter, the industry is obliged to set up the service that many local and regional papers fear is wide open to exploitation by ambulance-chasing lawyers. She told the conference: ‘We are creating a charter for people with dodgy claims. People will be tempted to go and try to get some money.’","Gill Phillips claims report has left 'all sides dissatisfied'

Georgina Wilkin ended up in hospital with anorexia after being told she could hit it big if she lost inches from her hips . A former model for A-list designers has told how she ended up in hospital with anorexia after being told she could be the next big thing if she ‘lost a few inches’ off her hips. Georgina Wilkin was an impressionable teenager when an agent made the remarks. Months later, as she began to fall prey to anorexia, she was congratulated on her appearance after starving herself for 48 hours. She was told that whatever she was doing to lose weight, she should ‘keep it up’. Once a familiar face on catwalks, Georgina Wilkin turned her back on the fashion industry five years ago after her eating disorder put her in hospital. Miss Wilkin, 23, described how she was spotted aged just 15. She added: ‘When I first saw my agent he said “Georgina, you have so much potential to be amazing. There are just a few things you need to be aware of if you want to be a success – just a few inches off your hips, tighten up your waist and join a gym”. ‘Seems reasonable, right? But when you are a 15-year-old girl with dreams of hitting the big time these words don’t just slide off your back.’ Six months later, Miss Wilkin claimed she was already struggling with anorexia while modelling in Japan. ‘I am sitting on the floor of my apartment and I still don’t know where the supermarket is,’ she said. ‘I was given a working contract on the condition that on my flight date back I measured 24, 22, 34 at the bust, waist and hips. 'The week before I left, an agent beamed and said to me “Georgina, whatever you are doing, keep doing it” – I had not eaten for nearly 48 hours.’ Miss Wilkin said she was congratulated on her appearance after starving herself for 48 hours . She gave up modelling five years ago after she ended up in hospital . Miss Wilkin, who modelled for Prada and other top designers, said that in the end agents did not want to risk their reputation by hiring her and considered her ‘a damaged product’. Now a personal assistant in London, she added: ‘It was not fair to tell a 15-year-old she has hippo hips and pass that off as constructive career advice. 'It is not right to excuse starvation under a promise of fame and fortune.’ She said her agent did sit her down and tell her she needed help when she became severely ill. But she added: ‘They did not want to put my card out there as it would reflect badly on them. A model is a product and an agent is only interested in selling that product until you get to a point where you have blue lips.’ She modelled for three years after being spotted by agency IMG London at a lecture on photographer Mario Testino. Miss Wilkin, who has overcome her anorexia, supports body image charity Beat. Susan Ringwood of Beat said: ‘Fashion does not cause eating disorders but fashion can be toxic. We want the industry to embrace diversity.’ Miss Wilkin spoke at The Shape of Fashion debate in London on Wednesday hosted by online fashion retailer Asos.","Georgina Wilkin congratulated on appearance after starving for 48 hours .

Jailed: Jennifer Philp-Parsons was jailed for two-and-a-half years after sleeping with two teenage boys . A married music teacher had alcohol-fuelled sex sessions with two boys from her school. Jennifer Philp-Parsons, a mother-of-three, invited the 16-year-olds to parties at her house, where she plied them with drinks. The 45-year-old had sex with one boy in the living room while her husband slept upstairs. On another occasion she slept  with two different boys in the space of one hour while her spouse was away. Police believe she may have seduced other pupils and Judge Francis Gilbert QC told Exeter Crown Court the teacher was ‘sordid and adulterous’. He told her she had committed ‘very serious offences involving seducing two of the students in your school in your own home for your own sexual gratification’. The judge added: ‘On the first occasion you plied them with drink when your husband was upstairs. ‘On the second you had sexual intercourse with both boys in a short space  of time … You have left a trail of destruction and significant distress for a number of people.’ The court heard how Philp-Parsons, who was head of music at a school in Devon, became the 16-year-olds’ favourite teacher, befriending them during lessons. After gaining their trust she hosted parties at her home in Exmouth, where she would provide her pupils with alcohol. It was during one of these house parties that she first had sex with a pupil. Hearing: The former head of music at a Devon college was sentenced at Exeter Crown Court, pictured . Emily Pitts, prosecuting, told the court: ‘The boy was alone with the defendant while he was watching a film on her sofa bed. ‘She . pulled up his T-shirt and stroked his stomach while commenting on his . physique. She touched him and she removed his clothing, they began . kissing and they had sexual intercourse.’ At . another party at her home just weeks later, ‘drinking games took place . and towards the end of the evening three boys were in the defendant’s . bedroom’, Miss Pitts added. ‘Two boys left leaving [the original victim] . alone with the defendant...  and they had sexual intercourse.’ The . court heard that less than an hour later, when the victim and a friend . left to buy food at around 1am, Philp-Parsons began to seduce a second . boy. After performing a sex . act on him she took him upstairs and slept with him. Miss Pitts said of . the second victim: ‘He felt pressured because it was her house and he . did not want to do it, but did not know what else to do.’ Philp-Parsons was arrested at the school after a member of the public reported rumours to the police. She initially denied the charges but confessed during a second interview. The . court was told that she refused to recognise the gravity of her . situation even after her arrest and continued to send text messages to . one of the 16-year-olds. One read: ‘Hi darling, I have missed you lots.’ Another said: ‘Please forgive me.’ Inappropriate: Philp-Parsons took one pupil for a meal at McDonald's in Exeter High Street, pictured . 'Sordid adulterous': Philp-Parsons also took a boy for food at Costa coffee in Princesshay Square in Exeter, pictured . Defending . the teacher, Richard Crabb said: ‘She was experiencing difficulties in . her marriage, she felt lonely and isolated at home. ‘She began to look for friendship and support from her students which was a foolish and dangerous thing to do.’ Mr Crabb added: ‘She knows it was wrong and she utterly regrets what she did at the parties.’ One . of the boys’ families said they had been left ‘heartbroken, utterly . shocked and disgusted by her lust and sexual needs’ and said it ‘was . every parent’s worst nightmare’. The other victim’s family said they had . been left ‘sick, devastated and destroyed by her selfish and perverted . needs’. Philp-Parsons admitted three counts of sexual activity with males aged between 13 and 17 while in a position of trust. Her husband of 18 years was in court yesterday as she was sentenced to 30 months in jail.

Almost 130,000 children left primary school this year without basic skills in reading, writing and arithmetic, official figures show. Only 76 per cent of 11-year-olds demonstrated a good understanding of the core subjects in standard attainment tests (SATs). Although a one per cent improvement on the previous year, it means 129,000 still went to secondary school with significant gaps in their education. Girls are outperforming boys in reading, writing and maths, it was revealed yesterday . The Government said most children were doing well by achieving a Level 4 pass in the three Rs but admitted too many were failing to reach the benchmark. Just 63 per cent managed a higher ‘good’ Level 4 in the subjects. It is the first time details of this category have been published. Almost 540,000 11-year-olds took the national curriculum tests in 2012/13, the Department for Education said. Reading, writing and maths tests took place over the school year and were combined to produce an overall score. Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said children should be congratulated for their achievements, but that the new test encourages schools to focus on these basics . The proportion of children who reached the expected standard in reading dropped from 87 per cent to 86 per cent. And only 45 per cent managed a top Level 5, a fall of three per cent. But those achieving expected standards in writing rose from 81 per cent to 83 per cent and in maths from 84 per cent to 85 per cent. Just over a quarter of children also failed to reach the desired level in a new spelling, punctuation and grammar test that was introduced this year. This rose to almost a third of boys – 31 per cent or 85,000 pupils – compared to 21 per cent of girls or 55,000 pupils. 76 per cent of pupils achieved Level 4 in reading, writing and maths, increased from 75 per cent in 2012 . 63 per cent achieved a 'good' Level 4 in the three disciplines . The number of pupils gaining Level 4 in reading dropped one per cent to 86 per cent . Level 5 scores dropped from 48 to 45 per cent . In maths, 85 per cent of pupils gained Level 4 – up one percentage point . Level 5 scores were up by two percentage points to 41 per cent . Level 4 writing results were up two percentage points to 83 per cent. The test includes sections where children insert missing full stops and capital letters, choose the correct preposition for a sentence or spell words including ‘substantial’  and ‘physically’. Pupil progress measures – which look at children’s development . between the ages of seven and 11 – were also released and showed . improvements in writing and maths but weaker performance in reading. Education minister Elizabeth Truss said the figures showed the majority of children were performing well. But . she added: ‘The statistics also reveal one in four children is leaving . primary school without a firm grasp of spelling, punctuation or grammar. ‘The new test encourages schools to focus on these basics.’ Neil .

Neices Houston, of Lubbock, TX., has been banned from classes at Seagraves Junior High School because her mother bleached her hair as a reward for her getting good grades. School administrators insist her bleached her is against school dress code. The dress code is enforced to prepare students for ‘the business world,’ the administrator told a local television station. I earned it: Neices Houston said she earned her dyed hair through getting good grades . Despite being a straight-A student, Neices Houston has been banned from classes until she changes her hair back. ‘She gets up this morning, gets ready to go to school; she's not allowed to go to her class again,’ her mother told KCBD. The honors student faces being placed in in-school suspension if her hair is not changed, the mother added. ‘Hair coloring or bleaching for the purpose of creating extreme differences in color,’ is deemed inappropriate grooming in the school’s student handbook, according to the station. A school administrator defended removing the otherwise model student from class because of her hair. ‘Any color or bleach that creates two different colors that are extreme, opposite of the natural color, then that is violation of dress code,’ Superintendent Dr. Kevin Spiller told the station. Heartbroken: A dejected Ms Houston looks down while her mother explains what threats the school has made . Despite the girl not being allowed in class and her mother telling KCBD her daughter has been threatened with in-school suspension, Mr Spiller told the station no disciplinary action had been taken – because of her hair. Neices Houston refuted the uncompromising Mr Spiller’s claim. ‘You can't go to your normal classes until you get your hair changed and if you don't get it changed by a certain date then you're gonna be put in ISS,’ the upset girl told the station her principal said. ‘If it's still not changed by then, then we're either going to suspend you or go from there,’ Neices Houston further claimed she was told. Not hurting anyone: The two women refuse to change the hair back and vow to fight the school on the policy . Mr Spiller also explained that students are normally given a timeline to resolve any violations, but both mother and daughter refuse to budge. ‘It's not hurting anybody but it's killing her not to be able to walk into a classroom and get her work done because in the long run she's gonna be behind…because of her hair?’ Watasha Houston asked. ‘I've waited two years to dye my hair and I've had to earn it by my grades,’ Neices Houston added.

Cameron's new law has been branded a flop after fewer than half of convicted knife thugs have been sent to prison . A law brought in by David Cameron to jail knife thugs was exposed as a flop yesterday after fewer than half of those convicted were sent to prison. Critics say the supposedly tough new crime of ‘aggravated’ knife possession is simply being ignored by the courts. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling last night promised to hold talks with senior judges about whether further guidance was needed to ensure serious knife offenders were sent to prison. Two years ago, the Prime Minister announced that courts would be forced to put knife thugs in jail for between six months and four years if they threatened the public. Mr Cameron said: ‘Far too many people still think they can go out armed with a knife. We need to send the clearest possible message that this simply has to change.’ The move was an attempt to mollify campaigners furious at the ditching of a Tory manifesto pledge to jail anyone caught carrying a knife. That policy was ruled out as too costly because it would have meant jailing up to 8,000 people. The less stringent offence of aggravated knife possession – which applies to those carrying knives who behave threateningly – came into force on December 3 last year. But figures released by the Ministry of . Justice yesterday show that in the first six months of this year, 63 . people were found guilty of the offence, of whom just 27 were sent to . jail. Critics say the supposedly tough new crime of 'aggravated' knife possession is simply being ignored by the courts (file pic) Eight received a suspended sentence, 17 were given community punishments, four were let off with a caution and seven have been convicted but not yet sentenced because they are being tried for other offences. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling last night promised to hold talks with senior judges about whether further guidance was needed to ensure serious knife offenders were sent to prison . Last night, Mr Grayling said he was disappointed that so few knife offenders had been sent to jail, adding: ‘I am clear people convicted of aggravated knife possession should be going to prison. ‘Whilst sentencing in individual cases is a matter for the courts I will consider with the senior judiciary whether any further guidance may be necessary.’ A breakdown of the figures shows that 12 of those convicted of threatening someone with a knife were aged ten to 15. Two of these were locked up, eight were given community sentences and two received a reprimand. A further ten were aged 16 and 17, six of whom were sentenced to immediate custody and the remainder given a community sentence. Forty-one of those convicted were adults, of whom 19 went to jail, eight received a suspended sentence, five a community sentence and two a caution. Seven are due to be sentenced at a later date. Labour justice spokesman Sadiq Khan said: ‘David Cameron was very clear before the election that anyone caught in possession of a knife would face a prison sentence. ‘He needs to explain to the people who voted for him on the back of this explicit promise why it has been broken.’","David Cameron's vow to lock up knife-wielding thugs branded a flop after half of those convicted were sent to prison .

A California associate pastor has been accused of sexually assaulting several of his parishioners with his ‘healing hands.’ Juan Jorge Castro, 53, of Norwalk, CA., was arrested last Friday for the alleged assault of at least four parishioners, but is suspected of violating upwards of 20. The allegations include repeated abuse of the victims and accusations he used their undocumented immigration status against them. Mr Castro has been formally charged for assaulting only four women, as the other 16 have refused to discuss the crimes with investigators. Accused pervert: Jorge Juan Castro, 53, is suspected of sexually assaulting at least 20 women in his parish . The alleged pervert is said by investigators to have told women who came to him for counseling that the sex acts were part of the faith-healing process,’ a Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson told local media. ‘He claimed to have healing hands and utilized that process to eventually sexually assault them,’ the spokesperson told the Los Angeles Times. ‘[Mr Castro] would perform certain acts with them in the name of God,’ a spokesperson told KCALAged 18 to 39, Mr Castro’s victims were all undocumented immigrants, which the accused man used to blackmail them into silence. ‘He did this by invoking fear by threatening to tell the victims if they reported him he would have the victims deported,’ a sheriff’s office spokesperson told KNX. House of evil: Mr Castro is accused of assaulting women both at this church, and at their homes . The allegedly corrupt counselor also threatened to embarrass his victims in front of the congregation. ‘He preyed upon them from a trust position. He warned them they'd be the subject of ridicule in the church if they told others,’ the spokesperson told the Times. The crimes are alleged to have taken place beginning in 2004, shortly after Mr Castro moved to Los Angeles from Argentina, according to reports.. They took place both on church grounds and in victims’ homes. Excommunicated: Mr Castro has been removed from the church as a result of his alleged actions . Investigators are promising any women wishing to come forward that they will overlook the victims’ immigration status and take no adverse action against them if they come forward, they told local media. Officials also believe there may be more victims and are urging all women victimized by Mr Castro to come forward and tell their story. The supposed scoundrel has been charged with multiple counts of rape, penetration by foreign object and oral copulation, but investigators told local media they expect more charges to come. He is being held in Los Angeles County jail on $2million bail.","Juan Jorge Castro, 53, has been formally charged with sexually assaulting four women .

One of the world’s richest men is comparing the Federal Reserve to a hedge fund, and heaping praise on a policy seen as misguided by some. Warren Buffet, 82, made the comparison Thursday during an interview at Georgetown University, in Washington, D.C., while discussing the central bank’s quantitative easing policy – but another billionaire criticized the program, calling it a reverse-redistribution of wealth. Quantitative easing saw the US government purchasing over $1.3trillion in securities at a clip of as much as $85billion per month.  The policy was enacted at the height of the recession to save the financial markets from total collapse. Best ever: Billionaire investor Warren Buffet called the Federal Reserve 'the world's greatest hedge fun' during an appearance Thursday at Georgetown University, in Washington, DCraska, USA --- Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett attends his company's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, in this April 30, 2011 file photo. REUTERS/Rick Wilking/Files (UNITED STATES - Tags: BUSINESS) --- Image by © RICK WILKING/Reuters/Corbis . Despite more than tripling the Fed’s balance sheet to over $3.6trillion, the US monetary authority has received praise for its market intervention. ‘The Fed is the greatest hedge fund in history,’ said Mr Buffet. The ‘Oracle of Omaha’ made the comparison only one day after the Fed made public plans to push back the long wind-down of the program, said the Telegraph. The policy has stabilized financial markets to the point they are reaching highs never before seen, even setting closing records several times in recent months. The billionaire also said he would reappoint current Fed chairman Ben Bernanke to a second term, if it were up to him, the Telegraph reported. ‘Since the panic of five years ago, he's done a terrific job,’ Buffet said, adding when asked if he would reappoint the former Princeton University professor ‘that’s what I would do.’ Keep him!: Buffet also advocated for the reappointment of Fed chair Ben Bernanke at the end of his current term . Mr Buffet, head of Berkshire Hathaway, did warn that the government’s eventual exit from the securities business may not be as easy as its entry. ‘We are in an experiment which hasn't really been tried before,’ he said, according to the Telegraph, ‘buying securities is usually easier than selling securities.’ The Fed’s quantitative easing purchases have been a combination of Federal Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Not so fast: Fellow billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller, founder of Duquesne Capital, called quantitative easing 'the biggest redistribution of wealth from the middle class and the poor to the rich ever' The program was widely expected to end no later than early summer, causing investor jitters earlier this year. As the program has dragged on, the market has continued to rise – a development one billionaire bragged about Thursday morning on CNBC. ‘This is fantastic for every rich person,’ said hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller. ‘This is the biggest redistribution of wealth from the middle class and the poor to the rich ever.’ Mr Druckenmiller, founder of Duquesne Capital, blasted the program, saying the only people benefitting from it are the rich. ‘I mean, maybe this trickle-down monetary policy that gives money to billionaires and hopefully we go spend it is going to work,’ he said during the network’s Squawk Box program, ‘but it hasn't worked for five years.’","Warren Buffet made the comments Thursday at Georgetown University .

Tom DeLay says he has God to thank for his acquittal on charges he laundered money for the Republican Party. The disgraced politician turned Dancing With the Stars alum said he was on his knees in prayer Thursday when he learned his conviction on charges he funneled corporate money to Republican candidates had been overturned. The Texas 3rd Court of Appeals deemed the evidence ‘legally insufficient’ and reversed a jury’s 2010 decision to convict. First of all, I'd like to thank God: Disgraced former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay thanks God for his overturned money laundering conviction . While lunching in the Capitol with prominent religious conservatives, the 66-year-old Texan said his lawyer called with the news. 'We were all basically on our knees praying and our lawyer calls and says, ""You're a free man,""' he said. 'This was an outrageous criminalization of politics and I'm so glad that they wrote the ruling that they did.' The attorney, Brian Wice, said DeLay felt validated by Thursday’s ruling. ‘He’s ecstatic. He’s gratified. He’s just a little bit numb,’ Wice said. ‘I’m hoping with today’s victory, he will be able to resume his life as he once knew it.’ DeLay was found guilty of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering for helping illegally funnel corporate money to Texas candidates in 2002. He was sentenced to three years in prison, but his sentence was on hold while his case made its way through the appellate process. Wice was thrilled, as well. If the trench coat don't fit: DeLay is seen leaving an Austin, Texas jail after posting an appeals bond in 2011. On Thursday, his 2010 conviction was thrown out by a Texas appeals court that called the evidence 'legally insufficient' According to the American-Statesman, the lawyer said he told his client: ‘When I see you, I’m going to dump a Gatorade bucket over your head. We won the Super Bowl.’ Wice said the state could appeal to the Texas Criminal Court of Appeals, the state’s highest criminal court. Wice said he was confident DeLay would win again if necessary. Meanhile, Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg promised, 'We are absolutely going to appeal.' Star turn: Here, DeLay smiles as he leaves a lunch meeting on Capitol Hill, Thursday. Since his 2010 conviction, one of the former Congressman's more notable turns in the spotlight came with a 2009 appearance on Dancing with the Stars . A jury in Austin had determined that DeLay conspired with two associates, John Colyandro and Jim Ellis, to use his Texas-based political action committee to send a check for $190,000 in corporate money to an arm of the Washington-based Republican National Committee. The RNC then sent the same amount to seven Texas House candidates. Under state law, corporate money cannot be given directly to political campaigns. Prosecutors said the money helped the GOP take control of the Texas House, enabling them to push through a DeLay-engineered congressional redistricting plan that sent more Republicans to Congress in 2004, strengthening his political power. But in a 22-page opinion, the appeals court said prosecutors “failed in its burden to prove that the funds that were delivered to the seven candidates were ever tainted.”Gregg Cox, the Travis County prosecutor whose office convicted DeLay, did not immediately return a phone message Thursday.","The former U.S. House Majority Leader was convicted of funneling money from corporations to Texas candidates in 2002 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:57 EST, 19 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:43 EST, 19 September 2013 . The vast scale of Britain’s retirement rip-off was exposed yesterday after it emerged that workers are being deprived of £43million a year from their pension pots. Hidden annual fees are eating away at the savings of nearly 1.5million of those with old company retirement schemes. Higher charges for workers with cash in policies created before 2001 is leaving them far worse off than those in newer schemes – losing up to 40 per cent of their life savings in the worst cases. Losing out: Many workers are not getting value for money on their pension schemes, the Office of Fair Trading has found . But despite the extent of the . retirement scandal exposed by the Office of Fair Trading, the watchdog . has refused to cap charges – and instead told insurers they should put . their own house in order. It . had been hoped the OFT would demand a management fee ceiling of 1 per . cent per year on all company pension funds. However, even this would . mean employees losing the equivalent of 20 per cent of their total . entitlement over the course of a working lifetime. Tom . McPhail, head of pensions research at financial services company . Hargreaves Lansdown, accused the OFT of pulling its punches. ‘It’s a . start, but the OFT didn’t go far enough and these measures are weak,’ he . said. ‘They had an opportunity to really improve the way these giant funds are run on behalf of savers, and didn’t take it. ‘A . cap on charges would have been achievable for the industry, but they’ve . ignored it and asked insurers to sort it all themselves. ‘To be honest, it’s like putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop.’ The . OFT investigation looked into the £275billion of savings held by five . million people in company pensions which are invested in the stock . market – known as defined contribution schemes. Unlike . traditional final salary pensions, these are schemes in which employees . build up a personal pension pot of cash over their working lifetime, . which may then be used to buy an annuity to provide income in . retirement. Changes: Because of dropping numbers having private pensions, workers are to be auto-enrolled into schemes . The OFT . launched its probe because up to nine million more workers are being . enrolled in such pensions over the next five years, in line with the . Government’s ‘auto-enrolment’ plan to plug the private savings gap. Its . report found that the average annual management charge for newer . pension schemes was 0.62 per cent compared to 0.78 per cent for older . schemes – those taken out before 2001 when the Government legislated to . cut annual pension charges to help savers get better returns. 'Need for clarity': Pensions expert Ros Altmann says the current array of cost measures are confusing . Although these fees will seem small, their impact over decades of saving is deadly. A 0.5 per cent charge built up over an employee’s working life can slash a potential pension pot by around 11 per cent. A . 1 per cent fee can reduce retirement savings by around 20 per cent, but . the highest annual charge the OFT discovered – a punitive 2.3 per cent – . would slash a worker’s savings by 40 per cent. The . high fees are typically levied to cover the cost of running the fund, . such as paying for legal costs, software, administration and investment . transactions. Following its investigation, the OFT called for much greater transparency on charges. It . found as many as 18 different names for a pension charge, which it said . would baffle ordinary savers. The competition watchdog has ordered the . Association of British Insurers (ABI) to investigate these older schemes . and introduce a new, easy-to-understand charge – in pounds and pence – . for savers each year. However, it will not have to do so until December . 2015. New independent committees will also be set up in order to ensure savers get better value for money.It . recommends the Government consults on ways to improve the transparency . of costs and the quality of schemes in order to make it easier for . companies to pick pensions for their staff. In . its report, the OFT dismissed calls for a cap on the grounds that it . could distort the market by encouraging companies to make back lost . revenues elsewhere. From the beginning: how The Mail has covered the story in the past . Clive . Maxwell, chief executive of the OFT, said: ‘We believe these measures . are an important step in helping to ensure that savers get better . outcomes. ‘Given that automatic enrolment is already under way, it’s important they are implemented rapidly.’ Steve . Webb, Minister for Pensions, said: ‘We need to ensure those already in . pension schemes are getting good value for money, and will be actively . involved in the audit of pension schemes sold prior to 2001.’ The . watchdog also urged the Government to ban the practice of levying . higher charges to individuals who leave a pension scheme – when taking a . job at a different company, for example – but leave their savings . behind. They pay a higher annual fee compared to workers who continue with their monthly contributions. Consulting: Pensions minister Steve Webb has signalled the Government will investigate whether charges should be capped for auto-enrolment schemes. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has carried out a probe to make sure enough competition is being injected into the pensions market to benefit millions of new savers who are being brought into defined contribution schemes. What are defined contribution (DC) pension schemes? These are pension schemes where the amount of cash you are putting in is specified but the benefits you will reap when you retire are less clear. As well as the amount of contributions, the eventual size of the retirement income you will get with your savings pot depends on factors such as the performance of investments in the scheme as well as annuity rates. People buy an annuity when they retire and the rate they get sets the annual income they will receive for the rest of their life. There are several different types of annuity, depending on factors such as the state of your health and whether you want them to provide an income for just yourself or your spouse as well. Annuity rates can vary widely and shopping around to buy one could add hundreds of pounds to your yearly pension income. These rates have been in general decline in recent years as people live longer. Pensions experts have also put the drops down to side-effects of the Bank of England's efforts to kick-start the economy. Why is the OFT looking into these schemes? This type of scheme is seeing the biggest area of growth in the pensions market as the Government rolls out its landmark reforms to tackle concerns that people are not saving enough for their old age. More than one million workers have started saving into pensions as a result of automatic enrolment, which started last autumn with larger firms. Up to eight million more employees are eventually expected to start saving into a workplace pension scheme as a result of automatic enrolment and the vast majority will be saving into DC schemes. DC schemes have largely replaced pensions which give people a guaranteed retirement income such as 'final salary' schemes in recent years as firms have found these expensive to run. Report: The OFT has revealed its findings from a probe into the defined contributions pensions industry that involves millions . What issues with the market has the OFT previously raised concerns about? In its interim findings in July, the OFT flagged several aspects of the market which could hold back people's ability to get a good retirement income. Pension charges were found to be hard to compare in some cases because providers did not present them consistently. The OFT said it was also worried that several schemes may 'not have a realistic prospect' of growing large enough to generate value for those enrolled into them. It also raised concerns over schemes which have 'two-tier' charging structures, whereby people who have stopped making contributions into a particular pension pot, perhaps because they have changed jobs, end up paying higher annual management charges. What have the industry and Government been doing to make it easier for pension savers to get a good deal? The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has started publishing more tailored information on its website to help people choose the right annuity deal. The ABI now publishes 'specimen' annuity rates offered by its members, based on 12 examples reflecting different customer circumstances. The Government has also recently banned employers from offloading the costs of financial advice given to them to help them choose and manage a pension scheme on to their employees, in the form of extra 'consultancy' charges on workers' pension pots. Concerns had been raised that workers' pension savings could be eaten up by employers imposing such charges. What measures are open to the OFT when it carries out market studies? Options range from giving the market a clean bill of health to making recommendations to bodies such as the Government or making a referral to the Competition Commission. The OFT recently referred the payday lending industry for an in-depth investigation by the Commission as it felt the problems in the market were 'deep-rooted'.","Office of Fair Trading announced findings from its pension probe today .

Disgraced: Bullying former MSP Bill Walker pictured arriving at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today repeatedly blamed his wives, the media and anyone he could think of for his own appalling behaviour . Disgraced former MSP Bill Walker has been jailed for 12 months for a string of attacks against his three former wives and a stepdaughter that spanned decades. Walker, of Alloa in Clackmannanshire, was convicted of 23 charges of domestic abuse and one breach of the peace last month after a two-week trial. The 71-year-old, who clung to his Dunfermline seat for 16 days after the verdict, returned to Edinburgh Sheriff Court today where he was sentenced by Sheriff Kathrine Mackie. Sheriff Mackie found Walker guilty of assaulting his first wife Maureen Traquair on three separate occasions in the 1960s and 1980s. On one occasion he assaulted her two weeks before their wedding in January 1967 punching her in the face and leaving her with a black eye. Ms Traquair told the court she even had to buy concealer to hide the bruises from their family and friends on the couple’s wedding day. Walker was also convicted of assaulting his second wife, Anne Gruber, 15 times between 1978 and 1984. The court heard that on various occasions Mrs Gruber was punched, slapped, kicked and pushed to the ground. In an astonishing catalogue of abuse Walker spat on her face, threw household items at her, threatened to pour hot coffee over her and pulled her hair. He also breached the peace by leaping into Mrs Gruber’s home brandishing an air rifle after she went out for a birthday meal with another man. Walker was also found guilty of assaulting and injuring Mrs Gruber’s 16-year-old daughter, Anne Louise Paterson, by repeatedly striking her on the head with a saucepan in 1978 until she was left . Mrs Gruber told the court: 'He turned on her and whacked her repeatedly over the head with a yellow saucepan that was so badly broken up it was put in the bin. 'He battered her so hard she was down on the floor. Her head was bleeding and she was bruised.' The disgraced politician was found guilty of four assaults on his third wife Diana Walker, three of which involved slapping or punching her on the face. The attacks on her happened between June 1988 and January 1995. She told the court her husband also recorded her phone calls and made her sign an agreement to do all household chores in their home. Walker’s crimes were committed at addresses in Edinburgh, Stirling, Midlothian and Alloa between 1967 and 1995. Diana Walker told the court she spoke to journalists about her ex-husband after she felt 'mad' to hear that he was supporting a women’s aid project for victims of domestic abuse. The former SNP MSP, who was suspended and later expelled from the party after the allegations surfaced in the Sunday Herald newspaper in March last year, denied all the charges. Remarkably he maintained that he had acted in self-defence in relation to all three of them. Giving evidence, Walker claimed he was the victim of 'smearing' and that his ex-wives colluded to accuse him of domestic violence. Bullying: Walker with former wife Anne Gruber, the court found him guilty of assaulting her 15 times between 1978 and 1984, Walker claimed he acted in self-defence . But Sheriff Mackie said Walker was not a credible witness and the evidence shows he was 'controlling, domineering, demeaning and belittling' towards all his former wives. She told him: 'Your . incredulity at being convicted of these offences and your perceived . victimisation are further indications of your abdication of . responsibility for your behaviour. 'You . have shown what can only be described as contempt for your former wives . and your step daughter in the derogatory manner in which you refer to . them. 'I formed the opinion that you have no understanding of the impact of domestic abuse on victims or children. 'I . have been unable to detect, either during the trial or in the reports, . any evidence of remorse for anything or anyone except yourself.' She added that given his 'extreme . denial' of his behaviour, it was unrealistic to expect Walker to engage . fully with any non-custodial domestic abuse programme. Sheriff Mackie  also said it was clear from their evidence that to Walker’s former wives, his behaviour remained 'vivid and distressing.' She added: 'Having . regard to the gravity of these offences as a result of the cumulative . effect of them, your extreme denial and complete absence of any remorse, . and the assessment of risk, I have come to the conclusion that a . custodial sentence is the only appropriate disposal. Mrs Gruber was kicked, punched, slapped and pushed to the ground by her former husband who also once confronted her with an air rifle and viciously her daughter with a saucepan . 'In . my opinion, the repeated abuse and violent behaviour towards your three . former wives and stepdaughter over a period of 28 years outweighs other . factors.' She added: 'I formed the . impression that in the few incidents where you acknowledged the use of . physical force, you believed you were entitled to or justified in its . use, and certainly have made no apology for it. 'Your . denial appears to me to be absolute. There is no acknowledgement of any . unacceptable behaviour, there is no indication of any motivation to . change. 'The conclusion that . there’s a significant scope to work with you to address your entrenched . attitudes, value and beliefs surrounding domestic abuse is flawed.” Walker initially refused to vacate his Holyrood seat after the verdict, despite pressure from campaigners and other MSPs, the vast majority of whom signed a motion calling for him to step down. He faced having his salary cut by 90% if jailed, after the parliament’s corporate body recommended the move for MSPs who go to prison. The politician finally resigned on September 7, blaming a 'media onslaught' that made it impossible for him to continue. Walker was elected to the Scottish Parliament in a surprise victory for the SNP two years ago. The by-election to fill his Dunfermline seat will be held on Thursday October 24.","Bill Walker, 71, has been jailed for a year for a catalogue of abuse doled out over four decades .

A cobbled path leading to one of the world’s best-preserved medieval streets is being ripped up and replaced with modern paving after a council said the surface was a hazard to disabled people. King’s Square, in an ancient part of York, will be entirely repaved in a scheme that is costing taxpayers almost £500,000 and goes against the advice of English Heritage. City of York Council said the rectangular cobbles - or setts - and other period stonework should be replaced as they 'cause mobility problems for some people.' A cobbled path leading to the Shambles, one world's best preserved medieval streets, is being ripped up in York as part of a £500,000 re-development . The cobblestone streets of the city are a major tourist attraction and . widely regarded as one of the best preserved medieval areas in the world . Centuries-old human remains from a former churchyard may also have to be removed so the new paving can be laid. Conservation experts at English Heritage warned that the existing stonework is an important historic feature of the square, which is lined by timber-framed medieval buildings and other listed structures. They urged the council not to remove any of the period features, which include old York stone paving worn smooth by generations of feet in the centre of the square and granite wagon tracks that meanders along one side and into the Shambles- widely regarded as one of the best-preserved medieval roads in the world and named Britain’s most picturesque street. English Heritage emphatically recommended that all existing stonework was kept and restored for sake of preserving the area. A spokesman said: 'The square is an important part of York’s Conservation Area and the setting of numerous listed buildings. 'In terms of the paving in the area, we gave our view that we would wish to see the retention of all the present York stone and stone cobbled surfaces, along with the granite wheel tracks and kerbstones.' However it seems their pleas for preservation have fallen on deaf ears as the council plows on with modernisation the period stonework would be replaced with new paving because it could be a hazard. Lost: Despite an English Heritage recommendation that all existing stonework was kept and restored, the 75 foot cobbled path and other period stonework is being ripped up and replaced with modern paving . Aptly named: The cash-strapped council - which recently announced more than 200 job cuts and a 1.9% increase in council tax - said the work will cost £490,000 . A council officer said in a consultation document: 'It is proposed that nearly all of the surfacing of King’s Square will be replaced. 'In this instance it is not practical to extensively re-use existing worn and damaged material, particularly where this surface causes mobility problems for some users.' The work is being carried out as part of a 'revamp' of King’s Square, which City of York Council said needed a 'radical rethink' in order to make it a 'world-class space.' When it is paved over it will be used by street performers and, subject to planning permission, could also be used by alfresco diners completely changing the tone of the historic quarter of the city. The cash-strapped council - which recently announced more than 200 job cuts, big cuts to front-line services and a 1.9% increase in council tax - said the work will cost £490,000. But Councillor Dave Merrett, Cabinet Member for Planning, Sustainability and Transport, remains convinced they are doing the best for locals and tourists. He said: 'By transforming King’s Square we are maximising the benefits for residents, visitors and businesses. 'The square needs quite a radical rethink to make it a world-class space and by carrying out this transformation we are going to provide a much better quality public space.' However, one resident at least was less than impressed. Pictured, the start of the path that is due to be re-developed, the council says the rectangular cobbles known as setts pose an apparent 'mobility' issue . York is famous for its historic squares and its snickleways - tight alleys between crooked old buildings. Thousands of visitors flock to the city each year to see one of the best-preserved medieval streets in the world. The Shambles was named ‘Britain’s most picturesque street’ in the 2010 Google Street View Awards. King’s Square lies at one end of the . Shambles, which was a historic butchers’ quarter mentioned in the . Domesday Book and has changed little since around 1400. A chapel called Holy Trinity Christ . Church was at the heart of King’s Square until it was demolished in . 1937. Although is not clear when the current stonework in King’s Square dates from the earliest known mention of the church dates from 1268. The cobbled path, which was built in the . 20th century in a style typical of many York lanes, marks the old . roadway which is visible in photographs from the early 1900s. Kaitlyn Kernek, 31, said: 'People come from all over the world to see York because it looks like York. 'It’s mad to pull up things that give this beautiful city its character, only to replace them with modern paving that looks like anywhere else.' Campaign group the TaxPayers’ Alliance said the scheme was a waste of public money and should be scrapped. A spokesman said: 'Local residents are opposed to this work, as is English Heritage, and you do have to question if the council thinks residents serve them, rather than the other way around. 'The council should scrap this scheme, save taxpayers’ money and help preserve one of York’s historic squares.' Archeologists have already been called in after workmen carrying out the resurfacing uncovered the foundations of the Victorian and possibly the medieval church. They said some human remains may need to be moved so the area can be repaved. Several grave stones dating from the 1700s are currently used as paving slabs and they will be kept, the council added. English Heritage said the current layout dates from 1937 and much of the stonework itself is probably older, possibly re-used at the time. However, the council said the layout has changed several times throughout the last 100 years and the current layout is not historically significant enough to be preserved. Work has already begun on the King’s Square scheme and will take 12 weeks. The council plans a number of similar projects in other parts of the city centre as part of its Reinvigorate York programme. Earlier this year, a project to replace 18th century stone setts in the market square in the nearby town of Beverley with modern block paving was scrapped after uproar from residents, historians and English Heritage. East Riding of Yorkshire Council claimed the setts caused difficulties for disabled people but abandoned the plan just a couple of days before work was due to start in January.","The path leads to one of the best-preserved medieval streets in the world .

Forbidden fruit: unfortunately for those looking for a tasty way to stay healthy, these chocolate treats will not count as one of your five a day . Bounty of the land: The three fruit trees have sprouted in London's Old Spitafields Market and will be offering free tastings from 10am until 6pm tomorrow . The ingenious edible grove appeared this morning to help launch Green & Black's new range of organic orange and lemon chocolate. The funky fruit was created in partnership with Jacqui Kelly for Miss Cakehead and took 55 hours and 65 kilograms of chocolate to make. Visitors to the market are being invited to try free samples from the three chocolate trees from 10am until 6pm. New: The stunt has been put on ahead of the launch of Green and Black's new organic lemon and orange chocolate bars in October . Confusion: The mixed-up trees surprised commuters this morning as they seemed to have grown overnight . The two new 100g bars will be available from October. The orange flavour will be mixed with milk chocolate, and the lemon will be dark chocolate.

Police have stepped up patrols around Kathryn Blair's £1million home the barrister (pictured at her brother's wedding) was mugged at gunpoint . Police have stepped up patrols on the streets around the £1million home of Tony Blair’s daughter after she was mugged at gunpoint. Kathryn, a 25-year-old barrister, was confronted by two gunmen who demanded cash and jewellery as she walked her dog with her boyfriend. Taxpayers have spent millions on armed bodyguards for Mr Blair as he tours the world  giving speeches, pursuing his business interests and working as a peace envoy. And the home he shares with Cherie, which is close to Hyde Park, is protected around the clock by police marksmen. However unlike her father, Kathryn – who qualified as a  barrister last year – does not receive specialist protection. Scotland Yard said officers would now remain in the area around her west London home ‘for as long as they are needed’. The attempted robbery took place at about 8.30pm on Monday as Kathryn returned to the flat she shares with friends. She and her boyfriend were approached by two men, one wearing a bandana and holding a gun and the second covering his face with a scarf. They told the couple to hand over their valuables, but ran off when they saw some of Kathryn’s friends approaching. The mugging took place just metres from her home, which is secured by a reinforced door with three locks. Detectives believe the men were also responsible for a second mugging just half an hour earlier in a nearby street. Both crimes are being investigated by the most senior detectives in Westminster’s robbery and burglary squad. Detective Inspector Chris Rhodes said the crimes were being taken extremely seriously. ‘Fortunately none of the victims were injured and nothing was stolen,’ he said. ‘However, being confronted by an armed . man is deeply distressing. We are now appealing for the public’s help . to try and track down the man responsible and his accomplice. ‘If you were out and about around this area on Monday night and saw something then please get in touch.’ He added: ‘Detectives are in the process of tracking down CCTV from the surrounding area and our investigation is ongoing. ‘Extra patrols will be taking place in and around the area over the coming days.’ A spokesman for Tony Blair said: ‘Kathryn was with a group of friends. No one was hurt and nothing was stolen.’ Worried residents in the upmarket area said the crimes have left them too scared to leave their homes after dark. And some claimed that their local council had tried to stop them upgrading their security arrangements – to prevent their homes turning into ‘fortresses’. Kathryn, 25, pictured with her parents Tony and Cherie Blair, does not receive specialist protection . Marion Rowland, 68, said: ‘It is frightening to know that happened. I am going to take more care in future.’ Another resident said: ‘How terrifying for that poor girl – she must have been so scared when she saw the gun. ‘Some people will do anything for money. I’m living in fear, it’s scary to know people are carrying guns around here.’ She added: ‘I tried to get a strong gate for my door, but the council didn’t want “fortress London” outside our house.’ Taxpayers have spent millions on armed bodyguards for Blair (pictured at his son's wedding) Westminster borough commanders have now tasked officers with patrolling the streets around Kathryn’s home. Armed response teams, which constantly roam central London, have also been warned about the potential threat. One neighbour said: ‘I have seen police a few times today, but it’s been quite low key.’ Blair’s eldest son, Euan, who married Suzanne Ashman at the weekend, was mugged by a gang of youths in 2001 when he was 17. The teenager was left ‘shaken’ after the thugs told him to empty his pockets and tried to snatch a portable CD player as he was walking home one night.","Kathryn Blair, 25, does not receive specialist protection from taxpayer .

Tony Blair’s government, including ministers, advisers and even civil servants, became obsessed with trying to prevent the Labour Prime Minister from being ousted from power, leaked emails reveal. Number 10 aides became embroiled in a desperate and at times highly emotional scramble to shore up the Blair premiership in August 2006, as pressure mounted for him to set a date to leave. Ben Wegg-Prosser, former director of strategic communications, released the cache of emails as a warning to Ed Miliband of the dangers of in-fighting distracting from running the country. Battle: Tony Blair's aides, spin doctors and officials became embroiled in a frantic battle to prevent Gordon Brown ousting him from Number 10 during the summer of 2006 . The emails reveal how allies of Mr Blair were also desperate to prevent him from endorsing Gordon Brown as his successor when he finally quit in 2007. But in the summer of 2006, the Blair and Brown camps became embroiled in an all-consuming battle for power. It includes a scramble to get dozens of Labour MPs to sign a letter urging Mr Blair to stay in Downing Street. And Mr Blair's chief of staff suggesting their 'people' starting accusing Mr Brown of 'blackmail'. Desperation: The emails, released by former director of strategic communications Ben Wegg-Prosser (left), reveal Tony Blair's chief of staff Jonathan Powell urged MPs to accuse Gordon Brown of 'blackmail' The emails from inside the Blair bunker reveal the desperation of No.10 aides to see off calls for the PM to go in September 2006. Here is a selection, as reported in The Guardian: . Tuesday 5 September 2006 . 11.10am from head of policy Matthew Taylor: Can we continue to try to get MPs to ring each other? We won't be able to pretend this is spontaneous but we want it to be seen we are co-ordinating an MPs effort rather than driving it from here. 11.36am from assistant press secretary Razi Rahman:At 11.30am we have 17 names. 11.35am from Wegg-Prosser: [Karen] Buck is next port of call we need her up and about very quickly. Her phone [is] switched off and we are chasing her. If Buck does not come through in an hour we will need to identify another candidate to lead on this. Lunchtime news confused, but tone not good. 2.29pm from Rahman: Currently we have 34 names doc attacked . 5.31pm from Rahman: 5.30pm update 54 MPs signed up. List attached. 5.35pm from political secretary John McTernan: add Mary Creagh and Jim Sheridan. 5.36pm from Wegg-Prosser: Sheridan IS ON THEIR LETTER . 5.38pm from McTernan: I know a real unravelling, Anne Moffat [then MP for East Lothian] in Scotland persuaded Jim. 5.39pm from Rahman: now 57 MPs . Wednesday 6 September 2006 . 2.19pm from Blair chief of staff Jonathan Powell: TB thinks we need to plan a roll out of cabinet members in support around his statement. Can we co-ordinate this? And we need to get people to start using the expression blackmail as in we cannot have the party to give into the blackmail of a small number of MPs threatening continued instability while calling for stability.Friday 8 September 2006 . 1.29pm from Jonathan Pearse in the whips' office: Whips office have been doing a lot of ringing round today. Some concern amongst colleagues that CC [Charles Clarke] was put up by us so the message is anything we can do to stop now would be helpful to calming the situation down. Bob Ainsworth [MP] says it is also important that Alan Milburn and Stephen Byers don't say anything to stoke the fires as we will get the blame for that. 1.37pm from Wegg-Prosser: Umm this thing has ruined my weekend which admittedly was ruined some time ago thanks to half a dozen unknown student politicians who by accident became Labour MPs. 6.15pm from Wegg-Prosser to former Blair aide Anji Hunter: I am shattered. I did my best - taking orders from our friend in Brussels and my own instincts. Key points impossible to have proper negotiations cos every time they agreed something they leaked it to the papers. GB kept demanding TB's endorsement yet at the same time told that he had to leave office immediately cos the public hate him – weird or what. There was no shouting that was made up. First meeting in GB office the second on the patio. Releasing the emails, Mr Wegg-Prosser . warned: ‘The sheer emotional energy these scrapes consumed does not . reflect well on any of the participants – me included. ‘Everyone who participated in them, . from ministers, MPs, advisers and many more civil servants than is ever . acknowledged, should reflect on what else could have been achieved when . we weren't fighting.’ Just 15 months after winning a third . successive general election, Mr Blair came under mounting pressure to . announce when he would make way for Mr Brown. But the messages detail how Mr Blair's closest allies team tried to avoid setting a date for his departure. The emails cover August 21, 2006 to . September 8, 2006, and show how figures from Number 10 and Labour . attempt to deal with increasing pressure for clarity on Mr Blair's . future. Mr Wegg-Prosser released the emails to The Guardian to coincide with the Daily Mail’s publication of the explosive memoirs of former Brown spin doctor Damien McBride. Mr McBride was the former press secretary of Mr Brown and is referred to as ‘Damian McP****face"" by Mr Wegg-Prosser in the emails released. The emails reveal the frantic and often despairing attempts to find Labour MPs who would publicly back Mr Blair, and the tussles to draft statements and briefings for the media. Then-foreign secretary David Miliband and then-home secretary John Reid were muted as possible challengers to Mr Brown for the leadership. At one point  Liz Lloyd, then-deputy chief of staff at Number 10, on September 6 was asked about getting Mr Miliband to put his name forward. She replies: ‘I still cannot get up the courage to tell him his country needs him.’ Writing for the Guardian, Mr Wegg-Prosser said the manner of Mr Blair's departure still ‘casts a shadow’ over Labour. He said: ‘The “coup” of September 2006 was the culmination of 12 years of mutual frustration between the occupants of numbers 10 and 11 Downing Street. The constant ding-dongs served neither man well. ‘Looking back, the response from Team Blair to the letter-writing campaign to remove him from office was remarkably naive, coordinated through random email chains, conference calls and impromptu meetings. ‘It is now clear that Team Brown were effectively running a disciplined war-room with battle plans and an agreed sequence of attack. That it should have come to this is profoundly depressing. ‘It was also clear that Brown's team were convinced that the answer to every problem which Labour faced was that Blair should go. We, on the other hand, toyed with the idea of boosting other potential challengers to Brown. Curiously, whenever the issue was raised with the prime minister he was reluctant to engage.’ Mr Wegg-Prosser conceded: ‘The sheer emotional energy these scrapes consumed does not reflect well on any of the participants - me included. ‘Everyone who participated in them, from ministers, MPs, advisers and many more civil servants than is ever acknowledged, should reflect on what else could have been achieved if we weren't fighting."" Mr McBride has tweeted a response to the messages, referencing characters from US crime drama The Wire. He wrote: ‘I love the No.10 emails: I feel like (Jimmy) McNulty going through (Russell) Stringer Bell's apartment.’ Mr McBride added on his Twitter account: ‘I suppose the virtue of publishing old emails and diaries is it doesn't require any self-criticism from those whose egos prevent that.’","Emails reveal the scramble in No.10 to see off threat from Chancellor .

Senator John McCain is fighting words with words as he has written an editorial blasting Vladimir Putin in a Russian newspaper. The Republican politician's op-ed comes a week after Putin took to The New York Times in an effort to speak directly to the American people about the dangers of a military strike on Syria. Now McCain has written a scathing attack about how Putin's presidency is 'destroying' Russia's reputation and slams the leader for making decisions based not in the best interest of his people. Fighting words: John McCain has written an editorial blasting Russian President Vladimir Putin in one of his country's top newspapers . Damaging: McCain says that Putin (seen here with Syrian President Bashar al Assad in 2006) has damaged Russia's global reputation by making them 'a friend to tyrants and an enemy to the oppressed' 'He has made (Russia) a friend to tyrants and an enemy to the oppressed, and untrusted by nations that seek to build a safer, more peaceful and prosperous world,' McCain wrote in the Thursday edition of Russian newspaper Pravda, making a clear reference to Syrian President Bashar al Assad. News of the editorial was sent out via McCain's press team early Thursday morning. They said that McCain brought up the issue of inalienable rights which Americans are afforded under the U.S. Constitution, saying that Putin is threatened by the notion. 'President Putin doesn’t believe in these values because he doesn’t believe in you,' McCain wrote. 'He doesn’t believe that human nature at liberty can rise above its weaknesses and build just, peaceful, prosperous societies. Or, at least, he doesn’t believe Russians can. So he rules by using those weaknesses, by corruption, repression and violence.' Taking heat: Senator McCain was an early supporter of President Obama's call for missile strikes against Syria . Warmongering: Putin, seen meeting here on Wednesday with Mikhail Kalashnikov who created the AK-47 rifle, has been the most vocal supporter of Syria's President Bashar al Assad . McCain took pains to make it clear he was directing his criticism at Putin and not the country on the whole. 'When I criticize your government, it is not because I am anti-Russian. It is because I believe you deserve a government that believes in you and answers to you. And, I long for the day when you have it,' he wrote. The editorial does not come as a surprise as Pravda offered McCain the opportunity to have a rebuttal in their paper following Putin's piece in the New York Times. Though McCain and President Obama were rivals in the 2008 presidential race, the two have been together on their stande against Syria as McCain was one of ten members of the Senate Foreign Relations committee whocoted to allow the President to order a military strike against the country in response to their use of chemical weapons.","Comes a week after Putin wrote an editorial in the New York Times .

A two-year-old boy drowned after falling into his grandparents’ swimming pool. Edward ‘Teddie’ Rainger was last seen playing with his four-year-old brother next to the pool in his grandparents’ garden. Emergency services were called after he was found lying lifeless on the pool bottom in Langdon Hills, Essex. The little boy was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead shortly after arrival. Yesterday family members paid tribute to Teddie, who had been staying with his grandparents Mark and Deborah Rainger at their £600,000 detached home. His aunt Kirsty Rainger, 26, wrote a message on Facebook saying: ‘This is breaking our hearts … it’s a cruel world.’ She added: ‘My gorgeous brave Teddie. I can’t believe this has happened. ‘You will always be in my heart and not a second will go by where I don’t think of you and miss you. You’re such a clever funny boy. A little daredevil and a little fighter. Life itself will never be the same. You’ll be the brightest star shining down on your big brother, mummy and daddy. ‘This is so heartbreaking. Sleep tight and keep smiling, we know you’ll always be with us.’ His 22-year-old aunt Roxy Rainger also posted online, saying: ‘I just want him back.’ An inquest was formally opened at Chelmsford Coroners’ Court yesterday following the tragedy on Tuesday last week.

Most wanted: Martin John Power, 46, is sought by the Metropolitan Police for his alleged involvement in a conspiracy to defraud mortgage lenders out of an estimated £7 million . The identities of Britain's nine 'most wanted' criminals thought to be hiding in Cyprus have been revealed today. The eight men and one woman on the run are accused of various crimes including rape, drug dealing and perverting the course of justice. Their identities have been released amid fears that northern Cyprus, which has no extradition treaty with the UK, could become the equivalent of the Costa del Sol where criminals escaped to in the 70s and 80s as they couldn't be extradited back to the UK. The nine are believed to currently be residing in the Republic . of Cyprus but some may cross the Green Line into the self-declared . Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus to avoid being extradited back to the UK if arrested under a European warrant. Crimestoppers released the list of the nine 'most wanted' compiled by the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) and Cypriot authorities in a bid to help bring them to justice. The list includes Paul Lockwood, 41, who is . sought by Greater Manchester Police for allegedly raping a child. Wayne .

Suspects: Timur Mehmet, 39, left, from Buckinghamshire, was convicted in his absence and jailed for eight years for conspiracy to cheat the public revenue in a £25 million fraud and Greek-Cypriot Costas Sampson, 21, is wanted by the Metropolitan Police over allegations he raped a woman who he met at a club . Safe haven: The nine most wanted are believed to be in the Republic of Cyprus but could cross into Turkish-controlled Northern Cyprus, pictured, where it would be harder to extradite them to the UK . 'While . these suspected criminals will see Cyprus as a safe place to evade law . enforcement, my belief is that with the help of the local public and . expatriate community, these individuals will not be able to escape . justice for much longer.' The scheme, called Operation Zygos, targets criminals who could be hiding in the Republic of Cyprus or Turkish-controlled Northern Cyprus. Tycoon Asil Nadir evaded justice for nearly two decades after fleeing Britain to his native northern Cyprus in 1993 after being accused of theft following the collapse of his Polly Peck empire. It was not until August 2010 that Nadir returned to London claiming he could not live with the ‘burning sense of injustice’. But he was jailed after finally being convicted of stealing millions from his business to fund his extraordinary luxury lifestyle.

Scots face a 15 per cent hike in taxes or severe cuts in public services if they vote to separate from the rest of the United Kingdom, a report will warn today. Public spending in Scotland is already 11 per cent higher per person than for the UK as a whole at £7,932 – an extra £1,128 - the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies claimed. An independent Scotland would need to rein in spending at the same rate as the UK government to achieve economic credibility on the world stage. This would amount to £2.5billion cut for Scotland. North Sea oil revenues are projected to fall by £3.4billion, meaning the Scottish economy would contract by nearly £6billion (file picture) An independent Scotland as proposed by Alex Salmond (pictured) would need to reign in spending at the same rate as the UK government, which would amount to a £2.5billion cut, the Institute for Fiscal Studies claimed . North Sea oil revenues are also projected to fall by £3.4billion, meaning the Scottish economy would contract by nearly £6billion. Scottish residents get a level of public services that others in Britain can only dream of. Students at universities do not pay tuition fees – unless they are a resident in England or outside of the EU. All prescriptions are free and the elderly get free social care. The money is allocated from the Treasury on the basis of population and can be spent by Scotland as it wishes in devolved areas such as health and education. But a report published today by the IFS says: ‘Such a £5.9billion consolidation would amount to a cut of around 15 per cent, based on 2011-12 levels, of public service spending.’ David Phillips, of the IFS, said: ‘Spending on public services is substantially higher per person in Scotland than in the UK as a whole. ‘This is driven by higher spending on many areas like transport, housing, economic development and social services. ‘The Scottish government has used the existing powers under devolution to set different priorities for spending in Scotland.’ Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg ¿ who opposes independence ¿ used his conference speech in Glasgow to promise to fight for more powers for Scotland . He added that while Scotland could make savings on defence and foreign aid, ‘it is unlikely that cuts here would allow Scotland to avoid cuts elsewhere, unless it were to increase taxes substantially’. ‘Indeed, given the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts for declining North Sea revenues, even with cuts to defence and aid spending, an independent Scotland may need to cut spending on other services or raise taxes by more than if it remained part of the UK.’ Spending on social services in Scotland is 26 per cent higher than in the UK. The cost of this has risen by 77 per cent in the last decade. A poll for the Scottish Daily Mail has showed 59 per cent are planning to vote against separation. Just 27 per cent of Scots are in favour of independence, the poll by Progressive Scottish Opinion showed. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg – who opposes independence – used his conference speech in Glasgow to promise to fight for more powers for Scotland. Former chancellor Alistair Darling, who is leading the Better Together campaign, said the current system gave Scots the ‘best of both worlds’. All the main parties would have to promise more powers, he said. The nationalist MSP claimed that breaking-up the successful team that won 29 gold medals in London last year would ‘bring many benefits’. Scottish badminton star Imogen Bankier insisted that being part of the UK set-up means ‘we’ll be high up the medal table. That wouldn’t happen if we went independent.’","Institute for Fiscal Studies claims an independent Scotland would need to cut at the same rate as the UK government to achieve economic credibility .

The father of the teen who committed suicide after years of bullying said he was 'disgusted' after Facebook featured an ad for online dating which used a picture of his daughter. The social networking site was forced to apologize and issued a statement late on Tuesday saying the ad featuring Rehtaeh Parsons was a 'gross violation' of the company's policies and has since been removed. The ad said, 'Find Love in Canada! Meet Canadian girls and women for friendship, dating or relationships'. The 17-year-old was taken off life support after she was found hanging in her bathroom in April, two years after she was gang-raped by classmates. Mistake: Facebook has apologized and banned a dating company from advertising on its website after this ad featuring a photo of Rehtaeh Parsons was used . Tragedy: Rehtaeh Parsons, 17, took her life in April after enduring months of bullying after an alleged gang rape . Her father Glen Canning said the use of her photo was 'disgusting'. 'I am completely bewildered and disgusted by this,' he said. 'This is my daughter, Rehtaeh. They have her in an ad for meeting singles. I don’t even know what to say.' Facebook said the dating website, Ionechat.com, has been banned. The site could not be reached for comment. Parsons' tragic suicide brought international attention to her claims that she . was gang-raped when she was 15 and then relentlessly tormented by . classmates who called her a 'slut' and harassed her for sex. Much . of the bullying was a result of a photo circulated at her school . that showed Parsons being assaulted by a teen boy while throwing up out a . window. The two . 18-year-olds involved have been charged with child pornography. One is accused of . taking the picture, both are accused of circulating it. Because the . alleged crime took place when the men were 16, they are charged as . juveniles and their identities cannot be revealed. Death threats: Since Rehtaeh Parsons, 17, killed herself in April, her father, Glen Canning, pictured, has been a vocal advocate against cyberbullying and has demanded justice in her case . 'Victim': Parsons, pictured, was labelled a 'slut' after she was allegedly gang raped by four teenagers in 2010 . Protection: The two teenage suspects, now 18, cannot be identified under Canadian law because they were 16 when the alleged crime took place . Rehtaeh's . heartbroken parents say that she hanged herself in their bathroom two . years after the alleged attack because she could not bear to bullying . and torment at school. Rehtaeh's . death led to an outcry because no one was charged or even reprimanded . at the school - either for her rape or for the bullying. Four boys, aged 14, 17 and two aged . 16, allegedly took it in turns to sexually assault her on November 12, 2011, after plying her with . alcohol, she told her mother days after. Her . mother said she saw an image of the alleged attack which showed her . daughter being raped by a teenage boy as he gave a 'thumbs up' sign while she vomited out of a window. Police initially concluded there were no grounds to charge anyone after a year-long investigation. 'No help': Cole Harbour High School staff failed to speak to the boys involved and Rehtaeh left . Rehtaeh . eventually closed down her Facebook page because there were so many men . asking her to have sex with them. They would say: ‘You had sex with my . friend, so why not me?’ The . response from the school was, apparently, to do very little. Halifax . school board spokesman Doug Hadley has said that none of the boys were . spoken to. Rehtaeh's death prompted the Nova Scotia government to launch reviews of . the RCMP's original investigation and the school board's handling of . the matter.

David Cameron must stop pussyfooting around and heed voters fed-up with him on immigration and the EU. Thursday’s local elections results were disappointing for the Conservative Party. No one can deny that. We lost many hard-working councillors and other parties, including UKIP, made an unsettling number of gains. The results were also a potential disaster for voters. In my Windsor constituency we have the lowest council tax rate outside of London and some of the best public services. There is now a danger the council tax freeze by Conservative authorities up and down the country could be reversed by newly elected Labour councillors. But the electorate have spoken and I want us to listen. As a party, we need to ask ourselves some serious questions: Why did voters in Conservative strongholds feel the party was no longer on their side? Why did some voters lose faith in the party to deliver a bright and vibrant future for the country? I have been a grassroots Conservative for more than 25 years. I know what our party stands for. We want smaller government; we want to unleash the transformative power of enterprise; we want simpler, lower taxes and we want to put Britain first in everything it does. But, right now, our strong and popular message does not seem to be reaching the public – we must start tackling the issues that matter to people. People no longer believe we have the grit, determination and political will to deal with the problems of immigration and Europe. They feel their country is careering down a slippery slope towards membership of a giant federal Europe – a new nation super-state that they did not agree to join. They see British legislation replaced by new EU laws, and all they hear is: ‘It’s an EU regulation – we can’t do anything about it.’ Now, if we want to control our borders, we need prior permission from unelected European commissioners. But getting a grip on immigration is essential if we are going to stand up for the interests of our citizens. High levels of immigration put severe pressure on UK public services and infrastructure, push up the cost of housing and put a strain on the job market. In my view there are four major groups of immigrants: Illegal, asylum seekers, people working here legally on work visas and students. Of course, tourists regularly visit the UK too. Adam Afriyie says the Conservatives lost many hard-working Conservative councillors to Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party . Illegal immigrants should be deported. Tourists and genuine students should be welcomed with open arms – because every pound they spend in Britain, on our high streets or in our universities, contributes to this country’s long-term prosperity. Next, we must make sure that people here on working visas are net contributors to Britain – that they are adding to the Treasury and contributing to British public services. That is why I propose mandatory health insurance for all temporary visitors to this country. It could be paid and processed alongside the  normal visa process. It would relax financial pressure on the NHS and guarantee continued investment where required to deal with the increased load. If the US and Australia can implement an effective health insurance scheme for visitors, why can’t we? Next, I propose non-British citizens working in the UK pay a tax supplement of, say, two per cent on top of their base-rate income tax. That would guarantee foreign workers are contributing to the upkeep of the UK – contributing to strong British courts, UK defence and vital national services. But if these measures are to be effective, they must also apply to EU immigrants. The EU is the burdensome, federal elephant in the room. It would be unfair to UK citizens and other non-EU immigrants who are paying their way, if tens of thousands of annual EU immigrants were given a free ride. So we must reject the idea of pan-European citizenship. Currently, the UK cannot target measures at other EU citizens because we are all ‘citizens of Europe’. To have any hope of building a better future for Britain we must restore our status as a sovereign country and renegotiate with the EU. And if that fails, we must remember that withdrawal is a serious option. I want to see a country at ease with itself – an integrated Britain that welcomes hard-working people from wherever. But we must implement policies that ensure working immigrants are net contributors to British life, the British economy and British culture.","Proposes mandatory health insurance for all temporary visitors to UK .

With their massive bodies, huge ears and shaggy coats, they are not so much donkeys as woolly mammoths. And farmer Annie Pollock finds the Baudet de Poitou so irresistible that she has built up a herd of 22, the biggest in the UK. The donkeys can grow to more than 8ft tall – larger than most horses – and are renowned for their friendly and mischievous personalities. Enormous: Farmer Annie Pollock, seen with giant donkey Izzy, has the largest herd of Baudet de Poitou donkeys in the UK . They date back to medieval times in . France, and were popular working animals until the mid-20th century, . when mechanisation made them obsolete. A survey in 1977 found just 44 . surviving donkeys, and despite breeding programmes there are still fewer . than 1,000 in the world. Miss Pollock, 52, from Lymington in . the New Forest, has spent nine years building up her herd, seven of . which would have gone for slaughter but for her intervention. She and her small team of farm hands . work round the clock to look after the creatures, dedicating hours to . grooming so their coats do not turn into dreadlocks. Loveable: Poitou foals Charlie and Cadeau at the farm in Hampshire, where the farmer made a home for rescued donkeys that had been bound for the abbatoir in France . Ms Pollock, one of only two Poitou breeders in the UK, said: 'In 2004 I phoned a lady in France looking to buy a llama, and ended up with two Poitou donkeys which I instantly fell in love with. 'I started looking into the breed and found out they were incredibly rare. 'Gradually I built up the herd, and then started rescuing them. 'I have rescued seven from France which would have otherwise ended up going to the slaughter house. 'Word spread I was rescuing them and I have since been approached by a lot of people about taking in their Poitou. 'The breed were to France what shire horses are to Britain and were exported all over the world,' Ms Pollock said. 'Then came mechanisation and they fell out of favour. 'There are still less than 1,000 in the stud book and we have 22 of them,' she added. Critically endangered: There now are less than 1,000 Poitou donkeys like Izzy in existence . Mischievous: Ms Pollock said the donkeys are funny and friendly, but also 'a bit naughty' The biggest donkey at Annie’s 120-acre Norley Farm is Verveine, dwarfing standard donkeys at a whopping 16 hands - or 5ft 4ins - measured to its shoulders. Its huge neck and head add several extra feet to its overall height. The largest in the world lives on a farm in Texas and stands at 17 hands (5ft 7ins). The biggest donkey in the UK is thought to be at a farm in Lincolnshire, standing at 8ft tall when measured from the ground to the tip of its ears. Annie added: 'Verveine is huge and will probably get a bit bigger still. At 16 hands she is quite a bit bigger than people like to ride horses. 'Most people tend to ride horses that are 14 or 15 hands. 'Historically they had very poor diets so we actually have to limit what they eat otherwise they will grow too big. 'I love their temperament, they’re so funny and friendly, and they teach you patience. 'They’re very intelligent and also a bit naughty. People often write-off donkeys but  I think they are just wonderful.'","Annie Pollock began rescuing giant Poitou donkeys bound for abbatoirs .

Dissatisfied doctors are labeling their careers million-dollar mistakes and less than half would choose to work in medicine again if they had the chance to do it all over again. Crippled by student debt and burdened by mountains of paperwork instead of healing the sick, doctors fear their careers will become blighted when Obamacare is fully enacted in the coming years. The sense of impending doom surrounding health professionals is exacerbated by the fact that almost one third of doctors, or 28 percent, had to take a pay cut last year. Regrets: Less than half of all doctors would still choose a career in medicine and less than half of doctors are satisfied with their choice in specialty . While or course doctors are paid handsomely for their expertise, the average newly practicing physician is $166,750 in debt. However, relatively speaking, it requires 11 to 14 years of intense higher education to become a doctor which means that a skilled physician does not earn a full-time salary until 10-years after a typical college graduate starts earning. That equates to a literal lost decade of earning potential and if it is assumed that the lowest a college graduate takes home is $50,000 annually then that equals around half a million in lost salary. The million dollar regret is topped off when it is assumed that the total medical school debt repaid is $419,738, based on an average $166,750 taking 30 years to repay at 7.5 percent interest. Wealthiest: The lowest paid doctors still have 11 total years of higher education and training. All practicing physicians must complete undergraduate and graduate education (8 years) plus a minimum residency of 3 years . The real dissatisfaction grows at pediatric, family and internal medicine level. Their annual salary is on average barely more than their medical school debt according to a study that looked at George Washington University's School of Public Health and the American Association of Medical Colleges and Medscape. Of these three specialities, the least satisfied were internal medical physicians who see two patients per hour while spending 23 percent of their time on paperwork. They work 54 hours a week, earn $185,000 annually and almost a fifth have seen a cut in their pay. Throughout the entire field, only 19 percent would choose the same speciality and one third are so upset that they wouldn't choose a career in medicine again. 'Administrative tasks account for nearly one-quarter of a doctor's day,' Christina Lamontagne of NerdWallet said. 'With additional liability concerns and more layers in health care, we can understand the drain this takes.' 'The frustrations that patients have about not getting enough time with their doctor is mirrored by the frustration their doctors have with not having enough time to spend with their patients.' Salary can vary significantly by location. Orthopedic surgeons find higher salaries in the Northwest, where some can make $400,000 more than their mid-Atlantic counterparts . The best paid doctors are orthopedic surgeons, who earn on average $405,000 per year. The happiest doctors are neurologists who despite earning $216,000 and work 55 hours a week are satisfied with their job. Indeed, 66 percent of neurologists would choose the same speciality and 53 percent would choose to enter medicine again. Oncologists are also very satisfied with their jobs, with 62 percent saying they wouldn't change their career and 57 percent reporting they would choose to battle cancer as their field of choice. Radiologists have suffered the largest pay cut in the past year, with 42 percent reporting their decline in salary - this is despite the fact they are among the best paid doctors, earning an average of $349,000. The most worked physicians are cardiologists who are on the job for 60 hours a week and earns $357,000 a year. On the front lines, emergency room doctors are the least likely to have suffered a pay cut and earn an average of $270,000 a year and work 46 hours a week.","Less than half of all doctors would still choose a career in medicine .

More than 250 people turned out to mourn Rebecca Sedwick at the heart-breaking 45-minute service in Bartlow. Her friends and family sobbed and pallbearers wore neon green T-shirts to protest against bullying. Green was Rebecca's favorite color. Rebecca's body was in a closed white casket and a nearby sign read: 'Everyday, more and more kids kill themselves because of bullying. How many lives have to be lost until people realize words do matter?' Photographs of her were on display in the funeral home. Rebecca, who was picked on by as many as 15 girls online and in text messages, threw herself from a tower at an abandoned concrete plant last week, detectives said. Funeral: Pallbearers wearing anti-bullying T-shirts carry the casket of Rebecca Sedwick, 12, to a waiting hearse as they exit the Whidden-McLean Funeral Home Monday, September 16, 2013, in Bartow, Florida . Too much: Rebecca's friends sob ahead of the funeral of Rebecca Sedwick, who leaped to her death last week . Authorities are investigating whether there is enough evidence to bring charges against any of the girls. They have seized computers and cellphones from some of them and said the girls' parents were cooperating with police. Computer search records revealed on Friday that the 12-year-old girl had been looking for ways to commit suicide on the internet prior to her death. After Rebecca's suicide, police looked at her computer and found search queries such as 'What is overweight for a 13-year-old girl' and various ways to kill herself. One of the girl's screensavers also showed Rebecca with her head resting on a railroad track. She changed one of her online screen names to 'That Dead Girl.' She messaged a boy: 'I'm jumping.' Missed: Rebecca Sedwick died earlier this week after years of online bullying . Bullying: Polk County Sheriff's Office investigators say they believe Rebecca leaped to her death from a structure at an abandoned cement plant last week following months of bullying . Life cut short: The 12-year-old was carried in a closed white coffin from the funeral home to a waiting hearse for the service on Monday . And then, on Monday, she went to an abandoned concrete plant in Lakeland where she liked to hang out, climbed a tower and hurled herself to her death. Her body was found on Tuesday. Police are investigating as many as 15 girls to see who contributed to driving Rebecca to suicide. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said Rebecca had been 'absolutely terrorized' by the other girls. 'We can see from what we've been investigating so far that Rebecca wasn't attacking back,' Judd said. 'She appeared to be beat down. She appeared to have a defeatist attitude. And quite frankly, the entire investigating is exceptionally disturbing.'

Aftermath: Rebecca's sister Summer (left) and a friend sign a poster as police are now investigating whether more than a dozen girls bullied Rebecca before she died on Monday night . The bullying started over a boy last year at Crystal Lake Middle School and at one point she was suspended for fighting with a girl who was previously considered her friend. Last December, Rebecca was hospitalized for three days after cutting her wrists because of what she said was bullying, according to the sheriff. 'When she was being bullied at Crystal Lake Middle, she used to come home every day and tell me how she wasn’t worth anything, that she was ugly, how she was stupid,' Tricia Norman said. 'And I said, ''Baby what on earth would make you think that? You’re the most beautiful person I know and the smartest person I know.'''

Tributes: Flowers, candles and messages are left out in memory of 12-year-old Rebecca . Later, after Rebecca complained that she had been pushed in the hallway and that another girl wanted to fight her, Rebecca's mother began home-schooling her, Judd said. Horrible: Searches on Rebecca Sedwick's show that she was concerned about being overweight and was looking for ways to kill herself . This fall, Rebecca started at a new school, Lawton Chiles Middle Academy, and loved it, Judd said. But the bullying continued online. 'She put on a perfect, happy face. She never told me,' Rebecca's mother, Tricia Norman, told the Lakeland Ledger. 'I never had a clue. I mean, she told me last year when she was being bullied, but not this year, and I have no idea why.' Once police checked her cell phone they discovered that the bullying had not stopped, especially on Kik Messenger, Instagram and Ask.fm. 'They would tell her she's ugly, stupid, nobody liked her go kill herself,"" Ms Norman said. She has started a Facebook page to try to fight back against online bullies, called Rebecca Sedwick Against Bullying. Ms Norman told 10 News she was inspired to start it after reading her daughter's journal. In it, Rebecca had written: 'Every day more and more kids kill themselves because of bullying. How many lives have to be lost until people realize words do matter?' Ms Norman wants online bullies to face harsher consequences, and begged other young victims to stay strong and seek help, adding: 'Don't ever give up, like Becca did.'

Here's a fascinating glimpse inside the shipping container homes set to be used as temporary accommodation for homeless people. A housing trust in Brighton wants to use the 36 adapted containers as a stop-gap for people without a permanent home. It is the latest plan aimed at tackling Brighton and Hove's 'desperate' housing crisis. Scroll down for video . Success: The shipping container homes will be similar to this student accommodation built in Amsterdam in 2006 . Problem solving: Brighton Housing Trust hopes the shipping container will help solve the city's housing crisis . Container city: The stacked container homes have proved successful in Holland where they have housed the Amsterdam's student population . The containers have been transformed into self-contained studio flats, and feature bathrooms, kitchens and plasterboarded walls. The structures were designed for a social . housing project in Amsterdam two years ago but the scheme had to be . abandoned after hitting funding difficulties. It is hoped they will instead be used as temporary homes in Brighton and Hove from late spring next year until a permanent roof can be found. The Brighton Housing Trust and developer QED are to submit a planning application to the local city council for a central site featuring the modified containers with allotments on the roofs. Andy Winter, chief executive of Brighton Housing Trust, said 'imaginative solutions' were needed to deal with the 'desperate' housing situation in the city. Concern: Brighton and Hove authorities recognise homelessness is a serious problem in the city. Some 43 rough sleepers were counted there this month (file picture) Shipping-container homes have been . used elsewhere, including in London, and are seen as a significantly . cheaper housing option than bricks and mortar. The . plans in Brighton follow a warning from leading housing bodies this . month that homelessness and overcrowding are getting worse amid . Britain’s housing shortage. High property prices averaging around . £302,000, steep private rents and low average wages in the seaside city . have contributed to high levels of homelessness . The . problems come against a background of rising private sector rents and . as more people are claiming housing benefit nationwide, a report by . Shelter, the National Housing Federation and the Chartered Institute of . Housing said. Mr Winter said: 'I have to admit that when it was first suggested to me that shipping containers be used for housing I was a bit sceptical. 'However, having seen what can be achieved, I was quickly won over. The WC and shower unit is exactly the same as my daughter had in her student accommodation and she much preferred it to having to share bathrooms and toilets with other students. Who wouldn’t? 'What really excites me about this opportunity is that land that might otherwise lie idle for five years will be brought back into life and used to provide much-needed temporary accommodation for 36 men and women in Brighton and Hove.' Much-needed: Bright Housing Trust say the container homes are desperately needed to help solve the city's housing crisis . Production: Tempo Housing has these shipping container homes manufactured in China before they are installed around Europe . When the site comes to be redeveloped, the containers can be transferred to other locations. Mr Winter added: 'This appears to me to be very attractive from a sustainability perspective.' Comfortable: The shipping container homes will be a stop-gap for people without accommodation in Brighton . Exciting: Brighton Housing Trust says it needs 'imaginative' solutions to help solve the city's housing crisis . Shelter chief executive Campbell Robb . said the Government 'simply isn’t delivering the new homes we need'. And . David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, said . there had been'“words and policy' but 'we’ve not had delivery'. In Brighton and Hove, the authorities recognise homelessness as a significant problem, with 43 people found sleeping rough during an annual headcount this month, up six from the previous year. Mr Winter highlighted the case of one man who was living in his car and holding down a job. Shortage: The containers are manufactured in China using old shipping containers before being delivered to Europe . Problem: Average property prices of more than £300,000 and low wages have contributed to high levels of homelessness in Brighton . Innovative: The 36 containers purchased by Brighton Housing Trust which had been earmarked for a social housing project in Amsterdam two years ago but funding fell through . He said he would not want to see the shipping containers used as a long-term housing option here, but there are examples in mainland Europe. 'The most notable project is in Keetwonen, Amsterdam, a development by TempoHousing, of 1,000 containers using exactly the same internal design layout as the ones we are proposing to use.

A U.S biologist has found human behaviour could be driving the evolution of animals' brains by changing the habitats in which they live. The research suggests the brains of some animals have got bigger in tandem with the industrialisation of their habitat - making some city animals smarter than their rural peers. Evolutionary biologist Emilie Snell-Rood discovered white-footed mouse and meadow voles living in cities, had on average brains that were six per cent larger than the brains of animals collected from farms in the countryside. A U.S. biologist has found human behaviour could be driving the evolution of animals' brains by changing the habitats in which they live. The research suggests the brains of some animals such as this white-footed mouse have got bigger in tandem with the industrialisation of their habitat . Associate Professor Snell-Rood, of the University of Minnesota's College of Biological Sciences, believes animals are showing 'complex cognitive responses to both urban and rural areas with cranial capacity tracking human-induced change in some cases'. She is interested in whether small animals will be able to cope with the conversion of prairies to agriculture or forests being replaced by cities to ultimately cope with human-induced change. Previous research found a link between brain size and the ability to adapt to urban environments in birds, but did not investigate whether the change of environment caused the evolution. Together with undergraduate student Naomi Wick, Professor Snell-Rood set out to find 'if dealing with a new environment is just a . matter of species sorting - in which a particular species is ""pre-adapted"" for success in a particular environment - or actually . changes going on within species in addition to that species-level . variation'. The researchers examined specimens from the Bell Museum of Natural History collections dating back to the early 20th Century, focusing on the cranial capacity of 10 species, including varieties of shrews, voles, bats, and squirrels, along with a mouse and gopher, from locations in and around the Twin Cities metro. Evolutionary biologist Emilie Snell-Rood discovered white-footed mouse and meadow voles (pictured) living in cities, had on average brains that were 6 per cent larger than the brains of animals collected from farms in the countryside . They found the urban populations of two of the species did, in fact, possess significantly greater cranial capacity and predicted that if cleverer animals thrived in urban environments, cranial capacity should also increase over time. The white-footed mouse and meadow voles . living in cities, had on average brains that were 6 per cent larger than the brains of their peers collected from rural habitats. While the researchers can’t say for . certain whether the changes are evolutionary or developmental, evidence . suggests the former. 'We tended to not see changes in body size which . suggests it’s not just nutritional, but rather an evolutionary . response,' said Professor Snell-Rood. She said the study 'reminds us of the fact that populations adapt, and that at least some . species are tracking human-induced environmental change.' The researchers found the urban populations of two . of the species did possess significantly greater cranial . capacity and predicted that if cleverer animals thrived in urban . environments, cranial capacity should  increase over time. Pictured is a squirrel (left) and gopher (right) enjoying life close to humans . However, some of the specimens examined contradicted her theory. 'We didn’t see cranial capacity increases over time in the urban specimens...and actually, for two species we see a decline over time, while the bats and shrews show an increase in cranial capacity in rural populations.' Professor Snell-Rood said: 'Neural tissue is incredibly expensive metabolically. There are trade-offs in investing in brains and investing in reproduction, which may be why we see a reduction in cranial capacity over time in two of the species – larger brains may be favored just during the initial colonisation of the city.' She thinks humans are changing rural environments in ways that could be just as challenging as cities, resulting in the changes in cranial capacity over time seen in bats and shrews.","A U.S. evolutionary biologist has found human behaviour could be driving the evolution of animals' brains by changing the habitats in which they live .

Ms Anantyowati, 40, said: 'This was an amazing moment for me - watching the two otters fighting.

The cost of fruit and vegetables will soar unless Britain opens its borders to more foreign workers, it was warned today. Prices for strawberries and celery in particular could rise, because of a shortage of cheap labour. The Migration Advisory Committee said supermarkets will be forced to push up prices or import more food, piling pressure on British farmers. A shortage of migrant workers when employment rules change could push up the price of fruit and vegetables, the Migration Advisory Committee said . Almost 22,000 Romanians and Bulgarians are employed under the seasonal agricultural workers scheme  but it is due to close when access restrictions are lifted at the end of 2013. British growers fear a shortage of workers could lead to a surge in labour costs and ultimately higher prices for consumers. Professor David Metcalf, MAC chair, said the Government should consider proposals for a new scheme that targets non-EU workers. In particular countries which have a high number of agricultural students such as the Ukraine could be targeted. Mr Metcalf told a press conference that if the labour supply ‘dwindled’ once the scheme closed to Romanians and Bulgarians, operators may have to ‘drive wages up’ to secure staff. He said: ;In those circumstances, therefore, it's possible that supermarkets would charge higher prices for their celery and strawberries and so on.’ The price of strawberries in particular could rise, the chairman of the MAC Professor David Metcalf said . Mr Metcalf said supermarkets may also start to import produce from overseas to keep consumer prices competitive. ‘If the growers need to pay much higher wages, the prices to the supermarket would go up then, it's possible then imports would go up.’ Mr Metcalf said the consequences of a shrinking labour supply include seeing the whole horticulture sector in Britain contract and lead to an increase in technology being used instead of manual labour. Mr Metcalf said considering an alternative source of employment - such as countries outside the EU - was ‘a matter for the Government’. He added: ‘It's very important to emphasise that, if we did have a replacement source, the implication is that horticulture is a favoured sector. ‘It gets a supply of cheap labour, reliable labour and, more importantly, hired labour which is not available to any other sector.’ He added: ‘The only way that we should have a replacement scheme is if such a scheme would help horticulture thrive in the long run and the evidence from stake holders is that it would do.’ Last month farming minister David Heath warned families they will have to grow more of their own fruit and vegetables to cope with food shortages. He recast the famous World War Two slogan urging Brits to ‘dig for victory’ with a stark warning of the need to ‘dig for survival’ in the future. Farming minister David Heath has warned families to consider growing more of their own fruit and vegetables if Britain is hit by a food shortage crisis . Fruit prices are more than 10 per cent higher than last year with vegetable costs up 6.7 per cent. Mr Heath said: ‘With an increasing population, increasing demand not just in this country but across the world, we are going to have to increase food production. ‘We made a huge mistake a few years ago when the idea got around that we didn't need to produce in the agricultural sector any more, that we would be able to buy our way through whatever was necessary to feed the country. ‘Once we used to “dig for victory”. There may come a time soon when we need to “dig for survival”.’ The MAC said a lack of seasonal workers was a medium to long term risk with British farmers likely to be able to recruit a sufficient number in the first one to two years after the working restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanians are lifted. A Home Office spokeswoman said: ‘We are grateful for the MAC's report and note its conclusion that that there is little evidence the supply of seasonal labour will decline in the next one or two years. ‘We shall consider the MAC's advice very carefully, however in general we want to encourage employers to recruit from the resident labour market where possible.’","Rules to end allowing Romanians and Bulgarians to work in UK .

Amid chants in a darkened room, two-year-old Chua Wan Zuen was pinned down under a blanket by eight people - two of whom were not charged - in a bizarre attempt to crush out the evil spirits they said had consumed her. The child was held down by the group for what doctors believed were several tortuous hours, but they told police they did not intend to kill her. The family of Chua Wan Zuen told Malaysian police they had not intended to kill the toddler during the ritual. They were spared jail and fined after admitting their guilt (file photo) A Malaysian court sitting in northern Penang state, fined the parents, an uncle, an aunt and grandmother 10,000 ringgit (£2,000) each after they pleaded guilty to causing Chua's death by negligence. The child's 21-year-old cousin was fined 5,000 ringgit while another cousin, aged 16, was released on probation. When the seven family members had originally appeared in court they pleaded not guilty. But as their trial proceeded they admitted they committed the offence at their home in the northern town of Bukit Mertajam. An Indonesian maid, who police said had joined the seven others in the ritual, was not charged because she agreed to testify against the ethnic Chinese family. The family members could have been sent to jail for up to 10 years - but if they fail to pay the fines they could still end up behind bars for up to seven months, The Star newspaper reported. Forensic doctor Zahari Noorsaid told how the presence of blood in Chua's respiratory system indicated she was still breathing when she was pinned down. He said it was possible she was pressed down to the floor, as there were injuries on the right side of her face as well as on her hands legs, body, neck and lips. The family killed the two-year-old at their home in Bukit Mertajam, in northern Penang province (file photo) Police revealed earlier that the family had carried out the exorcism ritual because they believed she was possessed by evil spirits. When officers raided the house after receiving a distress call from a family member, they found eight people lying on top of the girl in a darkened bedroom, said district police chief Azman Abdul Lah. She was face down under the human pile and chanting could be heard. Belief in the supernatural is entrenched among Malaysia's Malay, Chinese and ethnic communities, although occult rituals have waned in recent years. In 2010 two Malay cousins were sentenced to 10 years in jail for killing the parents of one of them during a spiritual cleansing ritual. They had killed the parents by trying to beat evil out of them by hitting them with brooms and motor cycle helmets.","Chua Wan Zuen was pinned under a blanket and the relatives piled on top .

Under threat: Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition could be harmed by the rise of anti-EU party AfP . The coalition currently governing Germany could be under threat from an emerging anti-European Union party, according to the results of an opinion poll. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party looks set to enter German parliament the Bundestag for the first time, after a survey conducted by INSA on behalf of the respected Bild newspaper showed support for the party was growing. That could spell trouble for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has headed up the ruling coalition between her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party and the smaller Free Democratic Party (FDP) since she first came to power in 2005. And support for the emerging Euro-sceptic party is further proof of German disquiet at having to bail out the struggling economies of some of the southern European states, particularly Greece, and to prop-up the euro indefinitely at a cost of billions. If the results of the opinion poll are anything to go by, Mrs Merkel's party is set to take a 38 per cent share of the vote, with six per cent going to the FDP. With a combined 44 per cent of the vote, that that would leave the coalition outnumbered by the other three rival parties in the Bundestag - the centre left Social Democratic Party (SDP), the hard-left Die Linke party and the Greens. Furthermore, the AfD, which is fighting to have powers repatriated from Brussels, looks set to take five per cent of the vote - the minimum share required to win seats in the Bundestag. While it is unlikely her main rival – the . centre left SDP – would be able to formulate a working coalition with . the hard-left Die Linke party, analysts say the entry of an AfD . bloc would rob Mrs Merkel's coalition of a governing . majority based on current estimates of its number of seats. Such . an outcome would most likely force her to form a left-right 'grand . coalition' with the SDP, who increased their share of the vote by one per cent to 28 per cent in the latest poll. Although the SDP has publicly stated it does not want a grand coalition, experts believe it would probably enter into one if push came to shove. The electorate is due to go to the polls on Sunday.

Twenty thousand migrants a year are being let into Britain under a loophole that could be exploited by sham-marriage racketeers, a report warns today. Under European law, EU nationals living in this country are allowed to bring in spouses or partners and their families from anywhere in the world with no checks or qualifications. But British citizens who want to bring in a wife, husband or partner and family from abroad must first show they have an income of £18,600 or more to guarantee their dependants will not become a burden on the taxpayer. Think-tank MigrationWatch UK warns 20,000 people are entering Britain through a migration loophole . The report by the MigrationWatch UK think-tank warns that 20,000 people a year are now coming to live in Britain as partners of a citizen of another EU country. The loophole means the system is wide open to abuse by racketeers who can charge vast sums of money to set up a sham marriage, it said. Sir Andrew Green of MigrationWatch said: ‘This is a loophole that must be closed and soon. 'It is absurd that EU citizens should be in a more favourable position than our own citizens. 'Furthermore, 20,000 per year is a very large number to admit unconditionally, especially compared to the government’s target of tens of thousands for annual net migration.’ Under the rules, a member of the family of an EU citizen - who has the right to travel to and work freely in Britain - can bring in their family under a ‘European Economic Area family permit’. The permit is issued to any national of another EU country who is living in Britain and applies for it. Under EU law, EU nationals living in the UK can bring their spouse or partner with no checks . The report said: ‘A Polish or French person can marry someone from outside the EU, say Kenya or Vietnam, and can bring their spouse into the UK, even if they do not have a job earning £18,600 or indeed any job. ‘The couple would be entitled to full access to the welfare state. A British or non-EU settled resident would not be allowed to bring in a spouse without this minimum income.’ A number of Indian nationals from the former Portuguese territory of Goa are thought to have taken advantage of the loophole. Indians living in Goa can claim they have Portuguese heritage and so claim Portuguese citizenship. They can then move directly to Britain – without ever having to visit Portugal – and bring a family without meeting any qualification test. A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'EU citizens do not have unrestricted access to the UK - they must be exercising their treaty rights by working, studying or being self-sufficient. 'The Prime Minister has recently announced a number of changes including strengthening residence testing and limiting the amount of time migrants can claim benefits.'","Think-tank MigrationWatch UK said loophole can be exploited by racketeers .

It slammed into land and rapidly moved . north, destroying buildings, altering coastlines, ripping apart forests . and shocking a population that had never experienced a hurricane. A weather station in Massachusetts recorded sustained winds of 121 mph and gusts as high as 186 mph - a major storm by modern standards that dwarfs the land wind speeds recorded in storms Irene and Sandy, which also devastated parts of the Northeast in recent years.

The hurricane was the death knell for many mills and factories that had barely survived the Great Depression. It stripped 4 million bushels of apples from orchards, killed livestock and felled millions of trees, according to Aviles' research.

Aviles adopts the Works Progress Administration's count of 682. Tidal surges as high as 26 feet were recorded, and Rhode Island suffered the most casualties. The storm was notable not only for the death and destruction it spawned, but also the forward speed that gave it one of its nicknames. It hit Long Island, N.Y., and southern Connecticut moving at an amazing 47 mph, according to the National Weather Service. Despite the recent woes brought by Sandy and Irene, any similar storm in the future will beset a population that has no appreciation of what a true hurricane is, Aviles says. 'No matter what storm you think about in the last century,' she says, 'nothing here compares with 1938.'

The 53-year-old, who spent two months in hospital and has undergone months of physiotherapy to help him walk, takes up the helm again on BBC 1's Andrew Marr Show from September 1 and will also return to Radio 4's Start the Week. He said: I'm hugely looking forward to coming back and want to give it my all but recovering from a stroke does take time. 'We've taken the decision to start with the Sunday show in the autumn and I'm delighted to be returning to present Start the Week on Radio 4 later on in the year.' A Radio 4 spokesman said: 'Andrew is a fantastic presenter and we look forward to having him back on Radio 4. 'Meanwhile Start the Week will continue to be presented by Stephanie Flanders and a few other regulars.' The broadcaster fell ill at his home in East Sheen, south west London at the start of the year. Colleagues were left stunned and concerned when the BBC revealed Mr Marr's illness. He is married to journalist Jackie Ashley and has three children. Guest presenters have stepped in to cover his duties since the stroke.

Official statistics show that strokes are the third biggest cause of death — and somebody suffers one in Britain every five minutes. A stroke is brain damage caused by a blocked blood vessel or bleeding in the brain and can occur at any age but is most common in over-65s (the risk approximately doubles for each decade of life after age 55). Luckily, the stroke hit the left side of Marr's brain — which means his memory and speech are not impaired. In all, there are around 1.2 million stroke survivors in the UK — more than half being left with disabilities that affect their daily life.","The 53-year-old spent two months in hospital after the stroke in January .

The sadistic owner of a dog found with horrific injuries and signs of long-term abuse is being searched for as police warn that other animals - and even people - could be at risk. The two-year-old dog, found near a Massachusetts play park, had been beaten, burned, starved and stabbed in the eyes in what was described as 'medieval' torture. Animal rescue workers described the injuries inflicted on the pit bull, including a crude split to give it a forked serpent tongue, as the worst they had ever seen. Cruel: This two-year-old pit bull was found with horrific injuries . Abused: Puppy Doe weighed only 18lb and had been stabbed, burned and tortured . 'It is highly unlikely that this level . of sadistic cruelty could be shown to one animal and not be part of a . pattern involving other animals or perhaps vulnerable people,' district attorney Michael Morrissey said. The dog's injuries were so severe that she had to be euthanized. When she was found in Quincy on August 31 she weighed only 18lb. A healthy weight for the breed and age is 40lb. When she was first found it was thought that she had been hit by a car, but the true nature of her injuries soon came to light, Fox 25 reported. Vet Martha Smith-Blackmore was so shocked by the extent of the abuse that she had to walk away and give herself a break as she examined the dog's body. 'Her joints were pulled apart like medieval times,' she told the Boston Herald. 'She was beaten, stabbed, burned over weeks to months and maybe her whole life. And could not walk.' The vet added: 'When I saw how vulnerable she was and I understood immediately the duration of her suffering, my heart collapsed.' Sweet natured: Despite having broken bones, crushed vertebrae and other injuries, the pit bull was friendly . Torture: The dog's limbs had been repeatedly pulled apart . Although there was no evidence of sexual interference, which the vet said can be seen in such abuse cases, the dog's joints had been separated from being pulled apart repeatedly. Despite the pain and suffering Puppy Doe had clearly experienced in her short life, staff at the rescue center said she was sweet natured. 'Within hours of being found she had pain medication, food and love. She experienced some tenderness and some care at the end of her life,' Dr Smith-Blackmore said, adding that the dog's injuries were so severe she would have always been in pain if she hadn't been put down. As well as the burn and stab marks, the dog's vertebrae had been smashed from being hit by a baseball bat or board. In pain: The dog had suffered such extensive abuse that she had to be put to sleep . Horrified: Vet Martha Blackmore-Smith says she was heart broken by the extent of abuse the dog suffered . 'Words cannot adequately describe the shocking suffering that Puppy Doe endured or capture the urgency in identifying who did this to her,' Mary Nee, president of the Animal Rescue League shelter that took her in, said . Police are asking anyone who recognizes the dog or has any information on who its owner may be to get in touch. Quincy residents, moved by Puppy Doe's plight, have also been offering rewards for information leading to an arrest.","'Puppy Doe' had been stabbed in the eye and had limbs pulled apart .

The Illinois woman who almost died when a drunk driver hit her head-on in early August thanks the priest who prayed with her at the scene for her survival. At first, 19-year-old Katie Lentz didn't know the identity of the caring priest, since none of the pictures taken at the scene that day pictured him. That mystery sparked a search to identify the holy man, and eventually Father Patrick Dowling of Columbus, Missouri came forward. Scroll Down for Video . Special meeting: Katie Lentz, left, will reunite today with Father Patrick Dowling, right, the Catholic priest who prayed by her side after she was struck head-on by a drunk driver last August . Hanging onto her life: On the morning of August 4, Lentz was hit head-on by a drunk driver and it took emergency crews more than two hours to extricate her from her green Mercedes . Father Dowling briefly visited Lentz . in the hospital one week after the crash, but will enjoy a longer . reunion with the recovering Tulane student today for her twentieth . birthday party at her home in Quincy, Illinois. 'Today is the real reunion,' Lentz's mother Carla told Fox News. Father Dowling first encountered Lentz on the morning of August 4, after his 8:30am Sunday mass . Lentz, . a sophomore at Tulane University, was driving from her parents' Quincy, . Illinois home to Jefferson City, Missouri, where she has a summer . internship. Her Mercedes was hit head-on . by another vehicle, driven by a drunk driver and the accident crushed . Lentz's car in a mangled wreck that left her with multiple broken bones, . a ruptured spleen and damaged liver. At first Father Dowling's identity remained a mystery until he stepped forward after the story was publicized in the media . Recovering: Lentz recovering at the hospital after the crash on August 4. Father Dowling briefly visited her there a week after the crash, but the visit was cut short . Workers from across the county battled for over an hour and a half to extricate Lentz from her car - but she was fading fast and their equipment was not heavy duty enough. It was then that she asked to pray and at that moment the priest appeared to offer his blessings to Lentz and the emergency workers. The silver haired priest was reportedly in his 50s or 60s and was wearing black pants, a black shirt and black collar and seemingly stepped forward to answer Lentz's plea from nowhere. Savior: Since no one recognized Father Dowling, some faithful people hypothesized that the priest was actually the saint Padre Pio . Raymond Reed, the New London fire chief said that it struck him as odd from the start as Highway 19 was blocked off for two miles in each direction and no one from the close-knit community recognized the man. 'We're all local people from four different towns,' Reed said. 'We've only got one Catholic church out of three towns and it wasn't their priest.' Immediately after the 6ft tall priest gave his blessing, the emergency workers righted the car, stabilized Lentz's vital signs and cut her out once the jaws of life appeared from a neighboring town. She was put in an air ambulance and taken to a nearby hospital but by then the priest was gone. For a time, speculation become rife that Lentz may have been visited by the spirit of Catholic Saint Padre Pio. However, despite not appearing in any of the 70 photographs taken at the scene, it was not an aparition who helped Lentz that day, but Father Dowling. 'Their calmness kept me calm as well. So I cannot express my gratitude enough toward them,' Lentz told ABC News. Watch Video Here: . Prayer: When emergency workers could not free her - Katie Lentz asked them to stop so that a prayer could be said . While Dowling left the scene without any fuss, his disappearance added to the mystery. He was quickly dubbed the 'angel priest' and in his absence he became a national celebrity. 'I have no doubt the Most High answered their prayers and I was part of his answer, but only part,' Dowling, a priest in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Jefferson City, told ABC News earlier this month. When she was recovering in the hospital late last month, Lentz spoke of her pride that her story has inspired so many people across the country. 'I love hearing that support, because it's what drives me to push myself harder everyday with therapy,' she said. Impact: Lentz says she loves hearing how her story has inspired others, and how that motivates her to push herself everyday with her therapy . Dowling, under the article on the National Catholic Register site, explained he was in fact responsible for the apparent divine intervention. He said he had been filling in for a sick priest at Mass and was on his way home when he came upon the crash scene. Authorities had closed off the area and were re-routing traffic but Dowling waited until he could get closer. 'I parked behind a large vehicle about 150 yards from the scene. I asked the Sheriff's permission and approached the scene of the accident,' Dowling said. Stuck: It took crews more than two hours to get Lentz out of the car which makes it all the more miraculous that she is going to make a full recovery . 'I absolved and anointed Katie, and, at her request, prayed that her leg would not hurt. Then I stepped aside to where some rescue personnel and the pilot were waiting, and prayed the rosary silently.' He said he left the wreckage just as the helicopter was about to leave to take Katie to hospital. Interestingly, he said he told someone on the scene his name but it must not have been passed on. Fr. Dowling, a native of Kilkenny, . Ireland, was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Jefferson City in 1982 . and has served at parishes in Moberly, Monroe City, Indian Creek, Milan, . Unionville and Eldon, Missouri, and in the diocese’s mission parishes . in Marcona and Nasca, Peru. He is currently serving in prison ministry and in parish ministry to Spanish-speaking Catholics. Progress: At the end of August, Lentz was already able to walk 150 feet unaided .","Illinois student Katie Lentz, 19, will reunite with the priest who prayed by her side the morning she was hit by a drunk driver .

Locals pick the ‘coffee beans’ from the faeces the cats which eat the ripe coffee berries as part of their diet. Once they are cleaned they are roasted. The coffee they produce is described as filled with a deep, mellow flavour, not acidic, with a ‘unique, soft, sweet taste’.

Scroll down for video . Caged: A civet cat on a farm in Indonesia. An investigation found the animals, which produce the sought-after kopi kuwak coffee, suffer in appalling conditions . Distressed: Investigators from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals found cats injured, pacing and showing signs of depression . Frightened: The coffee beans are produced from the civet cats' excrement and can cost up to £60 a cup . Cramped: The coffee has become popular among the rich and famous - but these pictures shine new light on how the expensive delicacy is produced . One farmer explained civets are . generally kept caged for around three years. Another farmer compared . civets eating too many coffee berries to humans smoking, as the civets' health deteriorates greatly during captivity because of a lack of . vitamins and nutrition. Despite the battery farm conditions, many farms sell the product as 'wild', sourced in the jungle from the droppings of free-roaming animals. Tony Wild, former coffee trader and author of 'Coffee: A Dark History', told the BBC: 'The whole reason everybody regurgitates that story is that by being incredibly rare, you can keep a ridiculously high price.' The coffee has surged in popularity, especially in the U.S. and Japan after featuring on the Oprah Winfrey Show and the film, The Bucket List. In a separate investigation by the BBC, it was found one of the most popular products called Wahana Luwak, which is supplied to Harrods, was being produced by a company, Sari Makmur, which uses caged civets. Trapped: The animals are fed vast amounts of berries, which help produce the rich and distinctive flavour of the beans . Dark secret: The final product is often sold as 'wild' - but these images prove the cats are anything but free-range . Confined: Cats are kept in tiny cages for most of the day . Workers said some civets were kept enclosed, despite initial denials from the company, which later backed down and admitted it DID use cages. However, it said the product supplied to Harrods came only from free-range animals and animals were put inside only to study their behaviour. The comapny said in a statement: 'In our caged civet cats programme, we study the animal behaviour, diet and its breeding behaviour. 'In order to sustain or meet the demand for this market, we breed our own civet cats and then release them in our farm when they are mature enough. 'We do not sell any of the coffee beans from the caged luwak as it is against our business model.' Let me out: Industry experts are convinced non-wild civet coffee has ended up on the London market . Money spinner: Harrods is among the shops to sell the delicacy in London but it insists its product is entirely ethical . No hope: This cat looks particularly unhappy as it peers into the camera lens of an animal cruelty investigator . There is no suggestion of animal cruelty on the company's estate. Harrods said: 'Harrods works closely with all its suppliers to ensure the highest standards of ethical sourcing, production and trade are maintained. This is carried out through strict auditing procedures. 'Our exclusive supplier… has given Harrods every assurance the coffee we are provided with is organic, and comes from wild palm civets.' Shop: Harrods said it was confident in its suppliers. The up-market shop sells the beans which can fetch more than £300 a kilo . PETA UK Associate Director Mimi Bekhechi said farms which do enclosed civets were cruel. 'Confining civet cats for years – as they go mad and lose their fur from the stress – for an expensive coffee would turn the stomach of any compassionate person.' In the wild, civets frequently climb trees to reach the ripe coffee berries, but in captivity, they are fed more of the fruit than would ever be natural for them.","Animals which produce sought-after kopi kuwak kept in appalling conditions .

With the stunt being filmed, the car, being driven by his best friend, then accelerated away. But the roundabout was spun with such force that the duct tape failed to hold and Tobias was thrown off. Nearby residents described hearing a man scream before several people shouted for help. One woman who lives near the playground told the Munchner Merkur newspaper: 'I heard this terrible scream and shouts for help. 'When I arrived my husband was already there and he was trying to revive the victim but it was useless. He was covered in blood and I think his neck was broken.' Doctors were unable to save Tobias and he died at the scene. He was a member of a group named the 'Bavarian Dumbasses' that posted video footage of dangerous stunts on YouTube and Facebook. These videos have now been removed. His father today called for the posting of such footage to be outlawed. He told the Bild newspaper: 'Such films should be banned from the Internet. This type of thing cannot happen again.' Police have removed the roundabout from the playground. The German media has claimed that the young men were influenced by the U.S. TV show Jackass which features a group of friends performing unusual and dangerous stunts. The Bavarian group's carousel stunt was to have been their latest filmed escapade for their online fans. They have previously posted footage online of themselves jumping off a bridge into a lake, dripping candlewax into their mouths and sticking drawing pins into their back.","The 20-year-old, known only as Tobias, died instantly from head injuries after Sunday's stunt went wrong .

Jason Lee, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, was initially arrested a month ago after the woman accused him of attacking her at a home he had rented in East Hampton with his wife . A New York City investment banker is free on bail after being arraigned on Friday on charges that he raped a woman he met at a nightclub on Long Island. Jason Lee, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, was initially arrested a month ago after the woman accused him of attacking her in a bathroom at a home he had rented in East Hampton, a summer resort town, with his wife. Lee, 37, left a courthouse in Riverhead after his arraignment without saying a word. He was hand in hand with his wife Alicia who appeared strained but the couple were wearing their wedding rings. A judge set his bail at $100,000. Lee's lawyer, Edward Burke Jr., told reporters his client is innocent. 'We have what is a rush to arrest my client, a rush to the grand jury and a rush to indict my client,' Burke said. 'My client is adamant that he did not do this and adamant that he did not perform these serious allegations upon this complainant at all.' When asked whether the sex between Lee and the woman was consensual, Burke said: 'Yes, it was.' Prosecutors said Lee was celebrating his birthday at a club in Wainscott when he invited the woman and her friends back to his rental home for an alleged 'naked pool party'. The woman said that once at the house, Lee undressed, forced his way into a bathroom and pinned her to the floor. Suffolk County District Attorney Tom Spota said the woman was treated at a hospital following the assault. He said she was from Ireland but was working in the U.S. at the time of the attack. She has since returned home, Spota said. Lee, who is managing director of the firm's equity capital markets group, is on a leave of absence from Goldman Sachs' equity capital markets department. He lives in Manhattan. At the time of the incident last month, police who arrived at the house reportedly found the banker cowering in his Range Rover. Restaurant: The group met at Georgica's restaurant and lounge, pictured, popular with the jetset summer crowd of East Hampton . It also emerged Lee's own friend, . Rene Duncan, called the police, believing one of the alleged victim's . friends had stolen a car from Lee's rental home. But . when police arrived, the young woman's brother drew a female officer . aside and led her into the house where his sobbing sister reported she . had been raped, according to The East Hampton Star. A . source told the newspaper that Lee then went to the driveway of the . $33,000-a-month summer home he was renting, got into his late model . Range Rover, which was dark with tinted windows, and hid. But officers . soon found him cowering inside, the source said. The . Star reported Lee and Duncan met the alleged victim, a foreign student, . and her friends at Georgica restaurant and lounge in Wainscott on . August 19, where the two men were celebrating Lee's 37th birthday. Scene: This is the house on Clover Leaf Lane in East Hampton, New York, where the sexual assault allegedly occurred .

With $12,000 cash in his backpack, an early morning motorbike ride to the jewellers and a big smile on his face, Matthew Camp was off to buy his girlfriend a special engagement ring. But that dream was shattered because unbeknown to him a faulty zip on his bag meant that for miles, his hard earned cash was streaming out behind him. And for fisherman Matthew Camp, the cash truly was the result of hard work, sweat and sacrifices. Good intentions: Matthew Camp planned to buy his girlfriend Tabitha Bohn an engagement ring with his recent paycheck from a good season as a scallop fisherman . After days and even weeks away at sea, aboard the scallop boat the FV Nancy Elizabeth, at last the boat had had a big haul. It was a welcome relief in a job which at times brings in nothing at all. When the ship docked on Sept. 9 in Cape May County, New Jersey, Mr Camp, 32, immediately cashed his check, stuffed the bills into his backpack and headed south on the Garden State Parkway at 8am. According to Philly.com, it wasn't until he reached Lund's Fisheries, close to his home in Lower Township, that the horror of what had happened hit him. Every hard-earned dollar was gone. His plans were ruined; he called his girlfriend Tabitha Bohn. He was 'sick to his stomach' Miss Bohn told Philly.com. 'This season had been good, finally. Last season had been bad and we were at our wits' end. Sometimes he can go out for a month and not even make a paycheck,' she told the news service. Mr Camp only realised all his hard-earned cash was gone after travelling south on his motorbike along the Garden State Parkway to Lund Fisheries . Mr Camp turned his motorbike around and retraced his tracks searching desperately for his money. Some luck, fortunately, was on his side, as a team of highway workers on a roadside project had scooped up $4,000 and handed it in to police. But the rest was gone, presumed taken by opportunist motorists. Mr . Camp, a father-of-four, had received a phone call from a person . claiming to a driver in a silver Dodge pickup, and claiming they had the . cash, Miss Bohn told Philly.com. But the couple weren't sure if it was a cruel prank. No money was handed in to the police. 'It can't possibly feel good to spend someone else's hard-earned money,' she said. His dream was shattered when the $12,000 cash for his scallops, which he stuffed into his backpack, fluttered away in the wind because of a faulty bag zip . As Mr Camp prepared to set off on another long fishing trip, his sister Michelle Godin spoke to the news service, and told them he was angry and embarrassed at what had happened. She stressed he was a hard-working, honest, family man who has to leave his loved ones for days on end for a dangerous job to make ends meet. New Jersey State Police have urged people to contact them with information.

A shop assistant who spent 30 minutes fending off a knife wielding woman trying to attack him has been branded a hero after refused to strike back at her - because he was raised to never 'hit a woman.' Michael Whybrow, 59, was cornered in his petrol station kiosk as drunk Anna Chambers, 29, lunged at him with an eight-inch blade. The cashier bravely grabbed hold of the knife slicing open his hands in a bid to protect both himself and his attacker. Scroll down for video . Courageous: Michael Whybrow who foiled an armed attack on his petrol station without harming the drunken would-be thief . Chambers leans menacingly over the counter brandishing her eight inch blade at the terrified shop assistant . Pathetic: Knife wielding Anna Chambers was drunk at the time of the attack and has now been jailed for six years, her defense said she didn't even need the money in the till . But when the weapon was cast to the side vicious Chambers smashed the top off a glass bottle and continued her onslaught. CCTV shows violent Chambers repeatedly leave the garage after being pushed away by Michael, before returning to attack him again. The cashier managed to dial 999 and left the phone off the hook in the hope the call handler would trace it. But while he waited for police to arrive he was forced to repeatedly defend himself against Chambers for half-an-hour, intentionally not harming her - despite her constant violence towards him. Chambers, who apparently became enraged by the death of her puppy, was arrested and has now been jailed for six years. Following the conviction grandfather-of-nine Mr Whybrow said he did not believe in hitting women. He said: 'She tried to jab me with the knife. I pressed the panic button under the desk and the button to lock both doors. 'I also called 999 on the phone and left it off the hook - hoping that the police would hear what was going on. 'Some people asked why didn't I just hit her but I was bought up not to hit a woman. Chambers was jailed at Canterbury Crown Court yesterday after admitting attempted robbery of the Murco petrol station, in Ashford, Kent, in February, and possession of a knife. Judge James O'Mahony, sentencing, said: 'I want to say just how brave he [Mr Whybrow} was and he acted in the most sensible way.

'He showed the other side of humanity and I strongly hope he will be treated with every consideration by his employers.' The court heard how Chambers had entered the petrol station with a scarf wrapped around her face at 4.50am on February 21. She approached the till and dived towards a stunned Mr Whybrow in a bid to empty the contents of his till. The father-of-three immediately pushed the panic button but had to defend himself as she repeatedly tried to stab him and get hold of the money while he waited for emergerncy services.

Confused: Once drunken Chambers realises her victim is bleeding she is overcome with remorse and bizarrely rushes to hand him paper towels . Caught: After 30 terrifying minutes police arrive at the petrol station and quickly apprehend Chambers in the shop, she was jailed for six years yesterday .

Caribbean dream: Scott Brown with his bride Rachel on their wedding day in September 2009 in the Dominican Repulic. She asked for a divorce on Christmas Day last year . After Scott Brown held his nerve to win £50,000 on Deal Or No Deal, he was determined that his estranged wife should not get a penny. But with only four months before the TV gameshow was screened and she found out about his windfall, the father-of-two knew he had to spend it fast. The 33-year-old sign manufacturer and fitter said he used £15,000 to clear all the debts he and his wife Rachel, 29, had from credit card bills, loans and bank overdrafts. After setting aside almost £2,000 to cover legal fees for his divorce, he bought clothing, toys and household items for their two young children. Mr Brown also used some cash to ‘live off’, having being signed off from work because of ‘depression’. But he admits he spent most of the rest on ‘having a good time’, including an iPad, a holiday in  Mexico and the outlay of £4,000 on a second-hand X-type Jaguar estate car. The final part of his winnings went days before his own August 21 deadline to pay for an electrician’s course, so he could start a new career. As it turned out, Mr Brown was right to suspect that his wife, who he says asked him for a divorce on Christmas Day last year when he allegedly found she had been having an affair with a truck driver she met over the internet, would want to cash in on his lucky break. As soon as the Channel 4 programme was broadcast, she went to court in a belated bid to ensure she received a share. The case went before a district judge at Doncaster County Court last Thursday, when Mr Brown was ordered to detail in writing how the money was spent; an injunction imposed days earlier ordering him not to spend his winnings – if any remained – was kept in place; and the case was adjourned. The couple, who are in the process of getting divorced, neither looked at or spoke to each other throughout the brief hearing. Outside court, Mr Brown told the Daily . Mail how the show, presented by Noel Edmonds, changed his life when he . was at his lowest ebb, saying:  ‘I was over the moon to have won that . amount. I was told Rachel could lay claim to it so I decided, “She is . not getting a penny”.’ Moment of triumph: Scott Brown appearing on Deal or No Deal . Host Noel Edmonds on Channel Four's Deal or No Deal, where contestants can win up to £250,000 . Mr Brown married customer services adviser Rachel in the Dominican Republic in September 2009. The couple already had one child, now aged six, and decided to have another baby, now 22 months old. The family moved to rent a bigger house near Doncaster but their debts began to mount. Mr Brown said his wife told him late last year she ‘didn’t love him any more’ and by the time he found out he was going on the gameshow in April, Mr Brown had moved out and was sleeping on the floor of his cramped parents’ house. He said he was ‘absolutely disgusted’ by his wife, saying: ‘How does she have the right to this money? My life has broken apart, I can’t see my kids every day any more and I have lost everything I have worked for over 11 years.’ Mrs Brown refused to comment. On Deal Or No Deal, contestants pick one of 22 sealed boxes containing hidden amounts of cash ranging from 1p to £250,000, then eliminate the other boxes one by one. Mr Brown gambled by turning down offers of £22,250 and £13,000 from the show’s mysterious ‘banker’ to ‘deal’ and quit the game, instead carrying on until the end to win the £50,000 in his box.","Scott Brown cleared £15,000 debts, spent £4,000 on a second-hand Jaguar and put £2,000 aside to pay for divorce legal fees .

Vodafone and O2 customers are now able to access high-speed 4G internet on their mobiles – but only if they own one of a handful of brand-new smartphones. The networks launched the service yesterday in a bid to rival EE, which introduced its 4G package last October. O2 has now switched on 4G in London, Leeds and Bradford. However Vodafone has so far only launched it in some parts of London ahead of its UK-wide roll-out. Vodafone will offer Premier League football and music downloads as part of its 4G packages. Customers will be able to choose from unlimited music downloads from Spotify or free Sky Sports, as part of the bundle. The firm launched its 4G service with a football match in Trafalgar Square (pictured) Consumers are still confused about the merits of 4G technology, a report suggests. One in five people think the high-speed broadband won't improve their current service and one in three say they do not need 4G, it found. A third of consumers also said they believe it would be too expensive to switch to the speedier services. Dominic Baliszewski, a telecoms expert at comparison site broadbandchoices.co.uk, said; 'More people are aware of 4G now compared to when it first launched last year, but most still do not understand the difference it will make to their experience as a mobile user.' 'Just like the black and white televisions of yesteryear, 3G is doing a perfectly good job for millions of customers - but 4G is the technicolour revolution.' The service lets users surf the web at speeds that are between five and seven times faster than 3G. But . experts last night warned customers to ‘think very carefully’ about the . cost of changing before making the switch. Both O2 and Vodafone . currently offer fewer than 15 mobiles that work with their 4G networks. This . means that most customers – including those who own the iPhone 5 – will . have to purchase a new phone before they can upgrade. Even with a compatible handset, existing customers will pay on average £5 a month extra for a 4G tariff. Millions will then be unable to access the 4G service in their hometown for months or even years. Ernest . Doku, a technology expert from comparison website USwitch.com, said: . ‘This could prove  very expensive for customers, so people need to . consider the extra costs. ‘You . need to ask if you can get 4G in your area and when will it arrive, as . well as how much you will need to spend to upgrade your phone to one . which is 4G-compatible. ‘A . lot of people will have to pay a few hundred quid to buy a new phone and . break their contract, even those with relatively new smartphones. ‘Lastly, you need to ask yourself if the more expensive tariff will be worth it. Not everyone will need faster internet.’ He added: ‘Naturally over time people will change to 4G but there is a lot to think about at the moment.’ The 4G system allows smartphones, tablets and laptops to surf the web around five times faster than over 3G, although Vodafone claims its network is, on average, six times faster. It launched the service with the help of ex Arsenal legends Ian Wright and Tony Adams as well as ex Spurs heroes Ledley King and Les Ferdinand . Vodafone spent £802 million when it bid for part of the mobile phone spectrum to provide 4G, while O2 spent £550m to buy a proportion of the lowest frequency spectrum. Les Ferdinand and Ian Wright are pictured launching Vodafone's 4G service . Subscribers to 4G can download a song in four seconds or post a photograph to a social networking site in six seconds. They . will also be able to watch films, videos and television straight from . the internet as easily and quickly as from a home computer. O2 . and Vodafone have pledged to have 4G network coverage in more cities by . the end of the year – including Birmingham, Coventry, Edinburgh, . Glasgow, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and . Sheffield. But they will still lag some way behind EE, which already offers their 4G service in 105 UK towns and cities. Telecoms . expert Dominic Baliszewski said now might not be the right time to . switch, but insisted 4G internet will soon start to grow in popularity. He . said: ‘Just like the black-and-white televisions of yesteryear, 3G is . doing a perfectly good job for millions of customers – but 4G is the . Technicolor revolution.’ O2 is launching in London, Leeds and Bradford with a further 10 cities including Liverpool and Newcastle expected to be connected by the end of the year. O2's tariffs start at £26 a month and come with 12 months free music when bought direct from O2 . EE, which was formed from the merger of Orange and T-Mobile, was the first company to offer a 4G network in the UK. EE . held the monopoly on the network because regulator Ofcom gave it . permission to use existing spectrum (1800MHz) that it already owned. Ofcom then held an auction for companies to bid to use other parts of the spectrum from 800MhZ to 2.6GHz. O2 purchased 800MHz lots and Vodafone won both 800MHz and 2.6GHz lots. For . the typical user, download speeds of initial 4G networks should be at . least five to seven times faster than those of existing 3G networks. In . July, EE announced it was doubling its 4G speeds for people in . Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Derby, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, . Liverpool, London, Manchester, Nottingham and Sheffield. The speed boost makes the network twice as fast as current average 4G speeds and 10 times as fast as 3G. Mobile . network Three has kicked off a price war earlier this week over the new . 4G service by announcing it will offer the super high-speed internet at . no extra cost. The firm’s . 1.5million customers will get 4G at the same price they pay for the . current 3G network, with packages of calls, texts and unlimited internet . from £15 a month. The Three deal will start in mid December, cashing in on Christmas handset sales. Vodafone's 4G tariffs start at £26 per month.

They judged it perfectly - as the summer drew to a close and windy weather started picking up, the waves were at their prime. After waiting for a huge swell, the playful mammal rushed to catch the curling water. Off and away, he rode it for 50 to 100 metres before disappearing beneath the foam. The clan of surfers have become obsessed with their new talent since they first discovered it last month. Instead of splashing around the water, they follow a strict routine of daily 'runs' that last for 30 minutes. Full time photographer and trained behavioural ecologist, Brad Hill, managed to capture the rare moment on camera on 22 August.

Google is bringing its digital wallet to the iPhone in its latest attempt to upstage Apple on its own popular device. Thursday's release of the Google Wallet app represents a challenge to the Passbook program that Apple has built into the iPhone's operating system. Both Google Wallet and Passbook allow iPhone users to store loyalty cards from some merchants and scan coupons offering discounts. This undated screenshot shows the Google Wallet application on a mobile device in New York . Google Wallet also allows its users to send money and make purchases on some mobile websites by storing a debit or credit card account on the app. Payment information can also be stored in Passbook. The arrival of Google Wallet on the iPhone comes a few days after a similar version was released to smartphones running on Google's Android software. Google gives away Android for free, a factor that has helped siphon sales away from the iPhone by enabling other smartphone makers to sell their devices at cheaper prices. About three out of every four smartphones sold during the first half of this year ran on Android software, according to the research firm Gartner Inc. In comparison, the iPhone had a 16 percent share of the worldwide market. New models of the Apple iPhone 5C are pictured. Google Wallet will compete with Apple's Passbook . The higher-priced iPhones tend to attract more affluent consumers who are more likely to spend money through their devices, one of the reasons that Google is eager to connect with Apple customers. Google has previously sought to outshine Apple's built-in iPhone apps with its digital maps and a mobile version of its Chrome browser. By getting people to use its services on as many devices as possible, Google hopes to make more money by selling more digital advertising.","Both Google Wallet and Passbook allow .

Stephen Phillips, 59, who was gunned down and murdered in Thailand, unwittingly paid for his own murder, said police . A retired rail worker was gunned down by hitmen after his young Thai wife used his money to pay professionals to carry out the kill, say police. Stephen Phillips, 59, from Torquay, Devon, was shot dead last month as he rode his Honda motorbike near his home in the remote village of Baan Phai, about 250 miles north-east of Bangkok. Mr Phillips' 29-year-old wife Wilaiwan, and two Thai men, one believed to be her Thai-Chinese lover, have been charged by police with conspiracy to murder. Officers think the former Network Rail supervisor may have unwittingly given his wife the money to pay for his own murder. The hitmen shot Mr Phillips in the abdomen and both legs before a final bullet was fired at his head - a shooting which shows all the hallmarks of a classic 'hit'. It is believed Mr Phillips had recently taken out a £200,000 life insurance policy and almost £12,000 had been withdrawn from his bank account in the weeks leading up to the shooting, it was reported in The Sun. However, Wilaiwan, whom Mr Phillips met on the internet, has denied any involvement in her husband's death and said the couple had been cheated out of £7,000 by underworld mobsters in an investment scam. She told police: 'These men were not local. They travel from province to province and cheat everyone. 'My husband was angry with me. He said he was going to meet him.' However, . officers became suspicious of her behaviour at Mr Phillips' funeral, . where she was said to be 'inappropriately dressed' for a cremation. According to Andrew Drummond, . friends who lived near Mr Phillips in Thailand said he was nicknamed . 'the Wounded Buffalo' because of his 'gullible and naive' nature. Friends reportedly described Mr Phillips as 'naive and gullible' but said he loved his life in Thailand . Rescue Workers at the scene of the murder of Mr Phillips, who was gunned down by hired hitmen while he was riding his motorbike . A friend of his 81-yr-old mother in Manchester said:'He was back in the UK earlier this year and said he was not happy with his marriage. 'He had £12,000 in one bank account which he reported recently had been reduced to £300 by his wife. 'He was a quiet unassuming person. Apart from his marriage he loved the life in Thailand.' Mr Phillips moved to the South-East Asian country after taking early retirement and got married two and a half years ago in a Buddhist ceremony. Thai police did not comment on Wilaiwan's story but a Khon Kaen Police spokesman said: 'The murder investigation is ongoing and no suspects have been ruled out. 'We expect to make an arrest within a week. Because a foreigner has been killed extra emphasis has been put on the investigation. 'The driver has confessed and we know the identify of the gunmen.'

A part-time municipal judge has been ordered by the New Jersey Supreme Court to stop moonlighting as a stand-up comedian if he wants to keep his job as a judge. Vince Sicari, 44, has been working as a comedian and actor in New York City comedy clubs and in TV appearances under his stage name Vince August. 'The judge's acting and comedy career is incompatible with the Code of Judicial Conduct and therefore he may not serve as a municipal court judge while continuing with that career,' the court wrote in a unanimous 7-0 opinion. Scroll down for video . Vince A. Sicari, a South Hackensack, N.J., Municipal Judge, seen performing at Carolines on Broadway comedy club in New York in February 2013 . Sicari said in an email that he would respond to the decision later today. Sicari has carved out a career as a stand-up comic and actor, appearing on network television, comedy clubs and as a warm-up for Comedy Central audiences. He's also a part-time municipal judge in South Hackensack, where he handles things like traffic ticket cases and disorderly persons offenses. Several justices had questioned whether the public had the ability to separate Sicari's position as a judge from roles he has played on the ABC hidden camera show What Would You Do? in which he has portrayed homophobic and racist characters. That dilemma played a central role in Thursday's ruling, as the justices noted that someone tuning into the show might not know that actors were used in the sketches. They applied the same standard for Sicari's stand-up performances. 'In the course of his routines, Sicari has demeaned certain people based on national origin and religion and has revealed his political leanings,' according to the court's opinion. New Jersey's Supreme Court ordered Sicari, a part-time municipal judge, to step down if he wants to continue as a comedian . 'The court cannot ignore the distinct possibility that a person who has heard a routine founded on humor disparaging certain ethnic groups and religions will not be able to readily accept that the judge before whom he or she appears can maintain the objectivity and impartiality that must govern all municipal court proceedings.' A state ethics board recommended in 2008 that Sicari quit his comedy work, expressing concern over his character depictions on the ABC reality show and the potential content of his sketches. Sicari appealed the ruling to the state's highest court, which heard arguments in February. Sicari's attorney, E. Drew Britcher, insisted at the time that his client never cracked wise on the bench and never let on that he moonlighted as a comic. Superior Court Judge Daniel J. Mecca administers the oath of Office to Municipal Court Judge Vincenzo A. Sicari (left) in 2008 . In his comedy routine, Britcher added, Sicari refrained from jokes about the legal profession and never divulged his judicial job. An attorney for the state attorney general's office, Kim D. Ringler, argued against Sicari being allowed to hold both jobs, saying municipal judges represent the most frequent contact the public has with the justice system. Some of the characters Sicari has depicted could confuse the public and reflect badly on the judiciary, she argued. Sicari, who is a member of the Screen Actors Guild and other professional performers' unions, has said his entertainment work entitles him to health benefits and earns him more than his $13,000-a-year part-time judge salary. He said during the Supreme Court arguments in February that he was equally passionate about both his jobs.","Vince Sicari says he earns more from entertainment work than his $13,000 part-time judge salary .

It may be in the same retail group as high-fashion Meccas Topshop and Miss Selfridge but for years BHS has been languishing in the style stakes - until it unveiled its slick new autumn collection. In an exclusive first look at the department store's new advert, it is clear that BHS is adamant to give the most glamorous of its high street competitors a run for their money.

Jonas . said: 'I'm genuinely excited about working with Joint on the BHS . campaign which celebrates British women and inspires them to look good . in great fashion from a great British company.' They're back! BHS have had a style overhaul and unveiled a fresh and slick new A/W13 collection (Coat £65, blouse £22, skirt £26, croc clutch £20, leather gloves £18) Wearable: The store hope their new collection evokes simplicity, elegance and sophistication (L-belted coat £65, bag £28, R- biker jacket £55, roll neck £10, jeans £22) The new range is designed to evoke 'simplicity, elegance and sophistication' and the store say they hope to offer 'modern-day ladylike glamour combined with structured fits and clean lines'. And all with a purse-friendly price tag. 'BHS Womenswear AW13 is a measured mix of . clever pieces and wardrobe essentials that have created a very wearable . and confident collection designed to suit every woman,' say the store. Easy to wear monochrome is key and comes in the form of . stripes, geometrical prints, florals and bold mono-blocking.

Fashion forward: Monochrome and checks are key to the collection and come in the form of stripes, geometrical prints and bold mono-blocking (L- jumper £28, bag £28, R- pyjama set £28) In a nod to Chanel's Highland trend, classic shapes have been updated with tweed, textured knits, faux leather trimming, quilting and jacquard. And in another homage to high fashion the brand has used super chic model Susannah, who bares a striking resemblance to It girl Cara Delevingne, to showcase the collection. Key looks for the new season are oversized knits or box tops worn with leather or print pencil skirts and the collection also serves up tweed coats, shift dresses and tunics. BHS have also taken note of the sports luxe trend, as championed by Rihanna, Rita Ora and Cara Delevingne, and introduced the style with silk-mix print bomber jackets and a quilted bomber teamed peg-leg trousers. Comfort and style: there are plenty of cosy knits, black jeans and nude heels in the new collection, which starts at £10 (Jumper £25, trousers £22) On trend: Classic shapes have been updated with tweed, textured knits, faux leather trimming, quilting and jacquard (L-tunic £35, roll neck £10, R-textured coat £65, roll neck £10, trousers £22) For outerwear, there are tweed and leather biker jackets, as well as khaki long jackets, which can be teamed with a roll neck and the boyfriend jean.

But for those looking to add a tougher edge, there's sturdy biker boots, jewel coloured suede shoe boots and brogues. BHS A/W13 is available in-store and online. Familiar face: BHS's model, Susannah (left) and her bushy eyebrows bear an uncanny resemblance to model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne (right) BHS began life in the 1970s . and was acquired by Sir Philip Green in 2002 and incorporated into the . Arcadia group in 2009. In early 2006, Philip considered selling the store and contacted rivals including Asda and Debenhams with no success. In 2010, BHS gave itself a brand . overhaul by changing its logo, resurrecting the uppercase form of the . abbreviation, launching an e-commerce website and a new store design. Richard Price is current CEO. BHS has 179 stores nationwide and it has a rolling programme to modernise them; about a quarter of the stores are now in the new formats. BHS has 18 dedicated Home stores across the country. BHS.co.uk offers over 30,000 products with on-line exclusives. BHS is expanding its international portfolio, currently at 90 stores. Pyjama set £28 . It might have been given a glamorous new makeover but BHS has still kept its eye on the retail prize: the 30something professional woman with a bit of money to spend. Like M&S, who has recently turned around its womenswear offering, the brand has listened to its customers and delivered wearable pieces that can be slotted in to an existing wardrobe (complete with longer hemlines and sleeves) rather than chasing the trends and trying to compete with 'younger' brands like Topshop or Primark. Interest comes in flashes of design detail rather than a too-short skirt or plunging neckline and while there is a nod to successful trends from the last few seasons (pyjamas as outerwear, pictured right, were first seen in loud prints on the Stella McCartney S/S '12 catwalk) the success of this collection lies in its simplicity: key pieces in easy-to-wear colours that will update a look without breaking the bank. Favourite pieces include the Crombie-style coat which I'll be wearing with skinny leather trousers and the biker jacket worn with a 60s style polo neck.","High street store makes a comeback with fashionable new collection .

Shocked: Dr Taufig Sattar was charged nearly £160 by Ryanair to change his flight after being told his family may have died in a fire . Surgeon Muhammad Taufiq Sattar had to pay nearly £160 to change his regular evening Ryanair flight to the UK to an earlier one moments after he was told it was likely his family were dead. The 52-year-old flew over to see his family in Leicester almost every week and had his return ticket booked to travel last Friday as usual. But after being woken and told at 3am last Friday that his family’s house was on fire, he immediately changed his plans deciding he needed to get over to the UK as soon as possible. Arriving in Dublin Airport at around 5.30am, and just moments after Leicester Police had confirmed by phone that no member of his family had managed to escape the blaze, he approached the Ryanair check-in desk to see if he could change his ticket. Distraught, and with tears streaming down his face, he explained why he had to change his flight from 9.40pm to East Midlands Airport in Leicester later in the day so he could catch the 6.30am flight to Birmingham instead. But he was told he would have to buy a new ticket. The stunned neurosurgeon produced his credit card and was promptly charged €187.46 - approximately £158 - for a one-way ticket to Birmingham. In his first interview since returning to his west Dublin home in Castleknock on Wednesday night, he told the Irish Daily Mail: ‘I don’t want to make a big deal about it but it did shock me. I really did not expect them to charge me. ‘I thought, given the circumstances, they might just let me transfer flights, as I had already paid for a return fare.’ Last night, Ryanair issued a brief statement after receiving questions about the matter from the Irish Daily Mail. Tragedy: Bilal Taufiq Sattar (left)  and his brother Jamal (right) bothdied with their mother Shehnila in the Leicester house fire in the early hours last Friday . In a statement, the airline said: ‘Ryanair offers its sincere condolences to Dr Sattar and confirmed that in the circumstances it will provide a full refund of any monies paid last Friday.’ Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary confirmed a letter of condolence had been sent to Dr Al Sattar, along with a an apology for the way the budget airline had handled the situation. 'I think you have to make exceptions in cases like that and we made an exception last night when we became aware of it,' Mr O’Leary said. 'We want to respond sensitively to these cases.' Mr O’Leary added Dr Al Sattar had been refunded the extra charge and said that the booking change was handled according to the airline’s policy, which staff are told to implement without exception or variation. Dr Taufiq Sattar welcomed news last night a teenager has been charged with four counts of murder in relation to the deaths of his family. Leicester Police announced last night that there was ‘sufficient evidence’ to charge the 18-year-old male and that it was ‘in the public interest for a prosecution to take place’. The accused is expected to appear at Leicester Magistrates’ Court today. The charges against him follow the arrest of six people in connection with the fire at Dr Taufiq’s home in Leicester last Friday morning. All but one of the six had been previously released without charge. Police and firefighters were called to the building in the Spinney Hills area of Leicester at about 12.35am on Friday last week. A teenager has been arrested in connection with the fire . Shehnila Taufiq, 47, daughter Zainab, 19, and sons Bilal, 17, and Jamal, 15, all tragically perished in the blaze, which started around 12.30am. Although 52-year-old Dr Taufiq Sattar lives in Dublin, he visited his family three Fridays in every month. They had moved to Leicester five years ago to complete Islamic studies. But they had been due to all return to Ireland in the next few months to teach at a new Islamic education centre he purchased recently. Dr Sattar said: ‘I do not want to make any comment whatsoever about the investigation. ‘But I am very happy that there has been a major development and I hope that this means I might be able to have my family’s bodies returned to me for burial.’ Steve Chappell, Chief Crown Prosecutor at Crown Prosecution Service East Midlands said: 'The evidence has been reviewed by a Crown Advocate from the CPS East Midlands Complex Casework Unit, who has decided that there is sufficient evidence to charge and that it is in the public interest for a prosecution to take place.’ Apology: Ryanair offered its 'sincere condolences' and a full refund to Dr Sattar .

McGruff the Crime Dog teaches kids to 'take a bite out of crime' but what happens when the criminal takes a bite out of you? That's what lawyer Jonathan Damon encountered when he caught 24-year-old Mikayla Hull trying to make off with a 75-year-old's purse Tuesday. The victim, Evelyn Searl, was eating at a restaurant in Grand Rapids, Michigan with her daughter when Hull rode up on her bike and swiped the bag. Scroll down for video . Take a bite out of crime: 24-year-old purse-snatching suspect Mikayla Hull is caught on camera biting the man straddling her, a lawyer named Jonathan Damon . Searl ran after her but tripped and fell on her face. Before Hull could get away, three men apprehended her and pinned her to the ground, with Mr Damon straddling her so she couldn't get up while they waited for police. Hull's detainment by the citizen arresters was caught on camera by a passing Grand Rapids Press reporter. The video picks up after Hull has been pinned to the ground, and she starts asking to be rolled over and have her hands put behind her back instead of being straddled. Ms Searl is also captured laying on the ground after slipping and falling. Victim: 75-year-old Evelyn Searl, on the ground in blue, attempted to chase Hull but fell on her face. When paramedics arrived, they determined she was uninjured . It seems that witnesses believed that Hull hit Ms Searl, and while she admitted to taking the bag, Hull tells Mr Damon that she didn't touch the woman. 'Dude she's rich, she's eating at a restaurant,' Hull said. 'I didn't break her nose. I snatched her purse. It was sitting on the table. I swear to god I wouldn't hit her.' Hull continues to ask to be turned over, but the men refuse and she starts to wiggle in an attempt to break free. 'You're struggling you should not be struggling because you're going to get hurt,' Mr Damon warns. 'Alright, you asked for it,' he says before she bites him in the arm. 'You asked for it': Mr Damon gives out a word of warning before Hull starts to bite . Bitten: Hull begins to bite Mr Damon when he refuses to let her flip over onto her back . Punches: After she starts biting him, Mr Damon starts to punch her in the face. The man on the left eventually intervenes telling him to stop . Once Hull starts biting, Mr Damon starts punching her in the face until one of the other men tells him to stop. 'You just assaulted me fool,' she said. After Hull was taken into custody by police, Mr Damon spoke with the reporter and seemed to be confused about Hull's gender, referring to her as a 'he' though he can clearly be heard in the video using 'she'. Arrested: Police say Hull will be charged with larceny from a person and assault . 'I was raised to never hit a girl,' he told the Press. 'I was raised at a time when you had no concept of a girl doing that. In the 1950s, girls didn't snatch purses. They wore petticoats.' While Mr Damon was praised by the daughter of the victim, he's also received criticism on the web for punching a woman. 'I know I'm a bleeding heart and all that, but him slugging [the] girl in the head probably could've been avoided. The cops sure wouldn't have gotten away with it,' one commenter wrote. After the incident he went to the hospital to treat the bite wound, which he says broke skin. Mr Damon received a tetanus shot and a prescription for antibiotics. Doctors told him to return if the wound becomes infected. Hull was taken into custody and a police spokesman said she will be charged with larceny from a person and aggravated assault. Police said they would not charge Mr Damon for hitting Hull. 'I don't think a crime was committed by him,' said Grand Rapids Police Lt Pete McWatters. 'To the contrary, he was defending himself.' Paramedics examined Ms Searl on the scene and determined she was uninjured. Her daughter, Samantha Searl, posted a comment on MLive.com about the incident: . 'We want to make sure that everyone knows that she WAS NOT HIT by the thief, but FELL chasing after her. We are very thankful for all those who helped make a citizens arrest and, hopefully, end the thief's career.'","Evelyn Searl, 75, was eating at a restaurant in Grand Rapids, Michigan with her daughter when 24-year-old Mikayla Hull rode up on her bike and snatched her purse off the table .

They and animal lovers around Germany had been waiting eagerly for the birth of the new baby. The zoo is home to four cows and a bull elephant. Its enclosure has an outdoor area of 3,000 square metres and a swimming pool for African elephant bull Abu and the elephants Mafuta, Tana, Bibi and her calf Panya. As elephants are so tactile and sociable, a mother rejecting their newborn appears very unusual. Typically, an expecting mother will seek out another female elephant in her herd who will help her when she gives birth and offer her protection. The phenomenon could be linked to the mother suspecting the calf had a deformity or just the psychological distress of labour. The gruesome incident echoed a similar . one in China last week, when zookeepers were forced to intervene after a female . elephant attempted to stamp her calf to death shortly after he was born. The female elephant had stepped on baby Zhuangzhuang almost immediately after giving birth at a Chinese zoo on August 30. Zoo keepers initially thought it was an . accident. They removed the calf to treat his injuries and returned him . to his mother two hours later - but she started to stamp on him again. Keepers drove her off and took the little elephant away. The . rejected calf then reportedly cried for five hours as staff at the . Shendiaoshan Wild Animal Natural Reserve Area, in Rongcheng, Shandong . province, tried to comfort him. To be rejected at birth causes an elephant extreme psychological distress, wildlife trusts say. Elephants find it extremely important to be part of a family group, and require intimacy, company and comfort to be stable. Bibi became distressed after giving birth to the calf and, before keepers could intervene, stamped on it . Keepers had not expected any trouble as Bibi was an experienced mother and the youngster was her third calf . Psychological . grief can trigger life threatening problems such as diarrheoa in infant . elephants, who are extremely fragile during their milk dependency period, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust warns. They are tactile and sensitive, and require a human adoptive family who will provide them with around-the-clock care and attention. Orphan elephants are normally reintroduced into the wild once they are grown and deemed ready to successfully integrate with a herd. The baby elephant who cried after his mother's vicious attack touched the hearts of millions who saw his anguish on video. He is now making good progress and has been adopted by a keeper.","New mother Bibi stomped on her newborn baby at a zoo in Halle, Germany .

Petersen, 49, a biotech executive from California, has been charged in the double shooting of his wife's brother and his former business partner . A biotechnology executive from California has been arrested after police say he shot his estranged wife's brother and a former business associate in an early morning rampage. Hans A. Petersen, 49, of La Jolla, was apprehended Wednesday after he was subdued with a blow to the head during a scuffle with one of the victims. The two victims, a cancer researcher and a fourth-generation real estate investor, were taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla to be treated for gunshot wounds. Both men are expected to recover. Mr Petersen, the CEO of the genome data analysis company Bays Four Corp, was treated for head injuries and charged with attempted homicide, shooting into an occupied building and burglary. He was ordered held without bail. The incident started at around 3am when investigators say Peterson opened fire on a home in the 5700 block of Waverly Drive, wounding 53-year-old Steve Dowdy. Dowdy, a highly regarded biologist and professor at University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, was struck in his lower back after he was awakened by gunfire coming from his backyard. Just before 7am, more gunshots rang out about half a mile from the site of the first shooting. Police officers who responded to the scene in the 1400 block of Cottontail Lane discovered 43-year-old Ron Fletcher with a gunshot wound to the abdomen. Next to Fletcher police found his alleged assailant and estranged brother-in-law, Hans Petersen, nursing a head wound. Scroll down for videos . Victims: Police say Petersen shot his ex-business partner and cancer researcher Steve Dowdy (left), and his estranged brother-in-law and real estate broker Ron Fletcher (right) Ambush: Petersen allegedly opened fire on Dowdy's La Jolla home, striking him in the torso . Second attack: The 49-year-old suspect allegedly broke into Fletcher's home half a mile away from the first crime scene and shot him in the abdomen . Fletcher told police that his relative had broken into his home after smashing a window with a rock and shot him. UTSanDiego.com reported that even though the 43-year-old real estate broker was wounded, he was able to wrestle the .45 caliber gun from Petersen’s hands and knock him over the head with it, according to police. Mr Petersen has been going through an acrimonious divorce with his wife, Bonnie, who is Fletcher's sister. According to court documents, the 49-year-old executive held a grudge against his brother-in-law, who was handling the sale of his home, accusing the realtor of accepting offers on his behalf without consulting him. Bonnie Fletcher told 10News Thursday that her soon-to-be former spouse turned abusive towards the end of their 12-year marriage, and she is convinced that during Wednesday's shooting spree he was searching for her. Miss Fletcher described her husband as 'super smart' and 'wonderful', but said that about two years ago, he became violent after he stopped taking medication prescribed to him since his 1989 sky diving accident, in which he suffered head trauma. End of rampage: Petersen is pictured being wheeled on a gurney after Fletcher knocked him over the head with his own gun to subdue him . The estranged wife said she became fearful of Petersen and filed for a restraining order, citing two separate incidents in which her husband allegedly hit her in the face while she was driving and put her in a chokehold. Estranged wife: Bonnie Fletcher, who had been married to Petersen for 12 years, believes that her estranged husband was actually after her when he shot her brother . The temporary order of protection expired in January. The couple’s divorce is currently in the process of being finalized. Miss Fletcher has spent the past year staying with friends so her husband could not track her down and taking self-defense classes. The woman believes that had she been at her brother’s house Wednesday, Petersen would have killed her. Following the shooting incident, a judge granted Bonnie Fletcher and her family a restraining order against Petersen. Hans Petersen also has had a long relationship with the second victim, Steve Dowdy, who used to be his business partner and neighbor. The two men had invested money together in Traversa Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the treatment of ovarian cancer, leukaemia and glioblastoma, which filed for bankruptcy last year. Petersen, a graduate of University of San Diego, served as a postdoctoral researcher in Dowdy's lab, and the two worked together on ways to deliver drugs that target tumors without damaging healthy cells. NBC San Diego reported that the two former colleagues had a falling out over the failure of their joint business venture and were involved in a lawsuit. According to the suspect's wife, Petersen blamed Mr Dowdy for his downfall because he had fired him, NBC San Diego reported.

Ms Dexter said: ‘The very next day I checked iCloud - where all my contacts were stored - and noticed something funny in the notes section. A shopping list in Italian! I called the police immediately but they said unless I knew where the phone was, there was nothing they could do and this was not enough to go on.’ However, the trail warmed up just recently when Ms Dexter received a new iPhone and connected to iCloud again. The batch of photos featuring complete strangers had been streamed to it, along with several new phone numbers. One number was labelled as Mio Numero Nuovo!, Italian for ‘my new number’ – and Ms Dexter decided to call it. Someone answered, but promptly hung up. MailOnline also rang this number, but again, the person who answered quickly ended the call.

On trial: Amanda Hutton faces manslaughter charges after her son Hamzah Khan's decomposed body was found at home 21 months after his death . A mother starved her son to death and then lived with his mummified corpse for almost two years, a court has heard. Amanda Hutton, 43, kept the tiny corpse of four-year-old Hamzah Khan in a cot in her bedroom after he died of malnutrition. His growth had been so stunted that he was still wearing a baby-gro meant for an infant six to nine months old when he was found. Bradford Crown Court heard his mother went on with her life while his body decomposed. Within hours of Hamzah’s death, she ordered a pizza – and continued to claim child benefit in his name. Hutton is on trial accused of his manslaughter by gross negligence on two grounds – failing to feed her son adequately and failing to seek medical help for him when it was needed. She denies the charge. Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, said: ‘How had a child starved to death in 21st century England? ‘The prosecution case is simple – Amanda Hutton failed to provide her child with the nourishment that he needed to survive and, in so failing, she killed him. Hamzah’s growth had been stunted because he was malnourished over a lengthy period and that state of affairs had resulted in his death. In short, he starved to death.’ Mr Greaney said that after Hamzah’s death on December 15, 2009, former care assistant Hutton placed him in his cot beside a teddy. The body was only found on September 21, 2011, when two PCSOs visited her home in Crofton Road, Bradford, to investigate complaints of dirty nappies thrown into a neighbour’s garden.

Mr Greaney said the house had ‘overwhelming conditions of squalor’ with piles of rubbish, faeces, rotting matter and flies. He . added: ‘Furthermore, in the bedroom of Amanda Hutton a police officer . found the mummified corpse of a child. That child was Hamzah Khan, who . had been born over six years earlier.’ The . prosecutor alleged that Hamzah was often locked in his room by Hutton, . who he said was an alcoholic and cannabis smoker.He said that in police . interviews Hutton said Hamzah had become very ill on December 14, 2009.

The active search for a 19-year-old student who has been missing for nearly three weeks after his crashed SUV was found abandoned on a California road, has been called off. Bryce Laspisa's family last heard from the teenager in the early hours of August 30, when he called his mother saying he was too tired to drive. His car was found on its side, with the rear window smashed but the teenager's cell phone and wallet were still inside. But there has been no trace of Bryce. Missing: Bryce Laspisa has been missing since August 30 . Family members and Bryce's girlfriend, Kim Sly, have been helping search efforts, rallying volunteers to spread flyers and help them hike remote trails in the hope that the red-haired teenager will be found. Police have also taken part in an extensive search, checking the surrounding area and lake, as well as searching from the air. However, three weeks on Californian authorities have announced that their active search has been called off. 'It’s a tragedy he has not been found and the unknowns that go along with that. Frankly, it breaks our hearts too,' Los Angeles County sheriff's Captain, Mike Parker, said. Police will now rely on routine patrols and following up any new leads, according to the Los Angeles Times. Bryce's uncle, who has helped arrange . the family's search, made an emotional plea to his nephew to get in . touch last week. 'Make a call, have somebody make contact. Whatever it is, we'll work through it,' Glenn David said on ABC 7. Hope: Bryce with his parents, Karen and Michael Laspisa . Distinctive: The 19-year-old has a large tattoo on his left shoulder which could help identify him . Appeal: The teenager's family have pleaded with him to get in touch . In the initial search a burned body believed to be Bryce was found in the lake, but tests showed it actually belonged to a 35-year-old man named Lamondre Deon Miles. Three people have since been arrested over the death of Mr Miles, who was found burned and with bullet wounds. Bryce had been heading back to his Laguna Niguel home from the Sacramento area when he went missing, KTLA5 reported. It was thought that he had been involved in a crash that perhaps left him disorientated, confused or embarrassed, and that he then wandered off into the wilderness. According to an update earlier this week, posted by his parents on a Facebook page set up to find the teenager, evidence suggests Bryce left the recreation area near to where his car was found down an embankment. 'No matter what the circumstances of Bryce’s disappearance, the detectives are still working the case and will continue to follow up on any leads they receive,' the family said in the post. The Facebook page is filled with people volunteering to join the search for Bryce, or distribute flyers in the hope the 5ft 11in teenager, who has a large, distinctive tattoo on his left arm, will be spotted. Missed: Bryce with girlfriend Kim Sly who is helping search for him . Even a psychic left a comment on the page, with directions for where she believed he could be found. With no clear idea of where the teenager could be, search efforts have included trails around the lake area, homeless shelters and hospitals. Local stores and coffee shops have also tried to help, by allowing volunteers to meet and use their facilities as they coordinate their search.","19-year-old Bryce Laspisa has been missing since August 30 .

The radio station which allowed two of its DJs to prank call the Duchess of Cambridge's hospital has suspended all advertising on its shows. Radio network Austereo announced it had suspended all advertising on 2Day FM following a number of high-profile advertiser boycotts. Major firms such as Telstra, Coles and Lexus Australia had already pulled their advertising campaigns following the death of 46-year-old nurse Jacintha Saldanha. Loss: The radio station which allowed two of its DJs to prank call the Duchess of Cambridge's hospital has suspended all advertising on its shows. 2day FM radio hosts Mel Greig, left, and Michael Christian, right, are pictured . It is believed that other large companies including Woolworths and Optus . were also considering withdrawing their advertisements. According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Sandy Kaye, a spokeswoman for Austereo, said: 'We have pulled advertising on 2Day FM . indefinitely.' The decision means that no advertising will run on the station from Saturday afternoon until at least Monday. When asked how much the loss of advertising might cost, Ms Kaye added that money was 'not important right now ... [the] focus is on all people . concerned first and foremost'. The advertising has been pulled until Monday at least with Ms Kaye saying the management at the station were more concerned with the welfare of DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian . Mrs Saldanha was found dead on Friday morning. It was just three days after the 46-year-old nurse had transferred a hoax call from Greig and Christian who obtained intimate details about the Duchess of Cambridge while she was staying at King Edward VII hospital. Tragic: The grieving husband of nurse Jacintha Saldanha who died in a suspected suicide has told of his devastation at her death. She is pictured centre, believed to be with her two children . Since then the radio station has faced global outrage and come under sustained abuse online. TMZ reported that Lexus Australia became the latest advertiser to axe all of its advertising from the radio station. A spokesman for the car giant said it had pulled its media campaign because of the 'current situation'. It is believed the firm pulled advertising from the station last year following a different incident. The new campaign, which began on November 1, was the first time the firm had advertised with the station since the previous incident. The telephone giant Telstra had earlier joined a list of companies removing their advertising from the radio station. The station's owner was forced to pull advertising over panic from advertisers. Facing the media; Southern Cross Austereo CEO Rhys Holleran came out in defence of the DJs behind the prank call to Kate Middleton's hospital . Yesterday, King Edward VII hospital said they it written a letter of complaint to the Australian radio station's parent company about the 'truly appalling' prank. The hospital's chairman Lord Glenarthur said he wanted to 'protest' against the 'extremely foolish' gag which he branded 'truly appalling'. Lord Glenarthur said Mrs Saldanha's death was 'tragic beyond words'. His letter to Southern Cross Austereo said the immediate consequence of the station's 'premeditated and ill-considered actions' led to the 'humiliation' of Ms Saldanha and another nurse. 'I appreciate that you cannot undo the damage which has been done but I would urge you to take steps to ensure that such an incident could never be repeated,' it added. Nurse Jacintha Saldanha, 46, died in an apparent suicide after she transferred a hoax call from Australian DJs who retrieved sensitive information about Kate Middleton while in hospital . The boss of the radio company at the centre of the royal hoax call yesterday refused to sack the DJs behind the stunt and painted them as victims. 2DayFM presenters Greig and Christian were taken off air after it emerged Ms Saldanha - who took their prank call at Kate Middleton's hospital - had died in a suspected suicide. The mother of two had been manning the hospital switchboard when the Australian hoaxers called and she transferred the call to the Duchess of Cambridge's ward. Rhys Holleran, the chief executive of Southern Cross Austereo, which owns the station, said the presenters were 'completely shattered' and had been offered counselling. Mr Holleran told a press conference in Melbourne that the primary concern was for the family of Jacintha Saldanha, whose body was found yards from the King Edward VII Hospital. He said: 'I spoke to both presenters early this morning and it's fair to say they are completely shattered. 'These people aren't machines, they're human beings. What happened is incredibly tragic and we’re deeply saddened and we’re incredibly affected by that.’ He added: 'I think prank calls as a craft in radio have been going for decades and decades and are not just part of one radio station or network or country. 'No-one could have reasonably foreseen what ended up being an incredibly tragic day.' Mr Holleran declined to reveal who had dreamed up the prank call but said: ‘These things are often done collaboratively.' Co-hosts: The DJ duo has been suspended from the Sydney-based station . A source confirmed that 2DayFM’s lawyers had listened to audio of the entire call and had given it clearance to go to air. Mr Holleran said it was ‘a bit early’ to be drawing conclusions from what was really a ‘deeply tragic matter.’ He added: ‘I don’t think anyone could have reasonably foreseen that this was going to be a result.'","Radio network Austereo has suspended all advertising on 2DayFM .

Mind over metal: Bands such as these are useless to arthritis sufferers, according to a new study . Copper and magnetic bracelets worn to help relieve the crippling pain of arthritis are useless, scientists say. The healing effect that some users report is no different when wearing wrist straps made of any other material, according to the first scientific study into the treatment. Magnetic and copper bracelets are said to help a variety of ailments, including the chronic joint pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal disorders. Manufacturers of the bracelets, which cost between £30 and £50, suggest these conditions can be alleviated by rebalancing the body’s magnetic field or topping up depleted copper levels through the skin. However, the research shows they were no better than a wrist strap that was not magnetic or did not contain copper. Although previous research has cast doubt on the effectiveness of the bands, the latest trial, by York University, is the first scientific study of its kind. It studied the use of copper bracelets and magnetic wrist straps for pain management in rheumatoid arthritis. 'Devices such as these provide a placebo effect for users who believe in them,' said Dr Stewart Richmond, a research fellow in the Department of Health Sciences at York, who led the study. 'People normally begin wearing them during a flare-up period, and then, as their symptoms subside naturally over time, they confuse this with a therapeutic effect. 'Pain varies greatly over time in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, and the way we perceive pain can be altered significantly by the power of the mind.' Seventy arthritis patients with active symptoms, aged between 33 and 79, each wore four different devices over five months, reporting on their pain and medication use throughout the study, which was published in the science journal Plos One. Placebo: Scientists say that arthritis sufferers often mistakenly think that when pain subsides naturally after a flare-up, it is because of the magnetic bands . They also provided blood samples in order to monitor any changes in inflammation levels. Dr Richmond said: 'People may be better off saving their money, or spending it on other complementary interventions such as dietary fish oils for example, which have far better evidence for effectiveness. 'Warning people who suspect they may have rheumatoid arthritis to consult their GP and seek early medical treatment, rather than placing faith in such devices, is also important in helping to avoid long-term joint damage resulting from uncontrolled inflammation.' His report concluded: 'The results of this trial fail to provide any support for belief in the anti-inflammatory effects of magnetic wrist straps and copper bracelets.'","York University scientists tested a range of devices on 70 arthritis sufferers .

However, Ms Brunton believes the double diagnosis may have actually saved Chad’s life because the family recognised his symptoms from Tilly, enabling him to have an early scan. ‘Chad started complaining about headaches and having too much air in his head and it was like deja vu,’ said Ms Brunton from St Albans, Hertfordshire. ‘People told me that lightning never strikes twice and there was no way he could have a brain tumour too, but I recognised the signs. ‘He had the MRI scan and it was absolutely gut-wrenching to be given the news, but if I hadn’t gone through it with Tilly I wouldn’t have noticed the signs and two months later it may have been too late.’ Chad was diagnosed with a malignant tumour in May after complaining about headaches and feeling sick, whilst Tilly had a benign brain tumour five years ago. Both siblings suffered with sickness and headaches, which were so bad they would scream in pain. Tilly was diagnosed after develop nausea and headaches. She also started to sleep for up to 14 hours a day, experienced double vision and struggled to walk . Tilly (pictured after her operation) said that doctors initially thought she was suffering from an inner ear infection but that she was eventually diagnosed after having an MRI scan . ‘It is very rare to have one family . member with a brain tumour, but to have two is very, very rare - it’s . pure bad luck,’ said Ms Brunton, who runs her own cleaning business. ‘It . took Tilly six months to be diagnosed so with Chad as soon as he . started showing similar symptoms I wasn’t taking any chances.’ Tilly began feeling ill in 2007 when she was 18. She was soon sleeping for up to 14 hours a day, suffering from double vision and struggling to walk. ‘I had headaches and neck pain and went to the doctors, but nothing they suggested made any difference. I thought maybe I was just eating badly,’ she said. ‘Then I went home at the end of the first term of university and was really sick on Boxing Day. Soon I was being sick most days and losing weight.’ Chad (pictured before his illness) was diagnosed quickly after developing nausea and headaches because Ms Brunton recognised the symptoms as similar to those suffered by Tilly . Chad (pictured on holiday in Florida) had to have ten hours of surgery to remove his tumour. He now requires a year of chemotherapy . Ms Brunton took Tilly to A&E, where . they suspected she had an inner ear infection, but the pain continued . and in February she eventually had an MRI scan, which showed she had a . benign brain tumour. She has since had check-ups every six months and was recovering well when in January this year Chad started complaining of similar symptoms. ‘He started feeling ill in January and I put it down to his picky eating, then he came home from holiday in March complaining about headaches too,’ said Ms Brunton. Chad was given an MRI scan in May which found the malignant medulloblastoma and he had 10 hours of surgery at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge to remove it. He has since had a course of radiotherapy and will spend the next 12 months being treated with chemotherapy. Ms Brunton said: 'Chad started complaining about headaches and having too much air in his head and it was like deja vu. People told me lightening never strikes twice and there was no way he could have a brain tumour too, but I recognised the signs' ‘It’s a difficult time but we are just so pleased we caught Chad’s brain tumour when we did,’ said Ms Brunton. ‘We don’t know what caused the brain tumours. There needs to be more research done into them.’ Dr James Nicholson, consultant paediatric oncologist at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, said: ‘The vast majority of brain tumours affecting children are sporadic - the cause is unknown, and they just come out of the blue. ‘Inherited brain tumours are very rare, and when they occur, are usually associated with other inherited conditions. ‘It is therefore extremely rare to encounter two siblings who have both had brain tumours, and of different types.’ Tilly still has to go for check-ups every six months. Chad had surgery to remove the tumour and he is now undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy . The family is now raising money for brain tumour charities. Image shows Tilly doing a parachute jump to raise money for Brain Tumour UK . Dr Alison Evans, of The Brain Tumour Charity, said a UK study was now taking place to look at samples from people where members of the same family had experienced brain tumours. She said: ‘We know the chances of being diagnosed with a brain tumour could be two to three times higher if a relative has already been diagnosed, but the factors that influence this are still unknown.’ The family is now fundraising to help provide replacement games and toys for the oncology ward at Addenbrooke’s Hospital and for the charity CLIC Sargent, which helps children with cancer.

"By . Helen Collis . Had he known he was heading for 'Blow Me Down' park, perhaps Jonathan Trappe would have taken a different route with his helium balloon. But his fate was in the winds, quite literally, and after just 12 hours since launch and experiencing problems, he decided to cut his losses and crash on land, rather than risk further problems across the Atlantic. Dropping at a rate of knots over mountains and forest, he had no idea he was heading straight for Newfoundland's ironically named reserve, 'Blow Me Down Provincial Park'. Shattered dreams: Jonathan Trappe's lifelong dream to cross the Atlantic under a canopy of helium balloons ended in disaster in a forest in Newfoundland, Canada . It wasn't until he was rescued the next that he realised where he had landed, and couldn't resist a photo with the fatefully named park . He eventually landed after a scary . descent, five miles south of the park, but when he realised how close he . had come, he couldn't resist a photo with the signpost. Mr Trappe says his attempt to cross the Atlantic using helium was doomed due to 'technical problems'. The 39-year-old pulled off a risky dusk landing in thick fog then spent the night in a bog in the Canadian wilderness. However, his trip set a new world record for the longest flight of its kind using he world's largest assembly of cluster balloons. Incredible footage shot with a Go Pro camera shows Mr Trappe coming down fast through the trees as he prepares to land. The explorer frantically shears away balloons with a knife to bring him down to earth. Promising: Things seemed to get off to a good start when he launched Sept 12 from Maine, USA, to begin his 2,500 mile journey across the ocean . But it all ended in disaster, when after just 12 hours flying, and having travelled 350 miles, hie started to experience problems with his balloons . In interview for the first time since his dangerous crash landing, Mr Trappe explained how he had to judge whether to lose ballast or cut balloons as he tried to navigate a safe landing at 50mph over a forest and past a mountain, without being sure of the coastline . The only communication he had with those following his crossing, was to let them know he'd landed safely and would spend the night in his 'boat'. He didn't know where he had landed . He said: 'Before I could land I first . had to clear over a mountain - there is no way to land any aircraft on . this mountain - a helicopter, an aeroplane, or a balloon. 'I was coming in at 50mph and I couldn't . tell where the coast was, where the water stops or where the land . started. I could only see the mountain. 'It was a very sharp sequence of venting and ballasting that got me down through the trees and onto the ground.' Speaking exclusively to Barcroft Media, Jonathan also revealed cutting loose the hundreds of colourful helium balloons that had kept him afloat was one of the hardest moments. He said: 'It was heartbreaking letting the balloons go - they were like my babies. Video footage of Jonathan Trappe showed how he lurched form releasing ballast and cutting balloons as he tried to dodge the trees and mountains . The view from inside the craft as it crashed through the forest canopy shows just how dangerous a landing Mr Trappe lived through . The explorer spent the night in the forest, with nothing but the swamp mosquitoes to accompany him . 'But it was either come down on land or come down in the middle of the Atlantic.' And rather than calling for help, the . IT consultant from Raleigh, North Carolina, US, made camp in his gondola . among hundreds of mosquitos. He said: 'I had no idea where I was and it was too dark to venture out. 'I had three bottles of mosquito repellent which I left for the people who helped me inflate. 'I would have given $100 for one that night. The next morning, he assessed the situation and began to prepare the equipment to be rescued . Help arrived: Mr Trappe prepared to airlift his craft out from the Canadian wilderness after he crashed at 50mph ending his Atlantic crossing attempt using helium balloons . During the rescue attempt, the yellow craft became entangled in the trees . Jonathan chartered a helicopter to winch the yellow gondola out of the Canadian wilderness in preparation for his return to the US . 'But . I didn't want anyone to risk their safety coming out to look for me. I . radioed my control center and told them not to put out a call. 'The next day I found out I had landed in a bog. There was hundreds of mosquitoes everywhere. 'The area that I landed in was completely impassible.' His . dramatic journey also saw him almost freeze directly after take off . when condensation from the ground began to freeze as he gained altitude. He said: 'As I climbed higher my hair froze into spikes. The intrepid adventurer was forced to cut short his incredible quest after just 12 hours due to technical problems and his craft was eventually retrieved from the Canadian wilderness by a helicopter . Deflated: Mr Trappe, who has crossed the Alps floating beneath a cluster of helium balloons, said he feels deflated by his latest attempt to cross the Atlantic . Rescued: Mr Trappe said during his night in the forest, he would have paid $100 for some mosquito repellant . Sad ending: He was lucky to escape unscathed from his perilous landing, but the adventurer says he was devastated to have to cut loose hi s balloons, realising his Atlantic crossing attempt was over . 'The water droplet on the balloons froze and started falling on me like snow. 'I had to strip off all my clothes and change into new ones because they were frozen."" However, for most of the journey Jonathan enjoyed perfect weather reached heights of up to 23,000ft in clear blue skies. On Sunday Jonathan chartered a private helicopter and winched his yellow gondola out of the bog in preparation for his trip back to the US. Although turbulent Atlantic weather was the main threat to the record attempt, a technical problem with ballast caused the attempt to be aborted. The doomed crossing all began on September 12 in Maine, after hundreds of supporters helped prepare the journey by filling hundreds of giant helium balloons . Despite fears Atlantic weather systems would be the greatest obstacle to achieving his dream crossing, the landing was blamed on a technical problem relating to the balloons . In spite of his failed Atlantic crossing attempt, Mr Trappe still managed to break the world record for furthest distance flown in a cluster balloon . The explorer revealed that ballast consumption during the initial part of his flight would not have allowed for the full crossing. ""There was no way I was going to make it across and it was better to go down on land than in the middle of nowhere,' he added. 'I was going through my ballast too fast - I either had to land here or in the middle of the ocean.' The cluster balloonist was attempting to cross the Atlantic using giant balloons filled with helium. However, he still managed to break the world record for furthest distance flown in a cluster balloon. There were commiserations around the world - including a message from Virgin boss and fellow balloonist, Richard Branson. Lift off: The balloon launched at 6.30am but it only travelled for 12 hours before Mr Trappe made the decision to abort the record-breaking attempt . His planned route would have seen him hitch a ride on winds propelling him towards Europe - potentially landing anywhere between Iceland and Morocco . He became the only person to have crossed the English Channel by cluster balloon in May 2010, and the Alps in September 2011 . He tweeted: 'Commiserations to Jonathan Trappe, who has abandoned his UP-style cluster balloon crossing. I know how you must feel!' Trappe messaged his followers on Facebook saying he had landed at an 'alternate location' and was safe and well. The IT consultant from Raleigh, North Carolina, US, took off on Thursday September 12 at 6.30am EST attempting to be the first person to cross the Atlantic Ocean via cluster balloon. Following the crash landing, Kevin Knapp, based at the command centre, said: 'I can confirm that Jonathan was forced to abandon the planned flight at around 18.30 EST. The incredible helium balloon project sounds like the stuff of fantasy adventures, like the Pixar film UP . 'Thankfully he is safe and well and currently making preparations to get home. 'While disappointing that he had to cut his quest across the Atlantic short, I know Jonathan thanks everyone for their support and encouragement.' Despite fears Atlantic weather systems would be the greatest obstacle to achieving his dream crossing, the landing was blamed on a technical problem relating to the balloons. Fans of the adventurer who were following his movements via a satellite tracker were first alerted to his plight at around 7.30pm EST.","Jonathan Trappe, from Raleigh, North Carolina, had to judge when to offload ballast and when to cut balloons to avoid hitting trees when he crash landed .

Mel Greig has launched legal action against Southern Cross Austereo alleging employer treated her unfairly . One of the Australian DJs behind the 'royal phone call' prank that led to the death of a nurse is suing her radio station for failing to provide 'a safe workplace'. Mel Greig, 31, pretended to be the Queen . when she and co-host Michael Christian phoned King Edward VII Hospital in London in December and . was put through to the Duchess of Cambridge's room. The prank, during which the pair learned . details of the Duchess's morning sickness, caused uproar in Britain and led to the death of Jacintha Saldanha. It was revealed today that Miss Greig is taking legal action against Southern Cross Austereo radio group as it was learned she has been far from happy with her treatment. She has reportedly been told by the company not to send a condolence message to the nurse's family. While her former co-host Mr Christian, 26, has returned to work - and has been awarded the company's 'top jock' award - Miss Greig remains at a secret address as she prepares to voluntarily fly to London to attend the inquest into the death of Ms Saldanha in September. Friends said the death of the 46-year-old nurse was still weighing heavily on Miss Greig, who, according to the radio network, can 'return to work at a time that's right for her.' The Advertiser newspaper of Adelaide reported that she has filed a claim with Australia's Fair Work Commission on the basis she has received unfair treatment. Mr Steven Lewis, group leader for commercial litigation at the Slater and Gordon legal firm, confirmed the move. He told The Advertiser: 'I can confirm that a general protections application has been filed with Fair Work Australia on behalf of Mel Greig against Southern Cross Austereo alleging the radio station failed to maintain a safe workplace.' Nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who transferred the prank call from Greig and her co-host Michael Christian to the Duchess of Cambridge's room and was later found hanged . The DJs learned details of the Duchess of Cambridge's morning sickness when they called the King Edward VII Hospital in London. The Duchess is pictured with Prince William outside the hospital . The paper said it was understood that in coming weeks Miss Greig and the radio network would attend a conciliation conference 'where they will confidentially attempt to resolve their differences.' Scotland Yard has passed a file of evidence to Australian police over the prank call. British prosecutors have already said that no legal action will be taken in this country over the call, but yesterday the Metropolitan Police sent the information to the Australian Federal Police and New South Wales police. A spokesman said: 'The MPS has requested that consideration is given as to whether any offences were committed under Australian legislation.' If there is no satisfactory outcome, the dispute will go before the Federal Court. A close family friend, speaking anonymously, said it was hoped Miss Greig would finally be able to end her ordeal. There was no immediate comment from Southern Cross Austereo. Miss Greig celebrated her 31st birthday at an Adelaide hotel last March and despite being surrounded by 40 family members and friends she was said to be still suffering badly from the fall-out from the hoax call. 'It's been really hard for her to move on,' a friend said of the once-bubbly presenter. 'She hasn't been able to tell the . Saldanha family how sorry she is for their loss and I think that's made . it really hard for her.' Christian has continued to work since the furore and has won a 'top jock' award but Greig is still in hiding . It was Miss Saldanha who had received the early morning hoax call at the hospital and, believing that it was the Queen and Prince Charles on the line, put the two DJ pranksters through to a nurse on duty in the Duchess's private room. As a result of the outrage following the call and the subsequent suspected suicide death of Miss Saldanha, Miss Greig lost her 'dream job', said a friend. Since then, said her friends, the radio network had not offered her a decent job for her to return to.","Mel Greig, 31, has launched legal action against Southern Cross Austereo .

One of the Australian DJs behind the sick prank on the Duchess of Cambridge's hospital has sparked outrage again after accepting a national award for his stunt. Michael Christian, who paired with Mel Greig during the hoax on Australia's 2Day FM, has been named the 'next top jock' of the station and now describes himself as being 'at the top of my game.' His comments come despite the fact that the nurse who took his initial call Jacintha Saldanha, 46, was found hanged three days after the incident. Australian DJs Mel Greig (right) and Michael Christian (left) were responsible for hoax calls to the hospital treating the Duchess of Cambridge . Nurse Jacintha Saldanha (left) was found hanged three days after the hoax call. Mr Christian (right) has now been named 'next top jock' at his radio station and said he was 'at the top of my game' Along with the award he has won a trip to Los Angeles. In a statement after receiving the . gong, Christian said: 'From the start, I felt like I had something to prove to . myself... Regardless of all that's happened in the past few months, I'm . still at the top of my game. Prank: The Australian DJs rang King Edward VII hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for morning sickness and tried to get information about her condition . 'So it felt good to see my name at the top of the final leader board!' Christian and Greig called King Edward VII hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated last December pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles. Mrs Saldanha failed to see their poor impersonations and transferred them through to another nurse who revealed some details about her condition. The stunt drew widespread criticism with the the hospital's boss John Lofthouse saying: 'This was a foolish prank call that we . all deplore.' Three days later Jacintha Saldanha was found hanged at her London accommodation. Only two months ago, it emerged that in one of the three letters she left, Mrs Saldanha directly accused the two Australian DJs of driving her to her death. She even said they should pay the mortgage for the Bristol home where her accountant husband Benedict Barboza, 49, and children Junal, 17, and Lisha, 14, still live. In the handwritten note, addressed to her managers at the Edward VII hospital, she said: ‘Please accept my apologies. I am truly sorry. Thank you for all your support. ‘I hold the Radio Australians  Mel Greig and Michael Christian responsible for this act. Please make them pay my mortgage. I am sorry. Jacintha.’ Despite the furore, the owners of the Australian station, Southern Cross Austero, have decided to name Michael Christian as its top DJ. Accepting the award the 26-year-old said: 'If this competition has taught me anything, it's that there's a LOT of talent in this company. 'Plus . it's given all our announcers access to ideas, ways of thinking and . people we might (not) normally have day-to-day contact with.' MP Keith Vaz, said giving an award to Christian was 'distasteful and disgraceful'. The chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee: 'It is ludicrous that the company that employs this DJ, having faced such international condemnation, should have given the award to him. 'It sends out completely the wrong message at the wrong time for the wrong reasons. 'The family are still grief-stricken and await the results of the inquest, which will resume in September.' Twitter users also took to the social network to express disgust at the decision. chelle wrote: 'I don't think DJ #MichaelChristian should have received that award. That prank caused so much harm, intentional or not. Be responsible.' Dale Anderson added: ‏ 'Royal radio prank dj Michael Christian gets Aussy dj award... wtf??? Be a man dont accept it... #noshameor not. Be responsible.' Mr Christian's award comes as co-host Miss Greig is said to be still suffering remorse over the prank . Christian's reaction is a far cry from the tearful interview he and Miss Greig gave in the aftermath of Mrs Saldanha's death. He said at the time: 'Our deepest . sympathies are with the family and friends of all those affected. 'Obviously Mel and myself are incredibly sorry for the situation and what’s happened. We . hope that they [Mrs Saldanha’s family] are doing OK and they’re getting . the love and support that they deserve and need right now.' Christian's co-host Miss Greig is . said to be still suffering remorse over the prank and the nurse's death - . and has reported being frozen out by Southern Cross Austereo. Of . the pair, she is the only one who has offered to travelled to London to . give evidence at the inquest of 46-year-old Miss Saldanha - expected to . be held in September - and remains in limbo with her bosses saying they . are working for her to return to work 'at a time that's right for her'. Australia's Communications Minister Mr Conroy has condemned the decision to give Christian the award. The inquest into the death of Jacintha Saldanha, pictured with her husband Ben Barboza, is expected to be held in September . He said: 'I think there's a bit of bad taste involved there,' Mr Conroy said on Melbourne radio station 3AW. 'There were some very serious consequences of what was a prank and to be seen to be rewarding people so soon after such an event I think, is just in bad taste.' Australian author and former 2Day FM presenter Wendy Harmer said industry insiders are 'bewildered and embarrassed' by the decision. Writing in the Guardian she said: 'What a slap in the face for Saldana’s family. What an appalling message to send to staff. 'Did they mean to say: “Get your face out there. Do anything. Whatever it takes”? 'Because that’s how this is being read. And to say it’s not a good look is a wild understatement.' News of Christian's award comes after it was reported by Adelaide's Sunday Mail newspaper that the radio station's management had distanced themselves from Miss Greig, 30. An unnamed source told the paper that the producers who were involved in the prank and Mr Christian had not been having much contact with Miss Greig. 'It seems as though everyone has gone back to work as though nothing has happened,' the source said. Miss Greig's lawyers have said she wants to testify at the inquest into Miss Saldanha's death. The newspaper suggested that Miss Greig had been stopped from sending a condolence letter to the nurse's family. As part of Mr Christian's award trip to Los Angeles he will be taken on a tour of the studios of the city's leading radio station. The apparent split between himself and Miss Greig was not foreseen by either of them when they pulled off the prank in December, as they later admitted in an interview with an Australian current affairs TV programme.

A deadly strain of avian flu may have passed between people for the first time, experts believe. The avian influenza A (H7N9) virus is thought to have been transmitted between father and daughter in eastern China, according to research published online by the British Medical Journal (BMJ). The findings provide the strongest evidence yet of H7N9 transmission between humans, but its ability to transmit itself is 'limited and non-sustainable', the experts believe. Researchers, including from the Jiangsu Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the Wuxi Municipal Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, presented evidence on the strain, which emerged in eastern China in February. Scroll down for video . An employee sprays disinfectant on chickens suspected of being infected with the H7N9 virus at a poultry market in Hefei, Anhui, China. It is believed the virus has now spread between humans . As of the end of June, 133 cases have been reported, leading to 43 deaths. Most cases have been among people visiting markets selling live birds or among those who had contact with live poultry in the seven to 10 days before becoming ill. The latest study examined the case of a 60-year-old father who regularly visited a live poultry market and became ill five to six days after his last visit in March. He was admitted to hospital with fever, cough and shortness of breath but, despite intensive care treatment, died of multiple organ failure on May 4. Bird flu epidemic: A market inspector burns dead chickens seized from a poultry centre in this file picture . His 32-year-old daughter, who was previously healthy, looked after him at his bedside before he was admitted to intensive care. She had no known exposure to live poultry before falling ill with a very high temperature, cough and fever. The daughter developed symptoms six days after her last contact with her father and was admitted to hospital. Despite intensive care treatment, she died of multiple organ failure on April 24. Follow-up investigations revealed almost genetically identical virus strains from each patient, suggesting transmission from father to daughter. Another 43 people were also tested who had had close contact with the father, daughter or both. One had suffered a mild illness but did not test positively for the avian flu strain. The others showed no signs of exposure. Dr Peter Horby, senior clinical research fellow at the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Hanoi, Vietnam, said of the study: 'The most likely source of infection for the daughter was her father, during the period that she cared from him whilst he was ill.' He said limited person to person transmission had been reported for other strains, H5N1 and H7N7, and the swine origin flu virus H3N2v. He said the strains have been around for more than a decade, but 'have not progressed any further down the path towards a pandemic virus'. A breeder covers his face as he is forced to close his business because of fears over the H7N9 virus, in Yuxin township, Zhejiang province . He added: 'Limited human-to-human transmission of H7N9 virus is therefore not surprising, and, like H5N1, H7N7, and H3N2v, does not necessarily represent the early stages of a trajectory towards full adaptation to humans.' Dr Horby said, however, that intensive surveillance was needed, including of the dose of virus needed to infect people and the role of repeated exposure to the strain. Professor Wendy Barclay, chair in influenza virology at Imperial College London, added: 'The editorial accompanying this paper on human transmission is spot on - there was no genetic change in the virus and it is not surprising that under close contact some transmission is seen.'","H7N9 strain believed to be passed from father to daughter in eastern China .

Role model: The plus size brand hired the actress because they said she's 'a true advocate of a positive body image' Lisa also proved that size is no obstacle to grace and flexibility as she impressed on the dance floor on last year's Strictly. Since then, she's stayed true to the show's slogan 'keep dancing' by starring in judge Craig Revel Horwood's show Strictly Confidential that toured the country over the summer. Now the TV presenter has turned her hand to modelling saying she couldn't turn down Evans when they asked her as the store has always been a 'firm favourite' of hers. Got the season covered: The collection includes work and casual wear as well as party pieces . Evans specialise in clothes for sizes 14-32 and the new collection includes flattering fitted dresses with three-quarter length sleeves, oriental print blouses and chic and cosy jumpers. Lisa was also a fan of a stud detail biker jacket and glitter ankle boots. Evans said all their footwear was 'designed with comfort in mind' using flexible soles and wide fittings. The range will go on sale in stores and online this September with prices ranging from £12 for black leggings to £65 for the biker jacket.

"By . Jenny Hudson . PUBLISHED: . 18:38 EST, 16 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:32 EST, 19 September 2013 . Ronald Miles says he was given a new lease of life by a hip operation. Following the surgery, he took up rambling in his 60s and now, aged 75, regularly covers five miles a day. But little did he imagine that having prosthetic hips - the most common orthopaedic operation in the UK - could drastically reduce his options for cancer treatment and even his chances of survival because radiotherapy beams bounce off the implant. Fortunately, new technology offered him an alternative. 'Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer and the challenge for treatment is that it occurs in the area where many men have metallic implants' The former plumber was diagnosed with prostate cancer three years ago. 'Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer and the challenge for treatment is that it occurs in the area where many men have metallic implants,' explains Dr Ahmed El-Modir, consultant oncologist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. 'This is something we see on a fairly regular basis, as around 30,000 men have hip replacements every year in the UK and one in nine of all men will develop prostate cancer.' Implants pose problems when patients need radiotherapy. This is because the metal or ceramic devices either block the path of the radiotherapy beam, preventing it from hitting the cancer, or they deflect the radiation to other parts of the body, damaging healthy tissue and organs. Ronald, from Birmingham, was faced with this problem after a routine check-up led to his cancer diagnosis. He had both hips replaced in his late 50s, after years of crouching and bending under appliances took theirs toll on his joints. 'My new hips gave me a new life,' says Ronald. 'I joined the University of the Third Age with my wife, Patricia, and we became regular ramblers in our local group.' Then at the age of 70, Ronald had a general health check at his GP surgery. This included a PSA test, a blood test to measure levels of a protein called prostate specific antigen (PSA). High levels of PSA may be a sign of prostate cancer risk. His first PSA result was normal, but when the test was repeated 18 months later, it was slightly raised for his age, at 6.3 (for men aged 70 and above, any result over five is considered elevated). For another 18 months, Ronald had further tests and when his PSA rose above seven, he underwent a biopsy. He was diagnosed with locally advanced prostate cancer, which means the disease had not spread beyond the prostate but was sufficiently aggressive to need treatment. Source of the problem: X-ray of human pelvis showing double hip replacement . 'Even though I had been through three years of PSA tests, you are never prepared to hear you have cancer,' says Ronald. 'It was a  big shock.' As he discussed the different treatment options with his doctor, Ronald discovered the implications of having artificial hips. 'Surgery was not recommended for two reasons,' says Dr El-Modir, his oncologist, who specialises in prostate and other cancers affecting the pelvic area. The prostate is surrounded by a capsule made of fibrous tissue and although the cancer had not spread beyond the prostate, it was close to the edge of the capsule. 'This meant that if surgery was chosen, there would be a high risk of leaving cancer cells behind.  And we also take Mr Miles's age into account.' Furthermore, his cancer was deemed too aggressive for brachytherapy, where radioactive seeds are implanted directly into the cancerous areas of the prostate. External Radiotherapy, where the treatment is delivered by a machine, was the only option for a cure left - but this presented  a challenge. 'If you imagine the pelvis area as a circle, the prostate is in the middle with the hips on either side,' says Dr El-Modir. 'So the hip prosthesis is very close to the area of treatment, about 5-10cm from the prostate. 'It is not just this proximity - it is the fact that the prosthesis lies directly in line with the prostate, which makes it hard for the radiotherapy beams to reach without hitting metal. 'Beams can't go through metal. This means there is a risk that the patient won't get the right dose. Also, if the beam hits the metal, it will bounce off in an unpredictable direction, with a risk of seriously harming nearby organs, such as the bowel and bladder.' The same problem exists whether the artificial joint is made up of metal or ceramic material or a combination of both. 'The prosthesis lies directly in line . with the prostate, which makes it hard for the radiotherapy beams to . reach without hitting metal.' Women with a hip replacement who develop uterine or cervical cancer as well as men and women with bladder cancer can also have problems. Together, these cancers affect more than 20,000 people every year and, like prostate cancer, often strike around the same time as hip replacements are undertaken. So Ronald's only option would have been hormone treatment, drugs that block testosterone, which fuels prostate cancer. However, it does not cure the disease and is on average only effective for 18 to 24 months. Ronald was able to benefit from new technology that made curative treatment a safer and feasible option. TomoTherapy is based on delivering radiotherapy using the same sort of machine as a CT scanner. Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital is one of a handful of UK cancer centres to have a £4 million TomoTherapy machine (others are found in London  and Cambridge). Treatment is delivered through a device shaped like a ring doughnut. The patient lies in the middle of the ring and beams can be aimed from every part of the 'doughnut'. 'This is a really important development for people with prosthetics and pelvic cancer,' explains Professor Joe O'Sullivan, consultant clinical oncologist at the Northern Ireland Cancer Centre, Belfast City Hospital, and spokesman for Cancer Research UK on radiotherapy. 'With a traditional machine, we are delivering the radiotherapy beam from five or six fixed positions. 'TomoTherapy is a type of arc therapy, which means rather than working with a small number  of fixed positions, beams are directed from all positions and angles in the arc.' It means the radiotherapy beams are able to reach the tumour more easily, without hitting metal, and avoiding the risk of harm to nearby areas. 'Radiotherapy is involved in the cure of half of all patients with cancer, many of whom will not need surgery or expensive drugs,' says Professor O'Sullivan. 'Although the initial investment in the machine is high, that machine will then treat 30 patients a day for ten years.' Adds Dr El-Modir: 'A 78-year-old today may be playing golf and have ten to 15 years ahead of them. We need to have curative options for these patients that do the least amount of harm and TomoTherapy is ideally suited to do that.' This group of men aged 70 and above who want active treatment for prostate cancer, rather than management (meaning limited survival), is growing by 10 to 15 per cent a year, says Dr El-Modir. 'Older men should not be afraid to ask: “Are there any other options for me?”' says Prostate Cancer UK's director of policy and campaigns, Dr Sarah Cant. Ronald completed his treatment 18 months ago, which involved 37 consecutive days of radiotherapy. 'The only side-effect I had is needing the toilet urgently and more often because the treatment irritated the bladder, but that's settled down,' he says. 'I've got a good quality of life and feel in good health. Of course, I wanted to have an option that actually treated and cleared my prostate cancer so I can put it behind me.'","Prosthetic hips can drastically reduce options for cancer treatment .
