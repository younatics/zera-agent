"Amir Khan enjoyed the luxury of a slap up breakfast before weighing in for his big fight with Devon Alexander. Khan had woken in the morning more than half a pound under for the 10st 7lbs welterweight limit. That gave him the unusual indulgence of his pre-scale treat. He then came in exactly on the limit. VIDEO Scroll down for Amir Khan and Devon Alexander both weigh in on 147lbs limit . Amir Khan (left) and Devon Alexander both weighed in at 147lbs ahead of their welterweight bout . Khan (left) and Alexander will fight on Saturday at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas . The pair had to be split apart by Golden Boy Promotions promoter Oscar De La Hoya during the weigh-in . Khan said: 'As I've been saying, I'm really comfortable now in this higher division. My weight's perfect and you'll see that my strength and power has grown.' Alexander was also right on the weight. The pair then exchanged some light banter. Khan told his opponent: 'I'm from England but I've got more fans than you in America. I'm going to win this in style.' Alexander responded: 'You've got to say that, in your mind you know I'm going to beat you. You know you're already beaten.' Khan, who's fought once at welterweight, believes his power and strength has grown since moving to 147lbs . Alexander is adamant Khan knows he's already a beaten man ahead of Saturday's bout . The weigh-in took place in the MGM Grand Garden Arena, where the fight itself will happen. This tradition began when Ricky Hatton brought his blue Manchester City army to Vegas for his fights with Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. Then, and for subsequent Mayweather and Pacquiao fights, this ritual has been almost as crowded as the fights themselves. Former boxer Ricky Hatton (right) has fought Floyd Mayweather (left) and Manny Pacquiao in the past . Hatton was roared on in the ring by thousands of British fans in both fights at the MGM Grand Garden . By comparison the Khan Army was more like a platoon but they still kicked up a din. The upper tier of the arena has been curtained off. But while Oscar De La Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions are clearly not expecting a sell-out they are predicting a healthy attendance. Of the possibility of going to fight Mayweather if he wins, Khan said: 'A lot of people are saying now that it may well happen but I'm concentrating on beating Devon and then we'll see how it falls.' Khan v Alexander will be televised live on Sky Sports late this Saturday night.","Amir Khan fights Devon Alexander  on Saturday at the MGM Grand Garden .

"Bayer CEO Marijn Dekkers said one of his firm's drugs was for 'western patients who can afford it' The CEO of phamaceutical giant Bayer has sparked fury after announcing one of the firm's drugs was for 'western patients who can afford it'. Marijn Dekkers made the inflammatory comments after the Indian company Natco Pharma Ltd. were granted a government licence to produce a copy of Bayer’s cancer drug Nexavar which they will sell for 97 per cent less than the original product. Under Indian law the government grants compulsory licenses to domestic firms to produce copies of drugs if the original isn’t available locally at a reasonable price, regardless of whether they are under patent. Mr Deekers, who has previously . described India's patent laws as 'essentially theft', said: 'We did not . develop this medicine for Indians. We developed it for western patients . who can afford it.' Nexavar, . which is also known as Sorafenib, has been approved for the treatment . of kidney cancer, advanced liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma), and . thyroid cancers that are resistant to radioactive iodine treatment. Currently . a kidney cancer patient would pay $96,000 (£58,000) for a year's course . of the Bayer-made drug. However the cost of the Natco version would be . around $2,800 (£1,700). Mr Deekers later posted a comment on a Forbes magazine blog claiming he regretted the way the comment was received. He . wrote: 'I regret that what was a quick response from me within the . framework of a panel discussion at the recent FT Pharma conference has . come across in a different way as it was meant by myself. 'However, . I was particularly frustrated by the Indian government’s decision, to . not protect a patent on Nexavar that was given to us by the Indian . patent authority. Nexavar: Currently a kidney cancer patient would pay (£58,00 for a year's course of the Bayer-made drug. However the cost of the Natco version would be around £1,700 . 'I . remain firm that there is no excuse for any country to weaken the . intellectual property rights. Without new medicines people in developing . countries – as well as those in the more prosperous countries – . ultimately will all suffer.' Dr Manica Balasegaram, the Executive Director, Médecins Sans Frontières Access Campaign, which is trying to increase the availability of cancer drugs in developing countries said Mr Dekker's comments summed up 'everything that is wrong with the multinational pharmaceutical industry.' She added: 'Bayer is effectively admitting that the drugs they develop are deliberately going to be rationed to the wealthiest patients. This is a side-effect of the way drugs are developed today. 'Pharmaceutical companies are singularly focused on profit and so aggressively push for patents and high drug prices. Diseases that don’t promise a profit are neglected, and patients who can’t afford to pay are cut out of the picture. 'Drug companies claim to care about global health needs, but their track record says otherwise.' However other commentators have pointed out that drug companies need to be able to charge high prices in order to continue the vital research and development.","Indian firm granted government licence to produce copy of a Bayer drug .

"My father's death made me stronger... He was my hero and I know I'm making him proud . Play for England in the World Cup? I need to learn how to play union first! I hung up on Gladiator Russell Crowe the first time he called . Sam Burgess admitted his first union passed 'in a blur' after helping Bath to an all-important bonus-point win that reignited their European Cup campaign. The 25-year-old, making his first start since switching codes in October, looked lost at times but still made several telling contributions – three of which led to penalties for his side - as Horacio Agulla’s 78th minute try secured the bonus-point that moved Bath into second place in Pool 4 ahead of Glasgow, who play Toulose on Saturday afternoon. Following two cameo appearances from the bench, the Bath faithful finally got their chance to see the 6ft 5in, 18st 5lb star in action from the start. He completed the full 80 minutes at inside centre and will have learned immeasurably more from playing a live match than all the training drills in the world could achieve. Burgess runs in behind George Ford (right) after making his first start for Bath in their defeat of Montpellier . Burgess is still learning his trade, especially in defence, after crossing codes from rugby league . Bath players celebrate victory that reignites their hopes of qualifying from their Champions Cup pool . Bath: Watson; Rokoduguni, Joseph, Burgess, Banahan; Ford, Cook; James (capt), Batty, Wilson, Day, Attwood, Fa'osiliva, Louw, Houston. Replacements: Webber, Auterac, Thomas, Hooper, Sisi, Young, Devoto, Agulla. Montpellier: Berard; Artru, Ebersohn, Olivier, Nasagavesi; Selponi, Pelissie; Leleimalefaga, Geli, Cilliers, Tchale-Watchou, Privat, Ouedraogo (capt), Qera, Tulou. Replacements: Ivaldi, Watremez, Attoub, Donnelly, Bias, Paillaugue, Ranger, Sicart. ‘I don’t want to say I’m disappointed but it’s clear I’ve got a lot of things to work on,’ Burgess said. ‘I felt ok but there’s a lot of things I can get better at. There’s no hiding from that. There are a lot of different aspects of the game I’m enjoying learning. I’m pleased to get that full 80 minutes but it felt a bit of a blur at times. Overall I’m happy.’ Burgess’s three-quarter partner Matt Banahan scored a hat-trick of tries as Bath dominated their opponents for the second week running. But there was no doubt it was the former South Sydney Rabbitoh the 13,282 strong crowd had come to see. ‘Sam’s on the right track and he’ll have learned an unbelievable amount from playing a full 80 minutes,’ said Bath head coach Mike Ford. ‘Spending all week in at 12 he’ll have learned more than the whole time he’s been here. ‘It’ll be a couple of months before you see the real Sam Burgess. But what he’s done so far has been fantastic. We’re ready for all the criticism but we know what we’re doing.’ Matt Banahan (right) races away to score Bath's opening try at the Recreation Ground . Banahan races down the wing to score his second try against the under-par French side . Bath wing Banahan crosses the line for his third and final try of the game . It will inevitably take the man recently described as the ‘greatest rugby league forward on the planet’ time to adapt to his new code. He made enough significant contributions against admittedly underwhelming French opponents to suggest he can make the grade. Occasionally he looked lost defensively. But he will learn. He carried like an ox and made a string of thumping tackles. ‘For me Sam needs to be in the pack,’ Ford added. ‘The plan was to put him in the back row in the last 20 but the game was too tight He looked lost in defence a couple of times but he did some really good things.’ Burgess’s last start in rugby league saw him fracture his cheekbone seconds into the NRL Grand Final, only to play on and secure the man-of-the-match award, and a place in Australian sporting folklore in the process. Burgess made an immediate impact on Friday night, albeit fortuitously, when he failed to gather a pass from No8 Leroy Houston only for the ball ricocheted off his hip and into the waiting Banahan’s hands, who scuttled in from 30 meters. Banahan (centre) and Burgess (centre left) charge through the Montpellier centre . England newcomer Ford takes one of several successful kicks during the game . Burgess has been described as Bath's 'enforcer' by head coach Mike Ford . Television replays suggested Houston’s pass may have been forward but the try was awarded and Bath, and Burgess, were on their way as George Ford converted. Moments later Burgess was involved again when he carried powerfully through the middle and earned his side a penalty as Montpellier’s forwards dived over the top of the ball. There was brief concern as the international rugby league player of the year winced in pain and squinted while holding the left side of his face – which contains four steel plates following extensive surgery in October which delayed his union introduction. But it proved a false alarm. Ford slotted the ensuing penalty before Banahan scored his second try of the night courtesy of a superbly worked set piece move which used Burgess as a decoy runner only for the Bath fly-half to flip the ball behind his centre to blindside winger Semesa Rokoduguni who fed Jonathan Joseph and onto the giant winger. Ford made it 17-0 midway through the first half and Bath continued to dominate the rest of the half without adding to their points tally. Horacio Agulla races away to score Bath's fourth try and earn an all-important bonus point . Agulla dives over to help Bath move above Glasgow into second place in their pool . Bath lost England lock Dave Attwood with a shoulder injury before the break with Stuart Hooper replacing him. ‘I don’t think Dave’s injury is too bad,’ said Ford. Ford kicked his second penalty on 43 minutes as Bath moved into a 20 point lead. Banahan chalked up his third try of the night on 52 minutes – which also saw Montpellier replacement Benoit Paile Laugue shown a yellow card for a dangerous tackle – before the visitors scored two consolation tries before Agulla’s telling last contribution.","Bath defeated Montpellier 32-12 in their Champions Cup clash on Friday .

"Jose Mourinho has provided the clearest indication yet that he will recommend Chelsea offer skipper John Terry a new 12-month contract. It is club policy to offer over-30s only one-year deals, and 34-year-old Terry’s existing arrangement expires at the end of the season. The Chelsea captain remains a first-choice member of Mourinho’s squad, forming a formidable partnership with Gary Cahill in central defence. John Terry is set to be handed a new one-year deal by Chelsea . Chelsea’s manager will make his recommendations to the Blues hierarchy regarding Terry’s contractual situation nearer the end of the season. And the Portuguese has given a major hint that Terry will be offered a new deal after claiming the former England captain could play for at least three more years. ‘Every individual is an individual,’ said Mourinho. ‘There are old players at the age of 22. I know some — 22 and old. I know young guys at 36 or 37. John is one of them. I had Javier Zanetti at Inter who was already 37. When the other guys came after a day off from training, he’d run from his home to burn the energy from his day off. I don’t know (how long Terry can play). You never know when. The important thing is that, tomorrow, it’s the next match and he’s in great condition to play.’ Terry is 34 and has been Chelsea debut back in 1998 . John Terry has been part of the Chelsea squad since he was 19 . Mourinho’s second spell in charge at Stamford Bridge has given Terry a new lease of life when it looked as if his Blues career was fizzling out under Rafa Benitez. And the Special One, who also insisted Eden Hazard’s new contract will be settled soon, provided a simple explanation. ‘Our training methodology helps. The way he is taking care of himself is very important too,’ Mourinho said, ‘but the most important thing of everything is to be happy. I read a famous neurologist who said, “We docs always say do some exercise, eat properly, be careful with salt, be careful with this protein, but we forget to tell people the most important thing: be happy.” ‘John had a period here of so many doubts, question marks. Is he still the same player? Can he play at this level? Is he fit? Will he play or be in the stands? ‘Then, suddenly, the happiness arrives and look at him. It’s been a process. When I arrived we played a European Super Cup and he was not playing. At that moment, he was happy but he was not ready for the high level. So it was also a process. But the reality is he played so well last season and this season, too.’ Jose Mourinho is looking for Chelsea to return to winning ways after defeat at Newcastle last week . Meanwhile, Belgium keeper Thibaut Courtois has been ruled out of today’s home match with Hull City with a minor leg injury, paving the way for Petr Cech to make his first Premier League start this season. Insisting that Cech will not be leaving next month, Mourinho said: ‘He doesn’t need to prove anything to me, the club, his team-mates, to supporters. It’s comfortable to know our goalkeeper tomorrow is Petr Cech.’","John Terry made his Chelsea debut back in 1998 .

"Never mind the niceties. Forget the mixed messages and crossed signals over exactly what went on between Ally McCoist and the Rangers board over the course of another day of madness. None of that mattered come game night. None of it matters now. Because this has to be the end. A final outing for a manager who, however difficult the circumstances, appears destined to fall short in the final push needed to get Rangers back into the top flight. A third straight title should not have been beyond even this dysfunctional club, blessed with a huge support and run on the kind of voodoo economics that guaranteed McCoist the second biggest budget in the land. Queen of the South's Kevin Holt rifles his free-kick into the net to break the deadlock . After one more underwhelming display and another damaging defeat, this to Queen of the South in Dumfries, the task of guiding Rangers — his Rangers — to the Championship crown is clearly beyond the artist formerly known as Super Ally. There appears to be nothing he can do to change it. No hint of a Plan B. No suggestion he and his team are about to turn a corner and go on the kind of scorching run needed to overtake Hearts. Back at the ground where he scored his first ever goal for the club, in 1983, McCoist looked on in private torment as goals from Kevin Holt and Gavin Reilly gave the Doonhamers their first home win over Rangers for 59 years. Jamie Fowler’s team might have won by more, as they picked holes in disorganised and demoralised opponents who, perhaps, could be forgiven for appearing confused at times. After all, they’d probably expended a lot of emotional energy before a ball had been kicked. This was a match day like no other, the usual drag of hours and minutes until kick-off replaced by fevered speculation. Would McCoist even get on the team bus? Aye. More impressively, he managed to stay in seat 1A all the way to Dumfries. Holt's free-kick was another slap in the face for the beleaguered Ally McCoist . Emerging blinking under the spotlight of TV cameras, the Ibrox manager — for now, at least —looked more relaxed once he reached the safety of a corridor underneath the main stand, smiling and greeting those who offered words of welcome and encouragement. Yes, we know Ally has perfected the art of grinning through the agony, be it famously cracking jokes while lying on a stretcher with a broken leg on Scotland duty or deploying gallows humour to deflect from some of the worst excesses of successive Rangers regimes of dwindling competence and credibility. But he didn’t appear like a man overly concerned by his future. As for the latest incumbents to claim leadership roles at board level, well, both Easdale brothers were at the game. It’s not clear whether the in-house Doonhamers DJ had them or the visiting boss in mind when he blasted out The Gambler — yep, Kenny Rogers giving it laldy about knowing when to hold ’em and when to fold ’em — during the warm-up. The man with the music also gave Money’s Too Tight to Mention an airing, so it was more than just a lucky bounce of the shuffle button. There was a danger, of course, that all the talk surrounding McCoist’s future would overshadow a fixture that, frankly, could hardly have been more important to a team desperate to make up ground in the title race. Queen of the South celebrate taking the lead against Rangers on Friday night . Gavin Reilly fires home to put his side 2-0 up against Rangers . Rangers could not afford to lose here, handing Hearts the chance to move 12 points clear by winning at Cowdenbeath. Queens had only just seen a seven-match unbeaten run ended at Tynecastle and, with the visitors sounding occasionally sniffy about playing on artificial surfaces, few would have been absolutely stunned by a home win here. Especially not in these circumstances. To muted chants of Sack The Board from the away end, the home side started like a team with their eye on hunting down Rangers and making them hurt, Reilly coming within a stud length of connecting with a John Baird cross and Iain Russell just over-running a chance before shooting from a tight angle, Steve Simonsen equal to his effort. All this in the opening 10 minutes. Daniel Carmichael looked in his pomp in the middle of the park for the home side, controlling the tempo of play and skipping past players at will. It was no surprise he should play a part, albeit indirectly, in the opener. Rangers Manager Ally McCoist (right) was the centre of attention at Queen of the South . With just under 20 minutes gone, the midfielder created chaos in the ranks of the red-clad visitors by driving past Ian Black to advance down the right flank, then floating in a curling cross that was heading for Russell — until Darren McGregor, in the process of slipping, stuck out a hand to divert the ball. Shown a yellow that could have been a red, McGregor’s relief — and that of his team-mates — did not last long. Holt strode forward to convert the free-kick from the edge of the box in some style, smashing a left-footed effort into the top corner without troubling either the wall or goalkeeper Simonsen. Queens were looking dangerous, stretching Rangers with their pace and passing. If the visitors were a little more blunt in attack, they did create a couple of chances, Jon Daly forcing Ian McShane to clear a header off the line, before Bilel Mohsni nodded over from point-blank range. The introduction of David Templeton for Dean Shiels at half-time was intended to give Rangers more pace and trickery on the wing, although their first chance of the second half came via a more direct route, Daly holding up a long ball and playing in Nicky Law, whose curling left-footed shot was batted away by keeper Zander Clark. Kenny Miller’s sclaffed follow-up summed up his night. Ally McCoist took charge of Rangers for their match at Queen of the South on Friday night . Queens really should have gone two up with 56 minutes gone, Lee McCulloch heading the ball straight to Reilly, whose clever ball inside was hit first-time by Baird — when he really had time to shoot. McCoist threw on Nicky Clark and Kris Boyd in place of Miller and Daly moments later, gambling on a change of strikers to provide something, anything, to gee his team up. Boyd created panic by his mere presence, though he snatched a chance soon after coming on. Aside from the odd roar in response to an on-field clash, of which there were a few, the away support were extremely subdued as their team plodded and rumbled their way into defensive traps or tactical dead ends. Did anyone, but particularly McCoist, have the answer to avoiding yet another damaging defeat? Clearly not. Queen of the South, on the other hand, had the vision and the clinical touch to put this game beyond the toiling away side. As they showed with a killer second goal after 67 minutes. Carmichael’s beautifully executed pass from the right wing found defenders McCulloch and Mohsni too far apart, leaving space for Reilly to take the ball down in one touch and beat Simonsen with a sweetly-struck shot in off the post. End of this contest. And surely, now, the end for McCoist.

"Manuel Pellegrini wants Frank Lampard to put his American ambitions on hold and see out the rest of the season with Manchester City. Midfielder Lampard, 36, is due to leave City at the end of the month to join New York City - the champions’ new sister club in the USA. The MLS season starts in mid-March but Pellegrini wants Lampard to stay in Manchester and help his side’s title charge. Manuel Pellegrini wants Frank Lampard (above) to see out the season at Manchester City . Pellegrini believes Lampard has become a 'very important' player for the Premier League champions . Lampard signed for New York City after leaving Chelsea in the summer . Asked if he would like Lampard to remain at the Etihad Stadium, the City manager replied: ‘Of course - he’s a very important player for us and we need him in this moment. ‘He couldn’t start in the US until January or February, so he prefers to stay here until December. If he can finish the year here, better. ‘Frank is a very important player for us and I hope we will not have any problems for him to stay here. But I cannot say just from one side what will happen with him. ‘He has a loan just until the end of December and there is another club involved, the MLS is involved also, there’s a lot of parties with an arrangement. It’s not just depending on one opinion.’ A run of six straight wins has helped City close the gap on league leaders Chelsea and they head to Leicester on Saturday just three points behind Jose Mourinho’s team. The 36-year-old takes on Leighton Baines during City's 1-0 win against Everton last week . A run of six straight wins has helped Pellegrini's side close the gap on league leaders Chelsea . Pellegrini’s men are faced with keeping the pressure on the pace-setters without their leading scorer Sergio Aguero. The Argentina striker has scored 19 goals in 21 games this season but faces at least a month out with a knee injury. And Pellegrini says he would not rule out a move for a new forward in January. ‘I never close any window about anything we can do to give us an advantage,’ the Chilean said. ‘If all the teams can do it, we can do it also. If we are thinking about that — at this moment we’re not — we will analyse in the moment what we are going to do. ‘Now we are in that moment we are going to make the best decision for the club.’ City must do without November's Barclays Premier League player of the month Sergio Aguero . Pellegrini said Aguero, 26, would not be allowed to return to his native Argentina for Christmas and would continue his rehabilitation with the club in Manchester. In Aguero’s absence, Edin Dzeko will lead City’s attack and Pellegrini says he has every confidence in the Bosnia striker. ‘We trust a lot in Edin,’ Pellegrini said. ‘He had a very good season last season with us. He just renewed his contract, he did that because we trust in him, now it is his moment to try to score goals and try to return to the performance level he had before he was injured.’ Pellegrini will call upon Edin Dzeko (above) in the absence of star striker Aguero . Pellgrini also confirmed that Joe Hart and James Milner are both close to signing new long-term contracts. Goalkeeper Hart, 27, is poised to agree a five-year contract, while midfielder Milner, 28, will get a four-year deal. ‘It’s very close,’ Pellegrini said. ‘Joe wants to stay here. We also want him to be our goalkeeper so I hope it will be ready as soon as possible. I don’t think that we are going to have any problems. ‘Milner, I hope that he will sign also. We will see, same as Joe in the next days.

"The prestige of the FA Cup is under renewed threat after it emerged not one third-round match involving a Premier League team is likely to be played on Saturday, January 3. Confirmation of the blow to FA Cup tradition came after BBC and BT Sport revealed that their total of five televised matches, all involving Premier League teams, would be staged on Sunday, Monday and — for the first time — Tuesday. The FA have caved into demands from Premier League teams, who are playing a full set of fixtures on New Year’s Day, to play no earlier than the Sunday. The decision to bow to this pressure means only half the teams in the third-round draw will play on the Saturday. Aaron Ramsey scores last year's FA Cup final winning goal at Wembley for Arsenal against Hull City . Wimbledon's tie with Liverpool is sure to evoke memories of the famous 1988 FA Cup final . BBC will show the prestigious clash between AFC Wimbledon v Liverpool (Monday) plus Arsenal v Hull (Sunday). BT Sport will feature Dover v Crystal Palace (Sunday), Accrington or Yeovil v Manchester United (Sunday) and Everton v West Ham (Tuesday). Chelsea’s clash with Watford at Stamford Bridge has also been moved to Sunday at 4pm. It means the BBC’s flagship highlights programme Match of the Day on Saturday will probably not show a single team from the Premier League. Dover Athletic's reward for a win over Cheltenham is to be shown live against Crystal Palace on BT Sport . Blyth were one of the stories of the second round, and their third round tie could be first on Match of the Day . Manchester United's trip to Accrington Stanley or Yeovil Town will be shown live on BT Sport. It will be the 43rd time in a row that United's tie will be shown, a record going back 10 years to a 0-0 draw with Exeter. Blyth Spartans, who beat Hartlepool to reach the third round where they face Birmingham City, could be the first team shown on Match of the Day. Other Premier League teams, who are already complaining of exhaustion ahead of the Christmas schedule, have until early next week to request a change from their original Saturday fixtures. The FA are unlikely to stand in their way and have made it clear that they intend to take a pragmatic approach to Premier League teams who would prefer to play on Sunday.

He had festering disputes and disintegrating relations with key Villa players. Morale around the club’s Bodymoor Heath training ground had sunk so low that news of his exit was welcomed by the majority of the squad. A source said: ‘The atmosphere was horrible. It went downhill the moment Keane arrived. He p****d off all the big names he shouldn’t have p****d off and his relationship with the senior players slowly fell apart. Scroll down for video . Roy Keane quit as Aston Villa's assistant manager last month, after reportedly leaving a negative atmosphere . ‘There was so much gloom about the place every time he turned up. When he went there was just a feeling of euphoria and relief.’ Months of simmering tension came to a head when Keane clashed spectacularly with stand-in skipper Agbonlahor in front of stunned team-mates in training days before the Irish assistant’s departure was confirmed. It is understood the long-serving Villa star was talking tactics with Lambert when Keane interrupted. Agbonlahor resented the interference and tried to belittle Keane by telling him: ‘Excuse me, but I’m talking to the boss!’ The two men then became involved in a heated row and had to be separated. The ill feeling continued after the training session and Lambert held talks with Keane in the afternoon when it was decided they would part ways. Gabriel Agbonlahor (left) and Keane had an explosive argument in the build-up to his resignation . This was the last in a series of flashpoints which resulted in Keane alienating himself from the players. They began soon after his arrival in July when Fabian Delph objected to criticism from the former Manchester United captain in training and rounded on him in front of the rest of the Villa squad. The England midfielder, who is said to have taken an instant dislike to Keane, screamed: ‘Don’t try to f****** mug me off.’ Their relationship never recovered. The 43-year-old hardly endeared himself to his new squad after a 1-0 home defeat by Leyton Orient in the Capital One Cup in August when he berated the players in the dressing room afterwards, and told them: ‘If I gave you 10 grand, you couldn’t even score in a brothel!’ Keane is also understood to have laid into the team when Lambert kept them in the dressing room for an hour after a 2-0 defeat at QPR in October. Defender Chris Herd is another of the players said to have had a falling out with the brooding Irishman, who became exasperated with the relaxed attitude to training by some other players, including Charles N’Zogbia. Fabian Delph's (centre) relationship with Keane never recovered after a training ground bust-up in July . And Keane was also exasperated with the attitude of Charles N'Zogbia (centre) in training . ‘It was a combination of row after row and none of them were in private,’ our source told Sportsmail. ‘The problem with Keane is that he demands the same standards that he was used to at United and the lads at Villa don’t get paid enough to put up with that kind of c**p. He just got everybody down.’ The obsessively punctual Keane would leave his Cheshire home at 6am to be at Bodymoor Heath in time for training, and there were players at Villa who liked his attitude as well as his training methods. However, the atmosphere was so poisonous by the end that few were sad to see him go. Relieved players exchanged texts when they were informed ahead of the official announcement on November 28, and the mood on the team bus to Burnley the next day was said to be significantly better than in previous weeks. Villa strongly deny Keane left the club due to disagreements with players, or that Agbonlahor was involved in any row. Keane's (right) departure was allegedly welcomed by Villa players ahead of their game at Burnley last month . The official reason given for Keane’s departure is that he was finding it difficult combining his work at Villa with his job as assistant manager with the Republic of Ireland. That has been met with widespread scepticism, however, considering that Ireland do not have another game until March. It also seems odd that Keane left a day before the game at Burnley and questions about the matter were strictly prohibited in Lambert’s post-match press conference at Turf Moor. The Villa players have also been sworn to secrecy over the real reason behind Keane’s exit, but our revelations today will come as little surprise to those who have followed his controversial career. As a player, his fastidiously high standards led to the infamous row with Mick McCarthy in Saipan over Ireland’s training camp for the 2002 World Cup and Keane being sent home from the tournament. He departed United three years later shortly after a similar falling out with Sir Alex Ferguson and Carlos Queiroz on a pre-season trip to Portugal. Keane's (right) left Manchester United as a player after an argument with Carlos Queiroz (centre) in 2005 . Keane’s friend and former Ireland team-mate Paul McGrath, who spent the majority of his career at United and Villa, admits his compatriot struggles to get along with people who do not match those standards. McGrath told Sportsmail: ‘Roy says it as he sees it and doesn’t have too much interest in respecting big personalities or trying to be nice to people he can’t be bothered with. ‘If he doesn’t agree with you, he will tell you in no uncertain terms and that can rub people up the wrong way. ‘He has high standards, good standards, that make those around him better and if you don’t want to follow them I’m not sure he has time for you. That’s no bad thing when you consider what he has to offer and what he has achieved.’ The intensity of Keane’s management style is laid bare in his splendidly candid autobiography The Second Half, published in October, which includes details of his time in charge of Ipswich and Sunderland. Keane released his controversial second autobiography 'The Second Half' in October . He confirmed that his falling out with Ipswich captain and Republic of Ireland international Jon Walters over concerns the player was angling for a move to Stoke in 2010 involved some ‘effing and blinding, a bit of shoving’. The two men have made up since Keane took over as No 2 to Ireland manager Martin O’Neill, but it’s understood the row was so heated at the time that Walters warned Keane that he knew where he lived. The Ipswich boss then grabbed a pen and paper and handed the player his address just in case. It came to a head after Walters withdrew from a League Cup tie against Exeter in 2010 due to a stomach bug, and Keane demanded the player provide Ipswich’s medical staff with evidence. ‘I sent the physio a photo of my sick,’ recalls Walters. ‘He came round at eight o’clock the next morning with the club doctor and said that he could smell (on my breath) that I’d been sick. ‘You never know where you stand with him and that was the fear factor he brought in. I respected him as a player, but maybe he can’t get his point across as a manager.’ Stoke forward Jon Walters has mended his relationship with Keane, following their time together at Ipswich . In his book, Keane admits: ‘I don’t think I’m a bad manager, but at Ipswich I managed badly. I spoke to some people like something on the bottom of my shoe.’ The combative streak that made Keane a great player just didn’t seem to work for Keane the manager. Defender Gareth McAuley — now at West Brom — describes a pre-season army camp arranged by the manager. ‘That was horrendous,’ says McAuley. ‘He took our phones and wallets away from us, saying, “You’ve got five minutes to phone home and say you won’t be home tonight”.’ At Sunderland, where Keane won promotion to the Premier League in his first season in charge, it was alleged that he slapped his captain Dean Whitehead during the half-time interval of a League Cup tie against Northampton Town in September 2008 after sending the tactics board flying with a kung-fu kick. With more time on his hands now, Keane was back in his hometown of Cork this week signing copies of his autobiography. As details of the latest chapter in a controversial career emerge, he is unlikely to be out of the spotlight for long.","Roy Keane quit as Aston Villa assistant manager in November .

"Gus Poyet has reminded Sunderland’s doubters that victory against Everton would see them equal the tally of 14 points that they held on New Year’s Day last season. The Black Cats suffered a disastrous first half of the campaign before beating the drop by the skin of their teeth. Gus Poyet says Monday night's win at Crystal Palace has boosted Sunderland . Jordi Gomez scored Sunderland's second goal at Selhurst Park . ‘This has been a better start,’ he said. ‘Last year took us so long to get to 10 points and (survival) was looking impossible. ‘Everything before the game (their 3-1 win at Crystal Palace on Monday) was so dark and negative. You need to win to change that and to show people it’s not all that bad. ‘Getting that win was massive. We had to stay positive and believe in what we do.’ And Poyet anticipates a less anxious feel to the Stadium of Light on Sunday. ‘Everything will feel different, even the stands and the supporters,’ said the Uruguayan.

"A schoolgirl was repeatedly forced to have sex with her long-lost father after she tracked him down through Facebook, a court heard. The 13-year-old became aware of who he was through friends and Facebook postings and found out that he was living in South Yorkshire. After meeting her father for the first time, the teenager was invited to stay longer and her mother eventually allowed her to live with the 41-year-old. A schoolgirl was repeatedly forced to have sex with her long-lost father after she tracked him down through Facebook, a court heard  (file picture) But the man then went on to have sex with the youngster 'on a regular basis' over a six month period, Sheffield Crown Court heard. Initially she slept on the sofa but when her father split up with his girlfriend he 'turned his attention' to his daughter, prosecutor Timothy Capstick said. The father rubbed her back before kissing her and the next day he said she could sleep in his bed and he would sleep on the sofa. But during the night he crept into the bed and started having sex with his own daughter, the court heard. Mr Capstick said: 'She did not resist because he was her dad. She said : ""I had only just met him so I went along with it"". The 13-year-old became aware of who he was through friends and Facebook postings and found out that he was living in South Yorkshire, Sheffield Crown Court (pictured) was told . 'She said she felt like hitting out but couldn't as he was her father. It happened again over a six-month period. He would have sex with her on a regular basis, every other day.' The court was told she had first become aware of her father's identity at the age of 13 'through friends and Facebook'. He encouraged the girl to drink alcohol before having sex with her. She eventually left the house and stopped living there. The teenager, who is now 18 and cannot be identified, first told a social worker what had happened then went to the police last year. Police officers found old texts on the man's phone which suggested he had been having a sexual relationship with his daughter. The girl first become aware of her father's identity at the age of 13 'through friends and Facebook' When arrested he initially denied having any contact with the girl and said another family member must have used the phone. The court heard the father was given a 12-month jail term, reduced to six months on appeal, in February 2012 after he was convicted of detaining a 15-year-old girl without lawful authority. The girl, who knew his daughter, was in local authority care and he had been served with a notice not to contact her. Police checked his home and found the girl there although no sexual offences had taken place. The man admitted one offence of sexually assaulting his daughter and 14 offences of sexual activity with her when she was 13. Alison Dorrell, defending, said he now accepted having a regular sexual relationship with his daughter and knew it was wrong. 'Eventually he brought the activity to an end,' said Miss Dorrell. 'He is very sorry and deeply regrets it and wishes he could turn the clock back. He feels sick when he thinks about it.' The court was told that he had a drink problem, suffered from depression and his wife was worried he was a suicide risk. He had been drinking a bottle of Jack Daniels and four to eight cans of cider a day which had affected his physical and mental health. His wife family were supporting him and he was on medication and a special diet because of his health problems, the court heard. Judge Simon Lawler jailed the man for six years. He told him: 'Over a period of six months you grossly abused your position of trust. She was 13 and you were 41 and you took advantage of her. 'When interviewed the girl said she let you do it because you were her father. She did not want to lose what she felt she had gained and she felt he had played with her emotions.' The man is already on the Sex Offenders' Register and was made subject to a Sex Offenders' Prevention Order and barred from working with children.","Teenager found out who father was through friends and Facebook postings .

"Fire-breathing political advocates from the both sides of America's political divide have issued new calls for Barack Obama to fire his attorney general, Eric Holder. LIberal radio show host Bill Press weighed in on the air Friday, and then in a series of tweets, while Texas Senator John Cornyn put a target on Holder's back during a Sunday television appearance. 'I think it’s past time for him to go and for the president to appoint somebody who the public can have confidence in,' the ultra-conservative Cornyn said on the CBS show Face The Nation. 'You know, I've lost confidence in the attorney general a long time ago,' he added, 'over his cover-up over the Fast and Furious investigation.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Barack Obama (L) and Eric Holder (R) are long-time friends, but the pressure to cut loose his attorney general is mounting on the president - from both sides of the political aisle . Bill Press (L) and Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn (R) have both come out against Holder, in the latest suggestion that Obama's hold on his attorney general may soon fracture . Operation Fast and Furious was a Department of Justice program that furnished about 2,000 guns to people between 2006 and 2011, and encouraged them to take the weapons across the U.S.-Mexico border. While the government hoped to track the firearms to drug cartels, most of them were lost - at more than 300 people were killed, including a U.S. Border Patrol agent. The U.S. House of Representatives cited Holder for Contempt of Congress last year, in a stunning criticism of his decision to withhold tens of thousands of pages of documents related to the spectacularly failed law enforcement operation. On Friday, broadcaster Bill Press surprised his left-leaning fan base by tweeting that 'I STILL think Obama should fire Eric Holder.' 'Holder has ignored Wall St, he continues war on drugs, he let Cheney and Bush off the hook,'Press complained. 'Now, he's chasing the AP over phone records.' Bill Press, a one-time co-host of CNN's Crossfire program, is a loud and unavoidable voice on the American political left . Holder's Justice Department is embroiled in a national scandal after secretly spying on phone-call logs belonging to at least 20 Associated Press employees - including their private mobile numbers, and at least one land-line phone in the U.S. Capitol - in the hope of tracking a national security leak about a classified CIA mission. Although federal rules require the DOJ to alert media outlets before going after their records, that did not happen. Holder told a congressional committee last week that he had recused himself from the case, despite a federal law requiring him to personally sign off on subpoenas for journalists' records. President Obama continues to express 'confidence' in his attorney general, even as pressure mounts behind the scenes to replace him. The administration has been slammed with a troika of simultaneous political crises in May. in addition to the AP phone-records issue, controversies still rage over the Internal Revenue Service targeting conservative nonprofit groups for aggressive scrutiny, and the apparent roles of the White House and State Department in doctoring the CIA's assessment of a terror attack on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya. Press slammed Holder for presiding over the loss of two terror suspects from the Federal Witness Protection Program. The DOJ reportedly lost track of them after the Transportation Safety Administration wasn't provided with their new, government-constructed identities . Press, who appeared on the Washington, DC radio station WMAL on Friday, also weighed in on the recent revelation that the DOJ had failed to keep tabs on two terror suspects who were given new identities in exchange for information. 'On top of ALL of that,' he wrote, 'Holder's Justice Dep LOST TRACK of at least two terrorists in witness protection. Time for Holder to GO. Fire him.' Earlier in the week he had opined that 'I have no confidence in Eric Holder anymore, and you shouldn’t either. This AP story from the Justice Dept is too far-reaching. Seizing these phone records is a violation of freedom of the press.' Press is himself a former chairman of the California Democratic Party. Other commentators who have called for Holder's sacking in recent weeks include Esquire magazine's Charles Pierce, Daily Beast correspondent Michael Tomasky, former MSNBC anchor David Shuster and former Current TV host Keith Olbermann. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has also called on the president to send Holder packing. David Shuster, formerly of MSNBC, jumped on the fire-Holder bandwagon on May 13 . On his once-popular TV show, Keith Olbermann named a nightly 'Worst Person In The World,' a dishonor Holder has only escaped because Olbermann has been fired from his job . Eric Holder testified before the House Judiciary Committee and defended his DOJ's seizure of phone records from the Associated Press. The Obama administration has danced on the fine line, since then, between protecting national security and honoring the press freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution . Obama, Tomasky wrote in an online essay, 'ought to ask for Holder’s resignation. This week. Enough already. Holder's rights here aren't more important than Obama sending a strong signal that he is in charge and can make hard decisions.' Olbermann tweeted his disapproval with the Associated Press phone-records scandal. 'If Mr. Holder continues to support this rogue . action, he should resign,' he wrote. Shuster, also on the political left, called the Justice Department's seizure of journalists' phone records 'outrageous and sickening,' 'Mr. President,' he tweeted, 'you must fire AG Holder.' At one point during the fall of 2012, more than 130 members of Congress were on record supporting Eric Holder's resignation or firing because of Operation Fast and Furious.","'I think it’s past time for him to go,' said Texas Sen.

"The 24-year-old was found guilty of manufacturing a firearm and conspiracy to blackmail at Manchester Crown Court . A student who built a DIY gun from YouTube instructions that was then used to shoot a drug dealer has been jailed. Michael Sierotko put together the steel and metal weapon after following step-by-step instructions from a video posted on the website. The 24-year-old from Glossop, Derbyshire, was jailed for nine-and-a-half years after being found guilty of manufacturing a gun and conspiring to blackmail. Manchester Crown Court heard how Sierotko fell in with a gang of criminals after racking up debt following his studies. After researching how to construct the weapon on YouTube, it was used in the kidnapping and shooting of drug dealer Neil Hazelwood. The court heard three masked captors, who have not been identified, bundled the 35-year-old into the back of a car and took him to woodland in Holmfirth, Yorkshire. There, the gun that had been made by Sierotko, was used to fire a shot into Hazelwood's chest. He spent six weeks in hospital following the incident in September last year. Sierotko was cleared of attempted murder and conspiracy to kidnap but found guilty of manufacturing a firearm and conspiracy to blackmail. Sentencing, Judge Robert Atherton said: 'The offences arise out of events that relate to the world of drug dealing. The people involved were working at a level higher than that of the supply on the streets. 'The conversations always involved substantial sums of money and you became indebted in larger sums. 'These were ruthless people who have no regard to anyone if it serves there purpose not to do so.' 'Your role here was to ferry one of the men and collect money and that man Neil Hazelwood was the victim of the blackmail. At the end of the video a man holds the finished gun (pictured). Sierotko used the tutorial to construct a weapon that was later used to shoot a drug dealer in the chest . Michael Sierotko followed instructions given in a YouTube video (pictured) on how to build a DIY gun at home . 'The jury were satisfied that there was a conspiracy to blackmail and you played a part in it.' 'Your role here was to ferry one of the men and collect money and that man Neil Hazelwood was the victim of the blackmail. 'The jury were satisfied that there was a conspiracy to blackmail and you played a part in it.' 'Piping similar to that used (in the manufactured firearm) was found in your home. You had a demonstration video on your phone and it explained how to make the firearm. 'The gun you made had no lawful purpose. It must have been made to be used.' He added Sierotko was a 'clever' young man who had fallen with a group of criminals before constructing the weapon. 'I have watched you giving evidence and you are a clever young man and your academic achievments support that view but I viewed you as interested substantially in yourself and what you wanted. 'You are highly manipulative. 'You have conducted charity work for your community. You are from a highly respectable family of hardworking people for who your behaviour is unacceptable.' After pleading guilty to a separate charge for owning a sawn-off handgun, the 24-year-old was sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in jail. Parts of the man's handmade gun were discovered by police at his home in Derbyshire where he also kept a sawn-off shotgun . It is not known who used the DIY gun to shoot Neil Hazelwood (right) in the woods in September last year . Defending Stephen meadowcroft QC said of his client: 'He's not a violent individual, he comes from a very decent family. 'He is a man who perhaps did not appreciate the serious mess he was getting himself into - once he went off the rails he was trapped. 'He did well at school and went to college, he has qualifications - in woodwork, tiling and joinery. He could've had a perfectly good life.'","Michael Sierotko made steel and metal gun after watching five-minute video .

"Hollywood icon Audrey Hepburn once said 'it's a wonderful idea that others come first and you come second.' Nowhere is this better embodied than by the deeds of Huang Yuanfeng, a southern-Chinese man who has sacrificed his life for the residents of an isolated village. The 45-year-old suffers from debilitating liver cancer. But rather than funding the costly treatment for his disease which will give him the chance to live, Mr Huang has instead resolved to use his life-savings on building a road through the previously impassible mountains that lead into his home town of Xiaojiangtun. Mr Huang hope his legacy will be renewed trade and tourism to the impoverished town, reports Global Times. Huang Yuanfeng, 45, directs the workers he has hired for constructing a road that offers access to his hometown . Mr Huang is often too weak to direct work on the road, so he sits on a deck chair and uses a walkie-talkie . Xiaojiangtun sits on the far south of China, bordering Vietnam. For generations, locals have endured days of arduous trekking to get out of the village, which is hemmed in by towering rivers and cliffs. Mr Huang moved from the village as a teenager and spent twenty years as a migrant worker in Guilin, a popular tourist destination. It was here he amassed his savings. As was one of few locals to escape the severely remote village, he knows how vital the  road is for the locals. 'What could be more useful than a road that would give my fellow villagers the opportunities that I had?' Mr Huang told Mirror. The four-kilometre-long Xiaojiangtun road, completed this month, steers through cliffs, forests and rivers to connect the town to a national highway. Inspiring: Huang decided  he didn't want to 'waste' his money on expensive medicine, and decided to help his beloved hometown instead . Selfless: Mr Huang has spent $AU34,795.16 (170,000 yuan) on the project, almost the entirety of his life savings . Last May, Mr Huang was tragically diagnosed with liver cancer. Doctors advised he was unlikely to survive, even with costly medical treatment, so he resolved to use his savings on helping others. 'I had the choice of either wasting my money on attempting a cure pretty much everybody agreed wouldn't work, or spending the money on something really useful,' he told Mirror. Mr Huang hired a team of workers last December and rented an excavating machine for the ambitious project. He invested $AU34,795.16 (170,000 yuan) -almost the entirety of his life savings-but Huang told local media it was worth every penny. Huang's daughter Tonghui prepares food for her father. The 21-year-old took a gap year from her scholarship to stand by Mr Huang . Mr Huang's 61-year-old father, who has supported his son throughout the selfless endeavour . 'I built this road for the villagers who can now transport and sell products to the outside. It will also bring tourists to my hometown,' he said. Despite being too weak to stand on his feet most of the time, Mr Huang oversaw the entire process, directing the workers from a chair as he took his medicine through eight hour  days. In order to maintain his health, Mr Huang kept a package on hand filled with fruit, vegetables, a special herb drink and an array of medicine. Thankfully, he did not have to brave the task alone: his father, wife and daughter have stood by Mr Huang throughout the selfless venture. The 45-year-old has been hailed a hero: This Xiaojiangtun woman reportedly told the cameraman Mr Huang is 'really a great man!' Huang's 21-year-old-daughter Tonghui even took a gap year from her scholarship at one of the country's most esteemed institutions-Guangxi University-to cook for her father and help him to take his medicine.

"Four of the six men released this week more than a decade incarcerated in Guantanamo Bay took their first walk in freedom on Friday, stopping to buy a bit of cheese and bread on a stroll through Uruguay's capital. The men - four Syrians, a Tunisian and a Palestinian - are staying at a house in a middle class neighborhood as guests of a major labor union, which has been asked to help by President Jose Mujica. The union's executive secretary, Gabriel Melgareo, said Friday that four of them managed to elude journalists and went on a 6-mile walk along the banks of the Rio de la Plata on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Freed: Former Guantanamo prisoners Adel bin Muhammad El Ouerghi from Tunisia (left), Ali Husain Shaaban from Syria (second from left, behind shutters), Abedlhadi Omar Faraj from Syria (background center, with glasses), Ahmed Adnan Ajuri from Syria (center), and Palestinian Mohammed Abdullah Taha Mattan (right) wave from a balcony in Montevideo, Uruguay . Celebration: Abedlhadi Omar Faraj, left, and Adel bin Muhammad El Ouerghi from Tunisia, right, pose with a Uruguayan flag on a balcony. The men have been accepted as refugees by the country . Out and about: Ajuri, front, and Faraj, back, both Syrians, walk through a residential part of Montevideo . 'They were enchanted by the blue sky of Montevideo, the tranquility of the city, the ability to walk through the streets in absolute calm,' Melgareo said. Bakery worker Laura Larrobla said two of the men stopped by to purchase cheese, yoghurt and bread. 'They looked good, although they only talked through an interpreter,' she said. Melgarejo said that for the most part, the men are euphoric at their freedom and making plans to bring their families. 'Today they began taking Spanish classes,' Melgarejo said. 'A teacher came in the morning and we obtained several Arabic-Spanish dictionaries, which was not easy.' People of Arabic descent make up a small part of Uruguay's population. Talkative: Abedlhadi Omar Faraj, a Syrian, speakls to reports from the balcony of his home . Driving: Matta, left, and El Ouerghi, right, step out of a car with shopping as they explore their new home . Melgarejo said the hosts are trying to accommodate the men's Islamic dietary restrictions: 'We found lamb meat they can eat at a butcher shop that sells kosher meat for the Jewish community.' Melgareo said the former detainee with the greatest physical problems is Abu Wael Dihab, who carried out an extended hunger strike before he was released. He is using crutches and has been less social than the others. The six, who had spent more than a dozen years at the U.S. Navy base in Cuba, arrived Monday in Uruguay, which agreed to take them as refugees. They had been detained as suspected militants with ties to al-Qaeda in 2002 but were never charged. They had been cleared for release since 2009 but could not be sent home and the U.S. struggled to find countries willing to take them. Looking out: Adel bin Muhammad El Ouerghi from Tunisia, another former prisoner, looks out of the window of his new home in Uruguay . Off for a driver: Syrian Ahmed Adnan Ajuri heads out in a car. He was one of several former prisoners who went out for food and to see their new home this week. Others were more reclusive .

"Mick Schumacher, the 15-year-old son of seven-times Formula One World Champion Michael, appears primed to follow in his father's racing footsteps after he was crowned World Karting Vice-Champion on Sunday. The Schumacher family was devastated in December of last year when Michael, who claimed 91 grands prix victories during a spectacular career, was left fighting for his life after sustaining serious brain injuries when he hit his head on rock while skiing off-piste with his son Mick in the French Alps. The severity of the injuries left the 45-year-old German in an induced coma for six months, but earlier this month there was some encouragement for his family and army of fans after he was transferred to his family home in Lausanne, Switzerland to continue his rehabilitation.

Michael Schumacher negotiates a corner at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix for Mercedes AMG back in 2012 . Keen skiier Schumacher sustained serious brain injuries off-piste with son Mick in December 2013 . And there was further cause for optimism over the weekend when his son Mick finished runner-up to British youngster Enaam Ahmed in the FIA's KF-Junior category at the World Championships in Essay, France. Mick had until this year adopted the racing surname of Betsch - his mother Corinna's maiden name. But this season he has raced under the guise of Mick Jnr and after tasting victory in four of his heats, finished six seconds adrift of Ahmed in the grand final to stand alongside the Londoner on the podium. 'Of course I am proud of such an important result,' Schumacher Jnr said before tellingly adding: 'But it is also clear that it is my goal to be world champion. This is only the beginning of my career.' Schumacher and his wife Corinna enjoy happier times on the slopes of northern Italy back in 2005 .

His father Schumacher broke numerous records en route to claiming seven world titles and staking his claim among the sport's all-time greats. The German won back-to-back titles with Benetton in the mid-nineties before remarkably winning five successive championships with Ferrari at the turn of the century. Updates on his condition since his freak skiing accident on December 29 have been sparse. And in a typically brief statement issued earlier this month, his manager Sabine Kehm warned that he faces a 'difficult road ahead' despite the encouraging news that he has been transferred to his home off the shores of Lake Geneva to continue his recovery. 'Considering the severe injuries he suffered, progress has been made in the past weeks and months,' said Kehm. 'There is still, however, a long and difficult road ahead. 'We would like extend our gratitude to the entire team at CHUV Lausanne for their thorough and competent work. 'We ask that the privacy of Michael's family continue to be respected, and that speculations about his state of health are avoided.'","Mick Schumacher has stated his desire to be Formula One world champion .

"A plane-load of Alaskan schoolgirls were left fearing for their lives after the landing gear on their damaged aircraft buckled after it touched down on a frozen airfield. The small propeller plane, carrying the volleyball team for Kolinganek school near Dillingham, southwestern Alaska, skidded 1,000ft down the runway, with sparks flying, before coming to a halt. The twin-engine Piper Navajo craft, which was taking the team to Anchorage for a tournament, broke the landing gear on its left side upon take-off, trapping the pilot and passengers airborne in the damaged plane. Emergency landing: The twin-propeller plane had broken landing gear, which failed during a landing at King Salmon airport in Alaska . Broken gear: The plane's left wheel, which hit a mud bank during take-off from a bad runway, failed to retract in flight, and didn't hold out when the plane landed . Its wheels hit a mud bank on the bumpy runway when the plane took off from remote Kolinganek airport, and wouldn't retract when the pilot tried to move them, the Alaska Dispatch News reported. A tense journey followed in which the plane headed for a neighboring airport so ground crew could assess the damage as the aircraft flew overhead. After officials saw the landing gear hanging off the plane at a dangerous angle, the pilot chose to fly half an hour southwest to King Salmon, because they could deal better with a potential crash. The pilot, Brenten Goodrich, told the girls, their parents and support staff on board to brace before the landing, as he was certain the landing gear would buckle. Melinda Merlino, a setter on the team, told local news station KTUU: 'It was really scary because we never experience this before - we were all nervous about what would happen.' Keeping on: The volleyball team, pictured above, were able to play their matches after continuing to Anchorage . When the plane touched down, the wheels held for a few seconds, but the then plane tilted, starting on its lengthy ski down the runway as fire trucks and ambulances raced towards the downed plane. Nobody was hurt in the accident, potentially because the smooth, icy runway meant the plane could slide smoothly rather than coming to a rough stop. The team members were then flown on to Anchorage and were able to compete as planned. Assistant coach Anastasia Ishnook said: 'Our girls are really strong. They kept it together. 'The pilot was really nice. He said he was sorry it happened today but he couldn’t have had better passengers.'","Team from Kolinganek were headed to tournament in Anchorage .

"When Katie Hnida started classes at the University of Colorado in 1999, she envisaged that her experience would be centered on the football field as the first female kicker for the Buffaloes. But in 2000 while she was hanging out with a teammate in his appearance, she claims that he raped her. The talented athlete revealed her story four years later but the attack was never proven. Instead of people coming to her support, she was branded a liar and had every inch of her livelihood criticized including her sexual history  - even though she was a virgin. Now 33 years old, she claims that the Rolling Stone article about 'Jackie' has done a 'huge disservice' to rape victims and that there is a 'major problem' on college campuses. Scroll down for video . Katie Hnida claims a male teammate on the University of Colorado football team raped her while they hung out in his apartment in 2000 . Even though she became the first female player to score in a NCAA Division I-A game, she has been traumatized by the events of the alleged attack . After realizing that the suspected attacker may not face justice, she described how she feared for her safety on campus, as her accused was still out there, and struggled to sleep in the aftermath. Her coach allegedly told her she was a terrible kicker and the scrutiny led to her transferring to the University of New Mexico. There should would become the first female player to score in a NCAA Division I-A game. Since the attack almost 15 years ago some of the after effects have warn off, but Miss Hnida says there is still a stigma that follows her around. She told Tina Griego of the Washington Post: 'To this day, people call me a liar. 'Sometimes I wish they could be there when I get so nauseous and sick that I'm throwing up and nights I can't sleep and when I got into a depressive funk. 'Those times are rare now – it does get better, I want people to know that — but they are still around because it never truly goes away. It changes you.' 'I didn't expect such disregard for my life. I was a virgin when this happened and incredibly naive. I thought coming forward would force the university to acknowledge it had problems and make changes. Instead, it exploded. 'There is a definite fear for your safety knowing that someone who is capable of doing something as horrible as raping you is still out there. She said the idea of one of her former teammates being falsely accused  would kill her. However she says that fabricated accounts are rare, but the impact is harrowing. She revealed her story in 2004 and was met with intense scrutiny and criticism. Her accused never went to jail, but since she has spoken to people all over the country about preventing violence . 'The attention you get as a rape victim is not fun, it's awful.' Miss Hnida went to the district attorney a short time after the alleged attack took place. She did not report it straight away, but insists it is rare for women to react so quickly by telling the authorities. She said the hardest thing to hear was the warning that her suspected rapist would probably never be jailed. Almost 15 years on from the incident, Miss Hnida is now doing speeches about her experiences and she works with numerous organizations dedicated to preventing violence against women. She said the magazine had a responsibility to 'her [Jackie] and to the public to make sure they were presenting a story that had been thoroughly researched and vetted and their failure to do that did a huge disservice to all rape victims. 'I can tell you we don't have a giant problem with women lying about rape in our society. We do have a major problem with women being raped, especially on college campuses.","Katie Hnida from the University of Colorado came forward in 2004 .

"Canon Andrew White, pictured in Baghdad in 2007, is a marked man by Islamic State . Four young Christians were brutally beheaded by ISIS in Iraq for refusing to convert to Islam, according to a British reverend forced to flee the country. Canon Andrew White, known as the Vicar of Baghdad, told the horrifying story how of the youths, all under 15, were murdered for standing up to the jihadists. The vicar of the city’s St George's Church, the only Anglican church in the whole of Iraq, has had to leave the country for Israel amid constant threats on his life by Islamic State. In a harrowing interview with the Orthodox Christian Network, he said ISIS had killed ‘huge numbers’ of believers in Jesus. ‘Islamic State turned up and said to the children, “you say the words that you will follow Mohammad”’, he said, his voice cracking with emotion. ‘The children, all under 15, four of them, said “no, we love Yesua; we have always loved Yesua; we have always followed Yesua; Yesua has always been with us”. ‘They [ISIS] said, “Say the words.” They [the children] said, “No, we can't”. ‘They chopped all their heads off. How do you respond to that? You just cry. ‘They are my children. That is what we have been going through and that is what we are going through.' British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning and American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff have all been beheaded by ISIS.

Iraq had 1.5 million Christians before the US-led invasion in 2003, but now all that are left are 250,000 who have been displaced from their homes in the north of the country by the advance of ISIS. Canon White, a 50-year-old father-of-two, told another heartbreaking tale of a father forced to choose between his children and his faith. He said: ‘They [ISIS] came to one of our people the other day, one of the Christians. ‘They said to him “either you say the words of converting to Islam or we kill all your children”. ‘He was desperate. He said the words and then he phoned me and said, ""Abouna [Father], I said the words, does that mean that Yesua [Jesus] doesn't love me anymore?” ‘I said, “Yesua still loves you, he will always loves you"".'

Canon White, who has a family home in the UK in Liphook, Hampshire, says it is ‘impossible’ for Christians to survive in Iraq under the tyranny of ISIS. He said: ‘Things were bad in Baghdad, there were bombs and shootings and our people were being killed, so many of our people fled back to Nineveh, their traditional home. ‘It was safer, but then one day, ISIS – Islamic State. They came in and they hounded all of them out. ‘They killed huge numbers, they chopped their children in half, they chopped their heads off, and they moved north and it was so terrible what happened.’","Canon Andrew White tells horrifying story of Islamic State barbarism .

"British expats in Cyprus face a near-total wipe-out of any deposits over £85,000 as the full nightmare  of the stricken island’s EU bailout became clear yesterday. Although it was known that the wealthiest savers would take a  large hit from last week’s €10 billion (£8.5 billion) EU rescue deal, the loss is far greater than feared. The blow will fall on customers of the country two biggest banks – Bank of Cyprus and Laiki Bank. False hope? Economists warn the cut may not have much direct effect since banks are not passing on low rates in indebted countries like Cyprus (above) that need help the most . Savers at the Bank of Cyprus will see 37.5 per cent of any deposits over £85,000 converted into shares in the bank . Bank of Cyprus savers will see 37.5 per cent of any deposits over €100,000 (£85,000) converted into shares in the bank, with a strong possibility that these will prove worthless. Another 40 per cent will be repaid only if the bank does well in future, while 22.5 per cent will go into a contingency fund that could be subject to further write-offs. Laiki Bank customers are also reported to be facing the loss of 80 per cent of their deposits above the £85,000 limit. An early bailout plan – highlighted by The Mail on Sunday two weeks ago – would have seen the losses shared across all bank customers, regardless of their balance. However, that plan was voted down by the Cypriot parliament, leaving the country in urgent need of a new solution to raise its €5.8 billion contribution towards the bailout. Thousands of Cypriots demonstrate to protest against the harsh treatment imposed on Cyprus by the Eurogroup earlier this week . The deal – which was clinched last Monday between Cyprus, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund – made clear that richer bank customers would shoulder a much larger bill. Although it is not known how many of the 60,000 British expats living  on the island have deposits of  more than £85,000, it is likely that a considerable number will be caught in the net. Neil Hodgson, 48, who moved to Paphos, on the south-west coast of the island, six years ago, said he has lost nearly £200,000. The former farmer, who has two accounts with Bank of Cyprus, added: ‘I had more than €300,000 in my deposit account and €20,000 in my current account. When I went to the bank the other day I was told the total balance for both is €100,000. ‘They were unable to explain how this had been worked out but indicated I might get some back at a later stage. ‘I checked online and it confirmed that the €20,000 in my current account remains, but that I only have €80,000 in my savings account. It’s robbery, plain and simple.’ Laiki Bank customers are also reported to be facing the loss of 80 per cent of their deposits above the £85,000 limit . Banks in Cyprus are open for normal business but with strict restrictions on how much money their clients can access, after being shut for nearly two weeks . Mr Hodgson, from Newcastle upon Tyne, whose wife died two years ago, said he moved to Cyprus believing he was destined for a ‘happy life of semi-retirement’. ‘Our farm in Ayrshire was bought by a mining company and I came into a lot of money,’ he added. ‘We moved to Cyprus for the sunshine and easy life but it has turned into  a nightmare. ‘My big mistake was to move all my money here, but at the time things were very stable. Most of  the Brits here had the foresight to move their money in the last few months, but I genuinely thought it would be OK. I’m not sure what the future holds now.’ The Treasury has said it will  compensate any of the 3,000 British Service personnel facing losses.Those hit hardest include thousands of wealthy Russians who  have deposited millions of euros on the stricken island. Peter Dixon, strategist at European bank Commerzbank, said: ‘These suggested new sacrifices being demanded of better-off depositors sound even worse than we assumed. ‘The problems in Cyprus are twofold. First, the central bank ignored the huge build-up of debt. There was a problem of mismanagement. ‘Secondly, the Cypriots essentially imposed these tough solutions on themselves and the eurozone rubber-stamped them.’ Ordinary Cypriots step in the streets to protest against the massive ""haircuts"" imposed by The European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund . Last week markets took fright at suggestions that the Cyprus model could be a blueprint for future  bailouts elsewhere in Europe. Those with less than £85,000 in the bank have also seen themselves hit by the bailout. Temporary capital controls have been imposed to stop residents taking cash off the island, including capping cash machine withdrawals at €300 a day. At the same time, businesses have been told they will be unable to transfer more than €5,000 abroad without approval, while no one, including tourists, can leave the island with over €1,000 in cash. Meanwhile, the spotlight has now swung to Slovenia, another small member of the single currency in which investors are losing faith. Last week, the price it had to pay to borrow money jumped sharply as markets began to take account of the risk that the country may default on its debts. However, on Friday, finance minister Uros Cufer insisted: ‘We will need no bailout this year. I am calm.’ For a currency that promised to provide a sure bet on a glorious future, the euro is turning into the biggest theft of people’s savings in Western Europe since the war. Greece, Ireland, Portugal  and Spain were among the first  to be crushed by the fallacy of  a one-size-fits-all currency.  Now it is Cyprus’s turn, and the scale of losses for some savers  is eye-watering. Last week, the latest Cypriot bailout proposals hinted at a 40 per cent levy on all deposits of more than €100,000, or £85,000. This weekend, it emerged that the true cost for those better-off depositors could be much closer  to 80 per cent. British expats feature prominently among those who will suffer from an effective confiscation of their assets. The euro is setting out to be the biggest theft of people's savings since the war . Claims that the victims are shady Russian oligarchs have  a nasty whiff to them, and even  if some of the cash that will be taken is of doubtful provenance, that cannot justify the burden now being placed on the tiny island economy. Smaller savers may not have been hit by a levy on their bank accounts, but they will be swept up in the economic storm that is sure to descend  on Cyprus as a result of such draconian measures. It’s tempting to wonder why any troubled eurozone country like Cyprus was ever let into what was obviously a rich man’s club. But that is unfair – the poorer members were welcomed with open arms, with the assurance that the euro would turn them into German-style economic titans. It was like persuading  a pauper to join a casino. Yes, Cyprus let its banking sector balloon wildly and, yes, it is the Cypriot government that has dreamt up some of the more masochistic features of the various bailout plans. But all this human sacrifice in the eurozone – austerity, mass unemployment, arbitrary bank account levies – is about saving the euro. You wonder how much pain there has to be before someone realises that what must be sacrificed is the euro itself.","Bank of Cyprus will see 37.5% of deposits over £85k converted into shares .

"A controversial decision to cut the benefits of a man who later starved to death was wrong, the Government admitted today. Mark Wood, 44, weighed just five-and-a-half stone when he died after staff from Government contractor Atos assessed him as being fit to work - despite suffering from more than seven disabilities and illnesses, including Asperger's syndrome. His income was cut to just £40 a week in March last year and he was ordered find employment. He died just five months later. Tragic: Mark Wood (left) in a healthier state before his benefit cut, and (right) after, having lost weight. He was 44 when he died weighing just five-and-a-half stone. His GP said the benefit cut 'pushed him before he died' Today a spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions confessed the decision was wrong, sparking an internal review. It comes just two days after it emerged Atos is to quit its £500million contract early following Government criticisms. Mr Wood's GP Nicolas Ward has blasted the Government-backed contrator for 'pushing him' before he died. Speaking at an inquest into his patient's death, he said: 'Something pushed him or affected him in the time before he died and the only thing I can put my finger on is the pressure he felt he was under when his benefits were removed.' He added that he was an extremely vulnerable and fragile individual who was struggling to cope with life. Mr Wood, from Bampton, Oxfordshire, had suffered for years from obsessive compulsive disorder, Asperger's syndrome, phobias of food, pollution, paint fumes, and social situations, and cognitive behavioural problems. However, in March last year Atos insisted he was fit to work. Scandal: The Government's call for an urgent review into Atos comes two days after the firm announced it will end its £500million contract early following a stream of criticism . Prime Minister David Cameron described the case in his constituency as 'tragic' before backing an urgent investigation into Atos. But Mr Wood's grieving family have blasted the Government's announcement as a 'hollow victory' as it will not bring him back. His sister, Cathie Wood, said the announcement was a hollow victory because it would not bring him back. 'We are pleased but sad,' said 48-year-old Cathie. Asperger's syndrome is a form of autism, often referred to as a 'hidden disability'. It affects how a person makes sense of the world, hampering their social communication, social interaction and social imagination. There is no treatment for the condition and very little research on medication that is used by sufferers. Most people with Asperger's are prescribed a programme of behavioural therapy. 'They have reversed the decision - that is huge but they obviously had the information at their disposal to make the right decision and if they had done that last March Mark would not be dead. 'It is good because it hopefully means we can now get some answers.' Ms Wood and her mother Jill Gant appealed against the benefit cut earlier this month, acting on advice from Oxfordshire Welfare Rights (OWR). Today, they received a letter from the DWP saying it had 'revised' its decision to cut Mr Wood's benefits. A spokesman said: 'The coroner attributed Mr Wood's eating disorder and food phobia as the likely cause of his death, rather than his benefits being stopped. 'However, after receiving new evidence from Mark Wood's GP which was not presented at the first assessment, we have revised our original decision. 'We have written to Mr Wood's family about this decision and are carrying out an internal review.' Atos made £111.76m pounds operating profit in 2013. Ms Wood added: 'I think it is good that Atos has withdrawn but it is only part of the story - the whole system needs to be looked at.' Suzy Drohan, joint manager of OWR, said: 'Mr Wood lived in Cameron's constituency and this happened. 'We . are very sorry this had had to come to light from his death. There . could be other cases in which people have died too. We know there are . hundreds of decisions which are not right.' 'Tragic': David Cameron has spoken out about the 'tragic' case in his constituency and backed a review . Between January 2012 and January this year OWR took 312 cases to appeals against DWP decisions and 281 were successful. Mr Cameron said: 'This is a tragic case and my thoughts are with Mr Wood's family at this difficult time.' The decision means the family doesn't have to take the appeal to court. Nicola Blackwood, MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, said: 'This has been a tragic case and while this decision will not bring Mark back at least it sets the record straight. 'I have been very clear with the DWP that, in my view, Mark's case was badly mishandled by Atos and that the family's appeal needed to be dealt with as a matter of urgency and I am pleased they agreed. 'I also welcome Thursday's announcement that the Government's contract with Atos to conduct these assessments has been terminated early.' Atos refused to comment opn the reversed decision.","Mark Wood, 44, weighed 5.5st when he died after Atos cut his benefits .

"A 21-year-old woman claims to have paid $20,000 to surgically add a third breast in a desperate bid to become a reality TV star. Jasmine Tridevil, not her real name, insists she was rejected by more than 50 doctors who feared violating ethical codes before she found a willing surgeon who would perform the procedure.

While the procedure is possible, surgeons are barred from carrying out any operations that could be harmful to 'human dignity'. The ethical code outlined by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons dictates that 'the principal objective of the medical profession is to render services to humanity with full respect for human dignity.'

However, Tridevil claims she found a surgeon who agreed to carry out the unusual operation on the grounds that she kept their name a secret. She says the medic took tissue from her abdomen and used it to fashion the third breast - a procedure commonly used for normal breast enhancements. The massage therapist, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, has shared dozens of pictures of her new look in custom made bikinis on her Facebook fan page in a bid to convince followers the surgery was legitimate. And she has proudly declared that she been disowned by her mother and sister, who ran out the room in disgust when they saw what she had done. 'My mum ran out of the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me,' Tridevil said. Dreams of being a star: The massage therapist from Tampa, Florida, said her dream is to have a show on MTV . 'My dad… he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.' However, Tridevil insists she has no regrets as she prepares to send pilot episodes of her self-produced reality show titled Jasmine's Jugs to MTV. 'My whole dream is to get this show on MTV,' she told Real Radio 104.1. 'I'm dumping every penny I have into this. If this doesn't work, I'm through.' Scot Glasberg, president-elected of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons blasted the stunt as 'worse than unethical' and 'harmful to society'. He told MailOnline that the operation appears to be legitimate and said: 'This violates every ethical principle not just in surgery but in medicine as well. 'We look to enhance the norm. This is not the norm. 'Nothing speaks louder than the fact that the surgeon required the patient to sign a non-disclosure form.' Reminiscent: Her new look is similar to that of the three-breasted prostitute in the 1990 film Total Recall . Disowned: Tridevil, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, says she has been disowned by her mother . Mr Glasberg said the case will likely be reported to the national board of plastic surgeons and if the surgeon is tracked down they could have their license revoked. 'I meet with patients twice before the operation to make sure they are doing it for the right reasons. 'These are not the right reasons, this is sensationalist and quite frankly horrible.' Despite scheduling interviews, creating a fan page, and hiring a film crew, Tridevil insists her apparent surgery was not an attempt become famous. 'I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,' she claims. 'Because I don't want to date anymore.' The new look is reminiscent of the alluring three-breasted prostitute who parades around semi-topless in the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger film Total Recall. The bizarre character prompted one of the most famous movie quotes to date, as a man declares: 'Baby, you make me wish I had three hands!'","Jasmine Tridevil, 21, 'paid $20,000 to add a breast to become a TV star'

"A bomber pilot who starred in a James Bond movie has vented his anger after he was finally awarded a campaign medal - 68 years after the Second World War ended. Wing Commander Ken Wallis, 97, risked his life as he flew his Wellington war-plane over Germany on 28 missions during the conflict. The patriotic young hero and brilliant flyer was so determined to fight for his country in its most dangerous hour that he even cheated in an eye test to get into the RAF. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Wing Commander Ken Wallis, 97, has been awarded his campaign 68 years after he risked his life on 28 missions over Germany . Mr Wallis, from Reymerston, near Dereham, Norfolk, was convinced he and his crewmates would be recognised for their phenomenal bravery after fighting in 103 Squadron, based at RAF Elsham Wolds in north Lincolnshire. But the bombers, who suffered horrific losses in the war, faced a political backlash after Hitler was beaten as their vital role in the victory was played down. After finally receiving his Bomber Command golden clasp, Mr Wallis said: 'It's a bit late - and long over-due. 'There were 56,000 who were killed in Bomber Command and when we finished operations we thought we would get medals. Mr Wallis, pictured in his RAF uniform during the war, has said his campaign medal was 'long over-due' 'And it was a terrible disappointment when we didn't get them.' The great-grandfather said they were turned into 'villains' after controversial Bomber Command chief, Arthur 'Bomber' Harris, decided to carpet bomb German cities in a devastating night-time offensive. 'There were 56,000 who were killed in Bomber Command and when we finished operations we thought we would get medals' - Wing Commander Ken Wallis . 'They thought we were bombing these poor . innocent Germans, but there was never a moment of pleasure when we did . it,' insisted Mr Wallis. 'None of us wanted to do the job.' He said that he focused purely on dropping his bomb-load and hitting his targets during his 28 raids across Germany. Mr Wallis applied to join the RAF's volunteer reserve service before war erupted in 1939. He was rejected because of poor sight in his right eye but managed to get a private flying licence after his GP failed to check his eyesight when he signed him off. Mr Wallis said he focused purely on dropping his bomb-load and hitting his targets during his 28 raids across Germany. Pictured is Mr Wallis's bomber . Mr Wallis's squadron is pictured here by a bomber at the height of the war . Incredibly Mr Wallis obtained his A Licence for dual and solo flying in a record 12 hours. He was 25 when he finally made it into the RAF at the outbreak of war when he cheated his optician in his final eye test by reading the letters back with his 'good eye' when the doctor wasn't looking. Mr Wallis soon stood out and on tough nine-hour missions the pilot and his team of six carried out the first and third raids on Baltic port Rostock. He said they all knew that at least five or six bombers would not return that night after seeing action over enemy territory. Mr Wallis flying the Little Nellie autogyro during the filming of the James Bond film You Only Live Twice . Mr Wallis made headlines after flying as Hollywood star Sean Connery's stunt double in the 1967 film . 'We had arrangements that if you didn't come back then your traditional bacon and eggs at breakfast the next morning would be given to someone else,' recalled Ken. After being hit in one sortie Mr Wallis had to bale out of his plane in thick fog. He injured his spine after hitting the ground and was awarded a gold braid, known as a wound stripe, on his left arm. Mr Wallis moved to Norfolk after finally leaving the RAF in 1964 - and promptly went on to carve out an exciting new career in the air. Mr Wallis (pictured flying one of his autogyros at his Norfolk home) has set a stunning 34 world records for speed, circuit and altitude feats . The exceptional airman made headlines after flying as Hollywood star Sean Connery's stunt double in 'You Only Live Twice' in his autogyros in the huge 1967 James Bond hit. He was made an MBE in 1996 and between 1968 and 2002 he set a stunning 34 world records for speed, circuit and altitude feats. Many of his staggering landmarks still stand - including the 129mph top speed for a 3km flight in the tiny rotor-powered aircraft. The airmen of Bomber Command learned just last year that their would finally be rewarded, nearly 70 years after the end of the war. The announcement was made as Prime Minister David Cameron also revealed, in December, that the veterans of the Arctic Convoys would be given campaign medals. In a linked announcement, Mr Cameron said the airmen of Bomber Command would get a campaign clasp to match the Battle of Britain clasp given to Fighter Command personnel. The Prime Minister told MPs he had accepted the recommendations of a review of military medals carried out by former diplomat Sir John Holmes. He found that Bomber Command personnel were unfairly treated – in part because the bombing of Germany was criticised after the war. Mr Cameron told MPs he agreed ‘the heroic aircrews should be awarded a Bomber Command Clasp’ and said: ‘I am very pleased that some of the brave men of the Arctic Convoys will get the recognition they so richly deserve for the very dangerous work they did.’ Dr Yves Dias and Matthew Usher have been awarded the prestigious Arctic Star medal which recognises veterans of the Arctic convoys (file picture) Two war veterans have finally been recognised for their heroic efforts fighting the Nazis after waiting 70 years. Dr Yves Dias and Matthew Usher endured sub-zero temperatures and brutal attacks from German forces while they, along with thousands of other men, battled to get much-needed food supplies to allied troops in Russia during the Second World War. The pair, both from Gosforth, Newcastle, were able to apply for the prestigious Arctic Star medal which recognises veterans of the Arctic convoys. It is a retrospective award and was formally approved by The Queen last year. No presentation ceremony comes with the medal, so both men received their honours from the postman. But when staff at Trinity Church, in Gosforth, where both men attend different 90-plus events, heard of their awards, they decided to stage a proper ceremony. Friends and family gathered in the church this week to watch as Lieutenant Commander Duncan Young, executive officer of the Royal Navy's HMS Calliope, presented them with their awards. Dr Dias, 90, was just 16 when he started in the Merchant Navy after being educated at a cadet school. He was quickly brought into the Navy, where he served in what he described as 'frightening' missions during the Second World War. Members of a British destroyer clear the frozen deck of the ship during an Arctic convoy in the Second World War . He said: 'It was a very hairy time . and we were right at the front from start to finish. I had a wonderful . view of it from the bridge of HMS Rodney. The Arctic convoys of the Second World War were described by Winston Churchill as 'the toughest journey, the worst journey in the world'. The convoys sailed from the UK, Iceland, and North America to ports in the Soviet Union - modern day Russia. There were a total of 78 convoys between August 1941 and May 1945 sailing via several seas of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. About 1,400 merchant ships delivered vital supplies to the Soviet Union, escorted by ships of the Royal Navy, Royal Canadian Navy, and the US Navy. Eighty-five merchant vessels and 16 Royal Navy warships were lost. The Nazi German Kriegsmarine lost a number of vessels including one battleship, three destroyers and at least 30 U-boats as well as a large number of aircraft. The gruelling journeys endured by British servicemen involved had never been formally recognised until last year when the Arctic Star medal was introduced. 'It was a very busy war and very frightening. I did what I had to do to survive and thanking God that I was here. 'I was hoping that if I was going to be wounded that it would be quick.' Mr Usher joined the Royal Navy as a volunteer when he was 18, and after his training he joined the 846 Avenger Squadron, which saw him assigned to a number of different ships. But the hardy 89-year-old didn't let the extreme conditions, both in terms of the weather and the constant attacks from the enemy, get the better of the mission at hand. Mr Usher, who lives with wife Gwen, said: 'We made the most of it. There was one horrible day on the way to Russia when this Avenger crashed and exploded. There was petrol all over the place. A man was carried into the hangar, but he had already been burned to death. He was buried at sea.' He added: 'Our convoy was the first to get through to Russia without losing one ship of supplies.' Dr Dias and Mr Usher were praised by Lt Cdr Young when he handed them their Arctic Stars. He said: 'I am humbled to have been given the great honour of presenting two Arctic Convoy medals. I think it is a disgrace that they came through the post, so the Royal Navy is delighted to present them properly.' The ceremony was organised by Mary Bellshaw, pastoral and community worker at Trinity Church, and also featured a performance by choir Northern Lights.","Wing Commander Ken Wallis flew his plane over Germany on 28 missions .

"As she sipped her gin and tonic at 30,000ft, Lamenda Kingdon chatted to a fellow passenger about how much she was looking forward to visiting Spain. She was aghast when her neighbour replied: ‘Not on this plane, you won’t.’ It was then that the grandmother discovered that, rather than heading for the historic city of Granada, her flight was bound for the Caribbean island of Grenada. Bucket list: Lamenda Kingdon had planned her trip to Granada in Spain as part of a 'bucket list' of activities after she was diagnosed with breast cancer and a brain tumour . Thanks to a misunderstanding, instead of booking the 62-year-old on a two-hour flight to southern Spain, the air miles travel firm Avios had put her on a ten-hour journey across the Atlantic. Mrs Kingdon had planned her trip to Granada, with its famous Alhambra palace, as part of a ‘bucket list’ of activities after she was diagnosed with breast cancer and a brain tumour. She booked the flight over the phone using her late husband’s air miles and did not notice when the ticket arrived that the destination was one letter different – and some 4,000 miles away – from the place she wanted to go to. Mrs Kingdon, a former life coach from Plymouth, packed her bags and boarded her British Airways flight at Gatwick last month, oblivious to the mistake until two hours after take-off. ‘After lunch and a gin and tonic I began to chatting to the lady sitting next to me,’ she said. ‘I told her how much I was looking forward to seeing the Alhambra. ‘She replied: “Not on this flight, you won’t be.” ‘She then grabbed the elbow of a passing stewardess and told her: “This lady thinks she’s going to Spain.” ‘I looked at the ticket and it did indeed say Grenada. I had noticed the departure and arrival times were vastly different – but I presumed that had something to do with the time difference.’ The sympathetic flight crew ushered Mrs Kingdon into the first-class cabin and gave her champagne. At a scheduled stop in St Lucia, she was put on a flight back to Gatwick. Dream holiday: The grandmother had been looking forward to her trip to the historic city of Granada, with its famous Alhambra palace (above) There, she was met by apologetic airline . staff who put her in a hotel for the night and arranged for Avios, which . has links to BA, to reimburse her points and fly her to Malaga, the . nearest major airport to Granada, the following day. Avios also apologised for the mistake and gave Mrs Kingdon enough points for her next dream destination – New Zealand. Since her return from Granada, Mrs Kingdon has been given the all clear by her cancer doctors and hopes to make the trip next year. Shock: However, she was aghast to discover her flight was bound for the Caribbean island of Grenada . ‘Looking back on the Granada mix up, I genuinely don’t blame anyone,’ she said yesterday. ‘The person on the other end of the phone probably just misheard me. I honestly didn’t notice the spelling difference. 'But I’m certainly not complaining. They treated me wonderfully once they found out what had happened.’","Lamenda Kingdon, 62, thought she was on a flight to Granada in Spain .

"A lawyer who confessed to fleecing friends and family with a $5million Ponzi scheme in a suicide note - then survived his attempt to drown himself - has been charged with fraud. Former corporate lawyer Charles Bennett, 56, jumped into the Hudson river in New York City last month, but was saved by police divers. Before making the suicide attempt, Bennett had written a lengthy suicide note confessing to establishing the scheme under the guise of a genuine investment portfolio, then blowing the money to fund his own 'absurd' lifestyle. Suicide attempt: Charles Bennett threw himself into the Hudson river last month, after writing a note confessing to starting a $5million Ponzi scheme . Bennett, who was arrested Friday at the hospital where he was recovering and charged with wire and securities fraud. In the note he said: 'I have systematically over the course of five years or so perpetrated a huge Ponzi scheme... I managed to completely squander the hard earned money that my family and dear friends managed to set aside over the course of their working lives. According to the New York Daily News, Bennett wrote that the returns he paid to some investors were 'an illusion - again not one trade was ever done. It was a Ponzi scheme pure and simple.' Assistant U.S. Attorney Amy Lester argued unsuccessfully that Bennett be held without bail during an unusual remote court appearance in which the prosecution and Magistrate Judge Kevin N. Fox spoke into a cellular telephone from Manhattan federal court as Gatto and Bennett did the same from his hospital room. Lester said Bennett's fraud from at least 2008 until last month was revealed in a 16-page handwritten suicide note. She said he had cheated at least 30 friends and family members out of millions of dollars, sometimes entire life savings. 'This defendant has already demonstrated he's willing to take a great risk — some might say he took the ultimate risk — to avoid facing prosecution by attempting to commit suicide,' Lester said. One of his tactics to gain more investors was reportedly to say former New York governor Eliot Spitzer had signed up - an alleged lie for which he is also being charged. Spitzer called the scheme 'a horrific act by someone who pretended to have a relationship that did not exist and who lured unwitting investors into a Ponzi scheme.' Spitzer's ex-wife, Silda Wall Spitzer, said in a statement: 'We worked together at Skadden Arps. This is astonishing and heartbreaking on all counts.' Gatto argued vigorously that Bennett not be shackled to his bed. She said he had suffered anxiety and depression and felt remorse. She said he had swallowed a lot of water, had undergone surgery and suffered pneumonia soon after he was transferred to a psych ward. 'I'm worried that this man is going to have a terrible setback,' she said, adding that even bail-hearing talk of being shackled to his bed without bail had noticeable effects. 'I can see my client's blood pressure rising, his breathing becoming more shallow.' After New York City police rescued Bennett, officers recovered a handwritten suicide note signed by Bennett titled: 'A Sad Ending to My Life,' a criminal complaint said.","Charles Bennett, 56, jumped in the Hudson river last month and left note .

"Los Angeles police have been accused of resorting to 'street justice' in the hunt for suspected killer ex-cop Christopher Dorner, after they mistakenly shot a 71-year-old woman delivering newspapers and left her truck riddled with bullets. The victim, Emma Hernandez, said the officers did not give any warning or commands and just began firing at her blue pickup truck, according to her attorney. Her 47-year-old daughter was a passenger in the car at the time. 'Tragically, we believe this is a case of mistaken identity,' Charlie Beck, chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, said about the incident. Bullet riddled: Law enforcement officers look over bullet riddled pick-up truck after they mistakenly shot Emma Hernandez in the hunt for Chris Dorner . Victim: Emma Hernandez, left, was shot twice in the back and was hospitalized in stable condition . Injured: The driver's daughter, 47-year-old Maggie Carranza, right, was a passenger in the truck and was injured by broken glass . Hernandez was shot twice in the back and was hospitalized in stable condition. Her daughter, Margie Carranza, was a passenger in the truck at the time of the shooting. She was wounded by glass from the shattered window. The two women were distributing copies of the Los Angeles Times before the terrifying incident. They were driving an aqua blue Toyota Tacoma unlike the description of the Dorner's vehicle, a gray Nissan Titan. When police began firing and gunshots entered through the back windshield of the truck, the terrified women just 'covered their faces and huddled down,' the attorney for the two victims told the Los Angeles Times. The police gunfire came from officers who were protecting a department captain and his family who had been included on the fugitive's hit list. Six LAPD officers who had fired at Hernandez's vehicle have been placed on administrative leave. Mistake: Police thought the blue pickup truck driven by Emma Hernandez belonged to the suspected shooter on the loose . Hit: The 71-year-old driver was shot in the back. Her daughter was a passenger in the car and was injured by broken glass . Wanted: Los Angeles Police believe Christopher Dorner is responsible for killing three people and officers have launched a massive search for the former cop . The women's lawyer, Glen Jonas, told . the Times LAPD not follow protocol or the rules of engagement before . they decided to exercise deadly force. 'With no warning, no command, or no instructions, LAPD opened fire on their vehicle,' Jonas said. 'This wasn't even close,' their attorney said. 'This was two petite Latina women . versus a large black man, with a different vehicle, different color. The . police didn't take the time to do the identification.  They didn't . give  the ""suspect"" the opportunity to surrender. So the whole thing was . just mishandled, and we expect that the city will acknowledge that and . go from there.' LAPD Cmdr. Andrew . Smith says the department's Chief Charlie Beck met with the women in . their Torrance home Saturday to apologize and tell them he had arranged . for someone to donate a new pickup truck. The truck will be donated early this week, Smith said. Dorner, who is wanted in connection . to three homicides, has been described as 'armed and extremely . dangerous' and residents have been told to be vigilant and report any . sightings. On Friday, police put the area of Big Bear about 100 miles from Los Angeles, on lockdown as they searched the alleged shooter. Mistake: Police also shot at this black Honda pickup just minutes after mistaking Hernandez's blue truck for the vehicle belonging to Dorner . Suspect: Police believe Dorner was last driving this gray Nissan Titan . Police . bloodhounds and heavily-armed SWAT officers in combat fatigues tracked a . set of footprints in the snow and 125 cops checked every home in the . community of about 400. It's . been more than a day since there's been a confirmed sighting, leading . investigators to worry Dorner is far away from California. Hernandez was driving a pickup truck . at 5:30am, which police mistook it for the vehicle that belonged to . Dorner and the officers began firing bullets into the blue truck. Just . moments after the first shooting at around 5:45am, police located . another pickup truck, which was a dark color, and began shooting at it. A male passenger inside the truck was not hit. Hernandez and her daughter are expected to recover from their injuries but have retained an attorney. 'There was no warning, there was no orders or no commands… just gunshots,' Jonas told KTLA-TV. Their attorney said that the blue truck was 'the wrong color and the wrong model' compared to the description of Dorner's car. Suspect: Christopher Dorner is seen on a surveillance video at an Orange County hotel on January 28, 2013 in this new surveillance footage released by the Irvine Police Department on Friday . Alert: Police commissioned a billboard to warn residents to report any sightings of former LAPD Officer Christopher . He . accused police of not taking 'the time to notice that these two older, . small Latina women didn’t look like a large black man.' 'We trust that the LAPD will step up . and do the right thing and acknowledge that what they did was . unacceptable and we'll deal with it,' Jonas said. He said his clients were 'extremely traumatized.' They’re just trying to make sense of what happened. From their perspective, they’re sitting in a car, doing their job and a thunderstorm of bullets comes down.' Dorner is wanted in connection to three homicides. He could be anywhere at this point,' San Bernadino County Sheriff John McMahon said. Police . admit Dorner is highly trained and well-versed in their tactics and he . has promised 'to bring unconventional and asymmetrical warfare to those . in LAPD uniform whether on or off duty.' Dorner . is presumed to be armed with multiple weapons, including an assault . rifle, although his manifesto suggests he may be more heavily armed - . possibly even with rocket launchers. 'Do . not deploy airships or gunships. SA-7 Manpads will be waiting,' he said . in his manifesto, referencing a Russian-made shoulder-launched missile . launcher. Let's talk: Charlie Sheen has posted a video encouraging Christopher Dorner to turn himself in . Dorner, who received medals for his service during the Iraq war, also earned accolades for his shooting skills. He earned a rifle marksman ribbon and pistol expert medal, CBS reported. He was also deployed to Bahrain and Kuwait in 2006 and 2007 as part of the Naval reserve. On Sunday he allegedly murdered the . daughter and future son-in-law of former LAPD Captain Randy Quan, who . defended him at the disciplinary hearing where he was expelled from the . police force. Then on Thursday he launched a shooting spree, that claimed the life of a 34-year-old police trainer with 11-years on the force. Hell raising actor Charlie Sheen has urged the fugitive former LAPD to contact him. Dorner . had mentioned Sheen along with a number of other celebrities in his . online manifesto which also indicates his intentions to kill more . people. Manhunt: Law enforcement search for fugitive Christopher Dorner near Big Bear, Calif. through the snow . In the manifesto, Dorner wrote: ‘Charlie Sheen, you’re effin awesome.’ In a 17-second video message posted on Saturday on the TMZ website, Sheen seems to suggest that he is willing to mediate between Dorner and the police. Dressed in a black shirt and speaking in short, direct sentences Sheen thanks Dorner for his 'kind words' and then asks the man to call him. Hunt continues: A U.S. Forest Service Law Enforcement officer searches a home in Big Bear Lake . Searching: Clear skies allowed aircraft with heat-sensing technology to aid scores of officers searching in the snow-covered San Bernardino Mountains . 'Let's figure out together how to end this thing,' Sheen is recorded saying.

"A 17-year-old Delaware boy has been accused of shooting his father dead with a crossbow because he was caught skipping school. Seth Ramsey has been charged with the first degree murder of Todd, 41, who was found dead in a bedroom of the family home in Harrington. According to law enforcement, the younger Ramsey said his father had been in his bedroom and knew he had skipped classes at Lake Forest High School in Harrington, Delaware. Detained: Seth Ramsey, 17, has been accused of killing his father with a crossbow while he had skipped school. He allegedly thought he would be mad that he had stayed home . Fearing he would be mad, he shot him with the weapon as he entered the room. According to the police affidavit obtained by ABC 6, the teen told police he missed school on Tuesday. Authorities were first alerted by the victim's co-workers visited who said he had not been at work for work for a couple of days. They then arrived at his house where one of them supposedly spoke to the youngster who claimed he had killed his father. It read: 'He said that his father was in his bedroom from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Seth said that he knew when his father came out he would be mad so he shot him.' He is being held at a juvenile detention facility without bail. Ramsey was also charged with weapon possession during commission of a felony. During an official statement, Master Cpl. Gary E. Fournier said that no motive had been established for the deaths. On Facebook, the father and son shared photos of them playing baseball together. It is unclear who they lived with at the address and whether anyone else was in the house at the time.

"The good news for Watford is that every team to top the Championship after 15 games in the last seven years has gone on to win promotion. The bad is that it was they who last failed. Clayton Donaldson’s double - giving Birmingham just their third win of the season - will have Hornets worried that fate may befall them again. Aidy Boothroyd was in charge back in 2007 when they spluttered and faltered, gone a year later. With the trigger happy fingers of the Pozzo family, it’s hard to envisage Slavisa Jokanovic - their latest incumbent - remaining at Vicarage Road if he doesn’t deliver Premier League football inside six months. The Serbian is already the fourth in the  hotseat this campaign - although Oscar Garcia left on medical advice - and, despite leading the way, they don’t seem a side totally sure of themselves. It is a miracle they have kept consistent with such upheaval. Birmingham's Clayton Donaldson celebrates scoring the winner against Watford . Donaldson rises highest to head home his and Birmingham's second goal of the night . Birmingham (4-2-3-1): Randolph 6; Caddis 7.5, Morrison 7, Robinson 6, Grounds 6.5; Davis 6.5, Gleeson 6.5; Arthur 7 (Gray 74 - 6), Shinnie 6 (Thomas 79 - 6), Cotterill 7; Donaldson 8.5 . Subs not used: Doyle, Eardley, Edgar, Shea, Reilly . Scorer: Donaldson 2, 85 . Watford (4-3-2-1): Gomes 6; Paredes 6, Hoban 5, Ekstrand 6, Doyley 6; McGugan 6, Tozser 6, Anya 6.5; Forestieri 7.5 (Vydra 75 - 6), Ighalo 6.5 (Andrews 59 - 6); Deeney 6.5 . Subs not used: Bond, Cathcart, Pudil, Dyer, Murray . Scorer: Forestieri 7 . ‘It’s not a good result,’ Jokanovic bemoaned. ‘We had possession of the ball but played very slowly.’ But the night really belonged to home debutant Gary Rowett and his Birmingham side - one to have languished so badly just weeks ago under Lee Clark. Remarkably this was only their second home win in over 12 months and you could tell when the final whistle eventually blew. The jubilant new boss - who has breathed fresh life into this part of the Midlands already - span with clenched fists to his bench; St Andrew’s roared ferociously, and it’s been a while since that last happened. The relief was palpable. Rowett was keen to remain grounded. ‘We kept control and played with discipline,’ he said. ‘We’ve had 18 shots on goal against a team top of the league. But this just the start. It showed what we could do.' Under Clark Birmingham were dreadful at home - barely capable of stringing passes together let alone a sustained run of results. What Rowett is doing is bringing the feelgood factor back. Watford's Troy Deeney  is tracked by Paul Robinson  of Birmingham during the Championship encounter . Watford's Fernando Forestieri scored the equalising goal before Donaldson's winner . 'They were ready to get behind something tonight,' the manager added. 'There had been a bit of fear beforehand. It should be enjoyable to go out there and play in front of that crowd.' He has engineered an immediate reaction with four points from his first two games, and they set off meaning business here. Koby Arthur saw a menacing strike blocked in the opening seconds before Donaldson - who had scored just twice all season - latched on to a Stephen Gleeson cross to prod in the opener inside two minutes. They weren’t ahead for long. Watford pressed, Darren Randolph did excellently to thwart the unmarked Fernando Forestieri’s effort, but the rebound fell back to the Argentine to level up just five later. Parity, and quickly. But Rowett has instilled an impressive steel in a week. What’s also clear is that the 40-year-old’s enthusiasm is infectious. When Andy Shinnie somehow headed over, the boss dashed to the touchline to applaud Paul Caddis’ centre rather than pout. They aren’t used to that around these parts. Randolph made a stunning one-handed save to deny a vicious Troy Deeney thump, but the Blues always looked more likely. Sustained pressure paid with five minutes left on the clock - Donaldson, all alone six yards out, planting a header beyond former Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes to give hope to a club who appeared to have none.","Gary Rowett saw his side claim their third win of the season .

"The 11-month-old boy whose mother was found dead in the refrigerator of her Houston apartment has been found safe in Mexico with his father, who has been taken into custody as a suspect in the killing. Houston PD cops say that Patrick Lambert, 38, and his son Achilles are awaiting return to the United States. Lambert has not been charged in his wife Anastacia Lambert's death. Baby Achilles, 11 months old, is being brought back to the United States after he was found abandoned in Mexico. He was in 'good condition,' authorities said . Patrick Lambert (right) is the main suspect in the killing of his wife Anastacia (left). Cops say he disappeared with their son Achilles not long after her death . Tiny Achilles was found in Queretaro, in central Mexico, where his father abandoned him. He was in 'good condition,' Mexican authorities said. Patrick was found in a separate location and taken into custody. Anastacia's body was found Monday after a foul odor led a maintenance worker to a second-floor unit at the Brawswood Oaks apartment complex in Houston. The 27-year-old mother was stabbed to death and her body stuffed in a refrigerator. A foul odor led a maintenance worker to Anastacia Lambert's body, which was stuffed inside this refrigerator in the Houston apartment she shared with Patrick and their son . Mexican authorities said Achilles was in 'good condition' when they found him . It is unclear how long she had been dead, but detectives said it could have been as long as three weeks. The stench was noticeable because the apartment's power was turned off on Nov. 20 after the utility bills weren't paid. Anastacia had not been seen in a week. Nobody realized she was missing because she didn't have family in the area and was currently unemployed, KHOU.com reported. The hunt for Patrick had been slowed down because police didn't know what kind of vehicle he was driving and had no license plates, according to the website. The couple had lived in several places, including Florida, New York and Hawaii. They moved . to the apartment in Houston in June. Police said Anastacia called 911 three months ago and said her husband was threatening her . with a knife, KHOU.com reported. Officers responded to the call but no charges were filed.","Little 11-month-old Achilles is in 'good condition' after disappearing from Houston with his dad Patrick Lambert .

"Figures released by Eric Pickles' Department for Communities and Local Government show around one in 10 local authority home is now occupied by foreign tenants . Around one in ten local authority homes were let last year to foreign tenants, figures showed last night. The proportion has soared since David Cameron entered Downing Street. Last year, 9 per cent of social housing properties which were let out were occupied by foreign tenants – up from 6 per cent in the final year of the last Labour government. The statistics, released by Eric Pickles’ Department for Communities and Local Government, show that this proportion of lettings is the highest in England since at least 2006/7. The figures also show that the number of homes let out to Eastern Europeans had doubled since the Coalition was formed in 2010 to 4 per cent. The DCLG document said this could be down to the fact that Britain’s borders have been opened to Bulgarians and Romanians. The figures are another problem for David Cameron as he struggles to persuade voters the Conservatives can get to grips with immigration. Ministers have already been forced to admit they will not meet the election pledge to cut net migration to the tens of thousands by next eyar. Latest figures show that annual net migration is now at 260,000 – higher than when they took office. Last month, Mr Cameron unveiled proposals to prevent migrants from accessing social housing until they have been paying tax in this country for at least four years. The increase was condemned by the cross-party Commons group on balanced migration, chaired by Labour’s Frank Field and the Tories’ Sir Nicholas Soames. In a statement, they said: ‘The proportion of social housing going to non-British nationals continues to increase. ‘This nationwide figure of one in ten disguises local variations where the impact has been much higher. A stronger priority for social housing should be given to long-standing local residents.’ The DCLG document, Social Housing Lettings, said that 91 per cent of social properties are occupied by UK nationals and 4 per cent by Eastern Europeans – that is people from Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. A further 1 per cent are occupied by people from other EU countries, and 4 per cent by other non-UK nationals. The Local Government Association, pictured above, said ‘It is in everyone’s interest to remove unnecessary barriers which prevent homes being made available to those people who desperately need them' ‘The proportion of tenants who were UK nationals fell by 1 percentage point a year from 2009/10 to 2012/13 and remained static in 2013/14, whilst those from A8 countries has rsien slowly from 1 per cent in 2007/08 to 4 per cent in 2013/14,’ the document said. ‘A factor in this could be that since 2008/9, the list of A8 countries has expanded to include Bulgaria and Romania.’ A8 countries are Eastern European countries who joined the EU in 2004. They do not include Bulgaria and Romania, who joined later. A spokesman for the Local Government Association said: ‘It is in everyone’s interest to remove unnecessary barriers which prevent homes being made available to those people who desperately need them. ‘Councils are keen to play their part in this and could go further and faster to support the development of badly needed new homes if Government gave councils greater financial flexibility.’ Housing minister Brandon Lewis said that the figures would fall next year after new measures introduced by the government. ‘These figures do not take account of the new guidance we’ve put in place to ensure councils are completely clear about who they have given social homes to, so communities can be confident they are not losing out,’ he said. ‘For years families suffered the blatant unfairness of watching as people with no job or connection to the local area were given council homes. Under this Government new rules make crystal clear that local people and members of the Armed Forces are at the front of the queue for council homes in their area. ‘As a result, I expect next year’s figures to change as councils put these rules into practice.’","One in 10 new local authority homes now let out to tenant born outside UK .

"As well as having fame, fortune and stellar acting careers in common, Jessica Alba, Eva Mendes and Kate Beckinsale all possess goddess-like bodies too. And now, the secret weapon behind the famous trio's sculpted physiques has been revealed and she's shared her top tips for getting an A-list body with FEMAIL. Ramona Braganza is the personal trainer and nutritionist behind some of Hollywood’s hottest bodies, including Jessica Alba, Scarlett Johansson, Eva Mendes, Kate Beckinsale, Anne Hathaway and even Zac Efron. Scroll down for video . Get the look: The woman behind Jessica Alba, left, and Eva Mendes' enviable bodies has shared her fitness and nutritional tips with FEMAIL . Ramona is name-checked by celebrities as the go-to trainer when they only have a short time to prepare their body and she claims she can transform figures from head-to-toe in just six weeks. Over the course of her career, Ramona has whipped hundreds of bodies into shape and has gained a cult following for her 3-2-1 training method, which includes three cardio segments, two circuit strength training and one core segment. The method, she explains, is designed to add long, lean definition to her female clients and strength and size to her male clients. Ramona said: 'Women sometimes shy away from strength training, because they worry it will make them bulk up. However my famous 3-2-1 training method is based on strength training and I always recommend lifting weights to my clients, including Jessica Alba, Halle Berry and most recently Paula Patton, and they still look shapely and feminine.' He's got Ramona to thank for that! Ramona has gained a cult following for her 3-2-1 training method, which includes three cardio segments, two circuit strength training and one core segment, which the likes of Zac Efron follow . Workout buddy: Ramona, who works with Zac Efron,  emphasises the importance of training smarter not longer. She says working hard for 30-45 minutes is better than exercising for longer periods (anything over and hour) and risking overtraining . Ramona shared her step-by-guide to achieving a celebrity body in a few simple steps. It all starts with pre-workout fuel and, she says, if you aren't eating the right foods before you hit the gym, you may be sabotaging your workouts. 'Eating the right foods at the right times will make a difference in the way you gain muscle tissue,' she says. 'Make sure you have a snack pre-workout such as rolled oats, eggs and toast, or if on the go, a handful of almonds or a protein shake like Everything But the Cow - it is a blend of soya protein and real fruit and will give you the energy you need to work hard. 'Giving your body what it needs includes restoring a natural balance. Training hard produces stress which in turn, creates free radicals which attack healthy tissue in the body. To help your body fight these free radicals, ensure you have a healthy intake of fruit and vegetables each day such as broccoli, berries and cherries.' A-list clients: Ramona, pictured, left, with Scarlett Johansson and, right, with Eva Mendes, believes that women should lift weights, as daunting as it may be . Helping Halle: Ramona says Miss  Berry has learned to control her diabetes by limiting her carbohydrates to ones that do not cause a rapid rise in sugar levels, which also has the added benefit of weight control . Ramona says there are no excuses for not working out and if you suddenly find yourself away from a gym, then don’t skip a workout just because you don’t have any equipment. 'Try combinations that include single-legged squats, single-arm pushups, walking squats and sit-ups. A full-body workout can get you the sweat you need in 10 minutes,' she said. She also emphasises the importance of training smarter not longer. 'If you are one of those people that believes they need to spend as much as ten hours a day in the gym then I have news for you: It is better to train in an efficient effective manner at an intensity level that challenges you, say 30-45 minutes than exercising for longer periods (anything over and hour) and risking overtraining. Overtraining can break down muscle tissue and can even lead to injury over time,' she said. She also believes that women should lift weights, as daunting as it may be. 'I often see ladies in the gym not lifting enough weight. They are afraid of bulking up, but if not enough weight is lifted then not enough stress is put on the muscle to make a change,' she said. 'Women don’t need to worry about bulking up; hormonally women don’t have enough testosterone to look like men. Halle Berry, Jessica Alba and Kate Beckinsale and all lift weights and none look bulky but instead are enviably toned.' And while most of us use the scales to track our progress, Ramona says that number tells only half the story. 'Our body composition reveals ratio of fat to lean muscle tissue and while muscle weighs more than fat, it looks better on a body and it burns calories even while we sleep, so step away from the scales and trust how you feel in your clothes and in yourself.' Ramona also emphasises the important of rest and recovery  - a time to rebuild muscle tissue and recharge energy supplies. She advises her clients to  train three days on and one day off. It sure works! Ramona's method, she explains, is designed to add long lead definition to her female clients and strength and size to her male clients . Speaking about working with Jessica Alba, Ramona said: 'I can tell you that she’s just like everyone else. Jessica has had to work at it by exercising and eating right. 'What Jess understands is the 80/20 rule. While it’s fun to occasionally go for fancy diners, have dessert and a glass of wine, it’s equally important to prepare most of your meals during the week. 'Jessica has always enjoyed cooking. She knows that by doing so she can control what goes into her food. She eats plenty of fruits and vegetables and enjoys most dishes. Jessica eats only until she is full then puts the fork down. 'Once you are able to eat in moderation, use portion control and make consistent healthy choices most of the time.' When it comes to food, Ramona also believes that you should limit your carbohydrates to whole fruit, whole vegetable, whole grain breads, muffins, bagels, rolls, pasta, noodles, crackers, cereal, and brown rice and quinoa. 'Halle Berry has learned to control her diabetes by limiting her carbohydrates to ones that do not cause a rapid rise in sugar levels, this has had the added benefit of weight control',' she said. 'My final word to you is to commit to your goals, begin your plan and stick to it and you can achieve anything including looking hot like my Hollywood celebrities! 'It's within your reach it's all up to you to get the body you have always longed for!'

"Tom Heaton bailed out Burnley with a rare penalty save against Southampton and then backed one of the Premier League relegation favourites to rescue themselves from the drop. The former Manchester United goalkeeper brilliantly turned away an effort from Dusan Tadic, who became the first Saints player to fail from the spot in the Premier League in 30 attempts stretching back more than 17 years. Burnley, who appeared to be doomed a month ago, took full advantage as a deflected winner from Ashley Barnes lifted them out of the relegation zone. Dusan Tadic saw his penalty saved for Southampton by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton . Heaton dives to his left to save the penalty and he believes Burnley can survive the drop this season . Tadic shows his frustration after missing a penalty for his side, who eventually lost 1-0 on Saturday . 29 - Dusan Tadic’s miss ended a run of 29 consecutive Premier League penalties scored by Southampton. Sean Dyche’s team have now picked up 11 points from the last six games, and Heaton insists they have the belief to survive in the top-flight. ‘Obviously staying in the league is going to be success for us and we feel that we’ve got a great chance of being successful,’ he said. ‘We think it’s a great challenge, a great opportunity for us. ‘To be honest, we always felt we were not far off. Even when we didn’t win for the first 10 games we had the belief to turn things around. Once we got one it sort of opened the floodgates and gave us a bit of freedom. We’ve got back to what we’re all about.’ While Burnley are on the rise, Southampton’s season has suddenly gone in the opposite direction. This was their fourth defeat in a row after losing to Arsenal and both Manchester clubs, even though Ronald Koeman’s team stay in fifth. The Dutchman will be looking for an immediate reaction from his team when they play at Sheffield United on Tuesday in the quarter-finals of the Capital One Cup. ‘It will be a massive occasion,’ said midfielder James Ward-Prowse. ‘We are desperate to turn around the run we are on at the moment and get back to winning ways, and I don’t think there is any better opportunity than the quarter-final of the cup.’ Ashley Barnes bundled the ball home from close range to give Burnley a valuable win against Southampton .

"It was not your average Christmas newsletter for a Church of England primary school. Marked ‘staff changes’, it began conventionally enough, informing parents that Mrs Metcalfe was leaving for a new teaching position in Spain. It explained that ‘Miss Wharmby will be teaching Year 1 full-time’ and that ‘Mrs Kelly will be reducing her hours’. But the sixth paragraph came as a bit of a shock. ‘Mr Upton has recently made a significant change in his life and will be transitioning to live as a woman,’ it read. ‘After the Christmas break, she will return to work as Miss Meadows.’ It then said the school was ‘proud of our commitment to equality and diversity among our staff and children’. Yesterday parents at St Mary Magdalen’s Primary School in Accrington, Lancashire, were coming to terms with the fact the popular Year 6 teacher previously known as Nathan Upton – a father-of-one who until recently was married – is now Lucy Meadows. They told how pupils had been informed that the 32-year-old felt he had been ‘born with a girl’s brain in a boy’s body’. However some complained that their children were too young to understand how ‘Sir’ could become ‘Miss’ almost overnight and were confused and upset. Mr Upton married Ruth Smith in 2009 and the couple had a son, now aged three. He joined the school around the same time and, according to parents, began growing his cropped hair and dying it purple, painting his nails pink and wearing sparkly headbands. A crayon drawing of Mr Upton by a pupil posted on the school’s website shows him with hair swept back over his shoulders. ‘At first we thought he was just borrowing his wife’s headbands to hold his hair back,’ said one parent. ‘I saw what I thought was Mr Upton dressed as a woman in town one weekend, but I decided I’d imagined it.’ Mr Upton is understood to be in the early stages of ‘gender reassignment’, living as a woman before deciding to proceed with a full sex change. St Mary Magdalen's School in Accrington have asked pupils to address teacher Nathan Upton as Miss Meadows from the start of the Spring term . A drawing by a school pupil of Mr Upton posted on the school's website complete with long hair . The school’s 169 pupils were informed class-by-class on Monday, and at the same time the newsletter was hand-delivered to parents. In a statement, Mr Upton said: ‘This has been a long and difficult journey for me, and it was certainly not an easy decision to make.’ Thanking the school for its support, he added: ‘I’d now ask for my privacy to be respected so that I can continue with my job, which I’m committed to and which I enjoy very much.’ Headmistress Karen Hardman said: ‘We understand that an issue such as this is bound to arouse interest for a short while. 'However, this is a personal matter for our staff member, who has our full support, and we are all working together to ensure it has the least impact on the smooth running of our school.’ Mr Upton’s wife – who served as a governor at St Mary Magdalen’s – has left their terraced home close to the school. But her parents, Geoff and Hazel Smith, said that while his decision to live as a woman had come as a huge shock, they were standing by him. ‘We love him and her very much,’ said Mr Smith, 71. ‘We will support him no matter what.’ A ten-year-old pupil said: ‘He spoke to us and said he’s going to be changing into a woman and wearing women’s clothes after Christmas. 'We were all a bit shocked.’ Wayne Cowie, whose ten-year-old son has been taught by Mr Upton for three years, said his children were worried and confused. ‘My middle boy thinks that he might wake up with a girl’s brain because he was told that Mr Upton, as he got older, got a girl’s brains,’ the  35-year-old decorator said. ‘He’s a great teacher, but my kids are too young to be told about the birds and the bees like this.’ Mr Cowie said his son had been told he would be punished if he continued to refer to the teacher as ‘Mr Upton’ next term. Another parent said: ‘This is totally inappropriate. ‘Any teacher who is going to change gender should also change schools.’ A school spokesman said pupils wouldn’t be punished for referring to the teacher as Mr Upton, but added they would be ‘expected to behave properly around her’. Father Wayne Kelly is angry after receiving the letter from St Mary Magdalen's Primary School informing him of his son's teacher's change . The letter sent to the parents by the school informing them of the change . The message was buried at the bottom of a section of 'staff changes'","Nathan Upton, a teacher at St Mary Magdalen's School in Accrington will also dress as a woman from next term .

"For those on death row, it is the last thing they have left to look forward to. But inmates in Texas will no longer be allowed to choose their final meal, after a convicted murderer ordered a massive multi-course dinner. Lawrence Brewer, who was executed on Wednesday, asked for two chicken steaks, a triple bacon cheeseburger, fried okra, three fajitas, a pizza, a pint of ice cream, and a slab of peanut butter fudge with crushed peanuts. He reportedly refused to eat any of the feast once it was delivered. Death sentence: Lawrence Russell Brewer, pictured arriving at court in a bulletproof vest in 1999, was executed last night . Houston State Senator John Whitmire . wrote to the executive director of the Texas Criminal Justice Division . saying that he had long opposed the practice, and that 'enough is . enough.' He said the last meal request is an . 'extremely inappropriate' privilege, 'one which the perpetrator did not . provide to their victim.' Houstonpress.com reports that executive director Brad Livingston agreed with Sen. Whitmire. He said: 'I believe Senator Whitmire's concerns regarding the practice of allowing death row offenders to choose their last meal are valid. 'Effective immediately, no such accommodations will be made. They will receive the same meal served to other offenders on the unit.' Lawrence Brewer, 44, was put to death by lethal injection for his part in the 1998 killing of James Byrd in Jasper, East Texas. Brewer was one of three men convicted of killing Mr Byrd after they offered him a lift along a remote country road. Mr Byrd, 49, was beaten unconscious and . urinated upon before being bound to the vehicle by his ankles with a . heavy logging chain and driven for three miles. Forensic evidence showed that he was . alive for much of the ordeal but was killed when the vehicle hit a . concrete drainage channel causing his head and arm to be ripped from his . body. John William King, 36, was also . convicted of capital murder and sent to death row. His case remains . under appeal. The third man, Shawn Berry, 36, received a life prison . term. Victim: James Byrd Jr died after being chained to the bumper of a pick-up truck by Brewer and two other white supremacists . After dumping his remains in an African-American cemetery his killers drove off to a barbeque. In an interview from death row, Brewer . told KFDM that he participated in the assault on Mr Byrd but had 'nothing . to do with the killing as far as dragging him or driving the truck or . anything’. He told the station his execution would be a 'good out' and he's 'glad it's about to come to an end’. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice said Brewer's family was allowed to see him one last time yesterday morning. He was then taken from the Polunsky Unit in Livingston to an isolation cell in Huntsville where the sentence was carried out. Mr Byrd's death led to the ‘Federal . October 22, 2009 Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr Hate Crimes . Prevention Act’, commonly known as the 'Matthew Shepard Act'. Final hours: Brewer was taken from his cell at the Polunsky Unit in Livingston, Texas, to an isolation cell in Huntsville, Texas, where the sentence was carried out . President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on October 28, 2009. The brutal death put Jasper, a typical . East Texas town with a Dairy Queen, Walmart and a handful of fast-food . places some 60 miles from the nearest interstate highway, under a . national spotlight. 'Everywhere you went, anywhere in the . country, once people found out you were from Jasper, Texas, they wanted . to ask you about it,' said Mike Lout, mayor and the town radio station . owner. 'Everybody first was shocked and . appalled and not proud of it. They talked about it so much in the days . past it, I think most people wanted to put it out of their minds.' 'It's heartbreaking,' said Billy Rowles, who was sheriff at the time of Mr Byrd's murder. 'A lot of effort and hard work and . soul-searching went into trying to live down the stereotype. It's so . easy to get back into that mode.' His huge last meal had echoes of that . enjoyed by Robert Harris in 1992, who killed two teenage boys. He had a . chicken bucket, two large pizzas, a Pepsi six-pack, jelly beans and . Camel cigarettes. The subject of last meals before execution has thrown . up some interesting results over the last few decades, with James Smith . being refused a request of dirt in 1990 and instead eating yoghurt. The horrific killing of James Byrd Jr is seen as one of America's worst racial crimes since the civil rights era. The brutal nature of his death shocked the U.S. and was condemned by the then President Bill Clinton. As . the defendants had served time in prison, their arrests focused . national attention on the prevalence of the white supremacist prison . gangs to which they belonged. Brewer's father claimed his son had joined the gang after being brutalised and abused by black inmates while incarcerated. During . the trial Brewer claimed that although he had been present on the . night, he had not taken part in the killing and blamed the other two - . John King and Shawn Berry, both 24 at the time. He told the jury he 'had no intention of killing nobody'. In . court he claimed King had started a fight with Mr Byrd, and that Mr . Berry had slashed the victim across the throat before chaining him to . the bumper of the pick-up truck. Prosecutors . said they believed Mr Byrd had been killed to promote Brewer and . Berry's white supremacist organisation the Confederate Knights of . America  and to initiate Berry into the group. Brewer admitted joining the group while serving time in a Texan prison with King. Basketball star Dennis Rodman made a . $25,000 donation to a fund started to support Byrd's family. He had . previously offered to pay for the funeral. The . Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act passed . in 2009 expanded the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to . include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, . sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.","Ban comes after hate crime killer's massive 3,500 calorie meal .

"A son went into a rarely-used bedroom in his mother's home and discovered thousands of wasps had made a giant nest in a bed. An estimated 5,000 wasps had created a nest by chewing through bedding, including a blanket and pillow. Pest-control expert John Birkett was called to tackle with the mound of wasps inside the mattress at the five-bedroom home in Winchester, Hampshire. Scroll down for video . An estimated 5,000 wasps were discovered inside the mattress at the home in Winchester, Hampshire . He said: 'In 45 years I have never seen anything like it. There must have been 5,000 wasps. 'It was a job to deal with it. I had to put all my protective gear on. 'At one stage there must have been 2,000 wasps buzzing around me. 'If someone had gone in to the room and not known what it was it would have been pretty serious.' He added: 'They must have started making the nest at the start of May. It's amazing that the woman didn't realise she was living with them. 'We got a call as we normally do, but I thought that it was unusual it was a bedroom. 'I opened the door and I just couldn't believe it. 'The pillow was covered in this three foot wasp nest and they were still busy building the nest. 'I tried to destroy as many as I could with the workers flying around the room. 'The nest came in half so the room was completely full of wasps. I was covered in them. The home-owner was terrified.' Mr Birkett, who runs Longwood Services exterminators, used chemical spray to kill the insects during the two-hour operation. He said the previous biggest nest he had ever found in a bedroom was about the size of a tennis ball. The woman, who did not want to be named, lives alone in the five-bedroom house in the St Cross area of the town. She had not been in the spare room for several months and it was only when her son opened the door that the massive nest was discovered. Last month, an estimated 10,000-strong swarm of bees descended on a sun tent in St Ives, Cornwall . Hornet wasp . colonies reach their peak population in late summer and can contain 700 . large, angry insects. Wasp nests are even bigger and can contain up to . 10,000 insects. The . creatures can mobilise the entire nest to sting in defence of an . attack. Around three in 100 people suffer severe reactions to a wasp or . hornet sting. Last . month, a family were forced to flee Porthmeor beach in St Ives, . Cornwall when an estimated 10,000-strong swarm of bees descended on . their small sun tent and massed inside. Lifeguards cordoned off the area and called in a bee-keeper to collect the insects. Elsewhere, a shopper in Central London was surrounded by a swarm of around 5,000 bees earlier this Summer. The insects descended on a branch of Topshop, which sent the passers-by scrambling for cover. Witnesses said they could ‘hardly see the sky’ as the colony made a nest on the bustling high street. Three days later, in Cambridge, thousands of the insects settled on the figure of Talos in the centre of the city. Two police officers were sent to keep people away and a nearby restaurant closed its doors and windows as a precaution.

"Shocking: Julian Assange speaks from the balcony of the Equador embassy in Knightsbridge in 2012 and police say guarding the building has now cost £6m . Guarding the Ecuadorian embassy in London where Julian Assange has claimed asylum has now cost taxpayers almost £6million, it was revealed today. Metropolitan Police officers have been standing outside the Knightsbridge building since the WikiLeaks founder took refuge there in June 2012 - a vigil costing £11,000 per day. The 42-year-old is wanted in Sweden after allegedly sexually assaulting two women in Stockholm in 2010. For almost two years he lived in the embassy because he fears he will be extradited to America after he enraged the White House by releasing thousands of its secrets in 2010. At all times there are three Scotland Yard officers waiting outside the embassy to arrest him. At least one stands on the steps and others will question visitors leaving in case it is Assange in disguise. All this has cost £5.9million so far, including £1million in overtime costs. Baroness Jenny Jones, deputy chair of the Police and Crime Committee at the London Assembly, condemned the huge cost as 'ludicrous.' She said : 'It is absolute madness. I have been asking the Met questions about this because clearly at the moment the cost is falling on the London taxpayers as a net police cost. 'I have been asking if the Government is going to pay. The Met is apparently trying to claim back some of the money, but of course it is still the taxpayer who is paying for it. 'It is complete madness when we are struggling to keep police officers on the beat.' Costly exercise: Police must stand guard outside the building in case the hacker leaves, but almost two years since he entered Assange has shown no sign of leaving . She said that perhaps the Metropolitan Police should just 'walk away' from the situation. She said : 'I do understand the legal ramifications of the case, but the fact is this is a complete nonsense. 'He could stay there for years. It is a terrible thought, I guess. 'What he did with WikiLeaks was extremely valuable but at the same time evading justice just is not right and either somebody else has to pay - that is, the Swedish authorities - or we just have to back off and stop guarding the embassy. It is ludicrous.' The hacker has endured a self-imposed imprisonment in a single room after being given diplomatic asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London’s Knightsbridge. Assange is still unapologetic about his role in helping to disclose government secrets. The embassy — strewn with red, yellow and blue Ecuadorian flags — takes up a single floor of an imposing block behind Harrods. Initially, Assange slept on an inflatable mattress donated by embassy staff, who are described as having become ‘like family’ to him. But when it became clear his stay was not going to be temporary, a small room was transformed into his living quarters and a bed installed. Life inside: Since June 2012, when he took refuge in the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden on sex charges, Assange has been living a stiflingly claustrophobic existence in a 15ft by 13ft room . He is thought to have stood in direct sunlight for only about 20 minutes during his incarceration, when he emerged on the balcony to address his supporters in August 2012. He has a specially adapted lamp to mimic sunlight in his room — which measures just 15ft by 13ft. Near a Victorian fireplace he has a treadmill donated by the Left-wing film-maker Ken Loach and in his first year at the embassy he notched up 744 miles on the running machine. Revealing the £5.9million cost in a Freedom of Information request, Scotland Yard said the costs included £1million in overtime costs.","Guarding London building has cost £5.9m, including £1m overtime bill .

"Fans of Tom and Jerry are furious two episodes have been removed from the Golden Collection volume two . Fans of the classic cartoon Tom and Jerry are furious two episodes deemed 'inappropriate' because they feature the cat and mouse 'blacked-up' have been removed from a new collection. Warner Brothers' Golden Collection Volume Two was intended to be an uncut series of the popular animation in chronological order. But offending episodes Casanova Cat made in 1951 and Mouse Cleaning from 1948 have been pulled. In both episodes either the cat or mouse is 'blacked-up'. In Casanova Cat Jerry's face is covered in cigar smoke before he is made to do a minstrel dance. The box-set was also meant to go on sale two months ago but has yet made it into shops. Fans have been posting angry messages on websites where you can pre-order the Blu-ray DVD such as Amazon explaining why they won't be buying the discs. One message reads: 'Culture is always reflected in cartoons, and while this may not have been right, it existed. 'It is a shame to omit pieces of history in a collection simply due to PR getting shaky boots over the past.' Another posted: 'These releases are almost exclusively for the adult collector, so why treat us like infants?' A campaign group has also appeared on Facebook called 'Unleash the banned Tom and Jerry cartoons.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

She said at the time: 'Removing these inexcusable images and jokes from this collection would be the same as saying (these prejudices) never existed. 'So they are presented here to accurately reflect a part of our history that cannot and should not be ignored.'

"The former bank boss caught buying crystal meth and crack cocaine has been suspended from the Labour party as Ed Miliband faced questions over hiring him as an advisor. Paul Flowers, a Methodist minister who was chairman of the Co-operative Bank when it ran into trouble, now faces an investigation by the police after being covertly filmed counting off £20 notes to buy hard drugs. Today the Co-operative Group has launched a fact-finding investigation into 'any inappropriate behaviour' at the group or the Co-operative Bank and a 'root-and-branch review' of the structure of the organisation. Caught on camera: The Rev Paul Flowers was filmed counting money for a drugs deal . Until June Flowers was £132,000-a-year chairman of the ‘ethical’ bank, which has lent £34million to Labour over two decades. The Labour party today moved to distance itself from Flowers, suspending the former city councillor for bringing the party into ‘disrepute’. At the weekend he apologised ‘to all I have hurt or failed by my actions’ over the revelations in the Mail on Sunday involving crystal meth, crack cocaine and ketamine. He bragged of getting ‘wasted’ following his grilling by MPs over the near-collapse of the bank. As the scale of the Co-Op Bank’s financial problems emerged this year, Flowers stepped down as chairman and as deputy chairman of the Co-operative Group. The bank lost £700million in the first six months of the year and a £1.5billion black hole was discovered in its finances. As well as being suspended by the Labour Party, he has also been suspended by the Methodist Church. Now the Co-op Group has launched an inquiry into any 'inappropriate behaviour' at the bank or the wider group. The Co-operative group said in a statement: 'Given the serious and wide-ranging nature of recent allegations, the new executive management team has started a fact-finding process to look into any inappropriate behaviour at the Co-operative Group or the Co-operative Bank and to take action as necessary. 'In addition, the board of the Co-operative Group has launched a root and branch review of the democratic structure of the organisation. 'We need to modernise to ensure that the interests of all our seven million members are properly and directly represented in the oversight of our business activities.' Labour leader Ed Miliband defended hiring Flowers to advise him on finance and industry . It is embarrassing for Mr Miliband, who in 2010 appointed Flowers as a member of Labour’s influential finance and industry advisory board. Flowers has been a Methodist minister for almost 40 years and served as a Labour councillor on Bradford City Council, where he lives, for a decade. Today Mr Miliband defended bringing Flowers into the party fold: ‘He was involved in the Co-op and that is no longer the case. I think we will leave it there. ‘You appoint people from a whole range of backgrounds to look at a whole range of issues and we have a range of business people working with us. ‘The police are looking into the matter and I'm not going to comment on an ongoing investigation.’ Flowers bragged of getting 'wasted' following his grilling by MPs over the near-collapse of the bank, which threatens the retirement income of thousands of pensioners . A Labour spokesman added: ‘In the light of recent reports, we have today suspended Paul Flowers as a member of the Labour Party for bringing the party into disrepute.’ Flowers has already been suspended by the Methodist Church. West Yorkshire Police last night confirmed they had begun an inquiry into possible criminal charges against Flowers, who has gone into hiding. The scandal is an acute embarrassment for Labour and its 32 MPs who are sponsored by the Co-op Group. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has received £50,000 in donations from the Co-op, which prides itself on its ethical stance. Ordinarily, the Rev Paul Flowers would have presided over the 10.30am service yesterday at Wibsey Methodist Church. The . gathering at the modern pebble-dashed church outside Bradford, West . Yorkshire, lasts an hour and is followed by tea and biscuits. But . having been caught buying and using illegal drugs including crystal . meth, crack cocaine and ketamine, it would hardly have seemed . appropriate to take the pulpit. Ridicule: The Rev Flowers during the Treasury Select Committee hearing . The Methodist Church appears to agree – Flowers has been suspended from his duties for three weeks. He . has been one of its ministers for 40 years. Laudable, you might say. But does being in such a post really make one a suitable candidate to . become chairman of the Co-operative Bank? Was there something else in Flowers’s CV that qualified him for this most demanding of positions? Well, to be fair, the openly gay Flowers did work for NatWest for four years, in the late 60s. The . position he held is not clear, but given the fact that he was 19 at the . time and became a Methodist minister at the end of his tenure suggests . the post was not a senior one. At . a meeting of the Treasury Select Committee earlier this month, when . asked to explain how he was qualified to run the bank following its . £700million loss he replied: ‘I took the exam of the Institute of . Bankers. ‘I completed part one and the best part of part two of those exams before I became a Methodist minister. ‘I would judge that experience is out of date in terms of the needs of contemporary banking.’ Who would argue with that? Especially given his somewhat shaky grasp of figures. He told the committee that the Co-op’s balance sheet had £3billion of assets, when the answer was in fact £47billion. He was also at a loss to answer questions about the amount of loans on its books. Perhaps . there is some other evidence of financial wizardry, then, in his . background? Yesterday the Mail searched long and hard, but could find . nothing. Paul Flowers was . born in Portsmouth to parents Muriel and Charles but has lived in the . North for many years. His father died in 1993 aged 70, and he had a . brother, Ian, who died the same year aged just 39. He lives in a modest . house in Bradford and shared it with his mother until her death last . year aged 85. Mr Flowers lives in a modest house in Bradford and shared it with his mother until her death last year aged 85 . After that brief stint . with the NatWest, he became a minister with the Methodist Church, for . whom he now sits as a trustee on the body that manages its invested . funds and property. Twenty . or so years ago, Flowers came to attention as vice-chairman of Rochdale . Council’s social services committee during the ‘satanic abuse’ fiasco . between 1988 and 1991. It . involved social workers making lurid claims about satanic rituals being . performed on children and, as a result, 20 children from six families . were placed in care. However, . the police found no evidence and a government-backed inquiry . subsequently blamed ‘evangelical Christians’ for the scare. Flowers maintained a high profile, sitting on committees and getting himself involved in community projects. Ironically, given recent events, from 1992 to 2004 he was prominently . involved with the Lifeline Project, which helps drug abusers. Today he . remains a trustee of the Terrence Higgins Trust, the HIV/Aids charity. Speaking . about his involvement with the charity, he once said: ‘As an out gay . man for all of my adult life I am acutely aware of the issues . surrounding HIV. ‘Like many others I have been personally affected by it in ways which are often far too painful  to recount.’ image.jpg . Flowers was a councillor at Bradford City Council for ten years but does not appear to have been universally popular. One . former councillor told the Mail yesterday: ‘Flowers was an insufferable . and pompous man who threw his not inconsiderable weight around. 'He . always made it plain he was the most educated person in a room and . everyone else was a peasant.’ In 2010 – more irony – he was appointed by . Labour leader Ed Miliband to the party’s finance and industry board. None . of this goes any way to explain just how Flowers became chairman of the . proudly ethical Co-operative Bank. But it seems the system by which the . appointment was made goes some way to solving the mystery. Flowers rose through the Co-op’s ranks, joining the board of the Co-op Group in 2008 and becoming deputy chairman. In . 2009 the post of chairman of Co-operative Banking group became vacant. Choosing the candidate fell to the 13-strong Remuneration and . Appointments Committee, which is formed largely of former Labour . politicians and Co-operative movement veterans. It . traditionally selected directors from the board of the  Co-operative . Group. On that board of about 20 people, you would be unlikely to find . any high-flying bankers. Or . anyone, it seems, remotely up to the job of running a bank. The school . leaver who worked at NatWest 40 years previously was the best they could . find.","Methodist minister Paul Flowers, 63, caught on camera buying drugs .

"When Arizona Cardinals defensive end Darnell Dockett asked Katherine Webb out to a strip club during her now famous appearance on ESPN, he met the wrath of her quarterback boyfriend. And Dockett will no doubt enrage Webb's beau, Alabama player A.J. McCarron, once more - after he claimed: 'I would have got her if I really wanted her.'

'I'm telling you, you quarterbacks, . you get all the good looking women,' veteran sportscaster Brent . Musburger, 73, gushed as the camera stayed on Webb. 'What a beautiful . woman.' She also apparently caught the eye of Dockett, who tweeted: 'When game over, lets go to wing stop then King of diamond' - referring to a strip club.

Dockett told McCarron 'she cute but . not my type' before uploading a photoshopped picture of him with Webb . and McCarron and the caption: 'I was always taught to share your blessings!' He has now spoken about the comical rivalry during an interview with Xtra 910 AM, denying that he was never trying to chat her up - as she simply wasn't his type.

"A thug who attacked his girlfriend in the street has walked free from court after magistrates told him a community sentence is ‘tougher’ than prison. Toby Hayden, 27, hit his partner of two years in a drunken rage when a cash machine told him he had insufficient funds to withdraw money. He repeatedly punched Loretta Butterworth, 22, in an assault that ended only when passers-by heard her screaming ‘please help me’. Loretta Butterworth was left with horrific facial injuries after her boyfriend, Toby Hayden, beat her up . Toby Hayden (left) flew into a rage after being told he had insufficient funds and repeatedly battered Miss Butterworth (right) in the face . When police arrived to arrest Hayden, he spat in the face of one officer and tried to gouge out the eyes of another. But despite being on a suspended . sentence for a previous violent crime, magistrates sentenced him to an . 18-month community order with 200 hours of unpaid work and ordered him . to complete an anger management course. Miss Butterworth, who had once . considered having children with Hayden, said he had ‘no remorse’ and . criticised magistrates for letting him off. She said she looked ‘like a zombie’ after the attack and still has the outline of a footprint on her forehead. She added: ‘When I found out that he had walked free my heart sank. I was shocked and angry. ‘He definitely should have gone to . prison. He had previous convictions, he had been violent to people . before, he was on probation when it happened. ‘He resisted arrest, assaulted two police officers, caused criminal damage and that doesn’t even cover what he did to me. ‘He punched me repeatedly, he didn’t . stop – but that wasn’t enough for him so he kicked me in the back of the . head as I lay on the floor unable to defend myself.’ The couple lived together before the attack but now Miss Butterworth says she thinks Hayden should have gone to prison . Hayden, of Christian Malford, Wiltshire, attacked his girlfriend in nearby Chippenham, as the couple walked home on February 9. He had drunk several shots of tequila and at least eight pints and three cans of lager during the evening. Moses Tawo, defending Hayden, said: . ‘His way of explanation is his alcohol abuse. It isn’t domestic . violence, it is a random assault. He would come back from prison full of . problems and there would be a vicious circle.’ Chippenham magistrates told Hayden: . ‘We are going to take the hard line by not activating the suspension . order. Horfield [Bristol prison] would be the easy option – you could . get this over with in four weeks. But this way you’re going to spend the . next year-and-a-half addressing your behaviour.’ Miss Butterworth, a shop worker, could not open her right eye for weeks after the assault. Sandra Horley, of domestic violence charity Refuge, said Hayden’s sentence was a ‘woefully inadequate punishment’. She said: 'I was shocked to learn of the horrific assault on Loretta Butterworth by her partner. Miss Butterworth has made a good recovery but now lives with her mother . 'It . is appalling that the severity of this crime has not been reflected in . the sentence handed down. A suspended sentence is a woefully inadequate . punishment for a dangerous and violent man like Toby Hayden. 'Domestic . violence is a horrific crime which kills two women every single week in . England and Wales. It must be treated as seriously as any other violent . crime. It takes a huge amount of courage to testify against an abusive . partner or ex-partner. 'It . is crucial that victims like Loretta feel protected when they find the . strength to take their abuser to court. Violent men like Toby Hayden . must receive punishment that fits their crime. Until this happens, . domestic violence will continue to flourish in our society.' Chippenham Magistrates' Court was told . that after Hayden was shown injuries he inflicted on Miss Butterworth, . he said: 'I didn't know I was that much of an animal'. Pauline Lambert, prosecuting, said the . couple had been in a relationship for two years and started living . together in Christian Malford, Wiltshire, in October. She said Hayden began beating Miss Butterworth by pushing her against the wall and hitting her with full force on the nose. Hayden, . who pleaded guilty to three charges of assault, was banned from . contacting Miss Butterworth for two years and ordered him to pay her . £750 compensation. He was . also told to pay £250 in compensation to PC Andrew Aves from Wiltshire . Police and £100 to PC Joel Bunting, who he attacked when they arrived to . arrest him at home. After the hearing Miss Butterworth, who now lives with her mother in Corsham, . Wiltshire, criticised the sentence and described how her face 'exploded like an airbag' during the assault. She . said: 'I can't put into words what I think of him. He is scum, he has . hit a new low. I never thought he could stoop so low as to hurt someone . he loved. 'I think the case . should have gone to Crown Court because of his past. I had no idea that . magistrates are three people who aren't legally trained. 'At . least if it had gone to Crown Court he would have been before a . properly educated judge and the full story would have come out. 'I work near him and it worries me that I might bump into him. I really, really don't want to see him.' A . Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'Our radical reforms will see . everyone released from prison being supervised in the community – . including those serving sentences of less than one year.'

"Poisoned former KGB spy  Alexander Litvinenko was effectively a triple agent working for MI6 and the Spanish secret service, it was claimed yesterday. He was on the payroll of MI6 and had a handler called ‘Martin’, a barrister for his widow Marina said. The Spanish secret service was also bankrolling his espionage activities and both stipends were paid into a joint bank account he held with his wife, it was said. 'Murdered': Litvinenko was hospitalised after the radioactive substance, Polonium-210, was allegedly put in his tea. He died three days after this picture was taken on November 20, 2006 . A pre-inquest hearing yesterday was . told that the Government has ‘established’ Moscow has a case to answer . that Mr Litvinenko was assassinated in London. Mr Litvinenko was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair. As he lay dying in hospital, . ‘reluctant to tell police that he was an MI6 agent’, he handed . detectives the mobile phone number of his MI6 handler ‘Martin’, the . hearing conducted by High Court judge Sir Robert Owen was told. The death of 43-year-old Mr . Litvinenko,  a fugitive from the Putin regime, in November 2006 plunged . Anglo-Russian diplomatic relations into deep freeze. Determined: Marina Litvinenko, the widow of former spy Alexander, arrives at Camden Town Hall in London today . Former KGB agents Andrei Lugovoy and . Dmitry Kovtun, who met him at the Millennium Hotel, are prime suspects . in the murder. Both deny involvement. The Crown Prosecution Service wants to charge Lugovoy, but Russia refuses to extradite him. Mr Litvinenko’s widow believes MI6 . failed to protect her husband. Her QC, Ben Emmerson, told the hearing at . Camden Town Hall in North London: ‘Mr Litvinenko had been for a number . of years a regular and paid agent and employee of MI6 with a dedicated . handler whose pseudonym was Martin.’ He said that, at the behest of MI6, Mr . Litvinenko was also working for the Spanish security services, where . his handler was called ‘Uri’. Mr Emmerson said the inquest should . consider whether MI6 failed in its duty to protect Mr Litvinenko against . a ‘real and immediate risk to life’. He suggested there was ‘an enhanced . duty resting on the British Government to ensure his safety when tasking . him with dangerous operations involving engagement with foreign . agents’. He said Mr Litvinenko was supplying the Spanish with information on organised crime and Russian mafia activity in Spain. Mr Emmerson said: ‘It is Marina . Litvinenko’s belief that the evidence will show that her husband’s death . was a murder and that Andrei Lugovoy was the main perpetrator.’ The QC . claimed Mr Litvinenko and Lugovoy were working together and had planned . to travel to Spain to deliver information about links between the . Russian mafia, the Kremlin and the country’s President Vladimir Putin. ‘He had a separate telephone for . contacting Martin and by the time of his death he also had a separate . direct phone for contacting Lugovoy,’ he said. When Mr Litvinenko fell ill – but . before he realised he was slowly dying from polonium – he phoned Lugovoy . from his bed in University College Hospital to say that he could not . make the trip. Escape: Alexander Litvinenko and his wife Marina after fleeing to London on November 4, 2000 . In a further twist, it was claimed by a . lawyer acting for Russian dissident billionaire Boris Berezovsky that . Lugovoy was actually double-crossing his spymasters at the Kremlin. Mr . Litvinenko died three weeks after being poisoned by the radioactive . isotope. An inquiry set up after his death said . secret Government documents, which included material submitted by . Scotland Yard and intelligence agencies, showed that the Russian state . did have a case to answer. The extraordinary claims are expected to plunge relations between Britain and Russia to a new low. Hugh Davies, counsel to the inquest, . said: ‘Our assessment is that the Government material does establish a . prima facie case as to the culpability of the Russian state in the death . of Alexander Litvinenko.’ Memories: Widow Marina Litvinenko with her husband Alexander Litvinenko on their wedding day in 1994 . Mr Litvinenko, 43, was allegedly poisoned while drinking tea during a meeting with former KGB contacts at the Millennium Hotel in Grosvenor Square, pictured, in November 2006 . He added the evidence ruled out the . involvement of Chechen terrorist groups, the Spanish mafia, Russian . exile Mr Berezovsky and the British Government in his death. Mr Davies said assessments of material submitted by the Government had shown no evidence it had failed to protect him. Until now, the Russians have remained . at arm’s length but yesterday the Kremlin indicated it would like to . become an ‘interested party’ when the full inquest begins next year, . giving its own QC the chance to make submissions and cross-examine . witnesses. Mr Emmerson said the evidence amounted . to a ‘state-sponsored assassination’ by Moscow. At yesterday’s hearing, . he also cited evidence from a Wikileaks cable which quoted Mr . Litvinenko saying Putin was implicated in the nation’s mafia and that . Russia was a ‘mafia state’. Neil Garnham QC, representing the Home . Office, told the hearing he could ‘neither confirm nor deny’ whether Mr . Litvinenko was employed by British intelligence services. After the hearing, Mrs Litvinenko said . she was ‘hopeful’ the full inquest would answer her questions, . especially about Moscow’s alleged involvement. The full inquest, . beginning on May 1, will be held before Sir Robert Owen who has been . appointed assistant deputy coroner. Alexander Litvinenko fled to Britain after accusing senior officials in Moscow of ordering a number of assassinations. The former KGB officer was granted asylum with his wife and son in 2000 and allegedly started working with both MI5 and MI6, revealing secrets on the Putin regime. Mr Litvinenko, 43, is also believed to have worked with other European intelligence agencies and he wrote a series of books in which he accused the FSB – the successor to the KGB – of carrying out terror attacks and murders to help get Vladimir Putin into power. Keen for information on the Russian mafia, he met two former FSB men, Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovturn, at the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair, on November 1, 2006. Hours later, he collapsed at home and began vomiting. He was admitted to hospital three days later.Litvinenko, who lost his hair because of the radiation, released a statement blaming ‘barbaric’ Putin for involvement in his poisoning. He died on November 22. Police went to Moscow to interview Lugovoy and Kovturn, but Russia refused to extradite Lugovoy, triggering a diplomatic row in which both countries expelled diplomats.","Former KGB agent introduced to Spanish intelligence services by MI6 .

"With the 2014 Ryder Cup fast approaching, many are predicting another victory for the Europeans - favourites after winning five of the last six tournaments. But perhaps fans shouldn't be getting too comfortable. Here, Sportsmail's Mike Dickson gives five reasons the USA team shouldn't be written off. 1 Tiger factor . While he is unquestionably a great player it is doubtful whether Tiger’s presence has been a good thing for the team with his aura and the distractions he brings. Was it a coincidence that the last time the USA won was in 2008 when Woods was absent through injury? Tiger not playing possibly changes the team dynamic for the better. The absence of Tiger Woods could prove a blessing for the Americans, who have not won since 2008 . 2 Close encounters . While the Europeans have had much the better of it since 1985 the last two matches could have gone either way — both finishing 14½-13½ to Europe. At Celtic Manor in 2010 the Americans had a good run at eradicating a three-point deficit while at Medinah in 2012 the match was stolen from them by a European ‘miracle’ after they had led 10-6. 3 Men on a mission . When Tom Watson announced his captain’s picks it was notable how often the word ‘redemption’ was used. The result from Medinah has haunted the players involved and there is a real sense of them being on a mission to make amends as their ‘Team Redeem’ motto suggests. USA captain Tom Watson says they are out to avenge Medinah at this year's Ryder Cup . 4 Home comforts . The weekend weather forecast suggests that the temperatures will not be that hostile to the visitors and there are aspects of the Centenary Course, designed by Jack Nicklaus, which are not totally foreign either. It lies inland, has large man-made bunkers and plenty of water. The country-club vibe should make them feel right at home. 5 European flops . While it turns out Tom Watson has left some in-form players behind, such as Billy Horschel and Chris Kirk, not all of the European side arrive on the back of great recent results. It has been a relatively flat year for Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter while it cannot be certain how rookies Jamie Donaldson and Victor Dubuisson will react. Ian Poulter has not enjoyed the most impressive season in the run-up to the Ryder Cup . VIDEO Gleneagles Course Guides .","Five reasons USA's Ryder Cup team shouldn't be written off .

"Formula One star Michael Schumacher has been dumped by wealthy sponsors since the ski accident which left him 'paralysed' Formula One star Michael Schumacher has been dumped by wealthy sponsors since the ski accident which left him 'paralysed' and close to death. The seven-time champion is expected to lose out on more than £4million a year as a result of the decisions by companies who no longer see him as a role model for their products. Fashion firms Navyboot and Jet Set have reportedly severed all commercial ties with the recovering coma victim as doubts remain over the chances of a full recovery. Schumacher, 45, suffered severe head injuries while skiing with his family in the French Alps in December last year. He is currently recovering, but is said to be 'paralysed, wheelchair-bound and unable to speak', according to former racing driver Philippe Streiff. A spokeswoman for Phillipe Gaydoul, who owns the fashion firms, confirmed the decision to the end the lucrative contract, which paid Schumacher £4million a year. 'It is not easy for Schumacher's sponsors: paying out millions of Swiss francs per year and receiving nothing back since the crash,' said Swiss news website Bluewin . 'But must they separate in this situation from the Formula 1 legend? It is a balancing act: On the one hand, the sponsors must pursue economic objectives, which point towards for a parting. On the other hand it will not be well received in public if you are turning your back on Schumacher at this difficult time.' Earlier this year the German mineral water company Rosbacher reportedly annulled its contract with him. It is not yet clear which other companies have severed their links with Schumacher, who is being cared for by a team of specialists at his £35million mansion on the shores of Lake Geneva. Scroll down for video . Phillipe Gaydoul (left), owner of the fashion firms Navyboot and Jet Set, has publicly severed his commercial ties with the 45-year-old recovering coma victim . German mineral water company Rosbacher reportedly annulled its contract with the Formula One star . Mercedes and wealth management firm DVAG have promised to stand by the stricken star. He was transferred to his mansion at the end of the summer from a rehab clinic in Lausanne where doctors decided it would be better for him to be with his family. Last month Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm said the driver faced a 'difficult' and 'long' rehabilitation. She said it was 'not possible' to say how long it would take for him to fully recover. Schumacher, who has amassed a £500million fortune, is being cared for in a state-of-the-art medical suite built inside his mansion. The Formula One driver, who is a very competent skier, was on holiday with family and friends in French Alps ski-resort Meribel when the accident happened. He went off-piste while skiing with his 14-year-old son and struck a partially-covered rock. The contract with Navyboot and Jet Set reportedly paid Schumacher more than £4million a year . He was not skiing fast but he lost control and catapulted 34 feet on to another rock and smashed his head on a bolder. Schumacher was airlifted from the slopes minutes after the accident to Moutiers Hospital and was then transferred 80 miles west to CHU Grenoble, a larger hospital that specialises in head injuries. He arrived at 12.40pm and had been placed in an artificial coma. He was immediately operated on to relieve pressure on his brain. At the end of January it was announced that doctors had begun the process of gradually awakening him from his coma. On April 4 Kehm revealed that he was showing 'moments of consciousness and awakening'. He had opened his eyes and had interaction, albeit minimal, with his environment. It was the first piece of positive news for months. The driver  suffered brain damage after a ski accident in French-resort Meribel in December last year .

"Prosecutors in a murder case against Aaron Hernandez won't be allowed to tell a jury about two other killings with which the ex-New England Patriot is charged or the final text messages the victim sent to his sister, a judge ruled on Friday. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder in the June 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. He has also pleaded not guilty to the fatal shootings of two men in 2012 after an encounter at a Boston nightclub. Prosecutors have said Hernandez may have showed Lloyd the spot where the double shooting allegedly took place, and suggested that was a possible motive for killing Lloyd. Scroll down for video . All smiles: Aaron Hernandez, center, a former New England Patriots NFL football player, smiles at his attorney Michael Fee, left, as co-counsel Charles Rankin, right, listens during a pre-trial motion hearing . Saved by the judge: Judge Susan Garsh says prosecutors in the murder case against Hernandez may not tell jurors about two other killings with which the he is charged . Still suspicious: Aaron Hernandez, a former New England Patriots NFL football player, looks back towards the gallery during the pre-trial motion hearing in the Superior Court . 'I don't think that it's fair to say these things aren't relevant,' said Assistant District Attorney William McCauley. But Judge E. Susan Garsh, after hearing arguments, said the prosecution's theory is 'clearly in the realm of speculation' and 'does not comport with common sense.' She said there was no demonstrated link between the two crimes and disallowed the introduction of the 2012 homicides. Garsh also said on Friday she would not admit the final text messages sent by Lloyd to his sister, including one sent just minutes before he was shot to death at an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough home. Prosecutors say Lloyd sent the messages while in a car with Hernandez and suggested they showed he had become fearful. One said 'U saw who I'm with' and another indicated the person was 'NFL,' referring to Hernandez, adding 'just so u know.' McCauley suggested Hernandez stopped somewhere on the way to the spot Lloyd was killed, saying investigators found dirt in his car's tires that didn't match soil from the crime scene. The car, which had been in 'pristine shape' when Lloyd was picked up, was later found to be scratched and the side mirror missing, he said. Defense lawyers called it 'rank speculation' that the texts indicated fear and said they were inadmissible. Garsh said the texts did not suggest any hostility and that prosecutors didn't meet the burden to prove Lloyd felt he was at an 'imminent death.' Spared: Judge Susan Garsh says prosecutors in the murder case against Hernandez may not tell jurors about two other killings with which the he is charged . Jury selection is scheduled to start Jan. 9. Patriots coach Bill Belichick and team owner Robert Kraft have been listed by prosecutors as possible witnesses. Garsh also ruled that prosecutors may not introduce the shooting of Alexander Bradley, a former associate of Hernandez. Bradley has filed a civil suit against Hernandez that says the ex-player shot him in the face in 2013 after an argument in Florida. Massachusetts prosecutors sought to admit a range of evidence related to the ex-player's other alleged crimes or 'bad acts,'  including the Boston homicides, firearms found at Hernandez's home or elsewhere and even a photograph obtained from the celebrity gossip website TMZ that depicts Hernandez holding a gun. His attorneys warned against compromising his right to a fair trial. 'It is critical that this trial be about the murder of Odin Lloyd,'; defense attorney James Sultan said Friday. The judge allowed in some evidence relating to firearms, but disallowed the photograph.

"The early 1900s were a time of nobility and an idyllic, non-commercial European way of life - before it was interrupted by the ravages of war. Seized by the Nazis more than 70 years ago, these beautifully rendered travel posters have stood the test of time, depicting locations the way the artists intended them to be seen. For those who fancy the chance to take home a piece of history, Swann Auction Galleries is offering the opportunity to own part of the Julius Paul Collection. One of the priciest of the bunch, Henri Cassiers's advert for Red Star Line is expected to fetch up to £4,800 at an auction in New York .

Pictured: Emil Cardinaux's Bern . The majority of these posters, restituted to Mr Paul’s heirs in 2008, were created before the First World War. Free from marketing gimmicks or stylised shoots, these adverts are reminiscent of a time when a landscape drawing was enough to encourage people to buy a ticket for a train or ocean liner. The international collection features holiday destinations from Austria and Yugoslavia to the US and Canada, as well as vintage images of the most extravagant ocean liners and top ski resorts of the era.

"Amanda Knox has gone from being the subject of intense media frenzy to a member of the Fourth Estate. Nine months after an Italian court convicted Ms Knox in absentia for the second time of murdering her roommate, the 27-year-old was hired as a freelance writer at weekly West Seattle Herald. Knox, who traveled to Perugia, Italy, back in 2007 to study creative writing, has now come a full circle. Cub reporter: Amanda Knox's byline appears on her latest article that appeared October 29 in the West Seattle Herald, where she has been working as a contributor for several months now . Good intentions: Robinson said that the paper wanted to give Knox (pictured in January 2014), who grew up in West Seattle, a chance to 'be an actual human being' According to her editor Patrick Robinson, Amanda has been quietly writing human interest stories and covering the local theater scene for several months now. 'We approached her originally to give her the opportunity of a normal life,' Robinson told The Daily Beast. 'We simply asked her as we would ask anyone of that age and stage, if they would be interested in writing for us as a qualified writer of that scale and this level of journalism.' At first, the rookie reporter asked to write under a nom de plume to protect her privacy in light of her notoriety. Guilty: Knox (left) was convicted for the first time in 2009 of murdering her roommate Meredith Kercher in Perugia, Italy . Co-conspirator: Knox's then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito was also found guilty of Kercher's slaying . Robinson told the paper that after submitting her first few writing samples and getting her bearings, Knox started churning out articles under her real byline. So far, Italy’s infamous convicted murderer has written about 10 stories, including a review of a high school production of Tom Stoppard’s play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. 'Amanda’s a very bright, very capable, highly qualified writer,' Robinson said. 'She’s certainly been through as lot and been very easy to work with and very interested and eager in doing stories.' Robinson said that the paper wanted to give Knox, who grew up in West Seattle, a chance to 'be an actual human being versus a celebrity.' The editor noted that the newspaper is not concerned with the Italian justice system's ongoing campaign to have Knox extradited. Amanda Knox's murder case has been making headlines around the world for the past seven years. In November 2007, Meredith Kercher, Amanda's college roommate in Perugia, was discovered with her throat slit. Knox and her then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were charged with killing the British national and convicted of the crime in 2009, despite widespread accusations that the case was badly mishandled by the prosecution. Two years later, the lovers were cleared of the charges on appeal, allowing Knox to return home to Seattle after spending four years in an Italian jail. In January 2014, Amanda's acquittal was overturned, and an Italian court once again found her guilty and re-sentenced her to 28 years in prison. Freed: Knox (center), pictured here in 2010, had her conviction overturned on appeal and returned back to Seattle . So far, Knox has not been extradited by the US Department of Justice. Italy's highest court is expected to review the case next year. Since her dramatic return to the US, Knox has been keeping busy: she re-enrolled in University of Washington to complete her degree in creative writing and penned a memoir, which came out last year. Her legal saga has inspired two movies, including a Lifetime film starring Hayden Panettiere and director Michael Winterbottom’s new feature, The Face of an Angel, with supermodel Cara Delevigne. Amanda Knox's latest article appeared in the West Seattle Herald on October 29. The rookie reporter wrote about a Kickstarter campaign to fund a local couple's organic cashew milk business. Keeping busy: Since returning to the US, Knox returned to college and published a memoir last year . Patrick Robinson, Amanda's new editor, praised her as a talented writer and a passionate contributor who is most interested in theater. He told Aol.com that the 27-year-old freelancer works mostly from home, and that he has never met her in person. So far, Knox's tenure at the paper has been successful. The editor said he has been getting positive feedback about her pieces.","Knox, 27, has been writing for West Seattle Weekly for a few months .

"A federal grand jury has added drug charges to the state rape charges facing former New Orleans Saints safety Darren Sharper. The U.S. Attorney's Office in New Orleans announced Friday that Sharper now faces charges that he and a co-defendant — Brandon Licciardi — distributed three illegal drugs 'with intent to commit rape.' The federal charges were announced hours after a New Orleans grand jury indicted Sharper, Licciardi and a third man on rape charges. Scroll down for video . Big trouble: Former NFL safety Darren Sharper has now been indicted on multiple rape allegations in New Orleans, adding to a list of charges and allegations the ex-player faces in several states . Sharper, 39, is already in jail in California on charges that he drugged and raped two women there. He also faces sexual assault charges in Arizona. In that case, he was indicted by an Arizona grand jury in March on charges he drugged and sexually assaulted two women and drugged a third. Similar accusations against Sharper in Las Vegas remain under investigation. He was previously released on $1 million bail in the California case but turned himself in on February 27 after an arrest warrant was issued in New Orleans for which he has now been charged. Sharper is also under investigation in Florida and Nevada and authorities suspect he may have raped nine women in total. A Los Angeles County investigator described a pattern in which the former football star met women at clubs or parties and lured them to a hotel room, where they were allegedly drugged and raped. Under lock and key: Former NFL player Darren Sharper is already in jail in L.A. and being held without bail as he awaits trial for multiple rape charges across a number of states . The New Orleans warrant says police learned from witnesses that Sharper and an associate had acknowledged having non-consensual sex with two women. Sharper's attorneys say he never made such statements. The warrant does not elaborate on how the information was obtained or disclose the names of the witnesses. Disturbing details from other police reports also made public paint the picture of a possible serial rapist with a similar series of events in all incidents. The former all-pro would meet women in a nightclub and invite them back to a hotel room or his apartment to party, said police. He would then offer them shots spiked with drugs and sexually assault his victims after they passed out, officials said. Multiple complaints said Sharper used morphine and zolpidem, which is sold under the brand name Ambien, to sedate his prey. The women then woke up and came to the realization they had been sexually assaulted, according to court documents. Glory days: Sharper spent most of his careers playing for the Green Bay Packers but was on the Saints team when they won the Super Bowl in the 2009 season . Sharper won a Super Bowl with the New Orleans Saints in 2010 but retired later that year after 14 NFL seasons that also included stints with Green Bay and Minnesota. He was sacked in February from his job with the NFL Network. Two other men, both acquaintances of Sharper and one of them a sheriff's deputy, were also charged as part of the nine-count grand jury indictment. Federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment charging Sharper and former sheriff's deputy Brandon Licciardi on counts of distributing controlled substances with the intent to commit a crime of violence, witness tampering and impeding a federal investigation. All three face life sentences stemming from multiple rape allegations against them.","Darren Sharper is already in jail in L.A. after being indicted in Arizona on charges of drugging and sexually assaulting two women .

"Lewis Hamilton has hailed the past two years as the best of his life after concluding two days of celebrations with everyone at Mercedes following their success in winning the Formula One constructors' title. The team, primarily based in Brackley, with the power-unit department 28 miles away in Brixworth, has been savouring the fruits of five years of hard work since Mercedes bought out Brawn GP at the end of 2009. The team's ninth one-two of the season in Russia on Sunday - one shy of McLaren's 1988 record - and spearheaded by Hamilton's ninth win this campaign, ensured Mercedes became champions in style for the first time in F1 history. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis and Nico celebrate constructor's title with  team . Lewis Hamilton poses for a selfie in front of the Mercedes staff as they celebrated the title in Brackley . Nico Rosberg and Hamilton have both produced great form in order to produce nine one-two finishes . Mercedes celebrate the title win at the Russian Grand Prix on Sunday with Hamilton coming out on top . Hamilton, who opted to end his long association with McLaren and join Mercedes at the start of 2013, was initially left speechless as he addressed the workforce. The 29-year-old then said: 'What an incredible feeling it is to be stood in front of all these incredible people. 'You almost have to take a step back and just think about what we've achieved together. 'I know it's been a long road and many of the team have had to work through tough times to lay the foundations for what we're seeing today, and I'm incredibly grateful for all of their hard work. 'These past two years have been the best of my life - and that's all down to everybody standing here. 'The effort and the synergy here is unlike anything I've ever seen and I'm excited for the future.' The Briton will now try to secure the individual title ahead of team-mate Rosberg - he is currently 17 points up . Rosberg, co-team boss Paddy Lowe, Hamilton and Williams' Valtteri Bottas wave from the podium in Sochi . The short-term aim, though, is now the drivers' crown, with Hamilton 17 points clear of Rosberg following a dramatic turnaround in results over the past four races. At least the party atmosphere diverted the attentions of both drivers from their primary goal for a short period. Rosberg, who has been with Mercedes since they first returned to the sport in 2010, said: ""So this is it - we're actually standing here now as world champions! 'This has been a long time coming. Since I joined at the start of this project I expected this day to come as I've had such strong belief in this group of people from right back on day one. 'To be a part of that and to have finally achieved this championship in such dominant fashion is a great feeling. The entire Mercedes team was delighted as they finally wrapped up the constructors' title in Sochi . Hamilton says he is enjoying the best years of his life as part of the Mercedes team he joined two years ago . 'I'd like to say a big thank you to everyone for all their hard work. 'I hope they can really enjoy this moment, that there will be many more great moments to come and that this is just the beginning of a long era of success for the Silver Arrows.' Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff rightly acknowledged the work done by Ross Brawn as it was he who set the ball rolling. Following their double triumph in 2009, it was Brawn's team Mercedes bought out, and then it was he who led a recruitment drive to ensure the marque had the right personnel in place to become champions. Brawn, though, was forced out at the end of last year, but in paying tribute, Wolff said: 'Winning the first constructors' championship for Mercedes-Benz is a moment of immense pride for all of us. Hamilton lifts the trophy on the podium after winning in Sochi - there are just three races left of the season . The start-to-finish win for Hamilton in Sochi was impressive - and pushed him further ahead of Rosberg . 'This is the moment to recognise everybody involved in that team effort - starting with Ross Brawn, who was an inspiring figure at the team and laid the foundations for our current success. 'I thank each and every one of these great people for their involvement in what we have achieved and raise a toast to their efforts - the best of the best.' Non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, meanwhile, knows the real hard work has only just started as the team set their sights on repeating such success again and again. 'We have three more races and we must keep on pushing to make sure our drivers have an equal chance to win their title,' said Lauda. 'Then we must push even harder to keep winning year after year - and it will only get tougher, but I believe we have the people to do that.'

"An unopened bottle of wine made on the orders of Adolf Hitler to celebrate his 54th birthday has gone up for sale. The rare 1.5-litre bottle was among a batch made on Hitler's orders to mark his birthday on April 20, 1943, which he then gifted to high-ranking German officers. The wartime dictator called the red wine 'Fuhrerwein' - meaning 'leader's wine' - and insisted the bottle's label carried a picture of himself in uniform. A rare unopened 1.5-litre bottle of wine made to celebrate Hitler's birthday in 1943 has surfaced and will now go on sale . A wax label on the bottle carries an image of an eagle on top of a swastika and a stamp of the Reichszeugmeisterei, the central office that supplied Nazi equipment. The wine itself is 12 per cent Schwarzer Tafelwein - 'black table wine' - thought to have been made in Germany but, despite a wax seal on the bottle, experts say it would now be undrinkable. Hitler wouldn't have enjoyed the wine himself however, because he was famously teetotal. The bottle was given to a Hungarian prisoner of war by a German soldier after the war and has remained in the same family ever since. Hitler famously did not drink alcohol but gave the wine to his top military officers . The bottle contains a stamp of the Reichszeugmeisterei, the central office that supplied Nazi equipment, . and the wine is described as Schwarzer Tafelwein, meaning 'black table wine' Hitler had little to celebrate in 1943, as Allied forces turned the tables on the Nazis in Europe and on the Eastern Front. In . April 1945, just days after his 56th birthday, Hitler shot himself in . his underground bunker at the Reich Chancery in Berlin as Soviet forces . advanced. The bottle has a wax seal and a label carrying an image of an eagle on top of a swastika . The wine, which has been verified by historians, has emerged just days before the 125th anniversary of Hitler's birth in Austria. It is expected to fetch £2,000 when it is sold following an online auction ending on April 21. Dominic Hughes, from McTear's Auctioneers in Glasgow, said: 'The bottle was consigned to us by a Hungarian man whose father had procured it during World War II. 'The owner's father was taken as a prisoner of war and when he returned home he was given this bottle by a German soldier. It has been in his family ever since. 'Hitler commissioned the red wine to be made for his 54th birthday to give as presents to his general staff. 'He was so self obsessed that he called the wine Fuhrerwein and insisted the label carried a picture of himself on it. 'The . wine was possibly produced in Germany and would not have been amazing . when it was bottled, but now it would be completely undrinkable. 'Two years after it was made Hitler was dead and the war was all but over. The bottle is a 1.5-litre magnum which is very rare. 'I . think that the bottle is an important historical artifact - it is . certainly not a bottle that you would come across very often, if at . all.' A German gun which was adapted by British secret services for an audacious plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler is now on display in Essex. The Luger pistol - specially adapted with a British-made silencer - had been set to be used during the Second World War in a bid to kill the Nazi leader at his holiday home in Bavaria. The plan was eventually ditched in late 1944 after British intelligence disagreed over whether killing the Nazi leader at that point in the war was a sensible strategy. The specially-silenced Lugar was to be used by a sniper who was going to be dropped behind enemy lines . The pistol is now proudly on display as part of the Donnington Collection at the Combined Military Services Museum in Maldon, Essex. Clive McPherson, historian at the museum, said: 'I think this is a really interesting sideline to history. It's interesting to think what would be different if they had gone ahead with the plan.' The assassination attempt - code named 'Operation Foxley' - was put together after a captured German guard revealed Hitler enjoyed a morning walk every day whilst staying at his holiday hideout in the Bavarian Alps. Hitler would wander unguarded for around 20 minutes from the Berghoff to a local teahouse at around 10am each morning. Historian Clive McPherson believes the plan never went ahead because Hitler was making so many mistakes at the time, it was better not to kill him . An English sniper and a Polish soldier, who spoke fluent German, were set to be disguised as German mountain troops and parachuted in close to Hitler's residence in Berchtesgaden, Germany, to shoot him as he went for his morning walk. The sniper was equipped with a Mauser for the sniper shot as well as the specially-silenced Luger pistols to kill anybody who uncovered the plot. The plan had been set to go ahead around the time of the Normandy landings in June 1944 but was eventually scrapped. It is believed intelligence chiefs in Britain disagreed over whether killing Hitler was a good idea, with some claiming he was a bad strategist and feared he might be replaced by a better leader, and others believing he could become a martyr to Nazi forces, who would become more difficult to defeat. The firearm has now gone on display in the Donnington Collection at the Combined Military Services Museum in Maldon, Essex . Other secret murder plots considered included bombing Hitler's personal train or poisoning the water supply. The Donnington Collection is a unique collection of weapons used and captured by the British Army during the 19th and 20th centuries, assembled by MOD Donnington. Mr McPherson added: 'These pistols were German but were caught from the enemy during the war. 'Only 10 of the Luger pistols were ever specially adapted by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) for the mission and we have three on display here. 'German's did not use silenced weapons so British-made silencers were added to the pistols.' There are thought to have been more than 25 attempts to kill Hitler between his rise to power in the 1930s and his death in 1945. The most famous is the so-called 'July 20 Plot', when senior officer, Colonel Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg (pictured right), planted a bomb at the leader's Wolf's Lair headquarters. The plot was planned to coincide with a seizure of power in Berlin, but failed when Hitler was only concussed and burned in the blast and the military coup failed. The botched plan lead to the arrest of around 7,000 people believed to have been involved and the execution of around 5,000. Colonel von Stauffenberg was played by Tom Cruise in a 2008 film adaption of the episode, called Valkyrie. In an earlier attempt on Hitler's life, the Oster Conspiracy of 1938, another group of high-ranking German officials planned to storm the Reichkanzlei building. But the plan relied on strong British opposition to Hitler's seizure of the Sudetenland and after then-Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain signed a peace deal with Hitler the plan fell away. In a later assasination bid, a Major General Henning von Tresckow attempted to kill Hitler as he flew back from field headquarters near Vinnitsa in Ukraine, on 19 February 1943. He handed a bomb, disguised as a box containing two bottles of cognac, for a friend in Germany. But the device failed to go off because it was placed in the cargo hold of Hitler's plane, where it is believed to have been too cold for the detonator to work.","Wine made in 1943 given to Hungarian prisoner by German soldier after war .

"A New York police union has told Bill de Blasio to stay away from funerals of cops killed in the line of duty. The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association posted a form on its website that members could download and sign, barring the mayor and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito from their service. It simply reads: 'As a New York City police officer, (I) request that Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito refrain from attending my funeral services.' Scroll down for video . The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association posted a form on its website that members could download and sign, barring Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito from their service . The letter then goes on to state that their 'consistent refusal to show police officers the support and respect they deserve' would mean their attendance is an 'insult'. The mayor and the speaker released a joint statement condemning the move. According to the Daily News, the pair said: This is deeply disappointing. Incendiary rhetoric like this serves only to divide the city, and New Yorkers reject these tactics. 'The mayor and the speaker both know better than to think this inappropriate stunt represents the views of the majority of police officers and their families.' PBA head Pat Lynch offered no comment Friday after the letter appeared. 'I don’t think that’s right' one officer told the Daily News. 'They shouldn’t be doing that ... Politics is politics, but that sounds a little personal. Last week, following days of protests in New York as a result of the grand jury decisions not to indict cops involved in the killing of Mike Brown or Eric Garner, the mayor caused anger among officers  when he said his son, Dante, should be wary when dealing with the police . He added: 'It's different for a white child, it's just a reality in this country.' During an interview with ABC he said that the United States was confronting 'centuries of racism'. The downloadable form on their website states that the pair's  'consistent refusal to show police officers the support and respect they deserve' would mean their attendance is an 'insult' The letter would then be sent to the organization who would make the arrangements . He added: 'We have to have an honest conversation in this country about a history of racism, we have to have an honest conversation about the problems that have caused parents to feel that their children may be in danger in their dynamics with police, when in fact police are there to protect them. 'Our police keep us safe, and yet there's been not just decades of problems, a history of centuries of racism that undergird this reality.' De Blasio, who is white and married to a black woman with whom he has mixed-race children, added: 'We have to retrain police forces in how to work with communities differently, we have to work on things like body cameras that will provide a different level of transparency and accountability. 'This is something systemic and we bluntly have to talk about the historical racial dynamics underlying (it).' Pat Lynch (center), the head of the PBA, did not comment on the letter that emerged on Friday. Many were torn was to what they thought of the move . Speaking from personal experience, de Blasio told ABC that he feared for his son's safety in dealing with the police. 'What parents have done for decades with children of color, especially young men of color, is train them to be very careful, when they have a connection with a police officer, when they have an encounter with a police officer,' he said. 'It's different for a white child, it's just a reality in this country. 'And with Dante, very early on, my son, we used to say, look, if a police officer stops you, do everything he tells you to do, don't move suddenly, don't reach for your cellphone, because we knew, sadly, there is a greater chance it might be misinterpreted if it was a young man of color.' He continued: 'There's that fear that there could be that moment of misunderstanding with a young man of color, and that young man may never come back.'","The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association posted a form on its website .

"London has been revealed as one of the world’s most expensive destinations to celebrate New Year’s Eve. Research conducted by foreign exchange firm Travelex showed that 24 per cent of Britons prefer to celebrate abroad in cities such as Prague and Budapest where the cost of alcohol and food is cheaper. Traditionally one of the most lavish nights of the year, the survey showed that Londoners and visitors spend £336.14 per person in the capital on December 31 based on the average cost of a pint of beer, a bottle of champagne, an evening meal and admission to fireworks displays. However, the same night out in New York was said to be £118.60, while in Budapest it was even cheaper, costing £66.81 – with the price of a meal for two as little as £22. The cheapest destination out of those survey was found to be Prague, where dinner and drinks were shown to cost an average of just £42.90. Of each of the six destinations surveyed, chosen because they are within a six-hour flight of London, the UK capital was the only city that is charging to see fireworks. London Mayor Boris Johnson recently confirmed the famous Thames fireworks will have an entry fee of £10 for the first time ever.

"Gwyn Roberts, 45, drank one-and-a-half litres of cider and two cans of Special Brew after a visit to his sick mother in Gwynedd ended in a row . A family doctor and father-of-three was jailed today for seriously injuring two people while over the drink-drive limit. Gwyn Haydn Roberts, 45, from Abergavenny, drank one-and-a-half litres of cider and two cans of Special Brew after a visit to his sick mother in Gwynedd ended in a row. Mold Crown Court heard he drove on the wrong side of the road and went around bends on a grass verge on the A487. The doctor cried in the dock as he admitted causing serious injuries by dangerous driving. He was banned from driving for four years. The court heard how Roberts paid a visit to his sick mother in Criccieth on June 17, which ended in a row. Roberts - who was previously disqualified from driving for 27 months in 2010 for drink driving – drove on the wrong side of the road as he motored along the A487. The journey home was a 120-mile trip that would have taken an able driver around three hours. The crash happened between Penrhyndeudraeth and Maentwrog in Gwynedd when Roberts crossed a double white line and hit a car driven by Indian restaurant workers Babel Mia and passenger Raj Mia. Both cars were written off in the collision and Babel Mia suffered a broken right foot, deep cuts to the head and knees. He was in hospital two days. His colleague suffered broken ribs, cuts and bruises. Roberts, a father of three, suffered a fractured sternum. Blood tests taken from Roberts four hours later showed he had 180 miligrammes of alcohol in his blood compared to the legal limit of 80. The crash happened between Penrhyndeudraeth and Maentwrog in Gwynedd (pictured) Father-of-three Roberts - who was previously disqualified from driving for 27 months in 2010 for drink driving – drove on the wrong side of the road as he motored along the A487 between in Gwynedd, north-west Wales . Anna Pope, defending, said Roberts was receiving treatment for his alcohol addicition and Wynford Ellis Owen had written the report on his treatment. He had gone to Criccieth to visit his ageing mother who was seriously ill with bowel cancer. But there were emotional and mental issues from his childhood which came to the surface and they triggered his decision to drive home. Miss Pope said: 'He takes responsibility for what he did and made frank admissions. 'It is clear from the references there is another side to this man. He is an extremely successful GP valued by his patients. 'He is a loving husband and father to three children. He is also an extremely troubled man throughout his adult life,' she said. The issues from his childhood had driven him to drink and prescription drugs, although there was no suggestion that had affected his work. Miss Pope said his first drink drive offence happened when he had driven to the Black Mountains to commit suicide but could not go through with it. He was arrested as he drove back and was found to be over the limit. He had been detained for a short while under the Mental Health Act and had referred himself for residential rehabilitation. He was attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and Miss Pope said he should be spared jail to allow his rehabilitation to continue. The journey the doctor wanted to take was a 120-mile trip that would have taken around three hours . But Judge Rhys Rowlands said the decision to try and drive 130 miles plus along 'tortuous roads' was 'extraordinarily dangerous'. He pointed out that he must have known full-well what he was doing was illegal. 'You were placing other road users at risk and sadly that is what happened. You were driving at speed, on the wrong side of the road and around bends, prompting one motorist to film it and another motorist described your overtaking as the most dangerous she had seen. You could easily have killed those in the other car. 'I have read letters from professional colleagues and patients you have assisted over the years. Professionally you are highly thought of and you have taken steps to try and address your drinking. You are the sole provider for a young family and the effect has been profound on them.' He sentenced Roberts to 27 months in jail and disqualified him from driving for four years. The General Medical Council will consider the future of Dr Gwyn Haydn Roberts in January, but Mold Crown Court was told he was unlikely to practise medicine again.","Gwyn Roberts, 45, sentenced to 27 months in jail at Mold Crown Court .

"Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal has dropped his supplier of foie gras after embarrassing footage of ducks being force-fed was released on the internet. The owner of the Michelin-starred Fat Duck restaurant in Bray, Berkshire dropped his French foie gras supplier due to animal rights concerns. A spokesman for the Fat Duck said: 'We were shocked at the video and the conditions in which the ducks were apparently being kept.' The restaurant said the farm had shown the highest levels of animal husbandry when they inspected it. Heston Blumenthal, pictured, has dropped his French supplier of foie gras after a video was released . Foie gras is produced by force-feeding ducks or geese so their tasty livers expand by ten times the size . The Daily Mirror  released footage of injured ducks in the Maison Miteault farm being force-fed. At least one of the ducks in the video appears to have died. Farm owner Louis-Marie Mitteault said he was unsure whether the footage was shot in his farm claiming that people were welcome to inspect his facility at any time. Each year approximately 38 million ducks and geese are killed in France to make foie gras. The birds are routinely force-fed before being hung upside down and having their throats slit. Farmers only use male birds and the females are tossed into an electric mincer at one day old. Meanwhile, Blumenthal's Michelin star restaurant, The Fat Duck is moving to Melbourne for six months in the new year. The restaurant is heading south while the building is being refurbished. Billed by the restaurateur as 'the furthest migration of a duck', Blumenthal said his award-winning venue would move to Australia next year, opening in Melbourne in February. Force-feeding ducks and geese is banned in the UK so restaurants have to import the delicacy from France . He said The Fat Duck would temporarily close its UK premises, in Bray, Berkshire - with staff and some of the furniture at the three-Michelin-starred restaurant moving around the world for six months. Speaking at a press conference, Blumenthal said: 'I'm going to shut The Fat Duck and bring it here to Melbourne. 'This is probably the furthest migration a duck - of any kind, let along a big fat duck - has made.' Blumenthal said the Australian venture would close after six months and he would return to the UK, with a new restaurant - Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. He said: 'This is not a pop-up restaurant, this is not a guest chef coming over and doing a few weeks or a period of time in somebody else's restaurant. 'We are going to pick up The Fat Duck, the whole team, and fly them over here. 'We're even going to pick up some of the bits of the restaurant - maybe the sign, maybe bits of the leather from the chairs - and incorporate it into the dining space in The Fat Duck. 'Then in January we are all going to come over here. The plan is to open here in February.' Flying away: He would temporarily close its UK premises, in Bray, Berkshire - with staff and some of the furniture at the three-Michelin-starred restaurant moving around the world for six months . Opened to critical acclaim in 2011, the restaurant specialises in historical English food and caters for about 1,000 customers a week. A meal for two can cost around £190, and signature dishes include the Meat Fruit recipe - a chicken liver mousse made to look like a mandarin orange. Blumenthal shut The Fat Duck for two weeks in 2009 following an outbreak of the winter bug that left more than 500 people feeling sick.","Heston Blumenthal has dropped his foie gras supplier over welfare fears .

"A driver sent a ticket for speeding past a primary school has successfully had his case dismissed after arguing the white lines marked either side were too short. David Erasmus, 55, opted to have his day in court after being snapped allegedly doing 36mph in a 30mph zone. After receiving the ticket, the former engineer had revisited the spot where he was caught and noticed that the white road markings, used to measure the speed that a vehicle is travelling between them, seemed short. David Erasmus (pictured) opted to have his day in court after being snapped allegedly doing 36mph in a 30mph zone in Hendy, west Wales . Adamant he had not been speeding, he measured the markings and found they were three inches shorter than at other speed camera locations. During his trial, Mr Erasmus, of Hendy, near Llanelli, west Wales, was able to convice Llanelli Magistrates Court that the shorter lines made it appear he was going faster than he actually was. His case has now been formally dismissed. During his trial, he argued the white lines used to measure speed (pictured) were three inches out, meaning he appeared on the speed camera to be going faster than he actually was . Mr Erasmus has now had his case formally dismissed at Llanelli Magistrates Court and said the ruling was likely to impact other drivers . The decision could mean hundreds of other drivers have been wrongly convicted of speeding - some may even have been banned. 'The lines were three inches short, which is a big difference. It will impact on other drivers,' he said after the trial. 'It was worth challenging it as I got it to court and the case was dismissed.' A spokesman for GoSafe, which is responsible for speed camera enforcement in Wales, said it would look closely at the evidence in the case. 'The camera and secondary check marks on the A4138 has been fully type approved by the Home Office and the secondary check marks in particular, meet the required tolerance. 'The outcome of the case is a matter for the Magistrates Courts, however, we are keen to understand the circumstances and will review the case in due course.' Carmarthenshire Council transport manager John McEvoy said: 'The markings referred to will be measured by our team this week to confirm the interval measurements reported to the court and, if necessary, amended.'

"A baby's first smile, their first Christmas, those unsteady first steps... these are precious moments every new parent cherishes. But one couple missed nine months of their baby daughter's life after officials wrongly took her away – and initially offered them just £500 in compensation. Their child was even put up for permanent adoption before the case was thrown out by a judge, who described it as a 'debacle'. Cheryll Rich and Jack Barnes have now been reunited with their daughter Misty (pictured) who was put up for permanent adoption in the 'debacle' Cheryll Rich and Jack Barnes, who have now been reunited with their daughter Misty, told the Mail of their disgust last night at the 'insulting' compensation offer. Miss Rich said: 'Those are months we will never get back. We read the log from when Misty was with the foster carer. When she rolled over for the first time. Her first teddy. Pictures from her first Christmas. 'She was toddling when we got her back. We had missed her first step. I'll never know if she called the foster carer mama before me.' Misty was born in November 2012 and is the first child of 27-year-old Miss Rich, a retail assistant, and Mr Barnes, 40, a scaffolder, who have been together for nine years. Miss Rich was attacked near her home in Grays, Essex, when she was six months pregnant, but fortunately her baby was not harmed.But in a seemingly heavy-handed decision after Misty's birth, social workers would not let the couple take her home in case they were targeted again and said she would be taken away if they did not find somewhere else to live. Thurrock Council, which oversaw the case, initially offered just £500 in compensation, which they later upped to £5,000 . But the couple, who missed their daughter's first steps, said they saw the offer as an 'insult' and have refused to accept it . Miss Rich and Mr Barnes struggled to find somewhere and over the following weeks, the council placed them in a refuge and B&Bs across the country. 'All we wanted to do was take her home,' Miss Rich said. 'It was ridiculous but at every stage we were told: 'Do this or we'll take her away'.' A month later, the couple were taken to court with just one day's notice, where they were told Misty would be taken into temporary care because of their chaotic lifestyle – which they say was caused entirely by social workers. The heartbroken parents fought through the courts to get her back, but social workers placed adverts for Misty to be adopted permanently. In a disorderly case overseen at times by a student social worker, the couple was  twice sent private details about other children in care by accident – a serious breach of data protection. Their case was finally heard by judge Mrs Justice Jennifer Roberts, who said social services had 'completely mishandled the situation'. Describing the couple as 'loving parents', she reunited them with their daughter and – after a year of check-ups from social workers – they were told after Misty's second birthday last month that the case has finally been closed. Thurrock Council, which oversaw the case, apologised in private but refused to do so publicly. They later raised the compensation offer to £5,000 but the couple saw it as an 'insult' and refused it. Thurrock MP Jackie Doyle-Price said: 'Nothing can replace the time they have lost. A major injustice has taken place here.' A council spokesman said: 'The safety of the child is always of paramount importance.'","Cheryll Rich and Jack Barnes have now been reunited with  daughter Misty .

"The Spielberg classic Jaws has heavily influenced Western Australia's strategy on how to deal with sharks, according to latest research.

Doctor Christopher Neff, of the University of Sydney, said: 'In particular, the Western Australian Government's current 'Imminent Threat' policy to catch and kill 'rogue' sharks is predicated on Hollywood fiction. 'This policy is using myths as the basis for killing sharks that are protected by law and which provides no real beach safety. 'This fiction serves an important political purpose because films allow politicians to rely on familiar narratives following shark bites to blame individual sharks in order to make the events governable and to trump evidence-based science. 'The message from this research is that politicians do not have a right to their own set of scientific facts about sharks, no matter how popular the movie.

'Unpacking the politics of shark bites, or any public policy issue, involves addressing the way words and images are used to paint a picture for the public and inform policy choices.

Obama's Democratic Party. A revolt over financial provisions by House Democratic . leader Nancy Pelosi, long a staunch Obama ally, led to a day of . tension on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Democrats, aware of the need for unity when Republicans take . full control of Congress next year after their midterm election . gains, tried to tamp down speculation of a lasting split between . Obama and Pelosi. One leadership aide said Pelosi had fired a . warning shot to Republicans that House Democrats would fight . hard in the new year. Reid opened Friday's debate on the bill urging quick . passage. 'Since 2011 we have lurched from crisis to crisis with . the country constantly under the threat of shutdown or financial . catastrophe,' he said. McConnell was also anxious to avoid another unpopular . government shutdown as the Republicans head toward taking . control of the Senate after the November elections that also . gave them a larger House majority. In the 219-206 House vote, 67 Republicans rejected the . spending bill, largely because it failed to take action to stop . Obama's immigration order. But that was offset by 57 Democrats . who voted in favor. The spending bill would fund all government agencies through . September 2015, except for the Department of Homeland Security, . which would get an extension only through Feb. 27. That is the . department mainly in charge of implementing the order announced . by Obama last month.","Senators need to pass a bill to dodge a federal government shutdown .

"These are the stunning views from atop Britain – but you’ll need to be an expert climber with a head for heights and an appetite for danger to reach the country’s tallest peak in winter. A group of brave mountain climbers captured these incredible images as they conquered the treacherous ice-covered rock face using ropes, spikes and crampons. Their photos reveal the breath-taking beauty of the landscape surrounding the snow-capped peak of 4,400ft Ben Nevis in the western end of Scotland’s Grampian Mountains. Daniel Wildey captured this amazing image during a dangerous climb to the top of Ben Nevis, Britain's tallest peak . To get there, the climbers had to trek through the Minus Three Gully, which is tricky as the steep, narrow path is only accessible for the most experienced of climbers. It is a challenging climb in fair weather but it becomes treacherous and fraught with danger when it is covered in snow and whipped by the frigid wind. Daniel Wildey, an adventure and travel photographer and writer, took the photos as experienced climbers Tommy Kelly and Mike Pescod scaled the peak. It was Mr Wildey's first climb in Scotland and he says the scariest part was the 'sense of remoteness and isolation' in the Highlands . Daniel said: ‘Winter climbing has inherent objective dangers such as weather and conditions. ‘The climb itself is three to four pitches long and took maybe two hours, including lots of stopping for photographs. ‘Winter climbing requires specialist equipment - the obvious being crampons, stiff boots and technical ice axes. ‘Standard climbing gear is also needed, like ropes and harnesses, but another specialist piece is a rack of ice screws for protection.' It took the group - Daniel Wildey, Tommy Kelly and Mike Pescod - around two hours to reach the peak of the mountain in Scotland . He added: ‘The clothing required to stay active and safe in Scottish winter condition is also very specialised. ‘I honestly don't remember what it was like reaching the top as I was so focused on shooting the photos. ‘All I know is the job wasn't finished until we were safely down.’ This was Daniel’s first climb in Scotland. The brave climbers conquered the treacherous ice-covered rock face using ropes, spikes and crampons . The 36-year-old, from Cumbria, said: ‘I've done a fair bit of mountaineering and ice climbing in the Alps and other mountain ranges but this was my first taste of Scottish winter. ‘I felt perfectly safe being with two highly experienced mountain professionals, but the scariest part was the surprising sense of remoteness and isolation you feel in the Highlands. ‘The picture of Tommy in the green jacket climbing out of the cave is the stand out feature of the climb. ‘The shot doesn't do justice to the difficulty of committing your swing out on to the face. ‘However, I think it does capture the feeling of trepidation whilst waiting for your turn.’","Travel photographer Daniel Wildey captured the images while climbing Ben Nevis in Scotland .

"A former Christian radio host was called a 'wolf in sheep's clothing' on Thursday as he was sentenced to 40 years for raping an 11-year-old boy. John Balyo, 36, of Caledonia, Michigan, was arrested in a June as part of a sex trafficking ring bust, and in September, pleaded guilty to sexually abusing the child in a hotel room. At the sentencing hearing, Judge Robert Holmes Bell said it was difficult to reconcile Balyo's public image as a newlywed expectant father, who was a camp counselor and missionary volunteer, with that of the sadistic pedophile which came to light in the police investigation. Police found Balyo's lock-up where he stashed child pornography and practised a sexual kidnapping fantasy with a child-sized mannequin. Scroll down for video . Former Christian radio DJ John Balyo, 36, of Caledonia, Michigan, (pictured with an unidentified child), was sentenced on Thursday to 40 years in prison for raping an 11-year-old boy . According to court records, reported by freep.com, Balyo also kept naked photos of victims, children's obituaries and articles on the infamous BTK (Bind, Torture, Kill) serial killer. The Christian DJ also kept news articles about the death, torture and sexual abuse of children. A piece of notebook paper was found which contained boys' names and phrases like swimming, photo shoot, sleeping/napping, strapped down, boy/cub scout, headlock, abuse and swim lessons. He also had a bondage kit of rolls of duct tape, four pairs of handcuffs, parachute cord, nylon rope, 107 zip ties, a set of rubber gloves, two lengths of 18-inch chain and a padlock. Balyo's 40-year sentence was on top of the 25 years handed down last month in Calhoun County for first-degree criminal sexual conduct. Investigators released this picture of Balyo's bondange kit which he used on child sex victims to act out his pedophile fantasies . The 36-year-old raped the 11-year-old boy in a Battle Creek motel in May - two weeks after his wedding. In August, Balyo pleaded guilty to photographing sex acts with the 11-year-old in May after paying him, then handcuffing the child to a bed. His wife, who is due to give birth to the couple's child in February, was granted a divorce last month. She was granted full custody of the child. In a sentencing statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tessa K. Hessmiller wrote: 'No one ever reported any misgivings or indiscretions about Balyo. But he was a wolf in sheep's clothing. 'But underneath the surface, he was feeding a morbid and sadistic fascination with children, creating and accumulating pedophilic materials, rehearsing a sexual kidnapping fantasy with a gun and a child-sized mannequin and meeting clandestinely in hotel rooms with young boys in bondage. 'Balyo's three meetings with (victim 1) resulted in sexual exploitation and degradation of a child in the most depraved ways.' Balyo, (pictured in an earlier mugshot), is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison for his sadistic sex crimes . If he lives long enough to be released from prison, Balyo will be required to register as a sex offender and wear an electronic monitor for the rest of his life, Battle Creek Inquirer reported. In court last month, Balyo apologized to his 11-year-old victim. He said: 'I just want to take this opportunity to say I am feeling very deep and constant remorse for my actions. 'And I want the family to know I am very sorry and wish I could do something to correct what has been done.' Balyo added: 'I did take images of a child and they were sexually explicit involving bondage and nudity. I performed sex acts as described. I knew it was wrong.' The victim's mother wrote in an impact statement, which was read in court during the sentencing hearing, saying that children should be loved and respected, not 'used and abused' by adults. 'No child should be scared of people or of life itself,' the woman stated. 'I think you should sit and rot in jail the rest of your miserable life.' Balyo, a host at WCSG, was arrested in June at the Big Ticket Christian music festival in Gaylord, Michigan. He admitted at the time that he had a rented storage unit where he kept a 'bondage kit', a federal spokesman confirmed to MailOnline. Handcuffs and other items were found in a suitcase after police searched a storage unit in Plainfield Township. Balyo paid another man, 41-year-old Ronald Moser, to arrange a sex session with a minor for him through a child sex trafficking website he ran. According to Mlive.com, in a photo album posted online by Moser, there were ten images of a young boy lying face down on a bed. His hands and feet were bound and he was wearing only underwear, which had been rolled up to show his buttocks, according to a federal agent. The albums had titles such as 'very cute boy,' and 'sexy boys', police said. The FBI said Moser put images online and planned to trade in child porn. It is alleged that Moser ran a website providing sex with underage boys for money. The investigation into the alleged pedophiles has involved multiple agencies as part of a larger 'Operation Predator'.","John Balyo, 36, of Caledonia, Michigan, was arrested in June as part of a sex trafficking ring bust .

"You would think that it is something that they already have aplenty, but authorities in Dubai has bought a shipload of sand. The Arab emirate is set to receive 1,500-square-metres of specially sifted sand from Germany, which is to be used on the oil rich city's famous racecourse. The local sand is allegedly too unstable for horses to race on, so Dubai is transporting the right type of sand all the way from central Europe.

Officials at Dubai's race tracks and training yards say local sand is 'too coarse' for their multi-million pound thoroughbreds. The owner of German aggregates company Equiterra says he thought it was a practical joke when they were approached by Dubai.

He added: 'We quickly realised, however, that it wasn't, and we're very proud that such a distinguished client chose us.'

Ellekotten explained: 'Local sand is large-grained and rough. It is very bad for horses and is unstable to ride on.'

'And despite the presents, food and Christmas festivities going on during that time, the bumper TV schedule is something which many people are really looking forward to. 'With a number of our favourite films, soaps and dramas all on the box, and fighting for viewers with Christmas specials, it can mean a large amount of that time off work is going to spent in front of the TV.

"Celebrities adorned their most ostentatious festive knitwear to mark Christmas jumper day. From Made In Chelsea cast members to the Arsenal footballers preparing for their match against Newcastle United, celebrities got in the seasonal spirit with garish reindeer, snowmen and Santa sweaters. In the same vein as Movember, the now annual fundraising event is in its third year and has seen the once shunned festive jumper (famously derided in the film 'Love Actually') make a popular return to the high street stores. Samantha Cameron wore a blue-and-white number and spoke with primary school pupils from across the country as they swapped brightly-coloured festive knits they had designed for a competition . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg showed his support for the Save the Children campaign and wrote on his Twitter that he is 'hoping to win the office's most garish Christmas jumper competition. What do you think?' Arsenal players Mikel Arteta, Abou Diaby, Mathieu Flamini, Laurent Koscielny and Joel Campbell strike a pose . Former Made in Chelsea cast member and TV personality Ollie Locke gets in the festive spirit . Tottenham Hotspur players Christian Eriksen and Eric Dier show off their jumpers for the charity . Jockeys, including Tony McCoy (second left), line up in their merry selection of festive gear . At 10 Downing Street, Samantha Cameron donned seasonal knitwear as she joined more than 40 schoolchildren from across the country who exchanged Christmas jumpers. Mrs Cameron, 43, sported a light blue sweater featuring falling snow and two robins which was made by Asda's George, the charity's partner. Never one to miss out on the latest trend, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg posted a picture on Twitter with a cosy Christmas sweater - complete with down-to-earth mug of tea - with the caption: 'Hoping to win the office's most garish Christmas jumper competition.

"Tens of thousands of families have been left in a panic that gifts bought online will not arrive in time for Christmas. Couriers delivering goods for major retailers including Marks and Spencer, John Lewis and Waterstones were last night said to be in chaos as they struggled to deal with huge backlogs. They blamed an unprecedented surge in online shopping over the past fortnight. Scroll down for video . Warning: M&S admitted deliveries were taking up to four days longer than usual as it tries to get on top of a massive backlog . The mayhem has sparked warnings that those who have not yet done their Christmas shopping should consider hitting the high street this weekend rather than doing it online. M&S admitted deliveries were taking up to four days longer than usual as it tries to get on top of a massive backlog. It warned that orders placed tomorrow may not arrive until December 23 and said that delivery times were already up to nine days instead of the usual five. High street stores are set to enjoy bumper sales today as shoppers try to grab a festive bargain and avoid the chaos of online order deliveries. Around £40billion of sales are expected in the run-up to Christmas – and today is predicted to be one of the busiest days, on what some have dubbed White Saturday. The continuing discounts are thought to be a key factor, while the delivery problems for online orders mean many shoppers are likely to brave the cold and pick up presents the old-fashioned way to make sure they have them in time for Christmas. In fact, industry experts said the weather itself could well be a factor in the sales surge, despite the Met Office issuing an ice warning to many areas. Matthew Hopkinson, of retail analysts the Local Data Company, said people shop on the high street for the ‘experience’, adding: ‘The colder weather makes people feel more festive.’ Meanwhile, delivery firms were accused of ‘appalling’ customer service as shoppers complained of two-week delays, lost goods and parcels left behind dustbins, under bushes or even with strangers by over-worked couriers. Yodel, the UK’s largest delivery company after Royal Mail, is unable to collect parcels from retailers this weekend as it is already three days behind on existing orders. It is desperately trying to clear the thousands of gifts already piled up in warehouses, with some couriers even delivering parcels in the middle of the night. The company – employed by a string of retailers including Amazon, Boots, Argos, Waterstones and Tesco Direct – said it will not resume normal collections until Monday at the earliest. But analysts pointed out that by this time thousands more orders will have been placed on what is one of the busiest shopping weeks of the year, sparking fears the situation could get worse. Shoppers are also complaining of delays with CityLink, which delivers parcels for Mothercare and John Lewis, among dozens of others. Those affected included Les Dennis who branded the courier’s service ‘appalling’ on Twitter, while broadcaster Danny Baker complained about his Amazon delivery with CityLink, tweeting: ‘Go to actual shops kids.’ Shoppers flooded social networking sites with stories of delayed Christmas presents, including children’s teddies, clothes and toys, which they feared would not arrive before Christmas. Struggling: Courier firm Yodel, which makes deliveries for the likes of Tesco, Argos and Amazon, is unable to collect parcels from retailers this weekend as it is already three days behind on existing orders . Mayhem: John Lewis and Waterstone's deliveries could also be delayed with couriers blaming an unprecedented surge in online shopping over the past fortnight . Hermes, which delivers for retailers such as ASOS and Zara, tried to appease annoyed customers, writing on Twitter that it was ‘working flat out to reply to your tweets’. The firm suffered a fire at its Warrington warehouse last week, causing two-day delays. Couriers for Yodel are paid as little as 50p per delivery and must deliver up to 160 parcels a day, it is claimed. Yodel, voted the worst parcel service in the UK, delivers for firms from Amazon and Waterstones to Boots and Argos. But complaints have stacked up in the wake of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. There are claims of items left in bushes, in bins or with unknown neighbours, and of deliveries at night. Now stories have emerged of drivers paid just a few pence per parcel. On an online forum where staff rate employers, a man in Nottingham said he was offered the equivalent of 50p a parcel. He said: ‘How they expect you to earn even a half decent wage is beyond me.’ He worked out that by delivering one parcel every six to eight minutes, he would earn £2.50 an hour after deducting petrol, which seasonal couriers must buy. Job ads for seasonal drivers say they work ‘at some pace’, warning: ‘It’s no mean feat.’ A Scottish driver, who spent seven years at Yodel until 2012, said: ‘December is always the worst time. Some workers were out until 10pm. The workers had a target . . . it ranged from 110-160 parcels a day. You couldn’t bring back more than 2 per cent. Guys were coming back with 20 to 30 parcels saying they couldn’t do it. A lot of the workers were off with stress.’ Customers were just as unhappy. Twitter user ‘Yodelhell’ said: ‘All we want is our packages delivered intact. Is it too much to ask?’ Rachel Webber said her order showed she missed a delivery at 1am. She said: ‘I am going to assume I was asleep.’ Yodel said deliveries should be no later than 9pm. A spokesman said many workers had a regular salary but some were self-employed and paid per delivery. Collect+, which allows people to collect their goods from supermarkets and petrol stations, also appeared to be overwhelmed, warning of three-day delays. Delivery firms blamed the chaos on a massive increase in online shopping, fuelled by record sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday two weeks ago. These annual events originated in the US, but have soared in popularity in the UK in recent years. An estimated £810million was spent online on Black Friday which was 50 per cent higher than expected. This was followed by Cyber Monday three days later and then Manic Monday a week later, with a further £666million spent. Retail expert Kate Jones, of Mash Strategy, said: ‘You’ve bought and paid for it, but this year there is no guarantee you’ll receive it in time for Christmas … If you haven’t bought gifts for your loved ones yet then you may be better off hitting the high street.’ Waterstones responded to angry customers yesterday by tweeting that ‘Yodel are currently handling more parcels than they expected, so some deliveries are taking longer than we would like’. On its website, Yodel explained: ‘We spent months planning for Christmas, but even with our experience and those of our clients we underestimated how massive the spikes would be. (We were not alone!) The whole of the retail supply chain has felt the impact. ‘Retailer websites have been crashing, there have been backlogs in distribution centres and all parcel delivery companies have felt the strain.’ Twitter user Frankiebee wrote: ‘Very unhappy with recent JL purchases. Half never arrived and they didn’t call me back when they said they would.’ A John Lewis spokeswoman said: 'All John Lewis delivery systems are working as normal. Customers can shop with confidence and choose the delivery service that best suits their needs. 'Yodel provide the Collect+ delivery service to local newsagents which represents a very small proportion of John Lewis deliveries. 'For any customer orders held at Yodel sites John Lewis has arranged alternative transportation and are currently not taking further orders for this delivery method.' An M&S spokesman said delays meant its in-store Click & Collect service was being offered within two days instead of one. Yesterday, Tesco came under fire after dozens of customers received their orders late. But a spokesman for the firm said: ‘We don’t anticipate any further delays before Christmas.’ Amazon whose Swansea, Wales, warehouse is pictured above, recently announced that their delivery service had been delayed by 'the unprecedented number of orders received during Black Friday Deals Week' Delivery firms blamed the chaos on a massive increase in online shopping, fuelled by record sales on Black Friday two weeks ago. pictured, customers shove eachother at Black Friday Sales in Asda, Wembley .

"Suzanne Gardner, pictured with her grandson Christopher, died after she contracted a rare flesh-eating bug . A grandmother who needed urgent amputation of her arms after she contracted a flesh-eating virus died when doctors only treated her with painkillers, the High Court has heard. Suzanne Gardner, 60, of Blisworth, Northamptonshire, was struck by deadly necrotising fasciitis when she slipped on her driveway and cut her arm just before Christmas in 2010. The fast-moving infection spread up her arms and into her chest and killed her within days. High Court judge, Sir David Eady, today ruled that the Northampton General Hospital NHS Trust was to blame, as he detailed the  inadequate care she was given at the hospital. He said the grandmother-of-six had arrived with her husband in ‘excruciating pain’, with discoloured and swollen arms and one of them covered in weeping blisters. ‘The only treatment she received over the next few hours was in the form of drugs for the relief of pain and the application of gauzes to the suppurating blisters,' he said. ‘What she needed was an emergency operation for the amputation of both arms and, prior to that, by way of preparation, resuscitation by means of oxygen, fluids and antibiotics. ‘By the time her condition was diagnosed, it was too late and death had become inevitable.’ Mrs Gardner’s husband, Colin, sued the NHS Trust, alleging an unjustified delay in her being seen by a doctor and having her blood tested. It meant the infection was not noticed until too late. By the time the decision was taken to remove her arms, it had gone too far and she had no chance. Prior to her going into theatre, Mr Gardner only had time to wish his wife of 40 years good luck and give her a kiss. She died within hours on the afternoon of December 21. Ruling the NHS Trust to blame, Sir David said the triage when she arrived was ‘hopelessly inadequate’, as very little in the way of observations were taken. Mrs Gardener, pictured with her grandson William (left) and on her 60th birthday (right), had slipped on her driveway and cut her arm just before Christmas 2010. She died days later in hospital . They were first taken almost four hours later, which was ‘woefully late’, he continued. ‘Had Mrs Gardner been treated non-negligently during and following her arrival at the hospital, she could have been ready for an amputation well before 7.30am and would then probably have survived,’ he said. ‘That is, she would have lived but for the delay caused by the breaches of duty identified.’ He continued: ‘I find on a balance of probability that Mrs Gardner would have survived an emergency operation for bilateral amputation and debridement for which she could and should have been ready no later than 6.10am, just over five and a half hours after she arrived.’ High Court judge, Sir David Eady, today ruled that the Northampton General Hospital NHS Trust was to blame . Necrotising fasciitis is a rare bacterial infection that affects soft tissue and the tissue binding muscles and organs. It can occur following a cut or surgery when bacteria can enter through weakened skin like a blister. The earliest sign of the bug is people being in severe pain, which seems out of proportion to any external signs of the infection. As it progresses, fever, diarrhoea and vomiting can occur before the person falls unconscious. The skin typically turns a dark violet colour, blister form and the tissue underneath begins to die. Without treatment to remove the affected tissue, the bug will spread rapidly and can result in death. Sir David’s ruling means Mr Gardner is entitled to receive full compensation for the loss of his wife, although the amount will not be revealed. Speaking afterwards, Mr Gardner said: ‘Suzanne was wonderful, she was looking forward to her upcoming retirement and enjoyed cooking Sunday lunches and spending time with our family. ‘It has been a truly horrific time for us. The lack of care Suzanne received from the hospital led to her being taken too soon.’ Andrea Rusbridge, the family’s lawyer at Access Legal from Shoosmiths, added: ‘Mrs Gardner was a huge part of the lives of her whole family, and her loss has been devastating to them. ‘I hope that with this judgement, changes will be implemented in NGH A&E to make sure patients are properly assessed as soon as they arrive and that more lives are saved from this terrifying infection and other illnesses as a result.’","Suzanne Gardner was struck by deadly necrotising fasciitis and died .

"A florist's assistant almost cut off his arm after he slipped while carrying a vase up a flight of stairs and fell on to the shards of glass. Davy D'agostino, who was in his first week in the job helping out a friend, was carrying the heavy, water filled vase when he tumbled with his right arm landing in the glass. It sliced through his forearm to the bone, severing all the tendons, nerves and arteries in his wrist, leaving him in a pool of blood. Davy D'agostino, left, who almost cut off his arm after he slipped while carrying a vase up a flight of stairs. He had to undergo surgery and was bandaged, right after severing all the tendons, nerves and arteries in his wrist . The 37-year-old from Enfield, north London, was rushed to hospital where he spent three days having surgery on his torn tendons. He also had to have more than 30 stitches in his right arm to fix the six inch gash. Mr D'agostino said: 'I only took the job because I thought it would be a quieter way to earn some more money. 'When I slipped I dropped the vase, and it broke. I fell right on top of it and the glass sliced through my arm. 'I sliced open my left hand because I tried to put pressure on the wound and cut myself on a shard of glass that was sticking out of my arm. It was agony.' Mr D'agostino had previously worked as a professional dog handler and had been bitten, but says nothing could have prepared him for the pain. He explained: 'I’ve been a professional dog handler for years, but I’ve never seen a dog bite that bad. Mr D'agostino had to have more than 30 stitches, left, to fix the six inch gash.

"Court claim: Abdel Hakim Belhadj says Britain collaborated in his torture . Silencing a Libyan dissident who claimed Britain helped deliver him to Colonel Gaddafi’s torturers has cost taxpayers almost £400,000. Abdel Hakim Belhadj, an Islamist militant fighter, says he was subjected to ‘extraordinary rendition’ to Libya on the basis of MI6 intelligence and tortured with the help of British spies. He would settle for a token payment of £1 along with an admission and apology, but Government lawyers have spent £372,632 trying to stop the case coming to court. They argue that a full hearing could damage relations with the US. Campaigners reject this, saying the Government simply wants to conceal its involvement in the case. Ministers lost the argument at the Court of Appeal, which ruled in October that a British judge could consider the case even if it covered alleged wrongdoing by government agents. They are appealing against that judgement, meaning the legal bill will rise even further next year when the case comes before the Supreme Court. If the case does eventually come before a judge, ministers face having to reveal in full the extent of Britain’s involvement with Mr Belhadj and his wife Fatima Bouchard, who is also claiming compensation. Legal campaigners said it was indefensible for the Government to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds to stop the public hearing the facts of the case. Donald Campbell, of Reprieve, which is representing Mr Belhadj, said: ‘Surely a case involving such serious issues as rendition and torture deserves its day in court. ‘Mr Belhadj and Miss Bouchard have even offered to drop their case in return for an admission, an apology, and a token payment of £1 from each defendant. ‘Yet instead, the Government is spending staggering amounts of public money trying to ensure it is never heard at all. Sadly, this is all part of a bigger picture of obfuscation by the Government, which only emphasises the importance of holding a proper, independent inquiry into UK involvement in torture.’ A letter found in the bombed-out ruins of Gaddafi’s spy headquarters apparently shows Sir Mark Allen – then head of MI6’s counter-terrorism division – taking credit for handing Mr Belhadj and Miss Bouchard over to the regime. Among Mr Belhadj’s claims is that Sir Mark is guilty of complicity in torture, conspiracy to injury, misfeasance in public office and negligence. The 48-year-old is also suing former foreign secretary Jack Straw. The Treasury Solicitor’s department – the government’s legal office – has revealed it has paid out more than £30,000 on Mr Straw’s defence in the case and more than £113,000 on Sir Mark’s. Deal in the Desert: Tony Blair shakes Colonel Gaddafi's hand at their now notorious meeting of 2004 . Mr Belhadj, a former Afghan mujahedeen who became a leading figure in the Libyan resistance which overthrew the Gaddafi regime, had been attempting to claim asylum in Britain. He was captured in Bangkok in March 2004 and passed into the custody of the CIA who sent him to Tripoli. The CIA plane refuelled in the British Indian Ocean territory of Diego Garcia – raising serious questions about the repeated denials from Labour ministers that the UK had ever been involved in extraordinary rendition. While he was held in Libya, Mr Belhadj says he was questioned by British intelligence officers who he says knew he was being tortured but did nothing to help him. Sir Mark Allen (right), who is accused of handing Abdel Hakim Belhadj over to the Libyans, was also the spy who brought Colonel Gaddafi in from the cold. The former head of MI6 counter-terrorism was the agency’s chief Arabist at the time of Labour’s love-in with the tyrant, and helped pave the way for Tony Blair to visit the dictator in Tripoli in 2004. It was Sir Mark who forged close ties with Gaddafi’s playboy son Saif al-Islam and Libya’s ruthless intelligence chief Musa Kusa. The 61-year-old father of two was on the advisory board of LSE Ideas, a foreign policy thinktank within  the London School of Economics, which tarnished its name by awarding Saif a PhD. Following this the Gaddafi Charity offered a £1.5million donation to the LSE, of which £300,000 was received. After studying Arabic at Oxford, Sir Mark joined the Foreign Office at 23, and developed unparalleled contacts in the Arab world. He allegedly entertained Kusa – also known as Libya’s former torturer-in-chief – at the Travellers Club on Pall Mall in 2003, the year sanctions against Libya were lifted. The pair allegedly worked together closely, with Sir Mark helping Kusa obtain telephone numbers and details of Libyan dissidents in the UK. In one fawning letter found last year, Sir Mark congratulated his counterpart on helping mastermind a PR coup with the ‘deal in the desert’ between Blair and Gaddafi which helped secure drilling rights in Libya for BP and Shell. Shortly afterwards, Sir Mark quit the intelligence service and joined BP as a £200,000-a-year adviser. Details of his case emerged in secret documents found in the ruins of Colonel Gaddafi’s spy agency’s headquarters in September 2011. As the regime crumbled in the face of an onslaught from Western-backed rebel fighters, investigators recovered a message apparently sent by Sir Mark to Musa Kusa, the feared head of Libyan intelligence and Gaddafi’s torturer-in-chief. Crucially the documents appeared to show how he was ‘rendered’ just as Tony Blair was cosying up to the Gaddafi regime as part of the infamous ‘deal in the desert’. In the files was a letter apparently from Sir Mark, dated March 2004, to Kusa, in which he tries to take credit for helping to apprehend Mr Belhadj, saying it was ‘the least we could do for you’. Referring to Mr Belhadj by his alias, he wrote: ‘Amusingly, we got a request from the Americans to channel requests for information from Abu Abd Allah through the Americans. I have no intention of doing any such thing. The intelligence about Abu Abd Allah was British.’ The fax also discussed arrangements for Mr Blair’s visit to Tripoli just weeks later where he would meet the tyrant, and complete a deal on oil and ending his development of weapons of mass destruction. Mr Belhadj’s case is also the subject of a criminal investigation by Scotland Yard. Both he and his wife say they underwent mistreatment at the hands of the Americans while they were held in Thailand and before they were handed over to Gaddafi. He says he was blindfolded, hooded and forced to wear ear defenders before he was hung from a hook in the cell. He was then beaten and the ear defenders removed so loud music could be played into his ears, as he was interrogated by his captors. Miss Bouchard, who was four-and-a-half months pregnant, was allegedly denied food and chained to a wall for five days. In June the Government said Foreign Office files detailing CIA rendition flights on Diego Garcia may have been accidentally destroyed by water damage. But in September it changed its position again, and said only ‘a small number of immigration cards… have been damaged to the point of no longer being useful’. In 2008, David Miliband, the then Labour foreign secretary, had to admit that Diego Garcia had been used twice in 2002 for refuelling of rendition flights in the months after the 9/11 terror attacks. Ministers have consistently denied prisoners ever left the plane or set foot there. But since then there appear to have been more flights. Mr Straw has denied being aware of the rendition and allowing it to happen. Sir Mark has never commented publicly on the case. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘Civil litigation proceedings are under way, so we are unable to comment on the details of this case. ‘The Government has been clear that it stands firmly against torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. We do not condone it, nor do we ask others to do it on our behalf.’","Abdel Hakim Belhadj says he was tortured with the help of British spies .

"Michael Dowd, 28, is the first to admit in court a public disorder offence during the Black Friday discounts which led to a scramble for cheap goods . A greedy Black Friday shopper who punched a Tesco worker during a 'retail riot' has been told he faces jail. Michael Dowd, 28, also threatened to 'smash the face in' of another store assistant when he was ticked off for jumping the queue as he and hundreds of other customers descended on the store in Irlam, near Salford, Greater Manchester. He is the first to admit in court a public disorder offence during last month's discounts which sparked a frenetic scramble for cheap goodies. The mad rush during the Black Friday sales led to scenes of mayhem and violence across the country, with a shocking seven incidents at Tescos in the Greater Manchester area alone. It is thought several of the midnight shoppers had been drinking in nearby pubs until closing time. Manchester magistrates' court heard today Mr Dowd, from Pendleton in Salford, was told off by Tesco worker Julie Veldhoven for jumping in the queue. It was alleged he told Miss Veldhoven, a sales assistant, 'don't get stroppy with me or I'll smash your f***ing face in'. The court heard how she told Mr Dowd to return to the queue and was joined by a male colleague, Darren Herrington, who was then punched in the face by Mr Dowd. Subhanur Chowdhury, prosecuting told the court: 'He didn't see the punch coming and his head was shot back. He suffered a breakage of the skin on his right hand when he tried to protect his face.' Today Mr Dowd pleaded guilty to one count of assault and of using threatening and abusive words or behaviour. Abigail Henry, defending Mr Dowd, said he was convicted of theft from a retail store last month and sentenced to a conditional discharge, which he was now in breach of. She said: 'He is well aware of the seriousness of the matter. He is aware that it could cross the custodial threshold. Mr Dowd does have some alcohol issues.' Mr Dowd was released on bail with a condition not to enter any Tesco store. He will be sentenced on January 21 next year. District Judge Mark Hadfield told him: 'You have pleaded guilty to both offences. Given your previous conviction in court we will have to consider all sentencing options.' Mr Dowd, 28, punched a worker and threatened to 'smash the face in' of another when he was told off for jumping the queue as he and hundreds of other customers descended on this store in Irlam, near Salford . Earlier this week John Ankers, 40, from Hyde, pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour and was fined £110 with £85 costs after causing trouble during the sales. He was arrested outside a Tesco store in Hattersley after swinging a punch at police as he tried to buy cheap alcohol. Police had just advised staff overwhelmed by 300 customers to close the shop just five minutes after its opening to restore order. But when told by an officer he could not buy anything Ankers retorted: 'Who closed it I bet it was you f***ing lot'. He then added: 'Do you want a f***ing go, let's have a f***ing fight, that field outside.' Ankers then swung a fist towards the officer, narrowly missing his head and shouted 'come on then' before being arrested. A third man is awaiting trial for assault over the disturbances.","Michael Dowd, 28, punched a Tesco worker during Black Friday sales .

"The government of Sierra Leone has been forced banned public Christmas celebrations in an attempt to halt the spread of Ebola. Military will be patrolling the streets throughout the West African nation to ensure people to stay indoors during Christmas and New Year in order to get the number of infections under control. Bars and clubs have already been been shut down ahead of the holiday season and all public gatherings are outlawed. Scroll down for video . No need for Band Aid: The government in Sierra Leone has banned public Christmas and New Years celebrations in an attempt to halt the spread of Ebola . Both Christmas and New Years Eve celebrations are off the table this year, the government's Ebola response unit said. Palo Conteh, head of the department, told reporters in the capital Freetown there would be 'no Christmas and New Year celebrations this year'. 'We will ensure that everybody remains at home to reflect on Ebola,' he said. 'Military personnel will be on the streets at Christmas and the New Year to stop any street celebrations,' he said, without saying which areas would be targeted. While Islam is the dominant religion in Sierra Leone, more than 25 per cent of the population is Christian and public gatherings and entertainment are common during the holiday period. Out of control: Healthcare workers at Kono Government Hospital tend to a suspected Ebola victim on the walkway that connects two hospital buildings in Koidu City, Kono District, Sierra Leone . Conteh did not give the exact dates of the crackdown or list any exceptions. During previous local and nationwide anti-Ebola curfews, people were allowed out to worship and for 'essential business'. Under current emergency regulations, bars and nightspots have already been shut down and public gatherings outlawed but there is no general ban on going outdoors or working. Sierra Leone, which has overtaken Liberia to become the country worst affected by Ebola, has recorded 1,319 new infections in the last three weeks. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday there were 17,942 cases of the tropical fever across eight countries as of December 7, resulting in 6,388 deaths - almost all in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone reported 397 new cases during the week ending December 7 - three times as many as Liberia and Guinea combined, WHO said. Sources with knowledge of government policy said detailed instructions on the workings of the Christmas curfew would be announced shortly. The country now counts a total of 7,897 Ebola cases, including 1,768 deaths, according to Wednesday's tally. A full third of the new cases, or 133 of them, were reported in Freetown, at the heart of the ongoing surge in cases seen in the west of the country. Sierra Leone has already quarantined around half its population of six million, sealing off districts across the country in a bid to combat the Ebola outbreak. The government imposed a two-week lockdown on the eastern diamond mining district of Kono on Wednesday after eight cases of Ebola were confirmed in one day. The WHO's national Ebola coordinator Olu Olushayo said doctors and nurses were 'at their wits' end.' In the space of 11 days, two WHO teams buried 87 victims, including a nurse and an ambulance driver enlisted to help dispose of corpses piling up in the local hospital, the agency said. The government reacted with surprise to the WHO's claims, however, saying Friday they did not tally with reports from the ground and announcing that investigators had been sent to assess the situation in Kono. Local media said officials at the district's main public hospital in Koidu had also been taken aback by the reports. Aiah Beyonquee, the leader of the local burial team, told the state-run Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation no bodies had been stacked at the hospital. 'On Wednesday we had about 10 alert calls for death cases in the community which we reacted to,' he told the broadcaster. 'There were also five deaths in the hospital and all these were buried the same day.'","Sierra Leone bans public Christmas celebrations due to Ebola breakout .

"From crawling under homes in search of the deadly brown snake to saving pets from giant pythons – it’s just another typical day for Richie Gilbert. It all started at the age of five when he showed his mum his catch of the day. Not only was it the first snake he had ever caught, it was one of the world’s most venomous - the copperhead. But that close encounter with disaster didn't deter the boy from the Sunshine Coast from turning his backyard hobby  into a career as a qualified snake catcher. Scroll down for video . Richie Gilbert was called to a home recently where he found the large carpet python had devoured chickens . ‘A lot of people think it’s a dangerous job but to me, I feel like it’s not dangerous at all,’ Mr Gilbert told Daily Mail Australia. 'There are people risking their lives everyday - like electricians or people parachuting and jumping out of planes - to me that's dangerous but its all relative to risk management. ‘But I've been doing it for a long time and I can't put my finger on what attracted me to them but I have always loved chasing snakes since I was little. 'And I love snakes for different reasons - like the venomous ones give me an adrenaline kick when I catch them.' Mr Gilbert, who owns the Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24/7, has been catching snakes since the age of five . Gilbert's colleague Stuart McKenzie recently removed an eastern brown snake on a job. Mr Gilbert added: 'It's the most beautiful one I've ever seen - it's orange incase you didn't notice!' The Queensland resident runs his own business called Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24/7, which operates 24 hours and seven days a week. ‘It’s been quite busy during the summer season and I’ve been getting a lot of phone calls and text messages for identification or to attend homes to locate and remove snakes if necessary', he said. ‘There have been some interesting calls lately. On Thursday, I got called to a home after their Labrador alerted its owner that there was a medium sized carpet python in the kennel. ‘When I arrived, they had taped up the door to trap it but it isn’t the first time I have come across snakes in kennels and it certainly won’t be the last. ‘Just recently, someone texted me a picture of an American corn snake – I thought it was a joke but it was actually sitting on an old couple’s front porch so I had to get down there right away. 'But by the time I arrived, it wasn't there anymore. Luckily they’re not venomous but they’re classed as a pest and pose a huge threat to our wildlife, which we must find urgently before she lays any eggs.’ He was called to a home in the Sunshine Coast to save a pet cat from this python which was waiting to pounce . Mr Gilbert has been quite busy during the summer season, with number phone calls and texts daily . Snake catcher Richie Gilbert came to the rescue when he was called to a home on the Sunshine Coast . Despite many years of experience, Mr Gilbert said he has never had any training. ‘A lot of people ask me how I’ve learnt to catch snakes but I can’t remember a day where I’m not catching them – I’ve been doing it for a long time and I guess it was just self-taught. ‘Growing up, Steve Irwin played a passion that I had. I remember watching his shows and thinking “that’s what I do too!” and it stirred me on from there.’ While Mr Gilbert makes his job sound too easy, he said he has had some of the scariest moments. ‘Just recently, I did something really stupid – I crawled underneath a home and it was just two foot off the ground to catch an eastern brown snake. Despite many years of experience, Mr Gilbert said he has never had any training and was self-taught . The family Labrador alerted the owners when it found a carpet python in its kennel. The owners taped up the door to trap it inside the kennel until Mr Gilbert arrived to remove it . ‘Crawling on my tummy, trying to locate it which in hind sight – I shouldn’t have done – but when I looked up, it was right above my head, looking at me like “what are you doing?” so I slowly backed out. ‘The owner passed me a pool stick to try and get it out and it dropped to the ground just two metres from my face and looked straight at me in a defence position – it’s what they do when they feel threatened and vulnerable. ‘It was stupid and dumb – I managed to catch it safely but it wasn’t the end of it. The owner’s Labrador was coming at me so I had the snake in one hand and trying to scare the dog with my leg – it was crazy.' After Mr Gilbert catches the reptiles, he releases them back into the wild. 'We try to release them in the same geographical area and I don't like to take them too far away from where they were found. But it has to be a far distance away so they don't come back,' he said. 'But if it's a venomous snake, a lot more thought goes into them and we try to release them far away as possible from residential areas.' When it doubt about spotting a snake, Mr Gilbert suggests the best thing to do in a situation is move away slowly and try to take a photograph from a safe distance . The avid snake catcher has been catching snakes at a very young age and hasn't stopped since . Mr Gilbert said the most venomous snakes Australians should be aware of at the moment is the eastern brown snakes, which are the second most venomous snakes in the world. When it doubt about spotting a snake, Gilbert suggests the best thing to do in a situation is move away slowly and try to take a photograph from a safe distance. 'Send it to us and we can identify it for you and if it’s venomous or not and whether we need to come out to catch it ourselves and relocate them,' he said. 'If the snake is found inside a home in one of the rooms, it's best to close the room and pop a towel underneath the door and then call us. ‘Be smart about it because 90 percent of the time, people who are bitten are often trying to kill it or scare it away. ‘All snakes want to do is get away but if it doesn’t feel it can escape, it’ll strike – so be sensible when you spot them.’ For more information, please visit Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24/7. Snakes are a common component of backyard fauna. But these key points will help you take precautions around the home to reduce the likelihood of a negative encounter.

"Rose Clayton Cochran - who became a focal point in the re-election campaign of her husband, Sen. Thad Cochran, when a man was accused of taking bedridden photos of her to use against the Republican - has died. She was 73. She passed away Friday at a hospice facility in Ridgeland, Mississippi, after a long battle with dementia, the senator's spokesman, Chris Gallegos, said. Daughter Kate Cochran, an associate professor at the University of Southern Mississippi, posted on Facebook a photo of her holding her mother's hand. In this June 7, 1978 photo, Thad Cochran embraces his wife, Rose, as he greets supporters after winning the GOP nomination in his race for the U.S. Senate, in Mississippi - Mrs Cochran died Friday . 'My beloved mother died this morning, after two weeks in hospice care. I took this picture a few days ago because a friend of mine remembered how beautiful her hands were,' she wrote. From Washington, where he was waiting Friday to vote on a spending bill to avoid a government shutdown, Cochran, 77, issued a brief statement saying that he and his family are grateful to those who cared for his wife during her extended illness. She had lived in a nursing home for 13 years. Cochran remained in Mississippi after Thanksgiving to spend time with his family and had returned to Washington on Monday to deal with the budget and other issues, Gallegos said. During the senator's campaign this year, a man was arrested and accused of sneaking in to the nursing home, taking pictures of a bedridden Rose Cochran without permission, and posting her image on the Internet for a brief time as part of a political video criticizing the six-term senator. Investigators have said conspirators intended to use images to advance allegations that her husband was having an inappropriate relationship. Longterm loves: The Cochrans - pictured here in 1978 - had been married since 1964, they have two children and three grandchildren . Mrs Cochran passed away at a hospice facility after a long battle with dementia . Thad Cochran has denied any inappropriate acts. Clayton Kelly, a supporter of Cochran's GOP primary opponent Chris McDaniel, was indicted in October on charges of burglary, attempted burglary and conspiracy. If convicted on all three counts, he faces a maximum 55 years in prison. A trial is scheduled for March. The conspiracy count accuses Kelly of working with John Bertram Mary, a talk radio host, who has since pleaded guilty in exchange for five years' probation and no jail time. Ridgeland attorney Mark Mayfield also was charged with conspiracy but later committed suicide. Cochran defeated McDaniel in the June 24 Republican primary runoff, then won a seventh term in November. Conservative blogger Clayton Thomas Kelly is accused of taking a picture of Rose Cochran in her nursing home without permission, and posting her image on the Internet for a brief time . Investigators have said conspirators intended to use images to advance allegations that her husband was having an inappropriate relationship - Thad Cochran has denied any inappropriate acts . Rose Cochran's funeral services are 11 am Tuesday at St. Andrew's Cathedral in Jackson. Burial will be in New Albany. The Cochrans had been married since 1964. They have two children and three grandchildren. Rose Cochran was born in Memphis, Tennessee, grew up in New Albany, Mississippi, and graduated from the University of Mississippi in 1963. The couple had met at Ole Miss, where Sen. Cochran attended law school. Rose Cochran taught high school Spanish and English in Oxford, Mississippi, before the couple moved to Jackson, where Thad Cochran had joined a law firm.

"Migrants were driving hundreds of miles to obtain fraudulent passes in the so-called Life in the UK test, a report reveals. Applicants for British citizenship must pass a multiple choice exam on English history, laws, and public services. The exam is taken on a computer in supposedly strict conditions. However, the chief inspector of immigration said that, at one unnamed test centre, evidence of fraud had been unearthed – dealing another hammer blow to the credibility of the system. Scroll down for video . Officials became suspicious of the testing centre when they discovered applicants were driving significant distances in order to sit their Life in the UK exam there. File image used . Migrants were allowed to take the test, administered by Learn Direct on behalf of the Home Office, at any centre they wanted nationwide. Officials became suspicious when ‘applicants were travelling significant distances to complete their test at a specific centre’. Yesterday’s report revealed how ‘investigations concluded that the staff at the centre were colluding with applicants in committing fraud’. It went on: ‘As a direct result, the booking system was strengthened to give applicants the option of only five centres where they could take the test, based on a postcode check.’ Migrants were allowed to take the test, administered by Learn Direct on behalf of the Home Office, at any centre they wanted nationwide . The Home Office has now also introduced new checks to make it harder for applicants to cheat – such as verifying their identity using fingerprints. This is intended to prevent people sitting the test on behalf of somebody else who speaks no English. Earlier this year, a Mail investigation revealed how migrants who can speak no English were being secretly waived through a separate ‘secure’ language test in return for just £500. The scam focused on exam centres which are supposed to test if a person can speak English to at least a basic level – also a requirement of the citizenship process. Learn Pass Succeed (LPS) - which had four branches in London – was filmed agreeing to sell pass certificates to migrants who did not even bother to attend.","Life in the UK exam tests knowledge on history, laws and public services .

"David Warner riled India with his words and willow, vowing he won't curtail the verbals as Australia claimed a 363-run lead at stumps on day four of the first Test. Warner scored a second century in the match, swapping barbs with Indians Varun Aaron, Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan during a heated Friday at Adelaide Oval. As the ball clattered into the stumps, Aaron celebrated by yelling out 'c'mon!' to his team-mates. Scroll down for video . After three days of great respect between Australia and India, traditional hostilities which have marked recent matches between the two nations, have resumed on day four of the first cricket Test after David Warner reacted to being bowled by a no-ball from young paceman Varun Aaron . Warner taunted the bowler again when he let the next ball pass through with another audible and sarcastic 'c'mon'. But a review of the dismissal found he had over-stepped and the umpires called Warner back to the middle. The first innings centurion looked directly at the fast bowler and mouthed 'c'mon' on several occasions. Tempers flared, with non-striker Shane Watson also becoming involved as other Indian players chastised Warner for his reaction. Shane Watson of Australia has words with the Indian players during day four of the First Test match between Australia and India at Adelaide Oval . Shikhar Dhawan of India exchanges words with Shane Watson of Australia during day four of the First Test match between Australia and India at Adelaide Oval . Tempers flared, with non-striker Shane Watson becoming involved as other Indian players chastised Warner for his reaction . The umpires were forced to intervene and asked them all to cool down. 'The world knows that I like to get involved and that's how I play my cricket. I take it to them. If I have to be a bit verbal I will,' Warner said after scoring 102 as Australia progressed to 5-290 in their second innings. 'Sometimes I cross the line, though I try not to. 'I don't know if the temperature got to 40 degrees plus, but I think it was getting to a few people out there. 'It happens.' Let's calm down says Virat Kohli to Shane Watson after the Australian batsman exchanged heated words with some of the Indian fielders on day four . Let's calm down says Virat Kohli to Shane Watson after the Australian batsman exchanged heated words with some of the Indian fielders on day four . Ajinkya Rahane insisted there was no bad blood between his side and Warner. 'It's going to happen and it's really good for the game,' Rahane said. Warner was dropped on 89, while Aaron was gobsmacked when a leg-side caught behind appeal was turned down with the opener on 70. It was all the more frustrating for the visitors, given Warner had been bowled by Aaron on 66 in the 34th over. Peacemaker. India captain Virat Kohli does his best to diffuse the situation between David Warner and Varun Aaron at the Adelaide Oval . 'C'mon'. David Warner has a mid-pitch discussion with Indian captain Virat Kohli after he was recalled on a no-ball dismissal by young paceman Varun Aaron . The express paceman, no-doubt a little testy after part-timers Murali Vijay and Rohit Sharma were thrown the ball before him, gave Warner a send-off. Replays showed Aaron overstepped so Warner was recalled, prompting the pugnacious batsman to return serve. Shane Watson, Kohli and Dhawan all joined the ruckus before umpire Ian Gould eventually brokered peace. Back on day one Varun Aaron put David Warner under pressure early in the innings with the first bouncer of the Test series . Virat Kohli hit on the helmet by Mitchell Johnson on day three which saw the entire Australian team rush in to check on the welfare of the Indian skipper . There was another spotfire in the third session, an unrealistic lbw appeal from Rohit Sharma triggering a kerfuffle involving Smith and Kohli. 'When things don't go your way, you sort of get the adrenaline up,' Warner said of the opposition. 'There are a few send-offs here and there ... that's cricket.' Mitchell Johnson was consoled by Australian captain Michael Clarke after striking his Indian counterpart with a short delivery. But the spirit of cricket has been tested on day four as both sides exchanged words in the middle . Discussion at Adelaide Oval otherwise turned from Michael Clarke's degenerative discs to the timing of his declaration. Clarke was dismissed for seven, but he dived for a catch while fielding and looked sprightly compared to when his chronic back injury flared up on day one. Despite initial fears the skipper's summer could be over, he is now well placed to be a surprise starter in the second Test. David Warner celebrated his first century on Day One of the First Test, on Tuesday, at Adelaide Oval before managing to score a second century during the game on Friday . 'Never been more proud!' David appeared to be lifting his cap and his bat to the skies in memory of Phillip Hughes, in the photo Candice posted on her Instagram after  his second century on Friday . Before that decision is made, Clarke must resolve when to call his teammates in. 'We've got 98 overs tomorrow, we've got to try and hussle through our overs to try and take 10 wickets,' Warner said. The highest victorious fourth-innings Test total at the venue was Australia's 6-315 in 1902. India scored 445 in a loss almost 40 years ago in Adelaide, while South Africa's stonewall in the epic 2012 draw will be in the forefront of Clarke's mind. Offspinner Nathan Lyon finished with first-innings figures of 5-134, flighting the ball and attacking the rough created by Ishant Sharma's footmarks. 'He was hitting it (the rough) virtually every delivery. That's going to be the key for us,' Warner said. The most recent five-wicket haul by an Australian tweaker in a home Test against India came from Bob Simpson in 1968.","The Australian and Indian teams exchanged words in the middle of the ground at the Adelaide Oval today .

"Kasey Naylor, 14, died  weeks after she was prescribed prescription drugs not licensed for children . A troubled teenager died after being given prescription medication which was only meant for adults, an inquest heard. Kasey Naylor, 14, was found lifeless in bed just weeks after being handed the anti-psychotic drug quetiapine and anti-depressant, sertraline. Both are unlicensed for use in children, Manchester Coroner's Court heard, although the consultant psychiatrist who prescribed them said they were 'commonly used' to treat youngsters. Kasey who attended Manchester Creative and Media Academy started to self harm in June 2013 and in September this year she was admitted to hospital after she cut her arm badly and threatened to kill herself. Dr David Ochando prescribed quetiapine after seeing Kasey at North Manchester General on September 10 last year and agreed to discharge her the next day after she had shown no sign of low blood pressure, a common side-effect. Quetiapine is an anti-psychotic drug used to treat bipolar and schizophrenia. When he saw her again nine days later he also prescribed the anti-depressant sertraline as quetiapine is only considered a short-term remedy for emotional problems, the inquest heard. Sertraline affects chemicals in the brain that may become unbalanced and cause depression, panic, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Although not recommended for patients under 18 years old, the inquest was told by a medical experts that use of such drugs is common and that the risk of death 'extremely rare.' Dr Ochando saw her a third time at her home on September 25, when she mentioned she had not been taking sertraline as she 'didn't see the point.' Kasey's mother Paula Longhorn wept as she told the hearing: 'She was just my Kasey. She was just everything. She was lovely.' Coroner Nick Stanage reviewed her statement and said: 'You say she had a few problems at school. 'Kasey had cut herself so badly at school that it required hospital treatment. 'You went to school and were told that Kasey had put a knife to her own throat and she said she would kill herself. Kasey Naylor's mother Paula Longhorn described the teenager, pictured, as her 'everything' and said she 'was lovely' 'While she was at the hospital Kasey had to be restrained but then she was discharged later that night.' Mrs Longhorn replied: 'She told me about what she was going. Sometimes she would show me the cuts and sometimes she wouldn't. 'School would ring up and say she needs to go to the hospital because she has cuts on her arms.' The coroner recounted the morning Mrs Longhorn found her daughter unresponsive in her bed at her home in Newton Heath, Manchester, on October 8. 'You entered Kasey's room and the alarm was still going off,' said the coroner. 'Kasey was a funny colour. You touched her and she was cold.' Attempts to resuscitate Kasey were carried out but she was later declared dead. Her psychiatrist Dr David Ochando told the inquest that the use of unlicensed drugs such as Quetiapine are commonly used for children. He said: 'There are very few medications that have a licence for young people or children and that is in regards to mental health issues. 'Like many other medications it has a licence to be used for psychiatric illness in adults - for people with bipolar. 'But these groups of medication that do not have a license are not recommended for people under 18. 'There are a number of reasons why. It is very difficult to find evidence that they work on children.' When asked by the family if there were any licensed medications he could have prescribed, Dr Ochando said: 'They are all unlicensed. There is no licensed medication for children that age.' A pathologist, who conducted a post mortem examination on the teenager, was unable to determine a cause of Kasey's death. Forensic pathologist, Mark Tyler said: 'Quetiapine is a anti-psychotic drug used for schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorders. It is reported to have some adverse effects when taken therapeutically including drowsiness and headaches. 'There are also reports of effects to the heart. It can affect the rhythm of your heart beat and can lead to irregular heart rhythm although this is considered to be extremely rare. The cause of a cardiac event would increase with a higher dose. 'Quetiapine is not generally recommended for children under 18. There is a lack of clinical trials to support its use rather than a specific risk of prescribing it for that age group. Therefore it may be prescribed for under 18s in some instances. The risk of cardiac event is extremely small when used in therapeutic doses.' Coroner Mr Stanage recorded an open verdict and said: 'I cannot say it was an accident or accidental death. 'I cannot say it was drugs-related or related to prescribed drugs as the evidence is the medication was prescribed only in therapeutic doses or levels.'","Kasey Naylor died on October 8 after being found lifeless in her bed .

"English MPs could be given a ‘veto vote’ over laws which do not apply to the rest of the UK under radical constitutional reforms to be published next week. David Cameron will publish proposals aimed at delivering English votes for English laws and rectifying the growing imbalance with the devolved nations. Tory sources said the plans would give English MPs a ‘decisive say’ in laws which applied only to their constituents and not to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scroll down for video . David Cameron will publish proposals aimed at delivering English votes for English laws and rectifying the growing imbalance with the devolved nations . Among three proposals to be put forward by the Government will be a new ‘veto’ or ‘consent’ option which will mean English MPs have the ‘final say’ on English laws going through the Commons. Following a committee stage of English MPs, Bills could then be amended by MPs from the rest of the UK in the Commons. But English MPs would then get a further veto vote before a Bill became law. And after Ed Miliband had previously called for the issue to be referred to a constitutional committee, Labour yesterday made its first significant step towards accepting some form of English Home Rule. Shadow ministers Hilary Benn and Sadiq Khan backed the idea of an English-only committee for Bills that will not apply elsewhere in the UK, as it would ‘strengthen England’s voice’ at Westminster. However this option lacks the critical final veto. Labour yesterday made its first significant step towards accepting some form of English Home Rule . Labour’s plan was initially suggested by former Commons clerk Sir William McKay in his Government-commissioned report on the issue last year. Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘The situation since has moved on now that more powers are being devolved to the Scottish Parliament . But Sir William himself has questioned whether his proposals are still relevant given the further devolution to Scotland following the independence referendum. He said they would need a ‘hefty tweak’. A Tory source said Labour had ‘spent months denying there was a problem and then latched on to a plan even its author says is outdated’. Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘The situation since the McKay report has moved on now that more powers are being devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The case for English votes for English laws can no longer be ignored and must be delivered. ‘And we believe it should happen in tandem with further devolution to Scotland.’ He added that Labour was simply trying to ‘kick this issue into the long grass’. Details of the Government’s other two proposals were not clear last night. However Tory backbenchers will be consulted over the plans in the coming weeks, and ministers are negotiating further with Lib Dems to put the final choice to a vote before the General Election. Last month the Smith Commission set out a new deal for Scotland following its rejection of independence that will see it control income tax, VAT revenues and the introduction of new benefits.","PM to publish proposals aimed at delivering English votes for English laws .

"A mother, whose son became seriously ill after drinking her raw, organic, cow's milk smoothie, has revealed that he 'turned grey' and suffered kidney failure in the days following the incident. The one-year-old boy spent ten days in hospital after he helped himself to sips of his mother's smoothie and contracted a serious E.coli infection. Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, the Melbourne tot's mother said her son developed vomiting and diarrhoea after drinking the milk, which is sold as 'bath milk'. Scroll down for video . A mother, whose son became seriously ill after drinking her raw, organic, cow's milk smoothie, has revealed that he 'turned grey' and suffered kidney failure in the days following the incident . ""He turned grey, became extremely lethargic and extremely thirsty and was he still sporadically vomiting,"" she said. By the time he reached the Royal Children's Hospital Emergency Department in late October, he only had 20 per cent kidney function. He is expected to make a full recovery after doctors worked to increase his red blood cells. The news comes after a three-year-old from the Mornington Peninsula, south-east of Melbourne, died after allegedly drinking the bath milk earlier this week. Four other children under the age of five also fell seriously ill after it's believed they drank raw milk. The company who sell the raw milk in question, Mountain View Farm, has voluntarily pulled its range of organic bath milk products off the shelves of heath food stores after the milk was linked to the death of the toddler. Mountain View Farm issued a statement on its Facebook page on Friday telling customers the product was being voluntarily recalled following a request from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). 'We have been asked by the ACCC to do a voluntary recall,' the statement said. The news comes after a three-year-old from the Mornington Peninsula, south-east of Melbourne, died after allegedly drinking the bath milk earlier this week . 'If anyone has purchased Mountain View Bath Milk, please either dispose of the container or return to the place of purchase for a refund.' Victoria's health department has warned people against drinking raw milk after the three-year-old died. Unpasteurised cow's milk has been banned in Australia for more than 70 years but manufacturers can sell it as a cosmetic product rather than food. The product is advertised on the family-run company's website as 'amazing fresh 'raw bath milk'… dropped off to the farm store every Thursday for pick up'. ACCC deputy chair Delia Rickard urged consumers not to drink the milk. 'The message from health agencies is clear: do not drink unpasteurised milk,' she said. 'If you have this product, do not drink it in any circumstances.' Regulators are considering whether raw milk labels mislead consumers, with the product often sold alongside consumable milk products. Chief health officer Dr Rosemary Lester said some people were choosing to drink raw milk because they believed it was healthier than pasteurised milk. Mountain View Farm owner Vicki Jones told the Herald Sun her company always advised people not to drink the product. 'What people do with milk when they take it home, I can't tell them what to do,' she said. Ms Jones said the company already labelled their milk with warnings that it was not for consumption, in accordance with health department regulations, but was happy to make any recommended changes. 'We've told them we're happy to add extra labelling and warnings to the milk,' she said. 'We're happy to comply with whatever they request.' The raw milk is often sold in fridges near to the pasteurised drinking milk and its packaging looks similar to that of regular milk. There has been a resurgence in people wanting to drink raw milk as part of a belief that raw and unprocessed food is healthier. They claim it is more nutritious, easier to digest and contains probiotics - and that it's better for cows and farms. Dr Rosemary Lester (left) from Victoria's Department of Health has issued a health warning. The raw milk is often sold near pasteurised milk (right) However, Dr Lester warned that raw milk can affect the kidneys and the bloodstream and cause watery diarrhoea. In addition 'only a small number of these pathogens are needed to cause illness,' Dr Lester said. She said unpasteurised milk could make anyone sick but risks were greatest for young children and elderly, pregnant or otherwise unhealthy people. 'Since the 1940s, it has been compulsory to pasteurise cow's milk in Australia,' Dr Lester said. 'Milk is heated for a very short period of time, effectively destroying any disease-causing bacteria which may be present in raw milk.' Dr Lester has referred the matter to Consumer Affairs Victoria and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), saying bath milk packaging was very similar to drinking milk and they could be easily confused. Consumer Affairs Victoria director Dr Claire Noone says the watchdog will review the marketing of raw milk and work with the ACCC to establish whether there had been a breach of consumer law. 'In Victoria it is illegal to package, deliver or provide raw milk for human consumption. However, it still may be labelled and sold for cosmetic use,' she said in a statement on Thursday. An ACCC spokesperson said the commission would consider the adequacy of labelling but urged consumers to follow safety instructions on product packaging. The State Coroner will investigate the child's death. Dr Lester says on the Department's website: 'The Department has been notified of a number of illnesses including three cases of Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) and two cases of cryptosporidiosis. All cases have consumed unpasteurised (raw) milk which is sold as 'bath' or 'cosmetic' milk in Victoria.' She explained: 'Cryptosporidiosis is a parasitic infection that commonly presents are gastroenteritis with watery diarrhoea. 'HUS is a rare condition which can be caused by shiga toxin and verotoxin producing E.coli that affects the kidneys and the bloodstream. Children are most susceptible to contracting HUS, which begins with abdominal pains and bloody diarrhoea which can last for about a week. 'Serious cases of HUS can lead to renal failure and death. Only small numbers of these pathogens are needed to cause illness.' Because the products are classed as cosmetic and are marked 'not for human consumption' the department has no power to recall them. Dr Lester said: 'In Australia, the sale of unpasteurised (raw) cow's milk for human consumption is illegal. In Victoria, it is also illegal to package, deliver or provide unpasteurised (raw) milk for human consumption. Unpasteurised milk is sometimes labelled and sold for cosmetic use only. 'Packaging of unpasteurised milk is often very similar to other milk products. 'Unpasteurised milk should not be consumed.'","A Melbourne mother has spoken out about her son's brush with death .

"The average house in the UK earned more than the average worker in the last year, as house prices rose at their fastest rate in almost a decade. A study found that house prices increased by 12 per cent – or £29,339 - over the last twelve months, while the average worker took home earnings of £27,271. The research, compiled by the Centre for Economics and Business Research for the Post Office, shows that more than 60 per cent of the working population earned less than the average home. A study found that house prices increased by 12 per cent – or £29,339 - over the last twelve months, while the average worker took home earnings of £27,271. File picture . A typical home’s earnings now outpace those of a number of our most-relied upon professions, and significantly exceed the starting salaries of a junior hospital doctor (£22,636), a graduate nurse (£21,388), a teacher (£22,023), a police officer (£23,317) and a soldier (£17,945). Commenting on the findings, John Willcock, head of mortgages at Post Office said: 'Property prices have soared over the last year, following a long period of recovery – and are set to increase further over the next five years. 'Whilst this is good news for those that already own their home, our study highlights the struggle that buyers and movers looking to climb the property ladder face, especially in getting on that all-important first rung.” Growth: A typical home’s earnings now outpace those of a number of  a graduate nurse - £21,388 . Homeowners in the East, South East and London saw their earnings outclassed the most – with properties in each region earning £34,002, £35,188, and £80,462 respectively. Houses in the nation’s capital earned £80,462 – almost twice as much as the average London salary (£41,095). They now earn more than the average earnings of a fully qualified doctor in the UK (£70,648). It also emerged that the rate at which houses earn is climbing. The average home earned more than £20,000 more this year than it did in the previous one (£8,954 compared to £29,339) as the market boomed. In contrast, while house prices grew 12 per cent over the last 12 months, the average worker saw their pay increase by just 0.6 per cent. Mr Willcock adds: 'Forecasts indicate that this year’s strong house price growth will most likely be followed by a slight contraction of 0.8 per cent in 2015, as the market responds to the Mortgage Market Review (MMR) guidance. 'One of the impacts of MMR is a lengthening in transaction times and more rigorous criteria, meaning the overall process of buying and moving is taking longer. 'However, as demand for properties remains high those on the hunt for first homes and dream properties will continue to face substantial costs. Another factor contributing to this contraction is the decline in demand from overseas buyers which has affected house prices in the capital.'

"Mohammed Rafiq, was today found guilty of arranging the attack in revenge for Miss Horsman, 20, breaking up with him . This is the 80-year-old man who hired two thugs to throw acid in the face of his ex-girlfriend when he became convinced that the 20-year-old was seeing another man after their relationship ended. Vikki Horsman was left horribly burned and disfigured after she was doused with the sulphuric acid as she went to answer the door at her friend's house in Tividale, West Midlands. Her ex-lover, Mohammed Rafiq, was today found guilty of arranging the attack in revenge for Miss Horsman, who had converted to Islam during their relationship, breaking up with him. Pakistan-born Rafiq persuaded Steven Holmes, 25, and Shannon Heaps, 22, to carry out the attack and initially pretended he was also a victim after he too was splashed by the acid. All three were today found guilty at Wolverhampton Crown Court of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. They will be sentenced next Friday. The court heard that Miss Horsman converted to Islam and even changed her name to Aleena Rafiq after meeting the pensioner, more than six times her senior, when she was just 14 years old. She had described the breakdown of her relationship with Rafiq, who she had been sleeping with since she was 18. Rafiq, whom she had known six years, had bought her a car, but became increasingly 'very controlling' she told the court. 'He often accused me of cheating on him,' she said. Describing the moment she was attacked, Miss Horsman, who was 19 at the time, said: 'I went out into the porch and shut the door behind me. I looked outside and that was when I saw the gentleman standing there. 'He asked if I was Vikki, I said yes and that was when the substance was thrown over me. I felt a burning in my face and lips. 'I ran to the mirror to see what was happening. Then I ran to the kitchen, and splashed water over my face to try and get rid of it. 'I tried to call an ambulance but they couldn't understand what I was saying, I was just screaming. 'I asked Mohammed to call them and give them the address. I can't remember him doing anything else.

'I was splashing water on my face. Mohammed gave me a bottle of water as I could feel it burning inside my mouth.' She said he had pressured her to become a Muslim in November last year - even though she had not wanted to. She ended the relationship a month later but Rafiq could not accept the break-up and believed they were still together, the court heard. She added: 'He became a lot more controlling. He wanted to know where I was a lot more. He kept checking up on me to make sure I was where I said I was.' 'He still thought we were in a relationship even thought I told him it was over. He got very angry. 'One day I came home from shopping and he was there. 'He told me he had found condom wrappers in my bed side drawer. He showed me pictures he had taken on his phone. He was angry, he accused me of sleeping with somebody else.'

Miss Horsman suffered 8 per cent burns to her body and told the court she was still receiving treatment for her injuries. Speaking after the case, Detective Constable Jason Moseley, investigating officer for West Midlands Police, said: 'This was a horrifying and complex case which centred around a controlling relationship. 'Rafiq's young ex-partner was seriously injured and left with devastating, lasting scars, which one can only presume was his intent given the nature of the planned attack. 'He recruited two people to carry out the attack on his behalf and then tried to claim that he was also a victim. 'His victim now has to rebuild her life and move on from what was ultimately a controlling, abusive relationship that she paid a high price to leave..' Miss Horsman, was 19 when she was attacked at her friend's home in Tividale, West Midlands (pictured). Describing the moment in court, she said she felt burning in her face and lips when the acid hit . Speaking following the trial, Miss Horsman said: 'What happened that day changed my life forever.

"It's rare. It's orderly. And when it comes to remembering an anniversary date, it's as easy as 12/13/14. Saturday's December 13, 2014, represents the last sequential calendar date for at least 20 years (Jan. 2, 2034) and another 89 years if waiting for Jan. 2, 2103. If a person has a heart set on commemorating the next 12/13/14, make sure that heart can stand another 100 years on earth to make it to Dec. 13, 2114. For cryogenic fans, it's 1,000 years until 3014. Getting married on 12/13/14? Saturday's December 13, 2014, represents the last sequential calendar date for at least 20 years, making it a popular choice for weddings . A sequence comes sooner for math nerds with pi. The day is mere months away on March, 14 (Get it? 3.1415 ....) The dates represent a lucky list of number for some gamblers and certainly a memorable birth date for others. Lottery players looking for a bit of extra luck love these kinds of quirky number combos. On Sept. 11, 2002, the winning numbers in New York State's Pick 3 game were 9-1-1. A total of 5,631 people picked the winning sequence; the combination was picked so many times, the numbers were closed out. Maura McCann, a spokeswoman for the New Hampshire Lottery, said they anticipate selling more tickets on sequential or repetitive dates such as 12/12/12, but notes that lottery players get inspired by all sorts of things. In 2005, more than 100 winners of a secondary $100,000 Powerball prize played numbers linked back to the numbers in a single fortune cookie. 'Lottery players, kind of in a nutshell, are superstitious,' McCann said. The numbers mean less in Las Vegas sports betting books. In horse racing , it would mean an unusual number of horses would have to run to take a ticket on 12, 13, 14, said John Avello, the director of the race and sports operations at the Wynn hotel-casino. A roulette wheel stands to be the more likely destination for a gambler looking to chance it with the date, he said. For many others in Las Vegas, they will take a chance by making a date for a spouse. The Viva Las Vegas wedding chapel plans to marry 120 couples Saturday starting with Egyptian-themed nuptials followed by weddings with a touch of Tom Jones, gangsters, Liberace and, of course, Elvis, said general manager Brian Mills. The number is on pace with July 7, 2007 (7/7/7) but far from the 230 weddings the chapel performed for November 11, 2011 (11/11/11). Nevada's Clark County marriage license bureau issued its most 'numerically-interesting' certificates — 4,333 — in the four days leading up to July 7, 2007,  — more than half of what it typically issues in an entire month.. November 11, 2011 brought in 3,300 new marriage licenses. Oct. 10, 2010 was close behind with 3,090. Expectations at the agency were high for Saturday. Higher still, the 550-foot-tall High Roller observation wheel on the Las Vegas Strip had signed up about 80 couples so far for its free 12/13/14 ceremonies aboard the ride starting at 10:11 a.m. through 12:13 p.m. Among them, Brandi Carrow, 37, who just three weeks prior eloped in Reno at the Chapel of the Bells. This wedding is for her dad, Richard, who, wanting to see his daughter get married, convinced Carrow and her husband to do a re-do of sorts to renew their already fresh vows high above Las Vegas. 'We are so nervous,' said Carrow of the hub-bub of a wedding in front of the entire city, not to mention her father and step-mother. Oh, and Carrow is also 'scared to death of heights.' So which anniversary date will they celebrate? Both, she said. 'Who gets married and then gets to go to Vegas and get the chance to re-do it,' she said, let alone on 12/13/14.","Tomorrow is Saturday December 13 - a sequential 12/13/14 when written as numerals .

"A mother carefully touches up her daughter's lipstick and young Buddhist monks chat in the morning cold. These  candid photographs capture the buzz in the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu last weekend, as thousands of Tibetan refugees poured out into the streets to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Dalai Lama's Nobel Peace Prize. Nepal is home to more than 20,000 Tibetans - for many from as far back as 1959, when the 14th Dalai Lama, fled to India after a failed uprising against China. Images of last weekend's celebrations, which coincided with the 66th International Human Rights Day, show how the 79-year-old Tibetan spiritual leader continues to be a universal role model for both young and old.

Nepal ceased issuing refugee papers to Tibetans in 1989 and recognizes Tibet to be a part of China. Human Rights Watch report published in April says Nepal faces intense Chinese pressure to limit the flow of Tibetans crossing the border and restrictions have helped stem the number of those fleeing Tibet. Fewer than 200 Tibetans arrived in 2013, down from an annual average of 2,000 before 2008. Hundreds of refugees from Tibet trek for days across treacherous Himalayan mountain passes to reach Nepal every year, and then cross into India where they are given political asylum. Those captured by Nepali police are usually promptly handed to the U.N.'s refugee agency UNHCR. Earlier this year, the U.N. human rights agency urged Nepal to register Tibetans, saying the lack of documentation put refugees at risk.

"A wild shooting incident in Miami that saw 23 officers fire off 377 rounds killing two unarmed men is being investigated by the State Attorney's Office and the Miami Dade Police department. Adrian Montesano, 27, and Corsini Valdes, 50, died inside a car in a hail of bullets unleashed by South Florida cops early one morning last December. Montesano had earlier robbed a Walgreens at gunpoint and following that shot police officer Saul Rodriguez in a nearby trailer park. Deadly chase: Adrian Montesano, 27, died after 23 police opened fire on his vehicle . Bullet-riddled: The blue Volvo was trapped between a tree and a pole, and its occupants unarmed . CBS . reports that by 5am, every police officer in South Florida was looking . for Adrian Montesano, who had stolen the officer's patrol vehicle, . driven it to his grandmother's house and fled in her blue Volvo. The Volvo crashed in the backyard of a townhouse on 65th Street just off 27th Avenue, wedged between a light pole and a tree. By this point, CBS reports, neither Montesano nor Valdes was armed. Witnesses say less than a minute passed before officers opened fire, sending more than 50 bullets into the vehicle. Horrifying: Police say this surveillance camera image shows Adrian Montesano, 27, after he took a hostage during a botched drug store robbery . 'And the guy tried to put his hands up. And as soon as he put his hands up, it erupted again. And that was it for them. That guy tried his best to give up.' During the second volley of shots, both Montsano and Valdes, who was innocent of any crime, died as bullets tore through their bodies. Montesano and Valdes weren't the only ones struck by the huge volume of bullets. Two officers were hit in the crossfire, one officer shot in the arm, and the other hit in the arm and grazed on the head, an injury that could have proved fatal had it been half an inch to the right. Two others sustained ruptured eardrums from the deafening blasts. Residents were fortunate not to have hit shot in the unrestrained shooting. 'It . was like the Wild Wild West, man, crazy,' Vandiver, who barely made it . through the back door of his home before the gunfire erupted, told CBS. Endangered: Witnesses say the officers fired wildly, with no concern for nearby residents . Damage: Townhouses, businesses, cars and fences were damaged by the gunfire . 'Shooting . just wild; shooting all over the place. Bullets could have come through . the window. Anything could have happened man. They weren’t thinking, . they weren’t thinking at all.' CBS . reports that the indiscriminate shooting indicates that officers lost . sight of their own training and failed to listen to their radios or . coordinate their actions, which endangered the public as well as . themselves. Holes were blasted into a townhouse where a 12-year-old dove for over and a four-month-old baby slept in a crib. Another neighbor said officers were laughing as they pulled the bullet-riddled bodies of Montesano and Valdes from the Volvo. 'The policemen that had on the black and white vests were out there laughing like it was so funny,' the neighbor told CBS. 'Because they got a free shot off them people. Shooting all them bullets like that, that don’t make no sense.' The mayhem began at 3.30am Tuesday when Adrian Montesano tried to rob a . Walgreens in Little Havana and the crime went horribly wrong. Police . say he took a hostage in an attempt to get what he wanted. Innocent victim: It's unclear how Corsini Valdes came to be in the vehicle with Montesano . Police . released a surveillance camera image showing 27-year-old Montesano with . his arm around a female hostage's throat while he points a . semiautomatic pistol at her head. She was later released unharmed. Witnesses said Montesano was driving . pickup truck for his heating and air conditioning business that was . emblazoned with his own name. A man who arrived at the crime scene and identified himself as Montesano's friend told the Miami Herald that Montesano robbed the pharmacy to support his drug addiction. He said that Montesano had been an upstanding citizen before he 'fell in with the wrong crowd.' About 5am, Miami Officer Saul Rodriguez spotted Montesano's truck at a trailer park about two miles from the robbery scene. When the 13-year police veteran approached the vehicle, Montesano shot him in the stomach. The fugitive then took the officer's pistol and sped off in his squad car. WSNV-TV reports that Rodriguez could be heard gasping for breath as he radioed in a description of the man who shot him. 'White male. Red shirt. Gray pants. Officer down.' That . set off a frantic manhunt across the city. Half an hour later, the . squad car was spotted near  the home of a family member of Montesano. Officers spotted him in his grandmother's blue Volvo, which witnesses later said he had taken from her home. A . police pursuit ensued and Montesano, who was driving with Corsini . Valdes, crashed. It's not clear how or why Valdes was in the car. Witnesses say Montesano used his company pickup truck - which has his own name plastered all over it - as a getaway vehicle after the robbery . A body of one of the suspects can be seen at the scene of the police shootout where both men were killed by officers . Initial reports stated that the pair opened fire, but CBS later revealed that neither was armed. Police fired on the Volvo and riddled the car with bullets. One of the men died at the scene. The other was mortally wounded and died at the hospital shortly after the gun battle. Three . other officers were hospitalized with minor injuries from the gunfight, . including an officer who was hit by flying glass. All officers, including Officer Rodriguez, made full recoveries from their injuries. Montesano had only one previous run-in with police, when he was arrested in 2007 for trespassing after he drove through a fence into a beach, the Herald reports. Officers found him trying to use beach signs to get his truck unstuck from the sand. When police approached him, he swore at them and claimed he a member of his family was a police officer. The mayhem snarled traffic across the city throughout the morning commute as detectives worked to examine the multiple crime scenes and collect evidence.","The Florida State Attorney's Office and the Miami Dade Police department is investigating a shooting incident that left two men dead .

"The Uber executive who suggested hiring researchers to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize his company has fallen into a bitter row with his landlord over his $9,500-a-month apartment in San Francisco, it has been revealed. Emil Michael, who is senior vice president for business at the taxi firm, accused tech industry lawyer John Danforth of harassment,  and racism claiming the tech industry lawyer 'violated [his] human rights' by performing unnecessary renovations to the flat. He became so aggrieved by the landlords alleged intrusions that he even took his complaint to San Francisco's Superior Court and applied for a restraining order - one usually reserved for stalkers and abusive partners. Scroll down for video . Aggrieved: Emil Michael (pictured) became so aggrieved by the landlords alleged intrusions that he even took his complaint to San Francisco's Superior Court and applied for a restraining order - one usually reserved for stalkers and abusive partners . 'I am under constant emotional duress that a stranger can enter my apartment without notice requiring me to defend myself posing constant fear and a dangerous situation,' Michael wrote, according to court papers seen by BuzzFeed News. He added: 'Also, the landlord is invading my privacy and ruining my relationship with my significant other.' Danforth responded by branding Michael's claims 'demonstrably false' before the judge threw the case out of court. According to BuzzFeed, the dispute between Michael and his landlord centers on a '2,000 square foot Pacific Heights condo overlooking Alta Plaza Park, for which Michael signed a $9,500 lease in June 2012 (the rent has since been raised to $13,335).' The website goes on: 'The three bedroom, two bathroom condo was renovated in 2008 and boasts luxury finishes, a parking space, a balcony, and access to a landscaped private garden complete with a remote-control hot tub.' The dispute allegedly began in June last year when Danforth entered the property to repair a bathroom and discovered his tenant had painter a wall without permission. When he then went onto the balcony to inspect repairs made to the hot tub. High flyer: Michael is taxi firm Uber's senior vice president . Two months later, Michael confronted a female gardener with a baseball bat in the belief she was an intruder, before writing an email to Danforth stating: 'You provided no notice for this…If this happens again, I will be forced to call the police.' He later threatened to reveal Danforth's perceived transgressions to his 'tens of thousands of social media followers'. On September 27 2013 the two men met face to face in court in a hearing overseen by judge, Donald J. Sullivan. Michael said he had suffered 'immense stress', adding: 'I am entitled to the sanctity of my own home.' Danforth responded by denying that anybody had regularly entered the apartment and that Michael had lied under oath. The judge dismissed the case with prejudice. 'Having listened to all of the evidence, I'm finding that this is a borderline frivolous case,' he said, according to the court transcript. 'It doesn't even come close to meeting the statutory standards of by clear and convincing evidence.' It did not end there. A furious email exchange ensued. 'Parts of their correspondence were available in public documents filed with the superior court and rent board,' said BuzzFeed, 'while others were provided to BuzzFeed News by Danforth.' In one, Michael wrote: 'I am so glad that you denied that I have sole and exclusive use of the property. It is your typical harassment, retaliation, racist activity that you use with me.' He also threatened to have him arrested after taking the matter to 'my friend the Chief of Police of SF'. A spokesperson for the SFPD said in an email that the 'chief himself will not be getting involved in any civil disputes or civil investigation.' In March Michael sent Danforth an email saying: 'I was hoping you were not still dealing with your mental health issues. But, I guess given that you are a patent troll and a slumlord, you cannot help yourself.' Target: It comes after he reportedly proposed looking into journalists' 'personal lives' and 'families' while at a private dinner in New York He was speaking with specific reference to Sarah Lacy (left), editor of PandoDaily, who recently wrote about deleting her Uber app (right) after the firm teamed up with an apparent escort service in France . Danforth responded by suggesting Michael should start looking for a new apartment, to which Michael replied: 'I can stay in the apartment as long as I want, a*****e. Regardless, this is good evidence of your intent, racist a*****e.' The acerbic email exchanges came after Michael was forced into a grovelling apology last month for suggesting a plan to spend $1million on a team of researchers to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize his company. Michael, who made the remarks at a private dinner in Manhattan, said he had dreamed up an eight-man team who would find out about writers' personal lives and families so that Uber could discredit them. The sinister scheme was targeted at a particular Silicon Valley female editor who has savaged the company for its alleged 'sexism and misogyny' - but drew an outraged backlash when it became public. A chorus of disapproval aimed at Michael prompted a humiliating public apology to Sarah Lacy, the editor of PandoDaily, in which he disowned the idea entirely. Michael posted an apology to Lacy's Twitter account, saying: 'I would like to apologize to you directly. My comments were wrong and I deeply regret them. 'Neither me [sic] nor my company would ever engage in such activities. Again, I apologize.' The remarks will do little to improve Uber's fragile relationship with the media following the portrayal of its management team as insensitive and aggressive toward customer complaints. Venue: During the dinner party at Manhattan's Waverly Inn (pictured), Michael was reportedly asked about the firm's depictions in the press. In response, the executive suggested that Uber should consider spending 'a million dollars' of its reported $15billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists, it is claimed . And, indeed, the apology did not stop Lacy from writing a scathing opinion piece on PandoDaily, in which she said the plan was 'like a five-year-old pretending to be Frank Underwood' - a reference to Kevin Spacey's scheming politician character in Netflix series House of Cards. According to Lacy, Michael also called her cell phone and ask to speak in private, but hung up after she refused to have an off-the-record conversation. The dinner party in question was hosted by Ian Osborne, ex-adviser to British Prime Minister David Cameron and consultant for Uber . Michael's plan came up when he was asked about the firm's negative press coverage. Apology: Michael, who used to work at Klout and also sits on a board advising the Department of Defense, later took to Twitter to apologize for his comments to Lacy herself, saying: 'I would like to apologize to you directly' In response, the executive suggested that Uber should consider spending 'a million dollars' of its reported $15billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists, according to BuzzFeed. The eight-strong hit team would investigate 'your personal lives, your families' with a view to discrediting journalists behind unfavorable reports on the taxi service, he said. Michael was especially focused on Lacy, who also recently accused Uber of 'sexism and misogyny' on her Silicon Valley website, writing: 'The company simply doesn't respect us or prioritize our safety.' He reportedly expressed anger over her claims that, responding that women are far more likely to suffer assault at the hands of normal taxi drivers than Uber drivers. He said Lacy should be held 'personally responsible' for any women who copy her and delete the taxi app, and are then sexually assaulted, it is reported . Contradicting his remarks: He added: 'Neither me nor my company would ever engage in such activities' And in reference to a specific claim about Lacy's personal life, he said Uber's dirt-diggers could work covertly to expose and discredit her to others, adding: 'Nobody would know it was us.' After being confronted about his comments, Michael, who has been at Uber for more than a year and was previously described as a 'top deal guy' by founder Travis Kalanick, later apologized . In a statement to BuzzFeed on Monday evening, he said he believed he was speaking off the record and that his remarks did not reflect his nor Uber's views. 'The remarks attributed to me at a private dinner - borne out of frustration during an informal debate over what I feel is sensationalistic media coverage of the company I am proud to work for - do not reflect my actual views and have no relation to the company's views or approach,' he said. 'They were wrong no matter the circumstance and I regret them.' At no point during the dinner did Michael suggest the firm has already hired opposition researchers. An Uber spokesman confirmed that the company does not carry out such research and has never considered doing it because it would be a 'clear violation of our privacy and data access policies'. The event at Waverly Inn was attended by a number of high-profile figures, including actor Ed Norton and publisher Arianna Huffington.","Emil Michael, Uber senior VP, got into row with John Danforth last year .

"Abbie Stocker, 25, has claimed she was told to stop breastfeeding her newborn son in a hospital waiting room by a nurse . A new mother claims she was asked by a nurse to move to a private room while breastfeeding her son in a hospital waiting room. Abbie Stocker, 25, said she was left feeling ‘humiliated’ and ‘like a naughty schoolgirl’ as she sat breastfeeding ten-week-old Eric. Mrs Stocker politely declined to leave. But after her son’s appointment with an eye consultant, she says she was forced to finish feeding her baby in a corridor. The case comes at a time of national debate about breastfeeding in public after controversy over Lou Burns, who was told to cover herself and her baby with a napkin in Claridge’s, the exclusive Mayfair hotel. Recalling the latest incident at Burnley Hospital, Mrs Stocker said: ‘There were about five other people in the waiting room with children and none of them seemed concerned. ‘It was clear that the staff were not happy with me breastfeeding in public. I was only offered the chance to return to the waiting room once Eric had finished his feed. ‘I felt humiliated, like a naughty schoolgirl who had been made to wait outside the headteacher’s office.’ Last week Ukip leader Nigel Farage stirred the controversy when he suggested mothers should be willing to ‘sit in the corner’ in restaurants when breastfeeding. His comments in response to the incident at Claridge’s came under attack, with David Cameron saying it was ‘totally unacceptable’ to make mothers feel uncomfortable. Scroll down for video . Mrs Stocker said she was  made to finish feeding 10-week-old Eric in an empty corridor at Burnley General Hospital (pictured) Louise Burns complained that she was asked to place a large napkin over her baby's head in the restaurant at Claridge's in London as she breastfed . Women staged a public breastfeed outside the London hotel last week in protest at women being told to cover up. The new Equality Act states that it amounts to sex discrimination to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding. The law applies to anyone providing services, facilities and premises to the public, public bodies,further and higher education bodies and association. Women are protected  in public places such as parks, sports and leisure facilities, public buildings and when using public transport such as buses, trains and planes. They are protected in shops, pubs, restaurants and hotels regardless of how big or small. The law also applies in hospitals, theatres, cinemas and petrol stations. Mrs Stocker, who is still breastfeeding her two-year-old daughter Millie, pointed out that the Equality Act states it is illegal to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place. She added: ‘This is not the first time I have experienced discrimination like this but to face it in a hospital that prides itself on promoting breastfeeding is unbelievable. ‘Breastfeeding reduces the mother’s risk of contracting ovarian and breast cancer and it also helps to protect the child from illnesses such as asthma and cancer. ‘I hope this will not discourage other mums because it is one of the best things you can do for your child.’ Last night the hospital said it welcomed breastfeeding mothers in all departments. Anita Fleming, head of midwifery at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: ‘It’s disappointing to hear that our offer of a room to allow Mrs Stocker privacy and comfort was misinterpreted on this occasion and we are sorry for any upset.’ A group of mothers  staged a mass breastfeed outside Claridge's after Louise Burns was ordered to cover up .","Abbie Stocker was breastfeeding in Burnley General Hospital, Lancashire .

"The father of  Australian jihadist Amira Karroum, who was killed in January after joining her radicalised husband and al-Qaeda fighters in  Syria, says he plans to sue the Australian government for his 'angel's' death. During an explosive interview with Channel Nine's A Current Affair program on Friday, Mohamed Karroum says he blames Australian authorities for his daughter's death because they allowed radical Islamic recruiters into the country and they 'allowed her to leave'. In one shocking comment, an angry Mr Karroum tells journalist Lisa Goddard: . 'I'm praying to the Lord every day, Tony Abbott, please Lord, let him lose one of his daughter, either in sickness or in accident or something, please Lord.' Scroll down for video . Amira Karroum (pictured) was killed in January after joining her radicalised husband and al-Qaeda fighters in Syria . Educated at an Anglican private school in Queensland, Amira Karroum became a devout Muslim, donning the hijab, after moving to Sydney with her sister in 2011 . In an interview on Channel Nine's A Current Affair program, a grieving Mohamed Karroum says the Australian government has his daughter's blood on its hands . Prime Minister Tony Abbott (middle) with his two daughters Frances (left) and Bridget (right) 'The Australian government is the mother and father of her, they are the ones who control everything in this country,' Mr Karroum told A Current Affair. 'I want to take the federal government to court; they are responsible for the death of my daughter.' Amira, 22, described by her father as a 'beautiful girl' who loved barbecues and dancing with her friends, was in war-torn Syria with her new  husband Tyler Perry, also known as Yusef Ali. The pair met and married in 2013, before Ali travelled to fight with al-Qaeda in Syria. After the Australian government stopped Amira from trying to leave the country on two occasions, she told family she was going to meet Ali for a vacation in Copenhagen. Her body was found shot and dismembered beside her husband's   in a house in Aleppo, just three weeks after she left Australia. Mohammed Karroum recalled the last message his daughter sent him shortly before her death. 'Please Dad, pray to Allah and ask him to forgive you for the days, for the years you have not prayed for him, death is around the corner Dad. I love you,' he recalled. He says he 'just can't believe' his daughter became an al-Qaeda fighter. Mohamed Karroum says Yusef Ali, a known extremist, 'poisoned' his daughter's mind . One of the posts from Amira's Facebook page, where she said she worked as a 'Slave of Allah'. Mohamed Karroum believes Ali was a trained al-Qaeda killer who was known to Australian authorities. 'I believe she was sacrificed because they were trying to take somebody to court, and they knew she would lead them to him,' he said. 'The Australian Federal Police and ASIO are not doing their job, this is the fact.' He is now looking for a lawyer to help him take the federal government to court. 'I want an apology, that's number one, for killing my daughter.'","The father of Amira Karroum, killed in Syria after joining islamic extremists, says he will sue the Australian government for his daughter's death .

"A former army corporal received a royal salute from Prince Charles today as he continued his 11,000 mile mobility scooter journey around the UK in aide of his former comrades. Mark Newton, who suffered a life changing injury to his leg in 1991 whilst attached to the United Nations in Cyprus, passed the prince while he inspected the troops before sending them on their way to march through Swansea. The Prince of Wales holds the honorary role of Colonel-in-Chief with the 1st Queens Dragoons Guards who Mr Newton used to serve for, and who part funded his scooter. Former army corporal Mark Newton received a royal salute from Prince Charles in Swansea today as he continued on his 11,000 mile mobility scooter journey around the UK to raise money for his former comrades. The Prince of Wales holds the honorary role of Colonel-in-Chief with the 1st Queens Dragoons Guards who Mr Newton used to serve for, and who part funded his scooter . Mr Newton's UK tour is his second fundraising trip. After being made redundant in 2010, he drove 1,450 miles around Wales in 2011, raising just under £9,000 for his former unit, Help for Heroes and The Royal British Legion. The 48-year-old from Loughor, began his latest trip, along with his two cats Missy and Smudge, from Scotland in April last year. According to a fundraising page, he has so far raised over £39,000. In August he spoke to Wales Online and was reportedly on day 494 of his trip. It is not known how Mr Newton's trip will take, but his scooter has a top speed of eight miles an hour, so if he travelled at its top speed for eight hours a day for a week, he would cover just under 450 miles. His 1,452 mile trip in 2011, took 52 days. The prince's appearance in Swansea was one of two engagements he was involved in during a pre-Christmas tour of the principality - which also saw him reopen the refurbished Memorial Hall in Newbridge, Caerphilly. Dozens of military personnel marched in time to the Royal Armoured Corps band - exercising their right to Freedom of the City - as Charles saluted them. QDG General Sir Simon Mayall said the event was special for the regiment - who have completed three tours in both Afghanistan and Iraq - as well as Wales. He said: 'We were given the freedom of Swansea in 2009 and this the second time we have exercised that right. The prince inspects the troops before sending them on their way to march through Swansea . QDG General Sir Simon Mayall said the event was special for the regiment - who have completed three tours in both Afghanistan and Iraq - as well as Wales . 'The Queens Dragoons Guards have long had strong links with Wales - hence our nickname as the Welsh Cavalry. 'So to carry out the march, with our Colonel-in-Chief the Prince of Wales watching is truly special.' The Prince was only in Wales some six months ago for his annual 'summer holiday' in Wales - which sees the Prince and the Duchess of Cornwall stay at their 192 acre Llwynywermod estate near Llandovery, as well undertaking a series of engagements across the country. But despite making regular visits, the crowds still turned out in force. Around 100 people braved exceptionally chilly temperatures and blustery winds to welcome the Prince to Newbridge Memorial Hall for his first engagement. The Prince's visit to the hall was been described as the icing on the cake by local officials following its lengthy restoration. The Grade II listed building, built in 1908, has been brought back into use thanks to the efforts of fundraisers with original decorations restored and its major rooms retaining their original uses. As he walked down the street towards the hall youngsters from Pentremawr Primary School serenaded Charles with Christmas carols while waving Welsh and Union flags. After chatting to several youngsters and wishing them a Merry Christmas, Charles also drew big smiles while chatting to members of a local toddler group. The Prince of Wales also visited The Newbridge Memorial Hall in South Wales to officially open the refurbished building; above he meets a member of the pre school club . After looking at Roy Guy's painting commemorating the 1878 Abercarn mining disaster, which killed 268, the prince was treated to more music from the talents of Newbridge & District Ladies Choir. As well as watching ballroom dancers strut their stuff, Charles watched a specially written comedy sketch - aptly called Waiting For Charles. Later he addressed a packed 400-seater auditorium, before unveiling a memorial plaque, commemorating the lives of miners. Charles said: 'Of course I said I must come back to see this special building transformed once again, especially at the time of the centenary of the First World War - a most suitable moment. 'I know how challenging these projects can be so I want to take this opportunity to congratulate all those people who took part to get this splendid building back up again. 'I do hope this place will bring new life and inspiration to Newbridge.' Howard Stone, chair of the Newbridge Institute & Memorial Hall, said it was an incredible day for everyone connected with the venue. He added: 'We have fought long and hard for this and to share the celebrations with Prince Charles and our 400 guests is the perfect way to mark this wonderful occasion.' Charles hopped aboard the Royal train at Pontypool and headed westward bound to Swansea. And it was especially fitting the Prince's next engagement was at The Guildhall - a building opened by King George VI and the place where Charles himself signed the official papers to turn Swansea from a town into a city.","Mark Newton suffered a life changing injury to his leg in 1991 .

"A Palestinian man was shot by a passing civilian after he attacked an Israeli family who were picking up a hitch-hiker near Jerusalem. The attacker threw a 'chemical substance' at the father, four young children, and another man - before chasing them with a screwdriver, the Israel Defence Forces have said. A civilian who was driving past at the time, stopped his car and opened fire at the assailant. He shot him twice in the legs before the authorities arrested him near a checkpoint south of Jerusalem in the occupied West Bank. The severity of his injuries are unclear and no groups have claimed responsibility for the attack. Scroll down for video . Sudden attack: These are the items left behind by the four girls in the car, when a Palestinian man attacked them, and their father, with acid . Response:  Doctors rushed to the scene to treat the victims of the attack, which included four young children . Terror: The Israel Defence Force took to Twitter to announce the attacker had been shot by a passing civilian . Injured: Israeli soldiers stand guard as one of the young girls injured during the acid attack is taken to hospital . Ambushed: An Israeli family were about to pick up a hitch-hiker (in the car pictured) when a 'mentally unstable' Palestinian man attacked them . Watchful eye: An ultra-orthodox Jewish man patrols the scene in the aftermath of an acid attack on an Israeli family by a Palestinian man . The Israeli family were taken to a nearby hospital after suffering 'light wounds'. Palestinians residents at the scene named the attacker as Jamal Ghayyada, 46, from the nearby village of Nahalin. They claim he was mentally unstable and had previously received treatment at a mental health clinic in Bethlehem. They added that he had been arrested before. The Israeli Army said in a statement: 'A vehicle carrying a family with four girls picked up a hitchhiker near a checkpoint outside Bethlehem, and close to the Gush Etzion settlement area. 'The hitchhiker threw acid on the passengers, injuring them lightly.' This latest incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between the two nations - following the death of a Palestinian official during a confrontation with Israeli troops on Wednesday. Ziad Abu Ain died shortly after an Israeli soldier grabbed him by the neck in a scuffle, and hit him in the chest with the butt of his rifle. An Israel official who attended the autopsy said the minister had died of a heart attack, possibly brought on by stress, while a Palestinian pathologist concluded the grab to his neck lead to heart failure. The Palestinian leadership blamed Israel for his death and threatened retaliation, amid speculation they would suspend security coordination with Israel in the West Bank. US Secretary of State, John Kerry, is to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Rome Sunday as part of efforts to defuse the fall-out caused by the death. Crime scene: The car in which the victims were riding in (pictured) was cordoned off while Israeli forces inspected it . Violence: At least 10 Israeli's and one foreigner have been killed by Palestinians in knife or car-based attacks in the last four months . Retracted: The Israeli military originally said the attack was carried out by the hitch-hiker but later rescinded that statement . Anger: The acid attack comes two days after a Palestinian official, Ziad Abu Ain (pictured), died shortly after an Israeli soldier hit him in the chest with a rifle butt . Over the past four months, 10 Israelis and one foreign visitor have been killed by Palestinians in knife or car-based attacks. Meanwhile at least a dozen Palestinians have also been killed, including most of those who carried out the killings. The burning alive of a Palestinian in July - a revenge attack for the murder of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank - sparked months of unrest which led to a bloody 50-day war in the Gaza Strip between Israel and Hamas. Israel blamed Hamas for the Israeli murders, and rounded up hundreds of its members in the West Bank.","Incident occurred south of Jerusalem in the occupied West Bank territory .

Chanda Campbell came across her son Emmett carrying out the DIY haircut when she heard laughing coming from the bathroom at the family's home in Saskatchewan, Canada . 'Tell the camera what you're doing,' she says to Emmett. 'I'm combing my hair,' the little boy replies, giggling. Chanda starts laughing as she responds: 'Doesn't look like you're combing it, it looks like you're shaving it there bud. 'I don't think you're going to be able to comb it for a while there dude.' 'Looks good, I like it,' she adds, as Emmett displays his half-shaved head to the camera, before telling him he's done 'a fantastic job'.

"Former suspect Robert Murat was questioned for more than four hours today at an Algarve police station over the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. The IT consultant, 41, was driven away from Faro Police Station late lunchtime along with his lawyer Francisco Pagarete after answering questions as a witness. It was the second time in three days he had attended the station. Quizzed: Robert Murat pictured outside the Faro Police Station on Friday . Police were due to quiz the British expat on Wednesday but ran out of time after interviewing his German-born wife Michaela Walczuch, 38, as a witness. He was the last of ten men and women - four Brits, a German and five Portuguese nationals - quizzed as witnesses this week on the Algarve at Scotland Yard’s request. A British woman described as the wife of one of the Portuguese witnesses is also understood to have been questioned in the UK. There was no immediate word on what Mr Murat had been asked or replied. The interviews were conducted behind closed doors and Mr Pagarete declined to comment. Michaela did not return to the police station with her husband today. There was no sign either of Operation Grange boss Andy Redwood or DCI Nicola Wall, who is due to take charge of the British police probe into Madeleine’s disappearance when he retires later this month. The police quiz of Mr Murat, made a formal suspect or arguido days after Madeleine went missing on May 3 2007 before being cleared a year later, had been expected to last until much later in the day. Taking the reins: DCI Nicola Wall walked into Faro Police Station with outgoing Operation Grange boss Andy Redwood just before 9.30am for the start of the third day of interviews with nearly a dozen witnesses . British police believe Madeleine (pictured) was killed during a bungled burglary, a theory their Portuguese counterparts who are conducting their own parallel investigation into Madeleine's disappearance have privately rubbished . Mr Murat, who is not suspected of any involvement in Madeleine's disappearance, said last month when it emerged he was facing questioning that he was happy to cooperate. Speaking before he received his official notification, he said: 'My conscience is clear and I have no problem speaking to police again.' Michaela, Mr Murat's girlfriend when Madeleine vanished, was questioned three times as a witness after the youngster's disappearance. A Portuguese lorry driver later came forward to say he had seen a blonde woman he said resembled estate agent Michaela passing a blanket containing a child to a man on an Algarve farm the day after Madeleine vanished. A Spanish woman also claimed she had spotted her in a town in northern Morocco in June 2007, moments after she had seen a girl who looked just like Madeleine. Michaela, whose home was searched by Portuguese police after Madeleine disappeared, complained of being treated like dirt by detectives and claimed Kate and Gerry McCann's former detective agency Metodo 3 had cynically used her. Protesting her innocence in a December 2007 interview with a UK newspaper, she said: 'I lost my faith not just in justice but in the whole system and everyone that supports it. Vanished: Madeleine McCann was three years old when she disappeared from her holiday resort in Praia da Luz (pictured) in May 2007 . 'The worst part is people putting me in this, knowing I have nothing to do with it. 'They have no feelings, no heart. They are completely empty. 'When Robert called me to tell me that there was a story about these sightings I went into town and I just saw my face on the front of all the papers. I felt sick. 'I just wanted to scream 'I didn't do it'. The police quizzes taking place this week are the first since four men were questioned as arguidos at the start of July. All four - who included Russian businessman Sergey Malinka and a schizophrenic heroin addict - insisted they had nothing to do with Madeleine McCann's disappearance. British police believe Madeleine was killed during a bungled burglary, a theory their Portuguese counterparts who are conducting their own parallel investigation into Madeleine's disappearance have privately rubbished. Parts of the Praia da Luz resort where the youngster vanished were dug up in June at Scotland Yard's request in a grim search for her body - but failed to yield any clues.","IT consultant was driven into Faro Police Station through a back entrance .

"It promised a ‘fully immersive’ Christmas experience, with reindeer, a festive market and, of course, Santa’s grotto. But visitors to Yorkshire’s Magical Winterland found it to be far from magical and barely wintry. Children were left in tears as they entered a desolate warehouse with cardboard boxes and random material strewn all over the ground. Scroll down for video . Yorkshire's 'Magical Winterland' was closed less than 24 after opening following a barrage of complaints from parents about the rubbish-strewn hallways and shabby exhibitions . Families were promised a chance to feed the reindeer, who were found to be in a dirty enclosure surrounded by a sprinkling of straw . Parents complained about the creepy-looked mannequins and statues of an ice queen (left) and one which looked like an attempt at the Grinch . And parents who were promised a ‘fully immersive’ Christmas experience for £20 a ticket were left distinctly unimpressed at being charged for extras – including £10 for a photograph with Santa. Many were unhappy that the ‘grumpy looking’ Santa did not even stay until closing time. Others complained about the conditions that two reindeer were kept in. Also among the litany of complaints were claims that the Christmas market only contained four stalls – while concerns were dismissed by rude staff. Mother-of-two Leanne Potter said: ‘It was truly awful. The event was clearly just planned to make as much money as possible. They weren’t bothered about the quality of the event.’ The organisers of the event at the Great Yorkshire Showground, in Harrogate, were forced to close the event after only 24 hours after visitors said they were ‘appalled’ by the experience. It comes less than a month after a winter attraction designed by TV presenter Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen was closed after just a day. Families were left stumped by many of the exhibitions in the winter walk, saying it was unclear what the scenes were supposed to represent . Yorkshire's Magical Winterland said the event had 'fantastic features', but many of the decorations were found to be dirty and deflated . There was a three-hour wait to visit Santa, who was guarded by another pair of elves who were reportedly Incapable of answering basic questions about the event . The halls at the Yorkshire Event Centre were empty and families said the fairground rides were overpriced and there were only four stalls . The ‘Magical Journey’ at the Belfry Golf Club in Warwickshire attracted more than 1,000 complaints about rude staff, a sweary Father Christmas and elves that ‘sat around smoking’. The Magical Winterland reopened yesterday, with the promise it would be ‘better than ever’. However, parents and children were still underwhelmed. Some attempts to improve it had been made – enthusiastic elves who encouraged children to throw paper snowballs, and there was an increase in decorations and fairy lights. However, further inside, the attraction appeared to be the same sorry situation described by the parents who walked out in disgust on its first day – including a three-hour wait to see Santa. Suzie Smith, 32, from Barnsley, who brought her two-year-old daughter Heidi to the attraction, said: ‘I thought we would give it a chance and come and make my own mind up but it’s really very, very poor. ‘I had a vision in my head of a really magical place for kids to come before Christmas but to be honest it’s just a bit depressing.’ The festive nine hole golf course promised 'twinkling Christmas lights, fantastic gifts to overcome and even Santa Claus himself' Richard and Danielle Taylor, both 34, who brought their two-year-old son Jacob said they would be asking for a refund following their visit . Parents complained that as soon as they walked through the doors into the 'desolate' space they were hounded to pay for 'extras' Suzie Smith, 32, (left) who brought her two-year-old daughter Heidi and her friend Alex Bowler, also two, described the attraction as 'depressing'. Becky Numm, 31, (right) and her daughter Eliza said they would not be coming back . THE MAGICAL JOURNEY - BIRMINGHAM . The 'Magical Journey' winter wonderland designed by Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen closed after just one day – after rude staff, a sweary Father Christmas and elves that 'sat around smoking' left children in tears. More than a thousand parents complained about the experience at the Belfry Golf Club in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, last month which costs upwards of £50 for a family of three. The attraction was deemed 'tacky' and 'unsafe' by families, but it was re-opened after three days of design improvements. The 'Magical Journey' winter wonderland in Birmingham, designed by Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, closed after just one day last month . WINTER WONDERLAND - RUISLIP . The Ruislip Winter Wonderland in north London was cancelled two days before it was due to open earlier this week. Former I'm a Celebrity star and singer David Van Day and wife Sue Moxley were earmarked for the 'star-studded' opening performance. The announcement has left hundreds of families and children disappointed. WINTER WONDERLAND - MILTON KEYNES . A winter wonderland event in Milton Keynes was cancelled on its second day in December last year after complaints from visitors. Families had paid up to £65 in advance for various attractions at the town's Campbell Park, including meeting Santa, ice skating and seeing huskies and reindeer. But its Facebook page was deluged by people angry at what was on offer. Santa's Grotto was said to be staffed by young, thin men and an ice rink was described as 'a few plastic sheets'. LAPLAND NEW FOREST - DORSET . Two brothers were  jailed for misleading thousands of customers at a Lapland-themed park on the Hampshire and Dorset border. Victor Mears, 67, and Henry Mears, 60, ran the Lapland New Forest attraction in 2008 but it closed within days after hundreds of complaints. In February 2011 they were found guilty of eight charges of misleading the public.

"A major water company has to spend £7 million every year clearing sewers which have been blocked by foreign objects accidentally flushed down the toilet. Among the detritus recovered from Anglian Water's sewers are toys, mobile phones and even some false teeth. Such is the extent of the problem, that workers are removing on average one tonne of waste a day. Much of the rubbish, such as disposable wipes, needs to be removed by hand and then compacted. Emma Staple, spokeswoman for Anglian Water Services, said: “All that should go down is poo, pee and paper. 'The main problem by a long stretch is disposable wipes which people put down the toilet instead of in the bin. It costs around £7 million to clear all these things out of the sewage network. 'That does reflect in customers’ bills and it’s money that would be better spent elsewhere.' Dentists advise that the owners of false teeth should ensure they are cleaned regularly, but not in the bowl of the toilet where they may escape . Also, very few people are that desperate to talk that they want to listen to the other person while they are ensconced on the throne . While it is true that certain public toilets require a small coin to proceed, users should be careful with where they leave their flexible friend . When applying Vaseline, it is best practice to move away from the toilet bowl in case the lubricant qualities of the product cause it to slip . While it might say 'Eau de Toilette' on the bottle, you should not attempt to refill the container from the bowl as it is not the same liquid . Toilet duck may be a popular brand of cleaning product but this frog was rescued from one of Anglian Water's sewers by an engineer . Toy animals should not be flushed down the toilet under any circumstances as it is incredibly cruel and uncaring . Not even superheroes are safe from taking the porcelain plunge into the nation's sewerage system, blocking up the pipes . Among the items regularly recovered from the nation's sewers are golf balls and wallets, which is an interesting combination . Despite the decline in popularity of hair curlers since the 1950s they should be only disposed in an environmentally sustainable manner .","Engineers from Anglian Water remove one tonne of foreign objects a day from their network's underground sewers .

"The grieving family of Sam Trott say they have forgiven the tradesmen who left their front door open through which the tragic toddler wandered out of and later drowned in a nearby lake. The two year old's body was found in Landsdale Lake near Perth by divers and emergency workers on Wednesday morning after a massive search involving hundreds of local people. The two Glass 100 company tradesmen who were at the Trott family home at the time when Sam went missing were welcomed back to the family’s house on Thursday during an emotional meeting which lasted several hours. Scroll down for video . Two-year-old Sam Trott has been missing since 10.30am on Tuesday when he wandered out of his front door at Lansdale in Perth . Perth Now reported how Glass 100 spokesman Mark Lynch - who has known Sam's father Matthew for 15 years - paid tribute to Sam’s parents for their compassion and support. 'Lyndal and Matt have been amazing throughout this terrible ordeal,' Mr Lynch said. “The tradesmen that were on site were welcomed back to the family home yesterday (Thursday). They spent most of the afternoon there. 'I spent most of Tuesday and Wednesday with Matt and Lyndal … they were asking me every couple of hours, how our guys were going. 'Even at a time of immense personal tragedy, they were still looking out for other people.' A Carols by Candlelight event went ahead as scheduled at Warradale Park on Friday nightattended by the toddler’s family and hundreds of other well-wishers and mourners. The Trott family were at the carols event to pay  to the community that gave them so much support during their nightmare ordeal. They had insisted that the carols night not be cancelled because they didn’t want to 'deprive other children of the joy Sam would have experienced'. Two-year-old Sam Trott pictured here with his mother Lyndal and father Matthew Trott . The grandfather of a missing two-year-old autistic boy described him as a 'happy, affectionate and loving' boy. Speaking on behalf of Sam's parents Matthew and Lyndal, Geoff Trott said the family were 'devastated' and are still coming to terms with the tragedy. 'Sam was very dear to us all and his premature passing is a tragedy we're still struggling to deal with,' Mr Trott said. 'He was a happy, affectionate and loving child, with an infectious smile and brought so much sunshine into our lives.' 'Sam could not have been blessed with more devoted parents than Matt and Lyndel, who have loved him unconditionally since the day he was born.' Mr Trott said Sam's parents had strived to give him a better life since he was diagnosed with Autism. 'They've been unrelenting in their goal to create every opportunity for him to thrive and fulfil his potential,' Mr Trott said. He thanked the police, SES and all the volunteers who helped in the search for Sam. Mr Trott also mentioned how lucky they were to be part of such a 'wonderful community'. He said they were overwhelmed by the compassion shown by the community and the outpouring of grief. Divers and emergency workers were searching Landsdale Lake near Perth on Wednesday morning when they discovered a body in the search for Sam Trott . 'We'd like to thank the media for enablising the support of the community and for the respect they've shown our family in reporting on Sam's disappearance. 'We are especially grateful to the police for their rapid response and for the professionalism, and support, keeping us informed and staying with us at all times during this terrible ordeal.' Sam's parents have asked for any donations to be made to the Autism Association of WA in lieu of tributes. Incident Controller Inspector Gary Lewis said he wanted to make a particular note of the 'immense community support' the family received during the difficult time. 'At 3am we had people from as far as Rockingham and Warnbro arriving to assist in the inquires.' 'We'd like to thank those people.' 'I'd like to pay particular thanks to the vast numbers of SES, fire brigade, police and other emergency services who came out to assist. 'I'd like to make a request on behalf of the family that you respect their privacy at this time. 'When news broke this morning there was approximately 200 to 300 volunteers and they all looked visibly shaken.' Divers were searching the lake near Sam's home on Tuesday, but returned on Wednesday to search again . Sam Trott's body was found in the lake at Landsdale's Warradale Park near Perth  by divers and emergency workers on Wednesday morning just before 10am local time. The two-year-old went missing at 10.30am on Tuesday when he wandered out of his front door after workmen left it open. The news of his death comes after hundreds of nearby residents joined the search for Sam as  rescue teams  scoured the lakes and streets looking under cars, behind fences and in bushes. Volunteers near the lake where Sam was found sat in silence after hearing the news, before starting to sing the toddler's favourite song, 'Wheels on the Bus', Nine News reported. Police cordoned off the area and were supporting the little boy's family. 'It is with great sadness that we provide this update.. We thank the community and SES volunteers for the strong support we received during the search for Sam,' WA Police said in a statement. Sam's grandfather Geoff earlier issued a plea for search teams to start singing 'Wheels on the Bus' in the hope he might respond if he hears his favourite song, Perth Now reports. Police were also considering playing the song out loud to coax the two-year-old out if he has found a hiding space. 'It was a tough night,' Mr Trott said. It comes after hundreds of nearby residents joined the search for Sam as search and rescue teams scoured the streets . Police dogs and the air wing unit were also been called in. 'Reminder to all, before you leave to work or leave your drive-ways to please check under, around and inside vehicles just in case Sam has crawled under or inside any of those places overnight,' WA Police said on Wednesday morning. Police also called on residents in neighbouring streets who may have CCTV cameras outside their homes to come forward. Sam's parents, Lyndal and Matthew, gave a statement on Tuesday afternoon pleading for people to help look for their little boy. 'Check your backyards, your frontyards, check your bushes ... he could be hiding in your garden,' Mr Trott said. 'He can be quite sociable but by the same token he could run away. If you see him and he runs away run after him, catch him please because we really need him to come home. Sam's parents, Lyndal and Matthew, say their little boy went missing in a matter of seconds after workmen left the front door open as they were installing mirrors . Sam's grandfather Geoff has asked search teams to start singing 'Wheels on the Bus' in the hope he might respond if he hears his favourite song . 'If you've got little drains, you know, he's autistic, so he may not play with normal toys, so he could be hiding in the garden. 'He could be hiding somewhere, he could be wandering around he may well have got tired and laid down for a sleep.' Police have praised the community saying the help so far has been 'overwhelming'. Sam went missing in a matter of seconds after workmen left the front door open as they were installing mirrors. 'I heard the fridge door beep because he was in the fridge, I said 'shut the door Sam'. Thirty seconds later it beeped again and as I turned back around ... he wasn't there,' Ms Trott told Perth Now. 'I immediately saw the front door open and I just ran; I ran out the front. In 30 seconds he was not there anymore. 'When I looked left and right, straight ahead and I couldn't see him I ran straight back inside, I went through every room screaming his name. 'He doesn't know how to open doors but the door was wide open.' Hundreds of nearby residents joined the renewed search for little Sam on Wednesday . One hundred extra SES volunteers joined the search and trawled the streets near Sam's home . Rescue teams searched under bushes in case Sam had taken refuge underneath them . Just before 10am on Wednesday, volunteers and media were pushed back from the lake where Sam's body was subsequently recovered from . Hundreds of neighbours lined up early on Wednesday to volunteer to search for Sam . Hundreds of people have since taken to social media to express grief and pay tribute to Sam, his family and those involved in the search. 'My heart is broken. Such a tragic ending. Credit to all the Perth community and emergency services who put in such a tremendous effort to search for this gorgeous little boy, I feel very sad and overwhelmed,' Brittaney McCulloch posted on Facebook. 'The whole city cries with them. Rest peacefully little man. Deepest sympathy to Sam's family and all involved,' Kerrie Broun. Cidalia Francis: 'Sam, Sam, Sam....I never met you, but you have stolen my heart! Keep close to mummy, daddy and big brother. They need you right now. You are such a little adventurer and my big hero! Rest in peace angel.' WA Police briefed the residents who showed up to help looked for little Sam on Wednesday . Some residents even left out containers of food and water for the little boy in case he reappeared overnight . The land search and rescue operation is continuing on Wednesday with the assistance of State Emergency Service volunteers . Lakes surrounding the nearby school are also being combed by police divers with Sam known to like water . Police dogs and the air wing unit have also been called in as the desperate search continues . At least 100 State Emergency Services volunteers have joined the search on Wednesday morning as police and search teams comb  the area .

"The German government does not want to allow Edward Snowden into the country as it fears this may damage relations with the United States . Germany's highest court has thrown out a bid by opposition parties to force the government to allow Edward Snowden to come to Berlin to testify about the National Security Agency's activities. Members of the opposition Greens and Left Party want a parliamentary panel investigating the NSA's operations to hear from the whistleblower in person. But the government does not want to allow Snowden into the country, as it fears this could damage to relations with the US and put it under pressure to extradite him. The Federal Constitutional Court said on Friday that it has rejected as legally inadmissible a suit by the two opposition parties against the government's stance. Government parties on the panel suggested questioning Snowden in Moscow, where he is currently living in exile. But the former NSA contractor has said through a lawyer he will only speak to the panel if allowed to do so Germany. Snowden is currently wanted in the US after leaking classified details of government surveillance programmes. Support for Snowden peaked in Germany last year when reports based on documents leaked by the whistleblower suggested that the NSA had targeted Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. Germany's chief federal prosecutor  in June opened an investigation into the alleged monitoring of a cellphone Merkel used for party business. But this week Harald Range said  his office so far has found no actionable evidence that the calls were tapped. 'As of today, there is no evidence leading to charges that connection data were recorded or a phone call by the chancellor was listened to,' he said. German magazine Der Spiegel broke the story of the alleged monitoring last year, citing documents provided by Snowden. Edward Snowden, who is in Moscow, is seen on a giant screen during a live video conference for an interview as part of Amnesty International's annual Write for Rights campaign at the Gaite Lyrique in Paris this week . Range said his office does not have an original NSA document ordering the surveillance, and that Der Spiegel invoked its right to refuse testimony in response to a request to provide the original or answer questions about it. The NSA has declined to comment, Snowden has not responded to an offer to give a written statement, and requests for information to various German security authorities 'haven't taken us further', Range said. However, he said the investigation continues and will take account of what a separate parliamentary inquiry finds out.

"We've probably all got a box of it in our kitchen cupboards - but most of us would never think of forking out £3 for a single bowl. But in an area where more than one in two children grow up in poverty, that's exactly what happened today. Queues formed outside the door of the newly opened Cereal Killer Cafe on London's Brick Lane despite one of its owner's yesterday being left red faced in a TV interview by not knowing anything about the financial struggles of the majority of the residents who live in the area where he has set up shop. Scroll down for video . Popular place: Lines formed outside the doors of the newly opened Cereal Killer Cafe in Brick Lane today despite one of its owners yesterday being left red faced during a TV interview after not knowing anything about the financial struggles of the majority of people living in the borough of Tower Hamlets . Flat out: Customers lined up to take their pick from the 120 varieties of cereal on offer at the cafe . Awkward: Gary Keely, left, who founded Cereal Killer Cafe with his twin brother Alan, appeared surprised to learn that the restaurant was located in the deprived borough of Tower Hamlets during a TV interview . Challenged: The cafe-owner (left in white) said that his prices were 'cheap' for the area when questioned by a journalist from Channel 4 (right). Small bowls of cereal start at £2.50 . Out-of-touch hipster Gary Keely, who opened the cafe with his twin brother Alan, didn't know their business was in the deprived borough of Tower Hamlets, and even claimed that the niche cafe was 'cheap'. The cringe-worthy encounter was captured on camera by Channel 4, who spoke to the identical twins from Belfast on whether Tower Hamlets residents could afford to eat at their cafe. The east London borough is one of the capital's poorest, where more than one in two children grow up living in poverty. The cafe is heavy on the nostalgia, with limited-edition boxes and collectibles proudly displayed on furniture reminiscent of yesteryear. The eighties and nineties 'vibe', which is also driving trends in fashion and music, continues with the music choices and vintage magazines. The cafe also employs a 'mixologist' - who combines different types of cereal for customers looking for something different. After tasting one of the 120 varieties on offer, priced at £3.20, the journalist asks Gary whether he thought it was a lot to charge for a bowl. Defensive: After being repeatedly asked about whether he thought people in the area could afford to eat in the cafe, Mr Keely demands that the interview is stopped, saying he 'doesn't like the questions' Hipster: The Cereal Killer cafe was founded by identical twins Alan (right) and Gary Keely from Belfast . Niches: Along with 120 varieties of cereal, the restaurant also offers 20 toppings and 12 different milk options . The restaurateur seems surprised by the question, responding, 'I think it is quite cheap for the area'. He is then challenged by the interviewer, who points out that the cafe is in one of the poorest parts of London - and asks again whether £3 seemed like a premium price. Mr Keely looks to justify the extraordinary cost, explaining that many of the brands are 'imported from America'. The interviewer then asks what this means for the people who live in the area, where the proportion of children living in poverty has nearly reached 50 per cent. Mr Keely responds: 'This isn't one of the poorest areas, is it?' Deprived: The cafe, pictured above, is in Tower Hamlets, where one in two children live in poverty . Imported: Mr Keely says that the reason the cereals cost so much is because some are American brands . The journalist clarifies that it is one of the poorest areas, and asks again whether he thought local people would be able to afford £3.20 cereal. Mr Keely responds, 'Well, if they are poor, probably not then.' The cafe owner becomes defensive and starts asking to stop the interview because 'he doesn't like the questions'. The interviewer says that he thinks the questions are fair, but the clip ends shortly after. Earlier this week, the Keelys spoke about the reason behind opening their cereal cafe. Gary said: 'We thought ""Why isn't there anywhere that you can just go and sit down and have a bowl of cereal?"" 'So we went and did some research into it – would it work as a business? How would it look? Where would we get the cereal from? And everything was just ticking all the boxes for us. The cafe is open from 7am until 10pm and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner - meaning cereal aficionados can get their fix pretty much anytime of day. Behind the counter, brightly-coloured boxes line the walls and offerings are as diverse as Golden Grahams and Reese's Puffs to Cap'n Crunch and Apple Jacks. Asked about his favourite cereal, he said: 'I really love the Boo-berry, Count Chocula and Franken-berry – these are limited-edition Halloween cereals that are only available one month of the year in America. 'We've got these, but really limited-edition, so we've only got about 20 boxes of them.' Located in east London, Tower Hamlets has the highest rate of child poverty in the country - it reached 49 per cent this year, up from 42 per cent last year. It also has the second highest unemployment rate in London. Every ward has a higher proportion of people claiming out of work benefits than the London average. But the problems are by no means confined to the economic - Tower Hamlets also has very high rates of long term illness and premature death. Yet this is only half the picture. Tower Hamlets also has some of the highest paid people in London, working in the financial district of Canary Wharf, which has European headquarters for HSBC, Citibank and Barclays. The proportion of jobs in Tower Hamlets that are low paid is one of the smallest in the capital. The borough also boasts booming Brick Lane, which lies at the centre of Britain's hipster culture and is home to a number of quirky bars and restaurants. At a number of these establishments, including the Cereal Killer Cafe, customers can expect to pay a premium for the out-of-the-ordinary experiences. Just down the road from Cereal Killer Cafe is Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium. There, visitors pay £5 to book a table in the cafe, which is home to a number of rescue cats.","Queues today snaked down the street outside the Cereal Killer Cafe .

"Told off: Osteopath Paul Bolton regularly left patients unattended, a panel was told . An osteopath left acupuncture needles sticking out of a patient's backside while he nipped off to a café for sausage rolls, a disciplinary panel was told. Paul Bolton regularly left patients unattended and told a colleague who challenged him that he would ‘strangle her slowly and watch her eyeballs pop out’, it heard. The British former soldier and police officer was fined £1,500 by the medical authorities in New Zealand over the alleged litany of misconduct and banned from practising for 12 months. However he has since returned home and is advertising services including acupuncture, massage and spinal manipulation. Mr Bolton spent six months working as an osteopath at the Consultancy House Clinic in Dunedin during which there were ‘seven or eight’ complaints from patients, New Zealand’s Health Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal was told. A massage therapist at the clinic told the tribunal he would often see clients lying unattended on the treatment table with acupuncture needles in their back. He described one morning when he saw Mr Bolton walk up the stairs with a cup of coffee and a bag full of sausage rolls even though he had a patient on the table ‘with a backside full of needles hooked up to the Tens (electro-acupuncture) machine’. He was also said to have jammed needles into a woman's back without warning, putting holes in her t-shirt, and carrying out a strong neck manipulation that left her sore for six months. When clinic managers began to realise he left clients unattended, he was challenged, but he ‘just yelled and screamed’ and refused to talk about it, the hearing was told. The clinic told the tribunal Mr Bolton was ‘aggressive with his patients, was intimidating towards his patients, swore and was too loud’, with two colleagues saying they could hear all his conversations with clients through the concrete walls. The tribunal heard numerous evidence of Mr Bolton's ‘excessively inappropriate foul language’, and how he spent more time talking about himself than engaging with his patients, answering his mobile phone and having personal conversations. When he was confronted for using foul language by one office manager he allegedly ‘called her a 'f***ing c***’. Several incidents: While working at Consultancy House Clinic in Dunedinm Mr Bolton left acupuncture needles sticking out of a patient's bottom while he went out to buy sausage rolls . One colleague said Mr Bolton ‘would typically start the sentence with a 'f***' finish it with a 'f***' and have a 'f***' somewhere in the middle of it. He would frequently use the words 'f***' and 'c***' as part of a normal conversation’. The HPDT ruled that his ‘use of bad language ... is unprofessional and brings discredit to the osteopathy profession’. It had come to the ‘distinct conclusion that Mr Bolton is a large man with a loud voice and an intimidating manner’, who had told a colleague he wanted to ‘strangle (another colleague) slowly and watch her eyeballs pop out’. Ruling that he had brought discredit to his profession in his stint there in 2011-12, it said he had put patients at ‘significant risk’ by leaving them alone while they had acupuncture needles inserted, particularly when electro-acupuncture was being used. It suspended him from practising for 12 months, fined him $3000 (£1,490) and ordered him to pay $45,714 (£22,700) towards the costs of the investigation and hearing. Mr Bolton misspelled his place of work,  has since been working at Carlisle Complementary Therapies – misspelt as ‘complimentary’ on his personal website . Mr Bolton has since been working at Carlisle Complementary Therapies – misspelt as ‘complimentary’ on his personal website – but staff there said yesterday he had been an independent practitioner who was no longer running clinics there. According to the site he offers acupuncture, massage, ‘spinal manipulation’ and exercise advice, charging £50-an-hour. It says that after serving with the Royal Engineers and stints on drilling rigs and with the police he found his ‘true vocation’ studying sports therapy, later training as an osteopath and working with top rugby and football clubs. His biography states: ‘In 2010 I fulfilled a personal dream and worked for two years in the South Island NZ as an Osteopath to the local sporting community and farming communities.’ A woman at his family home in Carlisle declined to comment yesterday, and messages left on the phone number on his website were not returned. A spokeswoman for Britain’s General Osteopathic Council said Mr Bolton was not registered as an osteopath in this country and therefore not entitled to practise using the term. It added that it was in touch with its counterpart in New Zealand and would take the findings of its investigation into account should he seek to register here.","British osteopath working in New Zealand fined £1,500 for misconduct .

"Celebrity chef Pete Evans has been given the silver medal for the worst diet of the year, but the My Kitchen Rules host has ridiculed the claims, labelling them laughable. The British Dietetic Association named the paleo diet second on the list of diets to avoid for 2014, just days before Evans is set to release his new cookbook 'Paleo Everyday'. The paleo diet, which Evans championed in Australia, was knocked out of first place only by 'uro-therapy', which involves drinking urine for health benefits. Scroll down for video . My Kitchen Rules host and celebrity chef Pete Evans has ridiculed a new list of the top diets to avoid of 2014 . Evans spoke out on his Facebook page about the list, asking 'is someone taking the p**s?', in reference to uro-therapy, which has been adopted by Bear Grylls. 'I usually don't post things like this but I couldn't stop laughing and thought you could do with a belly laugh too!' Evans posted to his followers. The diet involves eating 'like a cave man', restricting consumption to fuel that would have been available during the stone age. Evans' book 'The Paleo Chef' was a hit within Australia, supporting the regime known as the Paleolithic Diet, the Caveman diet and the Stone Age Diet, which involves no processed foods, no sugar, no dairy, no grains, and no legumes. The Dietetic Association slammed the diet as 'an unbalanced, time-consuming, socially isolating diet...a sure-fire way to develop nutrient deficiencies, which can compromise health and your relationship with food.' The Dieticians Association of Australia labelled the fad diet, which is reportedly followed by celebrities such as Miley Cyrus and Matthew McConaughey, inappropriate for today's lifestyle and life expectancy. The paleo diet, of which Evans is a champion, came second on the list, losing out only to the 'urine therapy' diet . Evans has been slammed for his 'feelpinions' this week after launching an anti-flouride campaign in Western Australia . 'I think we’ve got to realise that the average age of cave men was 25 years old,' Julie Gilbert, spokesperson for the DAA told news.com.au. 'So while the paleo diet might have supported them, that diet is not going to support us where our life expectancy is into our 80s,' she said. 'Any diet that cuts kilojoules will end up in weight loss. But you don’t have to cut out whole food groups — like grains or dairy — to achieve that.' Evans found the Dietetic Association's ruling humourous and suggested that next year he might take top spot on the list. 'The UK version of the DAA have listed the paleo diet just behind urine therapy as the worst possible diets,' he said. 'I am slightly p**sed off by the urine drinkers for taking out first place...Haha! Maybe next year we can beat them to top place, but not at their own game...ewww!' the chef wrote. Evans is no stranger to controversy over the paleo diet, experiencing ridicule from media and health experts when he announced in 2012 that he enjoyed eating 'activated almonds'. Several parody Twitter accounts have been created to mock the celebrity chef, in response to his outrageous claims . Australian Medical Association Victorian president Tony Bartone told Daily Mail Australia that Evans should stick to what he knows best . Several parody Twitter accounts have been created to mock the celebrity chef, in response to his outrageous claims. One of the accounts is listed under the title of 'I love psuedoscience'. The account's description says 'fad diets rule,' and has the location set to 'kale'. 'It's official, I'm better than p**s!' said one tweet. Evans has been slammed for his 'feelpinions' this week after launching an anti-fluoride campaign in Western Australia, enraging medical professionals who have described his standpoint as misinformed and a potentially dangerous lifestyle choice.

Australian Medical Association Victorian president Tony Bartone told Daily Mail Australia that Evans should stick to what he knows best. 'It's official, I'm better than p**s!' said one tweet . In October, Evans posted a rant on Facebook claiming that the modern Australian diet was behind the rise in autism . One of the parody accounts is listed under the title of 'I love psuedoscience'. The account's description says 'fad diets rule,' and has the location set to 'kale' 'Celebrity chefs should stick to their knitting and stay out of the debate - his comments belong back in the Stone Age.' 'I'm occasionally ridiculed or accused of ignorance because I choose to eat and feed my family what I believe to be a nutrient-dense diet,' Evans said on his Facebook page. 'I can't help but find it so bizarre as to why some people find my food choices so offensive?' In October, Evans posted a rant on Facebook claiming that the modern Australian diet was behind the rise in autism. His fiery post, which was motivated by a rude comment from a dietician on his Facebook page, challenged the idea of the Heart Foundation's tick and also questioned some of the beliefs held by the DAA - both of which have spoken out against the paleo diet. 'Why has our rate of autism jumped from 1 in 10000 children in 1974, to 1 in 50 in 2014, where do you think it will be in another 40 years if it is escalating at this rate? This has grown rapidly since the guidelines have been in place!' Evans wrote. In October, Evans posted a rant on Facebook claiming that the modern Australian diet was behind the rise in autism. But his 2,100 word post wasn't just limited to autism. He also listed a number of other issues he believes the two nutrition organisations needed to address. 'Isn't it interesting that the people trusted to be delivering health advice for the public have come out not once, not twice, but so many times over the last year or so that I can't keep up with it, with a media campaign to bring down the paleo way of life by saying it is dangerous,' he wrote. 'Why is Australia fast becoming the most obese and unhealthy nations on earth? Is this because we are a nation of self-obsessed, weak-minded people with no self-control? No. Is it because we are a nation that for far too long has been told to steer clear of foods naturally high in fat, which naturally trigger our fullness hormone, and instead told to eat 6 - 8 servings of processed carbohydrate a day, and wonder why we are still hungry after eating 3 cups of rice or 6 slices of bread?' He said the DAA and Heart Foundation had 'ignited a spark that has been inside me, which is now a raging fire in my belly'.","The British Dietetic Association named the Paleo diet second on their annual list of fads to avoid, behind only the 'urine therapy' diet .

Last month he filed a lawsuit and is suing her for the return of not only the ring, Porsche and dog, but also his Keurig coffee maker, two ladders, a $400 flower arrangement and $2,350 worth of Christmas decorations and tablecloths from Pier 1. Herbstritt isn't willing to hand the gifts back and on Monday her attorney filed paperwork asking for the suit to be dismissed. She argues that Parker has provided nothing in writing to show that he owns the items. 'It's my stuff,' she told the Orlando Sentinel. Parker has refused to comment on the legal action, but according to the suit he wants the 31/2 diamond carats ring he gave Herbstritt when he proposed on her 47th birthday returned because he paid for it. Among the items that Parker and Herbstritt are fighting over is a Weimaraner dog, pictured, that he claims he paid $1,500 for and then invest another 43,500 on 'extensive training' According to his personal profile on his business' website, Parker enjoys boating, fishing, working out, and he has a special interest in fast exotic cars. According to the suit, the Porsche he bought Herbstritt this year is jointly registered in both their names. The father of two college age sons also says the dog he bought Herbstritt is worth $5,000 after he paid $1,500 and then invested another $3,500 on 'extensive training.' Parker divorced his wife in 2009, while Herbstritt started working at his clinic in 2008. According to the suit, the couple hadn't set a wedding date and Herbstritt left without advance warning when she moved out on September 16.

"Two former Indiana cops who are married to each other have been arrested and charged amid allegations of being involved in one of the country's biggest-ever drug busts. Jason Woods, 44, and Teresa Woods, 34, were booked into the Boone County Jail on Thursday on two counts of possession of a synthetic drug or synthetic drug lookalike. Police allege the arrests are linked to an illegal 'Spice' ring headquartered in central Indiana that was shut down last year, leading to over 12 arrests. Indiana State Police called it the largest operation in state history and one of the largest in the nation, according to Fox 59. Busted: Teresa Woods, 43, and her husband Jason Woods, 44, have both been charged with two counts of possession of a synthetic drug or synthetic drug lookalike . Charged: The couple were fired from their positions as Hendricks County deputies earlier this year for being found in possession of thousands of dollars in missing money . Over 500 pounds of synthetic drugs were seized in New Palestine as part of that operation. Police now say they have been onto the Woods since the bust. 'The Woods’ name came up in the course of that investigation,' Captain David Bursten, Spokesperson for Indiana State Police, told Fox 59. The Woods were caught with over 100 grams of synthetic drugs and $80,000. The family of Theresa Woods are believed to have dobbed in the couple, calling police to say the drugs and money were being kept in a safe. The couple were arrested at the Indianapolis office of Homeland Security Investigations on charges of possession of a synthetic drug. No comment: Jason Woods would not talk to the media after bonding out of Boone County jail . Scene: Over 500 pounds of synthetic drugs were seized in New Palestine, Indiana, as part of a Spice ring raid in 2013 that was one of the biggest-ever in the country . 'We were able to get a search warrant,' Burstein told Fox 59. 'From that, we found inside over 100 grams of synthetic drugs and we also found $80,000 in cash.' The two have not been charged in relation to the 2013 Spice ring. It is not known whether they will face charges in relation to that bust. Warrant: The Woods allegedly had about 100 grams of drugs and $80,000 cash locked in a safe at this home . In March the pair were suspended and later fired from their positions as Hendricks County deputies. They were allegedly found in possession of thousands of dollars of missing money. The Woods' had said they were keeping the money for a friend. They were accused of not following the department’s policy as well as not reporting a crime they knew about.","Jason Woods, 44, and Teresa Woods, 34, were booked into the Boone County Jail in Indiana on Thursday .

"The family and friends of  the the South African teacher killed during a botched US raid on al-Qaeda militants in Yemen paid their final respects at his funeral in Bloemfontein. Pierre Korkie's tearful widow Yolande followed the flower-laden casket, which was carried by uniformed students from Grey College School where he had taught.

Pierre Korkie's tearful widow Yolande follows the flower-laden casket, which was carried by uniformed students at the South African school where he had taught . The funeral has attended by U.S. Ambassador Patrick Gaspard after Korkie's widow, Yolande, invited him, the embassy said. 'If I had to take one message from the proceedings, it was forgiveness,' said Ali Sayed, spokesman for Gift of the Givers. The South African aid group had been negotiating for Korkie's release and said he was just hours from his freedom when US Navy SEALS  stormed into the compound where he and  Somers were being held. Somers was also killed in the raid. But Yolande - who was kidnapped alongside her husband in Taiz in May 2013 - said the family had chosen to approach the tragedy with love and forgiveness. Pall bearers carry the coffin of Pierre Korkie, killed in Yemen during a botched US raid on al-Qaeda militants . Pierre's wife Yolande Korkie and their son Pieter-Ben follow the coffin at the funeral service . 'Today we choose to forgive,' she said. 'We choose to love. We choose to rejoice in the memories of Pierre and keep him alive in our hearts.' 'Even though the pain is overwhelming us right now, we choose to believe that this too shall pass.' Pierre Korkie was killed during a failed US rescue raid in Yemen hours before he was to be released . Yolande was released in January following mediation by the Gift of the Givers charity. She said: 'Although we were separated in the flesh after 228 days when I was released, I remained with him in spirit until the end.' The government of South Africa - like the United States - has a strict policy of not paying ransoms to terrorist groups holding their citizens, maintaining that payments encourage kidnappers and perpetuate the problem. US president Barack Obama sanctioned the mission and secretary of state John Kerry cited 'a compelling indication that Luke's life was in immediate danger' and said 'we recommended that the president authorise an attempt to rescue Luke'. Speaking in Afghanistan, defence secretary Chuck Hagel said the rescue operation was 'extremely well executed' but complicated and risky. The Navy SEALs landed by helicopter six miles from the Al-Qaeda compound where the hostages were being held. Speaking anonymously to the BBC, senior officials said 40 special forces soldiers, backed by Yemeni troops, advanced to within 100m of the site, but were spotted by a militant. The terrorist was briefly seen running into the compound, which is likely to be when the hostages were shot. Mr Korkie died on a helicopter and Mr Somers died on board a US navy ship.

"A benefits cheat who stole almost 26,000 by claiming he could barely walk was caught after investigators filmed him jogging and kicking debris while working as a race track marshall. Anthony Carter, 60, was first granted disability living allowance as a result of his arthritis and hip problems. He recently told authorities he needed a walking stick to get around - but a court heard how his physical condition had improved by 2006 following a hip operation. Scroll down for video . Benefits cheat: Anthony Carter continued to claim thousands of pounds in disability allowance - claiming that he was barely able to walk - despite his physical condition improving in 2006 following a hip operation . Investigators from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) launched a surveillance operation into Carter after receiving a tip-off about his scam. They discovered he was carrying out voluntary work as a race track marshal and attending several meetings a year in Derbyshire. Video footage captured by undercover investigators showed Carter walking along the race track, kicking at debris and jogging. Scam: The benefits cheat illegally claimed almost £26,000 in disability allowance from 2006 to 2013 . He was also spotted holding a large flag and waving it when necessary at the racing events. A court heard the fraudster was overpaid £25,925 in disability living allowance between March 2006 and August last year. Carter, of Wolverhampton, West Midlands, admitted dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstances affecting entitlement to benefit. But he was spared jail and was sentenced to 20 weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Tuesday. Judge Peter Barrie told Carter it was public money and said he had a responsibility to notify the authorities of a change in any circumstances. He said: 'You had a hip replacement operation and got much better. 'In 2006 you were able to be active working as a volunteer race marshal and clearly at that point not entitled to receive these benefits. 'It is a serious form of fraud.' Carter was also ordered to pay back the entire amount he fraudulently claimed between March 2006 and August 2013. Prosecutor Nicholas Berry said Carter admitted his role during interviews and told the DWP his main duty was to stand at a designated part of the track. But video footage played in court shows the fraudster dressed in bright orange overalls jogging alongside the track as go-karts speed past nearby. He can also be seen standing in a cage waving a giant yellow flag in the 1..07-minute video which was filmed in September 2012. Samantha Powis, defending, said Carter had been a hardworking man until his physical difficulties and the claim began legitimately. She added: 'He's unlikely to ever trouble the courts again. 'He's very concerned. He's very frightened.' Speaking after the case, Sian Fellowes, a DWP fraud manager in the West Midlands, said: 'It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system. Spared jail: Carter was given a 20-week suspended prison sentence at Wolverhampton Crown Court (above) 'Our welfare reforms are vital to close the gaps that cheats take advantage of. 'It is unfair that some people get support when they do not have a disability, while many people depend on the benefits system to provide a safety net. 'Deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime. Don't wait for our fraud investigators to find you. Tell us of a change now.'","Anthony Carter, of Wolverhampton, claimed thousands in benefits illegally .

"Brain dead: Jahi McMath was declared brain dead on December 12 after she went into cardiac arrest following surgery to treat sleep apnea . It is exactly a year since 13-year-old Jahi McMath fell brain dead following a minor operation and doctors signed her death certificate. But she remains hooked to a ventilator. In a case that has ignited debate over the definition of brain death, Jahi's parents remain adamant that as long as her heart is beating, she is alive. To prove that point, the family from Oakland, California, released videos in October of the girl which showed her foot and hand appearing to move in response to her mother's commands. However, numerous medics have dismissed the apparent development as involuntary muscle reflex often seen in brain-dead patients - the so-called Lazarus effect. Paul Fisher, a Stanford University pediatric neurologist, told a California judge in October that he sees no evidence that Jahi McMath is alive 10 months after a coroner signed her death certificate. Jahi was declared brain dead on December 12, 2013, after she went into cardiac arrest following surgery to treat sleep apnea. Fisher dismissed videos showing the girl moving her hands and feet at her mother's command. Her family wants Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo to issue what would be an unprecedented order to reverse the death certificate, declaring her to be alive after being declared brain dead. The family's lawyer Christopher Dolan told the judge he wanted time for the court-appointed doctor and his own medical experts to confer. No new court date has been scheduled. 'There wasn't time to react to this letter,' Dolan said. 'Given the fact that we were up against the time crunch ... I thought that we were going to be in essence sandbagged.' Dolan objected to Fisher's appointment as an independent expert, arguing that the doctor has a conflict of interest because he was one of the physicians who agreed with the brain-death diagnosis last December. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mother: Jahi's mother, Latasha Winkfield, has worked to keep her daughter's organs functioning on life support, first at Children's Hospital in Oakland, then at an undisclosed facility, and now a house in New Jersey . Dismissed: A doctor dismissed videos showing the girl moving her hands and feet at her mother's command . 'I just wanted to give these doctors a chance to talk,' Dolan said. Five other medical professionals who performed new tests on the teenager in New Jersey in September said the girl showed signs of brain function. In his letter to the judge, Fisher replied that the tests either were irrelevant to determining brain death in a child or not carried out in accordance with accepted medical standards. 'None of the declarations provide evidence that Jahi McMath is not brain dead,' he wrote. Jahi has been kept on a ventilator and feeding tubes since she suffered severe complications from the surgery. Fisher examined her then at the request of the judge while her family fought a hospital's decision to remove the equipment. Fisher was one of three doctors who declared her brain-dead after finding no neurological activity. Dolan has given the judge the results of a September 1 electroencephalogram that a researcher at a medical school in Cuba said showed electrical activity in Jahi's brain. Fisher, in his letter to the judge, said the new test was performed in an apartment, not a health care setting, and the recorded activity could have come from elsewhere in the girl's body or even the environment. Tests: Five medical professionals who performed new tests on the teenager in New Jersey last month said the girl showed signs of brain function . Regardless, he said, a flat reading on the exam is not a prerequisite for brain death. Fisher similarly took issue with the brain scan that allegedly showed blood flowing to Jahi's brain. He said the test doctors and researchers from the nonprofit International Brain Research Foundation used was incorrect and would not have demonstrated such blood flow. Jahi's mother, Latasha Winkfield, has worked to keep her daughter's organs functioning on life support, first at Children's Hospital in Oakland and later at an undisclosed medical facility, and now a house in New Jersey. Unlike California, New Jersey law allows families to reject a declaration of brain death on religious grounds and allows brain-dead patients to remain connected to ventilators.","Jahi McMath had cardiac arrest after sleep apnea surgery on Dec 12, 2013 .

"Thousands of people are claiming to experience pleasure from listening to whispers and scratchy noises in a bizarre phenomenon known as ASMR, it has emerged. Even watching the gentle act of folding towels gives some people a tingle down the spine and a tingle in their scalp. Known as Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, the idea of it may seem like an April Fool’s day joke. Scroll down for video . Pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge wrapping Christmas gifts in New York would have been popular with devotees of Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, the phenomenon of experiencing pleasure from mundane activities such as wrapping presents or folding towels . But its devotees insist it is a real phenomenon, and has spawned a cottage industry, with dozens of video artists creating pleasurable sensations for viewers from a myriad of different sources. There are ASMR videos of polished fingernails tapping on a plastic surface, of someone wrapping presents, of people being given massages, of performers whispering to camera in Latin. There are people pretending to be doctors giving the viewer a ‘cranial nerve exam’, and others pretending to cut your hair, pretending to give you a job interview or pretending to be a receptionist at hotel check-in. There is no scientific evidence to explain ASMR but brain scientists say the hard wiring of some people’s brains mean they get stimulation from quietly satisfying things. Viewing videos to recreate the sensation provides an extra ‘shot’ of pleasure, it is claimed. There are ASMR videos of polished fingernails tapping on a plastic surface and of people wrapping gifts . One ASMR video shows someone rustling plastic bags. Devotees insist it is a real phenomenon, and has spawned a cottage industry, with dozens of video artists creating pleasurable sensations for viewers . They are astonishingly popular, with 770,000 views over two years notched up so far for an 18 minute video of a woman demonstrating ways to fold towels and napkins. Among the many who own up to ASMR is BBC science reporter Nick Higham, whose experiences date back decades. He said ‘When I was a child I sometimes experienced a pleasant physical sensation in my scalp when I was especially intrigued or fascinated by something, or when being touched or stroked in certain ways. ‘The sensation continued into adulthood, but when I tried to explain what I was feeling to other people I was met with baffled looks and a quick change of subject.’ He says the videos can trigger - in a minority of people - a particular sensation in their scalp, best described as a buzzing or tingling that’s warm, relaxing and extremely pleasurable. One video of a blonde woman with an eastern European accent who calls herself Maria GentleWhispering lasts 16 minutes and has been viewed 7.6 million times . Some fans say they feel calmer after watching an ASMR video, or that it helps with sleeping difficulties. Francis McGlone, professor of neuroscience at Liverpool John Moores University, has failed to find any research to support a neurobiological basis for why these sensory experiences should be induced by observing ASMR videos. But he is profoundly sceptical of their use as a kind of home-brewed alternative therapy: “ . He said ‘What worries me is susceptible individuals who want to believe this kind of thing because they really have problems and need some kind of psychological help - that is where I get a little bit annoyed, because people can be led up the garden path by techniques that clearly are snake oil, and do not and will not provide any long term benefit for an underlying condition.’ Yale University neuroscientist Steven Novella, who has written about ASMR, says he’s ‘inclined to think it’s a real phenomenon’ not least because so many people report similar experiences. He said ‘I have never experienced this myself. I listened to the whispering in Latin video, which was eerily intimate at first, and then just a bit weird, although I always love listening to Latin. ‘But I experienced no tingling or euphoria.’ He said ‘It is plausible that a subset of the population has a particular pattern of neural hard wiring so that when they experience certain things that are typically quietly satisfying they get a little extra shot to their pleasure centre. ‘Once they experience this then they seek out greater and greater triggers of this response, and perhaps then a learning or conditioning component kicks in.’ The ASMR Research and Support website, which lists the triggers, seeks volunteers for research who have ASMR experiences – and also those who do not for comparison purposes.","Phenomenon has been dubbed Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response .

"Mountain View Farm has voluntarily pulled its range of organic bath milk products off the shelves of heath food stores after the milk was linked to the death of a toddler in Melbourne. Earlier this week a three-year-old from the Mornington Peninsula, south-east of Melbourne, died after allegedly drinking the bath milk. Mountain View Farm issued a statement on its Facebook page on Friday telling customers the product was being voluntarily recalled following a request from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). Scroll down for video . An organic bath milk brand, Mountain View Farm, linked to the death of a toddler has been voluntarily recalled after a request from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission . 'We have been asked by the ACCC to do a voluntary recall,' the statement said. 'If anyone has purchased Mountain View Bath Milk, please either dispose of the container or return to the place of purchase for a refund.' Victoria's health department has warned people against drinking raw milk after the three-year-old died. Four other children under the age of five fell seriously ill after it's believed they drank raw milk. Unpasteurised cow's milk has been banned in Australia for more than 70 years but manufacturers can sell it as a cosmetic product rather than food. The product is advertised on the family-run company's website as 'amazing fresh 'raw bath milk'… dropped off to the farm store every Thursday for pick up'. ACCC deputy chair Delia Rickard urged consumers not to drink the milk. 'The message from health agencies is clear: do not drink unpasteurised milk,' she said. 'If you have this product, do not drink it in any circumstances.' Regulators are considering whether raw milk labels mislead consumers, with the product often sold alongside consumable milk products. A three-year-old allegedly recently died after drinking Mountain View Organic Bath Milk . Chief health officer Dr Rosemary Lester said some people were choosing to drink rawmilk because they believed it was healthier than pasteurised milk. Mountain View Farm owner Vicki Jones told the Herald Sun her company always advised people not to drink the product. 'What people do with milk when they take it home, I can't tell them what to do,' she said. Ms Jones said the company already labelled their milk with warnings that it was not for consumption, in accordance with health department regulations, but was happy to make any recommended changes. 'We've told them we're happy to add extra labelling and warnings to the milk,' she said. 'We're happy to comply with whatever they request.' The raw milk is often sold in fridges near to the pasteurised drinking milk and its packaging looks similar to that of regular milk. There has been a resurgence in people wanting to drink raw milk as part of a belief that raw and unprocessed food is healthier. They claim it is more nutritious, easier to digest and contains probiotics - and that it's better for cows and farms. Dr Rosemary Lester (left) from Victoria's Department of Health has issued a health warning. The raw milk is often sold near pasteurised milk (right) However, Dr Lester warned that raw milk can affect the kidneys and the bloodstream and cause watery diarrhoea. In addition 'only a small number of these pathogens are needed to cause illness,' Dr Lester said. She said unpasteurised milk could make anyone sick but risks were greatest for young children and elderly, pregnant or otherwise unhealthy people. 'Since the 1940s, it has been compulsory to pasteurise cow's milk in Australia,' Dr Lester said. 'Milk is heated for a very short period of time, effectively destroying any disease-causing bacteria which may be present in raw milk.' Dr Lester has referred the matter to Consumer Affairs Victoria and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), saying bath milk packaging was very similar to drinking milk and they could be easily confused. Consumer Affairs Victoria director Dr Claire Noone says the watchdog will review the marketing of raw milk and work with the ACCC to establish whether there had been a breach of consumer law. 'In Victoria it is illegal to package, deliver or provide raw milk for human consumption. However, it still may be labelled and sold for cosmetic use,' she said in a statement on Thursday. An ACCC spokesperson said the commission would consider the adequacy of labelling but urged consumers to follow safety instructions on product packaging. The State Coroner will investigate the child's death. Dr Lester says on the Department's website: 'The Department has been notified of a number of illnesses including three cases of Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) and two cases of cryptosporidiosis. All cases have consumed unpasteurised (raw) milk which is sold as 'bath' or 'cosmetic' milk in Victoria.' She explained: 'Cryptosporidiosis is a parasitic infection that commonly presents are gastroenteritis with watery diarrhoea. 'HUS is a rare condition which can be caused by shiga toxin and verotoxin producing E.coli that affects the kidneys and the bloodstream. Children are most susceptible to contracting HUS, which begins with abdominal pains and bloody diarrhoea which can last for about a week. 'Serious cases of HUS can lead to renal failure and death. Only small numbers of these pathogens are needed to cause illness.' Because the products are classed as cosmetic and are marked 'not for human consumption' the department has no power to recall them. Dr Lester said: 'In Australia, the sale of unpasteurised (raw) cow's milk for human consumption is illegal. In Victoria, it is also illegal to package, deliver or provide unpasteurised (raw) milk for human consumption. Unpasteurised milk is sometimes labelled and sold for cosmetic use only. 'Packaging of unpasteurised milk is often very similar to other milk products. 'Unpasteurised milk should not be consumed.'","Mountain View Farm has recalled its organic bath milk after a request from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission .

"An outstanding soldier who had to leave the Army after an operation for his loud snoring had catastrophic medical consequences has been awarded £1.5million damages at the High Court. Richard Downing was a warrant officer in the Army Air Corps with very good prospects of being commissioned when he had the procedure in November 2006, said the judge Sir David Eady. It made no difference to his snoring but was followed by an infection which led to reactive arthritis and a disabling pain disorder. Mr Downing, now 43, was discharged on medical grounds in August 2010 and is unlikely to work again. Compensation: Richard Downing had to leave the Army after an operation for his loud snoring had catastrophic medical consequences has been awarded £1.5million damages at the High Court . For long periods, said the judge, the father of two, who had served in Bosnia, was effectively a ‘prisoner’ in his home. He had been unable to participate in everyday family activities, and has a severely restricted social life. Mr Downing, from Suffolk, brought an action against Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which agreed to compensate him on the basis of 63 per cent liability, without any admissions being made. The judge said Mr Downing, who is partially wheelchair dependent, was very keen to get better, so far as possible. His sense of injustice stemmed from the fact that he was advised to have a ‘pointless’ operation – which led to his suffering constant pain, the loss of an enjoyable and rewarding career and the fundamental upheaval of his happy family life. Mr Downing told the High Court in London how he felt a ‘failure’ on days when he had to resort to using his wheelchair to get around . ‘Money is never going to compensate adequately for that,’ said the judge.’ Nothing is going to remove that sense of injustice.’ Judge Sir David Eady said that if Mr Downing had not become disabled, it was likely he would have retired at 50 with the rank of captain . The judge said it was unlikely that there would be any significant long-term improvement, still less a cure, so far as Mr Downing’s mobility, pain and tendency towards depression was concerned, and there was no prospect of him resuming any paid employment in the foreseeable future. ‘The contrast with his previous personality, physical capacity and positive lifestyle could hardly be greater,’ the judge said. He added that, thanks mainly to the strength of character of Mr Downing’s wife, ‘the family structure remains largely intact’. The judge said that if Mr Downing had not become disabled, it was likely he would have retired at 50 with the rank of captain and then obtained a responsible post in the private sector where he would have stayed until he was 68. The compensation assessed by the judge includes a sum of £93,000 for pain, suffering and loss of enjoyment of life, £435,000 for future accommodation and £343,650 for future care. Mr Downing told the court in London how he felt a ‘failure’ on days when he had to resort to using his wheelchair to get around the house and ‘detested the contraption’. His former commanding officer said Mr Downing was ‘exceptionally capable’ and ‘stood out’ among his peers.","Richard Downing, of Suffolk, was a warrant officer in the Army Air Corps .

But despite the fall in prices at the supermarkets, drivers in some parts of the country are paying vastly more for their field than others. Petrolprices.com shows that the cheapest price of unleaded currently being offered is for 113.9p with the most expensive at 139.9p. The cheapest litre of diesel is being sold for 123.8p and the most expensive is at 148p. Asda say that from tomorrow the price of a litre of unleaded at one of their forecourts will be 112.7p, while diesel will cost 118.7p . Critics complain that fuel prices soar like a rocket when oil is high but float down 'like a feather' when it falls. Experts said some prices were genuinely high because of the higher cost of transporting fuel to remoter locations such as in the Highlands of Scotland or rural England. But in other cases market forces were responsible with experts saying if retailers can get away with charging a higher price, they will and motorists were being urged to shop around.","Petrol prices are set to plunge to a four-year low over this weekend .
Comes as Asda and Tesco both announced cuts of 2p off litre of unleaded .
Both retailers are also cutting 1p from the price of a litre of diesel .
Sainsbury's and Morrisons are also making the same cuts from tomorrow .
Savings are being passed on after price of crude oil dropped by 40 per cent .

"Three students who featured prominently in a now under-question Rolling Stone article about rape at the University of Virginia, have revealed their identities to refute their cold portrayal in the sickening story. The article sent shockwaves through the university community, after the magazine published a female student's account of being gang-raped by seven men at a UVA fraternity two years ago, leading to the temporary shut down of all Greek life at the Charlottesville campus. Next to victim 'Jackie's' account of the horrifying assault, one of the most appalling aspects of the story are the apathetic reactions of her three friends 'Randall', 'Andy' and 'Cindy' who she called for help after escaping the frat that night in September 2012. The trio are now coming forward to refute key aspects of the Rolling Stone article, saying that while they believe Jackie was the victim of a 'traumatic' sexual assault they have found several inaccuracies in the article and are skeptical of the story. Furthermore, the students say they never discouraged her from reporting the assault, and that they only stopped insisting she contact police when she asked to be taken back to her dorm room. Misrepresented? These are the three friends who ran to alleged rape victim Jackie's aid, the night she told Rolling Stone she was gang raped by seven men at University of Virginia's Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house. Identified as Cindy, Andy and Randall in the article, they say their real names are Kathryn Hendley (left), Alex Stock (center) and Ryan (asked for his last name to be withheld, right) 'The text was so divergent from what we said that evening,' Alex Stock, who was identified as 'Andy in the article, told ABC News on Thursday. In the article Jackie describes meeting a junior boy identified as 'Drew' her first few weeks at UVA, and how the fellow lifeguard asked her out to dinner and a date night function at the Phi Kappa Psi House. Back at the house, she says she was lured to an upstairs bedroom, where she was thrown through a glass table and then raped one by one by seven men in what appeared to be an initiation ritual. When she came to in the early hours of the next morning, Jackie says she fled the house barefoot and then called Randall, Andy and Cindy for help. She says the trio tracked her down to find her bloody and in shock, but described how they were hesitant to report the crime, fearing how it would impact their social lives, the boys' intentions to rush a fraternity and Jackie's college reputation. That's not how the three friends remember the incident. Victim: Jackie (pictured) told Rolling Stone she was violently assaulted by seven men in a fraternity house two weeks into her first year at UVA . The friend identified as 'Randall' in the story, says he was the only one Jackie called that night, contrary to the description of all three responding in unison. He says his real name is Ryan, but asked ABC to withhold his last name. Ryan says he found Jackie outside her dorm 'crying and shaking' and that she told him she was forced to perform oral sex on five men in the frat while a sixth watched. He says he then called Stock, but that Jackie asked the student identified as 'Cindy' not to come. That student has revealed her name to by Kathryn Hendley, and says she came along with Alex anyway, but stood back from the group while Jackie told her story to the two boys. Kathryn directly refutes a line in the article, which quotes her as saying 'She's gonna be the girl who cried ""rape"" and we'll never be allowed into a frat party again.' She says she only heard details of the rape later, first from Stock, then from Jackie herself. Horrified by the story, the friends say they urged Jackie to report the incident to police, but that she declined and asked to go back to her dorm where two of them spent the night comforting her. 'I mean obviously we were very concerned for her,' Stock told the Washington Post. 'We tried to be as supportive as we could be.' The friends also added that Jackie did not appear to be injured, despite her account that she was bleeding significantly from being thrown through a glass table. Further, they also had doubts about her attacker. Wrong: Jackie identified Phi Kappa Psi -known as Phi Psi for short - as the frat house where the attack took place but told the Washington Post she only did so because a friend pointed to it a year later and told her: 'That's where it happened.' Her father said she had got the detail wrong . This past week, Jackie finally named the lifeguard who took her back to the frat to her new friends, but when a reporter gave Randall, Cindy and Andy that name, they said they had never heard of it before. University of Virginia officials also found the name suspect, saying that no one with that name has ever attended the school. The Post interviewed a man with a similar name, and he admitted to working at the pool with her, he says he never met her in person and was not a member of Phi Psi. The fraternity released a separate statement saying no Phi Psi brother was working at the aquatic center at that time and that they didn't hold an official social event on the weekend in question. At the time, Jackie's friends were under the impression that her date was a junior she met through her chemistry class that year. Jackie started talking about this mystery man when Randall rebuffed her romantic advances, wanting to stay friends. When she revealed that an older student in her chemistry class had been asking her out on dates,  the three friends say they took his number from her phone out of curiosity and started texting the stranger. The person they talked to wrote about 'this super smart hot' freshman and how they both shared of a love of the band Coheed and Cambria, according to the two-year-old messages shown to the Post. 'I really like this girl,' the guy said in one message. He also sent pictures of himself, showing he had a distinct jawline and blue eyes. But the messages also hinted at Jackie's crush on Randall, since the student wrote that she was interested in someone else and refused to date her. 'Get this she said she likes some other 1st year guy who dosnt (sp) like her and turned her down but she wont date me cause she likes him. She cant turn my down fro some nerd 1st yr. she said this kid is smart and funny and worth it,' the older student wrote. Eventually, Jackie told her friends that she succumbed and accepted a date from the older student for Friday, September 28, 2012. Adding even more mystery to the already confusing story, the Post identified the man in the text messages from his pictures, and it turns out he went to high school with Jackie in northern Virginia. However, that man, now a junior at a school in a different state, says he  'never really spoke with her', did not attend UVA, was not a member of any fraternity and hadn't been to Charlottesville in at least six years. On the specific weekend when Jackie  said she was raped, he was at an athletic event in a different state, and the pictures of him that were messaged to Jackie's friends appear to have been pulled from his social media accounts. Jackie's friends also had a hard time finding her crush on social media, adding that they never met him in person and now fear they had never been messaging with him in the first place. While they are skeptical of details of the night described in the Rolling Stone article, they all agree that something happened to leave Jackie terrified. 'She had very clearly just experienced a horrific trauma,' Randall said. 'I had never seen anybody acting like she was on that night before and I really hope I never have to again. ... If she was acting on the night of Sept. 28, 2012, then she deserves an Oscar. Both Randall and Andy say they've been interviewed by the Charlottesville Police, who were asked by the university to start an investigation into the alleged incident. Rolling Stone has issued an apology for the story, initially saying their trust in Jackie was 'misplaced'. They have stopped commenting on the article, while conducting an internal review. On Wednesday, the lawyer representing Jackie asked reporters to stop contacting her and her family. 'As I am sure you all can understand, all of this has been very stressful, overwhelming and retraumatizing for Jackie and her family,' Jackie's lawyer Palma Pustilnik said.","Friends identified as Randall, Cindy and Andy in the explosive article have revealed their real identities to refute key parts of 'Jackie's' story .

"More than three decades after  a bomb ripped through the crowd at Munich's world famous Oktoberfest killing 13 people, German prosecutors have reopened the investigation into the deadly far-right terrorist attack. Prompted by fresh evidence from a previously unknown female witness, investigators are hoping to shed a new light on the 1980 explosion that also injured 200 revellers at the popular beer festival. Intriguingly, they said it may point to previously unknown co-conspirators who may have worked alongside neo-Nazi bomber Gundolf Koehler, a 21-year-old student, who died during the attack. Three covered bodies after the bomb attack on the popular German beer festival. Fresh evidence from a new witness may suggest that Koehler had co-conspiators who helped him with the attack . The new witness said that within hours of the attack she found fliers hailing Koehler as a 'hero of the right' at a home she was teaching at in Silesia. According to a lawyer she spoke to, she told police at the time but they did not follow up . However, chief prosecutor Harald Range said the investigation would not be limited to the woman's evidence alone, adding that they 'will pursue all leads ... anew and comprehensively' 'There is no statute of limitations on murder,' he said. Detonated in a bin by one of the festival's exit points at the height of the Friday night rush, the improvised explosive made from a hand grenade packed with nails cut a devastating path through the happy drinkers. Koehler, described by German media at the time as a loner and a gun nut, was known to be a supporter of a neo-Nazi paramilitary group called the Hoffmann Military Sports Group. The extreme right-wing militia named after its leader Karl Heinz-Hoffman, was banned by the German government. But while the original investigation said their had been indications that others had been involved, prosecutors could find no conclusive evidence to prove this before it was shut down in 1982. Nonetheless, many victims, local politicians and lawyers have questioned the 'lone attacker' theory. Among them was lawyer, Werner Dietrich who told The New York Times that the case was reopened because of a call he had received from the new witness in September. Declining to name her, he told the paper that just hours after the bombing she found fliers lauding Koehler as a 'hero of the right' in a home where she was teaching in Silesia, a region of central Europe located mostly in Poland. She had told police at the time but they had not followed up her claims, he said, adding that he had heard a similar story from three or four men who were among the injured. Those witnesses said they had seen Koehler arguing with other people before the bomb went off. The bombing was the worst terrorist act attributed to the right wing in Germany after 1945, although throughout the 1970s and 1980s Germany saw several far-left terrorist attacks including the murder of prominent public figures and hijackings.","Ripping through the crowd the explosion killed 13 and injured around 200 .

"A  man, who is serving life  for fatally torturing the 10-month-old son of his de facto partner, received another four-year sentence for bashing the mother before kidnapping the baby boy. Mervyn Kenneth Douglas Bell was convicted after a judge-alone trial in the Western Australian Supreme Court of sexually assaulting and murdering Charles 'Charlie Boy' Mullaley in March 2013, and was sentenced in December last year to life in prison with a minimum of 27 years behind bars. On Wednesday, Bell, 27, received a further four years and 10 months in prison after pleading guilty to causing grievous bodily harm to Charlie’s mother Tamica Mullaley. Mervyn Kenneth Douglas Bell was found guilty of sexually assaulting and murdering the 10-month-old boy in December . However, Bell will not serve anymore time, as the term will run in conjunction with the murder sentencing, The West Australian reported. The night before he took the baby, Bell punched and kicked Ms Mullaley outside a neighbour's house in Broome, Western Australia and left her on the ground in a bloody mess after stripping her naked. She suffered severe bruising to her face, back and stomach, a laceration to her kidney and a badly bruised spleen. When paramedics were tending to Ms Mullaley  by police, Bell convinced a neighbour to hand over Charlie to him. Bell wanted payback for Charlie's mother humiliating him after an argument about alleged infidelities, so he took Charlie and drove almost 1000 kilometres on a very hot day. After abusing the baby for about 15 hours inflicting broken bones, burns and bruises, Bell took the boy to the Fortescue Roadhouse near Karratha but Charlie died. In her victim impact statement, Charlie's mother, Tamica Mullaley broke down in tears as she told court of her agony and how she felt powerless when she learnt what had happened to her son. 'I felt sick. How could someone do this to a child?' she said. 'My son would have been petrified.' Baby Charlie died after enduring 15 hours of torture and abuse at the hands of his mother's partner Mervyn Kenneth Douglas Bell . Ms Mullaley cried as the statement was read out to the court in December, describing her son as a happy boy who was always smiling. 'This will forever be a lifetime sentence for me. 'I feel a sense of loss and I just do not know what to do.' Instead of watching baby Charlie grow, Ms Mullaley said she had to visit his grave on his birthday. The grieving mother added that she was scared every time she saw someone who looked like Bell. Charlie's grandfather, Ted, wrote he felt guilty for not babysitting that night, and believed police let them down by responding slowly to his concerns about Charlie's safety. He said when he learnt Charlie was dead, he felt shocked and numb, adding it still tore his heart apart to think too much about his grandson. The night before he took baby Charlie from Broome, Bell assaulted the baby's mother so badly that she ended up in hospital and has now received another four-year setence for the brutal bashing . Justice John McKechnie said in sentencing that it was one of the most evil cases he had encountered. 'Once in every 10 years there comes a crime so evil that it shocks the public,' he said. Although Bell had not intended to kill the baby, his overall intention was to injure him enough to threaten his life, Justice McKechnie said. 'The fact that you did not intend death counts for little,' he said. Justice McKechnie noted that Bell had a traumatic childhood with a violent stepfather, and had some psychopathic traits, although he was not a psychopath. He added that Charlie must have been in terrible pain in his final hours. Justice McKechnie had considered imposing an indefinite jail term on Bell but said that would not be appropriate. Bell kept his head down during sentencing. Ms Mullaley was hospitalised after Bell attacked her before he fled Broome, and she still faces charges over an assault on police that night. She has demanded to know why police did not search for Charlie immediately. Police are conducting an internal investigation. Outside court, Ms Mullaley said she was satisfied with the sentence and would continue to try to be strong for the sake of her other children. Baby Charlie was left with broken bones, bruises and burns to his body . At the time of conviction, Justice McKechnie, who presided over the trial without a jury, combed through forensic evidence including graphic images of the dead baby before handing down the guilty judgement. Bell had claimed the child's injuries were caused by multiple factors, including when he fell out of a moving car travelling at about 60km/h, when the boy sat on hot rocks by a river, and when he fell into the water. But Justice McKechnie said Bell's claims the baby had fallen from a car seat were a 'lie' and that rocks had caused his burns was 'unbelievable'. Bell had showed a 'callous disregard for his health and safety', Justice McKechnie said. During the trial, the court heard the cause of death could not be ascertained, but the baby had suffered a broken arm and leg, third-degree burns on parts of his body, and severe bruising on his genitals and anus. 'It is not possible for the deceased to have injured himself,' Justice McKechnie said. 'He was not yet able to walk.' Justice McKechnie said while Bell had not intended to kill the baby, his overall intention was to threaten the child's life, which meant he was guilty of murder. The family said the loss of the baby was an 'unbearable grief' they would have to live with . The child's mother and supporters wept and cheered in court when the verdict was handed down. Bell was remanded in custody for sentencing in December, with Justice McKechnie warning him at the time that he would face a life sentence. Outside court, the baby's aunt read a statement on behalf of the family, thanking the detectives in the case but saying the local police should have acted more swiftly when the kidnapping was reported. 'Unbearable grief': The child's mother and supporters wept in court when the verdict was handed down . '(The baby's) beautiful eyes would have searched for his mother,' the aunt read. 'But he was not to know she was under custody in intensive care in Broome Hospital having just been critically bashed by Mervyn Bell and strangely arrested by Broome Police when they attended the assault. 'His eyes would have searched for his beloved Pop who, as soon as he realised he had been taken by Mervyn Bell, frantically sought help from Broome Police to find him and sadly was turned away.' The family said the loss of the baby was an 'unbearable grief' they would have to live with.","A man who fatally tortured a baby to death was jailed for life in December .

"A boy of ten has been banned from meeting his friends and hanging around shops after terrorising a community with his older brother. Alfie Hodgin, from Birkenhead, Merseyside, was given a two-year anti-social behaviour order in a bid to prevent him from causing harassment, alarm or distress to the public. The child was also ordered to leave shops and businesses when asked by staff and is also banned from associating with a group of friends in public. Alfie Hodgin (left) was given a two-year anti-social behaviour order - just weeks after his brother John (right) received a similar order . Last month, his older brother, John, 14, was himself given a criminal anti-social behaviour order at the same magistrates court. John Hodgin was accused of being part of a gang that threw missiles at vehicles and hurled abuse at vulnerable people. Within the terms of his order, the 14-year-old was banned from associating with nine of his friends in public and ordered not to cause harassment, alarm or distress. The brothers are believed to be part of a gang involved in a series of incidents in the north end of the town. Birkenhead neighbourhood inspector Duncan Swan said Alfie Hodgin's ASBO had been imposed in a bid to curb his anti-social behaviour and protect the community. He said he hoped it sent out a strong message that individuals whose behaviour affects the wider community would not be tolerated. The ASBO was issued by district judge Michael Abelson during a hearing at Wirral magistrates' court on December 1. The ASBO was issued by district judge Michael Abelson during a hearing at Wirral magistrates' court (pictured) on December 1 . It states that Alfie Hodgin must not: . - Cause harassment, alarm or distress to any person not of the same household, or shop employee or customer inside shop premises within the borough of Wirral; . - Remain in any shop, commercial or business premises when asked to leave by staff within the borough of Wirral; . - Associate in a public place or any place to which the public have access with a number of previous associates named by the court. If Hodgin does not obey any part of this order, he will commit an offence and may be fined or sent to detention for up to five years. Inspector Swan said: 'The public need to be aware of [Alfie] Hodgin's behaviour and the conditions that the court has imposed on him. 'The local community has been affected and people can now act as our eyes and ears to make sure that Hodgin lives by those conditions. 'If anyone witnesses him behaving in an anti-social manner, they are urged to pass that information on to the police. 'Breaching the conditions of an ASBO is a serious matter and I hope that this sends out a strong message that the courts and the police will not tolerate individuals whose behaviour affects the wider community. 'All the people who contributed to this application are pleased with the result, and the positive action taken by the court.'","Alfie Hodgin, 10, given two-year anti-social behaviour order by a judge .

"Scroll down for video . A copy of a 1927 Walt Disney cartoon film - thought to have been lost to the world - has been discovered in a remote part of Norway near the Arctic circle. The short movie is nearly a complete version of Empty Socks - the first Christmas film by the US entertainment giant, starring Mickey Mouse's predecessor Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. The film was found during an inventory of a facility owned by Norway's National Library in the northerly town of Mo i Rana. Discovery: A copy of a 1927 Walt Disney cartoon film - thought to have been lost to the world - has been discovered in a remote part of Norway near the Arctic circle . 'At the beginning, we didn't know it was a lost cinematographic treasure,' Kvale Soerenssen, an archivist at the library, told AFP in a statement. 'The film was in two reels which weren't clearly labelled.' The original version of 'Empty Socks' was five and a half minutes long but between 30 and 60 seconds from the middle part of the footage found in Norway are missing. The historic piece of reel has since been authenticated by Disney cartoonist David Gerstein. Iconic: The short movie is nearly a complete version of Empty Socks - the first Christmas film by Walt Disney, starring Mickey Mouse's predecessor Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Remote: The film was found during an inventory of a facility owned by Norway's National Library in the northerly town of Mo i Rana . The cartoon features Oswald, the Lucky Rabbit, a predecessor of Mickey Mouse who appeared in 26 movies by Walt Disney and his countryman Ub Iwerks. The National Library said it had digitized the short and sent a copy to the Walt Disney Company. Before this find, the only copy of 'Empty Socks' known to exist was a 25-second sequence preserved at New York's Museum of Modern Art. The Norwegian film originally belonged to a private individual, before ending up in the collection of the Norwegian Film Institute - which handed over its collection to the National Library of Norway. The majority of the library's works and documents are stored in a high-security bunker in Mo i Rana. According to Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten, the nitrocellulose reels - a highly flammable compound - are stored in a room where temperature and humidity can be controlled. The National Library has launched a large digitization project to make its collection more accessible, which has helped discover lost documents. Walt Disney, pictured in 1935, alongside Mickey Mouse who was created after Oswald the Lucky Rabbit . Along with Empty Socks, the library also found a copy of another Oswald cartoon called Tall Timber, Huffington Post reports. Made in 1928, it's one of the last Oswald films made by Disney and Iwerks, who lost the character in a contract dispute to Universal, which had been distributing the films. That ultimately led the pair to create Mickey Mouse. The Walt Disney Company eventually took back the rights to Oswald in 2006 in bizarre deal with Universal. Sportscaster Al Michaels, then under contract with Disney-owned ABC, was allowed to join Universal-owned NBC in exchange for the character.","Short movie reel is nearly a complete version of Disney's Empty Socks .

"Questions: Kristi Richardson, a 61-year-old trucking exec and grandmother, was last seen on October 6 . Police and relatives are stumped over the disappearance of a 61-year-old grandmother who vanished from her home without her purse or cell phone two months ago. All that was missing from Kristi Richardson's home when she failed to turn up for work in Casper, Wyoming on October 7 was an opener for her garage and a hooded sweatshirt. Richardson, the owner of a truck company who was recently widowed, had left her purse filled with cash and her ID on the kitchen counter. The doors were locked and nothing had been disturbed in the tidy house, which is in an affluent suburb of the city. Her family believes someone is responsible for taking her, but police do not have enough evidence to call her disappearance a crime. While authorities have released few details about the investigation, they have said they possible found traces of blood and urine found on her bed sheets, the Casper Star Tribune reported. Her cell phone was also found in her bed. 'The hard part of this case is that she is literally the only thing missing from her home,' Police Captain Steve Freel  told FoxNews.com. 'This is truly going back to 1950s police work.' Richardson, a grandmother of five, was last seen on October 6 when she drove to her daughter's home, which is on the same block, to drop off a birthday card and visit her grandchildren. Where is she? Captain Steve Freel speaks at a press conference on Thursday beside law enforcement officials members of Richardson's family as they offered a $25,000 reward for any information . Then later that day, at 7.45pm, she took a routine phone call from one of her drivers, Fox reported. But the next call to her phone at 11pm went unanswered. When she failed to go to work the following morning, her daughter, Amber Fazio, went to her mother's house using a spare garage opener but her mother was nowhere to be seen. 'Nothing was disturbed,' Fazio said, adding that the doors were all locked. 'There was no sign at all of forced entry.' Freel said they are investigating whether Richardson might have been targeted by a current or former employee of Richardson Trucking, which she had owned with her late husband since 1979. He passed away in 2013. Missed: Richardson, pictured left with her late husband and one of her daughters and son-in-laws, left her purse, which was carrying cash and her ID, on her kitchen counter when she vanished . They are also investigating competing companies but they are still not sure if a crime has been committed. Authorities and loved ones have also searched the fields surrounding her east Casper home on multiple occasions, but have come up with nothing. There have also been air searches. The possible blood and urine stains are being tested but the results are not yet available. Her daughter Amber said she is convinced her mother was taken. 'I don't think that she did this on her own,' shetold Fox. 'She never left the house without using her car. My gut tells me that someone was there before she got home.' At a press conference on Thursday, her family pleaded for information. Last seen: Her home in Casper, Wyoming, pictured, was tidy when her daughter went to look for her. Only an opener for the garage and a sweater were missing, while her cell phone and purse remained inside . 'This has obviously been an unprecedented time for our family and extremely difficult, and we would just ask anybody out there: Use your human compassion,' her daughter Tracy said. 'If you know anything about this, it would mean a lot to us if we could find out what happened to her.' Richardson's family is also offering a $25,000 reward for any information leading them to the whereabouts of their mother. The police department have set up a phone line for tips. Anyone with information is asked to call 307-235-8202. The Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation and the FBI are helping the Casper Police Department in the investigation.","Kristi Richardson was last seen on October 6 when she visited her granddaughters close to her home in Casper, Wyoming .

"Helen Earp had just returned home after the school run and glanced outside when she noticed something was seriously wrong. Leo, the family's five-year-old black and white cat, was lying lifelessly in the garden of their Northampton home. When Helen picked him up, his breathing was laboured and his body was limp. Within hours, his condition had deteriorated, so her husband James, a 37-year-old teacher, rushed him to the vet where he was kept in overnight. But, by the time James got home, Kitty, their other cat, was showing similar symptoms. James turned round and rushed back to the vet with the tabby, but nothing could be done. Leo and Kitty had to be put down. Like many cherished pets, Leo and Kitty had been a huge part of the family, which includes Jack, four, Thomas, three and Charlotte, 22 months. Their shock at the sudden deaths was compounded when Helen and James were told by the vet that their cats were victims of anti-freeze poisoning. Helen Earp (left) with surviving cat Taz had to have two cats put down due to being poisoned by antifreeze while Nicky Stephenson was thankfully able to save her cat Missey (right) who ingested the toxic chemical . Leo and Kitty are just two of a staggering 50 cats killed in Britain every month by anti-freeze, commonly used in countless car engines and to de-ice thousands of windscreens in winter. Yet it's no longer just being used to defrost vehicles, there's a growing trend among the green-fingered for adding anti-freeze to garden water features to prevent pumps and jets from frosting up and to keep the water flowing. Cats are then drinking from these ornamental pools and ingesting the de-icer. Many brands contain sweet tasting chemical ethylene glycol which is attractive to small mammals but, extremely toxic, even in small doses, and can rapidly lead to kidney failure and often a painful death. In the first four hours after being poisoned — like Leo and Kitty — cats can appear wobbly on their feet, and start drinking and urinating to excess as dehydration sets in. Cats can also become overly sleepy. As the toxin sweeps through the body over hours and sometimes days, cats will stop eating, possibly vomit and be unable to stand. If that stage has not already proved fatal, kidney failure then kicks in. According to the Veterinary Poisons Information Service, which offers vets specialist advice about poisoned pets, 90 per cent of cats who swallow anti-freeze die as a result. The number of cats dying from ethylene glycol poisoning has risen so sharply in recent years, according to Cats Protection . According to the Cats Protection charity, the number dying from ethylene glycol poisoning has risen so sharply in recent years, it has become little short of an epidemic, and the charity has been joined by other animal welfare organisations, vets and politicians in voicing concern. The problem was debated in the House of Commons earlier this month, with Environment Minister George Eustace calling for products containing ethylene glycol to be labelled with clear warnings that they could be harmful to pets. The alerts could prove a powerful deterrent for garden-lovers who are unaware that by using the substance to defrost their water features they could be inadvertantly poisoning local moggies and wildlife. The Commons debate was called by Mark Spencer, the Tory MP for Sherwood, after at least 22 cats died in Calverton, Nottinghamshire, because of it. 'The problem of anti-freeze poisoning is becoming increasingly widespread, and I can't over-emphasise what a horrific death it is for a small animal,' says Mr Spencer. While the use of anti-freeze in ornamental garden features is being blamed for a sharp rise in anti-freeze poisoning among pets in winter, some distraught cat owners — including those in the mining village of Calverton — harbour suspicions that their pets were poisoned deliberately. What is certain is that hundreds of owners, like the Earps, are being left traumatised after watching their cats dying an agonising death. 'What happened to Leo and Kitty was a terrible shock,' says Helen, 31, a full-time mother. 'I was in tears because Leo didn't want to eat or drink and was very floppy. His eyes rolled back, as though he couldn't see, which was distressing to watch. James took him to the vet, who mentioned possible anti-freeze poisoning, which shocked me. My first thought was: 'Who could do this?' 'We have another cat, Taz, and she's been fine, so it's possible it was an accident, but I don't let her out of my sight at the moment.' There's a growing trend among the green-fingered for adding anti-freeze to garden water features to prevent pumps and jets from frosting up and to keep the water flowing - which is then being ingested by cats . According to Professor Rachel Dean, of the University of Nottingham's School of Veterinary Science, accidents happen easily because it takes only a tiny amount of anti-freeze to poison cats. 'They need a much smaller dose than dogs to cause problems,' she says. 'It's possible that a cat just walking through a pool of anti-freeze and then cleaning its paws may be enough.' It's common for cats with anti-freeze poisoning to become ill so quickly that there isn't time for treatment, says Prof Dean. A lucky few can be treated with an ethanol, or alcohol, drip which acts as an antidote, although she warns: 'The earlier a cat can be treated the better, but even if treatment starts early the kidneys can still have problems.' Vets were unable to save Kerry Newlyn's 11-month-old tabby kittens, Bonnie and Clyde, when they were poisoned in July. One Sunday, Kerry, 47, who lives in Herne Bay, Kent, with her partner David Edwards and three children Nathan, 17, Aidan, 15, and Phoebe, 14, noticed Bonnie's back legs weren't working properly. Clyde also had a strange odour, which Kerry put down to him walking in fox mess. The next day, hospital worker Kerry was called by Nathan, at work, to say he was worried. 'I told him to take a taxi straight to the vet. In the afternoon, they called me to say they believed the cats had anti-freeze poisoning. They said they could try to save them, but we'd be looking at £700 per cat and it would only prolong their agony, because their kidneys had failed. 'I told the vet to put them to sleep. He said it was strange, because anti-freeze poisoning never normally happens in summer. He also said they were the fourth case they'd treated over the weekend. So I don't know what happened.' Fran Benson went through a similar ordeal with her black and white cat Cleo in October. Fran, 46, a writer from Liphook, Hampshire, was at home with her husband Ian, 46, a golf professional, and their children, Sam, 12, Jack, seven and Poppy, six, when Cleo became ill. 'I found Cleo lying on the doormat, panting for breath and retching. I knew instinctively she was dying. I realised there wasn't time to get her to the vet, and I didn't want her to die in the car, so I made her as comfortable as I could.' Twenty minutes later Cleo was dead. 'It was awful because there was nothing I could do', says Fran. 'She kept convulsing and bit through her tongue.' Later, Fran looked up her symptoms online and found they matched anti-freeze poisoning. Nicky and Paul Stephenson's kitten Missey is one of the lucky few to have survived anti-freeze poisoning. When she came home one night in October soaking wet, the couple from Redcar, North Yorkshire, towelled her dry. But next morning she was sick so they rushed her to the vet. 'They told us it was anti-freeze poisoning and they didn't think she was going to survive,' says Nicky. 'We didn't want her to suffer, so agreed to put her down. 'But a visiting vet suggested trying a vodka drip, because the ethanol can neutralise the poisonous effects.' Missey was transferred to a surgery in Middlesbrough, where the alcohol was administered over two days. 'She was noticeably drunk, with her eyes out of focus, but it worked. After a few days in intensive care we were allowed to take her home with tablets to combat the damage to her kidneys,' says Nicky. 'It was touch and go for about ten days, but now she's back to normal.' The £2,000 cost was met by their pet insurance. Experts advise anybody who thinks their cat might have ingested anti-freeze to seek veterinary help as soon as possible — but it's clear that a better solution needs to be found. Mark Spencer is campaigning for the Government to make it mandatory for anti-freeze products to include Bitrex — a substance which makes harmful products unpalatable. But Cats Protection point out that there's no evidence to suggest cats would be put off by a bitter taste. 'Bittering agents are not the answer, or at least not the whole answer,' says their advocacy manager, Jacqui Cuff. 'We are concerned that seeing the addition of a bittering agent on an anti-freeze label may give pet-owning purchasers the false impression that the product is safe. 'In the longer term, we'd like to see anti-freeze manufacturers developing alternative non-toxic products.' In the meantime, says Prof Dean: 'If you use anti-freeze, don't use one with ethylene glycol in it and tell others about the risks.' Her words would no doubt be echoed by owners of cats that have perished in this horrific way.","Helen Earp lost two cats in one night after they drank the toxic chemical .
Cat deaths from anti-freeze have risen to almost epidemic proportions .
Sweet taste is attractive to animals but can lead to kidney failure and death .

"What do you first notice about them? Jackets and ties, hair for the most part well-trimmed and almost all shoes respectfully shone. Were it not for the guitar in the centre it could be any group of young Sixties male office workers and pretty shorthand typists celebrating a collective Pools win. But look a little closer. Isn’t that Mick Jagger next to Keith Richards, letting the side down with their longish hair and louche jumpers in the bottom left-hand corner; over on the right there’s fellow Rolling Stones Bill Wyman and dandy Brian Jones. Where’s drummer Charlie Watts? Oh, yes, up there in the back row, as glum as ever. And the girl in the leather coat who looks like the boss’s secretary? Surprise, surprise, it’s Cilla Black — not long out of the typing pool and a star for less than six months. Scroll down for video . The golden generation: The creme de la creme of Sixties British pop come together before Ready Steady Go's Rave Mad Mod Ball in April 1964. Above photograph from 'British Pop Invasion: How British music conquered the sixties, edited by Alan J Whiticker (New Holland Publishers) Then there’s the young lady with the fringe on the other side of the guitar who seems to be cowering from the attentions of the three youths around her? It’s Cathy McGowan, 50 years ago the dizziest, most envied, best-connected girl in Britain as the co-presenter of TV’s Ready Steady Go. ‘The weekend starts here,’ the show boasted, but for millions it was the Sixties that started there on ITV, every Friday night with its organised chaos of live music, ordinary kids dancing and the sheer essence of being young. It was April 1964, and this photo captured rehearsals for the Ready Steady Go Rave Mad Mod Ball at the Empire Pool Wembley. And, with the exception of The Beatles, who four days earlier had overwhelmed America by having the top five records there, nearly all of the beat boom stars are here, a first crop of what would soon be a golden generation of British pop stars. There’s Paul Jones, still with Manfred Mann, Freddie And The Dreamers and Sounds Incorporated. Most dominant are the Merseybeat acts, like Cilla herself, and all the others from Liverpool’s Cavern Club, the Searchers, the aptly-named Merseybeats and heartthrob Billy J. Kramer with his Dakotas and the Fourmost, both of whom got John Lennon’s cast-off songs that weren’t good enough for The Beatles. And what a conservative-looking crowd of kids they were, or, should we say, gang of boys, because pop then was an overwhelmingly male profession. With the exception of Cilla and Cathy, the only other non-male is blonde-haired Kathy Kirby, she of the shiny lips and tight dresses, who seems to be in conversation with Keith Fordyce, the show’s other presenter. 1 Mike Millward, guitar and vocals for the Fourmost. He died from leukaemia in 1966. 2 Mike Maxfield, lead guitar for Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas. Later suffered a stroke but still involved with the band behind the scenes. 3 Robin MacDonald, bass guitar for the Dakotas. No longer involved with music. 4 Billy Hatton, bass guitar for the Fourmost. Now seen on YouTube giving guitar lessons and talking about the Merseybeat boom. 5 Charlie Watts, still drumming for the Rolling Stones after all these years. 6 Chris Curtis, drummer for the Searchers. Left the band in 1966. Died in 2005. 7 Dave Lovelady, drummer for the Fourmost. Their first hit was the John Lennon song Hello Little Girl, which Lennon didn’t think good enough for The Beatles. 8 Griff West, tenor saxophone and flute for Sounds Incorporated —one of the great backing groups of the Sixties. 9 Tony Newman, drums for Sounds Incorporated. Became a top session player, working with David Bowie, Crystal Gayle, the Everly Brothers, and on the rock musical Tommy. 10 Brian O’Hara, lead guitar with the Fourmost. Died in 1999. Cilla Black (left), who went from Liverpool’s Cavern to TV presenting and national treasure status, and the legendary Mick Jagger (right) 11 Aaron Williams, guitarist with the Merseybeats. Now retired from music and still living in Liverpool. 12 John Banks, drummer for the Merseybeats. Died 1988. 13 Mike Hugg, drummer with Manfred Mann. Now plays keyboards with reformed Manfreds. 14 Patrick Kerr, dancer and co-presenter on Ready, Steady, Go! Famous for demonstrating the latest dance 'moves' for eager viewers. 15 Paul Jones, vocals/harmonica, Manfred Mann. Went solo in 1966.Starred alongside Jean Shrimpton in the movie Privilege. Now back with the reformed Manfreds. 16 Keith Richards, lead guitarist for the Rolling Stones. Seemingly indestructible. 17 Mick Jagger. What more can we say? 18 Manfred Mann, jazz musician and founding member of the Manfreds. Now lives partly in Sweden and has his own band. 19 Kenny Lynch, East Ender who was one of the first black UK singers to achieve success. Also a songwriter, he is still a lively raconteur, TV personality and occasional actor. 20 Peter Birrell, bass guitar for Freddie and the Dreamers. Later became a taxi driver. Charlie Watts (left), still drumming for the Rolling Stones - and the only one not smiling in the photo - and singer Kathy Kirby (right), who died in 2011 . 21 Tony Jackson, bass player with the Searchers.

Now retired and living in Hyde, Greater Manchester. 39 John McNally, Searchers guitarist. Still touring with the band. 40 Bernie Dwyer, drummer with Freddie and the Dreamers. Died in 2002. The Fourmosts: (From left to right) Mike Millward, Dave Lovelady, Brian O'Hara and Billy Hatton . Fordyce was ancient in comparison with the others. Thirty-five, if he was a day, even older than Kenny Lynch, the only non-white artist, who was already 26. The prevailing general image of the Sixties today is a colourful time of flowing hair entwined with flowers, of bells, beads and flares and Regency-styled suits. Well, perhaps it was by 1967, but not in 1964. The tab collars and tight-across-the-crutch trousers may suggest Carnaby Street, and the Chelsea boots, with built-up heels in Mick Jagger’s case to give him an extra 2in of height, were probably Anello & Davide, who were the cobblers to the groovy back then. But there isn’t a pair of blue jeans in sight. Showing how rich you were, how anti-Establishment and intelligent by donning denim was yet to arrive. And now: Mick Jagger (left) pictured in concert in June this year and Cilla Black (right), who had a TV biopic earlier this year . Still going strong: The seemingly indestructible lead guitarist for the Rolling Stones, Keith Richards, pictured performing in May this year . Cathy McGowan (right), the breathless young presenter on Ready Steady Go, with her long-term partner, singer Michael Ball (left) Charlie Watts (left) performing at the O2 and Manfred Mann (right) looking slightly different from his Sixties heydey . And at least half the performers here haven’t adopted a trailblazing Beatle moptop. Shoulder-length hair on men was years away. As for moustaches and beards, they were for old men (OK, Manfred Mann has a neatly-trimmed beard, but he was a reconstituted jazzer, and therefore cerebral.) The people in this photo might have been going to a charity mod ball, but there isn’t much that was particularly mod or even modish about them. Casual smart was the style for stepping out in then, whether it was going to work, to the local youth club or to appear on TV. These guys probably wouldn’t have had many more ‘best’ clothes anyway, because what we see here, with only one or two exceptions (yes you, Bill Wyman), is a generation of grown-up war babies. Thrilled by their good luck, they are young and mainly working class, born in the bomb-threatened early Forties and brought up and educated in Fifties austerity. When this photo was taken, they were mainly in their early 20s and just about to be part of an explosion of opportunities to which their talents and the times gave them a kind of life their parents’ generation could never have imagined. No wonder — Charlie Watts aside — they looked so happy. And I bet even he was smiling inside.","The group of 40 British pop stars posed for the photo in April 1964 ahead of the ball at the Empire Pool Wembley .

"A 20-month-old baby died in hospital after she was prescribed an 'exceptionally high' dose of potassium while recovering from a 'textbook' operation, an inquest was told. Willow Kemp suffered a heart attack after undergoing a number of procedures, including a gastrostomy, at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. The inquest heard that medics who were responsible for her care failed to check her blood levels for three-and-half hours as she recovered in the hospital's intensive care unit. Willow Kemp suffered a heart attack after undergoing the procedure at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. Her parents, Debbie and Oliver, (pictured) told doctors that their daughter looked 'peaky', the inquest heard . Willow died in June 2012, just moments after her parents, Debbie and Oliver Kemp, had voiced concerns that their daughter appeared to be struggling to breathe, the inquest heard. The toddler suffered from a number of complex illnesses including cardiac and respiratory problems that meant her potassium levels had previously fluctuated wildly. In response, a pharmacist prepared a large dose of potassium. He told the inquest that he had never dealt with such high concentrations in his whole career. But staff admitted that they then did not check Willow's blood levels again for a number of hours, despite the unusually high dosage. Potassium, a mineral that the body needs to work normally, helps nerves and muscles communicate. It also helps move nutrients into cells and waste products out of cells. A normal potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.5millimoles per litre. However Willow had a history of fluctuating levels - with readings ranging from 1.8 to as high as 8mmol/l being taken in the month before her death. Willow Kemp, pictured, suffered from a number of complex medical conditions including respiratory and cardiac problems before she died . Willow's first potassium reading on 28 June was of 5.7mmol/l. Shortly after, her parents described her as looking 'peaky' and said she was struggling to breathe as she lay in her mother's arms. When her father Oliver Kemp, a radio DJ, from Bamber Bridge, Lancashire, alerted the nurse to his daughter's condition, she called a physiotherapist for assistance and her blood gas was taken again. The test revealed that her potassium level had shot up to 8.3mmol/l and her situation became critical. The baby slipped into cardiac arrest and, despite frantic attempts to resuscitate her, was pronounced dead a short time later. It was later discovered that she had a huge 11mmol/l of potassium in her blood at the time of death. At an inquest into her death in Manchester yesterday, Mr Kemp broke down in tears as he relived the moment he was told that hyperkalaemia - a high potassium concentration - contributed to his daughter's death. He said: 'The procedure, we were told, was 'textbook' and she would make a full recovery. 'When we arrived back at the hospital Willow  was in the cot and looked very uncomfortable, her breathing appeared laboured, she had white secretions on her mouth and she appeared to be hot to the touch. 'Before the cardiac arrest my wife was holding Willow on her lap and I was beside her and the consultant came to the cubicle. 'At that point I decided to ask about what I was seeing on the heart monitor screen. He had come to look at the chart. I said to him 'is that correct, does that look right to you?' 'He looked at her and at the heart monitor and he said something to the effect of, ""yes, she does look very peaky, could you please put her back on the bed"". 'We left the cubicle after we gave her a kiss and we knew something was wrong because the voices started to get louder. More members of staff came and we were told she had died.' Dr Robert Yates, a consultant paediatrician at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, said Willow's body would deal with potassium differently to anything he had ever seen. Willow's blood readings were taken for a second time after her father Oliver Kemp, a radio DJ, from Bamber Bridge, Lancashire, alerted the nurse to his daughter's condition. Above, Oliver with wife Debbie and Willow . Willow had a history of fluctuating potassium levels even when she was stable, the inquest was told. The body needs the mineral to work normally, as it helps nerves and muscles communicate . He said: 'This was a little girl who had widely fluctuating levels even when stable and well. 'The concentration and quantity that she received wasn't directly proportional to the potassium in her blood. 'I have been a consultant for 18 years and have never seen a child with such fluctuating levels of potassium.' When asked by Andrew Bridgman, representing Willow's family, whether it would be 'prudent' to monitor Willow's levels frequently because of their unusual results, Dr Yates said: 'Yes, but where it was practical to do so, given the other cares for her going on. 'I was happy with them being taken every ninety minutes to two hours and was happy she had previously tolerated a high level of potassium which was outside our normal experience.' Dr Adam Southern, a senior clinical pharmacist at the hospital, constructed the potassium mixture to be used in the two infusion bags administered to Willow. He said: 'This is the first time in my professional career I have needed to make a solution like that.' Staff nurse Stacey Cain, who was responsible for Willow's care on the intensive care unit that day, admitted she should have checked her potassium levels more regularly while such a large amount was being administered. However, she said she hadn't been given any specific instructions as to how often they should be taken. She said: 'One should be taken every two hours, but circumstances wouldn't allow it.' Dr Robert Ross-Russell, a consultant paediatrician from Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, was asked by coroner Nigel Meadows to prepare a report on Willow's care as an expert witness. He said: 'It was an exceptionally high concentration of potassium. I have used it once or twice but never in a child so small in age or in terms of weight. It is an extraordinary situation you are in. 'The decision to move up from 6-12mmol per hour was a bold one and a risky one. Staff nurse Stacey Cain, who was responsible for Willow's care on the intensive care unit at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital (pictured), admitted she should have checked her potassium levels more regularly . I don't think it was unreasonable to do given the difficulties they had in controlling the potassium but it was a very substantial rise in the amount being given. 'I think my feeling was if one is going to undertake risks they have to be very careful and monitor them. 'There was a need for regular monitoring. When the blood gas was taken at 4.51pm it should have raised significant concern and alarm because it is a substantial jump up.' He conceded that the registrar's fell below the standard expected as the infusion wasn't immediately stopped and issues weren't raised with the consultant doctor on duty. Coroner Nigel Meadows earlier acknowledged that the family have received admissions from the NHS trust about the potassium levels - which the family do not accept as going 'far enough' in determining responsibility for Willow's death. The inquest continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Willow Kemp was given potassium after 'textbook operation'

"Questions: Jessica Chambers, 19, was found with burns on 98 per cent of her body on Saturday night . Police have added $10,000 to the reward for information that explains how and why a teenager was burned alive in a rural road in Mississippi last weekend. Jessica Chambers, 19, was inexplicably doused with gasoline and set on fire on Saturday night. She was found barely alive by passers-by and died in hospital later that evening, with burns to 98 per cent of her body. At a press conference on Thursday, District Attorney John Champion said they have spoken to 'many, many' people  but still feel like there is still a lot they do not know. Now, as Chambers' family prepares for her funeral, the US Marshals Service has announced $11,000 will be handed to the person that can offer crucial information. 'There's just not a lot of street talk out there about who may or may not have done it,' he said. 'We feel like somebody out there has heard something.' Speaking with Assistant District Attorney Jay Hale, they said there were some rumors circulating that were not true, including that Chambers was still on fire when she was found. But it has emerged that the killer apparently got into the car before setting it alight. The teenager also had a large gash on her head. To piece together the last few hours of her life, investigators continue to pore over surveillance footage from a gas station where she was seen 90 minutes before her death. They are also looking at her cell phone, which was left behind at the scene. 'We're leaving no stone unturned at this point,' Champion added. 'This is an absolute horrendous case... This situation is about as bad as it comes.' Last moments: Jessica Chambers, 19, was caught on surveillance footage just 90 minutes before she was burned alive along the side of a rural road on Saturday. She is seen walking towards the store . Caught on camera: Jessica (seen left) then went into the shop and paid while three men chatted nearby . Scene: The gas station and convenience store Jessica visited before she was found severely burned along the side of a nearby road. The cashier claims Jessica told him she was 'going somewhere' The gas station surveillance footage shows her climbing out of her car, walking across the forecourt and stopping to wave at a friend, before walking off camera. She then returns to the store to pay. Convenience store manager Ali Fadhel, who served the teenager, told the Associated Press that Chambers came in frequently and he would often speak with her. According to Fadhel, Chambers was wearing a dark-colored sweater and pajama pants that looked like sweatpants. Chambers said she was going to make a stop before going home, Fadhel said. 'If she knew she had a problem with somebody, she would have told me,' Fadhel said. Chambers bought $14 worth of gas, more than the $5 or so she usually purchased, he said. 'I asked her, ""Why are you putting so much gas?"" She said, ""I'm going somewhere"",' Fadhel said. Authorities have not commented on the claims. On her way out, Chambers got a call on her cellphone, Fadhel said. When she left, she headed south on Highway 51, he said. Questions: While she was inside, a man (seen top right) filled up a gas can close to her car (the dark vehicle in the center) but he has been cleared. After going inside the shop, she drove off . Terrifying: She had told her mother she was going out to get food when she and her car were set alight . Crime scene: Yellow crime scene tape marks the location where the 19-year-old  was found severely burned. Authorities are working to piece together the last hours of her life in efforts to catch who set her on fire . Grisly discovery: The teenager was barely conscious when first responders arrived to her car, which was on this bank, and she managed to whisper something - but authorities have not revealed what she said . About 90 minutes later, a motorist called 911 to report a burning car a mile away and first responders arrived to find the burned young woman. She was not covered in flames, as previously reported, authorities said at the press conference. She whispered something to one of the fire officers. Investigators have not revealed what she said but indicated that the final words may help find her killer, WMC reported. 'She was able to communicate. It was difficult,' said Jay Hale, an assistant district attorney who prosecutes cases in Panola County. Peter Odom, an attorney who has prosecuted some arson cases, told HLN's 'Nancy Grace' that investigators will be assessing the physical appearance of suspects. 'They're looking for someone with singed eyebrows and maybe burned hands. Because the burner often gets burned,' he said. Plea: District Attorney John Champion pleaded for information as he spoke at a press conference on Thursday . Tragic: Two years before Jessica's death, her older brother Ben (right) was killed in a car crash . Authorities said initial autopsy results reveal the girl died from severe burns that covered 98 per cent of her body. 'I mean it's bad,' DA John Champion told Fox. 'I have been doing this for 21 years and as far as the means of death it is certainly the worst I have dealt with.' Authorities are also looking into reports that she went to a party before her death, but they have said her appearance - pajama trousers and her hair in a bun - suggests she did not attend the party. Friends said that the family can't think of anyone that might have wanted to hurt Jessica, who didn't have a boyfriend and was not known to have been seeing anyone. They added that she had just started a new job at Goody's Department Store, which she loved. Lisa Chambers, the girl's mother, begged with anyone to come forward with any information they may have about the heinous crime. Heartbroken: Her mother, Lisa Chambers, sobbed as she pleaded with the public for information . Ripped apart: Her father Ben, pictured right, has also appealed for any information in her death . 'They have ripped everything I have,' she told Fox. 'She left to go clean out her car and was going to get [herself] something to eat.' Amanda Prince, who identified herself as Jessica Chambers' older sister, told CNN Wednesday night that the family is 'shocked, lost ... confused, angry, hurt.' Asked if she knew of anyone who had a grudge against her sister or might want to hurt her, Prince replied, 'No one. She was loved by everybody. I don't know who would want to do this or why.' Mississippi authorities say they have received offers to help from several agencies, including the U.S. attorney's office and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. A candle-lit vigil will be held for Jessica on Saturday. Anyone with information on the murder should contact the Sheriff's Office at 662-563-6230.

"A grandmother is a person of interest in a police investigation into the 'mindboggling' murders of two of her grandchildren and the attempted killing of two other grandkids by fire as they slept in their beds. The crimes all occurred at the same home in Morayfield, on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland's south, on the 27th day of three different months. Detectives said the children's grandmother was present at each incident. No one has been charged. The deaths of a three-year-old child, who was found at the home on July 27 2013, and a seven-month-old, who was found dead at the same address on September 27 2014, were initially treated as SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) cases, police said.

"President Barack Obama is under fire this week for the way his White House has excoriated the previous administration for employing tactics it would categorize as torture all the while launching drone strikes on terrorism suspects abroad. The enhanced interrogation techniques used by the CIA during the George W. Bush administration on 39 detainees resulted in just one death, Obama's critics have pointed out. Drone strikes conducted by the current occupant of the White House have killed more than 2,400 people. After claiming all week that the release of a Senate Intelligence Committee report detailing the brutal tactics employed by the Bush administration to elicit information from terrorists was necessary in order for the U.S. to reassert it's 'moral authority,' the White House was forced on Friday to state on record that it doesn't believe its drone policy erodes the moral high ground on which it thinks it stands when it comes to human rights. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Barack Obama and his administration have been aggressively criticized this week over the number of civilians its drone strikes kill . Charges of hypocrisy were levied at the Obama administration this week by a former director of the CIA’s National Clandestine Service, Jose Rodriguez, on Tuesday evening after the Senate committee's published its review of the so-called torture program, operated from 2002 - 2007. Appearing on Sean Hannity's Fox News program that evening, Rodriguez and the conservative television host chastised the Obama administration for its own questionable anti-terrorism tactics. Hannity wondered how the Obama administration's drone program is 'not far more morally problematic than enhanced interrogation' to the Democratic chairwoman of the Senate's Intelligence Committee. 'This administration does not take any prisoners, they prefer to kill them from afar, using drones,' Rodriguez chimed in. 'And somehow, they feel that because they kill from a distance, somehow, it’s more ethical … more ethical than the difficult and messy and unpleasant task and mission of actually interrogating prisoners,' he continued, adding, 'I think it’s a distortion of what our values are.' Hannity went on to say that if he had to choose between being waterboarded, one of the approved interrogation tactics of the Bush administration's CIA, or being droned, he'd prefer to be waterboarded. 'I think I’ll take the waterboarding, too,' Rodriguez replied. While waterboarding has been the most commonly cited enhanced interrogation technique since Obama banned the use of the harsh tactics during his first days in office, its one of 13 on the list that the CIA used at the time. Others include sleep deprivation, cramped confinement, nudity and stress positions. Unapproved tactics that the the Bush administration says the CIA used without authorization were rectal feeding and a process referred to in the report as 'rectal rehydration.' A young Yazidi refugee stuck on Mount Sinjar cries in this November photo after a gauntlet of older and stronger refugees pushed their way onto an Iraqi Air Force Mi-17 Hip helicopter sent to evacuate them. The White House pushed back on criticism this week that its drone strikes against terrorists kill thousands of innocents by pointing out that ISIS' terror tactics kill substantially more . Taking the argument against the Obama administration drone policies a step further on Wednesday morning former Republican congressman and current MSNBC host Joe Scarborough said present U.S. policy appears to be: 'Let’s just go ahead and just kill them all, and if we kill 5-year-old girls and 85-year-old grandmas, so be it; we feel better about ourselves because that seems cleaner. 'That’s what liberals are saying today,' he charged. 'That’s what [Vice President] Joe Biden’s been saying, that’s what Barack Obama’s been saying.' Continuing, he claimed 'the drone program went into overdrive on January 21st, 2009' when Obama took office. 'When you talk about five years from now, ten years from now, the information comes out about this drone program, and people actually report on this drone program, it’s going to look a hell of a lot worse, a hell of a lot deadlier, a hell of a lot more random, and a hell of a lot more inhumane than waterboarding three prisoners in 2002 and 2003,' he said. On Friday Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest was confronted about the possibility that this White House's drone policies would be disparaged by a future administration with as much hostility as the current one is showing the Bush era program. Earnest told the inquiring reporter, SiriusXm radio's Jared Rizzi, he 'would not envision a scenario where that would occur.' 'Letal operations, lethal counterterrorrism operations, are only conducted as a last resort,' he said, 'and the president has emphasized that extraordinary care needs to be taken' to ensure that such counterterrorism measures are 'carried out in accordance with all applicable domestic and international laws, and are consistent with U.S. values and policy.' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said on Friday he doesn't think the Obama administration's drone policy undermines its self-proclaimed 'moral authority' After stating that '40x more' people 'are affected by drones than held in Guantanamo,' Rizzi then asked Earnest if 'the animating principle here' is 'if the president does it, it is not illegal?' A visibly irritated Earnest told him, 'No, I think the animating principle here is that the president is committed, in fact, to upholding both American and international law and ensuring that all of the actions that are taken are consistent with our values and our policy. 'Those values are what uphold our moral authority around the globe, and that's why the president is determined to ensure that our counterterrorism operations are consistent with those values,' Earnest said, restating already established administration policy that the United States' 'moral authority'  is one of the 'most powerful tools' in its 'arsenal to protecting American interests around the globe.' Rizzi pressed the Obama administration further and asked him any aspect of the White House's drone policy undermines its self proclaimed moral authority, at which point Earnest again stressed that 'great precautions are taken' to make sure that innocents are not killed in U.S. drone strikes. Backing him into a corner, the White House correspondent repeated his question. 'No,' Earnest curtly said before moving on to another reporter's questions. Earlier this week Earnest faced a similar cross-examination of administration policy from Fox News' senior White House correspondent, Ed Henry. 'You have repeatedly talked about moral authority,' Henry said. 'So can you explain how the president believes that it’s un-American to use these [enhanced interrogation] techniques, but it’s OK to ramp up the drone policy and basically thousands of people across the world, innocent civilians were killed? 'What’s the moral equivalency there? How do you have moral authority when innocent civilians are killed by drones?' Henry asked. Earnest told him there's a 'stark difference in the way the United States conducts our policy, and the way that terrorists around the world conduct their policy,' stating the strict precautions taken. 'I understand there are safeguards,' Henry said. 'But in the end, we’ve seen many cases around the world where U.S. drones have killed innocent civilians despite those safeguards. So how do you have moral authority?' he again asked. 'What I’m saying is that is a stark difference from the tactics that are employed by our enemies, who seek to use car bombs to actually target innocent civilians,' Earnest said, adding that the U.S goes 'to great lengths to protect the lives of innocent civilians.' 'In fact, many of the terrorists that we’re talking about, and again, many of these counterterrorism activities that are used against terrorists are targeting terrorists that themselves have targeted local populations, that have targeted fellow Muslims in some situations. 'So the efforts that are taken by this administration to limit or to prevent innocent civilian casualties are consistent with our values, and are consistent with our broader strategy for protecting the American people,' he contended. Asked on Wednesday whether the U.S. still has any moral high ground left in light of the Senate's damning report on the Bush era programs, released the day before, a top U.S. general that oversees the operations at terrorist-holding prison Guantanamo Bay made a similar argument. “I would say that people who said to me, ""Well, we have now lost the moral high ground,"" I think that’s foolishness,' Marine Gen. John F. Kelly, the chief of U.S. Southern Command told attendees of a human rights summit, per a report in the Washington Post. 'Some might say that. The jihadists were saying it today,' he noted. 'Gimme a break. [The Islamic State] is telling us we lost the moral high ground? I love it.'","The CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, used on 39 detainees, resulted in just one death, Obama's critics have pointed out .

"Snatched from the Regents Park townhouse of the Marks and Spencer’s heiress in a daring heist, it was lost for more than four decades. The £25 million Gauguin masterpiece hung on the wall of a former Fiat factory worker for 40 years before he realised its true value and reported it to the police. Now the Sicilian shift worker who unearthed Fruit on a Table or Small Dog, by Paul Gauguin, has been allowed to keep the painting, and it has returned to pride of place on his kitchen wall. A court ruled a pensioner, 70, could keep the £25million Gauguin masterpiece, which he paid the equivalent of £19 for 1970 . The anonymous pensioner bought the painting for 45,000 lire, or £19, along with a Bonnard, also stolen from the London home of Mathilda Marks in 1970. The paintings then travelled across Europe by train before coming up for sale at the railway lost property auction in Turin in 1975. Many years later the man's art student son noticed the painting's similarity to Gauguin's other works and made enquiries with art police. Now, after no one claimed the paintings, a court in Rome has ruled that he could keep both the £25million Gauguin and Woman with Two Chairs, by Pierre Bonnard, thought to be worth £500,000. Italian culture minister Dario Franceschini, left, and General of Carabinieri Mariano Mossa in front of the two paintings stolen in London in the 1970s by French artists Paul Gauguin and Pierre Bonnard . The pensioner, now 70, whose name is protected by Italian law, said he would finally be able to take his wife on a honeymoon they had never been able to afford ‘from Trieste to Vienna’. He also wants to buy a farm in his native Sicily- and splash out on some more paintings. He told La Repubblica he didn’t expect to keep the works. ‘But now I feel like a citizen who has done his duty.' He remembered: 'When I brought them home from the auction I thought ""I don't care who painted them. They are beautiful."" 'Don't ask me why I liked them. It was intuition.' The paintings were found in April this year, 44 years after three conmen managed to convince a London housekeeper that they were carrying out security checks. One posed as a policeman, while his two accomplices pretended to be fitting a new burglar alarm. They took the paintings from their frames while the housekeeper was making them a cup of tea. A Carabinieri stands guard next to the two paintings stolen in a daring heist in London in the 1970s . Investigators found the painting still hanging in the kitchen and began a painstaking search to discover its real owners. After trawling through back catalogues of exhibitions they read about the disappearance of the 1889 Gauguin and traced the paintings to Mathilda Marks and her husband, author Terence Kennedy. Both have now died, leaving no children. The Metropolitan police say there have not been able to trace the owners nor have their been any claims on the painting in the UK.","Sicilian shift worker had Fruit on a Table or Small Dog for 40 years before he realised its true value .

"New York Citi Bike riders are at risk according to a new audit exposing spotty maintenance checks, poor cleanliness and defective docking stations. Comptroller Scott Stringer released his report Thursday looking at if New York City Bike Share, which manages the scheme, is in compliance with its Department of Transport contract. According to maintenance data, only 28per cent of the 6,000 two-wheelers in Manhattan and Brooklyn were inspected in November 2013, 34per cent in December 2013 and 38per cent in January 2014. Transportation hazard: New York Citi Bike riders are at risk according to a new audit, exposing spotty maintenance checks, poor cleanliness and defective parking stations . 'With every missed maintenance check, the safety risk of undisclosed bike defects increases,' Stringer said. Common defects were said to include missing or broken seats and pedals, flat tires and damaged wheel rims. Of the 29 docking stations sampled in February 2013, the audit showed that only 11 were inspected as required and the remaining 18 were inspected less than twice a week or not at all. And while the contract requires a response to cleanliness complaints within 48 hours for stations, and 96 hours for bikes, the audit found only 60per cent of the sampled complaints for stations were completed within the required time frame. Of the bike cleanliness complaints, 83per cent remained open for an average of 79 days. In addition to problems with maintenance, cleanliness and docking stations, the audit  found stations with disconnected credit-card machines. The accompanying mobile application was also revealed to be unreliable, and in many cases did not reflect the actual number of physically available bikes and open docks. As of last August, Citi Bike riders took about 34,000 rides per day, making the program what Stringer calls a 'critical component of our transportation network.' Shoddy maintenance: According to data, only 28per cent of the 6,000 two-wheelers in Manhattan and Brooklyn were inspected in November 2013, 34per cent in December 2013 and 38per cent in January 2014 . However, the comptroller said improvements must be made to comply with the New York City Department of Transportation. 'New York City Bike Share's management of Citi Bike left too many New Yorkers in the lurch,' Stringer said. 'While Citi Bike has become part of our urban landscape, auditors found that the bike sharing program's spotty maintenance, poorly-cleaned bikes and substandard docking stations inconvenienced riders and discouraged growth in the system.' The private program is named for Citigroup, which spent $41 million to be its lead sponsor. The Bikeshare Holdings company recently announced its plan to purchase Alta Bicycle Share, the parent company of New York City Bike Share - promising an infusion of capital for improvements. In addition, plans are in the works to expand the City Bike system. New York City Bike Share cited worker layoffs and staffing issues to explain many of the problems exposed in Stringer's audit. The investigation ran from May 27 2013 through May 31 2014.","Comptroller Scott Stringer released his report Thursday .

"It seemed a very daunting yuletide challenge; could I find an exciting, quality array of presents to satisfy even the most fussy of school children for a total of just $150? In previous years, shopping for our two children, aged four and six, is usually done in bursts of frenzied grabs at our local mall between food shopping and scavenging around for presents for teachers. In short, I've probably over spent amid the rush and my lack of planning and regretting it in January when the credit card bill lands heavily in the mailbox. A Daily Mail reporter was sent on a quest to find a quality array of presents to satisfy school children for a total of $150. The cheapest being board game Line Up 4, at Kmart, for $6 . Other potential gifts include Mr Tickle (left) ceramic mug with toffees, Coles, $5 and Mini Movie Collection (right), Despicable Me & Despicable Me 2, Coles, $5 . 61 Key Kids Keyboard, ALDI, which costs $16.99 was the most expensive Christmas present on the list . It's the same financial hangover for many, with shoppers predicted by the Australian National Retailers Association to spend at least $6.5 billion in the shops this year and a further billion on online gifts. So this venture for Daily Mail Australia was quite the revelation. I had a strict budget and a tight deadline; it was time to switch off my phone for once and focus. And in just a few hours at Westfield Southland, in Cheltenham which is southeast of Melbourne, I was amazed to find an exciting mix of presents in many of the major stores including Target, Big W, Kmart, ALDI, Coles and Rebel Sport. Rather than just diving into the toy aisles and aiming mindlessly for the well known expensive brands, the exercise made me also look carefully in the less obvious areas such as sports and camping. And what gems I found, many of which may well inspire the whole family during the lengthy summer school holidays. The Inflatable raft boat with oars, which can be found at Kmart, retailing for $15 . Wilson tennis balls (left), Rebel Sport, $8 for five and Piping Hot Bodyboard, Target, for $8 . Pulse portable mini Bluetooth speaker (left), Big W, $15 and Cupcake Maker (right), Target, $12 . Zinc scooter, Target, which usually retails for $19 but currently has 20 per cent off which brings the cost down to $15.20 . 1) Kid's Science Metal Detector, Kmart, $20 . 2) 61 Key Kids Keyboard, ALDI, $16.99 . 3) Zinc scooter, Target, (usually $19 but currently has 20 per cent off) $15.20 . 4) Pulse portable mini Bluetooth speaker, Big W, $15 . 5) Line Up 4, Kmart, $6 . 6) Mini Movie Collection, Despicable Me & Despicable Me 2, Coles, $5 . 7) Height Adjustable Tennis, Big W, $12 . 8) Cupcake Maker, Target, $12 . 9) Kids Sport Fishing Rod, Kmart, $10 . 10) Piping Hot Bodyboard, Target, $8 . 11) Wilson tennis balls x5, Rebel Sport, $8 . 12) Mr Tickle ceramic mug with toffees, Coles,  $5 . 13) Inflatable raft boat with oars, Kmart, $15 . TOTAL: $148.19 . From inflatable boats and keyboards to cup cake makers and fishing rods. All suitable for both boys and girls, with the added benefits of several prices reduced as the major stores compete fiercely for our Christmas dollars. It soon became clear sticking to a strict budget doesn't mean a dreary Christmas for the children. Far from it. These gifts will mean a huge pile of presents to unwrap and may even turn into some fun new hobbies. The metal detector gift alone will potentially amuse the kids for hours at the beach. It also turned out some major retailers are doing their own brand version of classic toys such as Connect Four - at quarter of the price. Particularly Kmart with their 'Line Up 4' game at just $6. Our children may just have their best Christmas (and school holidays) yet. The Kid's Science Metal Detector, which can also be found at Kmart, for $20 .

"This dramatic video shows the moment that a car with a four-year-old passenger flipped and landed in a field after the driver led police on a three-minute chase. Driver Scott Tony Smith, who was banned from the roads, reached speeds of almost 100mph as he was pursued by police through County Durham after being caught driving too quickly. The car, an MG ZT, is seen weaving in and out of traffic on residential roads before speeding on to rural lanes - where it flips over a hedge and into a field after emerging from a T-junction at dangerous speed.

Smith, the boy and the boy's mother, who was also in the car, all escaped without major injuries, despite the child not being seated in a secure child seat, Durham Crown Court was told. Police chased Smith, 23, through the villages of The Middle and Craghead after asking him to pull over in South Stanley. Driver: Smith, who was driving the car, was banned from the road at the time of the dangerous chase. Above, the 23-year-old outside court today . At one stage, the camera, mounted on the police car, captures the video as it runs a red light and mounts a kerb to avoid oncoming traffic on a restricted road where roadworks were taking place. The pursuit reached its dramatic conclusion when the car shot out from a T-junction and flew over a hedge opposite. It is captured flipping in the air before landing in a farm field. The footage will be shown when Smith appears in court to be sentenced after pleading guilty to four charges relating to the incident, which took place on October 29. He admitted dangerous driving, driving while disqualified, failing to stop for police, and a child cruelty charge. Tony Davis, representing Smith, told the court that in the circumstances of the incident, by his admission to dangerous driving, the defendant has no defence to the child cruelty charge. 'The child in the car was not in a secure child seat. He has no legal defence to it, and that's why he's pleaded ""guilty"" to it.' Adjourning sentence to allow for preparation of a probation report, Judge Robert Adams told Smith: 'In ordering the pre-sentence report, I'm giving you no promises as to the sentence. 'All options will remain open to the court.' Smith, Stanley, County Durham, who remains disqualified from driving, was bailed to return for sentence in the week beginning January 19.

"When it comes to New Year resolutions, Mississippi dwellers may have a longer list than most. The state has been identified as most unhealthy in the country as the annual American Health Rankings reveal its citizens suffer from high levels of obesity, and diabetes, as well as low teen immunization coverage and low birth weight. For those in Hawaii, Vermont, and Massachusetts, however, you seem to be doing just fine. Which state is healthiest? The south and the Midwest remain low on the American Health Ranking list . Nationally, the 25th annual study recorded a significant increase in adult obesity rates this year from 27.6 per cent in 2013 to 29.4 per cent. The number of adults who exercise less than once a month also shot up from 22.9 per cent to 23.5 per cent. However, the number of smokers - which has been steadily diminishing - dropped by another three per cent in 2014, and infant mortality rates notched down four per cent. For the third year in a row Hawaii, which has never finished lower than sixth since the survey started in 1990, was awarded the top spot for its low rates of smoking, obesity, child poverty, preventable hospitalizations and deaths from cancer and cardiovascular disease. It was followed, in order, by Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Utah, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Colorado, North Dakota and Nebraska. National figures: Overall, an increasing number of Americans exercise less frequently than once a month . Rocketing: Obesity figures have continued to climb across the United States since the survey started in 1990 . Vermont has not moved from second place since 2011. After two years in fourth place, Massachusetts has celebrated a slight boost. Meanwhile, southern states continue to record poor health. Mississippi, which has never finished higher than 48th, remains in last place for the third year running. The state ranks well for low prevalence of binge drinking, high immunization coverage among children, and small disparity in health status. Good news! The number of smokers is continuing to diminish and this year saw another three per cent drop . But it ranks in the bottom 5 states on 16 of the 27 measures including low high school graduation rates and limited doctor or dentist availability. In 49th place came Arkansas followed by Louisiana at 48 then Kentucky, Oklahoma, Tennessee, West Virginia, Alabama, South Carolina and Indiana. 'We applaud hard-won advances in several key measures, including smoking prevalence, even as this year's America's Health Rankings is a solemn reminder that we have a lot more work ahead of us,' said Dr Reed Tuckson, senior medical adviser to the United Health Foundation, a nonprofit arm of insurer United Health Group.","American Health Ranking found Hawaii most and Mississippi least healthy .

"Baroness Hale, pictured, who says that seeing a woman's face when testifying in court is important and necessary . Women giving evidence in court should not be allowed to hide behind the veil, one of the country’s most senior judges said yesterday. Baroness Hale said judges should be able to insist that women reveal their faces to juries when necessary. She said she had come to the conclusion after ordering a mother in a family court case to remove her veil – when she realised the woman had been lying. Lady Hale said: ‘We should devise ways of making it possible and insisting people show their full face when it is necessary. There must come a point where we can insist.’ The deputy president of the Supreme Court has spoken out after a decade of controversy over whether Muslim witnesses and lawyers should be allowed to keep their faces covered in the courtroom. Despite a promise last year from the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, of a public consultation and clear new rules, the senior judiciary has been stalling, leaving judges and magistrates to decide for themselves what to do on a case-by-case basis. Taking up the issue, Lady Hale said: ‘We don’t object to allowing people to do things for sincerely held religious reasons if they don’t do any harm. If it does harm, we have to be a bit tougher.’ Recalling her own experience, she told how a mother in a family case arrived at court in ‘full purdah’. ‘In that particular case it really was very obvious both that she loved her children fantastically and that there were occasions when she was lying,’ Lady Hale said. ‘I don’t think it would have been as obvious if I had only been able to see her eyes. ‘There are other situations, not only giving evidence, when it is necessary to be able to recognise people and identify people. If it is necessary to see their face, then ways have got to be found to allow that to happen.’ Rebekah Dawson, left, who refused to remove her niqab full face veil, right, while standing trial at Blackfriars Crown Court last year . A number of senior figures, including former Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke, have made it clear that they believe judges should be able to insist that a witness remove a veil. The Lord Chief Justice has said that it is the responsibility of the senior judiciary to give guidance, and last year promised a public consultation ‘in the very near future’. Dawson's barrister Susan Meek had successfully argued at a pre-trial hearing that her client had a right to wear the niqab in court . Lord Thomas and fellow senior judges had been waiting for the European Court of Human Rights to give a view on French laws which ban the wearing of the burka or niqab in public places. The Strasbourg judges ruled in July that the French ban was justified in the cause of social cohesion. However, the consultation has not materialised. Lord Thomas said last month: ‘We have not got back to taking it into account, but I would hope to be able to do so as soon as is reasonably practicable.’ He explained that other, more pressing issues had come to the fore, adding: ‘There have been, one might say, some other problems but not that one.’ One case in which the veil was an issue was the trial in January of Muslim convert Rebekah Dawson at Blackfriars Crown Court in London. She refused to remove her niqab to give evidence in her trial for witness intimidation despite the demands of the judge. Eventually she chose not to go into the witness box, claiming it was against her religious beliefs to show her face to men. Later she was jailed for six months after changing her plea to guilty. Lady Hale also spoke out on the issue of divorce in an interview with the Evening Standard, joining a list of senior judges calling for measures to make the process easier for families. Previously she proposed no-fault divorce laws when she was head of the Law Commission in the 1990s. John Major’s government adopted her plans, but the scheme proved unworkable and the idea was dropped by Tony Blair. Reviving the issue, she said: ‘You would make a declaration that your marriage had irretrievably broken down and if you were still of that view a year later, then you get your divorce.’ The most senior family law judge, Sir James Munby, has called for couples to be allowed to register a divorce at a register office without the involvement of the courts.","Baroness Hale says seeing a woman's face in the courtroom is necessary .

Just last month, at least 120 people were killed when two suicide bombers blew themselves up at Kano's central mosque and gunmen opened fire on worshippers as they fled. Security analysts have seen the use of women - whether voluntarily and ideologically motivated or coerced - as a sign that Boko Haram wants to sow fear and terror further afield.

"New EU president Jean-Claude Juncker has warned David Cameron not to ‘beat up’ European immigrants to win votes. The European Commission chief said the free movement of workers ‘cannot be questioned’ and urged Mr Cameron not to introduce rules which ‘discriminate’ against foreigners. Mr Juncker’s controversial intervention comes after the Prime Minister outlined plans to ban immigrants claiming benefits or tax credits for four years. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker accused David Cameron or ‘beating up’ on European immigrants to win votes . The proposal will form the centrepiece of Mr Cameron’s renegotiation of Britain’s membership of the European Union. But in his first comments on the issue since Mr Cameron’s set-piece speech, Brussels most powerful bureaucrat warned against measures which would scapegoat poorer migrants working legally. He told the Guardian: ‘In Great Britain, which always fought for the enlargement of the European Union, there has to be an end to discrimination against countries just because it goes down well topically when you beat up others.' He added: ‘I am utterly against behaving as if all Poles, all Romanians, all Bulgarians in the European labour market are of a basic mentality that is criminal. These are people who are working and earning their wages.’ Mr Juncker said he was happy to discuss Mr Cameron’s proposals. He said: ‘We did not shoot down these ideas right away because I believe that we have to talk about them. ‘I am really interested in Great Britain remaining an active and constructive member of the EU.’ But he warned any undermining of the free movement would damage the common market – one of Margaret Thatcher’s lasting European achievements. David Cameron has outlined plans to ban new migrants claiming benefits in Britain for four years . He said: ‘This fundamental right of free movement of workers cannot be questioned existentially because if you question the free movement of workers Great Britain has to know that one day the free movement of capital will also be called into question. ‘Then it will be the end for London’s tax rulings, that will no longer be possible in London. ‘For me it is clear that free movement of labour was not enshrined in the treaties so that it could be abused. But it is the national legislatures who should fight against this abuse.’ Mr Juncker took over the European Commission last month in the face of fierce hostility from Downing Street.","European Commission says free movement 'cannot be questioned'

"Children in school cadet forces have been warned not to wear their army uniform in public amid fears of a terror attack. Pupils were also told to carry out searches of training areas and accommodation before setting up camp. A notice published on a Facebook group told individual units to ensure with ‘immediate effect’ that ‘appropriate security measures’ were put into place in all detachments. Scroll down for video . Children in school cadet forces have been warned not to wear their army uniform in public amid fears of a terror attack (file picture) The warnings come just days after serving soldiers were told not to wear their uniform outside barracks amid fears of a copycat attack following last year’s murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in south-east London. They were also told not to let strangers know that they are serving in the British Army. Earlier this week, police were also warned not to wear their uniforms off-duty following an ‘anonymous but credible’ telephone threat. A Combined Cadet Force source told the Mail: ‘It is such a terrible shame that children are being told not to wear their uniforms. It is sad they can’t proudly walk the streets.’ The threat level for the armed forces was raised from ‘substantial’ to ‘severe’ last week, meaning a terrorist attack on military personnel is highly likely. This week, soldiers were warned not to wear their uniforms outside barracks amid fears of a copycat attack following Lee Rigby's murder (pictured) An MoD spokesman said the same security measures that applied to serving personnel also applied to cadet forces across the country. In light of the revised terror threat level, a spokesman for the Middlesex and North West London Army Cadet Force issued a six-point list for managing security for children across the region. The directives issued to more than 1,000 cadets included: ‘No uniform when travelling to and from cadet activities.’ Another rule told members to maintain ‘vigilance when travelling including at motorway service stations… hence civilian clothes when travelling’. Others warned them to ‘ensure vehicles are guarded or parked in a secure area’ and ‘carry out searches of training areas, ranges and accommodation before occupation’. They were also told to ensure all accommodation was secure when not in use and to report any suspicious activity. Military officials took to Twitter to warn cadets not to wear their uniform. A spokesman for the 235 Westminster Cadet Detachment wrote: ‘Reminder not to travel into the unit in uniform. Bring it in a bag and change in the unit.’ Whitehall officials are understood to have noticed increased ‘chatter’ among jihadists wanting to carry out a beheading or other high-profile attack on a serving soldier. Fanatics have been searching online for the location of army barracks across the country to identify targets. Commanders have told soldiers to act as if the threat is ‘critical’ – the highest level of terrorism alert – and to be ready for an imminent attack. Last month, 15-year-old army cadet Callum Watkins was attacked with a makeshift flame-thrower as he sold poppies wearing his uniform. The teenager suffered minor burns in the assault in Manchester city centre ahead of Remembrance Sunday.","Facebook post told units to put 'appropriate security measures' in place .

"A Hawaiian fisherman who was given up for dead has said that the 12 days he spent eating raw fish and being battered by 20 foot waves were worth it, because it led to him being reunited with his long lost son. After an extensive four day search for Ron Ingraham, 67, Coastguard officials called off the hunt and notified his estranged 43-year-old son Zakary, that his father was unlikely to be found alive. But the resourceful fisherman defied the odds to be rescued after 12 days at sea and now the pair are planning an emotional reunion after more than 15 years apart. Scroll down for video . Ron Ingraham was given up for dead by coastguard officials but the 67-year-old managed to survive for 12 days at sea after his boat lost power in a storm near his home on Hawaii's Molokai island. After he was rescued he said the ordeal was worthwhile because it had reunited him with his long lost son . Ingraham, pictured in the beige shirt, managed to survive by catching and eating raw tuna and mahi mahi. He put out a mayday alert after his 25-foot vessel was pummeled by a storm and lost power . After four fruitless days, the Hawaiian coastguard called off the search and notified Ron Ingraham's son Zakary that his father was likely lost to the sea. Zakary who lives hundreds of miles away in Missouri had not spoken to his father since the mid 1990s . 'I got a hold of my son, so that's really huge,' Ron tearfully told reporters. 'That's a beautiful, beautiful part to this whole thing. It's all I can do to stop from crying, thinking about the whole thing.' Sailing from his home on the island of Molokai to the Lanai, where he often goes fishing, Ingraham was pummeled by a huge storm which knocked out the engine on his boat. After receiving his November 27 mayday saying he was in danger of sinking, the Hawaiian Coast Guard began hunting for his 25-foot vessel. Finding no sign of the craft they told Zakary, who lived hundreds of miles away in St Joseph, Missouri, that his father was likely lost to the sea. The news hit him hard as the pair had lost contact around 15 years earlier, but he didn't want to believe his father was gone. Meanwhile, his fisherman father was fighting to stay alive, by eating raw tuna and mahi mahi fish he caught in the ocean. In a last gasp attempt to get rescued Ingraham put a wire coat hanger into his radio. His antennae had been damaged by the storm. Amazingly he managed to get a signal, which led to him being rescued by a US Navy destroyer . After he was rescued, Ingraham spoke to his son for the first time in more than 15-years. The pair are now planning a reunion . He too, was thinking about the broken relationship with his son, who had moved away from Molokai with his mother, aged seven. Both had since tried and failed to make contact. 'I lived off the moisture off the fish I caught,' Ingraham said. 'Mentally, physically and spiritually, I got my butt kicked.' Eventually he got weak and assumed he would die. 'I thought this was it,' he said, adding that friends had planned his funeral. But in a last gasp attempt to make contact, a weakened Ingraham stuck a wire coat hanger into his radio, which had lost its antenna to the storm. Amazingly he managed to get off a garbled transmission that led to him being found a US Navy guided-missile destroyer, the USS Paul Hamilton. 'I look out the door, and there's a battleship doing 38 knots coming right at me,' he recalled. After bringing him aboard crew members wanted to let his battered boat go, but Ingraham who lives on the vessel begged them not to. Eventually they coordinated with the Coast Guard to have the boat towed to Molokai. 'I want to put out a special thanks to that captain and that crew,' Ron Ingraham said. 'These guys were so professional. They saved my life.' After arriving on dry land he spoke to his son for the first time since the mid 1990s. He did not say when they plan to meet.","Ron Ingraham's 25-foot boat lost power after it was pummeled by a storm .

"One of Ukip's biggest donors has threatened to stop funding the party unless the disgraced former Tory Neil Hamilton is given a parliamentary seat, it was claimed last night. Stuart Wheeler's alleged intervention has sparked a furious reaction – with his replacement as party Treasurer Andrew Reid insisting that 'nobody gets to buy a seat' for their friends. The row blew up on Wednesday night after a letter to Mr Hamilton asking him to explain his expenses was leaked  – forcing him to pull out of a contest to become the party's candidate in a winnable seat in next year's election. Ukip's deputy chairman Neil Hamilton lashed out at party insiders over a 'dirty tricks' campaign being run against him . Mr Hamilton only saw the letter as he arrived at a hustings event in the Essex constituency of Basildon South – one of Ukip's top targets for 2015. He then withdrew his candidacy – and slammed the letter as part of a wider 'dirty tricks' campaign against him. But many others in Ukip believe Mr Hamilton is getting unfair leg up due to his close relationship with the millionaire party donor Mr Wheeler. One member of the party leadership told the Financial Times: 'I don't care how powerful his patron is, we are not caving [in] to this.' Andrew Reid, who took over from Mr Wheeler as the party's treasurer six months ago, added: 'Nobody gets to buy a seat for someone else in Ukip.' Mr Hamilton, a former Tory minister, lost his seat in the 1997 Labour landslide to the anti-sleaze campaigner Martin Bell, who stood as an independent. It came after he was forced to resign as a Tory minister after allegations that he received cash for asking questions in the Commons. He denied the claims, but a parliamentary inquiry found that he took cash for questions. Nigel Farage appearing BBC Question Time with the Hollywood star Russell Brand is facing growing civil war . The dispute could prove expensive for the party as it approaches its most important general election, at which it hopes to break through as a serious challenger to the big established parties. Mr Wheeler has made more than £700,000 worth of registered donations to Ukip over the past five years, and was expected to remain an important donor over the coming months. Mr Hamilton would not comment on the events. Mr Wheeler would not say whether he intended to donate more money before the election, or whether he had threatened not to if Mr Hamilton was not accepted as a parliamentary candidate. He told the FT: 'I cannot tell you what internal conversations have gone on.'","Stuart Wheeler threatens to stop donations if Hamilton not given seat .

"Deputy Children's Commissioner Sue Berelowitz (pictured) said children will kill themselves if they believe their names will become known to the public . Children will be pushed into committing suicide if the secretive family courts are opened to public scrutiny, a senior government official has sensationally claimed. Deputy Children's Commissioner Sue Berelowitz said children will kill themselves if they believe their names and their troubled lives will become known to the public. In a controversial speech calling for the courts to stay closed, she said: 'I have worked closely with profoundly distressed and damaged and troubled children all my working life. I know and understand their minds; it is my job. I know how little it takes to tip a child over the edge.' The remarks were greeted with astonishment and disbelief by campaigners for open justice. One said: 'I don't know what planet this woman is on.' High Court judge Sir Roderick Newton, who spoke alongside Miss Berelowitz in a legal debate on whether the courts and their decisions should be reported in the media, said family courts should be open to scrutiny. He said: 'To put it rather bluntly, if a judge can change the whole of someone's life by the stroke of a pen, then there is a pressing need, an overwhelming need, I would say, for openness.' During her address, Miss Berelowitz broke a widely observed media rule and described a common means of suicide. She added: 'I genuinely fear that it is only a matter of time before this deeply misguided motion, which has at its heart, I believe, an utter disregard for the welfare and best interests of children, and is, in my view, therefore unlawful, will result in the death of a child.' It is not the first time Miss Berelowitz has made controversial comments. During her career in child protection: . - She was a director of children's services for a local council rated 'inadequate' by inspectors; . - She produced a report on gang sex abuse of children which said there was no evidence to suggest that the majority of the perpetrators of abuse were groups of Asian men. - One of her first public statements as Deputy Children's Commissioner was to respond to the outcry over the death of Baby P. She said 'the safeguarding of children requires the implementation of basic good practice'. Miss Berelowitz also warned that the Children's Commissioner would protest to the UN children's rights committee over the issue of openness in family courts. Her intervention comes amid an ongoing dispute among judges, lawyers and social workers over how far the family courts should be opened. Birmingham Yardley MP John Hemming said: 'I don't know what planet this woman is on. If the media had not looked at the abuse of children in care, the events in Rotherham would never have been known' A major push for openness has been launched by the chief family law judge, President of the Family Division Sir James Munby, who chaired last month's debate in London, at which Miss Berelowitz set down the first publicly acknowledged official opposition to allowing scrutiny of the family courts. The speeches were published yesterday. Sir Roderick was at the centre of a scandal last year when courts secretly ordered that Italian woman Alessandra Pacchieri should undergo a forced caesarean after suffering a breakdown at Stansted Airport, and that her child should be adopted. Sir Roderick was the judge who ordered the adoption. He said: 'In the Italian case . . . the reporting initially was pretty inaccurate. That wasn't necessarily the fault of the Press who had little or nothing to go on when the story was first sent to them. When I released my judgment on December 2, it led to a much better discussion. 'What the Italian case did was well and truly launch a comprehensive national discussion about how these sensitive issues can and should be addressed. 'If a system is constantly accused of being secret, biased and unaccountable, the children in whose name we try to make the best decisions are the ones that ultimately will feel undermined.' Miss Berelowitz's suicide warning was greeted with amazement among campaigners for open justice and media figures. Lib Dem MP John Hemming said: 'I don't know what planet this woman is on. If the media had not looked at the abuse of children in care, the events in Rotherham would never have been known.' Bob Satchwell of the Society of Editors said: 'No-one in the media wants to expose details about children unless there are exceptional reasons to do so. It is strange that Miss Berelowitz uses emotional language when media organisations would be extremely careful in discussing matters like that to prevent copycat actions.' Campaigners for greater openness are not calling for children to be identified in family proceedings. In cases in which proceedings can be reported, identifying children would be contempt of court, for which reporters or editors could go to jail.","Deputy Children's Commissioner Sue Berelowitz said children will kill themselves if they believe their names will become known to the public .

"A folk artist who became a folk hero to some after picking a fight with fast-food giant Chik-fil-A over use of the phrase 'eat more kale' — similar to their trademarked 'eat mor chikin' — has won his legal battle. Bo Muller-Moore said on Thursday that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted his application to trademark 'eat more kale,' a phrase he says promotes local agriculture. He silk-screens the phrase on T-shirts and sweatshirts and prints them on bumper stickers that are common in Vermont and beyond. When asked what he felt caused the trademark office to approve his application, Muller-Moore, of Montpelier, said, 'Your guess is as good as mine.' The news was posted on the office's website on Tuesday. Victor: Bo Muller-Moore, who built his  business around the phrase 'eat more kale,'  was engaged in a trademark fight with fast-food giant Chick-fil-A and he won his battle . 'I'd like to think that maybe some persistence and polite defiance, you know, and proving to them that we were in it for the long haul,' he said. 'If it took us a decade, we're going to fight for a decade.' Muller-Moore is planning a formal announcement of his victory Friday with Gov. Peter Shumlin and other supporters on the Statehouse steps. 'The message is out: Don't mess with Vermont. And don't mess with Bo,' Shumlin said on Thursday in a statement. 'This isn't just a win for the little guy who stands up to a corporate bully; it's a win for our state. In Vermont, we care about what's in our food, who grows it, and where it comes from.' 'Cows love kale, too,' said Carrie Kurlander, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta-based Chik-fil-A. Muller-Moore started using the phrase in 2000 after a farmer friend who grows the leafy vegetable that is known for its nutritional value asked him to make three T-shirts for his family for $10 each. The phrase caught on and, with the approval of the farmer, Muller-Moore began putting it on clothing and bumper stickers. In the summer of 2011, Muller-Moore sought to trademark the phrase. It was a short time later that Chik-fil-A sent Muller-Moore a letter telling him to stop using the phrase because the company felt it could be confused with ""eat mor chikin."" In the letter, Chik-fil-A cited 30 examples of others who had tried to use the ""eat more"" phrase and withdrew it after the company objected. But Muller-Moore refused. 'In our case, we said we're not going to cease and desist until a federal judge tells us to and as far as the trademark goes, I never wavered from the idea that I deserved protection from copycat artists,', Muller-Moore said. His public fight drew the support of Shumlin and a team of pro-bono lawyers, including law students from the University of New Hampshire legal clinic.

"A Utah grandmother who was left fighting for her life after unwittingly drinking poisoned iced tea at a barbecue chain has reached a settlement with the firm, it was today revealed. Jan Harding, 67, was rushed to hospital in a critical condition after swallowing the mixture of iced tea and lye, an industrial cleaning solution, at Dickey's Barbecue Pit in South Jordan, Salt Lake City. She was forced to undergo two weeks of treatment for severe internal damage, including deep, ulcerated burns in her upper esophagus and mouth, before being released on August 20. Now, the married mother-of-three has agreed on a deal with Dickey's that will apparently lead to extensive changes at the business to ensure such an incident never happens again. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEo . Deadly: Jan Harding, 67, was left fighting for her life after drinking poisoned iced tea at Dickey's Barbecue Pit in South Jordan, Utah. Above, the grandmother sweetens her drink (left) before taking her first sip (right . Reaction: Instantly, Mrs Harding realizes something is wrong and hunches over a trash can, vomiting up the drink (left). Her husband then arrives by her side (right) and she is rushed to the University of Utah Hospital . In a joint statement, Mrs Harding and the chain said they had come to an out-of-court settlement, but refused to disclose how much money the victim had received, nor any details of the deal. 'Everyone involved is grateful that Ms. Harding has made a good recovery,' the statement said. In October, new footage was revealed showing a worker at the chain accidentally mixing lye - instead of sugar - into an iced tea dispenser just minutes before the near-fatal incident. Lye, an odorless chemical that looks like sugar, is used for degreasing deep fryers and is the active ingredient in Drano. When swallowed, it can tighten and burn the esophagus and lead to death. Couple: Mrs Harding (seen with her husband) was forced to undergo two weeks of treatment for severe internal damage, including deep, ulcerated burns in her upper esophagus and mouth, before her release . Desperate: Now, the married mother-of-three (pictured trying to flush the toxic chemical out of her mouth with a glass of water) has reached a settlement with Dickey's. She has received an undisclosed sum of money . Mrs Harding, who was donning a bright green top and a black skirt, was then caught on surveillance camera sweetening her iced tea at the dispenser, before taking a single sip. Instantly, she realized something was wrong and hunched over a trash can, vomiting up the drink. A fellow customer a store manager stopped to check on her, but she continued to throw up. After her husband arrived by her side and spoke to members of staff, Mrs Harding was rushed to the University of Utah Hospital, where doctors carried out an endoscopy. This involved inserting a tube with a light and camera into the grandmother's digestive tract, to assess the damage - and it was worst than medics initially thought. Hazardous: In October, this new footage was revealed showing a worker at the chain accidentally mixing lye - instead of sugar - into an iced tea dispenser (pictured)  just minutes before the near-fatal incident . Scene: In September, prosecutors chose not to file charges in the incident at the Dickey's branch in South Jordan (pictured) saying there were errors and mishaps, but no evidence of any criminal wrongdoing. She was forced to undergo extensive treatment for the burns in both her upper esophagus and mouth and could not speak for the majority of her time in hospital, her family lawyer Paxton Guymon said. Because Mrs Harding was the first one to drink from the batch of tea, no one else was harmed. In September, prosecutors chose not to file charges in the incident, saying there were errors and mishaps, but no evidence of any criminal wrongdoing. Although Mrs Harding and her family apparently accepted the decision by Salt Lake County Attorney Sim Gill, they were determined to work with Dickey's to implement new, safer procedures. Determined: Although Mrs Harding (pictured with her daughter) and her family apparently accepted the decision by attorney Sim Gill, they were determined to work with Dickey's to implement safer procedures .

"A 35-year-old teacher has been arrested after allegedly leaving her three young children home alone so she could go partying with her husband and get a tattoo. Laura Aguero, who earns $79,000-a-year at Middle School 88 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, reportedly abandoned her sons, aged four, five and 12, at her duplex in Sunset Park on Wednesday night. She then went to a tattoo parlor in Lower East Side to get an inking finished, before going out drinking in a nearby bar, police said. During this time, she got into a fight with her husband, Alfredo Bobe. While the couple were out, their neighbors reportedly heard a loud crash coming from inside their home on 52nd Street near Third Avenue at around 3.15am, and called 911. Scroll down for video . Science teacher: Laura Aguero (pictured), from Sunset Park, Brooklyn, has been arrested after allegedly leaving her three young children home alone so she could go partying with her husband and get a tattoo . When police arrived at the property, they allegedly found the boys home alone. Forty minutes later, Aguero and Bobe stumbled up to the house and started to drunkenly fight outside the door, it is said. At some point during their fight, Bobe, 41, reportedly smashed a front-door glass window in a bid to get into the property, according to the New York Post. However, he and Aguero were quickly arrested. Now, Aguero, an avid bicyclist who has been a City Middle School science teacher for more than a decade, has been charged with three counts of endangering the welfare of a child. She has also reportedly been 'reassigned away from any classroom' and banned from contact with students at Middle School 88. Bobe, meanwhile, has been charged with criminal mischief.

Bar: She later apparently attended Local 138 bar’s (pictured) 'Whiskey Wednesday' event with her husband . During the couple's night out, Aguero is believed to have got her tattoo finished at Inborn Tattoo in Lower East Side, before attending Local 138 bar’s 'Whiskey Wednesday' event. Shockingly, in a subsequent police interview, she even reportedly admitted to officers that her night out without her children had involved being inked, according to CBS2. In her Facebook photos, the suspect has an intricate sleeve tattoo running down her left arm, as well as further inkings around her ankles. During a police investigation, officers found 'clothes and garbage strewn around' the couple's filthy apartment, prosecutors said. School: Aguero, an avid bicyclist, has been charged with three counts of endangering the welfare of a child.She has also reportedly been 'reassigned away from any classroom' at Middle School 88 (pictured) It is reportedly not the first time Aguero has been in trouble with the law.

"A Tennessee woman charged with attempted murder spent three years trying to poison her husband before shooting him, court documents have revealed. Mother-of-two Misty Lee Addair, 32, left her husband Stephen for dead when she shot him in the back outside a rural house in Bluff City, Sullivan County, in June. The 44-year-old was taken to Johnson City Medical Center in a critical condition but survived. Revelations: Mother-of-two Misty Lee Addair, 32, from Bluff City, Tennessee, tried to poison her husband for three years before shooting him in the back, court documents have revealed . He was found lying in the woods by his parents who heard a scream. His wife was then discovered by police in woods nearby with their two children. She was initially charged with one count of attempted first degree murder, but another was added following an investigation that revealed she had been trying to poison him. According to the Bristol Herald Courier, the revelations were unveiled due to work of the Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Veteran’s Administration. However Sullivan County District Attorney General Barry Staubus would not reveal the details of the poisoning. Addair was initially released on bond after she was arrested, on the condition she did not contact her husband. Now her bail has been substantially increased to $50,000. A judge has placed her in a correctional facility. In June, Sheriff Wayne Anderson said the couple and their children moved out of their Piney Flats home and had been living in Stephen Addair’s parents’ house. Anderson said that the shooting was premeditated based on several factors, including Addair’s suggestion that her husband take a walk in the woods to check on a trail camera placed there. Aftermath: Stephen's parents found him lying in the woods with a gunshot wound after hearing a scream and took him to the Johnson City Medical Center (pictured0 .","Misty Lee Addair, 32, left her husband Stephen, 44, for dead in June .

"Five men who smashed an American student's eye socket with a bottle he was drinking from 'because he was obviously not local' are facing jail today. Francesco Hounye, 23, had been in Britain just three days when he was attacked by the gang who kicked him in the head as he lay wounded on the ground, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. He was set upon in an area where a 'Muslim patrol' attempting to enforce Sharia law in east London had previously been caught on camera. But police have stressed that there was no evidence to suggest this attack was a hate crime or motivated by religion in any way. Scroll down for video . Francesco Hounye, 23, had been in the UK for just three days when he was set upon by a gang, who smashed a bottle in his face . Detailed CCTV footage captured the attack on the American student by  a group of Asian men . Samad Uddin, 24, Shaleem Uddin, 21, Shadhat Hussain, 20, Kamrul Hussain, 23, and Massom Rahman, 22, targeted the student when they saw him swigging from a bottle of Jagermeister. Mr Hounye had been out for the night in the Brick Lane area of east London and was walking with a friend to his home in Shadwell in June last year. He was confronted by the group who wrestled the bottle from him, then chased him and smashed the bottle over his head – leaving him needing 23 stitches in his face. CCTV footage footage shows Mr Hounye being kicked mercilessly as he lay crouched in the road. Masoon Rahman, pictured at Snaresbrook Crown Court, where he has admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent . Mr Hounye had been out for the night in the Brick Lane area of east London with a friend he had been staying with when he was attacked . Police have stressed that there was no evidence to suggest this attack was a hate crime or motivated by religion in any way . Six months after the attack a demonstration was staged in nearby Brick Lane where around 60 protestors targeted Muslim-owned businesses for selling ‘evil’ alcohol. Samad Uddin was on trial for inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent after the four others admitted their roles in the attack. But he later changed his plea and admitted the charge. Shaleem Uddin and Kamrul Hussain both hold previous convictions for assaults in 2010 but they escaped with suspended sentences. The gang were identified after CCTV surveillance captured the apparently spontaneous group attack . Shadhat Hussain has been before the courts for possession of cannabis and cocaine while Rahman was of previous good character. The gang were identified after CCTV surveillance captured the apparently spontaneous group attack. ‘All of them were willingly involved in that attack, all of them played a part,’ said prosecutor Paul Casey. ‘Two in particular played the most serious role, Shaleem Uddin and Samad Uddin. ‘Shaleem Uddin used the bottle to strike Mr Hounye over the head, causing him severe cuts to the side of his head. The student said as a result of the attack he was now too scared to go out on his own in London . ‘Immediately prior to that, Samad Uddin and a number of others were involved trying to wrestle the bottle from Mr Hounye.’ ‘During the course of the attack Samad Uddin aimed a number of kicks to Mr Hounye whilst he was prone on the ground, including one which CCTV shows his right foot connecting with some force with Mr Hounye’s head.’ In the CCTV footage Samad Uddin can be seen taking hold of Mr Hounye’s shoulder. The victim was then grabbed from behind by a second male and other members of the gang wrestled the bottle from his clutches. ‘The first punches are thrown at Mr Hounye, the bottle is wrestled from him, Shelim Hussain smashes him over the head with the bottle,’ said Mr Casey. Samad Uddin is seen kicking Mr Hounye across the road after he broke free and attempted to escape. Mr Hounye was grabbed from behind by one male and other members of the gang wrestled the bottle from his clutches . Samad Uddin is seen kicking Mr Hounye across the road after he broke free and attempted to escape . He was arrested in April this year after he was recognised by a police officer who had seen the CCTV footage, but initially claimed the allegations were as a result of mistaken identity. Samad Uddin from Shadwell and Shaleem Uddin from Whitechapel have admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Kamrul Hussain from Whitechapel, Shadhat Hussain from Canning Town and Masoom Rahman from Whitechapel also admitted the charge. The Metropolitan Police told MailOnline: 'There is no evidence to suggest that this attack was a hate crime or motivated by religion in any way. Speculation to the contrary is wrong and potentially damaging to community relations.' They said Mr Hounye was assaulted simply because he was 'obviously not local.' In a statement, traumatised Mr Hounye, who had come to London to study, said: 'As a result of this incident I am now scared to go out on my own in London. 'I am a visitor to the UK and was considering continuing my studies here but this incident has made me think twice. 'I feel very emotional about the whole situation. I also now face the rest of my life with the permanent scarring that will be left on my face as a result of this attack. 'Every time I look in the mirror from now on I will be reminded of this incident.' The gang are due to be sentenced later today.","Student Francesco Hounye, 23, was attacked by a gang in east London .

"Doctors in France will be allowed to keep terminally ill patients sedated until death comes under new plans (file picture) Terminally ill patients could be sedated until they die under plans in France to end suffering in the last stages of their life. The laws would give people the 'right to deep, continuous sedation until death' at patients' request - and only when their condition is life-threatening in the short term. The French parliament will debate a draft law on the highly sensitive issue from January, President Francois Hollande has revealed. Although euthanasia is not permitted in France, laws were passed in 2005 that allows for 'passive euthanasia', where a person causes death by withdrawing or withholding treatment. Outlining how the new laws would go a step further, Hollande said current legislation was too focused on the doctor's analysis and did not consider the patient's wishes. But he stopped short of recommending lethal injections and avoided the terms euthanasia and assisted suicide. 'These proposals are centred on the patients whose suffering should be avoided. It respects their choice and wishes,' Hollande said. Apart from Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, few countries in the world explicitly permit euthanasia or assisted suicide. The issue is contentious in France where debate has raged over whether terminally ill patients suffering in the last stages of their life should be allowed to die. Hollande promised before his 2012 election to introduce new . right-to-die legislation in France, which left grey areas in a . 2005 law on patient rights and care for the terminally ill. The  Leonetti law currently limits 'therapeutic . obstinacy', or treatments that only prolong the life of a . terminally ill patient without providing a cure. Hollande said the new proposals would mean that if a patient's life was immediately in danger and the treatment was not working or causing more suffering then they could be sedated. If a patient was unable to decide alone, then the doctor - with consultation - would have an obligation to end . treatment because it would only be keeping the patient . artificially alive, Hollande said. He added that if a person had indicated either before . falling seriously ill or during their sickness how they wished . to die then doctors should take account of those instructions. French President Francois Hollande (pictured) delivers his speech about reform of end-of-life treatment at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France . 'Advance directives in which everyone can stipulate refusal . of aggressive treatment for serious illness would be ""binding"" under these proposals,' Hollande said. Opinion polls show broad support for legalised euthanasia in . late terminal cases. Hospital staff convicted of helping . patients die in recent years have often been given suspended . sentences in view of this approach. The issue gained prominence after an elderly couple took their own lives in a luxury Paris hotel in 2013 leaving a note . explaining that they had wanted to die with dignity. 'These proposals are balanced and realistic. They aim to . stop the suffering of those close to the end of their lives, . respect their wishes and allows the right to die in dignity,' Hollande said.","Doctors will be allowed to keep terminally ill patients sedated until death under new plans .

"Shocking allegations: Starla Rae McCabe, 45, from Perry, Utah, has been charged with 10 counts of sexual exploitation of a minor for allegedly selling naked pictures of her 5-year-old daughter . A Utah mother has been arrested for allegedly taking pictures of her half-naked 5-year-old daughter and selling them to men. Starla Rae McCabe, 45, from Perry, Utah, has been charged with 10 counts of sexual exploitation of a minor. According to a probable cause statement obtained by Deseret News, police armed with a warrant searched a Nintendo DSi video game device featuring a camera and discovered a cache of 19 photo s depicting McCabe's 5-year-old daughter. The child appeared naked from the waist down, with her genitals fully exposed, and some of the pictures also showed her face. When interviewed by police last month, the toddler said that her mother would print out her X-rated pictures and sell them for $100 apiece. During questioning, the 45-year-old woman admitted to taking the pornographic photos, but said she did it for educational purposes: to show her young daughter what her vagina looked like. Officials were tipped off about McCabe's alleged side business last March when a relative discovered the nude photos on the handled Nintendo game. McCabe, a Maine native living in Perry, has three biological children from past relationships - two sons and a daughter -  and two stepdaughters. According to her Facebook profile, she works three jobs: as a sales person at a thrift shop, as a motel housekeeper and as a cashier at a dollar store. Victim speaks: The girl, pictured here as a toddler with her face obscured, told police her mother printed photos showing her without her clothes on and sold them to people for $100 apiece . Matriarch: McCabe (third left) has three biological children and two stepdaughters (believed to be pictured here with their faces obscured) Her relationship status indicates that McCabe is engaged. According to court records, the mother of three has a long history of run-ins with the law involving child endangerment, drug offenses and repeated probation violations. In April of this year, she pleaded guilty to drug possession and attempted child endangerment. The woman was placed on 36 months of probation requiring her to undergo treatment for drug addiction. But when sheriff's officials arrived at her home with a search warrant, they discovered methamphetamine in the bathroom and inside a drawer in the living room within easy reach of a child. Lawbreaker: The 45-year-old mother of three has a long history of run-ins with the law involving child endangerment, child abuse, meth-related offences and repeated probation violations . McCabe was found to be in violation of the conditions of her probation and sent to jail to await a court hearing. In 2010, she pleaded guilty to attempted child endangerment and possession of drug paraphernalia but broke her probation. A similar scenario played out four years earlier when she was found guilty of child abuse and sentenced to 36 months of probation, which she violated six months later. Miss McCabe is due back in court for a preliminary hearing December 15.","Starla Rae McCabe, 45, from, Utah, has been charged with 10 counts of sexual exploitation of a minor .

"Russell Brand’s appearance on Question Time sparked a furious backlash against the BBC yesterday, with MPs calling the programme a ‘farce’ Russell Brand’s appearance on Question Time sparked a furious backlash against the BBC yesterday, with MPs calling the programme a ‘farce’ and viewers comparing it to The Jeremy Kyle Show. The multi-millionaire comedian clashed with Ukip leader Nigel Farage on Thursday night’s tawdry edition of the corporation’s long-running current affairs show. But unimpressed viewers complained that guests were simply shouting at each other and likened the broadcast to an episode of The Jeremy Kyle Show, which gets together troubled families in front of a studio audience for heated rows about topics such as infidelity and parenting. On Twitter, viewer Alice Hassall, wrote: ‘Wow this is like posh Jeremy Kyle.’ Dr Sarah Quinnell posted: ‘Is this Question Time or is it in fact Jeremy Kyle? Will Dimblebot announce that Farage is Brand’s father?’ Labour MP Ian Austin said the once-great BBC show had become a ‘farce’, writing on Twitter: ‘The idea we have to pay the licence fee for this total and utter garbage. What a farce. What a terrible programme. Just terrible.’ As the row deepened last night, it also emerged that a man with a walking stick who mocked Mr Brand from the audience is related to a Ukip MEP. Robert Carver, brother of Ukip West Midlands MEP James Carver, challenged Mr Brand to stand for Parliament. When Mr Brand replied: ‘I’m scared I’d become one of them’, Mr Carver, from Chislehurst, responded: ‘You can’t preach that, that’s rubbish!’ A blog post appeared on a website last month written by Rob Carver, identifying himself as the MEP’s brother and stating: ‘Rob has been asked by Ukip to stand as the party candidate in the Tory safe seat of Beckenham at the general election.’ Unimpressed viewers complained that guests were simply shouting at each other and likened the broadcast to an episode of The Jeremy Kyle Show, which gets together troubled families in front of a studio audience for heated rows about topics such as infidelity and parenting . Russell Brand’s appearance on Question Time sparked a furious backlash against the BBC yesterday, with MPs calling the programme a ‘farce’ and viewers comparing it to The Jeremy Kyle Show . Yesterday, a war of words also broke out between Mr Brand and Mr Farage. Mr Farage claimed the comedian had his chest hair ‘straightened’ before going on air . Another audience member, who repeatedly shouted that Mr Farage was racist and at one point screamed ‘I’m coming to get you’, was widely named as Socialist Workers’ Party activist Bunny La Roche, a member of Thanet Stand Up to Ukip, which is campaigning to stop Mr Farage becoming MP for Thanet South in Kent. Yesterday, a war of words also broke out between Mr Brand and Mr Farage. Mr Farage claimed the comedian had his chest hair ‘straightened’ before going on air, saying: ‘Everyone fancied that Mr Brand and I might butt heads. But as we entered the studio, and his personal make-up artist straightened his chest hair for him – I kid you not – I realised that perhaps he might be a bit lighter weight than expected.’ The comedian hit back by suggesting Mr Farage had been drinking before his appearance. On his blog, he wrote: ‘Nigel Farage in the flesh, gin blossomed flesh that it is, inspires sympathy more than fear.’ A spokesman for Mr Farage rejected the suggestion that he had too much to drink – although accepted Mr Farage may have had a ‘small G&T’.","Russell Brand clashed with UKIP leader Nigel Farage on the BBC show .

"The top ten most expensive house sales of the year have been revealed - topped by a stunning £50million penthouse. Land Registry data confirmed that an apartment on Princes Gate, London, was the biggest deal of the year and cost almost twice as much as the second most expensive property, a £27million terraced home in west London. The £50million apartment is one of 11,115 properties which have sold for more than £1million in 2014. The deal went through in July with the buyer left with a huge £3.5million stamp duty bill. One flat at Princes Gate (pictured) near Hyde Park in central London, sold for £50million in 2014 while a second Princes Gate apartment set another buyer back £26.5million, Land Registry data has revealed .

A seven-bedroom mansion on Holland Villas Road, Kensington, London, which exchanged hands for £24million, was the joint fifth most expensive property . However, if the house - which cost 282 times as much as the average home - was bought now the tax bill would shoot up to just under £6million following the stamp duty change. The penthouse, which was not marketed publicly, is the second most expensive property in Land Registry history after a mansion in The Boltons, west London, which sold for £55million in 2012.

"A health and safety inspector suffered life-changing burns in an NHS hospital while undergoing routine surgery after staff made a mistake using an electric blanket known as a 'hot dog'. Mike Wilcock, 58, required a skin graft after suffering third-degree burns to his right buttock after undergoing surgery to remove a cyst on his kidney at Maidstone Hospital in Kent. Inner London Crown Court heard that staff had not been properly trained in how to use the electric blanket. Mike Wilcock suffered third degree burns to his buttock during the botched surgery in Maidstone hospital . Mr Wilcock underwent the routine surgery on a kidney cyst at Maidstone Hospital, pictured, in 2012 . Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust is facing a possible six-figure fine after admitting failing in its duty under the 1974 Health and Safety Act. Prosecutor William Davis told the court that Mr Wilcock gone through a 'stressful and painful experience' since the procedure in September 25, 2012. The temperature of the warming equipment, which can rise to 50C in less than an hour, had soared during Mr Wilcock's operation because a cold saline bag was touching a sensor, the court heard. The injuries - caused during the routine operation - meant he was admitted to a specialist burns unit at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead during September of 2012. The burn caused permanent scarring and left Mr Wilcock out of work for four months. He must now be chauffeured by his wife Eileen due to mobility problems, Inner London Crown Court heard. 'It caused the mattress to become extremely hot,' Mr Davis said. Malcolm Fortune, defending the NHS Trust at Inner London Crown Court, pictured, asked Mr Justice Sweeney to consider a fine in the region of £200,000 to £300,000 as the affair has already cost them almost £100,000 . No alarm was raised during the operation and his injuries were only discovered when Mr Wilcock woke up to discover a large burn on his right hip and buttock, the court heard. He was referred to a burns unit and has needed repeated hospital treatment on his burns, and has also developed cardiac problems, the hearing was told. 'Mr Wilcock has suffered serious and ongoing effects as a result of his injury,' Mr Davis said. The court heard the hospital trust had committed eight breaches of duty over 17 months after first acquiring the equipment in April 2011. They included failing to provide adequate training to staff on how to use the equipment and not properly investigating two previous incidents, including one patient who received minor burns caused by the machine. Mr Wilcock, who works for the Health and Safety Executive, is now pursuing a civil claim. The trust's medical director Dr Paul Sigston offered a direct apology to Mr Wilcock and his wife Eileen when he appeared in the witness box during today's hearing. He said: 'I'd like to express to Mr and Mrs Wilcock that I'm deeply sorry this event occurred. 'I'm aware of the harm and stress impacted on their lives.' Mr Wilcock, left,  who is a health and safety inspector, said the September 2012 incident changed his 'perception of life' and has left him with permanent scarring to his buttock and hip area, right . After the hearing, Mr Wilcock, from Tunbridge Wells, said his injuries had 'significantly' affected his life, as he raised concerns that other hospitals using the equipment may not have trained staff properly. 'I have changed my perception of life,' he said. 'I have scars that will last for the rest of my life, causing pain and discomfort. 'This equipment is used in lots of hospitals. That worries me. Are other hospitals using the equipment training their staff to use it properly? 'How could two previous patients have suffered minor injuries and not be noticed? How many other hospitals has that happened? 'I have no personal animosity for the individuals concerned. I know they have been personally upset by the incident. 'If I had been a child or a vulnerable older adult, we could have been talking about a death because of the seriousness of the burn.' Malcolm Fortune QC, representing the trust, said the introduction of the hot dog equipment - which is no longer used by the trust - would have saved the organisation £250,000 over five years but he denied it was brought in as a 'cost-cutting exercise.' The case had already cost the deficit-hit trust around £100,000 and a fine of between £200,000 and £300,000 should be considered, he added. Mr Justice Sweeney said he would determine the amount the hospital will pay at Maidstone Crown Court next Thursday. Addressing Mr Wilcock, the judge said: 'I'm extremely sorry that you have undergone this very, very, very unhappy experience.'","Mike Wilcock was undergoing routine surgery in Maidstone in 2012 .

"'Persecuted': Natalya Page's father Fred is backing his daughter's refusal to dye her hair back to its natural colour . A school sent a teenage girl into isolation because she dyed her hair red. Natalya Page, 14, was and told she could not attend lessons at Kenton Academy, in Kenton, Newcastle, until she had her hair dyed back to a natural colour. Teachers told her she would need to sit on her own with her form teacher, away from the rest of the class. They contacted the pupil's father asking for his permission to recolour his daughter's hair in the school salon. But Fred Page, 44, refused and accused the school of overreacting. Mr Page, a taxi driver, said: 'It’s ridiculous - she’s dyed her hair, not her brain. 'I do understand they have got to look after the image of the school, but how can it affect her education? 'How can they teach them to be different if they are going to put them down for the simplest of things? I just feel as though she is being persecuted.' Miss Page claims that she dyed her hair weeks ago, and that teachers have only just noticed the change. Principal David Pearmain said: . 'Natalya came to school last week with her hair dyed a colour which she . was well aware was against school uniform regulations. 'She was offered the opportunity to dye it back to a more natural colour but refused to do so,' he said. 'She . was also offered the option from our fully qualified and experienced . hair and beauty staff in our own well equipped salon. She and her family . refused this also. 'Therefore . she is being educated in isolation from other students until the issue . is resolved. She is present in school today and has not been excluded at . any time. Facilities: The Academy said it had its own fully equipped beauty salon and trained staff . 'We insist on high standards of dress and behaviour at all times.' Kenton Academy announced plans earlier this week to charge parents if . their children missed lessons. Now, . if a pupil falling into a 'causing concern' category has at least 2.5 . days unauthorised absences, the school will issue a fixed penalty notice . - similar to a parking fine for motorists - to the child’s parents. The parents would then face a £60 fine which would increase to £120 if not paid within 21 days. August 2013: Annalise Wilks, 14, was sent home from Beaumont Leys School in Leicester on the first day of term because her trousers were 'too tight' - along with 25 other children sent home or put in isolation for breaking the 'zero tolerance' uniform policy . June 2013: Chloe Hunter, 12, was put into isolation at Kirkby Sports College in Merseyside because her stud earrings were coloured - and the school only allowed 'plain stud earrings' September 2012: Laura Entwistle, 15, was sent home from Swavesey Village College, Cambridgeshire, because her trousers were too tight around the ankles . May 2011: Pupils at Impington Village College near Cambridge rallied round 11-year-old Chris Whitehead, who wore a skirt in protest at the school's rule against boys wearing shorts in warm weather. He managed to have the no-shorts rule overturned. December 2008: Gemma Dixon refused to send her eight-year-old daughter Alisha to school at St John Vianney Primary School in Hartlepool when it banned her from wearing earrings .","Natalya Page being taught in isolation until she has hair dyed back .

"Anxiety, depression, guilt, sleeplessness, marital strife, drug and alcohol abuse — these are some of the mental health issues facing residents in Newtown, Connecticut, two years after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. Only now is the scope of the psychological damage to children, parents and others becoming clear, and the need for treatment is likely to persist a long time. 'Here it is two years later, and it's still hard to deal with. But, God, you didn't want to know me two years ago,' said Beth Hegarty, a Sandy Hook mother who happened to be inside the school that day with her three daughters, all of whom survived. Scroll down for video . Damage: Only now is the scope of the psychological damage to children, parents and others becoming clear, and the need for treatment is likely to persist a long time . Forever grieving: Jennifer Hensel (left), Jeremy Richman and David Wheeler (right), the parents of six-year-old victims, Avielle Richman and Benjamin Wheeler attend the launch of The Sandy Hook Promise, a non-profit created in response to the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut last year . Trauma: Jimmy Greene and Nelba Marquez-Greene, lost daughter Ana Marquez-Greene in the horror . Hegarty and her girls are among the thousands of people in this close-knit town of 27,000 who have taken advantage of counselling and other programs made available through millions in grants and donations. With the second anniversary of the shooting rampage approaching Sunday, agencies have been working to set up a support system for the next 12 to 15 years, as the youngest survivors approach adulthood. Mental health officials say the demand for treatment is high, with many people reporting substance abuse, relationship troubles, disorganization, depression, overthinking or inability to sleep, all related to the December 14, 2012, attack in which a young man killed 20 children and six educators before committing suicide. And some of the problems are just now coming to the surface. Innocent: White roses with the faces of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting are attached to a telephone pole near the school on the one-month anniversary of the shooting . Face of a killer: On December 14 2012, Adam lanza (left) shot dead his mother, Nancy (right), before heading to Sandy Hook Elementary School to murder 20 children and 6 adult staff members. he then took his own liife . Help: With the second anniversary of the shooting rampage approaching Sunday, agencies have been working to set up a support system for the next 12 to 15 years, as the youngest survivors approach adulthood . 'We've found the issues are more complex in the second year,' said Joseph Erardi, Newtown's school superintendent. 'A lot of people were running on adrenaline the first year.' The Hegarty children have had trouble sleeping and difficulty with loud noises and crowds. Whenever they leave the house, they look for places they can hide in case something bad happens. In February, a school counselor suggested the family seek help because one of the daughters wasn't paying attention in class; she was staring at the doorway. Support: A chalk board column is displayed at the Resiliency Center of Newtown which was founded after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary shootings. The center offers the community mental and emotional health programs that include art, music and play therapy . Hegarty and her children have been receiving support from Newtown's Resiliency Center, an organization formed after the shooting that has seen rising demand for its offerings, which include art, music and play therapy. Hegarty said the programs have helped her become more 'even-keeled.' 'I was super reactive to everything. I would fly off the handle on a whim. I was emotional. I couldn't handle crowds or loud noises,' said Hegarty, who took cover under a conference table during the shooting while the principal and psychologist she had been meeting with died. 'For my girls, there is less running down the hallway in the middle of the night and climbing into my bed. They want to go more places instead of staying at home all the time.' Newtown has received about $15 million in grants from the U.S. Education Department and the U.S. Justice Department to support its recovery. The Newtown-Sandy Hook Community Foundation, which oversees the biggest pot of private donations made to Newtown, has about $4 million left after paying out more than $7 million to the families of the 26 victims and other children who were in the same classrooms but survived. Newtown Youth and Family Services, the main mental health agency, has quadrupled its counseling staff, adding 29 positions in the months following the shootings, Executive Director Candice Bohr said. She said the federal grant money that recently came through will help cover its costs. Jennifer Barahona, director of the foundation overseeing the private dollars, said the group has been spending about $60,000 a month on one-on-one counseling for people who have no insurance or whose insurers won't cover such treatment. She said more people are reaching out for help every day. The Newtown school system is starting a long-term program to teach young people from kindergarten through high school how to handle their feelings. It is also setting up a mental health center at the middle school in January to help those who were affected by the tragedy while in elementary school. Teachers have been trained to identify students who might have mental health problems. Melissa Brymer, director of terrorism and disaster programs at the UCLA-Duke National Center for Child Traumatic Stress, has been consulting with Newtown to develop a plan to make sure the mental health needs are met for another 12 to 15 years. Hegarty said she struggles with survivor guilt, but the Resiliency Center has helped her and her children. 'Are we 100 percent? No,' she said. 'But will we ever be 100 percent? We might not be.'","On Dec. 14 2012, Adam Lanza killed 26  at Sandy Hook, mostly children .

"Ditch the winter woollies for now - respite from the chill is on the way. Despite temperatures plummeting to lower than Lapland in some parts today, next week is set to be much warmer across the UK, with the mercury expected to reach a balmy 13C. Yet Britain woke up to the biggest freeze of the winter yesterday with temperatures  tumbling to almost -8C in parts of Scotland, amid warnings there could be four weeks of snow on the way. And, after the brief let-up, the plummeting temperatures are expected to continue until Christmas, when experts predict the mercury could dip to a shivering -12C. One weather expert even warned that the New Year will start with an Arctic blast to rival the winter of 1963, with five feet of snow and night-time temperatures of -15C in some parts.

In the afternoon, the rain will move south-eastwards, with sunny spells and scattered wintry showers following into the north-west. There will be strong winds, especially in the north. By the evening, the rain will clear from the south east to leave it dry with clear spells. But blustery, wintry showers will continue in western Scotland, with a slim chance of thunder in north parts. There will also be some frost in central areas of Scotland, with strong winds in the north half of the UK.

"TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh was surprised to find psychedelic mushrooms which cause vivid hallucinations growing in the garden at Buckingham Palace. The presenter found the red and white spotted toadstool called Amanita muscaria while filming an ITV gardening show called The Queen's Garden and said: 'I won't be eating any of that.' He was touring the private 40-acre site with ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley and asked him whether the fungus is edible. Professor Crawley replied saying: 'That depends what you mean. It's eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic effects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick. TV presenter Alan Titchmarsh found the hallucinogenic mushroom Amanita muscaria during filming for The Queen's Garden at Buckingham Palace . The red and white spotted toadstool called Amanita muscaria can cause vivid hallucinations and is known for the unpredictability of its effects . 'The old-fashioned thing to do was to feed it to the village idiot, then drink his urine because you get all of the high without any of the sickness.' Titchmarsh jokingly replied: 'I think I'll forgo that and stick to normal mushrooms.' The fungus, also known as fly agaric, contains the psychoactive chemicals ibotenic acid and muscimol and they can be found throughout the UK. Last night a Palace spokesman was keen to point out the fungus is not served to Royals. He said: 'There are several hundred fungi species in the palace garden, including a small number of naturally occurring fly agaric mushrooms. 'As the programme explains, they are beneficial to trees, increasing their ability to take in nutrients.' Last night a Palace spokesman was keen to point out the fungi is not served to Royals. Pictured, Queen Elizabeth II meets guests at a garden party at Buckingham Palace in London in June 2014 . Pictured, Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh talk to Claire Midgley (right), the Deputy Gardens Manager, as they study the new vegetable garden in the grounds of Buckingham Palace in 2009 . He told the Sun: 'For the avoidance of doubt, fungi from the garden are not used in the Palace kitchens.' This type of fungus can often be found growing under birch or pine trees, especially Monterey and Bishop pine which are common in the garden at Buckingham Palace. With permission from Her Majesty The Queen, Alan Titchmarsh spent a whole year exploring the Buckingham Palace Garden, which has a five-century history. On the new TV show, Titchmarsh explains that gardeners actively encourage mushrooms and toadstools. He said: 'Every time they chop something down, they leave out the wood to rot.' During her reign, Her Majesty has made the garden a place where nature thrives. It now plays host to 350 species of wildflower, 83 species of bird and two and a half thousand British species of insect, including butterflies. It's been the garden of Queen Elizabeth II for longer than any other monarch. A rare film from 1937 shows the Queen as an 11-year-old princess with her younger sister princess Margaret, having just moved into the palace. Mr Titchmarsh heard tales about the Queen's childhood from royal historian Dr Lucy Worsley, who explains that the young princesses held a wistful fascination with what was beyond the garden walls. With permission from Her Majesty The Queen, Alan Titchmarsh spent a whole year exploring the Buckingham Palace Garden, which has a five-century history . Amanita muscaria, also known as fly agaric, can cause vivid hallucinations . Amanita muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is one of the most recognisable and widely encountered mushrooms in popular culture. The white-spotted, usually red mushroom is viewed as the quintessential toadstool and can be found throughout Europe and America, often growing under birch and pine trees. The fungus is well-known for its hallucinogenic properties because it has a high level of a psycoactive agent called muscimol. Historically the mushrooms were used by medicine men or ‘shamans’ of north east Asia. There has been much speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in Siberia, the Middle East, India, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia. Fly agarics are known for the unpredictability of their effects as they can change dramatically depending on the habitat and the amount ingested per body weight. Effects can range from nausea and twitching to drowsiness, cholinergic crisis-like effects (low blood pressure, sweating and salivation), auditory and visual distortions and mood swings. It can cause  vivid hallucinations, often making colours seem oversaturated and breaking up the boundaries between objects. Some users report having spiritual experiences. The fungi are often considered poisonous and a fatal dose has been calculated as 15 caps. The sale of fresh and prepared magic mushrooms containing psilocin or psilocybin has been illegal in Ireland since January 2006.","TV presenter found fungus called Amanita muscaria at the Palace gardens .

"Pulling a stunt like this could get you labelled as loopy – but the man with jet-powered wings doing stunning aerial gymnastics with a plane knows exactly what he’s doing. He’s ex Swiss fighter pilot Yves Rossy – aka Jetman – and a new video of him showing off his aerial skills has emerged. Rossy was filmed 5,000 feet above the Dubai desert at speeds of up to 120mph in an incredible formation flight with aerobatics champion Veres Zoltán. Scroll down for video . Stunning: A new video of Jetman has emerged, in which he flies in formation with aerobatics champion Veres Zoltán . Jetman became the first and only man in the history of aviation to fly with a jet-propelled wing in 2006 . At one point the plane loops round him as he arrows forward, then the manoeuvre is reversed and he loops round the plane as it flies in a straight line. Another Jetman appears at the end of the video dressed in a yellow outfit – but his or her identity remains a secret. A spokesman for Jetman told MailOnline that the video is an appetiser for ‘something bigger and louder’ in 2015, and wouldn’t reveal any more than that. According to his website, he became the first and only man in the history of aviation to fly with a jet-propelled wing in 2006. Rossy was first a military pilot and then worked as a captain on commercial flights. A spokesman for Jetman told MailOnline that the video is an appetiser for ‘something bigger and louder’ in 2015 . Loopy: The plane rolls over Jetman as he arrows through the sky . Jetman's custom built flight suit weighs almost 55kg and has a wing span of two metres . Daredevil: Jetman has been wowing the world for several years with his stunts. Pictured is another eye-popping moment from his latest video in Dubai . Mystery: At the end of the video someone in a yellow suit appears . His website said he 'has always dedicated all his free time to flight and experimented with all its forms', creating a harness with inflatable wing panels that he subsequently developed into a rigid wing with four engines. He has completed flights over the Swiss Alps - including Lake Geneva in 2002 - and, in 2008, he crossed the English Channel in the flight path of Louis Blériot. His invention has now been refined, so 'all he has is an altimeter for safety, and a tiny throttle control in his hand'. He flew next to a 1940s' Breitling Douglas DC-3 over Lake Lucerne in Switzerland in 2012. 'Jetman' Rossy flew fighter jets for the Swiss air force for 17 years. His custom built flight suit weighs almost 55kg and has a wing span of two metres. He has also previously soared over the Grand Canyon for eight minutes.

"Shoppers have been warned about the dangers of buying budget car seats online after it was revealed one model was available to buy through Amazon despite failing every single UK safety test. The Paibi Baby Bear car seat was supplied directly from China but could be bought by UK customers via Amazon, and can be shipped over to this country via several other sites. That is despite the seat being outlawed for failing all the safety tests required for a seat to be sold in this country, putting children at risk of being killed. The Paibi Baby Bear car seat was available to buy on Amazon's UK site despite being outlawed in this country for failing every single crash test . Rather than being made from a hard casing like most UK approved car seats, the Paibi seat was made of nothing more than fabric. It also has four straps attaching it to the car seat, which violates UK regulations stating that every seat must have only one catch to release it so it can be removed from a car quickly after a crash. In order to be sold in the UK car seats must pass two crash tests, one front-on at 30mph, and another from the rear at 20mph. Crash dummies are strapped into the seats and sensors are used to measure damage, which must be below certain levels. Passing such tests will allow a seat to go on sale in this country, but road safety groups will usually carry out additional tests before giving each seat a rating. A Trading Standards at West Sussex council said: 'Foreign companies with no EU presence are increasingly advertising in the UK and shipping direct to customers. Rather than a hard casing the Paibi was made only from fabric and is held down by four straps despite regulations stating seats must have a single release strap so they can be removed from cars quickly . 'Such companies are incredibly difficult to regulate as they are not subject to UK law. 'We are aware of similar car seats that have been tested and this has shown that they provide totally inadequate protection and I have no doubt that in a car accident there is a strong possibility that any child in one would be killed.' James McLoughlin, spokesperson for road safety charity Brake, said: 'Child seats are subject to strict safety standards for a reason, and can save a child's life in the event of a crash. 'A child in a sub-standard seat would be at much greater risk of death or injury than if they were in a seat that meets UK safety requirements. 'We strongly advise parents to buy the safest seat available.

"A raging inferno engulfed a southwest Ohio home early Friday, killing three children as their mother screamed for help and their father tried in vain to rescue them. The parents, Crystal Flores and Michael Ortiz, and their two other kids, boys ages 9 and 2, were taken to hospitals. The blaze killed another boy and his two older sisters, said Deputy Chief Ken Runyan of the Hamilton Fire Department. Deadly inferno: Firefighters stand outside the Hamilton, Ohio, home where an early morning fire killed three children and sent their parents and two other kids to hospitals Friday . Loss: Leonardo Flores looks on to the house where an early morning fire killed two of his nieces and a nephew . Innocents: The trio of kids who were killed in the house fire were identified Friday as (L to R) Yesenia Flores-Ortiz, 12, Siclalia Flores-Ortiz, 10, and Alexander Flores-Ortiz, 7 . The casualties were identified Friday afternoon as Alexander Flores-Ortiz, 7; Siclalia Flores-Ortiz, 10, and Yesenia Flores-Ortiz, 12. Firefighters using ladders found the children on the second floor of the home in Hamilton, about 20 miles north of Cincinnati. Hurt: The children's mother, Crystal Flores, was taken to a hospital with injuries . Their father was flown to a Cincinnati hospital after emergency responders found him as he tried to reach the children. He was burned and expected to remain hospitalized for days, said his brother, Leonardo Flores. The children's mother, Crystal Flores, and a 9-year-old boy were taken at a local hospital. A 2-year-old boy was sent with them. The mother was released from the hospital at 6am. Her 9-year-old was not harmed in the fire. Neighbor Liz Delk, who lives down the street, recalled getting up for work around 2.30am, peering out the window and seeing the woman running from the home at 135 Franklin Street. 'We heard her screaming and it was just up in flames,' Delk said, adding, 'There was nothing that could be done.' Several neighbors called 911, and fire trucks were there within a few minutes, Delk said. Authorities had no immediate information on what caused the fire, which will be investigated by the state fire marshal's office. According to Mr Flores, who is Michael Ortiz's brother, his sister-in-law told him the family's Christmas tree had sparked the blaze, reported The Journal News. Holiday tragedy: Officials will investigate the cause of the fire, but according to a relative, the deadly blaze was sparked by the family's Christmas tree . Firefighters using ladders found the children on the second floor of the home on Franklin Street in Hamilton . Flores, who is among a large group of relatives that live along the same street, also said that the family had lived in the home for a while. He was quiet as he and others surveyed the scene later Friday morning. 'I feel very bad,' said Flores, 40. 'This is my family.' Debbie Batchelder knew the children from volunteering with an independent Christian ministry in the neighborhood called Freedom Chapel. She said the children often attended Wednesday evening gatherings where they would read Bible stories, make crafts and eat with other children, most of them Mexican-American. She said that when this Wednesday's session ended, the family's 7-year-old, Alexander, told her: 'You didn't give me a hug!' So she hugged him. 'That was the very last thing he said to me,' she said outside the home Friday. 'It's heartbreaking. You feel helpless.'

"When it comes to the most important food items on the Christmas table, the nation is divided. And, as unlikely as it may seem, Brussels sprouts are what brings Britons together as almost half of us (48 per cent) believe it is the most important item for the festive feast. The often derided vegetable is as the nation’s fourth most essential food and drink item for 25 December, new research from Morrisons revealed. What's important? The infographic reveals what the country will be eating on Christmas day . Turkey, stuffing and potatoes make up the top three of the study which also showed that Londoners can't do without cheese - with a quarter claiming it is the most important food on the festive table . The survey of 4,000 Britons called The Great British Christmas Table highlighted how Brits will be celebrating Christmas. It found 24 per cent will be getting into the Yuletide spirit with a glass or two of Baileys, while munching their way through a tin of either Quality Street or Roses chocolates. Drinks choices vary between regions more than any food item - with 12 per cent in the East Midlands proudly drinking sherry, compared to three per cent in the North East. Londoners say that wine is the most essential tipple for the big day (48 per cent), while those in the North East prefer beer or cider (36 per cent). Cheese also splits the nation when it comes to the Christmas dinner table. Those in the capital are the nation’s biggest cheese lovers, but in the South West only 16 per cent will be found championing cheese. Revellers in the capital are also among the most adventurous with their meat. Almost a quarter of Londoners (24 per cent) say they would spend a little extra on other meats such a goose while only 18 per cent in the East Midlands will venture away from traditional Christmas turkey. Fifty-seven per cent of people from the North East plan to savour sausages with their dinner but  only 38 per cent of people in Northern Ireland will do the same. Over 60 per cent of people from the capital wouldn't dream of adding bacon to their meal while almost half of Brits (48 per cent) in East Anglia embrace it.","Morrisons study also revealed wine, Baileys and beer most popular tipples .

"A man who left comedian Russell Brand speechless on Question Time by ordering him to stand for Parliament is the brother of a UKIP MEP. Robert Carver accused the comedian of being all talk during the deabte, and said if he was going to campaign on issues he should stand for parliament so he could effect real change. The comments initially left the outspoken Brand lost for words, but it now seems they may have been politically motivated, as Mr Carver's brother is James Carver, the UKIP MEP for the West Midlands. Scroll down for video . Robert Carver, who is the brother of UKIP MEP James Carver, left comedian Russell Brand speechless when he ordered him to stand for parliament during his appearance on the BBC's Question Times . Brand was joined on the panel by Nigel Farage, Mary Creagh, Penny Mordaunt and Camilla Cavendish . Mr Carver, from Chislehurst, told Brand: 'Stand! Stand for Parliament. If you're going to campaign, then stand, OK? You have the media profile for it.' Brand replied: 'My problem would be mate, I'd stand for parliament but I'd be scared that I'd become one of them.' Mr Carver, who clutched a walking stick, also defended UKIP leader Nigel Farage during the Canterbury debate after Brand accused the UKIP politician of criticising the disabled. He said: 'I've never heard him criticise the disabled OK? Never.' Mr Carver confirms his sibling relationship on his Facebook page. And last month a guest blog 'What I know about UKIP supporters in debates' appeared on a website written by a man named Rob Carver, who said he was the brother of the West Midlands MEP. A bio beneath the post also states: 'Rob has been asked by UKIP to stand as the party candidate in the Tory safe seat of Beckenham at the general election.' Mr Carver's brother is James Carver, the Ukip MEP for the West Midlands, it has been revealed . Mr Carver also defended Mr Farage during the Canterbury debate after Brand accused the UKIP politician of criticising the disabled, something Mr Carver said he had never heard him do . On another post on the UKIP Facebook page in June, Mr Carver said: 'My brother Jim Carver, was elected as a MEP for The West Midlands, and is in the process of taking his seat at the moment.' Care assistant Damion Steele, from Merseyside, said he knew the men were brothers. The 23-year-old said: 'A friend of mine knows the guy and asked if I would tweet Russell Brand because he doesn't want to be involved. 'Everyone is praising him for standing up to Russell Brand but if he has links to UKIP then the public should know about it.'","Robert Carver's brother James is the UKIP MEP for the West Midlands .

"A young mother with two adopted Ethiopian children has shared the heart-melting story of when her autistic son was having a meltdown in Trader Joe's - and a store employee ran up and gave her flowers. In a post for her blog, Lauren Casper - who lives with her family in Lexington, Virginia - said her young son Mareto was having a screaming temper tantrum while the family shopped at the grocery chain. As they rushed from the store, Mrs Casper said she felt 'close to tears' from embarrassment and wished they could be 'invisible to the people bustling around us.' Just before Mrs Casper - who was also carrying her baby daughter Arsema at the time - reached the car, a young female employee approached her with a huge bouquet and said: 'I was adopted as a baby and it has been a wonderful thing. We need more families like yours.' A beautiful family! Lauren Casper with her daughter Arsema, son Mareto and husband John (left to right) They can be a handful! Despite some bumps in the road, Mrs Casper calls her family's situation 'a dream come true' Mrs Casper said she had to stop herself from crying while thanking the woman, who patted her on the shoulder, told her that her family was beautiful and walked back into the store. 'My steps were much slower as I finally headed to the car with my arms full of flowers and tears that had spilled over onto my cheeks,' she wrote. 'On a day when I felt like we were the worst example of family... a day when I hoped no one noticed us... she did. But she didn't see what I assumed everyone was seeing. She didn't think what I assumed everyone was thinking. She saw beauty and love and hope and family. She thought we were wonderful and it made her smile.' Alas, Mrs Casper did not get the employee's name, but wishes now - two years later - she could go back to the store and tell her how meaningful her gift still is. 'To the beautiful young woman in the parking lot of Trader Joe's... thank you from the bottom of my heart,' she said. 'You are a treasure.' Daddy's girl! Mr Casper kisses their young daughter Arsema . Sweet little guy! Mrs Casper and her son Mareto, who was having a meltdown in the Trader Joe's when the store employee came up and gave her flowers . Mrs Casper and her husband John Casper, who's a pastor, met in college, married soon after and planned to have children right away. After a year of trying to conceive, Mrs Casper finally got pregnant, only to lose the baby a few months later. Again, she would get pregnant - and, again, she would miscarry. 'Some people just can't have kids and you need to accept that,' said Mrs Casper, quoting her doctor, in a video about the family's story. The pair then became foster parents to twin two-year-old boys - and, a few months later, a judge ordered them to return to their families. 'I'd had to say goodbye to all of our babies,'  Ms Casper said, through tears, 'and I just really needed one that I could keep.' The Caspers then began the adoption process - and successfully adopted Mareto and Arsema within a few years. Though both of the children have unique needs (Mareto has autism and Arsema has a few missing and webbed fingers and toes), Mrs Casper calls their family's situation 'a dream come true.' 'Life is very sweet and rich,' Mrs Casper said. 'This is all we've ever wanted. We're okay with whatever comes.'","Lauren Casper and husband John Casper adopted their two children from Ethiopia .

"Former head teacher James Stewart has been arrested over £40,000 of expenses claims . The former head of a failing school has been arrested over £40,000 of expenses claims – including a wine club subscription and Virgin Media package for his home. James Stewart, who made £120,000 a year as the academy's principal, was quizzed by police after a Government watchdog said he received £39,026 of 'irregular' payments. It said the sum included £25,544 spent on 'alcohol, hospitality, shopping, gift cards, home appliances/furnishings'. Of this, £3,593.62 was 'directly attributable' to alcohol, including the wine club subscriptions. Investigators said the 'potentially irregular expenditure' also included £2,934.84 in direct debits to mobile phone companies and to Virgin Media for a home package.

Dramatic: 92-year-old Salvatore Mancuso, who was saved by a group of bystanders after he crashed his car into the canal on Wednesday (pictured), passed away on Friday, police have said . Without a second thought: Alton Brieske, who smashed the window of the car open to save Mr Mancuso from the sinking car, said that when he saw the car drive into the water he just acted on instinct . Seeing the car sinking, Brieske and a friend, Michael Markisello, jumped into the water, grabbed a hammer and smashed the window, dragging Mr. Mancuso to the shore where they performed CPR. 'I immediately just took my shirt off and took my shoes off and just dove into the water,' Brieske told CBS 12. 'I started shouting, 'I need a hammer! I need something to break this window so I can get in and pull him out.'

Police said afterwards that Mr. Mancuso likely suffered a loss of consciousness before the accident. Brieske, who was called a guardian angel by his friend, was humble about his brave rescue. 'I was just in the right spot at the right time. I mean, yes, it was a heroic act if that's what you want to call it. But, I was just doing what anybody else would do,' he said.","Salvatore Mancuso passed away in hospital on Friday, two days after he was rescued from a canal in Port St. Lucie, Florida by a group of strangers .

After opening the garage for her, Mr Gaskell said he returned to his other house to continue laying down flooring and was startled to later find his ex-wife in the kitchen. An argument broke out between the two and Mr Gaskell said he told her that she was 'not getting the house'. She then picked up three kitchen knives and splayed them across her chest before walking towards him while running two blades together, he said. 'I yelled at her `put the knives down, put the knives down',' he said. 'She had the serrated blade knife in her right hand and a straight blade in her left hand.' He said she swung at him and slashed his wrist. He then picked up another knife, which he described as flimsy and tried to 'get her back'.

"If your average slip and slide doesn't give your enough of a thrill, then this terrifying waterslide is the ride for you. The awe-inspiring SkyCaliber loop de loop waterslide, developed in Missouri, will break three world records when it opens next year. It boasts the first vertical freefall, the tallest vertical loop and the fastest ever speed in a waterslide. And its creator Lance Fisher claims the idea for the record-breaking ride, which puts thrill-seekers in a safety cage, came to him in a dream in 2012. Scroll down for videos . The SkyCaliber loop de loop waterslide on a testing ground in Missouri, USA which is set to break three world records when it opens next year . The terrifying ride, developed in Missouri, boasts the first vertical freefall, the tallest vertical loop and the fastest ever speed in a waterslide . At 30ft, the vertical loop is the tallest in a waterslide and thrill-seeking riders are dropped from 90ft high in a safety cage . A point-of-view recording shows a person testing the SkyCaliber loop de loop waterslide which needs a roll cage to keep the punters safe . Mr Fisher, who is President of Skyturtle Technologies Ltd, dreamt that he was in a drop capsule and when the floor dropped out he saw the slide was straight down so he grabbed the walls of the capsule and it came down with him. As soon as he woke up, he jotted the idea for the waterslide in his notepad and set to work on the SkyCaliber. It then took more than a year and a half to construct the ride. Adrian Duke, CEO of Avalanche Waterslides Inc, who manufactured the ride, said: 'It is a 100ft tower, the rider is launched from 90ft down a completely vertical free fall that leads into a 30 foot tall vertical loop! You can experience the thrill of riding the SkyCaliber without the actual adrenalin through this point-of-view experience filmed by a tester . Riders of the crazy ride will experience a 45ft vertical drop which starts from a stomach-churning 90ft high . 'It reaches speeds over 50 miles per hour and over 5Gs.' He added: 'SkyCaliber will be the world's fastest waterslide. It will also be the first vertical freefall and tallest vertical loop in a waterslide. 'All of these records are pending Guiness World Records measurement but we have internally confirmed these.' But Mr Duke added despite the fear-inducing specifications, the ride is completely safe. 'We have undergone extensive testing and engineering to ensure that riders are safe. 'We designed and patented the raft which is the innovation that allows the rider to be safe when completing a vertical loop. 'We have also added in mesh siding so that the riders cannot put their hands out and touch the slide at the same time as maintaining airflow so that the rider isn't claustrophobic and still gets wet, after all it is a waterslide.' 'We can confidently say that our testing to this point has proven that the concept is very safe and the ride experience is unrivaled in the water park industry.' 'SkyCaliber will be the world's fastest waterslide. It will also be the first vertical freefall and tallest vertical loop in a waterslide,' said the manufacturer .

"The festive getaway is a notoriously busy time on Britain’s roads. But families planning car journeys face added misery this year – with a staggering 403 roadworks projects going on during Christmas week. The M4, one of the main routes to and from Heathrow Airport, is the worst affected motorway with 34 scheduled works. While the M40, between London and Birmingham, has six planned disruptions in the lead-up to Christmas. There will be added misery for families planning to travel during Christmas week with 403 roadworks planned . The M1, which connects London with the North, is also likely to be slow-moving in places, along with the M25, M6 and M5. Churchill car insurance analysed data from the Highways Agency to compile a list of the roads affected. Of the 34 scheduled disruptions on the M4, 14 – or 41 per cent – will result in moderate delays, expected to slow motorists down by up to 30 minutes. A Churchill spokesman said: ‘The M4 is one of the major routes to and from Heathrow Airport and as such we suggest that drivers check traffic reports as well as allowing additional travel time if they are catching a flight before Christmas Day.’ The report adds: ‘Those travelling in and around London should also be aware that the M25 has 16 planned road works in the week leading up to Christmas, two of which are expected to cause moderate delays of up to 30 minutes.’ The most disrupted ‘A’ road in the UK will be the A5 with 20 disruptions of which more than half are expected to cause drivers delays of up to 30 minutes. The M4 will be the worst affected, with 34 scheduled works, followed by motorways - M1,  M25, M6 and M5 . It urges motorists to ‘plan ahead’ and if need be seek alternative routes such as the A55 which runs parallel to the A5 in parts of Wales. The A12 is the second most disrupted arterial road, followed by the A1, A421 and the A34. Lane closures are expected to be the most prevalent type of road disruption, with 173 planned lane closures between December 18 and Christmas Day. This is followed by carriageway closures - 134 disruptions - and width restrictions - 26 disruptions. The M4 tops the list for the most lane closures with 21, this is followed by the M25 and M6 with 14 closures each. Churchill Insurance warns that anyone travelling between the Midlands and London should allow for additional time for their journey, due to the delays they may face from lane closures. The report also notes: ‘Anyone travelling between London and Birmingham on Christmas Eve should be wary of the M40 as the motorway has four planned road disruptions which will likely cause severe delays of more than 30 minutes.' Steve Barrett, head of Churchill Car Insurance, said: ‘Christmas is one of the few times in the year when whole families are able to get together, so at peak times, there is extra activity on the roads. ‘Our analysis shows that there are hundreds of road disruptions planned in the week before Christmas. 'Motorists should plan their journeys in advance and consider alternative routes, allowing more time for their travel, as there will inevitably be significant delays.' A spokesperson for the Highways Agency said: . 'As usual, the Highways Agency will be helping drivers with their festive journeys by lifting or completing roadworks in time for the holidays. By December 23, 97.5% of our network will be free of roadworks, with 400 miles of roadworks lifted, and just 60 schemes remaining (which need to remain over the holidays for safety reasons). 'From our experience, drivers plan their Christmas trips in the week before December 25, and, traditionally, we release information on our roadworks embargo and update our website around this time. We also provide a map showing the location of each scheme which will be completed or lifted during the festive break.'","Families planning Christmas journeys face added misery this year .

"Authorities in London's Epping Forest have been stopping and searching walkers in an attempt to catch foragers who are stripping the woodland of fungi. Forest keepers are trying to crack down on the harmful practice after gangs of foragers descended on the woodland in vans to cart away hauls of mushrooms which are then sold to restaurants. The plants can fetch up to £50 per kilo as the trend for foraged food in upmarket restaurants in London and around the country has sent demand soaring. Forest keepers in Epping Forest have been frisking walkers using stop and search powers to crack down on foragers (pictured, one man was caught trying to take this haul of fungi out of the woods) Last year 20 people were prosecuted for illegal mushroom picking in Epping Forest, and one man was caught trying to cart 20 bags of fungi out. Forest bylaws prohibit taking anything from the woodland except small pieces of dead wood without the consent of authorities. Forest keepers are attested constables, and so will likely be using Police and Criminal Evidence Act legislation which allows them to search people if they have reasonable suspicion a person is carrying something illegal. The City of London corporation, which manages Epping Forest, is warning that removing huge amounts of the plants is damaging the forest and putting rare species under threat. By-laws prohibit taking anything from forests without the consent of the authorities responsible for managing it. Forest keepers are attested constables, and so are using Police and Criminal Evidence Act legislation, which allows them to stop and search anyone who they suspect is carrying anything illegal. The Epping Forest Act 1878, which passed control of the forest from the Royal family to the City of London Corporation, also allows forest keepers to stop and detain anyone they suspect of breaching by-laws. In particular it is harming ancient trees, some of which are thought to be approaching 1000 years old, as particular types of fungus help to protect their roots. Jeremy Dagley, Epping Forest head of conservation, said: 'Epping Forest has 55,000 ancient trees, each centuries old, and like many plants they have a symbiotic relationship with fungi, which cover the roots and provide minerals in return for starches. 'Around 80 per cent of the ancient beech trees in the country are in Epping Forest and we know their fungi are in trouble. 'Stripping these fungi out on such a large scale can be ecologically damaging and is simply unsustainable. 'We are now seeing fungi foraging on an unprecedented scale. 'Commercial foragers are not selectively picking a few mushrooms for breakfast but hoovering up all fungi species in sight to sort later to sell at markets, restaurants and delis.' Epping Forest, which is around 6,000 years old, is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and used to be a Royal hunting ground before it was passed to the City of London corporation in 1878. While other forests, such as the New Forest, have been hit by foragers, Epping has suffered particularly because of its links to London, meaning it can be easily accessed by millions of people via trains and tubes. Around 4.5million people visit the forest every year, according to the City of London Corporation. As well as damaging the forest, pickers are also putting themselves and diners at risk by harvesting everything they come across, including poisonous varieties. Horse Whisperer author Nicholas Evans accidentally poisoned wife Charlotte Gordon Cumming and her brother after cooking foraged mushrooms, and all three eventually had to have kidney transplants . Nicholas Evans, the author of Horse Whisperer, infamously poisoned himself, his singer-songwriter wife Charlotte Gordon Cumming, and her brother Sir Alastair Gordon Cumming, after cooking mushrooms he foraged from Sir Alastair's Scottish estate. But rather than the edible cep mushrooms he thought he had found, he actually cooked up deadly webcaps, putting all three of them in critical condition in hospital. The poisoning was so acute that all three have since had to have kidney transplants. According to the National Poisons Information Service almost 300 people fell ill after eating foraged mushrooms last year, many of them children under 10 who are more vulnerable to the toxins. Dr John Thompson, Director of the NPIS unit in Cardiff, said: 'As the weather starts to change many people will soon be heading out to the countryside to seek out wild food which can be a really fun thing to do. 'But when it comes to wild mushrooms people need to be aware of the very real potential dangers involved, it is always at this time of year that we see a noticeable increase in poisoning cases.' Chef René Redzepi began the fashion for foraging in 2003 when he opened two-Michelin starred restaurant Noma in Denmark. The menu, which is made up of seasonal food foraged from the surrounding countryside, caused a revelation in the culinary world, and diners flocked in, with the waiting list for a table often stretching to three months or more. The acclaimed eatery has also won Restaurant of the Year four times in the last five years, sparking imitators across the globe. Rene Redzepi, and his Copenhagen restaurant Noma, began the trend for foraging when it opened in 2003. The two-Michelin starred eatery spawned hundreds of imitators across the world . In Britain chefs such as Tim Maddams, who used to work at River Cottage alongside Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Mark Lloyd, and Simon Rogan all promote foraging through cookbooks and their restaurants, meaning the trend is growing. Lone foragers are largely only a risk to themselves, often picking and eating poisonous varieties without realising, which can cause deaths in rare circumstances. However the booming demand for foraged food has driven up wholesale prices, with a kilo of mushrooms now worth around £50. That means big business for anyone who can haul enough of the precious fungi away from woodlands around the country. In 2013 one man was caught trying to take 20 sacks of mushrooms from Epping Forest, while another 19 were prosecuted for running similar schemes. Forest keepers  are warning that such large scale operations are wrecking some of our oldest and most precious woodlands, and putting rare species at risk.","Huge demand for foraged fungi has sent prices soaring to £50 a kilo .

"A mother visiting Costa with her six-year-old daughter found a large shard of glass in her takeaway coffee. Charlene Sweeney, 26, was horrified when she discovered the sharp fragment at the bottom of her latte as she went to finish the drink. She returned to the shop in Poole, Dorset, the following day crying as she told the manager what had happened - and has vowed never to use the chain again. Shocked: Charlene Sweeney was horrified to discover a shard of glass at the bottom of the latte she had bought from Costa and has vowed not to use the coffee chain in the future . She said: 'I was really shocked. The chunk of glass was at the bottom and was so heavy that it wouldn't have floated to the top. 'I went back to Costa the next day and cried as I told the manager what had happened. 'I used to be a regular customer in there, going nearly every day, and now I will never go in there again. 'I understand that they are really busy in Costa but they have a duty of care to their customers.' After discovering the shard of glass, Ms Sweeney immediately checked her daughter Tiya's babyccino - a drink for children made from frothy milk - but to her relief did not find any glass inside it. She has since handed the shard to environmental health officers so that they can investigate - and says she will avoid Costa from now on. Dangerous: The huge chunk of glass has been handed to environmental health officers to investigate . A spokesman for Costa, Britain's largest coffee chain, said the incident was a one-off and that they had given Charlene a £100 voucher to apologise. He said: 'Our area manager has spoken to Ms Sweeney and apologised for the distress this obviously caused her. 'This was an isolated incident and does not reflect our high standards of safety and hygiene.' Jeff Morley, an environmental health officer from Poole council, said an investigation had been carried out and no action would be taken against Costa. He said: 'An officer visited Costa Coffee following the complaint. 'The piece of glass did not match any glass in the premises and the manager was not aware of any breakages. 'The staff are following the company procedure in respect of any breakages and we are not taking any further action.'","Charlene Sweeney had bought a latte from Costa shop in Poole, Dorset .

"A new book contains hundreds of images, both black-and-white and in color, showing John F. Kennedy's 1960 quest for the presidency. The photos show multiple events, including Kennedy speaking on the campaign trail, supporters carrying signs at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, Kennedy at his presidential inauguration, and the soon-to-be president even at a grocery store. Kennedy's wife, and future first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, is also seen, as well as his younger brother Bobby Kennedy. The images are included in Taschen's recently published 'Norman Mailer. JFK. Superman Comes to the Supermarket.' Spread throughout the 370-page book is the text of Mailer's 1960 essay 'Superman Comes to the Supermarket,' which is widely considered part of the 'New Journalism' style. An introduction for the book, penned by J. Michael Lennon, says the ideal for Mailer's article came from Esquire editor Clay Felker. Though Kennedy believed television helped him win against Republican candidate Richard Nixon, Norman Mailer thought it was his own essay, a release for the book notes. Mailer said in a 1962 Esquire issue 'So if I came to the cool conclusion I had won the election for Kennedy with my piece in Esquire, the thought might be high presumption, but it was not unique. I had done some-thing curious but indispensable for the campaign — succeeded in making it dramatic. 'I had not shifted one hundred thousand votes directly, I had not. But a million people might have read my piece and some of them talked to other people. The cadres of Stevenson Democrats whose morale was low might now revive with an argument that Kennedy was different in substance from Nixon. Dramatically different.'

"A crew member and two contractors died when a fire broke out aboard a luxury cruise ship docked at the eastern Caribbean island of St Lucia yesterday morning. The 656 passengers and 400 crew members aboard the Oceania Insignia were evacuated safely and the remainder of the cruise was cancelled, according to operators Oceania Cruises. One crew member, from the Philippines, remains in hospital in a stable condition after the fire broke out at around 8.30am. A fire broke out in the engine room of the Oceana Insignia, though it is not yet known what caused the blaze . But a fellow crew member, also from the Philippines, and two contractors died in a local hospital after being caught up in the blaze, which began in the engine room and was contained. Jason Lasecki, senior director of public relations for Prestige Cruise Holdings, the parent company of Oceania Cruises, said it is not yet clear what caused the fire. He said: 'We are deeply saddened by the tragic events that occurred on Insignia.' 'We have extended our heartfelt condolences to the families of those involved and are offering them our full support. 'This is truly an emotional time for all of us at Oceania Cruises. We are grateful there are no other crew injuries.' Passengers will be fully refunded and charter flights have been arranged to take them to Miami, where accommodation will be found for them until they can be flown home. The liner was docked in St Lucia, to where passengers and crew were evacuated following the fire . Oceania's president and chief operating officer Jason Montague and other officials are in St Lucia. The Foreign Office said it was aware of the incident but no British nationals were among the dead. It is not known how many of the ship's passengers were British. The US National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending officials to help with the investigation, which was being led by the Marshall Islands, where the ship is registered. St Lucia police declined to comment, and the island's fire officials could not be reached for comment. The Insignia had departed San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Sunday for a 10-day cruise and was scheduled to arrive in Miami on December 17. The ship was built in 1998 and underwent a multimillion-dollar refurbishing earlier this year. It rejoined the Oceania fleet in May after operating as a charter for two years, according to Oceania.","Crew member and two contractors died aboard the Oceana Insignia .

"Prime Minister David Cameron has left political talks in Northern Ireland claiming that no deal between the opposing sides is possible, with Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams branding the attempt as 'amateurish and ham fisted'. Mr Cameron and his Irish counterpart Enda Kenny held late-night talks with the major Northern Ireland political leaders in Stormont which ended at 1.30am. The pair returned to the talks at 8am but left within an hour. The two prime ministers had been expected to remain at the talks for the rest of the day before returning to London and Dublin respectively. David Cameron, right, and his Irish counterpart Enda Kenny, left, leaving Belfast today after the failed talks . Mr Cameron, right, and Mr Kenny, left, held late night talks with all the main Northern Ireland political parties . Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams attacked the handling of the talks by the British and Irish governments . The two governments tried to convince local political leaders to compromise over the issue of welfare reform. Mr Cameron offered a £1 billion financial package to the devolved government if they could agree on a deal. Sinn Fein's president Gerry Adams attacked the talks on Twitter: '2 Govts exiting after the most amateurish ham fisted episode I have ever been involved in.' Many of the region’s politicians are unhappy at the scale of the financial offer made, with some describing it as “derisory”. Leaving Stormont House this morning, Mr Cameron said: 'We have made good progress overnight and today but a deal is not going to be possible today.' He said: ‘I was putting on the table, potentially, if a number of things could be agreed, what amounted to almost £1 billion spending power for the Executive over the coming years. Spending power they want to adjust the situation in Northern Ireland, where the state and the public sector is so big and the private sector needs to grow.’ As well as long-standing disputes over flags, parades and the toxic legacy of the past, the five parties in the power-sharing coalition are trying to achieve consensus on budgetary problems facing the devolved institutions, particularly the impasse over the non-implementation of the UK Government’s welfare reforms in Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams, pictured today, described the talks as 'amateurish and ham fisted' The structures and governance arrangements at Stormont are also on the agenda. But the most pressing issue is the budgetary situation. The Northern Ireland executive is stalled over an impasse over the implementation of welfare reforms. Sinn Fein and the SDLP claim that the changes will disproportionally hit the poorest members of their community. The Democratic Unionist Party said it was willing to implement the planned changes. Chancellor George Osborne offered the Northern Ireland Assembly the chance to set their own corporation tax rates - pending an agreement on welfare reform. Prime Minister David Cameron pledged a £1bn package if the main parties could come to an agreement. Unionist and Nationalist politicians also face difficulties over long-running issues concerning the flying of flags and parades. Stormont has already had to seek a £100 million loan from Westminster to plug a major budgetary gap. Unless the parties can agree a budget, the Northern Ireland executive faces bankruptcy. Ministers in Belfast have already had to ask for an emergency £100 million loan from the Treasury to balance their books this financial year, and if a deal on welfare reform is not agreed they will face about £200 million of Government penalties for non-implementation. As it is unlikely the administration would be able to absorb such a financial burden, the future of the Executive effectively depends on a resolution to the welfare reform issue. Mr Cameron said the situation was better than yesterday but 'intensive work' needed to be done to ensure the Northern Ireland Executive's budget was sustainable. 'I think things are better today than they were yesterday I think a deal is possible. It's possible because I think the parties have done a lot of good work on the issues that need to be settled - the issue of how to manage parades, how to handle the past, the issues of flying flags. 'The real work that still needs to be done is to make sure that the budget of the Northern Ireland Executive is sustainable and works, so intensive work needs to be done between the parties on that issue.' With £1 billion of spending power on the table, Mr Cameron said a 'comprehensive agreement' was needed rather than 'simply some words about these issues'. Mr Kenny said he also believed a deal was possible and the politicians 'will be able to conclude the outstanding areas of disagreement on the matters that we have discussed'. The talks will continue today, discussing Northern Ireland's history, the issue of flags, parades as well as welfare reform. Sinn Fein’s Martin McGuinness criticised the offer: ‘Whatever you have been told by the British Prime Minister David Cameron, there was no credible financial package offered to Executive ministers, to allow us to combat the austerity agenda that this British government has been inflicting on us over the course of the last four-and-a-half years.' Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson said that the talks would continue despite Mr Cameron's departure. Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson, centre, told reporters today that his party was ready to continue with the talks despite the departure of British prime minister David Cameron earlier today . Speaking to reporters outside Stormont, the DUP leader said: ‘Anybody who thought we could have reasonably concluded negotiations on a series of issues seriously underestimated the task that we had at hand. As far as we are concerned, the process continues. We have a job of work to do. The absence of the prime minister does not bring that work to an end. There is a responsibility placed on the parties in Northern Ireland by the electorate to get the job done and it is the view of this party that there is still work to be completed. ‘As far as the core issue of the financial issues around Stormont are concerned, I don’t believe that we sufficiently challenged the prime minister in relation to what his bottom line was on financial issues, and we didn’t do that because we had not ourselves been able to complete agreement on other aspects of the financial issues, namely the matter of welfare reform. ‘I think the prime minister would have had more give in him if he had seen that that issue was going to be resolved. I am still unaware what the final position is in relation to Sinn Fein as far as welfare reform is concerned.' Mr Robinson said his party welcomed some of the proposals concerning parades and dealing with Northern Ireland's past. He said he was prepared to continue with the talks: ‘I want to go back down again. I want to ensure that we have done everything possible to reach agreement on those issues. But it is essential in the climate that we are presently in, that we do not squander money, and that means we have a very tight fiscal position to develop, that means we have to resolve the internal financial issues as far as the executive is concerned.' He added: 'We want to continue to see if we can close a deal with the other parties, and I don’t in anyway view this as being the end of the process simply because the prime minister has left to carry out other duties that he has to perform.' A spokeswoman for the prime minister said Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers, pictured, had spent more than 85 hours with the political parties in advance of the current failed negotiations . A Downing Street spokeswoman dismissed Mr Adams' criticism claiming that Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers had been extensively involved in the talks process. She said: 'I think altogether, before they met yesterday, that was 85 hours sat round the table trying to resolve these issues. 'The PM went yesterday and himself spent 10 hours yesterday and a couple of hours this morning trying to resolve the issues. 'The Government is absolutely committed, as the PM said yesterday morning, to taking this opportunity to move forward and make progress, but it is down to the political parties in Northern Ireland to find resolution on issues like welfare reform and so-called legacy issues. 'The offer on the table is £1 billion of financial spending power. That would enable the Northern Ireland Executive and authorities to address some of the difficult reforms that they need to make. That is there for the taking by the political parties in Northern Ireland if they work to resolve the issues. 'There is a heads of agreement document on the table for discussion. What we need to see is progress on those issues which need to be resolved by the political parties.' The spokeswoman said despite Mr Cameron's departure from the talks, the financial offer remained. She added: 'The point about the £1 billion that is on the table is that it will help to address the situation in Northern Ireland, where they need to reform the state and public sector and invest in the private sector and help drive the economy and create jobs. Those are all things that matter to people in Northern Ireland.'","David Cameron left Northern Ireland after offering £1 billion financial deal .

"A school has left parents furious after teachers took dozens of pupils on a forced shopping trip to a shoe store after they arrived for class wearing inappropriate footwear. Parents were sent a bill for the ‘approved shoes’ despite never having asked the school to buy them. The school’s bizarre approach at enforcing its strict uniform policy led to about 40 pupils being driven to the shop by teachers. Scroll down for video . The BBG Academy (pictured) in Birkenshaw, West Yorkshire, ferried up to 75 students who were breaching uniform rules to Wynsor's World of Shoes . Staff at BBG Academy in Birkenshaw, West Yorkshire, even managed to secure a ten per cent discount due to the quantity of shoes they purchased. But angry parents described the school’s uniform policy as ‘ridiculous’. They claim teachers have been placing children in ‘isolation’ for uniform offences and have been lining up girls to inspect their skirts in a ‘military manner’. Pupils were taken to a branch of Wynsors World of Shoes on separate occasions over two weeks after being deemed to be wearing inappropriate shoes. Teachers paid £18 for each pair, which parents were then expected to pay at a later stage. One parent with two children at the school said she thought it was a joke at first. ‘I received a call saying they would take my son for some new shoes and I could pay later,’ she said. Pictured are examples of footwear approved by the school that were available for £18 a pair at Wynsor's World of Shoes . ‘The lady I spoke to at the school seemed quite excited at the fact they were getting 10 per cent discount because they had bought so many pairs.’ On its website, BBG Academy sets out its uniform which is says was developed with 'students, staff and governors'. The uniform was developed to be practical, fashionable and attractive and our students know that conflict over the uniform is inappropriate,' the guidelines say, adding that students should adhere to uniform rules on the way to school, during the school day and on the way home. Boys must wear a school blazer and tie with a white shirt and dark grey or charcoal trousers. It says boys should wear 'plain black shoes' and that trainers, pumps and canvas shoes are not acceptable. Girls must also wear a blazer and tie with the same shoe guidelines as boys except that they are allowed to wear low heel shoes or ankle boots with trousers. Vicca Biggs, 33, whose child is at the school, said that the new uniform policy was ‘undermining parents’. She said: ‘I would be annoyed if one of my kids came back with some shoes and I didn’t know where they came from.’ Mother Diane Coughlan, 46, said: ‘This Monday, they lined all the girls up in an almost military manner and inspected the length of their skirts. They are really clamping down on the poor kids. It’s ridiculous.’ Another parent said: ‘If children don’t have their top button done up, they get put in isolation.’ The school, which has more than 750 pupils, refused to say how many pairs of shoes it had bought but insisted it was providing ‘support’ so pupils could follow rules. Tanya Ratcliffe, 41, the manager of the shoe store, estimated that 40 pupils had been taken to buy shoes by teachers in the past two weeks. ‘When they came in for the first time I recognised the teacher from BBG so I gave them a 10 per cent discount out of goodwill,’ she said. ‘A lot of parents from the school have come in because they don’t want their kids coming with their teachers in school time.’ She said the shop had sold 60 pairs of ‘approved shoes’ to pupils at the school in the past two weeks. Lorna Graham, pictured, supervisor of the Cleckheaton branch of Wynsors World of Shoes, said that the shop runs a scheme where they provide approved shoes for schools . Parents have hit out at the school's actions after only learning of the shopping trip to Wynsor's World of Shoes (pictured) when they were asked to pay the unexpected bill . A supervisor at the store said a teacher had arrived with a group of three pupils on at least two occasions every day last week. School rules state that children must wear ‘plain black shoes’. The BBG Academy was rated inadequate, the lowest possible grade, in its latest Ofsted inspection carried out in October this year. The inspection was the school’s first since becoming an academy in 2012. When it was previously inspected as Birkenshaw Middle School it was deemed to be good overall. The move is believed to be part of the school’s ‘positive discipline’ programme, introduced as a reaction to the Ofsted report. Staff said it was already having a significant effect on pupils’ behaviour. School manager Claire Stephenson said: ‘We are supporting some pupils in ensuring they can follow the uniform policy. We wanted all the pupils to be in the correct uniform. ‘We informed parents before doing this and, on the whole, parents have been very supportive of the behavioural system.’","Eleven pupils at BBG Academy were transported to a nearby shoe shop .

"Megan Buttell can never forget the constant humiliation she felt for the way she looked. Growing up as an obese child with red hair, she was faced with perpetual vile abuse from her peers. The 23-year-old, of Perth in Western Australia, vividly recalls being labelled a 'whale' and a 'fat ranga'. She was once told by a man: 'you're so fat you should kill yourself'. Her way of dealing with the criticism was by living on a diet of chocolate - her only source of comfort. But when she reached her heaviest at 104kg, Ms Buttell decided it was finally time to make a change. Now she feels like a whole new person, having dropped 10 dress sizes after losing 40kg. Scroll down for video . Megan Buttell, of Perth, used to live on a diet of chocolate and never exercised. Although she was unhappy with her body, her only source of comfort was food . Ms Buttell used to weight 104kg and received constant vile abuse for the way she looked . 'I've been overweight all my life and always been bullied,' Ms Buttell told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was a fat kid with red hair and always felt uncomfortable in my own skin.' Her unhealthy lifestyle consisted of chocolate for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 'I'd start off the day having a caramel slice then snack on some M&M's then have a block of chocolate and drink chocolate milk instead of water,' she said. 'I was so obsessed with chocolate, it's embarrassing.' Ms Buttell has gone from a size 20 (as shown in black pants she is holding) to a size 10 . The 23-year-old has lost 40kg - nearly half her original body weight - since she began exercising early last year . Before (left) and after (right) pictures of Ms Buttell who lives in Perth, Western Australia . Exercise was not an option as she was worried it would prompt others to tease her more. 'I never played sport in my life and I didn't even want to try,' Ms Buttell said. 'I also was very lazy that I rolled around on my chair at work to get around the office - instead of walking around. 'But I was so sad about the way I looked and couldn't even go into clothing stores because I was too big for anything in the shop. It was hard to look at myself. Ms Buttell says she used to find it difficult to look at herself in the mirror . The then 22-year-old when she signed up for the gym early last year . 'I didn't even want to eat in public because I was afraid people were judging me.' Her insecurities were heightened by others who mistreated her. Ms Buttell signed up for Goodlife Health Club's 12 Week Challenge and transformed her body . 'People used to call me a whale and shout out ""fat ranga"" as they drove past,' she said. 'Some even asked me if they could stand next to me so they could look skinnier. 'But what was really horrible was when a guy once told me: ""you're so fat you should kill yourself"".' This was the way of life for Ms Buttell - who's 169cm tall - until early last year. 'I jumped on the scales and couldn't believe that I was weighing over 100kg,' she said. 'It's at that point I decided that I need to sort myself out and lose weight.' She eliminated junk from her diet in exchange for chicken and vegetables, exercising for two hours six times a week. That was about 19 months ago, when she signed up for Goodlife Health Club's 12 Week Challenge. Since joining, Ms Buttell has done the challenge four times and has gone from 104kg to 64kg. She was also recently crowned the state winner of the challenge. 'Now I feel like food doesn't control me,' she said. 'I never thought I could be healthy, active and feel so happy about the way I look. 'There's this confidence that I've really felt before. 'If anyone is thinking about losing weight – just do it. You don't know how amazing and life changing it is until you do it and there's really no better feeling in the world.'","Megan Buttell, who lived on a diet of chocolate, went from 104kg to 64kg .

"Airbus may stop making its super-jumbo, the A380, because sales figures have been so poor, the company's finance director revealed. Making its first commercial flight in 2007 to great fanfare, the A380 is the world's largest and most glamorous passenger airliner, with two decks that run the entire length of the fuselage. The A380 has entered service in the fleets of several major airlines, including Emirates, Singapore Airlines, British Airways and Qantas, but the future of the plane was thrown into doubt amid a slump in orders. Scroll down for video . Airbus may stop making its super-jumbo, the A380, because sales figures have been so poor . In an unusually frank remark, Airbus finance director Harald Wilhelm told analysts on Wednesday that Airbus would break even on the A380 through 2018, 'if we would do something on the product, or even if we would discontinue the product'. The unusually frank remark reflected an internal debate over the future of the world's largest airliner but is the first time Airbus has publicly contemplated winding down the project, according to Reuters. It's one of several scenarios that it's contemplating, the agency said. Others include slowing production or investing together with Rolls-Royce in an improved engine. The only new A380 customer Airbus has managed to win this year is lease firm Amadeo shares in Airbus suffered their worst drubbing in more than six years on Wednesday after the planemaker predicted flat profits in 2016. Industry sources said it is in talks to try to shift a handful of planes no longer destined for Japan's troubled Skymark Airlines to larger Japanese carrier ANA. Airbus said it would not comment on specific discussions. At the moment Airbus has 318 firm orders for the aircraft lined up, with 147 having been delivered. The biggest customer is Emirates, which is flying 55 A380s, with another 85 additions to the fleet planned, according to Aviation Week. The site's Managing Editor, Jens Flottau, told MailOnline that  Airbus is facing several issues, including the limit to how many carriers can afford them. He said: 'The A350 and 787 Dreamliner are coming close to the A380 in unit costs so there is little incentive to buy a larger aircraft from the cost perspective. Airlines also shy away from the risk of having to fill another 150 seats per flight. Excess capacity by definition leads to lower fares and often to below-cost fares which airlines obviously seek to avoid. 'The A380 was launched in 2000 and planned in the late 1990s so it is one generation older than the new aircraft. It has four engines, which makes it more expensive to operate and maintain. 'Emirates has become so dominant that a good part of the Europe-Asia market is shifting via Dubai so there is less left for the rest - smaller aircraft are sufficient. 'Finally, it's a huge investment that not many can afford and there's only a limited number of routes that are big enough to justify the aircraft - unless you happen to be Emirates with a huge number of connecting passengers.' The head of Dubai-based Emirates reacted angrily to the suggestion that Airbus might stop making the A380, which took 15 years to develop at a cost of $25billion. Tim Clark told Reuters it could double its investment if the planemaker agreed to upgrade the A380 instead. The A380 has entered service in the fleets of several major airlines, including Emirates, Singapore Airlines, British Airways and Qantas . Cost: £270million ($400m) Length: 72.7m (238 feet 8 inches) Wingspan: 79.8m (261 feet 10 inches) Height: 24.1m (79 feet) Top speed: 587mph . Seats: 469 seats (14 First, 97 business, 55 premium economy,  303 economy) Range: 9,755 miles . Max take-off weight: 560 tonnes . Pilots: Two to four (depending on length of flight) Cabin crew: 22 . Number in BA fleet:  First of 12 on order (Three arrive this year and five more in 2014). Legroom:- 31 inches in economy- 38 inches in premium economy- 6ft long bed in Business class (Club World)- 6ft 6 inch long bed in First Class . Manufacturer: Airbus Industries, ToulouseEngines: Four Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines built in Derby. Wings: Built at Airbus factory in Broughton, North Wales. 'I am not particularly happy as you can imagine,' Clark said. 'We are on the hook for this plane. I get pretty miffed when we have put so much at stake.' Clark said that if Rolls-Royce and Airbus went ahead with upgrading the engines on the A380 Emirates would eventually replace all the 140 superjumbos it has ordered with the newly upgraded version, as fuel consumption would be lowered by 12 to 15 per cent from 2020. But he suggested Emirates would hold Airbus to delivering the A380s it has sold if it decides to halt the programme. Airbus would in that case probably ask Emirates to forego some of its future deliveries, he said, adding, 'That is not a conversation I would like to have'. Clark said he was worried about the effect Airbus's sombre message would have on future A380 purchases by other airlines, as well as the supply chain and the European aerospace industry which has been a darling of politicians by creating jobs. He also said the stance would not help the future second-hand value of A380 aircraft. Clark called on Airbus to step up its A380 marketing efforts, saying it was flying 'full to the gunwales' and making good profits if configured correctly. The aircraft was designed to help airlines cope with airport congestion. 'This is where Airbus needs to be going, to persuade airlines in the long haul business that this definitely has a place,' he said. Airbus immediately sought to defuse the row. 'The entire Airbus top management continues to believe strongly in the market prospects of the A380, but any investment by Airbus requires a sound business case, which we will continue to study,' head of corporate communications Rainer Ohler said. However, Clark raised broader questions about Airbus's strategy for wide-body jets, citing poor sales of the smallest type of A350 and its replacement by an upgraded version of the older A330. Airbus says this has extended a successful product. 'What is happening over there? I would like a first-hand understanding on where they are going,' Clark said, suggesting that Airbus risked being over-dependent on its smaller A320. The sweeping criticism from one of the airline industry's most influential figures will ring further alarm bells in Toulouse, after Emirates recently cancelled an order for A350s. However Clark ruled out a broader decline in the relationship and said Emirates would soon consider making an order for 50-70 mid-sized Airbus or Boeing wide-body jets. He said Emirates wanted to look at in-service performance data on the A350 before deciding whether to place a new order. In January 2012 Australian aircraft engineers called for  A380s to be grounded, after Singapore Airlines and Qantas found cracks in the wings of their super-jumbos. Both airlines, and Airbus, admitted that they had discovered cracks, but maintained that the aircraft were safe. Luxury: A passenger relaxes on a Singapore Airlines A380.

"A Mexican pilot has been sacked after letting a singer into the cockpit and allowing her to fly the plane. Esmeralda Ugalde, 23, and her actress friend Samadhi Zendejas, 19, were let into the cabin by the captain, with pictures later emerging  of the singer sat at the controls.

The Magnicharters pilot, who was flying between Cancun and the capital Mexico City, was identified by the airline and fired. Miss Zendejas tried to defend the captain by saying they had only entered the cabin when the plane was on the ground, but by then the pilot had admitted that he let the young women in during the flight. Company spokesman Jorge Badia confirmed that the captain who allowed Miss Ugalde, sister of Latin Grammy Award winner Ana Barbara, and Miss Zendejas to enter the cockpit had been sacked. Miss Ugalde has since deleted the pictures of her wearing the pilot's cap at the plane's controls . He said: 'We cannot allow a pilot to make this kind of mistake, it is just not allowed. Even if the autopilot was working it is not allowed to do something like this. We cannot even allow people to enter the cabin, even if they are actors or actresses. 'We are a serious company and we are deeply saddened about the fact that one of our staff behaved in this way. Flight law dictates visitors are not allowed to enter the cabin during the flight.' Strict rules imposed following the September 11 terrorist attacks mean pilots are not allowed to let any passengers into the cockpit for any reason, Mr Badia added.","Mexican singer let pilot into cockpit and even allowed her to fly the plane .

"Friends and strangers have donated more than $10,000 to the only survivor of a car crash that killed a young professor and her husband in Upstate New York last weekend: their dog Sawyer. Tatyana Buynitsky, a 28-year-old professor at Simmons College, and her husband, Rory Wingham, 32, were driving on Interstate 88 in Colesville last Friday when they lost control of their car on the icy road and were hit by a tractor trailer. But Finn, who suffered a slipped disc that left him unable to stand or walk, took a turn for the worst a few days later, and Buynitsky's family decided to put the beloved dog down. Left behind: Tatyana Buynitsky, 28, and her husband, Rory Wingham, 32, (pictured at their wedding in November 2013) both died in a car crash last week. Their dog, Sawyer, was the only survivor . However, they also learned that Sawyer had miraculously survived and had been found wandering along a road by a nearby resident, who has now returned him to the mourning family. 'He's the only one who made it out of the accident alive,' Steven Buynitsky, 19, told the Boston Globe. 'Being with him has definitely helped [us] to cope with our loss.' He initially set up the fundraising page to help with Finn's veterinary costs before he was put down. The funds will be now used to cover the two animals' immediate medical costs, and the remainder will be donated to charities and go towards a scholarship in the couple's names. The Buynitskys are also focusing on caring for Sawyer. 'My sister and Rory had so much love for him and we are trying to make him just as happy as he was then,' Buynitsky said. 'We got him back safe with just a couple of scratches so we think he is extremely special.' He added that the family had learned just how much his sister and her husband were loved because of the outpouring of support they have received since the tragedy. Victim: Their other dog, Finn (right), suffered a slipped disc and other injuries in the crash and relatives decided to put him down. Sawyer (left) ran away from the crash scene but was found by a nearby resident . Injured: Relatives initially set up a fundraising page to pay for medical bills for Finn (pictured after the crash), but now they will be donating the money to charities and setting up a scholarship in the couple's names . Staff at Simmons, where Buynitsky worked in the school's Behavior Analysis program, also expressed their heartbreak at the loss of 'a friend, teacher, mentor, and colleague'. 'We are all shocked and saddened by their sudden deaths,' Simmons President Helen Drinan said in a statement on Tuesday. Buynitsky had attended Boston University for her undergraduate degree and received her master's and doctoral degrees at Simmons, which is in Boston. She became a board-certified behavior analyst in 2012. Wingham was born in Johannesburg, South Africa and went to high school in Kent, England before studying at Northeastern University. At the time of his death he was a product manager for software company Intuit and had previously worked for Nasdaq and Thomson Reuters. The couple, who bonded over their love of Disney, became engaged on a trip to Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, and married in November 2013. Another gofundme page set up for the couple's charitable foundation said that they 'gave of themselves selflessly, worked hard to better their communities, and loved their friends, their dogs, and their family with inspiring generosity'. It added: 'They were each in the process of finishing their degrees and launching careers devoted to service and the betterment of those around them.' Loss: Buynitsky worked in the Behavior Analysis program for Simmons College in Boston, while her husband, who was born in South Africa, was a product manager for software company, Intuit . New home: Sawyer is now settling in with Buynitsky's family, who have another dog, Cherry, right . The scholarship in their name will be for students pursuing degrees in Social Work and in Finance and who dedicate themselves and their careers to community service, the page explained. On the evening of the crash, Buynitsky had been behind the wheel in their Honda Civic and attempting to overtake a tractor trailer when she lost control on black ice  around 5.10pm. Their car struck a guiderail and after veering directly into the tractor trailer's path, they were hit by the vehicle, police said, WBNG reported. Wingham was pronounced dead at the scene while Buynitsky was taken to United Health Services Wilson Medical Center, where she later died. The driver of the truck was not injured in the crash and no charges have been filed. State police said that the roads were covered with ice, causing another crash less than a mile away.","Tatyana Buynitsky, 28, and her husband Rory Wingham, 32, were driving in upstate New York last Friday when they collided with a tractor trailer .

"Passengers on a flight from San Francisco to Sydney that was diverted to Canberra were stuck on board for more than 19 hours and stranded on the tarmac for another four. United Airlines flight 863 had to be diverted away from Sydney due to debris on the airport's runway and landed in Canberra at 9am on Friday following the 15 hour journey from the U.S. Because Canberra is not an international airport it does not have customs, quarantine or immigration facilities so the travellers were not allowed to disembark or enter the terminal.

Some passengers  began their journey in New York and said they had been on a plane for 30 hours, the ABC reported. A passenger, who did not wish to be named, told Daily Mail Australia they were kept on the plane and unable to leave their seats for three hours with no food, water and bathrooms. Eventually some snacks were provided by Qantas. Officials allowed the passengers to get off the plane just after 1pm but they had to stay on the tarmac. Once on the tarmac passengers were guarded by Australian Federal Police officers and customs officials. One other United Airlines flight had to be diverted away from the Sydney Airport runway when it was shut between 7.45am and 8.20am on Friday. Officials allowed the passengers to get off the plane just after 1pm after 15 hours in the air and four hours grounded on the plane . A passenger said they were kept on the plane for three hours with no food, until snacks were given by Qantas . That flight was diverted to Brisbane International Airport so passengers were able to disembark. A source said the United Airlines pilots of flight 863 were informed the Sydney runway was clear one minute after they had changed their direction to fly to Canberra, but made the decision to keep going. Daily Mail Australia has contacted United Airlines for comment. Canberra Airport spokeswoman Jane Seaborn said the pilots were unable to fly again after they landed in Canberra at 9am, and there was no crew to replace them when they arrived. An Australian Federal Police vehicle kept an eye on passengers, who were not allowed to leave the tarmac because Canberra Airport has no customs facilities . 'Pilots only have a certain amount of time they can fly before they've reached maximum flying hours, then the compulsory rest period is eight hours,' Ms Seaborn told Daily Mail Australia. 'Then obviously no other United 777 crew was waiting here in Canberra to replace them.' A replacement pilot crew arrived in Canberra around 3.30pm, and the plane took off for Sydney at 5pm. It will arrive in Sydney around 6pm. Ms Seaborn said United had organised for Qantas' catering contractor to provide food, and for a sanitation vehicle to the empty the plane's toilet tanks.","United Airlines flight 863 had to be diverted to Canberra airport on Friday .

"Hundreds of Iraqi students have taken to the country's streets to celebrate National Peshmerga Day - paying tribute to the brave Kurdish fighters leading the country's anti-ISIS resistance. Young men and women in the northern city of Kirkuk, which has come under relentless attack from jihadis over the past few months, wore the force's distinctive red berets and combat clothing as they took part in a parade near the local university. The annual event has taken on new poignancy this year following the rise of ISIS, but it originally started as a way for Iraqi Kurds to mark the moment in December 1945 when peshmerga forces took control of the final remaining military barracks in the Kurd-dominated Iranian city of Mahabad. Celebrate: Hundreds of Iraqi students - many of them women - took to the country's streets for National Peshmerga Day, paying tribute to the brave Kurdish fighters leading the country's anti-ISIS resistance . Parade: Students in Kirkuk, which has come under relentless attack from jihadis over the past few months, wore the force's distinctive uniforms as they took part in a parade near the local university (background) The word peshmerga is a widely used term to refer to Kurdish armed forces, but it is also the formal name of the Kurdistan Regional Government's armed forces in semi-autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan. The peshmerga have existed since the advent of the Kurdish independence movement in the early 1920s, following the collapse of the Ottoman and Qajar empires which had jointly ruled the area. The armed milita has long acted as a security force in Iraq, cooperating with the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 that eventually led to the capture and execution of dictator Saddam Hussein. They have also worked closely with the Americans to target Al Qaeda and its affiliates in Iraq. One of the toughest challenges in the peshmerga's 90-year existence has been the rise of the terrorist group now known as Islamic State, which has been operating in various guises in Iraq for close to 15 years. Over the past year, however, the militants have stepped up their assault on Iraq, dramatically seizing vast areas of land in the west of the country in a lightning advance in early summer. Since then the peshmerga have proved themselves one of the most effective groups battling ISIS, refusing to give in to their fellow Sunni Muslims and even sending a large fighting force over the border to Syria where they have helped fellow Kurds battle the terror group in the city of Kobane. Destroyed: A car bomb blast targeted a Kurdish neighbourhood in Kirkuk left 16 people dead last Friday . Iraqis inspect the site of a suicide bomb attack that hit the Shorja district in Kirkuk last week, killing 16 people . Yesterday's defiant parade in Kirkuk comes just a week after ISIS militants killed 16 people in a car bomb attack outside a cafe in the oil rich city, which lies 180 miles north of the capital Baghdad. The disputed oil hub of Kirkuk is an ethnically mixed city which lies outside the recognised autonomous Kurdish region but is currently under the full control of the peshmerga forces. The last major bomb attack in Kirkuk was in August when triple blasts, including two targeting the Kurdish security forces, left 38 dead. Violence has increased in the Kirkuk region in recent weeks as ISIS fighters are being squeezed out of some of the positions they had held in the east of the country since June.","Hundreds of university students have taken to the streets of Kirkuk in Iraq .

"A New York home has set the world record for having the most number of Christmas lights - a blinding 601,736 spread of bulbs spanning two acres. Timothy Gay from Lagrangeville started putting up festive decorations when his daughter was born in 1995 in a bid to 'make the holidays special'. Over the past 19 years he has continued adding to the dazzling display, and this season he made it into the record books. Scroll down for video . Obsession: Timothy Gay from Lagrangeville, New York, started putting up Chistmas lights on his home following the birth of his first daughter . Record-breaking: Over the past 19 years he has continued adding to the dazzling display, and this season he made it into the record books with a blinding 601,736 spread of bulbs spanning two acres . The full-time engineer, his wife, Grace, and their three children, Emily, Daniel and John, met with an official adjudicator earlier this month. For the record to be set, the lights had to be turned on in the dark for ten minutes with all of the bulbs functioning. 'I started with 600 lights and here we are now with 1,000 times that,' Mr Gay said. His light show consists of twinkling garden ornaments in all the colors of the rainbow. Standout features include giant trees, over-sized hearts and dangling stars. Mr Gay's red brick house is barely visible through the mass of decoration. This year's display took him around two months to build. Dazzling: Mr Gay's light show consists of twinkling garden ornaments in all the colors of the rainbow - standout features include giant trees, oversized hearts and dangling stars . Tourist attraction: The light display is open to the public until December 29, with donations going to charity . The full-time engineer, his wife, Grace, and their three children, Emily, Daniel and John, met with an official adjudicator earlier this month . He also syncs the lights to music and over the years he has wired bulbs up to more than 200 tracks. Some songs can take up to 35 hours to program. Mr Gay actually won the world record for 'Most Lights on a Residential Property' in 2012  but lost the title  the following year. The Richards family of Canberra, Australia, outdid him with an illumination boasting 502,165 lights. However, Mr Gay managed to reclaim the top spot in 2014 thanks to a donation from Ritz Crackers. Commenting on the win, the father-of-three said: 'My family and I are thrilled to bring the world record back to the U.S. and we're even more excited that we did it with nearly 100,000 more lights than the previous record.' The Gay's light display is open to the public daily until December 29, with donations going to charity. The family expect to raise $30,000 this holiday season.","Timothy Gay from Lagrangeville started putting up festive decorations when his daughter was born in 1995 in a bid to 'make the holidays special'

"Accused: Donald Tisher has been arrested and held without bail for a sexual assault against one of his students at San Joaquin Delta College . A former California sheriff's deputy working as a college coach has been accused of sexually assaulting one of his student athletes. Donald Tisher, 56, who is a track and field coach at San Joaquin Delta College, is alleged to have attacked the girl at her home in Stockton. The 18-year-old victim reported to the Stockton Police Department that she was unconscious throughout the attack. 'The specific allegation is digital penetration, which is use of fingers to penetrate the vagina,' said Robert Himelblau, a spokesman for the San Joaquin County District. The former San Joaquin deputy has worked as a coach at East Union High School and is being without bail. He is scheduled to make an appearance in San Joaquin County Superior Court at 8:30 a.m. on December 19. Investigators claim that Tisher knew his vcitm and added that in no way was the relationship a romantic one. Damningly for Tisher, his stepdaughter spoke to local Sacremento news and said she definitely believes he is guilty. Asked if she wanted to stand up for him when approached on her doorstep, she replied, ''F— no—excuse my language—no, no I do not want to defend him in anyway,' to CBS Sacremento.

"The University of Maine changed their minds this week after originally stating they were not going to allow candy canes in common areas on Campus. When Executive Director of Auxiliary Services Daniel Stirrup sent out an email on Monday saying that religious themed decorations including candy canes and Christmas trees were going to be banned from public spaces, students were outraged and were able to sway the school administration in their favor. The school later apologized for banning the decorations and called the whole incident a 'misunderstanding' citing the fact they were merely trying to be inclusive following a student's complaint about Christmas-centric 'religious' decorations. Banned decorations: Administrators at the University of Maine banned all Christmas decorations on Monday . 'We are not the Grinches of Maine, Dean of Students Robert Dana told Fox. 'It was a big misunderstanding. The e-mail was in response to an issue a student had raised. His intent was to be inclusive.' Stirrup originally banned any 'decoration that could be perceived as religious' and listed off items such as ' xmas trees, wreaths, xmas presents, candy canes, etc.' 'What is allowed are winter themes, plain trees without presents underneath, decorative lights, but not on trees, snowflakes, etc. If you are unsure, best to not use or ask me for clarification,' he said in his initial email. Students at the school were so outraged after Monday's email they started a Facebook group dedicated to bringing back decorations on campus called 'Bring Cheer back to UMaine' that now has almost 1,000 supporters. They're back: After students complained about the lack of holiday cheer on campus the school allowed them to decorate with candy canes once again . 'How can we celebrate diversity if we can't even see it? #bringbackthecheer,' the group posted two days ago following Monday's news. 'They didn't have to say it. They took down items put up by students expressing their 1st amendment rights. That is a violation of the Constitution of the United States of America. Whom ever made that decision has opened himself and the college up to multiple lawsuits,' said Arthur Nickerson. The students were eventually able to regain their right to put up decorations and the Facebook group still remains to celebrate the holiday.","Executive Director of Auxiliary Services Daniel Stirrup sent out an email on Monday saying that religious themed decorations were banned .

"For the wealthy owners of a string of care homes, relaxing in the sun on a tropical island is just one of life’s little luxuries. These pictures show Soondressen Cooppen and his wife Maleenee celebrating their daughter’s 18th birthday with a lavish family party on their native Mauritius. But for the elderly residents being charged £500 a week in their care homes there are no such comforts. Neglect: Last night a second care home run by the Cooppens (pictured) was closed on safety grounds . Last night a second home run by the Cooppens was closed on safety grounds. Just three days after pensioners were left outside in their pyjamas on a bitterly cold night when Merok Park Care Home in Banstead, Surrey, was shut without notice, council officials ordered the evacuation of Grantley Court in Sutton. Officers from Sutton Council decided to move residents to other care homes following the closure of Merok Park. It is believed only one resident remained in Grantley Court last night. They will be cared for by staff over the weekend before being moved on Monday. The home was inspected by the Care Quality Commission in September and deemed ‘not safe’, with patients left at risk of infection from unclean equipment and allegations of abuse not reported properly. A Sutton Council spokesman said it had voiced concerns to the CQC last month and made the decision on Wednesday to find alternative care for residents. Soondressen Cooppen and his wife Maleenee are pictured at their daughter's 18th birthday party in Mauritius . On Tuesday, 25 residents were evacuated in their night clothes from Merok Park. Inspectors were so shocked by the squalid conditions that they ordered it to be closed immediately and the pensioners ferried by ambulance to other homes. Residents’ families described Merok Park as a ‘pigsty’. Last night they called for a police investigation and demanded to know why the Cooppens had been able to charge so much for such poor care. Leslie Shields, whose 78-year-old father was a resident, said: ‘Someone needs to be prosecuted over this. Why should those responsible go unpunished? ‘The residents in that home were treated like animals. My father’s legs were covered in sores when he left. There needs to be a police investigation to determine whether there was criminal negligence. ‘And the people in authority who were supposed to be monitoring this home need to ask themselves why they didn’t take action before. Some people will have been using their life savings to pay for this care.’ The CQC, which had given Merok Park a clean bill of health only 11 months earlier, said it was working with the police to see if there was any criminal neglect. Mr Cooppen, 51, and his wife, 42, own a third care home, Faygate House in Sutton, which was criticised by the CQC earlier this year for failing to keep proper records. The couple, who were believed to have been raking in up to £650,000 a year from each home, were unavailable to comment last night. On Tuesday, 25 residents were evacuated in their night clothes from Merok Park Care Home in Surrey . They live in a £2million house on a gated estate in Cheam, where yesterday four luxury cars – including a Bentley Continental – were parked on the driveway. The Cooppens, who take frequent holidays in Mauritius, have three children, the eldest of whom, Davina, 20, is understood to be a student at Cambridge University. For Davina’s 18th birthday, they threw a lavish party. A video uploaded to YouTube shows the family and friends at the C Beach Club in the Domaine de Bel Ombre resort. The CQC shut Merok Park, where some pensioners had their care funded by Surrey County Council, after inspectors found residents being washed in cold water and looked after by poorly-trained staff who had not been CRB checked. They reported an overpowering smell of urine and found that some residents could not leave the top floor because the lift was broken. In September, the CQC gave the Cooppens two months to improve Grantley Court. Inspectors said of the 30-bed home, which specialises in caring for those with dementia and disabilities: ‘People’s dignity and privacy were not respected. Doors were left open when people were undressed or using the toilet and staff did not always knock when entering people’s bedrooms. People were left in soiled, wet or poorly fitting clothing.’ The CQC said that it issued Mr Cooppen with a proposal to remove the home from its register and he had agreed to shut it. However, Sutton Council decided to evacuate residents before it closed. A council spokesman said: ‘The care of vulnerable adults is a top priority and we take our responsibilities as a council very seriously. Our officers took decisive action and reported concerns about care standards with the CQC inspectors. We have already moved residents to new accommodation and are supporting all of the families involved.’ Sally Warren, CQC’s deputy chief inspector of adult social care in London, said: ‘We will take urgent action to cancel the registration of a provider where there is a serious risk to a person’s life, health or wellbeing. At Merok Park, the lack of hot water and broken lift – alongside serious staffing issues found – prompted urgent action. ‘At Grantley Court, CQC took quick action to initiate the normal closure process while keeping the home under careful scrutiny. CQC is working closely with Sutton Council regarding Faygate House and will continue to monitor the situation very closely.’","Soondressen Cooppen and his wife Maleenee photographed on luxury trip .

She said: 'The government has to change its policies on employment. 'The Jobs Act and the budget do nothing to revive the economy and create jobs.' With pressure growing on Italy to meet European Union deficit and debt targets, Renzi's progress is being monitored by EU partners.

"Christmas Day, with its messages of good cheer, will be difficult enough, but the worst moment will be moving out, when she is forced to say farewell to the home she dreamed of living in as a child — a house described as the most beautiful in Britain. For a dozen years, former Marks & Spencer heiress Rebecca Howard has revelled in being described as 'a chatelaine for the 21st century'. The phrase implied an unassailable position as the mistress of Castle Howard, the sprawling Yorkshire estate now 300 years old that was the setting for the epic ITV television drama series Brideshead Revisited, starring Anthony Andrews and Jeremy Irons. But, after little over a decade in that envied role, she is about to spend her final Christmas amid its surprisingly intimate grandeur. It will be, according to one of the family, 'Christmas as usual'. But there will be precious little cheer. Scroll down for video . Rebecca and Simon Howard, pictured at Castle Howard,  are about to spend their final Christmas amid its grandeur . For soon after January 1, she and her husband Simon Howard, 58, who has lived there all his life, and their 12-year-old twins Merlin and Octavia, will have to leave the 18th-century mansion designed by Sir John Vanbrugh, a house that comes with temples, follies, peacocks, 100 staff and 10,000 rolling acres — as well as 250,000 paying visitors a year. To where, no one is quite sure at this moment. 'Wherever it is, Rebecca will feel she's living in the garden shed,' says a friend. It has all been rather sudden. Into their place will sweep Simon's elder brother Nicholas, 62, a photographer, and Castle Howard's new chatelaine, his tough and very business-savvy wife Victoria Barnsley, former £500,000-a-year chief executive of publishing giant HarperCollins. In a move that has divided the wider family, Nick and Vicky are taking over. Why? One clue lies in an anodyne statement from Castle Howard explaining that Nick is preparing 'the next generation of the Howard family to take on the running of the estate'. Nick's son George, 29, whose grandfather was the late comedian Derek Nimmo,  is already a director of the company that runs the estate. 'Some will cruelly say it is poetic justice that Rebecca, great niece of Lord Sieff, former chairman of Marks & Spencer, is having to leave the home of her dreams. For when she married Simon (in the great house, wearing the family's Cartier tiara and attended by a company of liveried footmen and trumpeters) in 2001, she was the object of angry family gossip'. They will be replaced by Simon's older brother Nicholas Howard and his business-savvy  wife Victoria Barnsley . It is certainly true that when she began her affair with Simon Howard he was still married to his first wife Annette — six years his senior and affectionately known to friends as Scruff — though the marriage had been in difficulties for some time. What didn't help was an unflattering profile of Rebecca in Vanity Fair, written by her friend Plum Sykes, which had the headline 'The woman who set out to marry a house'. Under that astonishing headline was Rebecca's own admission that she fell in love with Castle Howard when she was 14 while watching the Brideshead TV series. 'It looked so glamorous and so wonderful and you thought, I'm not going to end up in a s****y little house somewhere . . . I want to live there,' she told Plum. When the Vanity Fair article appeared in June 2002, seven months after she'd become mistress of Castle Howard, she was upset that it portrayed her as a calculating house-huntress. 'I fell madly in love with Simon,' she insisted. But her obsession with Castle Howard was real enough. At 20, as a young heiress and socialite, a glossy magazine asked her where she wanted to live and her instant reply was: 'Oh, somewhere like Castle Howard.' She had to wait until she was 34 to achieve her ambition. Now, 12 years later and aged 46, the dream is over. Rebecca admitted she fell in love with Castle Howard when she was 14 while watching the Brideshead TV series but insisted she also fell 'madly in love' with Simon . But then, this is one of the hazards of spending one's entire trust fund while still in your 20s, as she did, after which the one-time heiress had to work for a living, doing research for royal biographer Hugo Vickers as well as — ironically enough — organising tours of stately homes. Some feel that the timing is cruel, as Simon Howard has been battling throat cancer, from which he now believes he is free. Others think that this handover of power was put on hold until his cancer crisis was over. The fact is that the house could — indeed should — have been Nick's in the first place, but he didn't want it. An older brother, Henry, had a medical condition that required constant attention and was clearly unable to take it on — he died six years ago. Nick was next in line, but at the age of 16 he told his father, Lord Howard of Henderskelfe, former chairman of the BBC, that he wanted to be a rock star. And so, while Nick set out to make it big in music, younger brother Simon was dispatched to the Royal Agricultural College at Cirencester to be ready to take over the estate when the time came. And in 1984, when their father died, take over he did. Meanwhile, despite years of trying, success as a singer and songwriter never materialised for Nick. The closest he got to a rock star's lifestyle was being raided by the drugs squad when he was 21 for possessing what he has described as 'a footling amount of cannabis' with four other members of his group Peaches. It was 1973 and the band was living on social security — and rent-free — in a farmhouse on the estate. Nick was fined £100, and a family story that is repeated to much amusement to this day is how he asked if he could pay it off in three months, only to be told by the chairman of the magistrates: 'This is meant to be a punishment, not hire purchase.' Eventually, he gave up trying to be a rock star and turned to photography, at which he rapidly came to be highly regarded, especially for his portraits and landscapes. He has had two successful exhibitions. The move to turf out Simon, Rebecca and their children is said to have divided the wider family . No doubt those struggling early days living on the estate will provide much nostalgic laughter after he and Vicky move into Castle Howard in the New Year. The couple have been married 22 years and she is his second wife. His first wife, Amanda, with whom he had George, was Derek Nimmo's daughter. She is now married to another photographer, Willie Christie. 'There's always been an edgy relationship between Nick and his brother Simon,' says a family source, 'and their wives have never really got on. I daren't think what Rebecca's view of being replaced by Vicky is. They're very different women who talk about different things. One has always been incredibly pretty [Rebecca], the other has always been incredibly successful [Vicky]. 'I know that when Nick and Vicky used Castle Howard for a big party a couple of years ago — it was a combined 60th birthday for Nick, their 20th wedding anniversary and their daughter Blanche's 18th birthday — Vicky was saying what a wonderful house it was . . . perhaps meaningfully. 'Anyone would love it — it's far more intimate than you think from the outside, with a separate flat in each of the wings. Gorgeous.' While Vicky is known to be 'excited' at testing herself against the demands of running a great house, Rebecca and Simon are 'inconsolable'. To fully appreciate their shock at having to get out, it is worth hearing the description of Castle Howard by Horace Walpole, the great art historian son of 18th-century Prime Minister Sir Robert. He wrote of the Palladian mansion that 'it was possible to see at one view a palace, a town, a fortified city, temples in high places, woods . . . the noblest lawn in the world fenced by half the horizon.' Simon, an irascible figure, has not only lost the house but also his position as chairman of the board, which he has held for many years. Intriguingly, the directorshave replaced him with not one but two co-chairmen — Nick and his wife Vicky. But it is Vicky who will effectively be running the show as she is the new 'executive' co-chairman while her husband is 'non-executive'. Simon, in charge since 1983, steps down to become, like his nephew George, a director, and will continue to help out. 'Putting Vicky in this lofty position is a final dagger thrust in Rebecca's heart as they certainly didn't make her a director, even though she worked as hard as anyone with Simon to make sure the house remained beautiful and a success with the public,' says a close friend. 'She's wounded and angry. This is a sudden life change she never saw coming. It isn't as if Nick and Vicky haven't anywhere else to live — they've got two fine houses already, one near Bath, the other in Bayswater.' For 12 years, Rebecca has woken up to a breathtaking view across the lake. She will see it on Christmas morning, knowing that one day very soon, she will see it for the last time. After all she has been through, it seems she is bound for a 'sh***y little house' after all.","Heiress Rebecca Howard has been mistress of Castle Howard for 12 years .

"A man who raped and killed an eight-year-old girl before stashing her body in a dryer has been found guilty of ten counts including capital murder. Billy Frank Davis Jr, 31, snatched Ahliyah Nachelle Irvin from  the living room of her Topeka apartment as she slept, before sexually assaulting and choking the little girl. Jurors will return to Shawnee County court in Kansas tomorrow to hear more evidence before deciding whether to recommend that Davis receive the death penalty or life without parole. Friends and family of Ahliyah Nachell Irvin weep as Topeka police detective Scott Dickey recounted details of his interview of Billy Frank Davis Jr., front center, who is charged with with killing and rape of the little girl . Ahliyah's parents wept silently as the bailiff read that Davis was found guilty of two counts of capital murder, one count of premeditated first-degree murder and seven other charges, the Topeka Capital-Journal reported. Prosecutors said Davis killed the child in March 2012 to hide that he had sexually assaulted her. But his defense team argued that Davis did not have the mental capability to form the intent to kill the girl because he been drinking and using cocaine. The night before Ahliyah died, she played at a complex playground with other neighbor children and fell asleep in the living room on the main floor of the apartment. Her disappearance led to a frantic search of the townhome and the complex. According to the newspaper, Davis admitted kidnapping Ahliyah and taking her to a basement at the apartment block. He said when she would not quiet down, he choked her until she became quiet then he stuffed her body into a clothes dryer.

During the trial, the dryer in which her body was found was wheeled into the courtroom and shown to jurors. In a handwritten note provided to the Topeka Capital-Journal, Ahliyah's grandmother Sharon Miller wrote: 'Even though Ahliyah will never go to the prom or fall in love, or grow up to have a family, justice has been done to the point that this man will never be able to take another baby’s life, be able to traumatize a family of another victim.' The note added: 'We all still miss the loss of our beautiful Ahliyah, her touch, her smile, her loving hugs but we as a family know she is in Heaven smiling down on us and is happy now and looks down on us letting us know everything is going to be OK now.' Ahliyah's mother, Angela Ortega, left, is comforted by Sherry Mason at Shawnee County court. Billy Frank Davis Jr., 28, front right, is now facing the death penalty . Davis, who was found hiding in a creek bed, had a violent criminal history and had been placed on probation in another case the week before the killing. Family members described Davis as an acquaintance of a family friend and said he had been living at the townhome complex at the time of Ahliyah's death. Police have said Davis told detectives he kidnapped and choked the girl during a flashback to his military service in Iraq. The former coroner who performed the autopsy testified that the bruised girl had a tooth knocked out and that she died from asphyxia.","Billy Frank Davis Jr, 31, snatched Ahliyah Nachelle Irvin from an apartment .

"A Gay policeman is suing Scotland Yard claiming he was taunted for ‘having sex with Michael Barrymore’. PC Dan Lichters said he was embarrassed when fellow officers asked if he had relationships with ‘any other celebrities’. The constable said he became friends with the TV entertainer in 2001 following his arrest after a man’s body was found in his swimming pool. Gay policeman Dan Lichters is suing Scotland Yard for discrimination, harassment and victimisation and claims he was taunted for ‘having sex with entertainer Michael Barrymore’ The 34-year-old, a serving policeman at Barkingside Police Station in East London who was commended for his bravery during the London riots, claims he was repeatedly victimised for his sexual orientation. PC Lichters is suing the Met over claims of discrimination, harassment and victimisation. He told an employment tribunal he met Barrymore when he was out with friends and, following the entertainer’s arrest, he had offered him emotional support. He had informed his bosses about his friendship and claims rumours about him being involved in the death of Stuart Lubbock at Barrymore’s home were spread. PC Lichters, who joined the Met in 1999, told the tribunal in London: ‘Because of my sexual orientation, for years I have been harassed and discriminated against by officers and management on many occasions. PC Lichters became friends with Michael Barrymore, above, in 2001 following his arrest after a man’s body was found in his swimming pool . ‘In one incident, two PCs questioned me about Barrymore and asked me if I had sh***ed any other celebrities. I was very embarrassed and affected by the comment.’ In 2008, after he joined the dog unit, he said he suffered more abuse after his four-month-old police puppy Oscar was attacked during a walk by a pit bull. His version of how the dog received its injuries was questioned by senior officers. They began an investigation, which PC Lichters described as ‘disproportionate’. He said fellow officers spread ‘salacious rumours’ that he had invented the dog attack. He told the tribunal: ‘There were rumours, including I had been gay cruising on Hampstead Heath with my dog and, due to me neglecting it while having gay sex, it had been injured.’ The officer claimed he was also told: ‘We don’t want queers in the dog section.’ Louise Chudleigh, representing the Metropolitan Police, said the investigation had been necessary as the ‘puppy incident’ called into question his honesty and integrity. She told PC Lichters: ‘Anything that calls into question the integrity of a serving police officer should be looked into thoroughly.’ She put it to him that he had been treated the same as any other officer.

"Normal programming has resumed. After three days of great respect between Australia and India, traditional hostilities, which have marked recent matches between the two nations, have resumed on day four of the first cricket Test after David Warner reacted to being bowled by a no-ball from young paceman Varun Aaron. As the ball clattered into the stumps, Aaron celebrated by yelling out 'c'mon!' to his team-mates. But a review of the dismissal found he had over-stepped and the umpires called Warner back to the middle. The first innings centurion looked directly at the fast bowler and mouthed 'c'mon' on several occasions. Tempers flared, with non-striker Shane Watson also becoming involved as other Indian players chastised Warner for his reaction. The umpires were forced to intervene and asked them all to cool down. After three days of great respect between Australia and India, traditional hostilities which have marked recent matches between the two nations, have resumed on day four of the first cricket Test after David Warner reacted to being bowled by a no-ball from young paceman Varun Aaron . Shane Watson of Australia has words with the Indian players during day four of the First Test match between Australia and India at Adelaide Oval . Shikhar Dhawan of India exchanges words with Shane Watson of Australia during day four of the First Test match between Australia and India at Adelaide Oval . Tempers flared, with non-striker Shane Watson becoming involved as other Indian players chastised Warner for his reaction . Let's calm down says Virat Kohli to Shane Watson after the Australian batsman exchanged heated words with some of the Indian fielders on day four . Peacemaker. India captain Virat Kohli does his best to diffuse the situation between David Warner and Varun Aaron at the Adelaide Oval . 'C'mon'. David Warner has a mid-pitch discussion with Indian captain Virat Kohli after he was recalled on a no-ball dismissal by young paceman Varun Aaron . But Warner taunted the bowler again when he let the next ball pass through with another audible and sarcastic 'c'mon'. With the Test on the line, both sides have been giving their all. Australia scored more than 100 runs in the second session with Warner leading the way, as the home team pushed to post a competitive lead going into the last day on Saturday. Indian ire rose further when Warner appeared to be caught behind off Aaron immediately after the tea break, only for the appeal to be turned down. The in-their-face attitude was in stark contrast to Thursday's proceedings when Mitchell Johnson hit India's captain Virat Kohli on the helmet and the entire Australian side was visibly shaken. The first Test of the summer was delayed and moved to Adelaide, instead of Brisbane, because of the tragic death of Australian opener Phillip Hughes. This match has been dedicated to the late batsman, with a 63-second standing ovation featuring on day one along with the number 408 on both the Australians' shirts and on the ground. There have also been several touching tributes on the field of play but with a Test victory on the line, no quarter was asked nor given. Back on day one Varun Aaron put David Warner under pressure early in the innings with the first bouncer of the Test series . Virat Kohli hit on the helmet by Mitchell Johnson on day three which saw the entire Australian team rush in to check on the welfare of the Indian skipper . Mitchell Johnson was consoled by Australian captain Michael Clarke after striking his Indian counterpart with a short delivery. But the spirit of cricket has been tested on day four as both sides exchanged words in the middle . Earlier, off-spinner Nathan Lyon claimed his sixth five-wicket Test haul to bowl Australia into a handy lead. Lyon captured five for 134 off 36 overs to help dismiss the tourists for 444 and trail Australia by 73 runs in the first innings. India unravelled after resuming at 369 for five and lost five wickets for 75 on the fourth morning, with Lyon leading the way with his unpredictable turn out of the bowlers' footmarks. Lyon, coming off an underwhelming series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates where he captured three Test wickets at an average of 140, thanked India paceman Ishant Sharma for creating demons in the Adelaide Oval pitch. 'It's pretty easy, we had big Ishant running down the middle of the wicket (in Australia's first innings),' Lyon said after Thursday's third day's play. 'I'm thankful for him making some footmarks. Hopefully, he does it the whole series.'","The heat is on at Adelaide Oval with the Australian and Indian teams exchanging words in the middle of the ground .

"Questions have been raised over whether Theresa May met secretly with the Senate intelligence committee as it investigated CIA torture . Questions have been raised over whether Theresa May made a secret visit to a US committee probing CIA torture, amid claims the Government has been frantically 'lobbying' to keep Britain out of the damning report. Yesterday, The Mail published details of how the Home Secretary was among politicians and diplomats who held meetings with the Senate intelligence committee, while it was investigating the barbaric techniques inflicted on terror suspects. The information about the meeting - said to be one of 23 involving British diplomats over the past six years - was released under Freedom of Information laws by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. But last night, the Government issued an extraordinary clarification, stating it had made a 'clerical error' and that Mrs May had not met with the committee when it initially said she had. But, after the U-turn, officials admitted they could not confirm whether Mrs May may have met leading members on subsequent visits in later years. In a statement released today, the FCO said: ‘Due to a clerical error, which we very much regret, the FCO’s FOI response of 1 August on contacts with the US Senate select committee on intelligence referred to a meeting between the committee and the Home Secretary in July 2011. 'That was a mistake: her planned visit in July 2011 did not take place and was postponed until September 2011. 'On that reinstated visit in September 2011, she did not meet the committee.’ As revealed yesterday, William Hague, then foreign secretary, and spy agencies MI5 and MI6 were among a string of politicians and diplomats who held discussions with the committee about any redactions that might be needed to protect ‘national security’. In the end, there was not a single mention of any of the UK security and intelligence services when the explosive document was published on Tuesday. On Thursday, in a surprise development, Number Ten changed its story over the talks with the committee. Asked on Wednesday about requested redactions, David Cameron’s official spokesman said there had been ‘none whatsoever, to my knowledge’. But yesterday his deputy said: ‘My understanding is that no redactions were sought to remove any suggestion that there was UK involvement in any alleged torture or rendition. 'But I think there was a conversation with the agencies and their US counterparts on the executive summary. ‘Any redactions sought there would have been on national security grounds in the way we might have done with any other report.’ The rest of list released by the Foreign Office details how senior ministers and diplomats met members of the committee 23 times in six years – equivalent to once every three months. William Hague, then foreign secretary (left) and Lord West (right) were among those who attended meetings . This remarkable access will raise fresh questions about the influence successive British governments tried to exert to ensure the country was not tainted by the revelations. It has fuelled concerns that the UK pushed for key parts of the report referring to Diego Garcia, a British territory in the Indian Ocean leased to the US military, to be redacted. Ministers have admitted that the island was a stopover for extraordinary rendition flights – in which terror suspects were moved to secret prisons around the world to be tortured. Yet the summary of the heavily censored report, published this week, did not contain a single mention of UK involvement. Critics suspect topics for the talks included whether British involvement in or knowledge of US actions was mentioned. Lord West, then the Labour security minister, met senators in October 2009. And Sir Peter Westmacott, ambassador to the US, and his predecessor Sir Nigel Sheinwald curried favour with the committee on 22 occasions. They met its chairman Dianne Feinstein six times. A cluster of meetings came as the committee took crucial decisions on how much of the report should be made public. The UK has repeatedly denied complicity in the CIA’s torture of Islamist terror suspects. Notably, two senators met by the UK ambassadors denounced the report on Tuesday. Jim Risch and Marco Rubio both said it will put lives in danger. Significantly, the FOI answer admits the list of talks is ‘not exhaustive’ and does not include ‘brush-by meetings’. Donald Campbell, of human rights group Reprieve, said: ‘The huge number of meetings . . . suggests a determined lobbying effort. We know Britain was involved in the CIA’s rendition programme, so it seems reasonable to assume these meetings focused on keeping embarrassing information about the UK’s role secret. ‘The Government has serious questions to answer over whether it lobbied to keep its involvement in this shameful affair under wraps.’ Mrs May will face close questioning about any discussions she had with senators on Monday when she is due to appear before MPs on the Commons home affairs committee. The Home Office declined to comment last night.","William Hague and MI6 among those who attended 23 meetings in six years .
