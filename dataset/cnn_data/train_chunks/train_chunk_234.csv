"(CNN) -- A federal task force looking for ways to curb gun violence will have a set of recommendations by Tuesday, Vice President Joe Biden announced Thursday. Speaking during a week of meetings with disparate groups on various sides of the issue -- including some for and others against stricter gun controls -- Biden, who oversees the task force, said the recommendations to be given to President Barack Obama will serve as a beginning. ""This doesn't mean it is the end of the discussion, but the public wants us to act,"" he told reporters. A look at U.S. gun laws . Obama called for the task force after last month's massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 27 people were killed -- 20 of them elementary school children. Biden said he's been surprised by how many groups have encouraged universal background checks for all gun owners, including those who purchase through private sales. Some states have backlogs of thousands of felons who are never registered on lists aimed at helping prevent dangerous weapons from getting into their hands, he noted. CNN iReport: The gun control debate . The National Rifle Association said it was ""disappointed"" with a White House task force meeting Thursday, saying it expected mental health, the ""marketing of violence to our kids"" and school safety to be top topics. ""We were disappointed with how little this meeting had to do with keeping our children safe and how much it had to do with an agenda to attack the Second Amendment,"" the group said in a statement. ""While claiming that no policy proposals would be prejudged, this task force spent most of its time on proposed restrictions on lawful firearms owners -- honest, taxpaying, hardworking Americans."" The group indicated it will now concentrate its efforts through members of Congress. NRA President David Keene told CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer"" that little common ground was found. An exception was a possible agreement to place ""potentially violent"" mentally ill people on a national database of those not allowed to buy firearms, Keene said. Share your recommendations on Twitter . Biden called it a complicated issue, emphasizing that there is ""no singular solution to how we deal with"" mass shootings. Many stakeholders in the issue have met with members of the task force, Biden said, including medical and religious groups, educators and parents. Concerns about mental health may be ""one of the most important things that we've been focusing on,"" he said. Biden also noted that many firearm deaths in the United States are suicides. Referring to one of the most contentious issues -- whether to reinstate an assault weapons ban -- Biden said he has never heard so much support for ""the need to do something about high-capacity magazines."" Former Marines share dramatically different stances on gun violence . The task force also was meeting with members of the entertainment industry to discuss violence in movies and TV shows. Obama has spoken out about a culture that often ""glorifies guns and violence."" Dan Glickman, a former congressman and onetime head of the Motion Picture Association of America, rejects suggestions of links between films and real-life violence. ""I don't think the abundance of movies that are put out by the entertainment industry are that violent or cause violence,"" he told CNN on Thursday. Opinion: Three areas where Biden and NRA can find common ground . Also, Glickman said, ""Hollywood does a pretty good job of letting parents know through its ratings system what kind of movie is coming out -- whether there's violence or sexual conduct or other kinds of things."" Glickman was a U.S. representative from Kansas for nine terms but lost a re-election bid in 1994. He blames that loss partly on supporting an assault weapons ban. ""I would vote for it again and thought it was the right thing to do,"" he said Thursday. He called it ""a very politically sensitive issue,"" particularly among law-abiding gun owners who see it as a threat to their ownership of guns. Biden said Wednesday that while legislative action is needed to prevent mass shootings, Obama is also exploring executive orders. Keene, the NRA president, told CNN that ""some things you can do by executive orders, some things you can't do by executive orders. Some things you do by executive orders need money to be implemented, and that's up to Congress."" Wal-Mart, Dick's Sporting Goods and Bass Pro Shops were among 10 retailers who were to meet Thursday with Attorney General Eric Holder, who is part of the panel. Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, triggered controversy earlier in the week when it said its officials were unavailable to attend the meeting because of scheduling. The company soon reversed its decision, saying it had ""underestimated the expectation to attend."" The NRA has argued that it is committed to keeping people protected, but that a focus on stricter gun control is misguided. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre has called for all U.S. schools to have armed guards. Keene later told CNN the group supports schools choosing whether they want armed guards.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama's State of the Union address Tuesday night is likely to be the most important domestic speech that he gives during the rest of his presidency -- but not for the reasons commonly cited. Conventional wisdom holds that the address offers the president the biggest platform -- and audience -- he will have to lay out his agenda and priorities for the next four years. Environmentalists are eagerly awaiting his promises on regulation of existing coal-fired power plants, on the Keystone XL pipeline and on international climate negotiations. The anti-gun community wants to know if he will fight for an assault weapons ban. Latinos want to see how he will advance on immigration. And so on ... and on. These and other issues are significant and will feature heavily in post-address analysis. But at the end of the day, the transcendent issue -- at least for most Americans right now -- is whether the president will propel the economy forward by breaking the deadlock on the nation's fiscal mess. This State of the Union address is probably the last chance that Obama has to reignite serious negotiations over a ""grand bargain."" Absent some sort of breakthrough soon, we are heading toward a sequester (lots of automatic spending cuts in domestic and defense programs) in March. That will in turn set off new rounds of squabbling and the likelihood that for months if not years to come, the nation will careen from one mini-crisis to the next, failing to solve underlying problems. For Obama, economists from Paul Krugman to Larry Summers have argued for some time that jobs and growth would be best served by a two-stage process: new spending on infrastructure and the like in the near term (more stimulus) followed by iron-clad reductions in deficits over the long haul. Instead, Washington is inviting just the opposite: a round of spending cuts in the near followed by weak, inadequate reductions in deficits over the long haul. Both will be a drag on growth and jobs. Democrats argue that Republicans are to blame -- and clearly they deserve a great deal of criticism, especially for their obstructionism. But the day after the elections, Republican House Speaker John Boehner offered tax increases, a huge concession, and now it is the Democrats who seem less willing to make tough choices and strike a long-term bargain. Moreover, Obama is the only leader in Washington elected by all the people, and as president, he has prime responsibility for finding a path forward. What can he do in his State of the Union to achieve a breakthrough? Two suggestions: . First, he should make a forthright new offer to Republicans: In exchange for them calling off the sequester and agreeing to infrastructure investments, he will offer them a set of concrete steps he will support to bring Medicare and Social Security under control. In addition, he will name negotiators to work with Congress, starting this year, on tax and entitlement changes, and additional tax increases and spending cuts to put our house in order. Both sides will have to compromise further than they have so far on cherished commitments. Second, the president should commit to working with Republicans to create a new tone for their relationship. Instead of each side looking upon negotiations as ""I win; you lose,"" the goal must be to create a ""win-win."" It is not necessary that each side like the other, but it is necessary that each side puts country first. Are these two steps hopelessly idealistic? Probably. If anything, all signs point in exactly the opposite direction. On substance, the president continues to say he would like a grand bargain but mostly on his terms, and he has done virtually nothing to fight for it. Indeed, in his inaugural, he seemed to step back from overhauling entitlements, portraying himself as chief defender of Medicare and Social Security. As the sequester approaches, he has offered a tactical set of small-bore proposals, not a strategic plan that would break the deadlock. Down deep, has he decided that he doesn't really care whether we solve the deficit mess on his watch -- that he accepts the liberal notion that it's a problem for 2020, not now? One wonders. On tone, the president has pivoted even more. Instead of the conciliatory Obama of the first term, we have seen a hard-nosed pugilist who paints Republicans as wackos ready to hurt senior citizens and starve children to protect the rich. It was discouraging to read Monday's lead article in Politico in which correspondent Glenn Thrush, citing Democrats in the White House and on the Hill, reported that Obama in his State of the Union will offer the GOP not an olive branch but a cattle prod. One Obama aide close to the drafting process quoted Sun Tzu: ""Build your enemy a golden bridge on which to retreat."" This is a team that wants a win-win negotiation over the deficits? The suspicion deepens that the Obama folks have secretly adopted a strategy of making Republicans look so extreme that they will be driven from power in 2014 and the president can then govern as he chooses in his final two years in office. For the country's sake, one hopes this suspicion is wrong. The window for achieving a grand bargain has been closing rapidly and could slam shut Tuesday night. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen.","David Gergen: President Obama's State of the Union could be crucial for second term .
He says if Obama doesn't get GOP to the table, we could see high-stakes budget fight .
It would be a mistake for Democrats to think they can win by refusing to negotiate, he says .
He says Obama's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake ."
"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama challenged Congress to join him in taking on ""our generation's task"" to ignite the growth of a ""rising, thriving middle class,"" using the first State of the Union address of his second term to prod Republicans to compromise on the major challenges facing the nation. ""It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country -- the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, what you look like, or who you love,"" Obama said Tuesday night, sounding familiar themes from his re-election campaign last year. The president emphasized economic growth and job creation, and insisted that his proposals would not increase the nation's deficit, though the White House offered no price tag on his initiatives. He also made an emotional plea for Congress to hold votes on controversial proposals for tougher gun laws after the Newtown, Connecticut, shootings in December that killed 20 schoolchildren. At the same time, Obama called for legislators to work together for the good of the nation, saying Americans ""expect us to put the nation's interests before party."" ""They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can,"" he said. ""For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together, and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all."" 5 things we learned . It was his fourth State of the Union address and seventh speech to a joint sitting of Congress, and analysts considered it a crucial moment for setting the tone for the political dialogue after four years of partisan division and congressional dysfunction. In the Republican response, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida signaled little acceptance of what Obama proposed, repeating longstanding GOP criticism of what he described as job-killing, growth-snuffing bigger government. ""Presidents in both parties -- from John F. Kennedy to Ronald Reagan -- have known that our free enterprise economy is the source of our middle-class prosperity,"" said Rubio, a tea party favorite considered the a rising star in the Republican Party. ""But President Obama? He believes it's the cause of our problems."" According to Rubio, the president's solution ""to virtually every problem we face is for Washington to tax more, borrow more and spend more."" CNN Fact Check: Rubio says Obamacare needs a check up . With both sides sticking to deeply entrenched positions, the night of competing messages signaled continued partisan division and political showdowns in Washington over the federal budget and further steps to reduce the deficit and national debt. ""In many ways, what we heard tonight is the same old, same old argument,"" noted CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told CNN that Rubio helped himself as a Republican leader, while Jennifer Granholm, the former Democratic governor of Michigan, accused the Florida senator of missing an opportunity to appeal to the political center because he overstated GOP talking points. To CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, Rubio emerged as an attractive figure on the American political stage but was short on specifics. Opinion: Obama dares Congress to get the job done . ""I don't think they won the arguments tonight,"" Gergen said of Republicans. The government faces deep spending cuts mandated by a previous agreement between Obama and Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling, and Obama renewed his call on Tuesday night for a comprehensive deficit-reduction plan that includes new tax revenue coupled with spending cuts. Taking aim at the bitter partisanship of his first term, Obama said ""let's set party interests aside, and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future."" ""And let's do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors,"" he continued to applause, mainly from Democrats. ""The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next. We can't do it. Let's agree, right here, right now, to keep the people's government open, and pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America."" In a jab at congressional Republicans who seek to shrink deficits and the size of government through deep spending cuts, saying ""deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan."" Rubio's response blamed Obama for weakening U.S. stability and potential by continued deficit spending and failing to take on needed reforms to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. ""The real cause of our debt is that our government has been spending $1 trillion more than it takes in every year. That's why we need a balanced budget amendment,"" he said, accusing Obama of wanting to leave Medicare unchanged so that it goes bankrupt. Opinion: In 2013, democracy talks back about State of the Union . However, Obama called for ""modest"" reforms to Medicare in his speech, repeating proposals already raised in previous deficit-reduction negotiations that Republicans consider insufficient. After arriving to loud cheers and prolonged applause on a night of political pomp and ceremony, Obama began the speech on a positive note, saying the nation was on sound footing to move forward. ""Together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger,"" he said. The president continued his push for Congress to act on politically volatile issues such as immigration reform. Other measures in the speech included a paycheck fairness act intended to make it easier for women to fight salary discrimination without losing their jobs, and new proposals to develop alternative energy hubs in the country, and help people refinance their mortgages at today's lower interest rates. Headlines of the day also influenced the speech. CNN Fact Check: Illegal border crossings at lowest levels in 40 years . Obama mentioned North Korea's latest underground nuclear test, which the State Department labeled ""provocative"" and ""extremely regrettable."" With victims of gun violence in the audience at the Capitol, including former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, Obama continued his push for tighter gun laws opposed by the influential National Rifle Association and legislators from both parties. He mentioned 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, the Chicago girl killed by gun violence after returning home from taking part in inauguration activities in Washington, saying she was shot a mile from his home in the city. The girl's parents were guests of first lady Michelle Obama at the address. Also attending was former rock star Ted Nugent, a vocal critic of Obama and any efforts to strengthen gun controls in America. Obama cited the major provisions of his package of gun proposals, including background checks on all gun sales, a ban on semi-automatic weapons that mimic military weapons, and limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds. Listing gun violence victims -- Hadiya's parents, Giffords, the families of the Newtown schoolchildren and others killed in mass shootings, Obama said ""they deserve a vote"" as the audience cheered loudly. In his response, Rubio sounded the NRA line that ""unconstitutionally undermining the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans is not the way to"" reduce gun violence in the country. On foreign policy, Obama announced that this time next year, another 34,000 U.S. troops will have returned home from Afghanistan. The move will reduce by more than half the current force level of 66,000 troops in Afghanistan. Obama and NATO previously announced that Afghan forces will take the lead in combat missions this year. By the end of 2014, the planned official end of the combat mission, the White House is considering a range of troop levels for Afghanistan, from as many as 15,000 down to zero. One thing Obama didn't mention Tuesday night was new regulations on carbon emissions for existing power plants a senior administration official said. Environmentalists hoped the president's pledge in his recent inaugural address for increased steps in response to climate change would include expanding tougher standards in place for new power plants to those already in existence. CNN Fact Check: Wind energy breezes into the record books . At the same time, the president promised executive action on climate change if Congress fails to address what he called a litany of evidence that the nation and the world face increasing impacts such as more frequent and powerful storms, wildfires and drought. One new measure from the president will be an executive order signed Tuesday to address the country's most basic cybersecurity needs. The order will make it easier for private companies in control of our nation's critical infrastructure to share information about cyber attacks with the government. In return, the Department of Homeland Security will share ""sanitized"" classified information with companies about attacks believed to be occurring or that are about to take place. Congress has failed so far to pass any of the dozens of cybersecurity bills aimed at meaningfully securing critical infrastructure from an online criminals. CNN Fact Check: Obama on fuel economy -- your mileage may vary . Rubio is a tea party favorite being promoted as the new face of the Republican Party due to his Hispanic heritage and strong communications skills. Obama won overwhelming support from the Latino vote in defeating GOP challenger Mitt Romney in the November election. Rubio is leading an effort by some Republicans to shift party policy on immigration reform by accepting the concept backed by Obama and Democrats that the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants should have a path to legal status. However, he neglected to mention specifics of an immigration reform plan in his response Tuesday night. When Obama raised the immigration issue in his speech, a bipartisan group of senators, including Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York, stood and applauded together to signal bipartisan support for moving forward. In addition to Rubio, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky offered a second Republican response that reflected the concerns of tea party conservatives who support him. Paul criticized Obama and Congress for failing to seriously address the federal deficit and national debt. CNN's Jim Acosta, Kevin Liptak, Rachel Streitfeld, Ashley Killough and Mark Preston contributed to this report.","NEW: Sen. Marco Rubio reiterates his party's criticism of Obama in the GOP response .

"(CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI's resignation captured the world's attention, and rightly. It is the first papal resignation in nearly six centuries. The pope leads a church that includes a sixth of the world's population. His gravitas reverberates outside Roman Catholicism: The pope talks and people listen. Others are fascinated by Vatican spectacle. Benedict speaks Latin and wears gold vestments. His successor's election by conclave, with sequestering and smoke, is high drama. But for all the excitement and ceremony, the pope is not the most important thing about Catholicism. For all his influence, the pope makes up an infinitesimal fraction of the opinions and activities of Catholics. The most important thing about Catholicism is the 1 billion who claim it as their faith. In the wake of updating by the Second Vatican Council, Roman bishops emphasized the role of the laity. Lay activism exploded. Many Catholic theologians stressed the whole community of Catholics working together. Opinion: Why pope will be remembered for generations . The issue is not only what the Church should look like. We should be concerned about media and popular takes on what Catholicism does look like. News coverage of the Church is usually about the hierarchy. Ask average Americans about Catholicism and they likely will mention the pope. This happened for several reasons. No other big religious institution is so centralized. The media covers the pope as Catholicism because it is easy to cover the pope as Catholicism. Place a correspondent in Rome or even just use Vatican press releases. There is no highest authority of Hinduism. There is no international imam of Islam. Also, despite the Vatican II council of the 1960s, popes kept expanding their authority. Benedict XVI endorsed that council but read tradition to support papal sovereignty. If popular opinion overwhelmingly associates Catholicism with the papacy, that's partly because effective Vatican theologizing made it so. Roland Martin: Pope shows true leadership by resigning . Finally, the U.S. has always had an obsession with the pope. Ironically, this obsession had roots in anti-Catholicism. Americans ""used"" the pope as a way to sharpen national identity. American democracy was contrasted with papal demagoguery, American piety with papal superstition, American modernity with papal obsolescence. U.S. Roman Catholics felt pulled between nation and church. Scholars have noted that American faithful were more pope-identified than coreligionists around the world, as if overcompensating to hold the two sides together. But obsession involves both attraction and loathing. Even ardent anti-Catholics seemed consumed with fascination for the pontiff. The infamous publisher of anti-Catholic comics, Jack Chick depicts decadent popes lofting ominous speech bubbles, precisely capitalizing on the fact that such scenes make gripping graphic art. It's as if the pope â€” with absolute rule, a throne, pomp and circumstance â€” taps into a repressed fantasy of crowns and ermine. Perhaps pop god Prince put it best: . So U can be the President . I'd rather be the Pope . Yeah, U can be the side effect . I'd rather be the dope . Arguably Prince is right; the pope is bigger than the president. But the pope is not the dope. At least not for purposes of best analyzing Catholicism. While the popes have attempted to maintain the status quo from the top down, three major phenomena are happening in the Church from the ground up -- and the media would be well advised to pay attention. First, vernacular religion. This refers to religion as it is actually lived, rather than how leaders say it should be lived. A term coined by Leonard Primiano of Cabrini College, vernacular religion highlights that while clerics write creeds and command pulpits, official religion is the tip of the iceberg of religious culture. Opinion: Why next pope must open up church and usher in Vatican III . This became visible in coverage of bishops' activism against President Obama's health care law provisions for artificial birth control. The bishops held the official position that artificial birth control was morally wrong. Most news accounts added that a majority of U.S. Catholic women used it anyway. This addition was a start, but it needs to go further. According to doctrine, women were ""going against"" their Church. But in terms of vernacular religion, their everyday Catholicism was simply different from the approved version. Second, other Catholics. Last year a Religion Dispatches blog headline read, ""Will the Catholic Church Split?"" As several noted in the comments, Catholicism has already split. Catholicism is actually not one structurally unified body â€” and hasn't been since 1054. The Orthodox churches are Catholic, the biggest headed by the Patriarch of Constantinople. The Anglican Communion (including the U.S. Episcopal Church) identifies as both Catholic and Protestant, headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Old Catholic churches of Europe formed in the late 19th century as harbor for Catholics who rejected papal infallibility; they are in communion with Anglicanism. In the United States at least 200 separate small Catholic churches and clergy associations exist, often with their own bishops. Some are CORPUS, a corps of married priests who celebrate the sacraments; Roman Catholic Womenpriests, who like many others are ordaining women; and the Ecumenical Catholic Communion, which has partnered with the other two groups. Third, flows. Some people live in several Catholic worlds. In the United States, a Catholic woman might attend a Roman parish, work for Catholic Charities, serve as an independent Catholic priest, officiate weddings for divorced Romans on weekends and do Buddhist meditation every morning, too. What would it mean to account for vernacular Catholicism? Non-Roman Catholics? Flows between Rome and other institutions? Understanding one of the world's most populous faiths needs to encompass all of Catholicism -- not just the Roman version. And certainly not just the pope. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julie Byrne.","Julie Byrne: Pope Benedict XVI's resignation rightly drew enormous world attention .
She says often media focus on the pope as entirety of Catholic Church .
While pope commands attention, lay groups have become increasingly important, she says .
Byrne: Church is split over many issues; Vatican doctrine is only part of the story ."
"Rome (CNN) -- Thousands of Catholics waving flags from around the world packed St. Peter's Square on Sunday to hear Pope Francis deliver his inaugural Angelus. The new pontiff gave his Angelus, or noon blessing, from the papal apartment window, speaking to more than 200,000 worshippers in the square four days after his election as pope. ""Dear brothers and sisters, good morning,"" he said in Italian, drawing cheers from the crowd. During the 15-minute address, he focused on forgiveness. ""Never forget this: The Lord never tires of forgiving us,"" he said. ""Have you thought about the patience that God has with each of us?"" He made the historic address after celebrating Mass at Sant'Anna parish in Vatican City earlier Sunday. In a rare move for a pope, Francis spontaneously walked out from Vatican territory to greet cheering well-wishers outside Sant'Anna Gate. ""Francesco, Francesco!"" the crowd chanted. Also on Sunday, the pope sent out his first message from the papal Twitter account: ""Dear friends, I thank you from my heart and I ask you to continue to pray for me. Pope Francis."" In his first week as pontiff, Francis has enjoyed global fanfare as the first Latin American pope and the first Jesuit pope in modern times. The official Mass to inaugurate Francis as the bishop of Rome -- and leader of the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics -- will take place Tuesday. A church 'for the poor' The new pope explained his choice of the name Francis in a meeting with journalists Saturday and discussed how he wished for a church that was both poor and ""for the poor."" Francis, who before he became pope was Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, said a fellow cardinal from Brazil had told him ""Don't forget the poor"" as the votes stacked up in his favor. ""Right away, with regard to the poor, I thought of St. Francis of Assisi, then I thought of war,"" he told the assembled journalists. ""Francis loved peace and that is how the name came to me."" He had also thought of St. Francis of Assisi's concern for the natural environment, he said, and how he was a ""poor man, a simple man, as we would like a poor church, for the poor."" St. Francis of Assisi, who gave up his own wealth and prestige, is revered among Catholics for his work with the poor. Pope Francis a pontiff of firsts . A blessing for all . The new pope concluded the meeting with press -- which did not include questions -- with a blessing for all the journalists present and their families. Francis acknowledged that not all those present were Catholic, saying he gave them his blessing ""knowing that you are of different religions, because all of you are children of God."" 5 things to know about the new pope . As a cardinal in Buenos Aires, he developed close relations with Argentina's Jewish community. He wrote to the chief rabbi in Rome last week, saying he strongly hoped to ""contribute to the progress of the relations that have existed between Jews and Catholics"" since the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, which redrew the church's relations with the modern world, ""in a spirit of renewed collaboration."" Catholics: 5 ways for Francis to move forward . Reforms to come? In just his first few days as pope, Francis has prompted speculation that he may bring in wider changes. While he decided the heads of the various Vatican offices will keep their jobs for now, he's not making any definitive appointments, the Vatican said Saturday. CNN Vatican analyst John Allen, who's also a correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, said this is the first clear signal that he may be serious about reform. ""It's customary for new popes to swiftly reconfirm the department heads who lose their positions when the previous pontificate ends, and then take his time about bringing in his team,"" Allen said. ""The fact that Francis has not followed that path may suggest that significant personnel moves will come sooner rather than later."" Francis wants ""a certain period for reflection, prayer and dialogue before (making) any definitive nomination or confirmation,"" the Vatican statement said. Questions about the past . The Vatican has sought to quell controversy over Francis' conduct during Argentina's so-called Dirty War, amid accusations that he could have done more to protect two Jesuit priests who were kidnapped. In a news conference Friday, the Vatican rejected the allegations as defamatory and untrue. ""This was never a concrete or credible accusation in his regard. He was questioned by an Argentinian court as someone aware of the situation but never as a defendant. He has, in documented form, denied any accusations,"" said the Rev. Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman. ""Instead, there have been many declarations demonstrating how much Bergoglio did to protect many persons at the time of the military dictatorship,"" he said. A meeting on the pope's agenda Monday may be another sign that he's trying to put the past behind him. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is scheduled to meet with Francis Monday afternoon. As archbishop of Buenos Aires in 2010, Francis sharply criticized her government's push to legalize gay marriage, calling proposed legislation ""a destructive attack on God's plan."" With a front-page counterpunch, the president said the church possessed ""attitudes reminiscent of medieval times and the Inquisition."" Some analysts thought Fernandez's lukewarm praise of Francis after he was elected to the papacy Wednesday signaled that old tensions were still simmering. But on Sunday, Argentina's state-run Telam news agency trumpeted Fernandez's arrival in Rome and said she would be the first head of state to meet with the Francis in his new role. Meeting with Benedict XVI . Francis will meet with his predecessor, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, on Saturday, the Vatican said. The meeting will take place at the papal summer residence, Castel Gandolfo, where Benedict has been staying since his historic resignation. It comes amid concern in some quarters that the presence of a living former pope might lead to a conflict of interests or influence. The Vatican has said that Benedict will not seek to interfere in the running of the church, but will focus on study and prayer. Hada Messia reported from Rome, and Holly Yan wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark, Karen Smith, Catherine E. Shoichet and Mariano Castillo also contributed to this report.","In his inaugural Angelus, the pope focuses on forgiveness .

"(CNN) -- Despite supporters' hopes that this time it's different, President Barack Obama's new call for restricting some semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines will face deeply entrenched resistance in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and could be a long shot even in the Democratic-led Senate. Any gun legislation sent to the House ""is going to have to pass with most Democrats and a few Republicans,"" said Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the Rothenberg Political Report. ""This would be an even more high-profile bill."" Read the proposals . And Obama's call for Congress to reinstate the federal ban on military-style rifles that expired in 2004 ""is a further reach than some of the other proposals that are being tossed around,"" Gonzales said. ""There is no way that it is going to pass with a majority of Republican support,"" he said. ""That is just the reality of the situation. It is going to take virtually all the Democrats, and all the Democrats won't vote for that."" Obama and Vice President Joe Biden laid out a package of measures aimed at reducing gun violence Wednesday, just over a month after the December massacre at a Connecticut elementary school. The killings of 26 people there followed a July rampage in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, that left 12 dead and the August attack on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin that killed another six. ""The world has changed, and it's demanding action,"" said Biden, who led a White House task force on gun violence after the Connecticut slayings. But before the announcement, local officials in at least three states vowed to resist any new gun controls. And Second Amendment fans have poured out their vituperation online, some floridly warning of a power grab by the Obama administration. A look at U.S. gun laws . Texas state Rep. Steve Toth told CNN on Wednesday that he'll introduce legislation that would make it illegal to enforce a federal gun ban. ""We're going to do everything we can to call people back to the belief and the understanding that we're a constitutional republic and that our rights do not come from Congress,"" he said. ""Our rights come from God and are enumerated in the Constitution."" And in a video that spread virally across the Internet, the head of a Tennessee gun training and accessory company warned ""all you patriots"" to ""get ready to fight"" if the Obama administration took steps to restrict firearms. ""I am not letting my country be ruled by a dictator. I'm not letting anybody take my guns. If it goes one inch further, I'm gonna start killing people,"" Tactical Response CEO James Yeager vowed. In a later video, in which he's accompanied by his attorney, Yeager apologized ""for letting my anger get the better of me"" and cautioned viewers, ""It's not time for any type of violent action."" Opinion: NRA's paranoid fantasy . Obama on Wednesday signed 23 orders that don't require congressional approval that he said would stiffen background checks on gun buyers and expand safety programs in schools. And he called on Congress to restrict ammunition magazines to no more than 10 rounds and to require a background check for anyone buying a gun, whether at a store or in a private sale or gun show. The steps that require legislative action are likely to bump up against the often-visceral opposition of lawmakers from conservative districts -- and some of their more outspoken constituents. Most Republicans in the House of Representatives have top rankings from the National Rifle Association, the powerful gun-rights lobby, which quickly criticized the White House plans. But it's not just Republicans: Many Democrats, particularly in the conservative South and rural West, are vocal gun-rights supporters as well. ""Guns have been one of the key issues that more moderate Democrats have used to express their independence from the Democratic Party, and this gun talk is putting a strain on that independence,"" Gonzales said. Though they might be willing to support proposals such as a ban on large-capacity magazines, they're unlikely to vote to ban ""an actual gun,"" he said. CNN/Time Poll: Slight dip in support for gun control measures in last month . ""You can just see the ads -- 'They are taking guns away' -- where with these other items it is different,"" Gonzales said. Even in the Senate, where Democrats control the chamber, Democratic leadership sources told CNN that passing any new legislation will be extremely difficult. More than a dozen vulnerable Democrats from conservative states will likely resist much of what the president is pushing, the sources said. Those sources say they have no intention of putting their members in politically vulnerable position on a gun measure unless they are sure it can reach the president's desk. That means not only getting enough red-state Democrats on board, but getting enough Republicans to break a possible GOP filibuster. But Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-New York, said the tide appears to have shifted in favor of gun control after the Connecticut killings. A CNN/Time magazine/ORC International poll released Wednesday found 55% of Americans generally favor stricter gun control laws, with 56% saying that it's currently too easy to buy guns in this country -- but only 39% say that stricter gun controls would reduce gun violence all by themselves. McCarthy said Senate approval ""might even give some members of Congress the spine to do the right thing."" ""You know, the NRA is not in line with an awful lot of their members, and that is something we're counting on to go forward,"" said McCarthy, whose husband was among the six killed when a deranged gunman opened fire on a Long Island commuter train in 1993 . December's killings have ""gone to the heart of every mother, father, grandparent thinking about their children, grandchildren. We have to do something,"" she added.

"Washington (CNN) -- Shortly after his $447 billion jobs plan stalled Tuesday in the Senate, President Barack Obama vowed to break the broad initiative down into numerous, separate bills -- potentially setting up even more showdowns between Democrats and Republicans on how to boost the economy and where to get the money to do so. The Democrat-pushed bill failed Tuesday night to get the 60 votes needed in the Senate to proceed. A total of 50 members of the chamber supported the measure, while 49 cast ballots against it. In a statement issued Tuesday night, Obama said that despite being an obvious defeat, ""tonight's vote is by no means the end of this fight."" He then outlined his intention to work with Senate Majority Harry Reid and produce several smaller bills derived from the bigger plan. ""In the coming days, members of Congress will have to take a stand on whether they believe we should put teachers, construction workers, police officers and firefighters back on the job,"" Obama said in a statement released Tuesday night. ""They'll get a vote on whether they believe we should protect tax breaks for small business owners and middle-class Americans, or whether we should protect tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires."" The latter issue -- and, more generally, how best to pay for any jobs initiatives -- has been the most contentious in the debate, and the main reason the bill failed to go anywhere in the Senate. Specifically, Republicans vehemently oppose a recently added provision that would fund the measure through a 5.6% surtax on annual incomes over $1 million. GOP leaders have accused the president of engaging in so-called ""class warfare"" for political reasons, while Democrats have called the proposal fair and accused their opponents of taking the side of the rich over the vast majority of Americans. As he has repeatedly in recent weeks, Obama again pressed for Congress on Tuesday night to ""meet their responsibility, put their party politics aside and take action on jobs right now."" With the legislation to be broken down in several pieces, he said that legislators will now be forced to answer to their constituents ""with each vote."" While the vast majority of Senate Democrats voted in favor of the president's job plan, a few -- including Ben Nelson of Nebraska and John Tester of Montana -- did not. Tester said, in a prepared statement, that ""the things I support in this bill are outweighed by the things I can't support,"" including ""sending billions of dollars in bailout aid to states."" The Senate version of the measure has little chance of clearing the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Administration officials had indicated earlier that they were prepared to try to pass the president's plan in smaller parts, if necessary. But it is unclear what -- if anything -- a sharply polarized Congress is capable of passing as the election year nears. GOP leaders dismissed the president's plea, and characterized the plan as little more than a political stunt. ""This whole exercise ... is a charade,"" declared Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. ""Democrats have designed this bill to fail. They've designed their own bill to fail in the hopes that anyone who votes against it will look bad for opposing a bill they misleadingly refer to as a 'jobs bill.'"" ""What matters most to the Democrats ... is that they have an issue to run on next year,"" McConnell insisted. Among other things, the package includes an extension and expansion of the current payroll tax cut, an extension of jobless benefits to help the unemployed, new tax credits for businesses that hire the long-term unemployed, and additional money to help save and create jobs for teachers and first responders such as firefighters. But it is the proposed surtax on people earning over $1 million that has emerged as perhaps the most contentious dividing line between the two parties. The provision was added by key Senate Democrats to make Obama's bill more acceptable to his own party. Republicans insist the measure would be devastating to small companies. ""Four out of five of these so-called millionaires are small businesses"" employing over 300,000 people, McConnell claimed last week in an interview on Fox Business Network. ""Raising taxes in the middle of an economic slowdown is a bad idea."" In a speech Tuesday afternoon to a union crowd in Pittsburgh, Obama said that addressing revenue streams is necessary. ""In a perfect world with unlimited resources nobody would have to pay any taxes,"" he said. ""But that's not the world we live in. We live in a world where we have to make choices."" Asked last week if he is laying the groundwork to run against a ""do-nothing Congress"" -- a reprise of President Harry Truman's 1948 campaign -- Obama told reporters: ""If Congress does something, then I can't run against a do-nothing Congress."" But ""if Congress does nothing,"" he added, ""I think the American people will run them out of town."" With the economy remaining shaky and unemployment hovering above 9%, the economy is virtually certain to be the dominant issue of next year's presidential campaign. Obama has touted his new plan in a series of campaign-style speeches across the country over the past couple of weeks. ""Instead of trying to get compromise, (Obama's) embracing conflict,"" House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" The president is ""running around the country campaigning on a bill that he knows won't pass -- he can't even get it out of the Senate right now -- rather than working with us on ideas that we agree on that would actually help create jobs."" ""We want to go with ideas that work,"" Ryan declared. The largest measure in the package is the expanded payroll tax cut, which comes at a projected cost of $265 billion. Employees normally pay 6.2% on their first $106,800 of wages into Social Security, but they are now paying only 4.2%. That break is set to expire at the end of December, and Obama wants to cut the tax in half to 3.1%. Republicans previously embraced the cut, but have increasingly questioned its economic merit. A second key measure -- estimated to cost roughly $44 billion -- is the extension of emergency jobless benefits to help the long-term unemployed. Lawmakers first expanded benefits to cover 99 weeks in 2009, and have since reauthorized the expansion five times. McConnell has also blasted the bill as a whole, calling it a rehash of Obama's 2009 economic stimulus plan. Democrats insist that measure helped prevent a more serious economic meltdown, while top Republicans have characterized it as a failure that did little beyond adding to the federal government's skyrocketing debt. ""It reminds me of an old country saying at home that there's no education in the second kick of a mule,"" McConnell told Fox. ""Our view is we've been there, we've done that, we know that doesn't work and we shouldn't do it again."" The 2009 measure ""was a success in terms of job creation,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, insisted later in the week. ""It wasn't fully appreciated, but the fact is that it made a big difference."" The new proposal ""is a much smaller package"" but would be ""a good start"" in terms of job creation, she added. CNN's Ted Barrett, Jeanne Sahadi and Martina Stewart contributed to this report.","NEW: 50 senators voted for the bill, 49 against -- below the threshold for it to proceed .

"Washington (CNN) -- As with any State of the Union address, President Barack Obama this year had several audiences and there were multiple aims for the White House: To show that he understands the economy is still struggling and that he will do more to help the unemployed find jobs, and to portray a different side of himself than what was seen on Inauguration Day -- one willing to reach out to the other party. While the president did offer some new proposals -- including increasing the minimum wage and guaranteeing preschool -- many of the ideas he pushed were repeating what he had previously offered but went nowhere in divided Washington. And we saw a president trying to expand the use of executive power to help push his agenda. State of the Union brings out more of the 'same old, same old' Here are five things we learned Tuesday night: . 1. It's still the economy, stupid . It very well could have been a campaign speech given last year -- the president talking about the need for a balanced approach to deficit reduction, at least four references to protecting the middle class, the need to reignite ""the true engine of America's economic growth."" With the recovery still weak, unemployment at 7.9% and the nation's growth rate shrinking the last three months of 2012, the president and his team know much of his legacy may be dependent on helping reignite the economy. The president pushed for 15 manufacturing hubs to help spur high tech job growth. With $85 billion in automatic across-the-board spending cuts set to take effect on March 1, Obama pushed for a replacement of them because some economists warn they could lead to a recession. However, he did not give any ground on what he would accept as an alternative -- setting up the next major fiscal fight with Republicans. 53% of those watching speech give Obama thumbs up . 2. Mr. Bipartisan? Facing hundreds of members of the opposing party, Obama took a decidedly different approach than he did in his aggressive inaugural address. ""They do expect us to put the nation's interests before party. They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can. For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all,"" the president said early on in the address. He even praised some Republicans -- he pointed to how Sen. John McCain, his 2008 opponent, worked with then-Sen. Joe Lieberman, a Democrat turned Independent, on climate change. He mentioned his 2012 opponent, Mitt Romney, and said we should try his idea of tying the minimum wage to the cost of living. GOP's Rubio rips Obama, says his plans will hurt middle class . While he talked about how chances are good for bipartisan approaches on tax and immigration reform, Republicans can be expected to say they haven't seen a different approach so far from the president on many key issues: He wants more tax revenues and more government spending on his priorities, which are non-starters among Republicans. Fifty-three percent of those surveyed in a CNN/ORC instant poll of speech-watchers said they did not believe the address would lead to bipartisan cooperation while 39% said they thought it would. Obama hearts Romney in State of the Union . 3. Show me the money . Proposals he floated would make high-quality preschool available to every child, provide tax credits for businesses to hire and invest, promote more scientific research and development, further shift cars and trucks away from gasoline, and invest in infrastructure. ""Nothing I'm proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime."" he said. ""It's not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth."" But White House officials refuse to put a price tag on the programs -- or to reveal how, in fact, they would be paid for. They promised more details when the White House's budget proposal is released in a few weeks. CNN Fact Check: Obama on fuel economy -- Your mileage may vary . 4. If they won't, I will . The president demonstrated clearly how he plans to aggressively use executive actions to push policy if Congress thwarts him and he announced action on climate change and cybersecurity. ""If Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will,"" he said. ""I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy."" After efforts dealing with cybersecurity failed to pass Congress, the president signed an executive order to increase information-sharing and to help the private sector develop standards. These moves came after the president last month approved 23 executive actions dealing with gun control. Obama also used the speech to make his base happy by emphasizing such liberal priorities as climate change and equal treatment and benefits for gay Americans as well as announcing a bipartisan commission to improve the voting system and pushing for a hike in the minimum wage. CNNMoney: The impact of a $9 minimum wage . 5. Even presidents can't control the news . While the White House tried to build up suspense around what the president would say, as soon as news broke Tuesday afternoon that accused cop-killer Christopher Dorner was believed to be holed up in a cabin in the California mountains, much of the media immediately switched gears. What would have been hours of coverage of what was expected from the speech, what Obama's message might be and discussion of his agenda did not happen. Would this be another split-screen State of the Union similar to when networks flashed news of the verdict in O.J. Simpson's civil trial during Bill Clinton's 1997 address? That did not happen this time but as soon as Obama wrapped up most news organizations quickly updated viewers on the Dorner story. But the president might have gotten an unintended benefit from the other story of the day -- interest in Dorner might have helped boost the audience for the address.

"Washington (CNN) -- Here is a roundup of the main themes President Barack Obama touched on during Tuesday's State of the Union address: . Immigration . Where he stands: Obama praised his administration's efforts at increasing border security by ""putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history,"" but recognized that there is still work to be done. He specifically addressed creating a path for illegal immigrants to obtain citizenship and fixing the legal immigration system by cutting waiting periods and reducing bureaucracy. What he said: ""Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I will sign it right away."" CNN Fact Check: Illegal border crossings at lowest levels in 40 years . Gun Control . Where he stands: ""They deserve a vote."" Obama's words about the victims of gun violence echoed in the House Chamber, summing up the president's stance on gun control. Obama called for a congressional vote on a series of gun control measures, including background checks in all gun sales and the prevention of anyone buying guns for resale to criminals. Obama's emotional plea might lead to vote on guns . What he said: ""Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals. Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets, because these police chiefs, they're tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned. Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress."" ""They deserve -- they deserve a simple vote."" 5 things we learned from the State of the Union . Climate change . Where he stands: Obama recognized the extreme shifts in climate over the past 15 years and advocated a transition to more sustainable and environment-friendly sources of energy, such as wind and solar, in order to reduce America's dependence on oil. Obama also proposed the creation of an Energy Security Trust dedicated to shifting our cars and trucks off oil. What he said: ""We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science and act before it's too late."" ""I urge this Congress to pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago. But if Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will."" CNN Fact Check: Wind energy breezes into the record books . Minimum Wage . Where he stands: What is one thing Obama and Mitt Romney agreed on last year? Minimum wage. Obama recommended raising the federal wage to $9 an hour to help working families. What he said: ""Here's an idea that Gov. Romney and I actually agreed on last year. Let's tie the minimum wage to the cost of living, so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on."" ""We know our economy's stronger when we reward an honest day's work with honest wages. But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $14,500 a year. Even with the tax relief we've put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line. That's wrong."" CNNMoney.com: The impact of $9 minimum wage . Troop withdrawal . Where he stands: Obama announced that 34,000 American troops will be withdrawn from Afghanistan by next February and promised the war in Afghanistan will be over by the end of 2014. What he said: ""Beyond 2014, America's commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will endure, but the nature of our commitment will change. We are negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses on two missions: training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos, and counterterrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of al Qaeda and their affiliates."" Opinion: Address gave foreign policy short shrift . Debt & Deficit . Where he stands: Obama's plan to reduce the national debt focuses on how to avoid the sequester and continue to reduce deficits without cutting education and job training, while asking the wealthiest Americans to pay more. Obama argued that over the last few years, ""both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion -- mostly through spending cuts"" and that the government is ""halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction."" What he said: ""To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested, and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and well-connected. ... Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit."" GOP's Rubio rips Obama, says his plans will hurt middle class . Medicare . Where he stands: Obama took a firm stance against cutting funds for Medicare -- one of the federal government's largest line items -- while acknowledging its contribution to the nation's debt. Obama advocated the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles plan and offered to reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies. What he said: ""Yes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population. And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms -- otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations. But we can't ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and most powerful."" ""We'll bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldn't be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital. They should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive."" State of the Union, Twitter-style . Roads and Bridges . Where he stands: In an effort to create more jobs in the United States and improve the nation's infrastructure, Obama proposed a ""Fix-It First"" program, to put people to work on nearly 70,000 failing bridges, as well as roads. What he said: ""Ask any CEO where they'd rather locate and hire: a country with deteriorating roads and bridges, or one with high-speed rail and Internet, high-tech schools and self-healing power grids. The CEO of Siemens America -- a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina -- has said that if we upgrade our infrastructure, they'll bring even more jobs. And I know that you want these job-creating projects in your districts."" Obama keeps pressure on Republicans with jobs plan . Universal Preschool . Where he stands: Obama advocated for widespread enrollment in preschool, praising states like Georgia and Oklahoma that make it a priority. Enrollment in preschool, Obama says, means students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level, graduate high school, hold a job, and form more stable families of their own. What he said: ""I propose working with states to make high-quality preschool available to every child in America. Every dollar we invest in high-quality early education can save more than $7 later on -- by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime. ... So let's do what works, and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind. Let's give our kids that chance."" 5 education ideas from the State of the Union . Congress . Where he stands: Obama had a lot of demands for Congress on Tuesday night. He asked Congress to vote on just about every issue and called for lawmakers to work together to be more effective by successfully solving problems regardless of party divisions. What he said: ""The American people don't expect government to solve every problem. They don't expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue. But they do expect us to put the nation's interests before party."" Obama dares Congress to get the job done . Foreign policy and America's future . Where he stands: Obama's plan for America's future focuses on maintaining the nation's image as a role model for freedom in the world while reducing waste and wartime spending. What he said: ""In defense of freedom, we'll remain the anchor of strong alliances, from the Americas to Africa, from Europe to Asia. In the Middle East, we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights, and support stable transitions to democracy."" ""But as Americans, we all share the same proud title: We are citizens. It's a word that doesn't just describe our nationality or legal status. It describes the way we're made. It describes what we believe. It captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations; that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others; and that well into our third century as a nation, it remains the task of us all, as citizens of these United States, to be the authors of the next great chapter in our American story.""

"(CNN) -- Whenever a hugely popular and successful company goes public, many people wonder what will happen to all the newly created millionaires. What will they do now that they are financially ""set for life""? Will there be ""1,000 millionaires""? Will they suffer ""sudden wealth syndrome""? As Facebook begins the public portion of its initial public offering process, curiosity has reached a fever pitch. In truth, it's a bit ridiculous to speculate on the fortunes of Facebook employees. They are just like any other group of employees -- wildly diverse in their actions, thoughts, interests, desires, obligations and behaviors. In other words, they will behave like individuals. Sure, there will be luxury purchases. Some will buy stunning homes and others will buy fancy cars. There will be those who squirrel the money away for later use or invest in long-term projects. If history is any guide -- just think of Microsoft -- there will be those who start charitable foundations or give directly to existing nonprofits, educational institutions or organizations tied to a variety of causes. Some will ultimately choose the time-honored Silicon Valley tradition of using the spoils from one successful start-up to fund a fleet of new ones. But what makes Silicon Valley different from other places -- particularly Wall Street -- is that those who are made rich by their jobs tend to be, on average, circumspect about displaying their wealth. Yes, some of the towns around Palo Alto have street after street of enormous homes with beautiful lawns. And the area has Ferrari, Maserati, McClaren, Porsche and plenty of other high-end car dealerships. But the wise employees, following the lead of many who have trod this path before, will leave those expensive toys in the garage during the work week rather than flash the cash like the young bucks personified by Bud Fox in ""Wall Street."" Everyone who lives out here knows someone who has made it big, and many more equally talented entrepreneurs who haven't hit the golden IPO jackpot. Everyone old enough also remembers those who made it big in the first Internet wave and then lost it big just as quickly, when the market moved on or golden future promises turned into leaden current realities. Knowing that monetary success can be fleeting and watching the mistakes of those in the past who failed to take heed will likely have an impact on the spending patterns of even the youngest Facebook employee. Of course, they will celebrate, and maybe splurge. And they deserve to. They've worked hard to make Facebook one of the world's most high-profile companies. Investment advisers and charitable organizations will likely have as much reason to celebrate, as will the local real estate agents and fractional jet services, late this year after the IPO and the expiration of the share lockup period. (The money may not actually be available until late 2012 or even early 2013 depending on the timing of the actual IPO and other specific terms of the transaction.) Each Facebook employee will make his or her own decision about what to do next. Those in a great hurry to move on to other pursuits have probably already left. Most employees will stay put. Facebook headquarters probably won't look all that different after the IPO deal than before. Those pre-IPO options and shares are only the key to ""set for life"" as long as the company continues to perform well. After some well-deserved period of celebration late this year when Facebook actually goes public, it will be time to get back to work. After all, in some garage somewhere, a clever kid is already coding the foundation for the next ""biggest IPO ever."" Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- ""To report the state of the union."" Within the first few seconds of President Barack Obama's address Tuesday night, he quoted the late President John F. Kennedy, who 51 years ago used those words to describe a president's annual duty. As Obama spoke, citizens around the country were tapping away at keyboards, posting and sending messages -- public and private -- characterizing their own view of how the union, and its president, are faring. Obama told the packed House of Representatives chamber: . ""We can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger."" Rothkopf: This time, a president in full . And those citizens around the country, typing away, were in essence saying: . We'll be the ones to decide that, thank you very much. It is one of the most profound changes a modern president faces: The fact that the day is long gone when a chief executive can declare what the status of the nation is and have the words be treated as a one-directional proclamation rather than as the first salvo in an instant conversation. Twitter reported that as Obama discussed the middle class and minimum wages, its users were posting messages at the rate of 24,000 per minute. Tweets on State of the Union . The State of the Union address, for more than a century -- from Thomas Jefferson to Woodrow Wilson -- was not even delivered verbally to Congress. It was handed to the House and Senate on paper, and then printed -- usually in full -- in newspapers across the country. Americans studied the words as they would a major company's annual report. The official version -- the hot-off-the-presses results of the nation's yearly physical exam. The dynamic, of necessity, has been forever altered. Welch: Obama's 'do-something' plan for a 'have-nothing' government . ""I'm also issuing a new goal for America,"" Obama said Tuesday night, and before he could even complete the sentence, he had to know that there were plenty of people who would automatically reject whatever words would follow and would not be shy about it. Self-doubt is a characteristic that a modern president of either party must banish as he speaks. If he were to dwell on the fact that every single syllable he utters is being dissected in real time, it would be understandable if he were unable to make it through a paragraph. ""We know what needs to be done,"" Obama said, but that word -- ""we"" -- is itself open to daily dispute. A president's voice may be, symbolically, the loudest in the republic, but it is one voice among hundreds of millions, most of them with the technological power to talk right back. Democracy, at warp speed. Slaughter: Obama dares Congress to get the job done . That endless and instantaneous conversation -- and it is only going to grow more constant in the decades to come -- is the contemporary reality to which each president must now adjust, the fresh fact of civic life. It is, in a fundamental way, the new state of the union. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Presidents are required to report on the state of the union .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Wednesday proposed background checks on all gun sales and bans on military style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines as part of a package of steps to reduce gun violence in the wake of the Newtown school massacre last month. With relatives of some of the 20 children killed in the Connecticut rampage looking on, Obama signed 23 executive actions -- which don't require congressional approval -- to strengthen existing gun laws and take related steps on mental health and school safety. He also called on Congress to reinstate an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004, to restrict ammunition magazines to no more than 10 rounds, and to expand background checks to anyone buying a gun, whether at a store or in a private sale at an auction or convention. Senate Democrats hold key to passage of gun legislation . Referring to the young students killed in the Newtown shootings on December 14 and other victims of gun violence, Obama said the nation must do a better job of protecting its children, especially when they are in schools, shopping malls, movie theaters and other public places. While some of the steps he proposed are given little chance of winning congressional approval in the face of the nation's powerful gun lobby, Obama said all efforts must be made to reduce chronic gun violence in the country. ""This is our first task as a society -- keeping our children safe,"" the president said, adding that saving even one life would make the changes he seeks worth the effort. Read Obama's proposals . Republicans immediately rejected the Obama proposals as an attack on the constitutional right to bear arms. ""Nothing the president is proposing would have stopped the massacre at Sandy Hook,"" said a statement by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, considered an up-and-coming GOP leader. ""President Obama is targeting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens instead of seriously addressing the real underlying causes of such violence."" The powerful National Rifle Association said it would work with Congress to find what it called ""real solutions to protecting America's most valuable asset -- our children."" ""Attacking firearms and ignoring children is not a solution to the crisis we face as a nation,"" the NRA said in a statement. ""Only honest, law-abiding gun owners will be affected and our children will remain vulnerable to the inevitability of more tragedy."" Obama-backed gun bills considered a long shot in Congress . Gun rights at center of debate . NRA President David Keene said the ""Second Amendment is going to survive"" Obama's efforts on gun control. ""What we want to see is what they really have in mind. They've got bullet points. There's going to be a lot more to it than that,"" Keene said on CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."" Obama called accusations that he seeks to violate gun rights untrue, saying opponents want to wage a campaign of intimidation and fear instead of working with him for needed changes. ""We can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible law-breaking few from inflicting harm on a massive scale,"" he said. Gun control support rises but divide remains over what to do . Gun control supporters, including relatives of shooting victims, lauded Obama's proposals as a good first step to reduce gun violence and urged legislators to take on the difficult issue instead of reverting to partisan postures. ""When you are disheartened by the number of steps that have to be taken, by the fears of gun advocates, by the politics, please dig deep and find new heart,"" urged Emily Nottingham, the mother of Gabe Zimmerman, the legislative staffer killed in the 2010 Tuscon shooting that disabled Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona. ""Think for a moment about your young staffers, your children or grandchildren,"" Nottingham continued. ""Now imagine that that cell phone in your pocket is vibrating and the message says they have been murdered by a stranger with an assault weapon. Imagine that, then shore up your resolve and keep working to protect your staffers, our children, our nation. We need you to not give up."" However, Jerry Henry of the Georgiacarry.org website, which opposes tighter gun controls, told CNN that the Obama proposals were misdirected. ""He did absolutely nothing to address the criminal element,"" said Henry, who argued that studies show criminals get guns on the street instead of buying them from licensed gun shops that conduct background checks. Fully enforcing existing gun laws and making criminals serve their full prison terms would do more to halt gun violence, according to Henry, who added that government ""cannot legislate evil out of the minds of men."" Polls capture public sentiment . Vice President Joe Biden led a panel assembled by Obama to examine gun control steps after the Newtown shootings, which sparked a fierce public debate over how to prevent such mass killings. Biden's recommendations formed the basis of the package of proposals Obama announced Wednesday. ""The world has changed, and it's demanding action,"" Biden said at the White House event. Opponents promise a political fight, with an NRA spokesman saying Tuesday that the group has experienced what he called an ""unprecedented"" spike in membership numbers since new calls for gun control began in the past month. Approximately 250,000 people have joined the organization's existing 4.25 million members, according to NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. In addition, the NRA is receiving an influx of financial contributions, he said, adding: ""This is going to be a very expensive and hard-fought fight."" A CNN/Time Magazine/ORC International poll Wednesday indicated that Americans generally favor stricter gun control, but they don't believe that stricter gun laws alone would reduce gun violence. According to the survey, 55% of Americans generally favor stricter gun control laws, with 56% saying that it's currently too easy to buy guns in this country. However, only 39% say that stricter gun controls would reduce gun violence all by themselves. Obama called for citizens to let their elected representatives know what they think, saying: ""The only way we can change is if the American people demand it."" NRA draws heat over its new shooting game . He proposed legislative steps he previously has backed, such as reinstating the Clinton-era ban on assault weapons, and also requested that funds be made available to help treat mental illness and provide schools with support to enhance their safety. His executive actions signed Wednesday called for tougher enforcement of existing laws and required federal agencies to provide data for background checks. A senior administration official told reporters the price tag for the entire package was $500 million. Obama also said he would nominate B. Todd Jones, the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to become its permanent chief. The agency has been without a full-time director for six years. A main focus of Obama's steps was closing loopholes in background checks. While requiring universal background checks would require congressional approval, some of the executive actions signed by Obama were intended to bolster the existing system. Across the country, more than a million people failed background checks to buy guns during the past 14 years because of criminal records, drug use or mental health issues, according to FBI figures. That figure, however, is a small fraction of overall gun sales. Opinion: America's gun problem is not a race problem . ""If you look at the combination of likelihood of passage and effectiveness of curbing gun crime, universal background checks is at the sweet spot,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, a leading backer of such screening. Obama also called for more money to strengthen gun safety at schools, including hiring more counselors such as retired law enforcement officers to help educate students on gun issues. He also called for more funding for communities to hire more police officers, but stopped short of seeking the NRA's proposal for armed guards at every school. The CNN/Time/ORC poll Wednesday showed that respondents favored armed guards in schools by 54%-45%. Congressional hearings planned . Legislators said working with Congress will be paramount in curbing gun violence. California Rep. Mike Thompson told CNN on Tuesday that a ban on high-capacity magazines could garner Republican support, but a full-scale assault weapon ban would be hard to get passed in the GOP-controlled House. House and Senate committees said they would start holding hearings on gun control measures in coming weeks. Oregon sheriff: 'Unconstitutional' gun control laws won't be enforced . In New York, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday signed into law a series of new gun regulations -- the nation's first since the Newtown shootings. Both New York's GOP-controlled Senate and Democrat-controlled Assembly approved the measure by overwhelming margins. It includes a statewide gun registry and adds a uniform licensing standard across the state, altering the current system, in which each county or municipality sets a standard. Residents are also restricted to purchasing ammunition magazines that carry seven bullets, rather than 10. Keene derided outlawing high-capacity magazines as ""a bidding match"" that focuses on the wrong issue. ""So the president says you don't need 30-round magazines. How about a 10-round magazine? Andrew Cuomo says, 'Well, I can do better than that. I'll make it a seven-round magazine,'"" Keene said. ""The fact of the matter is the kinds of people who do this, particularly the mentally unbalanced -- who are the most likely people to do it -- shouldn't have any magazines,"" he said. ""The changes in New York are largely cosmetic,"" said CNN legal analyst Paul Callan, who described state's existing regulations as ""the toughest gun laws in the United States."" Lawmakers in at least 10 other states are reviewing some form of new gun regulations in the new year. Mexico watching with interest .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama delivers the first State of the Union address of his second term on Tuesday. Here are five things to watch for as the president lays out his second-term agenda: . 1. Slap and tickle . Sources say the president will point out bipartisan progress on immigration reform but he'll take it to the GOP on debt and tax reform. Already, Republicans are bracing to play victim. Tally up the jabs and weigh them against mentions of common ground. That will be an early scorecard for Wednesday-morning quarterbacking. Obama set to challenge and persuade . 2. Wish lists . Expect to forget what the president says. Nothing personal, Mr. President, but State of the Union addresses are notoriously forgotten. John F. Kennedy was a great orator -- quick, what did he say in his State of the Unions? How about Reagan? They're just not great venues for rhetoric. Granted, the Monroe Doctrine and the Four Freedoms were both laid out in State of the Unions, but in general they tend to be laundry lists for party policy wishes. 8 memorable State of the Union moments . 3. What he doesn't say . An average of 44 million people have watched Obama deliver previous State of the Union addresses. His aides say a huge audience equals a huge opportunity. So, will he seize the opportunity to answer his critics and respond to his base on issues including: U.S. use of unmanned drones, the legal rationale for targeting Americans, U.S. policy in Syria, Iran's nuclear program, and security of U.S. diplomatic posts? On the domestic front, will he address poverty in the United States? Will any of these controversial issues make the cut? State of the Union to focus on jobs, wages and the economy . 4. Keep count . Count how many times your issue gets mentioned. While presidential speechwriters insist the amount of time dedicated to an issue in most speeches doesn't matter as much as the language used to describe it, the State of the Union is an exception. That's because every word is debated. Aides say this speech will be heavy on economic themes. But look to see how much time Obama spends on the other issues he outlined in his inaugural address, including gay rights, women's rights, climate change and education. Mentions matter. Republicans, Democrats suggest priorities ahead of State of the Union . 5. Will she or won't she? Serious people don't care -- or so they say. But since first lady Michelle Obama shocked tout de D.C. by showing her guns in the heroes box during the president's 2009 joint address to Congress, her outfit has become one of the best (sometimes only) surprises of the night. Will she bare her arms again? Right now, it's one of the most closely held secrets in Washington. Obama to announce 34,000 troops to come home .","Will Obama's GOP jabs outweigh any olive branches?

"Washington (CNN) -- The White House said President Barack Obama supports reinstatement of a federal ban on assault weapons -- a position he took in the 2008 campaign but failed to press during his first term. ""It does remain a commitment of his,"" presidential spokesman Jay Carney told reporters as the nation reeled from a mass shooting in Connecticut that mainly killed school children. An emotional Obama did not address that issue directly in a televised statement from the White House on the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown that killed 26 people, but he said something had to be done. ""We're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics,"" said Obama, the father of two girls. He wiped away tears when he spoke of the ""beautiful little kids"" killed in the massacre. Complete coverage on the Connecticut school shooting . Police recovered three weapons from the scene: a semiautomatic .223-caliber rifle made by Bushmaster, a Glock and a Sig Sauer, both handguns, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. Others also spoke out for a strong federal response. ""We cannot simply accept this as a routine product of modern American life. If now is not the time to have a serious discussion about gun control and the epidemic of gun violence plaguing our society, I don't know when is,"" Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-New York, said in a statement. Witness: At least 100 rounds fired . Congress approved a ban on assault weapons in 1994. The prohibition, which expired in 2004, did not eliminate them, but restricted their features, limiting magazine capacity to 10 rounds and regulating pistol grips, bayonet attachments and flash suppressors. Gun rights generally divide Americans. A Pew poll conducted after the 2011 assassination attempt on Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, which killed six other people, found that 49% of Americans said it was ""more important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns,"" while 46% said it was ""more important to control gun ownership."" But a survey conducted by CNN/ORC International in August shortly after the deadly theater mass shooting earlier this year in Aurora, Colorado, found that 76% of those surveyed believe ""there should be some restrictions on owning guns."" Tweets from the shooting . Obama supported a platform while running for president in 2008 that included reinstating the assault weapons ban, but has largely avoided the issue of gun control during his first term. He wrote an opinion piece two months after the Giffords shooting acknowledging the importance of the Second Amendment right to bear arms and called for a ""focus"" on ""effective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible, law-breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place."" Obama said at a presidential debate in October that he wanted a ""broader conversation"" in general about reducing gun violence. ""Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced,"" he said. The National Rifle Association, which advocates for gun rights, said in a statement that it would not have any comment on the Connecticut shooting ""until the facts are thoroughly known."" Kristin Goss, an associate professor of public policy and political science at Duke University and author of ""Disarmed: The Missing Movement for Gun Control in America,"" said earlier this year that the pro-gun control side of the issue ""has struggled to come up with a compelling narrative"" to persuade more people to support stricter gun laws. ""For a long time, these gun violence rates and massacres spoke for themselves. They relied on that to make the case but were up against a very powerful but very well-disciplined and skillful army that was good at taking those arguments apart,"" Goss said.

"(CNN) -- Sen. Marco Rubio was ready for his close-up, and he got it. Now you know what all the fuss is about. Rubio, a rising star and possible 2016 GOP presidential hopeful, was picked to deliver the official Republican response to President Obama's State of the Union Address. The selection tells you a lot about what the Republican Party has in store for Rubio, and what this 41-year-old son of Cuban immigrants can do for a party that needs to become more user-friendly for Latinos. His remarks were also delivered in Spanish. Rubio's delivery was solid, his voice strong, and his passion unmistakable. The senator from Florida is an excellent communicator whose life experience -- as the son of a bartender and hotel maid who worked hard so their children could get ahead -- is easy for many Americans to connect with. In the Republican Party, there are the multimillionaires -- and then there is Marco. And the message that Rubio sought to communicate Tuesday night -- about how making America prosperous comes from growing the middle class, expanding opportunity and protecting economic freedom, and not from increasing the footprint of government -- came through loud and clear. LZ Granderson: Rubio missed the year of the woman . Rubio knows that the Republican Party has a reputation as the party of the rich. That happens when you nominate as your party's presidential candidate someone worth $250 million. So he had this message for Obama: . ""Mr. President, I still live in the same working-class neighborhood I grew up in. My neighbors aren't millionaires. They're retirees who depend on Social Security and Medicare. They're workers who have to get up early tomorrow morning and go to work to pay the bills. They're immigrants, who came here because they were stuck in poverty in countries where the government dominated the economy. The tax increases and the deficit spending you propose will hurt middle-class families. It will cost them their raises. It will cost them their benefits. It may even cost some of them their jobs. And it will hurt seniors because it does nothing to save Medicare and Social Security. So Mr. President, I don't oppose your plans because I want to protect the rich. I oppose your plans because I want to protect my neighbors."" That is the sweet spot. Rubio understands that the best hope of the Republican Party is for it to establish itself as the party not of the rich, but of those who aspire to one day be rich. And speaking of immigrants, Rubio already has one accomplishment in that arena -- albeit an indirect one. Obama's supporters like to tout his announcement last June that his administration would offer young illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children the chance to avoid deportation by applying for deferred action and a temporary work permit. What they forget to mention is that the only reason that Obama did this was because Rubio was working on a bill that would have offered this group of young people permanent relief by giving them legal status. GOP's Rubio rips Obama . Now Rubio is part of a bipartisan group of senators, the ""group of eight,"" that wants to tackle immigration reform by, among other things, offering the undocumented an earned pathway to citizenship. It's not something that Rubio -- who used to have the support of the tea party but no longer appears to, at least on immigration -- would have considered a few years ago. This is a kinder and gentler Marco, and also a wiser one. When he entered the Senate, he expressed support for the ghastly immigration law in Arizona, which has served as a recipe for racial profiling of Latinos. He also opposed the DREAM Act, which would have offered legal status to young illegal immigrants who went to college or joined the military. But in January 2012, I saw Rubio give a speech in Miami that gave me hope that he was coming around. He talked about how the Republican Party could not just be the party that opposed illegal immigration but also had to be the party that encouraged legal immigration. And he acknowledged something that too few Republicans have the guts to admit -- that there are those in their party whose tone, on this issue, is much too mean and intolerant and divisive for their own good. Talk Back: Is giving the State of the Union response a political 'kiss of death'? Honestly, I don't know how much of this is real and how much has been manufactured by Team Rubio in advance of a possible run at the presidency. On immigration, there is a long list of politicians -- in both parties -- who have undergone extreme makeovers. Obama has been on multiple sides of the issue, deporting DREAMers one minute and offering them a reprieve the next. Rubio wouldn't be the first to change his tune. Overall, Rubio established himself as a force to be reckoned with, in the Republican Party and beyond. His detractors -- most of them loyal Democrats and Obama supporters -- were anxious to find fault with his remarks, but he gave them little to work with. There was that one awkward moment near the end where Rubio, his voice cracking and his throat dry, quickly reached for a bottle of water. Social media lit up. His critics joked that the gesture was such a terrible distraction that Americans should just ignore the whole speech. Really? The water didn't bother me. But Rubio's remarks did make me thirsty for new leadership in the White House. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Marco Rubio presented GOP response to Obama's State of the Union .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The list of house rules make it clear what one Singaporean working mother expects of her new maids. ""You cannot choose your food... I will decide the type of food to buy for you. You cannot use the washing machine or dryer... you must hand wash your own clothes and bed sheets. And if (the children) fall down, it's your fault."" ""Tamarind,"" as she's known, lists the rules on her blog, which is advertised as ""primarily for employers who have suffered at the hands of bad maids."" She says her maids aren't punished, if they break the rules, but firm guidance is needed early on. Just over 200,000 maids, or foreign domestic workers (FDW), live and work in one in six households in Singapore, according to migrant advocacy group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2). They came in large numbers in the 1980s when the government encouraged more women and highly skilled workers into the economy, creating the need for more help at home and the money to pay for it. Since then, the city-state has come to rely so much upon its imported help that the government is struggling to balance the demands of its local population with criticism that it's doing too little to protect workers' rights. ""What's really striking is that Singapore has done a good job of addressing cases of physical and sexual abuse against domestic workers... but they have really fallen behind the norm in terms of not including these workers under the labor law and considering them as workers,"" says Nisha Varia from Human Rights Watch. ""It's something Singapore should feel really embarrassed about."" While maids are recognized under Singapore's Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, the legislation doesn't regulate pay or working hours. That is agreed in a contract between the employer and employee, along with their recruitment company. While the standard contract asks parties to nominate one day off a month (to be paid in lieu, if the maid chooses to forgo it), the Act only requires employers to provide ""adequate rest."" Employers who fail to comply can be fined up to $5,000 (US$3,900) and jailed for up to six months. In 2010, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) says it took action against 26 employers for failure to provide adequate food, rest or medical care. In the first half of 2011, nine were held to account. ""Most FDW employers are responsible and treat their FDWs well,"" a government spokesperson said. Yet, according to a survey released this year by Transient Workers Count Too, only 12% of Singapore's foreign domestic workers, mostly women from Indonesia and the Philippines, were granted a day off each week. Just over half had a day off each month. ""One of the things we noticed from the responses of employers is a kind of panicked reaction when we start talking about a day off,"" says TWC2's executive director Vincent Wijeysingha. ""I think that's based on the fact that we've come to depend so much on our domestic workers for everything. You see them running the household, shopping, paying bills and looking after vulnerable people in the family. ""The key reason why we need them is because there are no affordable childcare services and no affordable elderly daycare services. So this represents the cheapest social policy option,"" he says. Tamarind gives her current maid two days off a month and doesn't believe the law should be changed. ""In Singapore, most Chinese husbands do not help with house work and children. If all maids have a day off every week that would mean that full-time working mothers have no rest at all,"" she told CNN. She adds: ""Maids are not as vulnerable as you think. Many maids will agree to a contract with no day off at first. Then a few months later they ask for a day off; otherwise, they will ask to transfer to a new employer."" ""Many people think that maids are forced to work with one employer due to the contract. The truth is that the contract is useless,"" she says. Tamarind says her maid would prefer to earn extra money than take a day off -- something Human Rights Watch says only underscores how little domestic workers are paid. ""They're being paid so little that they can't even afford to take off that one day a week,"" Varia says, adding, ""A lot of them are doing this to survive and to support their families back home."" Nining Djohar worked for three years as a maid in Singapore before she was allowed a day off. And even then it was only after she changed employers. ""Of course I am very tired and I can not tell about anything. Three months after going with my employer I wanted to go out. Because the house is so big, there are two children also, two babies. Then after that... yell yell yell, everything is wrong. I try to call my agency, but the agency is no more,"" she says. Conditions have improved since Djohar left Singapore in 2003, with the introduction of the standard contract in 2006. Djohar now works for Migrant Care in Jakarta, helping other Indonesian women to navigate the system. ""All of the people ask me one thing; one day off every Sunday,"" she says. Singapore's Ministry of Manpower says it's conducting an ""ongoing"" review of domestic workers rights and the responsibilities of employers, including the ""suggestion"" of legislated rest days. Human Rights Watch says no matter what the review reveals, the government has a moral duty to legislate days off.","HRW: Singapore ""should be embarrassed"" about record on domestic worker rights .

"(CNN) -- Special operations troops at a small military outpost in Afghanistan gave alcohol and steroid-like drugs to a U.S. Army sergeant accused of killing 16 Afghan civilians, the soldier's lawyer said Thursday. Attorney John Henry Browne said the special operations troops ""pumped"" Staff Sgt. Robert Bales with the substances. ""He was provided all these things,"" Browne told CNN. ""Special forces were in charge."" Bales is accused of murder in the death of the 16 civilians, including children, in March 2012. Prosecutors say Bales slipped off the base after dark and went from house to house, shooting villagers. In addition to the dead, six people were wounded. Witnesses testified last year that Bales had consumed alcohol with other soldiers before the attack. He also was charged with illicit use of steroids and alcohol. Browne said last year that ""steroid use is going to be an issue in this case, especially where Sgt. Bales got steroids and how he got steroids."" Browne said Wednesday that Bales intends to plead guilty to the killings in exchange for elimination of the death penalty as a possible punishment. If the deal is approved by the military judge and a commanding general, Browne will mount the argument about steroids and alcohol at a penalty phase hearing to determine whether parole will be a possibility as part the life sentence he could receive. The Army would not comment on any potential deal Wednesday. A hearing in the case is scheduled for June 5. Browne has previously said the Army erred in assigning Bales to another combat tour despite evidence of post-traumatic stress disorder and a traumatic brain injury suffered during a combat tour in Iraq. Bales, he said Thursday, was a ""broken man."" ""We broke him. He never should have been there,"" he said. Browne said he will bring experts in combat stress to the penalty phase hearing, despite the fact that the military has historically not accepted combat stress as the sole explanation for crimes committed by service members. The strategy outlined by Browne is one he has pursued since taking on the case last year. We think the Army is attempting to escape responsibility for the decision to send Sgt. Bales to Afghanistan for his fourth deployment, knowing that he had (post-traumatic stress disorder) and a concussive head injury,"" Browne said last year. ""I think that the person who made the decision to send Sgt. Bales to the most dangerous area in Afghanistan in a small outpost is responsible for Sgt. Bales being in Afghanistan, and he should have never been there."" The shooting spree strained already tense U.S.-Afghan relations and intensified a debate about whether to pull out American troops ahead of their planned 2014 withdrawal. Afghan authorities have called for swift action. ""He committed a mass killing crime, and we would like the court in the United States to implement justice and punish him according to the crime,"" said Ahmad Zia Syamak, spokesman for Afghan President Hamid Karzai.","Special ops troops gave alcohol and steroids to soldier accused of killing Afghans, lawyer says .

"Rancho Palos Verdes, California (CNN) -- Motorola says it will produce the first smartphone manufactured in the United States. Called Moto X, the phone will be assembled at a 500,000-square-foot plant near Fort Worth, Texas, that will employ about 2,000 people. The majority of smartphones today are manufactured in Asia. The Moto X is scheduled to hit the market by the end of the year. It's the first new phone to be designed entirely under the ownership of Google, which bought Motorola Mobility last year. Dennis Woodside, CEO of Motorola Mobility, announced the news Wednesday at the D11 tech conference being hosted by AllThingsD, the tech-news site. The phone is packed with new features that can anticipate users' needs such as ""when to fire up the camera,"" Woodside said. For example, sensors in the phone will let it know when it's being pulled out of someone's pocket, he said. The phone will also adjust its settings if it's traveling at high speeds in a car, he said. ""The device will know, whether it's on or off, it's traveling at 60 miles per hour. It's going to act differently so you can interact with it safely,"" Woodside said. The phone is ""more contextually aware of what's going on around it. It allows you to interact with it in very different ways than you can with other devices,"" Woodside added. He did not show the device onstage during his talk, although he said he had it in his pocket. Woodside hinted that the Moto X would go on sale this fall and be priced below competing phones such as the IPhone 5. He said that 70% of the phone will be assembled at a Texas facility that once made Nokia phones, although some of its components will be built overseas. Motorola's news follows similar announcements by Chinese computer maker Lenovo, which is building a manufacturing plant in North Carolina, and Apple, which has said it will begin manufacturing a Mac computer in the U.S. this year.","Motorola says it will make the first smartphone manufactured in the United States .

"Washington (CNN) -- Ron Paul supporters were never that trusting of his son, Rand Paul. To ardent Ron Paul legions who energized his bid for the presidency around his libertarian principles, Rand Paul reflected a corrupt, business-as-usual political system -- one that asked people to compromise their beliefs in the quest for power. They saw Ron Paul, a former Texas congressman, rising above that until this week when Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator who is viewed as a potential presidential candidate in 2016, blazed his own path toward their hearts and minds. He appealed to civil libertarians at their core by challenging the White House nominee to head the CIA, and pushing the Obama administration to clarify -- not once, but twice -- its policy on targeting Americans in counter-terror operations with lethal force. He threw the faithful a healthy portion of red political meat with a 13-hour filibuster over John Brennan, who was confirmed to the CIA post on Thursday. Brennan was President Barack Obama's chief counter-terrorism adviser. Rand Paul highlighted his dissatisfaction with the response of the administration to his question of whether it could use a drone to kill Americans on U.S. soil. The issue resonates with both libertarians on the far right and liberals on the far left by challenging what they consider to be excessive government powers. In particular, Paul sought clarity that only a war enemy -- even if a U.S. citizen -- could be targeted. His Senate marathon amounted to a libertarian clinic. He quoted libertarian thinkers, emphasized the infallibility of the Constitution and elevated the drone discussion. And Ron Paul devotees noticed. ""I think this definitely scored him some points,"" said Gary Franchi, the former chair of the Revolution PAC. ""I was getting a lot of messages from people saying 'Wow, Rand is stepping up.' People were really positive about it."" ""You have to give credit where credit is due and when someone does something that is clearly fighting for the people's liberty, then regardless of how you feel about that person, you have to take notice,"" Jordan Page, an ardent Paul supporter and musician for the campaign said. ""Rand, these days, is the lone senator standing up against injustice."" During the 2012 campaign, Ron Paul wielded great of influence among a small, but fervent, group of supporters. That passion turned into a fundraising operation that even establishment Republican candidates envied. When Ron Paul withdrew from the Republican race, more establishment members of the party saw Rand Paul as the inheritor of his father's following. Many in the Ron Paul movement challenged that assumption. Then Rand Paul began to speak shortly before noon on Wednesday. ""I rise today to begin to filibuster John Brennan's nomination for the CIA. I will speak until I can no longer speak. I will speak as long as it takes,"" he said. Blogs dedicated to the liberty movement, a nickname for the Ron Paul campaign, began to blow up with posts about the filibuster. Radio shows dedicated to Ron Paul scrapped their original programming and covered Rand Paul live. And the hashtag #standwithRand, a tag that has long been used by libertarian supporters of Rand Paul, began to trend worldwide. As the hours ticked by, Rand Paul's image among Ron Paul supporters began to change. Even those who ardently opposed Rand Paul during his father's 2012 campaign for president began to soften. ""I was skeptical of Rand Paul from the beginning,"" said John Bush, a radio host and event organizer for the 2012 Ron Paul campaign. ""I appreciate what Rand Paul did last night and I think it sent a very strong message. I have a much higher opinion of him than I did before."" The distrust of Rand Paul stems from Senate votes and decisions he made during the 2012 campaign. In particular, Ron Paul supporters have pointed to Rand Paul's support of Israel and use of economic sanctions, which they see as overstepping the bounds of American power, as a few of the many reasons they were skeptical of the junior senator from Kentucky. ""The reason why Ron Paul got such a following was because he was pillar with his principles,"" Mike Salvi, a Philadelphia-based Ron Paul organizer said during the 2012 campaign. ""I don't see that in Rand."" Distrust deepened when Rand Paul endorsed Mitt Romney for president last July. Many Ron Paul supporters were still angling for influence at the Republican National Convention and were appalled at the decision. They felt the senator betrayed his father, cementing long held skepticism. ""Mitt Romney was the straw that broke the camel's back,"" said Chuck Suter, a Ron Paul supporter who organized events for the presidential campaign. Suter, who supported Rand Paul throughout Ron Paul's presidential campaign, said that the Romney endorsement was incredibly difficult to defend. He said he took heat from outspoken Ron Paul supporters. Suter said that Rand Paul's filibuster provided some vindication. ""What last night did for me was it affirmed everything that I had done even when it was hard for me to go out and defend Rand when he endorsed Romney,"" Suter said. ""Last night was the shining jewel of what Rand Paul is all about, to play politics where his father may have not."" Hammered by conservatives on Twitter to #StandWithRand, a number of more establishment senators streamed into the Senate to relieve Paul of his speaking duties and support his cause. They included Sen. Marco Rubio, who many see as the frontrunner for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and someone who Ron Paul supporters view as anointed by the establishment. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the personification of ""establishment"" to many Paul supporters, also took part. To many Paul supporters, that sort of high-profile backing was icing on the cake. ""Everybody use to say there is no point in working with the GOP because of the mindset that there is no way that you can get Mitch McConnell and Marco Rubio to stand on the ... floor like that,"" Suter said. ""Last night changed things."" And although Paul has said he won't make a decision about a 2016 race until next year, his prolonged filibuster has warmed the mood among once doubtful libertarians. ""I wouldn't mind if Rand Paul was president,"" said Bush, a voter who said he isn't sure he even support the idea of the presidency. ""It would certainly be better than Marco Rubio or Mitt Romney or any of the other goons that the GOP will put up for the nomination.""","Rand Paul's 13-hour filibuster helped him gain respect from father's 2012 supporters .

"(CNN) -- Two iconic women with seemingly radically different world views died recently, leaving legacies of humor, pioneering spirit, and striking public personas. As divergent as their styles were, former Cosmopolitan editor Helen Gurley Brown and comedian Phyllis Diller each used their appearance as a means to an end: Diller to make herself the butt of the joke, Gurley Brown to get ahead personally and professionally -- and to show generations of women how to do the same. Whether chasing beauty or mocking it, these women broke ground by reflecting and reshaping the values of their eras while paving the way for the women behind them. Original mad women . Like Peggy Olson in the AMC TV series ""Mad Men,"" at midcentury Diller and Gurley Brown both worked as advertising copywriters early in their careers. They each segued into more recognizable versions of themselves as they approached their 40s, carefully crafting their looks and personas into brands that would become instantly recognizable to the American public. Both women would display a penchant for plastic surgery and outlandish style, using themselves as canvases to depict the life of the modern woman. A girly Gurley . In an era when settling into marriage and family young was the norm, Gurley Brown married at 37 and took over the helm of Cosmopolitan magazine at 43, a position she held for more than three decades. Her 1962 book ""Sex and the Single Girl,"" was the precursor to ""Sex and the City."" It was also the hopeful embodiment of the ""fun, fearless female"" ethos later instilled in hopeful Cosmo girls everywhere. In reality, Gurley Brown, who died last week at 90, gave up the single life to become the devoted wife to husband David Brown until his death in 2010. (A New York Times obituary quotes her as saying, ""I looked after him like a geisha girl."") But she never gave up her fun, flirty, single-girl attitude. Throughout it all, she exhibited a carefully lacquered persona, almost painfully thin, perfectly coiffed and manicured, with the occasional nip and tuck to retain her trademark waif-like look. Pretty ugly . At the age of 37, Phyllis Diller was a harried homemaker and mother of five, who followed her husband's advice to try her hand at humor writing and performing. Unlike the perfectly polished TV counterparts of her era, such as Harriet Nelson or June Cleaver, Diller presented a more realistic version of marriage and motherhood that had more in common with ""The Munsters"" than ""I Love Lucy."" And people loved it. Diller, who passed away Monday at 95, chose not to represent a prettified version of her life, but rather the outrageous extremes of family. Fictionalized versions of family members in her act included husband Fang, mother-in-law Moby Dick and sister-in-law Captain Bligh. Diller's exaggerated makeup and wigs and outlandish costumes deliberately disguised her plain, if not beautiful face and womanly curves. In a 2006 interview in TV Guide, Diller talks about posing for Playboy magazine. As the legend goes, the editors hoped her appearance would be played for laughs but were disappointed to discover that instead of being bony and unattractive, she was simply shaped like a woman. Making up . In a previous incarnation, I worked as a celebrity makeup artist and, among other things, worked with various Cosmo cover girls. They all seemed impossibly tall, aloof and preternaturally beautiful. I remember blushing to the roots of my hair at my first shoot after being singled out by Gurley Brown, who complimented my beautiful skin. Helen Gurley Brown's complicated feminist legacy . In 2006, I was called out of cosmetic retirement to do the makeup for the cover of a now-defunct literary magazine celebrating female writers and editors. I was delighted to see Gurley Brown, clad in her signature fire engine red suit and fishnets. At 84, she was frailer than I remembered, but still sizzling. I reminded her of our previous interactions and she looked at me and said, ""That's well and good, and you still look pretty, but what have you done since then?"" I was struck by the fact that a woman who had built an empire atop the cult of female perfection didn't think that looking pretty was enough. Pretty powerful pioneers . Both Helen Gurley Brown and Phyllis Diller created idealized versions of themselves to sell their products. Both were groundbreaking thinkers, businesswomen and performers. In one way or another, both used their faces and bodies as their calling cards. Remembering Phyllis Diller . Gurley Brown paved the way for women like Jane Pratt to create careers and publications that celebrated the multi-faceted modern woman. She also made room for magazines including Bust and Bitch or websites like Jezebel that thumb their nose at everything she'd worked for and stood for. Diller opened the door for comedians like Carol Burnett to ridicule the classic feminine ideal (see Burnett's riotous Scarlett O'Hara bit), and for Roseanne Barr to lead a sitcom as the anti-mom in looks, shape and demeanor. More than that, she led the way for traditionally feminine-looking, yet frequently foul-mouthed comedians including Sarah Silverman and Chelsea Handler to be outrageous while remaining attractive. Gurley Brown and Diller were tough and successful and lived life by their own rules. They were two sides of a coin that paid the dues for women in today's media landscape.

"(CNN) -- People in the central United States suffered through more severe weather Thursday -- in the form of torrential rain, golf-ball-size hail and damaging winds, including a few reported tornadoes -- and braced for even more storms. Tornado warnings were issued at one point or another Thursday afternoon for portions of Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Wisconsin and Oklahoma. Just 10 days ago, Oklahoma was in the cross hairs of a powerful tornado that left 24 dead. Such warnings go out when witnesses or radar indicate a tornado. The National Weather Service, in fact, noted there were reports of tornadoes in at least seven communities in western Arkansas -- as far west as Polk, as far south as Garland County, and as far north as Oden. At least nine people statewide suffered injuries -- four minor ones in Oden, three in Clark County and two hurt by a lightning strike in Benton County -- state emergency management spokesman Tommy Jackson told CNN. No details were immediately available on the conditions of any of those injured. Two homes were destroyed in the small community of Oden, about 50 miles west of Hot Springs, according to Jackson. The weather service noted, too, that power lines were knocked down and Highway 88 was blocked at one point. Three houses were reportedly damaged and three people were injured, around the small Clark County town of Amity, according to the same agency. Tornadoes also were reported in north-central Oklahoma -- including in and around Perkins and Ripley, which is about 10 miles east. Shortly after 3 p.m. (4 p.m. ET), the National Weather Service tweeted that a tornado ""may be developing ... south of Perkins,"" which is about 50 miles northeast of Oklahoma City. Minutes later, a new message stated there had been a ""brief tornado"" reported that had ""dissipated."" Later Thursday night, a tornado was reported in Broken Arrow, which is about 15 miles southeast of Tulsa. There are personnel on the scene, but officials have no confirmed reports of damage from the incident, Tulsa County emergency management official Kaitlyn Cross said. The threat, and impact, of severe weather extended well beyond Arkansas and Oklahoma. Tornado watches -- which means conditions are favorable for tornadoes to form, though one hasn't necessarily touched down -- at one time extended through an eight-state stretch extending from Texas north to Michigan. The weather service, for example, noted that a tornado was reported Thursday evening in Prophetstown, Illinois, though it's not know if it caused any damage. With or without confirmed funnel clouds, these storms packed a wallop. The weather service's Tulsa office, for instance, noted one line of thunderstorms could also pack 70-mph wind gusts. Oklahoma weather experts also noted reports of half-dollar-size hail. Flooding was the problem in places like Coffeyville, Kansas, where police rescued people from 16 vehicles in a 1Â½-hour stretch on Thursday afternoon after they got trapped due to intense flooding, fire department Capt. Wayne Joplin said. Water in the streets went up to cars' headlights, if not higher, after ""torrential rain"" fell on ground already saturated by storms the previous night. ""The gutters and our storm system couldn't handle it,"" the captain said. ""I've lived here since 1979, and I've never seen that much rain that quick,"" Joplin told CNN. Even once night sets in Thursday, that doesn't mean everyone can breathe easy. The weather service's Storm Prediction Center is forecasting a moderate chance of severe weather in parts of Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arkansas and Missouri on Friday. The forecast is less dire Saturday, but on Sunday parts of the Northeast could be in danger. The Storm Prediction Center says there is a 30% or higher probability for severe thunderstorms Sunday in parts of seven states, including the cities of Scranton, Pennsylvania; Springfield, Massachusetts; and of the New York cities of Syracuse, Albany and Elmira. CNN's Carma Hassan and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: A tornado is reported outside Tulsa; an official says no confirmed damage .

"(CNN) -- Lukas Rosol shocked the sporting world, and perhaps even himself, by defeating two-time champion Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon, but the unknown Czech is not the first to have triumphed against seemingly impossible odds. The history of sport is littered with tales of underdogs toppling heavily-fancied favorites. But how is it that Rosol, ranked 100th in the world and having won just 17 ATP Tour matches prior to Thursday, can rise to the occasion and defeat an 11-time grand slam winner such as Nadal? Rosol sends Nadal crashing out of Wimbledon . ""It's always far easier to strive for a goal than achieve it,"" tennis coach Pete McCraw explained to CNN when asked about how sport's ""Davids"" can get the better of imposing ""Goliaths."" ""It's all mental, you either believe or you don't,"" he said. ""Truly believe and, as a result, you give yourself a real chance of both playing well and achieving victory in the moment. In the end, so few believe and just want to not get embarrassed."" McCraw, the current director of coaching for Tennis New Zealand, believes the main difference between title-winning stars like second seed Nadal and underachieving journeymen, such as the 26-year-old Rosol, is mentality and an innate belief in their own ability. Who is Lukas Rosol? ""Champions really live in a different place than the rest - they dare to dream,"" he said. ""They have the courage to believe and the confidence to create. The result : they succeed. ""In tennis, when any highly-ranked player is taken to five sets, or three in the women's game, the lower-ranked player drops their level. In the end, they hand victory to the higher-rated player."" But Rosol did not drop his level. The Wimbledon singles debutant produced devastating strokes in the fifth set to pummel Nadal into submission and reach the third round. His only other appearance on the hallowed grass courts ended in a first-round doubles defeat last year. The 26-year-old's bullish approached impressed observers all over the world, so is aggression the key to overcoming an imposing opponent? ""You don't make top 100 or even the top 10, let alone win a grand slam, by being aggressive all the time,"" said McCraw, who has worked extensively with stars such as Maria Sharapova and Jelena Jankovic. ""The scoreboard rewards conservative decision-making, the court rewards percentage cross-court tennis. No different to golf -- getting up and down in two shots rather than hitting for the pin. The margins are just not there. ""He played to win, backed himself and held his line at the critical time. It's what you train for all your career, so when the moment arrives there should be nothing to fear as you have been preparing for this for years."" Despite his scintillating performance, two tennis greats have questioned whether Rosol can advance past his next match against German 27th seed Philipp Kohlschreiber. Eight-time grand slam champion Jimmy Connors tweeted: ""In â€ªtennis we call Rosol a stopper, he won't win or even go deep in tournament but he will stop a top seed from advancing."" Rosol's compatriot Martina Navratilova, winner of 18 major singles titles, agreed: ""Happy for Lukas Rosol, but really feeling bad for Rafa. Would be shocked if Rosol can get anywhere near that form again."" But McCraw argues that speculation over Rosol's chances in the rest of the tournament is irrelevant, and all that matters is celebrating his remarkable win. ""Who cares, sport is about on the day, on your merit, and Rosol took his chance, he had a go and backed himself on the day and was rewarded. ""It's got nothing to do with how far he goes after that, only that on this day he lived his dreams, played to or above his potential and the moment rewarded him with a victory. ""Whether he believes in himself again or not, wins another round or not is irrelevant -- that's sports as it is life.""","Lukas Rosol beat No. 2 seed Rafael Nadal in five sets at Wimbledon .

"(CNN) -- In what country would the presidential palace auction off some of its finest wines to buy more wine and boost state coffers? France, bien sûr! The Élysée Palace -- the official residence of the French president -- has dipped into its wine cellars and put 1,200 bottles up for auction in Paris. Mainly from Bordeaux and Burgundy, the wines would normally have been served to ambassadors or visiting dignitaries as they dined with the president, showing off the finest of French viticulture in the process. The funds raised will allow the renewal of the palace's wine stocks, auction house Drouot said. ""More modest"" wines will be bought in place of some of the fine vintages put under the hammer, with any extra money left poured back into the state budget, it said. The Élysée's head sommelier, Virginie Routis, picked the wines to be auctioned off in two sales, on Thursday and Friday. The 1,200 bottles represent about a tenth of the cellar's total stocks. Some date back decades, while others are newer but represent great vintages. The auction house expects the bids to range between 15 euros ($19) for the most ordinary and an estimated 2,200 euros ($2,800) for a 1990 Petrus. Many bidders should be able to get their hands on a bottle for less than 100 euros, the auction house said. All the bottles auctioned off will sport a label stating that they came from the Élysée Palace, with the date of their sale, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. The palace cellar was set up in 1947, during the presidency of Vincent Auriol, and was reorganized in 1995 to ensure the best conditions for keeping the wines. Built up over decades, it includes wines from Alsace, the Champagne region, the Rhône Valley and the Loire alongside those from Burgundy and Bordeaux. ""All these wines were served at the table of the President of the Republic, and some of them have accompanied important moments in the history of the Fifth Republic,"" said Drouot. The Fifth Republic was established in 1958 and continues to this day, under President François Hollande. Elected last year, he has sought to boost tax revenues from the wealthy to try to cut France's large deficit. The history and associations of the Élysée wine may be expected to push prices up beyond what would be paid for similar bottles sold elsewhere. Chris Smith, investment manager at the Wine Investment Fund in London, told CNN the Élysée Palace auction would be likely to draw buyers who are attracted by the kudos of the wines' provenance rather than serious investors. The wines are mostly mature and ready to be drunk sooner rather than later, which makes them less of an investment buy, he said, although the 1990 Petrus is a very good wine. ""The wine is not especially rare or unusual -- they are the sort of wines that crop up at auction every now or then,"" he said. ""The fact that they are from the Élysée Palace gives them a certain sort of extra kudos that people may be prepared to pay a small premium for."" A recent sale from the cellars of the UK government saw just that effect, Smith said, with wines fetching more than might have been expected. This was in part because of their good provenance, he said, but also because they ""have that slight cachet that wines from the same stock that's been drunk by President Obama, or whoever's drunk the poshest wine from the cellars, have.""","1,200 bottles from the wine cellar of the Élysée Palace are being auctioned off .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Rapper Lil Wayne has been released from a Los Angeles hospital where he was taken after suffering a seizure last week, his publicist said late Monday night. The 30-year-old rapper's hospitalization at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center triggered media reports that he was near death -- rumors his associates were quick to squash. Few details about his medical condition were made public. On Monday night, Mack Maine, the president of Wayne's label, Young Money, thanked the hospital. ""@LilTunechi has been officially been released and is headed home...God is great,"" he tweeted. Lil Tunechi is Lil Wayne's nickname, as well as his Twitter handle. An online report that Lil Wayne was near death and on life support Friday cause panic among his fans and caused Twitter to light up with messages of concern. ""I'm good everybody,"" the rapper tweeted Friday evening, helping defuse the concerns. ""Thnx for the prayers and love."" Young Money publicist Sarah Cunningham acknowledged Friday that Lil Wayne had had a seizure, but members of the New Orleans artist's camp have shot down reports that he was near death. ""Dont believe the nonsense about comas and tubes to breathe ... that's false!!"" Maine tweeted Friday night. Instead of ighting for his life, Lil Wayne was watching the Syracuse University Orange play the Georgetown Hoyas in the Big East men's basketball tournament, he said. Born Dwayne Carter, Lil Wayne is one of the rap world's most successful artists. He won best rap album for ""Tha Carter III"" at the 2008 Grammy awards and took home three more Grammys the next year. Beyond winning over critics, he's also been a commercial success. In September, Billboard reported the rapper had tallied 109 hits on its Hot 100, surpassing the record previously held by Elvis Presley. But he's also run into trouble outside the studio and off stage. Lil Wayne was arrested in 2007 outside New York City's Beacon Theater after police said they found a .40-caliber pistol on his tour bus. He pleaded guilty to felony gun charges and spent eight months at New York's Rikers Island jail.

"(CNN) -- I've always lived in a world of letters and alphabets. One of my earliest recollections is memorizing every line and curve of the ABC's on a baby blanket my grandparents gave me. I learned to read at an early age, but my favorite books were dictionaries. I wanted no plot, no narrative, just the onrush of one word after another. This obsessive attention to letters and orthography led me to victory at the 1986 National Spelling Bee. My winning word: odontalgia, which means toothache. Winning the Bee can lead to all kinds of aches -- headaches, stomachaches, growing pains. But it can also be the time of a young kid's life. If you were to ask me whether the National Spelling Bee leads to obsessive levels of competition, I would say ""absolutely."" But that's not necessarily a bad thing. The same obsessions that lead a child to win a spelling bee are not much different from the obsessions that might someday lead a scientist to the cure for cancer. The agony and ecstasy of the National Spelling Bee . What is great about the National Spelling Bee is that it provides a safe space for prepubescent kids to meet peers with a similar obsession for words. When I was in junior high, public schools tolerated a much higher background level of bullying than they do in the post-Columbine era, but when I was at the Spelling Bee, I fit in. Yes, I won the championship, and I am always grateful for that, but ironically, the downside to being champion is that it gives you a lot less time to socialize with your fellow word nerds. People ask me what it was like to win the National Spelling Bee, but I mostly remember the lights and flashbulbs of the press that followed my victory. They were so blindingly bright to me I eventually borrowed my mother's tinted sunglasses to cut down on the glare. I was flown from Washington to New York to appear on ""Good Morning America,"" then flown back almost as quickly to shake hands with President Ronald Reagan in the White House Rose Garden. Then it was on to ""The Tonight Show"" with Johnny Carson. (For those of you younger folk, Johnny Carson is the late night TV guy before the other late night TV guy before Jimmy Fallon.) Carson was extremely personable to me and seemed to prefer hosting ""ordinary"" guests like a spelling bee winner or some farmer who won a Guinness World Record for growing the world's largest pumpkin instead of going through yet another interview with a movie star trying to plug his or her latest film. National Spelling Bee Fast Facts . After appearing on ""The Tonight Show,"" I talked less and less about winning the National Spelling Bee. I would occasionally get ribbed for it at school (or asked to spell an off-color word or two), but generally, it was less of a bother to let it fade into the background. I barely told anybody about it in college. In fact, a schoolmate only found out after finding my name listed as a spelling bee champion in an old copy of the World Almanac. When I watch the telecasts of the National Spelling Bee today, I'm impressed at the increasing level of competition that the kids bring to the bee each year. I won the over 25 years ago, but today, I'm not sure I could break out of the top 50. One of these days, a kid will memorize every single word in Webster's Third New International, and the judges may be forced to coin new words on the spot to declare a champion. Until then, I'm not only astounded by the quality of competition, but also uplifted by the spirit of fair play and mutual support that the spellers display to each other. Tonight one competitor will be crowned the 2013 National Spelling Bee victor and embark on a similar journey to the one I did 27 years ago. If I could impart any wisdom to the winner, it would be this: Life doesn't begin or end with the spelling bee. It just gives you some wonderful tales to tell along the way. Were you a bee kid? How far did you go? Share your story in the comments below.","Jon Pennington won the National Spelling Bee in 1986 .

"Nogales, Mexico (CNN) -- In the push to free an American woman from a Mexican prison, a video shown in court Thursday could be key. The security camera footage shows Yanira Maldonado and her husband boarding a bus in Mexico last week. They are carrying a purse, two blankets and two bottles of water. It's an everyday scene that plays out at bus stations around the world. But in this case, defense attorney Francisco Benitez argues that the images are a crucial piece of evidence. Why? Because nothing they're carrying, he argues, could hold the amount of marijuana that Yanira Maldonado is accused of smuggling. Maldonado, a Mormon mother of seven, has been in a Mexican jail for more than a week. Authorities accuse her of trying to smuggle 12 pounds of marijuana under a bus seat. She has maintained her innocence, and the case has drawn widespread media coverage and attention from U.S. lawmakers as family members push for her freedom. The revelation of the video comes at a key juncture in the case. A Mexican judge must decide by Friday whether there's enough evidence to charge Maldonado with drug trafficking. If she's not charged, Maldonado must be released, Benitez said. The video footage shown in court Thursday suggests that someone else brought the marijuana aboard the bus, the lawyer said. The packages of marijuana allegedly recovered from under Maldonado's seat would not have fit in her purse, Benitez said. Maldonado's attorneys also presented documents that show that she and her husband, Gary, have no criminal records in the United States, Benitez said. Word that the surveillance video had been shown in court was a big relief, Gary Maldonado told reporters Thursday night. ""That was the key that would help us prove her innocence,"" he said. Prosecutors' efforts to say the drugs could be hidden inside the blankets won't win the day, he said. ""It showed right on the film clear as day there's no way you could carry 12 pounds or 5.7 kilos with one arm. You could see me fold the blankets curled up,"" he said. The Mexican military officials who arrested Maldonado haven't made their case yet in court. The soldiers were scheduled to appear Wednesday but didn't show. Maldonado's family denies the charges and are optimistic the case against her is crumbling. Mexican authorities arrested Maldonado on May 22 as she and her husband were on their way back to Arizona. Gary Maldonado said he believes Mexican soldiers at the checkpoint wanted a bribe. A Mexican state official also told CNN it appears that Maldonado was framed. A regional office of Mexico's defense ministry said troops conducting a routine investigation stopped the bus Maldonado was riding in and found 12.5 pounds (5.7 kilograms) of a substance that appeared to be marijuana under her seat. Troops turned the case over to the Mexican attorney general's office, the defense ministry said. Maldonado is being housed in a women's prison in Nogales while authorities decide her fate. In an interview Wednesday with CNN, Maldonado said she has been turning to Scripture to survive the ordeal. ""Reading the Scriptures, reading the Book of Mormon, praying, fasting,"" Maldonado said. ""And all the support that I've been getting from my family, my husband, my children and everybody out there reaching out to help."" Family members' tearful pleas for her release have drawn widespread media attention to the case and caught the attention of U.S. officials. ""I am watching this very, very closely,"" said Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Arizona. ""After the hearing tomorrow, if I have concerns, I may end up having to go to Mexico myself and get involved in this thing personally."" Salmon said he's spoken about the case with the U.S. ambassador to Mexico and Mexico's ambassador in Washington. ""This case gets stranger by the minute,"" Salmon said, ""and I think most Americans as they've been watching it unfold have a lot of concerns."" Salmon said witnesses' testimony that Maldonado was only carrying a purse when she got on the bus is among the details that caught his attention. ""What concerns me more than anything is that I want to make sure justice is met. I want to make sure that she is treated with every courtesy and fairness that we would expect in our own judicial system,"" he said. State Department officials said consular officials met with Maldonado Wednesday and last Friday, and are in regular contact by phone. U.S. diplomats are doing the same things they usually would when a U.S. citizen is arrested in a foreign country, but maybe to a higher degree because of the high-profile nature of the case, a senior administration official said. On Thursday night, Gary Maldonado said his wife was in good spirits. ""She was in a good mood,"" he said. ""She feels like she was going to get out, since we have the evidence that proves her innocence."" CNN's Christine Theodorou, Casey Wian, Elise Labott and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: Yanira Maldonado's husband says the video evidence is ""clear as day""

"(CNN) -- It was a rare occurrence: ninth-graders in Matthew French's health class giving something their full attention. The students, at Los Angeles' Miguel Contreras Learning Complex, sat at their desks watching a video. They were about to learn the sexually transmitted disease status of a California beauty queen. The teenagers laughed as the video instructed them to turn their attention to their cell phones, French recalls -- normally, it was a constant battle to get them to put the phones away. Then the video had them text a code to Qpid.me, a website that allows kids as young as 13 to find an STD clinic, get tested and have their results sent to them via text message. Moments later, the teens got a text revealing that Miss California 2009, Tami Farrell, was negative for HIV, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Farrell is the celebrity face of Qpid.me's new STD awareness campaign. If it's cool for a beauty queen to share her STD status, then maybe kids will start to think it's cool to share their own results. Site founder Ramin Bastani is banking on it. ""We want to normalize the idea of sharing your status,"" Bastani says. High-tech tools to fight STDs . A text message revealing a teenager's positive or negative STD status may well be the latest tool -- albeit a controversial one -- to target the spread of disease among students. This past fall, Qpid.me partnered with the Los Angeles Unified School District -- the second largest school system in the country, with more than 660,000 K-12 students -- to teach students as young as seventh grade how to get their STD results, show them to potential partners, and then request to see their potential partners' results before they hook up or have sex. Sexual activity among students has long been a concern for the district. In 2005, the Los Angeles County Health Department surveyed more than 4,000 middle-schoolers in 14 area public schools. The research showed 16% of seventh-graders had engaged in oral sex and 20% of eighth-graders had had intercourse. A 2011 national school-based survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Los Angeles schools found 39% of high schoolers were having sex. The district turned to Qpid.me to try a new approach to get students tested and reduce infections. So far, 200,000 ninth- through 12th-graders and 120,000 seventh- and eighth-graders have learned about the free service in fall and spring semester health classes, according to Tim Kordic, the district's HIV/AIDS prevention program manager. ""We don't suspect that most seventh-graders are going to go out and use this. We do suspect that in high school they will,"" Kordic says. Critics of the partnership, however, say Qpid.me comes too close to condoning underage sex and gives an incomplete picture of someone's STD status by excluding certain infections, like HPV and herpes. ""While we absolutely encourage sexually active teens to be tested for STDs, the underlying message of the Qpid.me campaign is troublesome,"" says Valerie Huber, president and CEO of the National Abstinence Education Association, a group that ""exists to serve, support and represent individuals and organizations in the practice of abstinence education,"" according to its website. ""It provides tacit endorsement of teen sexual activity, sending the message to teens as young as 13 that sexual experimentation is expected and risk-free as long as they are tested for STDs and use a condom,"" Huber says in a statement. The Los Angeles school district disagrees. ""We're not using this as a lure for kids to say, 'OK, you can have sex because you did this,'"" Kordic says. ""What we felt was that if the kids had the information that they would make better decisions about their sexual partners."" FDA approves morning-after pill without prescription for girls 15 and older . In 2011, Los Angeles-area youths between 13 and 19 contracted 25% of chlamydia cases and 16% of gonorrhea cases, according to the Los Angeles County Health Department. People under 18 made up 24.1% of the county's population in 2011, according to the U.S. Census. ""So many kids are walking around with STDs and they don't even know it,"" Kordic says. ""We definitely have an epidemic going on."" By law, children as young as 12 in California can get tested for STDs without a parent's consent. The district offers testing on some of its campuses, but stigma and logistical challenges, like access to a car, can keep students out of clinics. Qpid.me requires an STD test. If it catches on and students start demanding to see their partner's verified STD status, sex educators hope it will give teens an incentive to get tested if they want to have sex. ""One of the things we're saying is this will make you more attractive to other students potentially,"" Bastani says. ""Then the pressure is on the person who doesn't have it,"" adds French, whose own students were split on whether they would actually use Qpid.me. ""We had many people saying, 'Oh, this program is dope. This is cool,'"" says 14-year-old student Geo Morataya. ""And we had other people going like, 'I really don't agree with this program.'"" Morataya says he's not sexually active yet, but some of his friends are. He told his mom about Qpid.me when he got home from school. ""She was cool letting me use stuff like this to help keep me in check -- but as long as I stay safe,"" he says. ""As long as I don't not use protection."" Critics also question whether students would be organized enough to get themselves to clinics or be mature enough to actually use the information before having sex. ""I'm skeptical how often somebody will say, 'Hey, if you don't tell me your test results then we're not doing it,'"" says Peter Sprigg, a senior fellow for policy studies at the Family Research Council. ""To expect a 13-year-old, or a 15- or 17-year-old for that matter, to able to act in such a rational manner while they're in the grip of these irrational passions is very naive and unrealistic."" Even more progressive institutions, like Planned Parenthood, express caution. ""While we value the use of innovative tools to improve sexual health, the most powerful message we can deliver to prevent infections is to always use a condom every time you have sex,"" says Leslie Kantor, Planned Parenthood's vice president of education. Free condoms for your 12-year-old? California health council can help . The district says it recognizes parents may be uncomfortable with their children using technology to text and share their STD status, but notes its tech-savvy students have a different perspective. ""This is how they receive information now. This is where they go to -- their phones -- and so for them to receive it that way isn't abnormal. It's normal,"" Kordic says. ""What we're doing basically as adults is we're entering their world, which we're always trying to do. We're always trying to figure out how do we speak their language -- use our tools, but bridge that with what they're doing now."" French, who's already taught Qpid.me to about 120 students, says he did it to protect them. ""It's just shown to them as a tool, just like a condom is a tool to prevent an STD,"" he says. ""If students aren't getting tested or aren't talking to their partners about STD status, then knowing what gonorrhea is is kind of irrelevant."" The district says it's too soon to know how many students are using Qpid.me. In the future, Bastani says he'd like the service to be an educational tool used across the country. ""We'll have the best information anywhere in the country for where students -- and anyone who wants to get tested for STDs -- can go,"" he says. ""Sometimes kids are going to forget to use condoms, sometimes they're not going to share their status, but if there's a resource for them to do so, I think it empowers a lot of them who are really concerned about this.""","Qpid.me, a site that allows users to share STD status, partners with Los Angeles schools .

"(CNN) -- Can you imagine a world where the sun never sets? For scientists cruising Antarctica in a mammoth 94-meter ship, that's exactly the surreal realm they encountered. Now their remarkable two-month expedition has been condensed into a haunting time-lapse video, following the floating laboratory as it plowed its way through some of the most brutal conditions on the planet. ""We arrived in summer, mid-February, when there was 24-hour sunlight,"" Stanford University Ph.D student, Cassandra Brooks, told CNN. ""The sun would move from high in the sky to very low, but would never completely disappear. I didn't get tired until 1.am -- it was very energizing."" 'Touching infinity' Brooks, who is studying international ocean policy, was one of 30 U.S. scientists monitoring Antarctica's unique eco-system, as part of a National Science Foundation research cruise. The ship wound its way along the stunning Ross Sea -- believed to be the last untouched marine eco-system on the planet -- providing scientists with an important insight into one of our few remaining healthy waterways. During the summer months, Antarctica -- the southern most tip of the globe -- is transformed into a bewitching ""Land of the Midnight Sun,"" where the sun never dips below the horizon, instead continuously moving in circles. After more than a week of this extraordinary phenomenon, the team finally saw their first sunset at 1.am -- an experience Brooks described as ""like touching infinity."" ""Brilliant orange light streamed through the portholes on the starboard side of the ship. I peeled myself away from my microscope, dashed across the room and peered outside to catch the sun blazing down on the horizon,"" the 33-year-old said. ""The sight took my breath away -- the sky was on fire, turning the ocean a deep purple red. Gusts of wind collided with the wide rolling swells, driving an arc of brilliant pink spray 10 feet into the air."" Life and death . Despite the breathtaking beauty of this icy underworld, conditions could also be brutal with winds of 110 kilometers per hour and temperatures plunging to -40C. On these extreme days, scientists weren't allowed outside on the deck covered in a slippery -- and dangerous --layer of ice. ""If you fell overboard you'd be dead within minutes because the water is below freezing,"" said Brooks. ""Yet it's an environment that's also teeming with animals such as emperor penguins and Weddell seals."" Sometimes tightly packed ice up to 10 ft deep threatened to trap the ship -- Brooks admitted on previous expeditions it had been stuck for weeks -- and it was forced to spend hours reversing and ramming its way through. The adventure was caught on film after Brooks attached a video camera to the bow of the boat -- capturing everything from blazing sunshine to fierce storms. 'Forget Friday night' For more than two months, the team cruised Antarctica's wild Ross Sea -- more than 5,000 kilometers from the closest country; New Zealand. Their ship, the Nathaniel B Palmer, became a floating island in itself, equipped with a helicopter hanger, gym, industrial kitchen, library, conference room and laboratory. Brooks was part of a team measuring plankton in the water and would usually start her experiments at 7.am, working until 8.pm. During the summer months, Antarctica's green plankton bloom grows so large it can be seen from outer space. ""We were there to test what happens to all that phytoplankton, which provides a vital source of carbon -- or food -- to the system,"" Brooks explained. ""Does it sink out to the bottom? Get eaten over the summer? Does it get transported out of the system? Many think that this large source of phytoplankton is the reason why the Ross Sea has such large populations of predators. ""Some people would still be up sampling water until 4.am,"" she added. ""The idea of weekends and normal Friday nights completely disappears."" Spiritual science . For Brooks, the journey was more than just a science expedition -- it was a spiritual experience which gave her a renewed appreciation for mighty mother nature. ""It just grabbed me in a very visceral way,"" said Brooks. ""It's such an obviously beautiful place but also surreal -- the conditions are so extreme so you're seeing a whole other world you've never seen before."" Many scientists now believe the Ross Sea is the last untouched marine ecosystem in the world. If Brooks' stunning video is anything to go by, it's also one worth protecting.","Science research ship cruises Antarctica, captures stunning time-lapse video .

"Peshawar, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban will avenge the group's No. 2 leader, who was slain Wednesday in a drone strike, and won't listen to government peace initiatives, a spokesman said Thursday. Ehsanullah Ehsan, the group's spokesman, told CNN the group holds the Pakistani government responsible for the death of Wali-Ur Rehman Mehsud. Rehman is one of seven people slain when a drone struck a target near the town of Miranshah, according to a local official and an intelligence official. The target is in the North Waziristan district of Pakistan's tribal region -- a rugged area with a significant population of militant groups. The Pakistani Taliban will not accept any offer from the government for a peace dialogue, Ehsan said. Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani politician who is expected to serve as the next prime minister, has broached the issue of engaging in peace talks with the Pakistani Taliban. Militants in the tribal region, including the Pakistani Taliban, long have been conducting an insurgency against the Pakistani government. Rehman -- now buried in a secret North Waziristan location, Ehsan said -- was wanted by the United States on suspicion of being involved in the December 2009 suicide bomb attack that killed seven CIA employees at Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost, Afghanistan, according to a publication by the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center. The publication, which described him as the Pakistan Taliban's No. 2 leader and chief military strategist, and said he participated in cross-border attacks in Afghanistan against U.S. and NATO personnel. He was second in command to Hakimullah Mehsud. Rehman was killed along with his close aide, Fakhar-ul-Islam, and two Uzbek nationals whose identities the sources didn't know. The United States has long conducted drone strikes in its fight against suspected Taliban and Pakistani jihadist groups in Pakistan near the Afghan border. Before this week, the last reported drone strike in Pakistan was in mid-April. The latest strike was the first known hit since Pakistan held general elections on May 11 and since U.S. President Barack Obama announced his new counterterrorism policy last week. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Wednesday that he couldn't confirm reports of Rehman's death, but he said the militant was wanted for the Khost incident and mentioned his participation in attacks. ""It's important to note who this individual is,"" he said. Drone strikes have become controversial and unpopular because they have killed civilians, and Pakistan has said it has ""serious concerns"" over the latest attack. Pakistan, which describes itself as a front-line state in the fight against terrorism, said it has ""consistently maintained that the drone strikes are counterproductive, entail loss of innocent civilian lives, have human rights and humanitarian implications and violate the principles of national sovereignty, territorial integrity and international law."" When Obama discussed drone strikes last week in his counterterrorism address, he said they must be used with more temperance and caution. But, he said, they remain a necessary tool to take on terrorists. CNN's Zahir Shah Sherazi reported from Peshawar and Joe Sterling wrote and reported in Atlanta.","Pakistani Taliban says it will reject any peace initiatives .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday night, Blake Shelton brought together an all-star lineup for a benefit concert to help those in Oklahoma recover from last week's devastating tornado. The event, called ""Healing in the Heartland,"" was held in front of a sold-out crowd at Oklahoma City's Chesapeake Energy Arena, and broadcast on NBC. Shelton, a coach on the network's singing competition ""The Voice,"" tapped fellow Okies Vince Gill, Reba McEntire and Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic to perform alongside Usher, Luke Bryan, Darius Rucker, Rascal Flatts and Shelton's wife, Miranda Lambert. Lambert gave a particularly emotional performance during the telethon, as she choked up in the middle of her song, ""The House That Built Me."" The lauded country artist made it about halfway through before tears overtook her ability to sing, and the audience cheered their support and stepped in to carry the song until Lambert could continue. Her husband joined his fellow ""The Voice"" coach Usher to close out the show with another poignant performance, this time of Michael BublÃ©'s ""Home."" ""I'm here tonight with some of my closest friends from Oklahoma and beyond to join in and help with the rebuilding and recovery of this land that means so much to me,"" Shelton said during the concert, which carried on in the midst of another severe weather threat. Vince Gill, for one, wasn't going to let that stop him from his mission of uplift. ""I told somebody tonight, I said, 'Well, if another one comes and they tear some more stuff down, we'll help 'em build that back up, too!'"" the country singer said with a laugh. Gill is from the area, having grown up roughly 10 miles north of where a monstrous tornado ripped through Moore, Oklahoma, on May 20, leaving 24 dead, including nine children. ""Your heart hurts for those people and those kids who got killed. ... It rips your guts out every time,"" Gill said. ""They're struggling and they've lost everything they have, a lot of people. Their homes, their possessions, their pictures and their whole history is gone in a flash. You can't do anything but reach out and say, 'We're here.' "" Money raised during the telethon is going to the United Way of Central Oklahoma's relief fund. If there's a silver lining to be found, Gill said, it is in the humanity seen during a crisis. ""When times are tough like this, people step up and help each other. It's a human element and a human touch and it's awesome to see that,"" he said. OneRepublic's Tedder, who grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said he hopes those who watched the show ""will take away just the overwhelming sense of pride in the state of Oklahoma, and the people. I mean, these are the nicest people on Earth,"" he told CNN. ""I've lived all over the country now, and the one consistent thing that every different state says about Oklahoma is, 'Yeah, I went there once. I drove to Tulsa, I went here, I stayed there. Nicest people I've ever met, they'd give you the shirt of their back.' And that is the nature of Oklahomans. ... And I think the whole country sees it.""

"(CNN) -- Two women died Saturday -- one of them after being swept away moments after being inches from her would-be rescuers -- due to raging floodwaters in San Antonio, which braced for yet more drenching rains. At one point Saturday, a storm and subsequent floods had knocked out power to about 12,000 customers and spurred the closure of dozens of streets in the Texas city and the surrounding county, authorities said. Scores of people had to be evacuated due to floods and other issues, and Fire Chief Charles Hood noted there had been about 250 water-related calls -- in addition to ones for things like medical emergencies, accidents and more -- in the first 15 hours of Saturday. The greatest concern had to do with people getting too close to fast-moving, deceptive and unpredictable floodwaters. ""We're asking folks to observe low-water crossing (warnings), to use common sense and to stay off the road if possible,"" Mayor Julian Castro said. The first confirmed fatality -- a woman around age 30 -- was reported around 7:30 a.m. (8:30 a.m. ET), and her body was about three hours later, police Chief William McManus said. Some time later, an older female driver went into water that was 4 feet above flood markers. Firefighters got to her vehicle and broke a window -- with one firefighter cutting his hand -- Hood explained. Then, as the would-be rescuers tried to get her from her vehicle, ""the currents changed and washed that vehicle away,"" the fire chief said. The woman's car had rolled on top of rescue boat, forcing out the firefighters who'd been in it, fire department spokesman Christian Bove later explained. By the time the firefighters were able to climb back into the boat, her car had become submerged in about 25-foot deep water and was gone. Hood characterized authorities' subsequent efforts to find this woman as ""a body recovery."" Described as being in her late 60s, the victim was found dead inside her vehicle around 6:45 p.m., Bove said. ""You can imagine how emotionally spent you are to try to rescue somebody, you're face-to-face with them, and then they're washed away,"" Hood said of his distraught firefighters, who'd gotten so close to rescuing the woman only to lose her. The chief warned more people may be missing and perhaps dead. Firefighters happened to spot this woman going into the water before they rushed to rescue her; there may be others, Hood pointed out, who firefighters or others don't see get trapped in floodwaters. ""Turn around and don't drown,"" multiple officials repeated at a Saturday news conference. The problems began with torrential rains late Friday that continued into Saturday, triggering flash-flood warnings across South Texas. The weather was windy and wet and included a reported tornado on Friday in Bexar, just west of San Antonio, that knocked down trees and power lines and caused ""minor building damage,"" according to the National Weather Service. San Antonio International Airport received 9.57 inches of rain Saturday morning alone, CNN meteorologists said. The city's Leon Creek was at 27.1 feet at 2:16 p.m. Saturday -- well above the flood stage of 15 feet. ""Disastrous flooding puts near 7 feet of flow in buildings in the jet engine test facility at Kelly AFB,"" the National Weather Service said. ""Secondary and primary roads and bridges are severely flooded and dangerous to motorists above Highway 90 to below (Interstate 35)"" Flood warnings have also been issued for the San Antonio River, Medina River and Salado Creek, all of which are above flood stage. The weather service forecast that storms ""could produce heavy rainfall"" sometime after . In an interview with CNN affiliate KENS, San Antonio resident Mary Alice Galicia described how water enveloped her house. ""It was underwater 20 minutes ago,"" she said earlier Saturday. ""I came over here. I own the property, and my daughter said that she couldn't get to her car. Her car's all flooded. The property -- the water's all swarming through the whole house. I just came over to check to see what I could do, but there's nothing that I can do right now."" Galicia doesn't have flood insurance because she ""never imagined this would happen,"" she said. ""But it's not stopping. I thought it was gonna stop,"" she said about the water damage. San Antonio's previous record flooding in 1998 was devastating, caused by heavy rains throughout south Texas and by a plume of moist air from Hurricane Madeline off the Mexican west coast. A total of 11 people died in San Antonio that weekend, with property damage estimates at $750 million, a city report said. In all, the south Texas flooding killed 31 people during that October 1998 weekend: 26 drownings, two tornado deaths, two heart attacks and one electrocution-drowning, a federal report said. At least 17 of the drowning victims were in vehicles driving into the water or swept away by rising water, the U.S. Commerce Department report said. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo, Michael Martinez and Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","NEW: A woman swept away as firefighters tried to rescue her is found dead, spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Authorities are interviewing a person in Texas in connection with threatening letters sent to President Barack Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg that are being tested for ricin, a person with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Thursday. Officials on Wednesday intercepted a letter addressed to the president that was similar to letters sent to Bloomberg and a gun-control group he founded. The off-site facility that screens mail addressed to the White House turned the letter over to the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force for testing and investigation, U.S. Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary said Thursday. The letter was addressed to Obama, the Secret Service said. The letters sent to Bloomberg and his group are suspected of containing a deadly toxin. Preliminary tests indicate ricin was found in the letters, New York Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said Wednesday. ""You will have to kill me and my family before you get my guns,"" the letters said, a law enforcement official told CNN. ""Anyone wants to come to my house will be shot in the face. The right to bear arms is my constitutional God-given right and I will exercise that right 'til the day I die. What's in this letter is nothing compared to what I've got planned for you,"" the note inside each envelope said, according to the official. A memo the mayor's office sent to employees Thursday said the envelope sent to Bloomberg ""contained a small amount of ricin,"" which ""did not appear to be in a form that could be inhaled or otherwise readily ingested. Touching the envelope or letter should not be a risk."" If inhaled, injected or ingested, less than a pinpoint of ricin can kill a person in 36 to 48 hours by causing failure of the respiratory and circulatory systems. There is no known antidote for the toxin, which is derived from castor beans. What is ricin? Officials have not said whether any such substance was found in the letter sent to the White House. The law enforcement official did not know the status of testing on anything found in the letter and did not disclose whether there was a message. But the source said the letter appears similar to the notes sent to Bloomberg and Mayors Against Illegal Guns. The letter sent to Obama was postmarked in Shreveport, Louisiana, the official said -- just like the letters to Bloomberg and his group, the law enforcement source said. The person who wrote the letters to Bloomberg and his group threatened anyone who tried to seize the writer's guns would be ""shot in the face,"" a source with knowledge of the letters said Thursday. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said: ""We are assuming that the letters are ... from the same machine or the same computer."" He said there was no signature on the letter sent to New York. That letter was opened at the city government's mail facility, in a biochemical containment box. The employee who handled the letter has no symptoms of illness, and there's no reason to believe any employees are at risk from being in the building where it was delivered, the mayor's office memo said Thursday. Bloomberg met with employees at the facility Thursday and ""thanked them for their dedication,"" his office said. The letter to the mayor's organization was opened by Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, in Washington on Sunday. Glaze is doing fine, a spokeswoman for the group said Thursday. Opinion: Ricin, almost never deadly . Suspected ricin has been included in letters in the past few months sent to Obama and other officials. In April, letters were sent to Obama; Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi; and Sadie Holland, a judge in Lee County, Mississippi. James Everett Dutschke of Tupelo, Mississippi, has been charged with possession and use of a biological agent in connection with that case. There haven't been any more ricin-type suspicious letters to lawmakers since the mailing to Wicker, Capitol Police in Washington said. In addition, a reminder was recently sent to lawmakers urging them to be careful at home and in their state offices. The new letter to Obama is not believed to be related to the Mississippi case, the law enforcement official said. Man, 37, arrested in probe of ricin-laced letters in Washington state .

"Moscow (CNN) -- If a country's standing can be measured by its sporting ambitions, then Russia's status as a superpower is once again on the rise. Its big-spending football league is attracting top international stars, and the next few years will see it host major sporting spectacles for the first time since the Soviet-era regime staged the 1980 Olympic Games that were notoriously boycotted by the United States. And ahead of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and the 2018 soccer World Cup, one of Russia's prominent athletes has put aside her sporting dreams to concentrate on contributing to the politics of the Kremlin. Anna Chakvetadze was one of Russia's seemingly never ending line of top female tennis players when she burst onto the scene as a 17-year-old in 2004. A junior finalist at Wimbledon the previous year, she stunned compatriot and world No. 3 Anastasia Myskina at the U.S. Open and went on to reach a career-high fifth in the rankings, winning eight tournaments and almost $4 million on the WTA Tour. However, she has now turned to politics after sliding outside the top 150 following a combination of injuries and illness. ""I would like to develop youth sport. I was a sportsman myself so I know about problems in sport,"" the 24-year-old told CNN. ""I would like youth sport in our country to be affordable to people from all social classes. We have to give the same access to sport for kids from poor families. Ideally, my goal is to get the majority involved in sport activities ... sport should come to every family."" Chakvetadze has chosen the fringe ""Right Cause Party"" as she stands for Russia's lower parliament in the December 4 elections, with parties needing 7% of the total vote to earn seats. Former top-ranked men's tennis player Marat Safin will also be standing, seeking one of 450 places. And they'll both be hoping to join fellow sports figures Svetlana Khorkina and Alina Kabaeva in the State Duma after the two former Olympic champion gymnasts won respective elections in 2007 . Formed in 2008 from the ashes of three other parties, Right Cause has positioned itself as ""anti-old guard"" and dismissed the relevancy of former president Vladimir Putin and other longtime political stalwarts who have stood for decades. ""It's a challenge for me. I have joined Right Cause because it's a young party with fresh ideas,"" Chakvetadze said. ""I was invited to join it when (Mikhail) Prokhorov was in it. But even now all the basic ideas that the Right Cause stands for haven't changed and I share the program and idea of the party."" Billionaire businessman Prokhorov stepped down in September after a few months as party leader, dismissing Right Cause as a ""puppet party"" of the Kremlin. It is an accusation Luke Harding -- a reporter for British newspaper The Guardian and the first Western journalist to be expelled from Russia since the end of the Cold War in 2011 -- supports. ""Russia was a quasi-democracy under Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s. But over the last decade-plus under Putin there has been a restoration of the classic authoritarian model, with the squashing of independent TV, proper elections, and opposition forces,"" Harding, the author of ""Mafia State: How one reporter became the enemy of a brutal new Russia,"" told CNN. ""Today's Russia does have political 'parties,' like Right Cause. But they are not parties in the real sense -- their role is simply decorative, to create the illusion of voter choice and to legitimize decisions taken behind closed doors in the Kremlin. ""There's a long tradition in Russia of getting sportsmen and women to stand for parties: they help to enthuse a weary and cynical electorate."" Prime Minister Putin has announced that next year he intends to again stand for president, a position he held for two consecutive terms -- the maximum allowed -- before endorsing the campaign of his 2008 successor Dmitry Medvedev. While her fellow Right Cause candidate Andrei Bogdanov has listed Putin among the Russian establishment ""we have had enough of,"" Chakvetadze said the 59-year-old -- who is a strong supporter of sport -- is popular with the people. ""The real opposition is a constructive one that has something to offer to authorities [other than] beautiful election campaign slogans. I guess the Right Cause is able to become a constructive opponent,"" she said. ""As for the next president, Putin is really significantly supported by Russians. If he is elected he will take the real steps for further development of the state and improving lifestyle for citizens, which is a good thing. The main thing is to keep on moving."" Chakvetadze said sport is an important part of becoming a healthy nation, and acknowledged that improvements need to be made before the big events in 2014 and 2018. ""First we should develop the infrastructure -- build new stadiums, hotels, additional railway service and air travel,"" she said. ""We have to provide our guests and citizens with the highest level of security service. We must not lose face. Big sport forums like this will definitely increase interest in sport and will contribute to the promotion of healthy lifestyles. ""On the other hand it will make our authorities move and develop the infrastructure of territories where these competitions will take place, attract new investment into our country."" Chakvetadze has struggled to maintain the peak levels of 2007, when she reached the U.S. Open semifinals and was also part of Russia's successful Fed Cup team, but she has not closed the door on her tennis career. ""This year was really a tough one for me. There were several traumas and I decided to take care and restore my health,"" she said. ""It doesn't mean that I'm over with my sport career. I just took a pause for an unknown period of time. So all my goals now are related with this party project.""","Russian tennis player Anna Chakvetadze is standing for Russian parliament .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Famed Indian spiritual guru Sri Sathya Sai Baba died Sunday of respiratory failure, his doctors said. He was 85. The orange-robed spiritual leader with a puff of dark hair is considered a living god by his followers in India and overseas. His followers believe he has supernatural powers. However, critics have accused him of fraud and sexual abuse, allegations he has denied. The guru claimed to be a reincarnation of Sai Baba of Shirdi, one of India's greatest spiritual figures, who died in 1918. Sri Sathya Sai Baba was hospitalized last month in his southern India hometown of n Puttaparthi. Authorities have tightened security around the town since his condition started worsening. In a hospital bulletin, doctors did not use the word death to announce his passing. It said he was ""no more with us physically"" and that he left ""his earthly body"" on Sunday. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed his condolences and said the nation mourns his passing. He inspired millions to lead a meaningful life regardless of their religions, the prime minister said. ""His teachings were rooted in the universal ideals of truth, right conduct, peace, love and nonviolence,"" he said. ""I express my sincere condolences to the millions of his followers, disciples and well wishers."" The guru has set up various health, education and charity organizations. His body will lie in state for two days so his followers can pay their respects, according to the hospital, which is funded by his organization.","The spiritual leader dies after cardio-respiratory failure .

"(CNN) -- On the first day of every year, works of art whose term of copyright has expired enters the public domain. This year's class is particularly strong, as the novels of James Joyce and Virginia Woolf are now free of copyright protection. If you ever wanted to stage a puppet show of Joyce's masterpiece ""Ulysses"" or set Woolf's ""Mrs. Dalloway"" to music, now is your chance. But why now? When copyright expires, it means that the public is not liable for using works of art in ways that would otherwise violate the copyright law. Dover can publish scores of classical music at low prices; translations of literature can be commissioned; authors, artists and motion picture companies can adapt older works and make them into new works. A number of Disney classics are, in fact, based on public domain works. How long copyright should last has been a contentious issue since the first copyright act of 1790. In some industries, copyright laws are necessary to provide financial protection for the time and investment that goes into creating works of art. But when the length of copyright is so long that it hinders creative repurposing of older work, then copyright's purpose isn't being served. Our original copyright act in 1790 protected only books, maps and charts. Over time, the law expanded to include fine art and photographs, among other things. Currently, a blockbuster film such as ""Avatar"" gets the same protection as an e-mail you dash off to your friends. To understand how copyright law has changed in the United States over the past 30 years, it's helpful to take a look at Duke University's Center for the Public Domain's list of famous works that would have gone into the public domain if it weren't for the changes in copyright law. This year, it would include Vladimir Nabokov's ""Lolita,"" J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Return of the King"" and Disney's ""The Lady and the Tramp."" These famous works were originally covered by a law in 1909, which stipulated that copyright lasted for 28 years from first publication, with the possibility of another 28 years, but only if the copyright owner filed a renewal publication with the Copyright Office. Thousands of works were protected under this sensible system, and 85% of them entered the public domain after 28 years, making them available to artists and more accessible to consumers. But in 1978, Congress retroactively changed the rules, giving these works another 19 years at the end. If the artist renewed the copyright, he or she received 47 years rather than 28 years, for a maximum of 75 years. And then in 1998, Congress retroactively added another 20 years to these old art works, meaning they now have a protection up to a maximum of 95 years. For works created after 1978, the length of copyright is even longer: life of the author plus 70 years after the author's death. The effect of this dramatic lengthening of copyright has come at a large cost with little benefit: older works cannot be used productively by motion picture companies, authors and artists. Many owners of copyrighted works cannot even be located. And remote heirs, such as grandchildren and great-grandchildren or the estates of deceased authors, can veto uses that are economically harmless. For example, when I was in private practice at a large law firm, a partner asked me to approach the estate of a famous playwright. My colleague was hoping to get permission to produce an abridged version of a play at his son's special education school. The school was willing to pay the licensing fee, but the children were capable of only performing one act, not three. The production would be only before parents, not for any profit. After all this was explained to the estate, they subsequently refused permission and the money, insisting the children had to produce the play as written, or not at all. As we adapt to the digital age, arcane copyright laws that offer no benefit even to the current copyright holder must be reconsidered. A sensible approach would not act as an obstacle to future generations who want to create something new. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama is exploring executive orders to help prevent mass shootings in America, Vice President Joe Biden said Wednesday. ""The president is going to act. Executive orders, executive action, can be taken,"" Biden told reporters before meetings with groups representing survivors of mass shootings. ""We haven't decided what this is yet, but we're compiling it all with the help of the attorney general and all the rest of the Cabinet members."" Legislative action also is needed, Biden said. ""I'm convinced we can affect the well-being of millions of Americans, and take thousands of people out of harm's way, if we act responsibly,"" he said. President Obama vowed last month that a new task force overseen by Biden will provide ""concrete proposals"" by the end of January to reduce gun violence. The group, which includes an array of Cabinet members and government officials, was established in the wake of the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 27 people dead -- 20 of them elementary school children. In addition to gun laws, the group is looking at mental health care and what the president has described as a culture that often ""glorifies guns and violence."" CNN iReport: The gun control debate . Biden's brief remarks Wednesday came before what will likely be some of the most emotional testimony before the task force. Among those addressing the group to push for tougher gun laws is Colin Goddard of the Brady Campaign. He was shot four times in the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, in which a gunman killed 32 people and himself. ""My job is to represent the voice of the overwhelming majority of Americans ... that want some comprehensive, common sense changes to our gun policy,"" he told CNN Wednesday. ""There are common ground solutions that respect the Second Amendment."" Many gun sales take place without background checks, and ""that's bad policy,"" he argues. Conducting such checks ""doesn't stop a law-abiding citizen from getting a gun. But somebody with a history of illness, felony record, they need to get checked."" The campaign's phones have been ""ringing off the hook"" since the Newtown massacre, he said. The task force will also hear from gun safety organizations Wednesday. Where do you stand? Weigh in on Twitter . Gun lobby faces challenge . On Thursday, Biden's group will hear from the other side: gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association. The NRA has argued that it is committed to keeping people protected, but that a focus on stricter gun control is misguided. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre has called for all U.S. schools to have armed guards . NRA President David Keene later told CNN the group supports schools choosing whether they want armed guards. A rising chorus of voices is standing up against the NRA and the gun lobby's sway over U.S. politics. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, shot in the head in a mass shooting two years ago, and her husband Mark Kelly, a former Navy captain and astronaut, launched a new political action committee Tuesday to end what they called lawmakers' ""fear"" of the gun lobby. White House responds to petition to deport Piers Morgan . CNN's Piers Morgan has also garnered attention for speaking out against the influence of the gun lobby and pushing stricter gun control, which led more than 100,000 people to sign a petition on the White House website calling for him to be deported. ""Let's not let arguments over the Constitution's Second Amendment violate the spirit of its First,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney wrote in a response Wednesday. ""Americans may disagree on matters of public policy and express those disagreements vigorously, but no one should be punished by the government simply because he or she expressed a view on the Second Amendment -- or any other matter of public concern,"" Carney added. Carney's response did not mention Morgan by name. Wal-Mart changes tune, will attend White House meeting . The nation's largest retailer, meanwhile, made news for reversing a decision -- and saying it will participate in a White House meeting. Wal-Mart initially said scheduling conflicts would prevent its ""experts"" on gun control from attending. But on Wednesday it announced it will send representatives to the Thursday meeting. The company has had ""ongoing conversations with the administration, Congress, (New York) Mayor (Michael) Bloomberg's office, sportsmen groups, suppliers and others to listen and share our thoughts and experiences,"" company spokesman David Tovar said in a statement to CNN. ""Knowing our senior leaders could not be in Washington this week, we spoke in advance with the vice president's office to share our perspective,"" he said. ""We underestimated the expectation to attend the meeting on Thursday in person, so we are sending an appropriate representative to participate."" Wal-Mart sells guns and ammunition. The future of gun laws: Weigh in on Facebook . States, cities make their own moves . Across the country, people are sharing their views on what Washington should decide. Among them are Californians who have packed town hall meetings. Some have spoken out in support of renewing a ban on assault weapons -- high-capacity weapons that have been used in numerous mass shootings. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, is pushing to reinstate a ban that expired in 2004. But others at the town halls argue that banning those guns isn't the answer, and could even be a slippery slope toward banning all guns. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, in his annual State of the State address, said Wednesday his state must enact ""the toughest assault weapons ban in the nation, period."" ""Gun violence has been on a rampage as we know first hand and we know painfully. We must stop the madness, my friends,"" he said. ""It has been enough."" Bloomberg, a longtime advocate of stricter gun control, is pushing for tough steps nationwide. In Connecticut, Gov. Dannel Malloy choked up discussing the Newtown shooting, and said ""more guns are not the answer."" ""Freedom is not a handgun on the hip of every teacher and security should not mean a guard posted outside every classroom,"" he said Wednesday in the State of the State address. Burlington, Vermont, a city of less than 43,000 people, has already made a move of its own: passing a resolution that could lead to a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines. The city council voted 10-3 in favor of the resolution, which will now be presented in public hearings and voted on by the public before going to the state legislature. Amid the cacophony of voices battling over the issue, two young former Marines have found themselves in a spotlight online, representing very different views. First, Joshua Boston posted on CNN iReport an open letter to Feinstein explaining why he would not abide by an assault weapons ban. ""I do not believe it is the government's right to know what I own,"" he wrote in the post, which went viral. ""Nor do I think it prudent to tell you what I own so that it may be taken from me by a group of people who enjoy armed protection yet decry me having the same a crime."" On Tuesday, Nick DiOrio responded with his own iReport. Marines don't believe in following the law ""only when it suits us,"" DiOrio wrote, calling Boston's letter ""embarrassing because he makes Marines seem insensitive and uncaring."" DiOrio said he supports an assault weapons ban.","White House responds to petition calling for Piers Morgan to be deported .

"Washington (CNN) -- Hers is a struggle shared by all freshly arrived refugees in the United States. Learning English. Getting a job. Adapting to American culture. But starting life anew has been that much tougher for Eman al-Obeidi, the woman who came to embody the cruelty of Moammar Gadhafi's regime in the midst of Libya's brutal civil war. She lives every day with the scars of the rape she alleges was committed by Gadhafi's thugs. Sometimes, she said in an exclusive interview with CNN, she gets so depressed that she doesn't leave her apartment for days. Other times, she can't even get out of bed for three or four days. ""I cry all the time just like little children,"" she says wiping dry her moist eyes. ""And I always smile, too."" Al-Obeidi found relief on these shores when she arrived here last summer. She finally felt safe, unlike in Libya, where she felt constantly in danger and her family was threatened. But she has found it hard to make ends meet. She said she has been going to the employment office for four months but job opportunities have been slim. ""When I came, I never imagined life would be this hard,"" she said. ""As we say in Libya, you have to kill yourself working. I wish there was work. There are no work opportunities."" Her family in Libya sends her $300 a month. Without that, she said, she would not have made it so far. Out of desperation, last week, al-Obeidi bought a one-way ticket from Colorado to Washington with money from an Iraqi family. She had all but $100 in her bag; she used $65 of it and took a taxi to the Libyan Embassy in Washington. She came with a distrust of politicians and diplomats but with hope in her heart that her compatriots would not turn her away. But Libyan Ambassador Ali Aujali, she said, spoke to her like a father. He offered her an educational stipend. And health insurance. ""It means everything to me,"" she said, opening up an envelope containing check for $1,800. ""It's not about whether it's a lot or little. It's about the time that I got it,"" she said. It was like winning the lottery. Otherwise, she might have wound up on the street in a few days. Aujali said he thought al-Obeidi needs help. ""I told her one thing,"" he said. ""You have to close the doors to the past and look to the future. She cannot live in misery the rest of her life."" Al-Obeidi first caught the world's attention in March when she burst into Tripoli's Rixos Hotel, where foreign journalists were staying, and publicly accused members of Gadhafi's forces of gang-raping her. She was hysterical. She screamed that she had been taken from a checkpoint and held against her will for two days while being beaten and raped by 15 of Gadhafi's militiamen. Security officials said al-Obeidi was ""mentally ill"" and was being taken to a ""hospital."" They dragged her unceremoniously to a waiting white car and whisked her away. She wasn't heard from for more than a week, but eventually in media interviews, she spoke of her ordeal. She fled to Tunisia in May with the help of a defected military officer and the Libyan rebels, then in the thick of civil war. She found temporary sanctuary in Qatar before being granted asylum in the United States. Al-Obeidi arrived in New York at the end of July and with the help of a refugee agency, she was resettled in Colorado. She has no family in the United States, and she would perhaps like to return to her homeland one day. ""Of course, there is no one who doesn't wish to go back to his country,"" she said. ""But I am not mentally ready for that. I also feel personally I am not ready to integrate back into society, I am not ready. I feel life is hard for me because it is different -- in culture ... language -- everything is different here."" Al-Obeidi cannot know the twists and turns her life will take from here. She wants to finish schooling. Marry. Five years from now, she pictures herself as a mother. One thing she knows though. If and when she returns home, it will be to a Libya without Gadhafi. She just wishes Gadhafi had met proper justice. She felt his killers did him a favor by ending his life. In the eyes of some, he became a martyr. ""They shouldn't have given him this honor,"" she said. He should have been tried for his crimes, she said -- for what he did to the people of Libya, for what he did to her. CNN's Suzanne Malveaux reported from Washington and Moni Basu reported from Atlanta. CNN's Khalil Abdallah contributed to this report.","Eman al-Obeidi arrived in the United States in July .

"(CNN) -- Two days before Election Day, Vice President Joe Biden paid a visit to foot soldiers serving on the front lines of the 2012 campaign: suburban Colorado. Early voting had been under way in the Western battleground for weeks; the Obama team was counting on a volunteer army to deliver the state. The polls in the race's final weeks had careened back and forth between razor-thin Obama and Romney leads. But Biden told the volunteers he wasn't worried -- and they were the reason: ""The ground operation which you guys represent is the best in the history of presidential politics."" ""I'm telling you, it's this way in Virginia, it's this way in Florida. ... And I think that the one thing that is going to fundamentally make the difference is you guys -- for real,"" Biden said. ""I'm not just trying to be nice. I really genuinely believe that's the deal."" Obama takes key battlegrounds to win election . Republicans, surveying the very same landscape at the very same time, sounded a much more skeptical note. ""We are poised to blow the Obama campaign out on Election Day thanks to a superior GOTV (get out the vote) program,"" Republican National Committee political director Rick Wiley wrote in a memo sent the day after Biden's Colorado visit. ""The Obama campaign's superior ground game is a myth,"" said Wiley, promising a GOP victory. ""It's (ground) game over."" Just one day later, Republicans were echoing the vice president's assessment, with one top Republican telling CNN: ""Their (ground game) deal was much more real than I expected."" On paper, Democrats' turnout efforts this year dwarfed those of their GOP counterparts. The 125 million voter contacts the Obama team claimed were more than twice the Republican total. The hundreds of Democratic field offices outnumbered GOP outposts by greater than 2-1 or 3-1 in key swing states. But the Obama campaign insisted it wasn't just about the numbers. Obama's re-election makes history, again . ""Many field campaigns have historically favored quantity over quality. We do not,"" Obama national field director Jeremy Bird told reporters just before Election Day. ""These are not phone calls made from a call center. They are done at the local level by our neighborhood team leaders, members and volunteers, who are talking to people in their communities."" And in an election cycle where billions of dollars were spent on attack ads -- far more than ever before -- that kind of old-school retail politicking may have made the difference. In the home stretch, the Romney campaign pointed to a big jump in voter contacts this year over John McCain's 2008 effort. But a significant percentage of the voter contacts they pointed to included indirect contact -- like door hangers -- that didn't give voters the all-important sense of personal connection. Meanwhile, the Obama campaign's turnout effort flooded the zone. While Republicans were still battling for the nomination in the spring, the number of Obama field offices in key primary season states likely to play significant roles in the fall -- states like Ohio, New Hampshire and Florida -- already outnumbered those of all his potential GOP challengers combined, even though the president wasn't facing any primary season challengers. Even with a massive infrastructure advantage and major head start, an Obama edge on the ground was no sure thing. Republican enthusiasm was far higher in 2012 than it had been four years earlier, and indications were that Democratic enthusiasm had slipped. Well-funded super PACs took on some ground game efforts for the Romney campaign, and polls conducted in the home stretch found voters in the most hotly contested battlegrounds felt they'd been only slightly more likely to hear from Obama's campaign than Romney's. Americans demand more from Obama's second term . But these super PAC turnout operations were largely new and untested compared with the Obama machine and veteran union allies. Even with aggressive outreach to voters, both they and the Romney campaign were ultimately less likely to actually reach voters than the Obama team. And in an election where swing state percentage gaps between the two candidates were in the single digits, even the slimmest gains along the margins loomed large. Record-breaking numbers of voters cast their ballots before Election Day this year -- half the voting population or higher in some states -- and the Obama campaign was able to bank huge leads weeks ahead of the race's final day. Republicans played down the disparity in field offices and early vote totals. The office and staffer count, they said, were meaningless metrics. ""If we wanted to have as many staff and offices, we could do that,"" Romney political director Rich Beeson told reporters last month. But these Obama outposts, no matter how small, weren't just window dressing; they filled a couple of key functions. Since each was staffed with at least one Obama for America staffer, they served as an initial point of contact with the campaign, and a recruitment center for local volunteers. They provided a central location for campaign events, for phone banking and for data collection. And their permanence allowed the campaign to develop vital local insight: to build detailed voter files on potential supporters, field test the best ways to motivate them, and push them to cast their votes weeks before Election Day. Opinion: Obama will get little time to celebrate . Republicans said those early voting efforts by the president's campaign were just tapping out their support from voters who would have shown up for him in the end anyway -- and that the edge fueled by early voting would evaporate when Republican voters headed to the polls on Election Day. They weren't entirely wrong; a good chunk of those early Democratic votes came from banking ballots from the president's strongest supporters, base voters who would have shown up no matter what. But that early vote cushion wasn't just cosmetic. It helped create an aura of inevitability on the ground in key swing states. It provided an insurance policy against potential vote loss to Election Day lines and snafus. And instead of devoting valuable home stretch resources to bringing guaranteed votes to the polls on Election Day, the campaign could instead focus on using those hard-core supporters as Election Day foot soldiers, employing the most personal and effective form of voter persuasion to bring less enthusiastic backers to the polls. ""You go as hard as you can until the end. That's what we're going to do until the very end,"" said Obama campaign manager Jim Messina. The end in Colorado: a 50%-47% win for the president.","Analysis: Robust field campaigning, direct contact with voters made the difference .

"London (CNN) -- With the World Cup in 2014, the Olympics two years later and large discoveries of oil boosting the economy, Brazilians could be excused for looking at the world through rose-tinted glasses. The world's party country -- home to samba dance and Carnival -- is enjoying an economic cocktail of low unemployment and easy consumer credit, propelling many Brazilians into the country's burgeoning middle class. But while tens of millions of people have been hauled out of poverty, questions are being raised around the risks of a consumer-driven boom. In the last decade, effective anti-poverty policies such as ""Bolsa Familia"" -- translated as Family Bag -- introduced by former President Lula and carried on by incumbent Dilma Rousseff, have helped transform Brazil's workforce and increase the minimum wage. Read more: Building on 'BRICS': The next emerging economies . ""Brazil used to be one of the most unequal countries in the world,"" Naercio Mezenes Filho, professor of economics at Brazillian business school, Insper, told CNN. He added: ""Unskilled labor is in short supply right now because the youngest have remained in school compared to the past."" Brazil -- with a population of 190 million people scattered across its Atlantic coast -- is famed for its billionaire tycoons like mining magnate Eike Batista or banker Jorge Paulo Lemann, Brazil's richest man. Read more: Rising Brazil tackles immigration question . And while wealth disparity remains an issue in Latin America's largest economy, Brazil is beginning to see a change in the tide, according to Jens Arnold, head of the Brazil desk at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. He told CNN that Brazil's population is seeing a new trend as some of the poorest 10% in the country shake off poverty. Read more: Building on 'BRICS': The next emerging economies . Arnold said: ""More people have access to better paying jobs... [and] living standards are coming up, particularly for those who are below the poverty line."" Could the boom bust? Many Brazilians who once inhabited the gang-ridden shanty towns, known as favelas, now have the disposable income to shop for aspirational products, from cars to DVD players. And that's not all. Robust and highly-capitalized banks are offering easy lines of credit to Brazilian consumers who find themselves in regular employment. Read more: Is Brazil ready to take sporting center stage? Edmund Amann, senior lecturer in social sciences at Manchester University, told CNN that Brazil's economy is experiencing a consumer-borrowing model of growth. ""There's been quite a surge in domestic consumption,"" he said. ""That has centered on consumer durables, not least automobiles,"" Amann added. Store cards are the most popular way to shop in Brazil, allowing customers to pay for goods in regular installments rather than meeting the full price up front. A study by McKinsey & Company in 2012 showed that 40% of consumers said they shop more in stores that extend credit, six times more than the U.S. data from the Central Bank of Brazil in 2009 indicated that use of retail cards increased over 100% from 2004 to 2008. Read more: Brazil competes with China, India to invest in Africa . Amann said although the increase in household debt is unlikely to cause a bubble, there is a chance investors could be spooked with the crisis in Europe and the U.S. still causing global pain. But Amann noted Brazil's economy is protected by a buoyant commodity market and said of consumer appetite: ""Financial education is important... for many people, this will be their first experience of a formal financial arrangement where they have a bank account and have access to lending."" While Naercio believes inflation risk -- currently at 6.5% in Brazil -- is one of the biggest threats to Brazil, with easy lending from public-sector banks hitting consumers if the economy fails to grow. However, ""I don't think there is any chance we will see what happened in the U.S. and Europe in the property crash,"" he said. A bright future . In 2001 Brazil was included in the term BRIC, an acronym coined by then-Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill, to describe the next big emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China. Brazil -- the world's sixth largest economy -- is beginning to see its mining and commodities sectors bear fruit, particularly oil and iron ore. And despite Brazil's disappointing economic data for the last two years relative to its high-growth brethren, Arnold believes Brazil has a bright future ahead. He said: ""We expect this to come back to potential growth rates and we expect a recovery to be taking place in this year."" Amman told CNN he was ""no doomsayer"" on the Brazilian economy but added that the country needed to move to a ""Chinese model"" of investment to kick-start growth. Amann said: ""The biggest single risk the economy faces is a collapse on commodity prices... we probably are approaching the limit of a consumer borrowing based growth model.""","With the World Cup and Olympics on the way, Brazilians could be excused for wearing rose-tinted glasses .

"(CNN) -- A Tudor warship sunk off the English coast more than 400 years ago will go on display in a new museum Friday, along with thousands of artifacts recovered with the wreck. The Mary Rose, which is still undergoing conservation work, is the only 16th century warship on display in the world, according to the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. The 500-year-old vessel was the flagship of King Henry VIII and sank in his view off the south coast near Portsmouth on July 19, 1545, while leading an attack against a French invasion fleet. It remained there until it was raised from the seabed in 1982 to great fanfare. Over the decades since, the wooden hull has been sprayed continuously, first with fresh water to remove salt and then with a wax solution, to prevent the timbers drying out and shrinking. That spray was turned off last month to allow the next phase of conservation to be carried out, the dockyard said. While the ship is on display, it will be dried out in a specially constructed airtight glass chamber. More than 100 tons of water will be extracted from the hull over the next four to five years, conservationists say. Once that process is complete, the walls will be removed to give visitors an unimpeded view of the ship. The new Mary Rose Museum, built at the Portsmouth dockyard at a cost of Â£27 million ($40.7 million), also houses many of the 19,000 artifacts raised with the ship. Items on display include the skeleton of the ship's dog, wooden bowls, leather shoes, musical instruments and combs complete with 500-year-old head lice, as well as weapons such as longbows and metal cannon. Many of the ship's crew died when she went down. The raising of the ship and its preservation were landmarks in marine archeology, the dockyard says.","The Mary Rose, flagship of Henry VIII, was raised from the seabed in 1982 .

"(CNN) -- By the time you read this Twitter may have already announced it's getting into the online-music business. If so, they will have plenty of company -- courtesy of some of the tech world's biggest names. After days of speculation, Twitter on Friday rolled out a Web page for Twitter Music. Of course, it was a page that didn't do anything, but sent a pretty clear signal that the much speculated-about service was about to become a reality. (The prevailing theory late Friday was that it would go live over the weekend, in conjunction with the Coachella music festival. But it did not.) Early reports suggest the service will let users listen to the songs that are trending as most popular on Twitter and elsewhere on the Web. And it would be only one of several music-streaming services to either be introduced recently or rumored to be in the works. And it's not just startups with names like Grooveshark any more. Google, Apple and Microsoft are among the major players now in the mix. Why are so many Internet titans getting into the game? The answer is simple: dollars and cents. Online streaming, by which users listen to music either for free or for a monthly fee, is the fastest growing form of music listening, according to industry reports. The Recording Industry Association of America, in its annual report, said that while overall music sales were down in 2012, digital-music sales were up 14%, topping $4 billion. ""Digital growth was driven by large increases in revenues through what can broadly be referred to as 'access models,' where users can choose to listen from large libraries of music rather than purchasing individual songs or albums,"" the report read. At the top of that heap are sites like Pandora and Spotify. Pandora lets users give it suggestions, then creates a personalized radio station. Spotify lets users pick exactly what they want to listen to out of a library of more than 16 million songs. Both make money either through ads or by letting users pay a monthly fee to go ad-free. Spotify has made no bones about its desire to make even the Apple iTunes model for digital music obsolete. Why pay for music when you can listen to virtually anything you want to hear for free (or for a modest fee), they ask? (Some musical artists would say because it helps them make a living wage, instead of fractions of a penny for each of their songs played.) For the first time, royalties earned from digital-music services in the UK just surpassed licensing revenues from radio broadcasts. And digital streaming is growing particularly fast among younger users. A Nielsen research poll from August suggested that teens now discover and listen to music on YouTube more often than on the radio, iTunes or CDs. ""The accessibility of music has seen tremendous expansion and diversification,"" said David Bakula, a Nielsen senior vice president. ""While younger listeners opt for technologically advanced methods, traditional methods of discovery like radio and word-of-mouth continue to be strong drivers."" Here's a closer look at the heavyweights hoping to get their share of the increasingly lucrative music market. Twitter . On Thursday, music-discovery company We Are Hunted confirmed reports that it had been bought out by Twitter. Instantly gone from the Internet, We Are Hunted would search blogs, social media and other sites for new music that was picking up serious buzz and add it to a constantly updated stream. One would assume Twitter plans something similar. ""We can't wait to share what we've been working on at Twitter,"" reads a message on the now-closed Hunted site. ""We wish we could say (what it is), but we're not yet ready to talk about it. You'll hear more from us when we are."" DJ turned ""American Idol"" host Ryan Seacrest praised the app on Twitter on Thursday, saying it ""shows what artists are trending, also has up and coming artists."" The official rollout could happen at Coachella on Saturday, though Twitter did not respond to a request for comment and had not confirmed that as of Friday afternoon. Apple . Reports have suggested that Apple, which already lets iTunes users listen to their own music libraries, is also eyeing the streaming-music space. Last month, reports surfaced that CEO Tim Cook had met with Beats Electronics, founded by hip-hop producer Dr. Dre and music-industry stalwart Jimmy Iovine. The maker of the popular ""Beats by Dre"" and other headphones announced in January that it had begun ""Project Daisy,"" a music-subscription service. Eddy Cue, an Apple executive who played a major role in creating iTunes, also attended the meeting, Reuters quoted three unnamed sources as saying. In its announcement of Daisy, Beats said the service would be released in late 2013 and ""bring an emotional connection back to the act of music discovery."" Google . Google, meanwhile, is reportedly working to expand the already wide reach of YouTube in the Web music world. For young listeners, YouTube is already a massive music-discovery and listening tool.

"(CNN) -- Lipitor, the popular cholesterol-lowering drug, loses its patent Wednesday, paving the way for cheaper generic versions. ""For generic drugs, they have the same active ingredient as the brand-name drug and the big difference is they tend to be significantly less expensive,"" said Dr. Glen Stettin, chief medical officer of Medco, one of the country's largest pharmacy benefits manager. More than 17 million people have been prescribed Lipitor, according to its manufacturer Pfizer. Last year, Lipitor's sale added up to more than $5 billion in the United States alone, according to Medco. While it is not known how much cheaper the generic version of the cholesterol-lowering drug will be, Pfizer is working with pharmacy benefit companies to lower co-payments to hold on to as many customers as possible. When drug companies develop a drug, the Food and Drug Administration usually grants them exclusive rights to market the drug for a set period of time. When those rights expire, other companies can make same drug. The competition results in cheaper generic versions. The FDA says the regulations are ""designed to promote a balance between new drug innovation and generic drug competition.""","Doctor: Generic drugs tend to be significantly less expensive .

"(CNN) -- A group of African-American church leaders announced Wednesday their intention to join ranks with the Occupy movement in the nation's capital, bolstering what some consider a mutual message of condemning income inequality and social injustice. The move comes against the backdrop of evictions of Occupy protesters encamped in city parks and squares across the United States, raising questions about whether the two groups can capitalize on momentum gained by the months-long movement. ""We are occupying until poverty is eradicated,"" pastor Jamal Harrison Bryant told reporters at the National Press Club in Washington, near where a core group of activists remains encamped. The two groups plan to gather during a national ""day of action"" scheduled for January 16, set to coincide with the commemoration of former civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. But could Wednesday's announcement signify that Occupy is now shifting toward more established forms of influence? ""Every successful movement begins with a grievance and turns into an agenda,"" said Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. By linking up with black church leaders, he said, the group can tap into a community with years of experience in social movements. Since September, activists have gathered to draw attention to corporate greed and the excesses of the so-called 1%, a reference to the nation's elite, who protesters say wield disproportionate influence over the rest of the country. Their message, though popular, has also been criticized for its lack of focus. But on Wednesday, church leaders outlined a more specific call to lawmakers, asking for a moratorium on foreclosures, an increase in federal Pell grants to students and added national funding for job training. In past months demonstrators have largely shunned established political figures, wary of being co-opted by outside influence. And yet outside groups have largely been involved, swelling demonstrator marches with union ranks in cities like New York, where activists first encamped in a lower Manhattan park. ""When they had physical spaces, then the point was to be there,"" added Galston of the encampments. ""But the movement has to move from occupation to something else."" Last month, authorities in New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia dismantled tents and arrested protesters who refused to leave city parks and squares. On Saturday, police arrested 46 people in Boston, sweeping through a downtown square to evict people rooted there since late September. ""I think there is a danger"" the movement could lose momentum without these physical spaces, said Elisabeth Jacobs, a Brookings fellow in governance studies. ""But I'm not sure that it's a foregone conclusion. ""There's a pretty lively Web space for this community."" But whether the movement can evolve into an ""Occupy 2.0"" could be key to its survival as a relevant social movement in the months and years ahead. That evolution may also require adopting more institutional forms of influence, such as lobbying and use of the courts, which protesters have often labeled corrupt. ""People might be a little frustrated that the movement is taking a new shape,"" Jacobs said. But with the loss of landmark encampments in places like Manhattan's Zuccotti Park and Boston's Dewey Square, ""I'm not sure what they're actually trying to accomplish if they don't adapt."" The group's Twitter feed, meanwhile, remained abuzz with online activity on Wednesday. ""How do we take back our govt from corrupt and incompetent elected officials?"" read one post. ""Keep the dream ALIVE,"" read another. CNN's Stacey Samuel in Washington contributed to this report.","A group of African-American church leaders announce they'll join the Occupy movement .

"(CNN) -- Get your brain ready for a game show that requires no knowledge of trivia or prices -- just curiosity. National Geographic Channel is premiering Monday night a new series called ""Brain Games,"" a fun, smart show that, in a nontraditional way, teaches you how your mind works. ""My hope is that people come out of it in awe of themselves,"" said host Jason Silva, formerly a presenter on Current TV. Each episode zooms in on a different aspect of how our brains work, in areas such as focus, fear, motion and persuasion. During each half-hour program, viewers engage in several games that show how our brains might not be operating the way we expect. Experts in various fields of cognition join in to explain what's going on. Through perceptual experiments, interactive games and illusions, the show is able to, in a sense, ""hack your brain,"" Silva said. You might think that everything you see is like high-definition TV, that you perceive the world around you in perfect detail. But the truth is that the attentional spotlight of your brain is only about the size of your thumbnail; about 1/1000th of your field of view. As Silva says on the show: It's as if your attention is a spotlight, and you can only shine it on one thing at a time. This is your brain on music . Your brain fills in the rest on its own, in order to save energy, so everything around you doesn't immediately jump out and demand focus. Perhaps you have noticed, for instance, that while commuting to work you are thinking about all sorts of things that don't involve being in the car, train or bus that you ride every day. Your brain has already stored a model of your environment, so you might not notice something unusual right next to you. That's called inattentional blindness. ""The brain creates these mental models of the world so that you can function, but the consequence is that it makes you less present, so we don't notice what's around us on a regular basis,"" Silva said. ""We're blind to what surrounds us."" Apollo Robbins, a performer and expert in deception, takes advantage of that fact when playing card tricks and engaging in other trickery on the show. You might think of this as ""misdirection,"" but Robbins says in a video on the show's website that he likes to think of it as ""managing attention."" In one episode, he gets many volunteers to look through a deck of cards for the card they started with. Actually, the card is on Robbins' head, but they're so focused on the task that they don't immediately notice. ""Even backstage, he's able to weave my attention in any direction that he wants,"" Silva said. Top brain scientist is 'philosopher at heart' Another game makes use of the relatively poor peripheral vision that we all have. There's a giant X in the middle of the screen and two cheerleaders on either side of it. If you keep your eyes focused on the X, can you tell which one of the cheerleaders is actually a man wearing a skirt and a wig? It's a lot harder than you might think. The show is particularly relevant now, given recent movements toward advancing brain science, Silva said. Earlier this month, President Barack Obama announced a $100 million initiative called Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies, or BRAIN. It ""aims to help researchers find new ways to treat, cure and even prevent brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury,"" the White House said in a release. Another major brain research initiative is called the Human Brain Project, based in Europe. Scientists at the Human Brain Project are using supercomputers to simulate the way the brain works in order to understand it better. Henry Markram at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland is leading this effort. In January, the European Commission awarded this international effort about €1 billion ($1.3 billion). The show's executive producer, Jerry Kolber, said he wanted to make a game show where the viewer would also be contestants. He wanted it to be a ""science show without the 's-word.'"" Of course, the ""s-word"" is ""science."" Kolber said he was personally amazed by the episode on fear, in which the show explores how the stress we feel in modern life about things like an overflowing e-mail inbox are derivative of fear. The fear response is something that evolved in humans, and dates back to when our primitive ancestors had to be on high alert in case of animal attacks. ""Our brain wants us to feel stress in situations that are uncomfortable,"" Kolber said. ""That's its way of putting you on alert."" What's different now, of course, is that in modern life, the stress response is being triggered dozens of times a day, which isn't healthy, he said. ""Brain Games"" premieres at 9 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. ET/PT Monday on the National Geographic Channel.

"New York (CNN) -- A car careens onto a sidewalk, bowls over a 17-year-old woman and crushes the stroller holding her 8-month-old daughter. The mother immediately jumps up and frantically begins trying to pull the baby out from under the car. Within seconds she has her. Both are taken to a hospital, but neither is badly hurt. ""God helped us,"" mother Alondra Gervacio told CNN on Wednesday as she held her daughter. The incident was caught on a surveillance camera overlooking a Bronx sidewalk just before 1 p.m. Tuesday. Police say a 68-year-old driver lost consciousness behind the wheel of a livery cab, or a car for hire. The Lincoln Town Car struck one vehicle stopped at a red light and another vacant parked car, and then sped down the sidewalk directly at Gervacio and her infant. The surveillance video shows Gervacio, start to go to her left, then pull the stroller back to the right, barely managing to get it out of the way of the front of the car. But both are struck by the side of the car. The woman is sent sprawling but the stroller is pulled underneath the vehicle, just in front of the rear tire. The impact happened just as the car hit a storefront and came to a skidding halt. The video then shows the woman rush to the car, fall to her knees and begin tugging at the crumpled stroller. She pulls the child out and quickly carries her away. ""I didn't stop for my pain or nothing,"" Gervacio said. ""I just wanted to look for her and she was under the taxi."" The baby was not wedged under the car, but was lying sideways. Both the mother and child were taken to Lincoln Medical Center, according to the police report. The unconscious driver of the livery cab was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead. Police said he had suffered a heart attack, CNN affiliate WABC reported. The stopped vehicle that the Town Car first struck had two passengers inside, but neither requested medical attention, according to police. George Martinez, the livery owner, told WABC-TV the car's driver was ""a nice responsible driver ... always responsible."" Gervacio said she went to church after she got out of the hospital. Her daughter spent the night at the hospital for observation. Her cousin, Vanessa Sanchez, recalled seeing the surveillance tape. ""She really got lucky,"" Sanchez said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Mitt Romney told Latino business leaders this week in Los Angeles that he is convinced the ""Republican Party is the rightful home of Hispanic Americans,"" but added that ""my speech today isn't about my political party."" With good reason. Unable to close ground on President Barack Obama in the polls, the GOP challenger seeks to woo Hispanic American voters but finds himself hindered by the conservative stance he took on immigration policy in order to win the Republican primary campaign. Now, his opposition to Obama's move this summer to halt deportations of some children of illegal immigrants puts Romney at odds with a majority of Latino voters, especially younger ones in the fastest-growing demographic of the U.S. population. Facing a highly anticipated appearance on Wednesday at the Univision News ""Meet the Candidates"" forum in Miami, Romney has struggled to explain his stance on the issue because of the difference between what his party base demands and what most Hispanic Americans want to hear. Opinion: Romney better off as a Latino? He demonstrated his dilemma in an interview on Monday with Spanish-language Telemundo's Jose Diaz-Balart. Romney lambasted Obama's economic policies in making the case for why the Latino electorate that traditionally backs Democrats should vote for him this time. But he sounded uncomfortable when asked if he would continue the administration's halt in deporting so-called dreamers -- young illegal immigrants brought to America as children who want to study and work in the country where they grew up. Conservatives oppose the Obama program, calling it an amnesty that increases competition for scarce jobs. During the primary campaign, Romney said he opposed the DREAM Act, a Democratic proposal blocked by congressional Republicans, but also called for an unspecified GOP version that has yet to emerge from the party or his campaign. ""I'm going to make sure that we have a permanent solution to help dreamers, to help these young people who came to this country through no fault of their own, brought here by their parents,"" Romney told Diaz-Balart, adding that ""I want them to understand what their permanent status is. And from the very beginning of my administration, I will work to put in place legislation that is -- that deals with the major immigration issues that America faces, including that one."" He repeated his past intention to provide a pathway to permanent residency for those who served in the military, adding he would work with Congress to find a ""reasonable solution."" When Diaz-Balart then asked what happens in a Romney administration to the hundreds of thousands who would benefit from the Obama program, Romney responded: ""Well, I'm going to put in place an immigration reform proposal that makes sure that they have a solution."" Would that mean dreamers get deported, Diaz -Balart asked, to which Romney replied: ""Well, they're -- they're -- they're not deported immediately today. And -- and that's not, that has not been the practice. My practice is to make sure these people have a permanent understanding and a solution to this issue."" Weak standing among Hispanic voters . To CNN contributor Ana Navarro, a Latina Republican, such equivocation contributes to Romney's weak standing among Hispanic American voters. The ImpreMedia/Latino Decisions weekly tracking poll reported Monday that Obama held a 68%-26% advantage over Romney among Hispanic Americans. ""Romney needs to move beyond his positions during the primary,"" Navarro wrote in an online commentary. ""He promised to veto the Dream Act. He should then tell us if and how he plans to confront the predicament these young people face."" In particular, Navarro asked if a President Romney would revoke or let stand Obama's administrative order providing dreamers with a two-year reprieve from possible deportation, adding: ""A simple yes or no will suffice."" Clarissa Martinez, the director of civic engagement for the National Council of La Raza, agreed that Romney needs to clarify his position to have any chance of making headway with Latino voters. ""The question is what would a Romney administration do?"" Martinez told CNN, adding that Obama can strengthen his position by hammering Romney on the dreamer deportation issue ""because Romney has not come up with a specific position."" According to the ImpreMedia-Latino Decisions poll, immigration is the second-most important issue to Latino voters, behind the economy. With the November vote likely to be decided in nine battleground states considered toss-ups at this point, the Latino demographic could be crucial in some tightly contested races. For example, North Carolina's 15 electoral votes are up for grabs in a state Obama won by 14,177 votes four years ago. With more than 182,000 eligible Latino voters in the state, according to the Latino Decisions website, the presidential breakdown could play a major role in determining who wins. Gaining traction with Latino voters requires the same kind of campaigning as any other demographic, Martinez said. ""The prescription is not much different,"" she said, advocating outreach and building relationships. ""The question is the substance. What are the issues and what are you saying about them?"" For both Romney and Obama, ""answering some of these lingering questions would help the outreach go further,"" Martinez said. ""You give voters specificity so they have something to vote for and not just something to vote against."" Can Romney connect with Latino voters? Immigration advisers . Another issue of concern to Latino voters involves Romney's advisers on immigration, Martinez said, noting concerns about the role that Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach could play in a Romney administration. Kobach, the architect of tough immigration laws in Alabama and Arizona, says he has been advising Romney for years, and the Romney campaign described him as an ""informal adviser."" However, Romney told Univision America Radio on Monday that he had never met with Kobach. ""He may well be part of a policy team,"" Romney said. ""I have not met with him yet. And don't know whether he is or he is not."" In January, Romney expressed gratitude when the conservative Kobach endorsed him for the Republican nomination. ""I'm so proud to earn Kris's support,"" he said in a statement at the time. ""Kris has been a true leader on securing our borders and stopping the flow of illegal immigration into this country. We need more conservative leaders like Kris willing to stand up for the rule of law."" In another past comment that could draw fire this week, Romney acknowledged at a private fundraiser in May the difficulty Republicans have in winning support from Hispanic American voters. A secretly recorded video of Romney's remarks shows him saying that ""if the Hispanic voting bloc becomes as committed to the (Democratic Party) as the African America voting bloc, then we are in trouble as a party and I think as a nation.""

"(CNN) -- Tim Sherwood said he wants to become Tottenham's next permanent manager. Beating Southampton in his first league game in charge as caretaker on Sunday wouldn't have hurt his chances. And not only did Spurs win, but they did so in style, rallying to edge the struggling Saints 3-2 away from home. It was the first time Tottenham scored three goals in an English Premier League match this season and the lack of goals was one of the reasons Andre Villas-Boas got the sack last week. ""I really enjoyed it today, but one swallow does not make a summer,"" Sherwood, a former England midfielder, told Sky Sports. Sherwood threw caution to the wind and fielded an attacking lineup, starting strikers Emmanuel Adebayor and Roberto Soldado -- Villas-Boas usually just played with one up front -- as well as Erik Lamela and Gylfi Sigurdsson. ""I like to set teams up like that,"" said Sherwood. ""There are no rules, there are different ways to win a football match. You have to do what you believe."" The previously out-of-favor Adebayor scored twice, adding to his strike in the League Cup under Sherwood, and Tottenham was in charge after drawing level in the first half. Tottenham reclaimed seventh from Manchester United and trails new league-leader Liverpool by six points. The top five in England are separated by a mere three points. ""I am very happy for the new manager,"" Adebayor, who has also lined up for Real Madrid, Manchester City and Arsenal, told Sky. ""First day he told me to, 'Get out there and play football, you know how to do it because of the clubs you have played for.'"" Adam Lallana gave Southampton the lead in the 13th minute with a long-range effort but Tottenham wasn't behind for long. Adebayor volleyed Soldado's cross in the 25th minute and central defender Jos Hooiveld scored into his own net under pressure in the penalty box early in the second half. Southampton, against the run of play, equalized when Lallana set up Rickie Lambert for a tap in before Adebayor's winner in the 64th minute. Soldado, who like Lamela has struggled since a big money move in the summer, then squandered three good opportunities but Southampton failed to make Tottenham pay. Once occupying a Champions League spot, Southampton is now ninth and winless in its last six. Everton moved into fourth, ahead of Chelsea, when it beat Swansea 2-1 later Sunday. Ross Barkley scored the winner with a stunning free kick in the 85th minute. The Toffees have the fewest losses in the league under newish boss Roberto Martinez -- one. On Monday, Arsenal hosts Chelsea. The Gunners need to win to leapfrog Liverpool and head the standings at Christmas.","Tottenham rallies to beat Southampton 3-2 in the English Premier League .

"(CNN) -- On a walk through Central Park about a decade ago, Bob Staake noticed a bird swooping from branch to branch, as if to follow a group of kids walking below. Maybe it was a trick of the eye, something people see and forget. Staake, a writer and illustrator, couldn't shake it. ""I thought, 'Boy, that's a good story,'"" he said. It was fully formed in his mind: It could be a children's book. The place would be New York, with flashes of Columbus Circle, Central Park, even the World Trade Center towers. The illustrations would be almost monochromatic, all blues and grays. The story would be wordless, ""of course."" It would follow a lonely boy and his bluebird friend through joy and wonder, then fear and loss at the hands of bullies. For years, the idea went nowhere. Staake had other projects and obligations -- books to write, New Yorker covers to draw -- and besides, he was sure nobody would publish it. ""Let me get this straight,"" he knew any editor would ask, ""the bird dies?"" Early drafts of the art drew attention on Facebook, including the eyes of an editor at Schwartz & Wade Books, an imprint of Random House Children's Books. ""Bluebird"" hit bookstore shelves this spring. Since then, Staake has been on the road, ""reading"" the book to kids and adults -- describing the images, and letting listeners come to their own conclusions about what happens to the bird, boy and bullies. Wordless picture books have had a big few years. Several won the Caldecott Medal for picture book artwork, including ""A Ball for Daisy"" in 2012, ""The Lion and the Mouse"" in 2010 and ""Flotsam"" in 2007. Even Staake, who wrote and illustrated children's books ""The Donut Chef"" and ""The First Pup,"" was surprised by the details kids spotted in his drawings -- and the variety of ways people interpreted his story. ""Kids are far more intelligent than we give them credit for,"" he said from his studio in Cape Cod. ""Whether you're a child or an adult, it's so universal, it resonates with everyone."" Between work on magazine covers, newspaper illustrations and a new picture book about a child who has a book for a pet, here's what Staake had to say about ""Bluebird."" CNN: You said ""of couse"" the story would be wordless -- why? Bob Staake: Never in the history of children's literature has a 5-year-old walked into a bookstore and laid down $18 for a picture book. These are precious items that are passed down from an adult that has a wallet in his or her pants. You have to find a way to resonate with the adult. But beyond that, kids look. They don't read a book. They look at a book. It's as worthwhile to look at pictures as it is to read words. (As a kid), I would pull books out of the library, I'd look at National Geographic and dream about those incredible places. I didn't necessarily read the words. You can tell his broad story page to page to page by simply having a child inferring. It's a magical thing. We should all be so lucky to have a book that's so open-ended that it's ripe for interpretations all over the place. CNN: What do you think of all the ways people have interpreted the book and its ending? Staake: When I read it, I describe what's occurring on every page. (Kids) just go slack-jawed when they see the bird hit by the stick thrown by the bully. I say the little bird flies off and disappears by the cloud and you decide what happens. ""Does the bird die? Does the bird fly away? Does the bird go to heaven? What happens to the boy in the sky? Does he fly up with his friend?"" Getting a kid to read a book and ask questions, that's where we want all these books to be. That's an awesome thing. I'm an agnostic. I don't know what happens at the end of the book, but that doesn't matter. If people want to see it as a story about God, that's great. Heaven, great. I view it as a story about loss. I feel like the book could help families who are dealing with real, painful loss. The vast majority of people look at it and they do have their own interpretation, their own personal relationship with it. You determine how that book ends. CNN: Even if you see hope in the book, it still tackles pretty heavy themes for a picture book. Staake: If you've got your eyes wide open, you remember those less-than-beautiful moments in your childhood, when you were faced with these eye-opening lessons: People can be completely ridiculously obnoxious. It can be painful stuff. If I was bullied by a kid, they found out I could draw and all of a sudden, I was drawing cartoon characters for them. In a lot of ways, people might say ""You let them get their way."" I let them see what was beyond. They could appreciate that I had something that was really unique. Crazy, here I am a 55-year-old author, I constantly have to think back to 5, to Redondo Beach, California, those lessons I learned as a kid. CNN: What was it like to create the bullies and show how they changed after they hurt the bluebird? Staake: It's a tough thing to pull off. The bullies could not believe what they did. You infer that through the expressions. Those kids will never, ever bully again -- that's the way I view it. Those were really difficult scenes. I had to make sure they were remorseful. They know they pushed it too far, and they will never do it again. They run off in complete shame. Kids get it. CNN: How did you know kids would get it? Staake: They completely get it. I don't care if I talk to kindergartners or prekindergarten. Everything that happens in ""Bluebird"" I went through as a kid. Every kid does. There's no kid who isn't bullied, no kid who doesn't encounter kids who are completely irrational, gang mentality, no kid who doesn't look in the world, who doesn't have these moments of A-W-E awe. The best children's books come from the heart of the author. It sounds so trite and ridiculous, but if I can't go ahead and pull out from the depths of my childhood that experience that little Bobby Staake had, it doesn't have soul.","""Bluebird"" is writer and illustrator Bob Staake's new wordless children's book .

"(CNN) -- After more than half a century involved in motorsport, and three decades at the helm of Formula One, Bernie Ecclestone has no plans to quit just yet. In fact, the 81-year-old has told CNN that he will be in charge for as long as he lives. ""It'll probably depend a lot (on) when I die,"" Ecclestone said ahead of this weekend's Monaco Grand Prix when asked about his retirement plans. ""You never know, do you, with these things. I mean, it's not my intention to do such a thing. If I thought I couldn't do all the things I do, then the answer would be then we'd certainly consider it. At the moment it's not quite like that."" Ecclestone: Formula One teams agree to race until 2020 . Despite his age, Ecclestone is keeping himself very busy -- both personally and professionally. Earlier this month he announced his engagement to Brazilian Fabiani Flosi, 46 years his junior. He has also set his sights on further extending Formula One's global reach, having announced an agreement with the teams to continue racing under a Concorde Agreement until 2020. Austin, Texas will make its debut as grand prix venue in November, as the sport returns to the U.S. for the first time since 2007. India was introduced to F1 last year, with the Russian city of Sochi set to host a race in 2014 -- the same year the Black Sea resort will stage the Winter Olympics. ""It's good to have an American base,"" Ecclestone said. ""We are a world championship, so why not? We have races in other parts of the world so we should have maybe another race in America."" On the possibility of France hosting a race for the first time since 2008, he added: ""I think maybe the election that has taken place might have put that back a bit. When that all settles down I'm sure we'll get back on track -- literally,"" referring to Francois Hollande's recent presidential victory. ""I think you will have to wait and see if we see more. Only time will tell."" Should Formula One be so unpredictable? Ecclestone has been criticized for his determination to go ahead with the recent Bahrain Grand Prix, despite political unrest in the Gulf kingdom. But Eccleston cited the riots in London as an example of how social unrest does not necessarily mean a country should forfeit its right to host a race. ""I'd hate to lose the British race, for a start,"" he explained. ""We've seen what happened there at the end of last year, all those disturbances and all the other things that happen all over the world. ""I don't know where we'd have to find a nice place to race where there is no problem. It wouldn't be easy."" One arena F1 has not managed to enter is the Olympic Games, but Ecclestone revealed that talks over the seemingly far-fetched possibility have been held. ""I spoke to the former president, Mr. (Juan Antonio) Samaranch, years ago about this and we decided it was wrong to have mechanical sport involved. In fact I discussed it with the new president (Jacques Rogge) a year ago. ""They keep adding things in which I don't believe are Olympic things, so maybe it's possible. It would be nice to see it happen."" The current F1 season's first five races have produced five different winners for the first time since 1983. A major factor in the sport's current unpredictability has been the new Pirelli tires -- the team which masters the rapidly degrading rubber usually emerges victorious. Seven-time world champion and Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher has been heavily critical of the tires, telling CNN they are like driving on ""raw eggs,"" but Ecclestone praised the work done by the Italian manufacturer. ""I asked Pirelli if they could make a tire that would only run for a third of the race, which is a lot more difficult than making a tire that will run the whole race. That's easily done; it can run five races if you like. ""But to make one that will only run that distance is difficult. They've done a fantastic job and that's what has made this racing so exciting."" When reflecting on his contribution to F1, Ecclestone was relaxed when asked if he has received enough credit for what he has given to the sport, responding: ""I get what I deserve, I suppose."" And what is it that keeps the Englishman going after so long at the forefront of an ever-expanding business? ""Job satisfaction.""","Bernie Ecclestone tells CNN he intends to run Formula One until he dies .

"San Salvador, El Salvador (CNN) -- The plea of a pregnant woman to be granted an abortion has gripped El Salvador for months: She wanted an abortion after doctors told her that her baby would not survive outside the womb and that her life was at risk. But abortion is illegal without exceptions in El Salvador, and on Wednesday, the country's Supreme Court denied her petition. Atttorneys for the 22-year-old woman, known only as ""Beatriz,"" argued that the mother's life was at risk if the pregnancy was not terminated. Ill woman at center of abortion debate in El Salvador . In a 3-1 vote, the justices ruled the risk to Beatriz's life was not imminent but a possibility in the future. ""This court finds that the rights of the mother cannot be prioritized over those of the (fetus) nor vice versa,"" the ruling said. The ruling found that doctors must continue to monitor the woman and make the best medical decisions that take into account the risks to her life, and to the unborn baby, too. Beatriz is suffering from lupus and kidney problems, and her unborn child developed without parts of the brain or skull. She asked for an abortion so that doctors could focus on saving her life, but doctors were hesitant to carry out the procedure without assurances that they wouldn't be prosecuted, her attorneys said. Doctors said they expect the baby to survive only for hours after birth. She argued that an abortion could save her life and allow her to care for her other child, who is a year old. Anti-abortion groups countered that abortion-rights advocates were using Beatriz as an opening to push for changes to abortion laws. ""The constitution makes it clear that life exists from the moment of conception, and anything that tries to end a life is murder,"" lawmaker Rodolfo Parker said after the ruling. Women's rights groups who have held rallies in support of Beatriz said they were disappointed by the ruling and criticized the high court for taking weeks to reach a decision. ""There has to be a prudent period (to make a decision) that doesn't take practically a month and a half like we waited to have a serious analysis,"" said Ima Guirola of the rights group CEMUJER. The court's decision is not the end of the Beatriz's options. Her family has said she is considering traveling outside the country to a place where an abortion can be carried out legally. Journalist Merlin Delcid contributed to this report from San Salvador. CNN's Mariano Castillo reported and wrote in Atlanta.","El Salvador's Supreme Court said doctors cannot perform an abortion on a sick woman .

"(CNN) -- They smell bad, can't talk and generally possess a single-minded hunger for human flesh. Jesse Eisenberg is pursued by zombies in the new release ""Zombieland."" So why, exactly, do we love zombies so much? According to experts -- and, yes, there are zombie experts -- it's because for all their limitations, the brain-rotted, animated corpses are so darned versatile -- helping reflect whatever our greatest fears happen to be at the time. ""You can't shoot the financial meltdown in the head -- you can do that with a zombie,"" said Max Brooks, author of the best-selling ""Zombie Survival Guide"" and ""World War Z"" -- which is currently in development to become a movie.  Watch clips from some essential zombie movies » . ""All the other problems are too big. As much as Al Gore tries, you can't picture global warming. You can't picture the meltdown of our financial institutions. But you can picture a slouching zombie coming down the street."" Zombies initially shuffled onscreen in 1932 as the mindless minions of horror movie legend Bela Lugosi in the film ""White Zombie."" This weekend, they'll chase a shotgun-and-banjo-toting Woody Harrelson through an amusement park when ""Zombieland"" opens. They've also starred in video games, music videos, pop songs and books, picking up a devoted, if not obsessive, set of fans along the way. Since ancient times, monster stories have been used to channel other concerns about life and death, said Andrea Wood, a graduate fellow at Georgia Tech who teaches the course ""Apocalyptic Nightmares of the Living Dead"" and is working on a book about zombies in popular culture. But the zombie, she said, offers a uniquely blank canvas. ""Since the zombie doesn't have the long literary tradition of the vampire or a number of other monsters, it allows artists a degree of autonomy to conceptualize the zombie any way they see fit,"" said Wood. Early zombie films like ""White Zombie"" and 1943's ""I Walked With a Zombie"" stick to the monster's Caribbean voodoo traditions, in which some sort of evildoer uses magic to force the recently deceased to do his bidding. It's no coincidence, says Peter Dendle, an associate professor of English at Pennsylvania State University-Mont Alto, that such stories emerged during the Great Depression. ""The United States that prided itself on individuality and hard work found itself standing in soup lines,"" said Dendle, author of ""The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia"" and other works about the undead. ""The terror in Haiti is not so much being attacked by a zombie, but becoming one -- having your life and soul taken from you and placed under someone else's will."" In 1968, director George A. Romero re-imagined the monsters as flesh-eating ghouls, creating the pop-culture zombie identity that exists to this day. In the turbulent late '60s, Romero's zombies helped provide some thinly veiled commentary on race, class and the breakdown of the American Dream. Since then, zombie movies have given viewers a way to consider, if indirectly, problems such as natural disasters, technology gone awry, deadly viruses and the daily grind of their own lives. Nervous about warfare and military secrets? Wait until they unleash a poisonous nerve gas in ""Planet Terror."" Think animal-rights activists go too far? Watch them rescue and release a monkey that spreads the ""Rage"" virus in ""28 Days Later."" And then there's one of the most basic human fears of all, the fear of death. ""[With zombies] we see the process of decay as it happens right before our eyes,"" Wood said. ""They are this kind of perverse manifestation of humans' desire for immortality gone horribly awry."" Brooks, whose third book, the graphic novel ""Zombie Survival Guide: Recorded Attacks,"" will be released Wednesday, said zombies provide a safe and socially acceptable way to deal with those fears. ""It's safe to do something like a zombie walk -- it isn't so fun to do a swine flu walk,"" Brooks said. ""If, at a party, you bring up how you'd survive a zombie attack, you'd be the life of the party. But if you say, 'What would you do if super-AIDS came to America?' you'd clear the room."" Throughout their history, zombie movies have tended to be low-budget affairs. The highest-grossing zombie movie was the 2004 remake of Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead,"" which hauled in about $59 million. That put the film at No. 92 on Horror.com's list of 100 top-grossing horror movies. But the films often achieve cult-classic status, with fans continuing to watch them decades after they're released. Whether ""Zombieland,"" with its big budget and high-profile cast, breaks that trend, nobody is expecting tales of the walking dead to ever go away. ""In the early 2000s, I had all but pronounced the genre dead -- there hadn't been a big studio movie in more than 10 years,"" he said. ""I've gone out of that business. I've pulled up my shingle for pronouncing the death knell of the zombie."" After all, like zombies, zombie movies are remarkably resilient (even when faced with shotguns and chainsaws). That's another part of the appeal, experts say -- appeal that can be measured in such things as a 74,000-member Facebook group titled ""The Hardest Part of a Zombie Apocalypse Will Be Pretending I'm Not Excited."" To promote his books, Brooks travels the country talking about the undead menace. Instead of questions about writing, he said he often gets asked about the best type of ammunition to kill a zombie or the best way to prepare your house for the coming onslaught. ""I'd say 90 percent are saying, 'We all know it's fake; we're playing along,' "" he said. ""The other 10 percent are saying, 'We're ready!' ""And I'd say 10 percent of that 10 percent can't wait for it to happen.""","It's cool to be ghoul again -- ""Zombieland"" is coming to get you on Friday .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Jim Riches, who lost his son Jimmy -- a New York firefighter -- on September 11, 2001, seems cautiously optimistic that the men again charged in the deadly attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people will finally go to trial. ""Eleven years later and the families are still awaiting justice,"" he told CNN. ""Hopefully, the trial will move forward. Let the world see what these men are like."" Riches is among the victims' relatives notified that terrorism charges were refiled Wednesday against accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Ramzi Bin al-Shibh and three others. If convicted, the men could face the death penalty. They were first charged in 2008, but their cases were suspended when the Obama administration attempted to move the case to federal court in New York, only to run into a political firestorm. In 2009, Riches made a trip to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where the defendants are being held, in an effort to watch and hear them speak before a military commission. ""I am the mastermind of 9/11, not Osama bin Laden,"" Mohammed told the presiding judge. ""We don't care about capital punishment or a life sentence. We are doing jihad for the cause of God."" Riches said Mohammed seemed proud. Riches said he would like to attend a new trial, but isn't sure whether his name will be chosen since other families who haven't been to the naval base will be asked to attend. ""Some families might not want to go. Seeing these evil men isn't easy,"" he said. ""It's very hard to listen to them."" But he said that while he's skeptical, he's also hopeful that this time a trial will take place. President Barack Obama, who has yet to make good on a pledge to close the detention camp, earned congressional scorn after vowing to move high-level detainees to stand trial in civilian courts. The move was followed by an outcry fueled mainly by conservatives who claimed that it would be an unnecessary security risk to move terror suspects from the island facility. The Obama administration countered that federal prosecutions had a record of success, including convictions and life sentences for so-called shoe bomber Richard Reid, confessed al Qaeda operative Zacarias Moussaoui and blind Egyptian cleric Omar Abdel Rahman, who is serving a life sentence for inspiring the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and for a thwarted plot to attack other New York locations. ""Politics had a lot to do with this,"" Riches said. ""The victims of 9/11 are being victimized all over again because of this. And now, we're back to where we were four years ago. Politicians should be ashamed of themselves."" He says families have waited too long to see the 9/11 alleged conspirators stand trial. ""For me, I can't wait for the day justice is served on them,"" he added. ""I want the world to see it."" Riches said the government has already asked him whether he'd be willing to face Mohammed and his co-defendants in court and make a victim impact statement. ""Of course,"" he said. But, ""It doesn't change anything because (his son) won't come walking back into the room.""","Jim Riches lost his son Jimmy -- a New York firefighter -- on September 11, 2001 .

"(CNN) -- Alvaro Bautista will start a MotoGP race from first on the grid for the first time in his short top-level career after outshining motorcycling's big names in qualifying for Sunday's British Grand Prix. The 27-year-old gave the San Carlo Honda Gresini team its first pole position since the late Marco Simoncelli topped the timesheets at Assen just over a year ago. The Spaniard, whose best race finish is fifth since his debut in motorcycling's elite class in 2010, headed off Yamaha's American rider Ben Spies and Repsol Honda's world champion Casey Stoner at Silverstone on Saturday. It is the first time since that Dutch race last June that pole has not been won by Stoner, Jorge Lorenzo or Dani Pedrosa . ""I'm really happy for myself and also pleased for the team. This pole position hasn't happened by coincidence -- it is the fruit of a lot of hard work from all the guys who have all been giving 100% and sometimes a little more,"" Bautista. ""The conditions today were strange and difficult but we managed to find a good setting, I was up front for the whole session and set my fastest lap on my own. ""It started to rain for the last few minutes and nobody was able to improve their time but I still had a fresh tire to use and made a couple of mistakes on my best lap, so could have gone faster too.

"(CNN) -- Formula One's 12 teams have struck an agreement to secure the future of the sport until 2020, Bernie Ecclestone has exclusively told CNN. The F1 CEO revealed a new eight-year deal that will bind all 12 constructors in the elite division of motorsport beyond the current ""Concorde Agreement"" that expires at the end of this season. The contract outlines the terms by which teams compete in Formula One and how the lucrative prize money and television revenues on offer are divided. Progress on the deal has been complicated by F1's planned public offering on the Singapore stock market that could yield around $3 billion. Vettel: Monaco no place for 'sissies' In March the majority of the teams had agreed in principle to tie themselves to an extension of the Concorde Agreement that was most recently signed in 2009, but doubts remained over Mercedes. The German constructor, who have seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher in their ranks, were reported to be considering quitting the sport but during an interview in Monaco, Ecclestone said an agreement had been reached. ""Well we've just got people now, all the current teams, to sign up until 2020 and then I hope another 10 years after that and then forever. Everybody has agreed with it,"" he told CNN World Sport anchor Amanda Davies. ""You'll have to wait to see if Mercedes have but I'm confident everything with Mercedes will be fine,"" Ecclestone added. When asked if his concerns about Mercedes pulling out of the sport had gone he replied: ""Absolutely."" Should F1 be so unpredictable? The Concorde Agreement is between Formula One's governing body, the FIA, the sport's rights holders and the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA). High-profile teams Red Bull, for whom double world champion Sebastian Vettel drives, and iconic constructor Ferrari have recently withdrawn from FOTA, adding complications to the negotiation process. Mercedes were said to be seeking clarification of their part in F1's future plans, insisting on a more prominent role than offered having been a part of the sport since the 1950s. The iconic Silver Arrow version of the Mercedes led the team to back-to-back championships in the 1950s and immortalized the car in motorsport's history. And they were said to be threatening to withdraw from the sport altogether but Ecclestone's revelation signals a breakthrough in discussions and an end in sight to a saga that had threatened to rumble on through the current season. ""I appreciate and support Mercedes probably more than anyone in F1,"" said Ecclestone. ""But the way it was done was on results and we couldn't falsify the results because if we did other people would complain."" Ecclestone also suggested that reports of Formula One listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange might be premature. ""The market doesn't look too bright after that little bit of a problem with Facebook,"" said Ecclestone, referring to the social networking website's recent public offering.

"(CNN) -- An uncle of President Barack Obama who was arrested last month for allegedly operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol has been released from custody.

"(CNN) -- Three suspected terrorists arrested last week in what Spanish officials call one of their largest operations against al Qaeda appear to have been interested in targeting a Gibraltar shopping mall. Spanish security services suspect their plan may have been to attack the British territory on the southernmost tip of Spain from the air. While their planned date of attack is still not clear, any attack on British soil during the Olympic Games would have generated intense global publicity. A paragliding instructor told police Saturday that Cengiz Yalcin, the alleged cell's Turkish facilitator, requested to be able to take pictures of a Gibraltar shopping mall ""at all cost,"" said Fernando Reinares, a senior international terrorism analyst who was briefed by Spanish security services on the investigation. Yalcin, who worked as an engineer at a contruction company on Gibraltar, was arrested in La LÃ­nea de la ConcepciÃ³n, a town bordering Gibraltar. He had lived in Spain with his Moroccan wife for several years. Explosives were found in his residence, as well as videos and photos suggesting the possibility of attack preparations, Reinares said. Spanish security suspect the cell was testing a remote-controlled plane as a potential bomber. Spanish investigators found a video in which Yalcin was flying a remote-controlled airplane, according to Reinares. The footage showed the plane, which was about three meters long. being maneuvered into a descent. Two packets were then seen dropping from either wing of the plane following his command. ""In the images he can't help expressing his joy for the successful try,"" Reinares told CNN. ""Terrorist innovate and adapt to security measures, we have to always keep this in mind,"" he added. It is not the first time that terrorists have sought to use remote controlled aircraft in terrorist plots. In July Rezwan Ferdaus, a Massachusetts resident inspired by al Qaeda's ideology, pleaded guilty to a September 2011 plot to fly a remote-controlled plane into the Pentagon and U.S. capitol with high explosive. Two Chechen-Russians -- Eldar Magomedov (also known as Ahmad Avar) and Muhammad Adamov -- whom Spanish security services suspect had been tasked with carrying out an attack, were arrested on a bus travelling towards France. Investigating Judge Judge Pablo Ruz ruled Sunday there was sufficient evidence to unconditionally detain both men. They were charged with membership in a terrorist group and possession or storage of explosives. Yalcin stands accused of possession of explosives substances. According to a statement released Sunday from Ruz, the Chechens hid their true identity after they were arrested, but Spanish authorities were able to establish their real names after help from Russian authorities. The judge noted that U.S. authorities and Gibraltar law enforcement also assisted the Spanish investigation. The arrests were announced Thursday. Experts say the men appear to have constituted one of the most skilled and experienced terror cells seen in recent times, and appear to have been dispatched by al Qaeda to carry out an ambitious attack in Europe. Magomedov, the suspected leader, was a former member of Spetsnaz, the Russian special forces, according to Spain's Interior Ministry. He had training as a sniper and was an expert in poisons, the ministry said. Reinares, of Madrid's Elcano Royal Institute, said that according to information passed to Spain by several Western intelligence agencies, Megomedov joined training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan, including camps run by Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, after leaving the Russian special forces outfits. According to this intelligence, between 2008 and 2011 Megomedov operated in the southwestern Russian republic of Dagestan and the Pakistani tribal districts of North and South Waziristan, transiting between them, Reinares told CNN. Adamov, the other Chechen, had received explosives training in Afghanistan, where he become an expert in managing explosives and may have participated in a recent bomb attack in Moscow, according to Spanish authorities. According to Reinares, the French described the Chechens to their Spanish counterparts as ""really dangerous."" He said British intelligence services were also involved in tracking the suspected terrorist cell. Also found in Yalcin's home was equipment for three motorized paragliding machines. Yalcin told a Spanish investigating judge Friday that he was an enthusiast of motorized paragliding and wished to teach his two Chechen associates how to fly them. Reinares said Spanish security services have established that both Chechens received motor-paragliding lessons near La Linea and may have had some instruction before arriving in Spain. A paragliding hand book in Russian was found in their possession, Reinares said. Yalcin, the Turkish suspect, was ordered detained immediately after his arrest. Because information obtained by intelligence agencies is generally not admissable in Spanish courts, Spanish police and security services had scramble in the past few days to provide sufficient evidence to bring a case, according to Reinares. French security services tipped off their Spanish counterparts about the probable arrival of the two Chechen suspected terrorists in May, according to Reinares. The French had been tracking the duo and monitoring their phone calls. At one point, they intercepted a phone call in which the Chechens described Spain as a ""more easy country to get explosives,"" Reinares said. Investigators moved to arrest all three men after the two Chechens appeared to be heading back to France by bus, concerned that France may be their target. One of them violently resisted arrest, the Spanish Interior Ministry reported. But police were frustrated by a judge's refusal to grant an immediate search warrant for Yalcin's apartment after his arrest, according to Reinares. Investigators feared that may have given the cell time to dispose of additional explosives, he said. It took eight to nine hours for the search warrant to be granted. Police then drove with Yalcin and an official of the Spanish judiciary to his residence. According to the subsequent judicial report, his wife greeted him by saying ""do not worry, honey, I cleaned it all."" The agents wrote they noticed a ""very strong smell of bleach when moving into the place,"" the report said. Reinares said French security services had asked their Spanish counterparts not to share intelligence on the suspected cell with the Spanish judiciary, fearing that open exposure of such information in court -- as required by Spanish law -- could blow the whole operation. Dog teams used in the search suggested that more explosives had been present than police found, according to Reinares. Spanish security services believe another target of the alleged terrorist cell may have been a joint U.S.-Spanish naval base in Rota, Spain, near where they were based, and have not ruled out other possible targets in Europe. ""The case definetely stresses, once again, how critical cooperation between Western nations is to successfully prevent and combat international terrorism,"" Reinares told CNN. Journalist Javier Ruiz Perez contributed to this report for CNN from Madrid.","Analyst says a suspect wanted to photograph a Gibraltar mall from the air .

"Framingham, Massachusetts (CNN) -- If Sarah Sellers' warnings had been taken seriously 10 years ago, 12 people might be alive today. Sellers, a pharmacist and expert on the sterile compounding of drugs, testified to Congress in 2003 about non-sterile conditions she'd witnessed. ""Professional standards for sterile compounding have not been consistently applied,"" she told the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. ""The absence of federal compounding regulations has created vulnerability in our gold standard system for pharmaceutical regulation."" Nearly 10 years later, there are still no federal sterility guidelines for compounding pharmacies that make and distribute drugs all over the country. Now, 137 cases and 12 fatalities nationwide are blamed on a rare, noncontagious form of meningitis linked to contaminated steroid injections made by the Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center. The latest death to be connected to the outbreak was that of a 70-year-old man who died in Florida in July, prior to the discovery of the contamination. Tennessee is the hardest-hit state, with 39 infections and six deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Three deaths occurred in Michigan and one each in Maryland and Virginia, the CDC said. Patients contracted the deadly meningitis after being injected in their spines with a preservative-free steroid called methylprednisolone acetate that was contaminated by a fungus. The steroid is used to treat pain and inflammation. As many as 13,000 people may have received the medicine between May 21 and September 24, the CDC said. The New England Compounding Center announced Wednesday it has established a recall operations center to manage the removal of all its products from circulation. Last week, the pharmacy voluntarily surrendered its license to operate until the Food and Drug Administration's investigation into the contamination is complete. Health officials say 75 medical facilities in 23 states received the contaminated steroid injections from NECC. At least two lawmakers are introducing bills to strengthen the FDA's oversight of compounding pharmacies. ""Unfortunately, compounding pharmacies are a 19th century service operating in a 21st century industry, and we need to update and strengthen the rules that govern these operations so that patients can safely benefit from the unique service they offer,"" Rep. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, said in a statement. ""I look forward to working with my colleagues to introduce this legislation and to ensure FDA has the authority it needs to oversee these pharmacies and protect patients."" Meningitis outbreak: Your questions answered . Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, vowed similar action. ""This outbreak and the corresponding recall of products from the New England Compounding Center expose dramatic gaps in our drug safety standards that create an unnecessary risk to the public health,"" she wrote in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. While compounding pharmacies were intended to create customized medications for specific patients, some ""have evolved into large scale operations that produce sizeable quantities of some drugs,"" she wrote. ""For example, cases in the current outbreak are spread across nine states and more than 17,500 doses of the potentially contaminated drug were shipped to 23 states. At the same time, the FDA lacks clear authority for ensuring the safety of these products and last updated its guidance for (the) industry in 2002."" The FDA has been working on new guidelines since at least 2006, but the effort is ""still in progress,"" FDA spokeswoman Erica Jefferson said. Currently, the FDA does not have jurisdiction over compounding pharmacies until there is a problem. FDA officials say they have been fighting to change that for more than 20 years. The compounding pharmacy industry has challenged those efforts, and courts have ruled that individual state health departments are in charge. ""These facilities are inspected upon initial licensure and in response to complaints,"" said Alec Loftus of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. One woman's fight for compounding pharmacy guidelines . Massachusetts requires compound pharmacies to be licensed by the state board, but does not require accreditation. That's a voluntary process that only 162 out of 3,000 compounding facilities have obtained, according to the Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board. ""The oversight appears to be quite lax,"" said CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, reporting from Massachusetts about the contaminated drugs. The New England Compounding Center ""can distribute thousands of doses of drugs and it doesn't necessarily have to be accredited."" The center's building in Framingham is also home to a garbage compactor and recycling center. CNN observed a medical waste truck making a drop, as well as piles of garbage, boxes, and old mattresses on the back side of the pharmacy compound building. Both companies are owned by the same people. If the site had been accredited, officials would have examined the facilities and considered whether there are concerns about the site sharing space with a garbage facility, Gupta said. ""Our investigation into NECC and the outbreak with our partners in Massachusetts are ongoing, so I can't comment directly on how this factors in,"" said Jefferson, the FDA spokeswoman. There is no law that specifies a minimum proximity between a compounding pharmacy and other establishments. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has warned the NECC multiple times since 2002 about unsanitary conditions at its facility. Statutory and regulatory requirements stipulate that compounding can be done only on receipt of a patient-specific prescription, Dr. Madeleine Biondolillo, director of the department's Bureau of Healthcare Safety and Quality, told reporters Wednesday. Asked if there had been a violation, she said some organizations may have operated contrary to the licensing regulations, but that is part of the investigation. Compounding pharmacies were originally created for doctors or pharmacists to make small amounts of custom medications -- for example, adding flavored syrup to a cough medicine, or creating a smaller dose for an individual patient if it's not created commercially. They've grown into a much larger business. Pharmacy compounding accounts for 37 million prescription drugs in the United States each year. Some compounders ship thousands of custom drugs all over the country. NECC is licensed to distribute to surgery centers and pain clinics in 50 states. Nearly 10% of drugs administered in the United States come from compound pharmacies, according to a 2003 Government Accountability Office report. Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is usually caused by an infection, frequently with bacteria or a virus, but it can also be caused by less common pathogens, such as fungi in this case, according to the CDC. Fungal meningitis is very rare and, unlike viral and bacterial meningitis, is not contagious. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told CNN that fungal infections are not usually mild. He said when a fungus invades small blood vessels, it can cause them to clot or bleed, which can lead to symptoms of small strokes. In addition to typical meningitis symptoms like headache, fever, nausea and stiffness of the neck, people with fungal meningitis may also experience confusion, dizziness and discomfort from bright lights. Patients might just have one or two of these symptoms, the CDC says. Health officials say any patients who received an injection at one of the facilities beginning May 21 and who began showing symptoms between one and three weeks after being injected should see their doctor right away. The earlier a patient gets treatment, the more likely he or she will survive. Patients are treated with anti-fungal medication, which is given intravenously, so patients have to be admitted to the hospital, the CDC said. Patients may need to be treated for months. The FDA is urging anyone who has experienced problems following an injection with the NECC product to report it to MedWatch, the FDA's voluntary reporting program, by phone at 1-800-FDA-1088 or online at www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm. CNN's Danielle Dellorto reported from Framingham; CNN's Elizabeth Cohen and William Hudson reported from Atlanta.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- For years, political scientists assumed our political leanings came from the way we were raised and the company we keep. You're a screaming liberal? Must be because you were raised in a household full of screaming liberals. You're an arch conservative? Must be because of that college you went to. Experts are studying the theory that political leanings are related to the way individuals process information. But slowly, some political scientists are beginning to change their minds on what shapes our political views. They're starting to wonder whether some of our political identity is rooted in our DNA. The theory goes something like this: Choosing a political point of view involves thinking through issues: Will more lax immigration rules put the U.S. at risk? Will tighter gun-control laws help lower the murder rate? Many scientists believe how our brains work is influenced by our genes -- that to some extent we're hard-wired from birth to process information in a certain way. This doesn't mean, these scientists say, genes dictate how we think; environment clearly plays a huge role. Nor does it mean there's a Republican gene or a Democrat gene. Scientists who espouse the genetics-politics connection say that probably hundreds of genes influence how we think and how we see the world.  Watch more about how your genes can influence how you vote. » . ""Political tendencies are like being left-handed or right-handed -- you're born feeling more natural using one hand or the other,"" says John Alford, a political scientist at Rice University. ""It doesn't mean you can't switch -- for many years lefties were taught to be righties. But it's not easy."" It's a classic dispute of nature versus nurture, and it was Alford's study on nearly 10,000 twins that started the debate three years ago. The study showed identical twins, who share all the same genes, are more likely to share political views than fraternal twins, who share only about 50 percent of their genes. After Alford's study, scientists set out to see whether brains of liberals and conservatives look any different. In one study, researchers at New York University and UCLA asked 43 study subjects to assess, on this scale  if they were liberal or conservative. They then strapped electrodes on the subjects and had them play a game on the computer game. In a study published last year in the journal Nature Neuroscience, the researchers found that liberals and conservatives processed information differently. Specifically, they found differences in activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain that processes conflicting information. David Amodio, an assistant professor of psychology at New York University, and lead author of the study, says these results suggest that liberals and conservatives have some basic brain differences -- and those differences are influenced by our genetic makeup. ""People used to think political attitudes were influenced only by our culture and our environment,"" he says. ""Now we realize political attitudes are influenced by genes in interaction with the environment."" Political scientist James Fowler at the University of California, San Diego, puts it this way: ""What we are discovering is that nature is just as important as nurture when it comes to political behavior."" Our genes may influence not just our political point of view, but also whether we vote at all. In a study recently accepted by The Journal of Politics, Fowler found people with one version of a gene called MAOA were 1.3 times more likely to vote than those with a different version. In addition, members of religious groups who carried a particular version of another gene called 5HTT were 60 percent more likely to vote than members of religious groups with a different version of the gene. The science of genes and politics is not without its critics. Some say there's absolutely no proof that our political views are embedded in our DNA. ""These are very facile studies that make outrageous claims,"" says Evan Charney, a political scientist at Duke University. ""They're trying to make political science into a science, when really it's not."" For example, he says identical twins might have more similar political views than fraternal twins because they were raised ""as if they were one unit. They're dressed in the same clothes and given names that rhyme."" Alford, who did the twins study, disagrees. He says genes do make a difference, and he hopes the genes-politics research will help increase tolerance for people with different political views. ""Maybe we'll all just accept that people are built to see the world differently,"" he says. ""There isn't one correct way to be. It's just the way you are."" E-mail to a friend .

"Washington (CNN) -- The State Department's former point man on security in Libya told a congressional hearing Wednesday that his superiors worked against him as he tried to get more help for the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi in the months before it was overrun in a deadly terror attack. Eric Nordstrom, the one-time regional security officer, told the House Oversight Committee that he had a disheartening conversation with the regional director of the agency's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs when he requested additional manpower for the facility. ""I said, 'Jim, you know what makes it most frustrating about this assignment? It's not the hardships. It's not the gunfire. It's not the threats. It's dealing and fighting against the people, programs, and personnel who are supposed to be supporting me,"" Nordstrom said. He also told the State Department officer, ""'For me, the Taliban is on the inside of the building."" That bombshell ended a contentious hearing during which two State Department officials defended the Obama administration's handling of the September 11 attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. What we know about the Libya attack . Benghazi has become a flashpoint in the presidential campaign with Republican Mitt Romney saying the attack illustrates that President Barack Obama's policies have made America less influential and more vulnerable around the world. Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy responded to suggestions the State Department was responsible for a lack of preparedness. ""We regularly assess risk and resource allocation, a process involving the considered judgments of experienced professionals on the ground and in Washington, using the best available information,"" Kennedy said. The assault on the U.S. compound was ""an unprecedented attack by dozens of heavily armed men,"" Kennedy said. His colleague, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Programs Charlene Lamb, added that the State Department ""had the correct number of assets in Benghazi at the time,"" drawing a sharp rebuke from committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California. ""To start off by saying you had the correct number, and our ambassador and three other individuals are dead, and people are in the hospital recovering because it only took moments to breach that facility somehow doesn't seem to ring true to the American people,"" Issa said. Republican committee members and the State Department officials went back and forth about the appropriate number of people needed to provide security at the vulnerable Benghazi location. Various communications dating back nearly a year asked for anywhere from three to five diplomatic security special agents. As the four-hour hearing drew to a close, Nordstrom divulged he had verbally asked for significantly more help -- 12 agents -- but the officer from the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs had rebuffed his request. ""His response to that was, 'You're asking for the sun, moon, and the stars,'"" Nordstrom said. That attitude made the Benghazi incident predictable, according to Nordstrom, who left Libya in July and continues to work at the State Department for diplomatic security. ""For me and my staff, it was abundantly clear that we were not going to get resources until the aftermath of an incident. And the question that we were to ask again is, 'How thin does the ice have to get before someone falls through?'"" Five special agents were in Benghazi at the time of the attack, Issa said. Two of them only happened to be there only because they had traveled with Stevens from Tripoli, Lamb said. ""The post had agreed that three was a sufficient number to have on the ground."" Lamb said. But Lt. Col. Andrew Wood, a Utah National Guardsman who was a site security commander in Libya from February through August, testified that the regional security officer -- it was unclear if he was talking about Nordstrom -- tried to obtain additional personnel, but ""was never able to attain the numbers he felt comfortable with."" ""The security in Benghazi was a struggle and remained a struggle throughout my time there,"" Wood said. ""Diplomatic security remained weak. In April, there was only one U.S. diplomatic security agent there."" U.S. official sought more security for Benghazi post . State Department officials also responded to allegations by Republicans that the Obama administration intentionally misled the public about the cause of the attack. Critics accuse the administration of trying to cover up or play down the attack through initial statements that described it as a spontaneous act stemming from protests over an anti-Muslim film rather than a planned terrorist assault. ""We have always made clear that we are giving the best information we have at the time. And that information has evolved,"" Kennedy said, citing remarks by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice on September 16 that critics alleged were deceptive. ""For example, if any administration official, including any career official, were on television on Sunday, September 16, they would have said what Ambassador Rice said. The information she had at that point from the intelligence community is the same that I had at that point. Clearly, we know more about today than what we did."" While congressmen from both parties agreed that security at overseas U.S. diplomatic posts is crucial, and they expressed hope for a bipartisan solution, several times during the hearing the dialogue devolved into rancorous comments back and forth. The assault in Benghazi occurred 11 years to the day after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York's World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Kennedy said the fullest picture of proper security and procedures will not be fully clear until a review board appointed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and including former Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen is completed. State Department officials: Benghazi attack 'unprecedented' Democrats had accused Issa of planning a partisan, election-year hearing, a similar allegation leveled against the panel for its past investigations of the botched ""Fast and Furious"" gun-running program and the failed Solyndra clean energy company that received government loan guarantees. On Tuesday, two senior State Department officials provided reporters with the most detailed explanation yet of the attack in Benghazi, saying on a conference call that there was no prior indication such an assault was imminent. The officials, who briefed reporters on condition of not being identified by name, said there was ""nothing unusual"" throughout the day of the attack. What Obama administration has said about Libya attack . Stevens held an evening meeting with a Turkish diplomat and then retired to his room in one of the compound's buildings at 9 p.m., according to the officials. The first sign of a problem came 40 minutes later, when diplomatic security agents heard loud talking outside the compound, along with gunfire and explosions. Asked whether the attack was a spontaneous assault taking advantage of a demonstration, as originally asserted by Obama administration officials, one senior official said, ""That was not our conclusion."" The two senior officials offered riveting detail of the attack by what one of them described as ""dozens of armed men"" who marauded from building to building and later fired mortars on a U.S. annex less than a mile away. In the havoc at the four-building compound, Stevens and two of his security personnel took refuge in a fortified room that the attackers were able to penetrate, one official said. The attackers doused the building with diesel fuel and set it ablaze and the three men decided to leave the safe haven and move to a bathroom to be able to breathe, according to the official. Stevens became separated from the security personnel in the chaos and smoke, and eventually turned up at a Benghazi hospital, where he was declared dead. Romney knew ex-SEAL slain in Benghazi .

"(CNN) -- The Susan G. Komen for the Cure announced Wednesday that two of its leaders are leaving their posts, months after the breast cancer advocacy group came under fire over its decision -- later reversed -- to cut funding for Planned Parenthood projects. Nancy G. Brinker will step down as CEO once her successor is found and take on a new role within the organization, the foundation said in a statement. As chair of the Komen Board Executive Committee, she will focus on revenue creation, strategy and global growth, it said. President Elizabeth Thompson will leave the organization altogether next month, the statement said, adding, ""Thompson said the time is right for her to pursue other opportunities."" Report: Komen misled on mammogram benefits . Brinker told the Wall Street Journal Wednesday that the changes had nothing to do with the firestorm that erupted in January and February, when the foundation made a decision that would have cut funding to Planned Parenthood projects. ""I apologized to everyone,"" Brinker told the newspaper. ""I think we all made mistakes and we addressed them and we're through that and we're moving on."" In 1982, Brinker founded Susan G. Komen for the Cure -- named for her sister who had died from breast cancer two years before. Brinker went on to become a political appointee of the George W. Bush administration, serving as U.S. ambassador to Hungary and as chief of protocol. Thompson, who began her career in medical publishing before turning toward cancer advocacy, was named president of the foundation in September 2010, two years after joining the group to lead its research and scientific programs. Wednesday's announcement comes six months after Karen Handel, a vice president of the organization, resigned in the wake of a Huffington Post report, based on a review of internal e-mails at the foundation, that concluded she had been the driving force behind the foundation's decision not to renew parts of its longstanding partnership with Planned Parenthood. Handel denied that was the case. Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, was a Republican gubernatorial candidate in Georgia in 2010, losing to current Gov. Nathan Deal in a primary runoff. ""Let me be clear, since I am pro-life, I do not support the mission of Planned Parenthood,"" Handel wrote on her campaign website in 2010. Planned Parenthood operates hundreds of family clinics where abortions are performed. When asked in February what role her position on abortion may have played in the decision not to renew funding for Planned Parenthood projects, Handel said: ""Absolutely none."" ""I'm a professional. ... My No. 1 priority is the fight against breast cancer, our mission and the women that we serve. The only place for politics in all of this came from Planned Parenthood, when they launched this vicious, vicious attack on a great organization and perpetrated what was nothing short of a shakedown to coerce a private entity to give them grants,"" she told CNN affiliate WXIA in Atlanta. ""It's abundantly clear that this was never about the fight against breast cancer for Planned Parenthood. What it was about, and remains about, is the fight to advance Planned Parenthood's agenda, and they sucked Komen in the middle of it and used them in all of this. And it's a disgrace,"" Handel said. After encountering a deluge of opposition, the Komen foundation reversed its decision. On Wednesday, the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America praised Brinker, Thompson and the Komen Foundation. They ""have made profound contributions to women's health,"" said Cecile Richards, in a statement. ""They have helped elevate the importance of breast cancer detection and prevention nationwide.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Car owners who have replaced a vehicle's airbag in the past three years, take note: That new airbag could be an unsafe fake. Federal officials on Wednesday warned motorists and auto shops that counterfeit airbags pose a danger to consumers, saying the bags could fail to deploy or even hurt people in car wrecks. Concerns over counterfeit airbags heightened last month when authorities tested 10 fake airbags seized as part of a criminal investigation. All 10 failed, authorities said. Some failed to inflate, others partially inflated and one exploded, showering the crash test dummy with metal shrapnel. To date, there are no known injuries or deaths resulting from the counterfeits, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said. But officials said they fear the counterfeits could hurt motorists and passengers if they go undetected. ""These seemingly genuine airbags are in fact shoddy fakes,"" said John Morton, director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which seized 2,500 counterfeit airbags during fiscal 2012. ""These airbags don't work. They're not going to save you in an accident. They are a fraud and a danger from start to finish, and you don't want them in your car, period."" Officials cautioned that only a small fraction of all cars -- estimated at 0.1% -- have the counterfeit airbags. ""They are good fakes. They look like the real thing,"" said David Strickland, administrator of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. ""And frankly, a consumer is not going to be in a position to figure out whether they have a fake or a real airbag."" The agency said the following people may be most at risk: . -- Those who have had airbags replaced in the past three years at a repair shop that is not part of a new car dealership. -- Those who have purchased a used car but are not familiar with its history. -- Those who own a car with a title branded salvage, rebuilt or reconstructed. -- Those who have purchased replacement airbags over the Internet, especially at unusually low prices, such as less than $400. If motorists suspect they may have a counterfeit airbag, they should contact call centers established by car manufacturers to have their vehicles inspected. A list of call centers is available at www.SaferCar.gov. Government and industry officials noted that consumers will bear the cost of inspections. ""The bad actors here are the counterfeiters,"" said A. Bailey Wood Jr., a spokesman for the National Automobile Dealers Association. Wood estimated the cost of inspecting airbags at between $100 and $200, and the cost of replacing a steering wheel airbag at between $750 and $1,000. ""And some cars have eight airbags,"" he said. Strickland said his agency is working with automakers to develop a system to verify authentic replacement parts and to raise awareness of the potential risks of counterfeit parts. Morton said earlier this year that customs agents arrested a Chinese broker selling nine brands of counterfeit airbags in the United States. That broker has been convicted and is in prison, Morton said, and multiple investigations into other brokers are continuing.","Counterfeit airbags have been sold as replacements for U.S. cars .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York hardware clerk pleaded guilty Thursday to second degree murder and kidnapping in the second degree, after abducting, smothering and dismembering an 8-year-old Brooklyn boy in the Hasidic Jewish enclave of Borough Park. Judge Neil Firetog said Levi Aron accepted a plea deal and will spend 40 years to life behind bars for the two counts, after the official sentencing on August 29, for the killing of Leiby Kletzky last summer. Aron's attorney, Jennifer L. McCann, said she was ""glad we were able to come up with an amenable resolution that both sides agreed to."" ""I know this has been a very difficult case for all of Brooklyn, and I appreciate the patience,"" she said. ""In these kinds of cases, people have rights. And we had to make sure to do our do diligence in resolving the case."" Police say Leiby's dismembered body was found in Aron's freezer and inside a suitcase in a nearby trash bin. New York City's chief medical examiner said the Brooklyn boy died last summer after being drugged and then smothered. The autopsy results for Leiby listed a cocktail of four prescription and over-the-counter drugs in the boy's system: cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant; quetiapine, an antipsychotic drug; hydrocodone, a pain medication; and acetaminophen, the drug found in Tylenol. Both Aron and Leiby were members of the borough's close-knit Orthodox Jewish community, although police say it doesn't appear that they knew each other. Kletzky's family released a statement through New York Assemblyman Dov Hikind's office, saying they have ""finally received some partial closure on one aspect of this nightmare."" ""There is no way one can comprehend or understand the pain of losing a child,"" said Nachman and Esther Kletzky in the statement. ""Closure does not mean we don't continue to feel the pain. A day doesn't pass without our thinking of Leiby -- but today we close the door on this one aspect of our tragedy and seek to remember only the gifts that G-d has bestowed.""

"Moscow (CNN) -- Only hours after she was freed from prison Wednesday, Pussy Riot member Yekaterina Samutsevich vowed to continue the kind of political protest act that led to her imprisonment this summer for ""hooliganism"" alongside two fellow band members. The Russian punk band members were sentenced in August for performing a song critical of President Vladimir Putin in one of the Russian Orthodox Church's most important cathedrals in February. Although Samutsevich walked out of the court building Wednesday with a suspended sentence, the court upheld the two-year sentences for Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina. Previously on CNN.com: Two Pussy Riot members flee Russia to 'recruit foreign feminists' But in an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Samutsevich said the punk rock band still has work to do in opposing Putin. ""We are not finished, nor are we going to end our political protest,"" she said. ""The situation in the country has deteriorated since our performance and the trial itself is a testimony to that."" Pussy Riot still exists and will carry out more protest performances, she said, adding that rumors of divisions within the group are unfounded. ""We have to act in such a way that they"" -- meaning Russian authorities -- ""do not learn about concerts ahead of time ... and arrest us,"" she said. She will be ""more cautious"" in her actions going forward, Samutsevich conceded. Meanwhile, her ""negative"" attitude toward Putin and what she calls his ""mega authoritarian project"" remains unchanged, Samutsevich said. She said the band's cathedral protest had been intended as a criticism of the support given by senior members of the Russian Orthodox Church for a third presidential term for Putin. ""We believe that we live in a secular society and in this state, the principles of the secular society should be respected,"" she said. ""The representatives of the church should not interfere with the politics of the country, and we wanted to highlight this problem through our action."" However, the flash mob-style act was in no way an expression of hatred for the church or its believers, she stressed. Footage of the brief but provocative protest action -- in which the band members, their faces shrouded by balaclavas, screamed ""Mother Mary, please drive Putin away"" inside Christ Savior Cathedral -- attracted wide attention after it was posted online. It also outraged many of the country's faithful. The three women, who were arrested shortly after the protest act, were convicted and sentenced for hooliganism. Two other members of the female punk rock band have fled Russia. Samutsevich said the court's decision to release her with a suspended sentence was a big surprise, and she has ""mixed feelings"" about being free after more than six months in custody. ""Of course I am very happy to be out and to be free, but I'm very upset that Nadezhda and Maria are still incarcerated,"" she said. Although Samutsevich is a member of Pussy Riot and was involved in planning the protest act, she was stopped by a guard on her way into the church and so did not perform the ""punk prayer"" song, she said. Public perceptions of private parts: Attitudes on women's bodies . This meant that she could not technically be sentenced for dancing at the altar, as the two others were, apparently leading the court to conclude that her sentence should be suspended. Supporters responded joyfully in the courtroom as her release was announced. Both Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina were very happy for her, Samutsevich said, despite the fact they are expected to serve the remainder of their prison terms in different prisons. Each of them has a young child. They are ""very, very upset"" about being separated from their children, Samutsevich told Amanpour, ""but they are holding up very well."" While in detention, the three young women were held in separate cells with three or four other women, she said. They were kept under close scrutiny and recorded at all times to start with, she said, but suffered no physical abuse. Asked if Pussy Riot's action had made a difference, Samutsevich said she believes it made a lot of people think differently about Putin and his policies. Their trial has also helped expose the flaws in the Russian judicial system and how it is influenced by the opinions of the president, Samutsevich said. Wednesday's court decision came only a week after Samutsevich took on a new legal team for the appeal, saying she wanted to push her defense in a different direction. Speaking outside court, lawyers for Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina said they would try to take their case to the European Court of Human Rights. Rights group Amnesty International said Wednesday's ruling was ""only a half-measure in achieving justice"" for the women, and called for all three to be released immediately and unconditionally. ""Any decision that shortens the wrongful detention of the three women is welcome. But no one should be fooled -- justice has not been done today,"" David Diaz-Jogeix, Amnesty's Europe and Central Asia deputy program director, said in a statement. ""The government has introduced numerous new restrictions to freedom of expression in recent months. As this decision demonstrates, Russia's judiciary is unlikely to offer much protection to those who fall foul of them."" The band's conviction and sentencing garnered an international outcry, with celebrities from Paul McCartney to Anthony Bourdain to Madonna backing the cause of the strident trio. ""Say what you will about Pussy Riot: this might not be your kind of music. Their actions might offend you. But this doesn't change the fact that freedom of expression, in whatever peaceful form it takes, is a human right, and one on which the protection of other rights rests,"" wrote Michelle Ringuette of Amnesty International USA. A judge rejected the women's defense that their actions were politically motivated, ruling that they had intended to insult the Orthodox Church and undermine public order. An Orthodox Church leader has been widely reported as saying Putin's years in power have been a miracle from God. Before the hearing last week, the Russian Orthodox Church appealed for leniency for the band members, according to state-owned Ria Novosti. The church believes repentance will ""benefit the souls"" of the band members, the news agency said. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has called for the members' release but also said he is ""sickened"" by their actions. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark, Alla Eshchenko and Alexander Felton contributed to this report.","NEW: Samutsevich has ""mixed feelings"" about being free while her friends remain in prison .

"Danville, Kentucky (CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan, GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney's running mate, will share the stage in Danville, Kentucky, in their only debate. Biden and Ryan's debate follows the top of the tickets' first of three debates last week, in which Obama turned in a lackluster performance, upstaged by an aggressive and vibrant Romney. Here are five things to watch for on Thursday night: . 1. Will Biden go where Obama didn't? Biden is not shy on the campaign trail; the day after last week's first presidential debate, the vice president attacked Republican nominee Mitt Romney in a way that many Democrats had wished President Barack Obama would have done the night before. King: VP debate no game-changer, but could shift momentum . How aggressive will Biden be in going after the man at the top of the GOP ticket rather than the man he'll share the debate stage with? Will Biden highlight the ""47%"" controversy, Bain Capital and Romney's tax returns? ""The vice president likes laying out the contrast between the Romney-Ryan extreme agenda and the plans he and the president have to move this country forward and we fully expect that to continue Thursday night,"" an Obama campaign official told CNN. With the polls tightening both nationally and in key battleground states after last week's debate, the stakes for the showdown between the running mates have increased. 7 questions you would ask at the VP debate . ""Biden needs to play offense, not defense,"" said Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala, who is a senior adviser for a pro-Obama super PAC. ""Attack the Romney-Ryan plan to cut taxes for the rich and raise them on the middle class. Dissect the Romney-Ryan plan to end Medicare as we know it. Point out that if Romney had been president, Osama bin Laden would be alive and GM would be dead. And be prepared to body-slam Ryan when -- not if -- he fibs."" 2. The wonk trap . Paul Ryan likes to call himself ""a numbers guy."" Indeed, wonky budget talk is Ryan's calling card. It's the primary reason he has captured the hearts of conservative elites in Washington, who see him as the second coming of Jack Kemp. Ryan's debate prep as meticulous as he is . But fiscal wonkery was quicksand for Obama during last week's debate. His dreary reliance on budget math over pointed political arguments contrasted sharply with Mitt Romney, who presented his ideas with vigor and clarity, despite obvious questions about the factual underpinnings of his ideas. Can Ryan avoid getting bogged down in the arithmetic that so thrills him? An adviser to the GOP vice presidential nominee told The National Review's Robert Costa this week that Ryan ""may be over-preparing"" for his showdown with Biden. By some accounts, Ryan has bristled at platitude-driven demands of the campaign trail. He'd rather be talking substance, on the road with a PowerPoint presentation about Medicare costs. The challenge for Ryan on Thursday, though, is to present the Romney vision to millions of voters without sounding too much like the Beltway think tank staffer he once was. He's done a solid job of that since Romney put him on the GOP ticket in August. Now, on the biggest stage of his career, he has to abandon some of the Capitol Hill tendencies that made him a star in the first place. Paul Ryan hasn't called Palin for advice . 3. Will Biden put Social Security in play? In the House, Paul Ryan has backed moving Social Security funds to private investment accounts as a way to make the popular entitlement program more solvent. Ryan's past proposals would seem to tee up what's usually a winning political argument for Democrats: that the Republican ticket wants to gut Social Security to help their old pals on Wall Street. But to the bewilderment of Democratic strategists, Obama appeared to take the issue off the table in the first debate. ""I suspect that on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position,"" Obama said. ""Social Security is structurally sound. It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill. But it is, the basic structure is sound."" CNN Money: Social Security, Where Obama and Romney stand . The Obama campaign scrambled to clarify last week that yes, in fact, the two candidates have fundamentally different views on Social Security. ""The choice is clear: President Obama will never privatize Social Security or undermine retirement security for middle-class Americans,"" read a post on the Obama campaign website that went up after the debate. ""The same cannot be said for Romney."" Will Biden try to score fresh points by raising the issue of Social Security privatization against Ryan? Or did the president already holster one of his party's most effective political attacks? 4. The age gap . ""I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience."" So went Ronald Reagan's famous line in one of his 1984 debates against Democratic challenger Walter Mondale. Will Biden have a similar quip ready on Thursday? OK, Biden is not nearly as old as Reagan, who was 73 at the time of his re-election. But at 69, he has almost three decades on Ryan, his 42-year-old debate opponent. How Ryan sharpens debate skills . Biden is also known for his exuberance and devilish charm, so perhaps the age gap won't be as apparent as it was in 2008, when 47-year-old Barack Obama shared a stage with 72-year-old John McCain. Or as it was in 1988, when 67-year-old Lloyd Bentsen debated his boyish vice presidential foe Dan Quayle. Stylistically, their birthdays might not matter much. But the age difference neatly crystallizes the arguments being presented by both campaigns. Will voters choose experience and decide to move forward on the path we're on? Or will they look to a pair of fresh-faced outsiders who offer a new direction? 5. Ryan's role as commander in chief . Just as Mitt Romney needed to prove last week that he's acceptable to Americans to serve as president, Ryan needs to convey that he's ready to fill in as president in case something happens to Romney. It's one of the top tasks for the challenger's running mate in a vice presidential debate. We'll be keeping a close watch on Ryan to see if he touts his ability to step in, if needed, to the leading role. The Romney campaign is confident that the congressman from Wisconsin will pass the test, thanks to Ryan's position as House budget chairman and his mastery of complex fiscal issues. ""It will come down to his competency on the issues, his command of the issues,"" a Romney campaign official told CNN. But Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos thinks that this time around, passing the competency test is not as important. ""There is very little pressure for either of these vice presidential candidates to prove they are ready to step into the office of president. Both their bosses are relatively young and in great health,"" Castellanos said. Opinion: Biden must deliver for Team Obama . What questions would you ask the VP candidates? Share with us on CNN iReport .","Will Biden use the issues Obama avoided last week to take the fight to Ryan?

"Hefei, China (CNN) -- The murder trial of Gu Kailai, the wife of a recently deposed top official in the Chinese Communist Party, has begun in the eastern China city of Hefei, local officials said Thursday. Gu and a family aide, Zhang Xiaojun, are accused of poisoning Neil Heywood, a British businessman who was found dead in the southwestern Chinese metropolis of Chongqing in November. The trial is the latest phase in the fall from grace of the prominent family of Bo Xilai, Gu's husband, who until earlier this year had appeared destined to join the elite committee of leaders at the top of China's ruling party. The saga has become the most sensational Chinese political scandal in recent years, creating an extraordinary set of challenges for the central government as it prepares for a once-in-a-decade leadership transition later this year. Heywood, a 41-year-old British citizen, was found dead in a hotel in Chongqing, the city where Bo was the Communist Party chief. But the trial is taking place in Hefei, in Anhui province, more than 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) east of Chongqing, where lingering support for Bo and his family remains. ""This is definitely more than a criminal trial,"" said Wenran Jiang, a professor of political science at the University of Alberta. He added that the process is being closely watched for signs of what might happen to Bo, who is being investigated for ""serious discipline violations"" after being removed from his Chongqing and party posts. Gu's family had wanted to hire two prominent Beijing lawyers to represent her, but Chinese authorities have chosen two local attorneys to form her defense team, a family friend told CNN on Wednesday. The family is sending one of the attorneys -- along with another well-known Beijing attorney -- into the courtroom as observers, with the approval of the court, said the friend, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the case. The cards appear to be stacked against Gu and Zhang, who are at the mercy of a Chinese court system that has been criticized by human rights advocates as being little more than a tool of the country's powerful state security apparatus. ""In this trial, frankly speaking, nobody believes that it's a totally independent judiciary and it will be judged just on the merits of the case,"" Jiang said. ""It has been managed by the most senior level of leadership at every step."" The defendants haven't seen their relatives since they were arrested in early April, a friend of Gu's family said last week. Bo has not been seen in public since he was stripped of his titles. When the murder charges were announced last month, Xinhua, the state-run news agency, reported that ""the facts of the two defendants' crime are clear, and the evidence is irrefutable and substantial."" If convicted, the two could face the death penalty. The Xinhua report said that Gu and the couple's son, Bo Guagua, had ""conflicts"" with Heywood ""over economic interests."" It alleged that Gu and Zhang had poisoned the Briton because Gu was worried that he was ""threat to her son's personal security."" International media reports have speculated about the nature of Heywood's work in China and his ties to the Bo family. He had lived in China for more than a decade and was married to a Chinese woman. Among the companies he advised was a consulting firm founded by former officers of the British spy agency MI6. Bo Guagua, 24, said in an e-mail Tuesday that he had submitted a witness statement to the defense team for his mother. ""I have faith that facts will speak for themselves,"" wrote Bo, who graduated from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government in May. He previously attended Oxford, graduating in 2010. His illustrious education is an indication of the influence and ambitions of his family, which is now engulfed by scandal. As the son of Bo Yibo, one the ""eight immortals"" of the revolution that created modern China, Bo Xilai was considered a strong contender for promotion into the Standing Committee of the party's Politburo, whose nine members decide how to run China. He stood out as one of China's most dynamic and controversial politicians, notably for his populist policies in Chongqing that promoted Chinese Communist culture and aimed to crack down on organized crime. Gu is also descended from a revolutionary hero: Maj. Gen. Gu Jingsheng, a prominent military figure. Fluent in English, she is a lawyer who took a leading role in a legal battle in the United States involving several Chinese firms. She eventually won the lawsuit for the Chinese companies and later wrote a book about it. As well as being involved in her most notable professional triumph, the United States has also played a role in her undoing. The case she is now facing may never have come to light had it not been for an extraordinary series of actions by Wang Lijun, Bo's longtime lieutenant. Officials had quickly blamed Heywood's death on excessive alcohol consumption, and his body was cremated without an autopsy. But on February 6, Wang, the former police chief who had run the anti-crime push in Chongqing that helped to build Bo's reputation, sought refuge at the U.S. Consulate in nearby Chengdu. He wanted political asylum and apparently feared for his life. Media reports and online posts have claimed that he had clashed with Bo after suggesting that Heywood had been poisoned amid a business dispute with Gu. He gave information about Heywood's death to U.S. officials before he left the consulate and was taken into custody by Chinese security forces. The British government was made aware of Wang's comments and made a formal request to the Chinese authorities to investigate the case on February 15. A month later, Xinhua announced that Bo had been removed as party secretary of Chongqing. And less than a month after that, Gu and Zhang were arrested. The case has forced the Communist leadership to confront allegations of wrongdoing by a high-ranking member in an unusually public way, according to Douglas Paal, a top China analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ""The disruption of his departure from office and his wife's crimes have made it difficult to present a facade of unity to their people,"" Paal said. That united front has been key to ruling China for 2,000 years, he said. The current generation of leaders has been particularly sensitive to maintaining it since 1989, when the party hierarchy split over how to deal with the pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.

Florcruz, Jethro Mullen, Jason Kessler and Matt Smith, and journalist Peter Shadbolt contributed to this report.","The trial gets under way in the eastern city of Hefei, officials say .

"(CNN) -- China's top banker has pulled out of the International Monetary Fund meetings in Tokyo Wednesday in a move widely seen as a protest for the ongoing dispute between Japan and China over islands in the East China Sea. Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China, was scheduled to give the Per Jacobsson lecture at the IMF-World Bank annual meetings being held this year through Sunday in Tokyo. A spokesperson for the IMF said they were told two days ago that Zhou's schedule might require him to cancel his lecture in Tokyo. ""His deputy Yi Gang will represent him at the IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings and will deliver his Per Jacobsson Lecture,"" the spokesperson said. Past speakers for the lecture have included U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and Mohamed A. El-Erian, CEO of PIMCO. Zhou's decision not to attend follows news earlier this week that representatives from China's four major banks -- the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank of China -- would not be attending the IMF meetings in protest of the territorial dispute. Last month the Japanese government bought the disputed islands from the Japanese family that privately owned the islands for 2.05 billion yen (US$26.2 million). That move brought already rising tensions to a boil in China, where often violent protests broke out in dozens of Chinese cities -- from Guangzhou in the south to Qingdao in the north. Japanese cars, stores and factories were damaged in many areas. Japan's largest automakers said Tuesday that sales in China nosedived in September in the face of Japanese product boycotts. Toyota sales in China dropped 48.9% compared to a year ago. Honda sales were down 40.5% from 2011, and Nissan reported a 35.3% decline in sales.

He removed my clothes and sexually assaulted me in front of the other policemen."" For nine months, he says, his family couldn't find him in hospitals and police stations. His mother started to wear black in mourning. Read more: Victims of injustice' in post-revolution Egypt speak out . Finally, his family located him and were able to visit him briefly in prison. Taha was released in July, without ever being indicted. He's now 18. Egypt's Ministry of Interior refused to comment on Taha's claims and has long maintained that there is no torture inside its prisons. Read more: Egypt president's tricky game of power . Taha, who says he has overcome the trauma with the help of a psychiatrist, recounts his story in a rush -- short sentences without pauses. He believes others who have disappeared from the streets of Cairo since the start of last year's revolution may have similar stories -- if they can ever be found. A March 2011 report found that 1,200 people went missing in the course of the uprising in January and February that year, according to Nermeen Yousri, co-founder of the Hanlaqihom (We Will Find Them) Campaign. The list of missing, which activists say is still with the cabinet of ministers, hasn't been updated or cross-checked with lists of names of those found dead or in military prisons. Read more: Amid uneasy calm in Cairo, prime minister says some were paid to protest . Many believe those missing could be in military prisons without proper papers or may have been killed and buried without identification. During the uprising, there were forced, and sometimes temporary, disappearances of activists, and also random rounding up of citizens passing by sites of clashes and protests. Read more: Opinion: Egypt's Islamists have much to prove on women's rights . Simple procedures, like keeping DNA records of anonymous bodies, could have helped narrow down the numbers of the missing, says lawyer Ahmed Raghab, a member of a new fact-finding commission mandated by President Mohamed Morsy. Raghab criticizes the actions of many state institutions, including judicial and investigative authorities, especially when dealing with missing people. The number of the missing, he says, could be in the thousands now following the turbulent 18-month transition. The punishment . Mohamed Siddiq disappeared on January 28, 2011, a ""day of rage"" which resulted in nationwide clashes between police and protesters. His mother was able to talk to him on the phone two weeks later, the same day then-President Hosni Mubarak stepped down. He told her he was in prison. It was the last time she heard from him. ""The ministry of interior tells me all the revolution people are with the army, the army tells me they are with the interior ministry,"" Sabah Siddiq says. She calls her son's mobile number regularly and pays to keep it working. ""I know he's alive,"" she says repeatedly. Read more: Egypt remains on edge during wait for election results . In July 2011, a soldier answered the phone and told her he found the SIM card near a detention facility outside Cairo. When she asked about her son there, officials told her about ""a group of protesters from the revolution"" who were held there. They were moved to an unknown place, she was told. At a gathering for the families of the missing in August, the wails of the mothers screaming the names of their sons challenged claims of change. ""We believe it's a deliberate punishment to people who tried to protest and bring down the regime,"" said Yousri, of the Hanlaqihom Campaign. Read more: As protests calm, tensions remain as U.S. seeks to protect embassies . Taha said he was tortured to force him to confess about crimes he didn't commit. He says he was taken near a protest staged by lawyers against changes in court procedure. He was accused of receiving foreign funding, holding thousands of judges hostage, arms possession, thuggery and protesting against the military. Most of the questions, however, were about his participation in the January 25 protests that forced Mubarak out of office. In pants soaked with blood, Taha says, he eventually signed a pre-written police report. When he pleaded to a deputy prosecutor for help, telling him he was a minor, the official reportedly told him, ""Here, you don't have rights."" ""The value of the human being to our government is still not clear,"" said Yousri. Read more: Egypt's tricky relationship with U.S. The ministry of interior refused to comment on Taha's story and the issue of the missing. The fact-finding commission was formed because of the lack of cooperation by security agencies, Raghab says. ""If these entities were cooperative, a fact-finding mission wouldn't have been needed. Some security agencies have an interest in covering up parts of their crimes."" 'Circle of frustration' Several activists and psychiatrists working on missing persons cases say it is a double punishment for the detainees and the families. In the case of torture, for instance, the victims are denied the ability to adapt to the violence because they usually don't know the reason for their ordeal. The same applies to the family. ""Forced disappearances are worse than murder, because families are deprived from their right to know and to grieve,"" said Hossam Bahgat, director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. Sometimes, he said, families feel that even if their children are dead, they are better off knowing the truth. Read more: New TV channel run by fully veiled women . It's a dilemma. Families ""are afraid to let go of the hope because maybe (their son or daughter is) out there somewhere and they would be letting (them) down if they stopped looking,"" said Yousri. ""It's really a circle of frustration and anger and depression."" Many of the missing were the main providers for their families. To search in prisons scattered across the country is costly, increasing the families' financial burdens. For many, such as Siddiq's family, the search in morgues continues. ""For my son not to come back ... of course, it's taking its toll on all of us. He's my only son. I need him,"" says Siddiq, pausing repeatedly to hold back the tears. Mohamed's picture is placed on the partition separating his small bedroom from the living room. Like Taha, she is frustrated with Egypt's first elected president. She had hoped he would bring about substantial change and find her son. ""Isn't the government supposed to bring me back my son? Who's responsible for this country? Dr. Morsy, right? He's supposed to find where my son is."" Morsy pardoned all political prisoners on Monday, but that leaves the missing file unresolved. Activists suspect that those supposedly held in prison are without proper documentation. Lawyer Ahmed Seif El-Islam, a member of an official committee set up by Morsy to look into prisoners, said in August that there are ""private prisons"" associated with certain security agencies and outside the inspection jurisdiction of the prosecutor. Secret detention facilities in existing prisons, as alleged by some former prisoners, would be even more difficult to pin down, he says. Read more: 5 voices on Egypt's 'unfinished revolution' Taha, however, remains hopeful. ""We must have hope because of the blood of the martyrs, the pain of the injured, the deprivation of the detainees, the injustice dealt to the revolutionaries. These things should inspire hope and push us forward and not look back,"" he says. He was able to get a reversal of a decree expelling him from school for missing a year and is now working on a campaign against torture and the detention of students. ""We can face any oppressor or corrupt regime until we find the Egypt that we want, that we dream of,"" he says. ""We will continue to the last breath.""","One report finds that 1,200 people were missing in the months after Egypt's revolution .

"(CNN) -- The race-conscious admissions policy at the University of Texas appeared to be in trouble on Wednesday after the conservative Supreme Court majority repeatedly questioned its continued application and effectiveness. The Justices heard oral arguments in an affirmative-action case that explores whether the flagship state university's admissions practices aimed at creating campus diversity violate the rights of some white applicants. Abigail Noel Fisher sued the school after her application was rejected in 2008 when she was a high school senior in Sugar Land, Texas. Opinion: Keep affirmative action but reform it . Fisher claimed the individualized, discretionary admission policies violated her rights, and favored African-American and Hispanic applicants over whites and Asian-Americans. Fisher just missed the opportunity of automatic admission to the main campus at Austin for in-state students finishing in the top 10% of their high school graduating class. So, she had to compete in a separate pool. It is that selection process that is before the court. The Supreme Court was clearly divided along ideological lines about whether affirmative action essentially has run its social and legal course, and should no longer be used in the way schools like Texas and others have done. Student voices differ on diversity . ""You're trying to gut it,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor said to Fisher's lawyer about the current legal precedent set in 2003. She suggested that a university deserves some flexibility to create the kind of diverse campus environment it wants. But Chief Justice John Roberts repeatedly asked, ""What is the 'critical mass' of African-Americans and Hispanics at the university that you are working toward?"" When the school's lawyer said there was no specific number, Roberts pressed, ""So how are we supposed to tell whether this plan is narrowly tailored to that goal? What is the logical end point?"" Justice Anthony Kennedy may prove the deciding or ""swing"" vote and could strike a compromise position -- possibly toss out the specific plan in question, while generally preserving the future use of affirmative action in more limited circumstances. The school, with a 52,000-student body, defends its ""holistic"" policy of considering race as one of many factors -- including test scores, community service, leadership and work experience. The Obama administration backed the school. ""Everyone competes against everyone else. Race is not a mechanical automatic factor. It's an holistic individualized consideration,"" said U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli. African-Americans in Texas as a whole represent about 12% of the population, but comprise about 5% of students at the University of Texas. Much of the discussion during arguments surrounded the definition of ""critical mass"" -- how a university can use metrics to determine when it has reached the right mix of minority students to achieve diversity. Justice Stephen Breyer wondered why his colleagues were even debating the issue following 2003 high court ruling that found state universities could narrowly set up admissions policies to consider an applicant's race. The relevant high court case from nine years ago dealt with the University of Michigan's admission programs. The issue was divisive, with Justice Sandra Day O'Connor the swing vote upholding the law school's admissions criteria. O'Connor, who is no longer on the bench, predicted affirmative action would no longer be needed in 25 years, offering a gentle push to institutions to keep that timeline in mind. Nearly a decade later, however, the newly-configured court may be poised to issue a more dramatic statement on the use of race. The Texas school modified its admission policy to include race as one factor shortly after the 2003. The court's more conservative members seized the initiative during arguments. Roberts questioned how schools were to measure classroom diversity among students who come from mixed race families. Justice Samuel Alito suggested it was unfair to place Asian-Americans into one group, when they come from a wide range of cultures-- Filipinos, Chinese, and Afghans among them. ""I thought that the whole purpose of affirmative action was to help students who come from underprivileged backgrounds, but you make a very different argument that I don't think I've ever seen before,"" he told Gregory Garre, representing the school. Garre said the school wants minorities from different backgrounds. ""We go out of our way to recruit minorities from disadvantaged backgrounds,"" he said. Kennedy jumped in. ""So what you're saying is that what counts is race above all,"" he said. ""You want underprivileged of a certain race and privileged of a certain race. So that's race."" Kennedy added later: ""I thought that the whole point is that sometimes race has to be a tie-breaker and you are saying that it isn't. Well, then, we should just go away. Then we should just say you can't use race, don't worry about it."" The young woman who is challenging affirmative action . Fisher graduated this year from Louisiana State University.

"(CNN) -- Li Na's hopes of a second successive grand slam final appearance were washed away between the showers at Roland Garros Thursday -- losing her second round match to American Bethanie Mattek-Sands. Li, the 2011 French Open champion, won the first four games of the match, but could not prevent Mattek-Sands closing out a 5-7 6-3 6-2 victory on Court One. The sixth seed did take the opening set despite a comeback by her stocky opponent, but fell 4-1 down in the second before the first bout of rain. The pair returned one hour 45 minutes later and in a short spell of action, Li retrieved the break of service to trail 4-3. When they returned after another lengthy break of 90 minutes, Mattek-Sands took the next two games to level the match and romped through the decider. Li, beaten by Victoria Azarenka in the final of the Australian Open, refused to use the weather delays as an excuse. ""Lose is lose, I cannot find another thing. The weather didn't change anything -- for both of us it was the same,"" she told gathered reporters. Mattek-Sands will next play Argentina's Paula Ormaechea for a place in the last 16. Ormaechea beat Yaroslav Shvedova of Kazakstan 6-4 7-6. Shvedova beat Li in the fourth round of the 2012 French Open as the Chinese star made her title defense, but was unable to repeat that form. Third seed Azarenka continued her impressive progress in search of a second straight grand slam title with a 6-4 6-3 win over Annika Beck of Germany. Second seed and defending champion Maria Sharapova played her second round match against Eugenie Bouchard of Canada later Thursday and was on the brink of victory, leading 6-2 and 4-2 in the second set when rain intervened again to end proceedings. She will return Friday to complete the task, while the same fate befell the men's defending champion Rafael Nadal, who did not even get on court for his second round encounter with Martin Klizan of Slovakia. Top seed Novak Djokovic came onto court four hours late to play Argentina's Guido Pella and the light drizzle persisted, but the Serbian had enough time to finish the task, winning 6-2 6-0 6-2.

"(CNN) -- Two American scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry Wednesday for their work revealing protein receptors that tell cells what is going on in and around the human body. Their achievements have allowed drug makers to develop medication with fewer side effects. Research spanning four decades by Robert J. Lefkowitz and Brian K. Kobilka on ""G-protein-coupled receptors"" has increased understanding of how cells sense chemicals in the bloodstream and external stimuli like light, according to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awarded the prize. Lefkowitz began the research by tracking adrenalin receptors. The Nobel Prize announcement apparently set off some of the excitement hormone in his own body. ""I'm feeling very, very excited,"" he said in a predawn phone call from the United States to the committee in Stockholm, Sweden, which announced the winners at 5:45 a.m. ET. Nobel Prize in medicine awarded to Sir John Gurdon and Shiny Yamanaka . ""Did I even have any inkling that it was coming?"" Lefkowitz said. ""I'd have to say no."" He contacted Kobilka via a Skype video call to celebrate the news after receiving the call from the Nobel committee. Lefkowitz, with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, began tracking cell receptors with radioactive substances in 1968. In the 1980s, Kobilka, from Stanford University School of Medicine in California, joined the research to isolate the human gene that produces the adrenalin receptor, the academy said. ""Kobilka achieved another break-through"" in 2011, the academy said in a news release: a photographic image of a hormone triggering a receptor to send an impulse into its cell. ""This image is a molecular masterpiece -- the result of decades of research,"" the academy said. Humans experience G-protein-coupled receptors most consciously when they smell, see and taste, the academy explained in a background document. But within the body, they sense ""signaling substances, such as adrenalin, serotonin, histamine and dopamine."" ""They serve as the gateway to the cells,"" Lefkowitz said. ""Around half of all medications act through these receptors, among them beta blockers, antihistamines and various kinds of psychiatric medications,"" the academy explained. In the case of adrenalin -- known in science as epinephrine -- receptors in cells of the heart make it beat faster and receptors in muscle cells signal them to activate to mobilize a person's strength. Newly anointed Nobel Laureate Lefkowitz can use the energy boost. ""I'm thinking that this is going to be a very hectic day,"" he said. ""I was going to get a haircut,"" he revealed, triggering laughter at the academy, as he explained that he really felt he needed one. ""But I'm afraid it will probably have to be postponed."" Nobel Prizes in chemistry have gone to predominantly to organic (or carbon-based) chemistry, particularly to discoveries in the area of life sciences, such as genetics. This year's monetary award will be 8 million Swedish kronor (about $1.2 million). This represents a drop of 20%, compared with last year, from 10 million Swedish kronor, and is due to the turbulence that has hit financial markets. Last year, Israeli scientist Daniel Shechtman from Technion - Israel Institute of Technology won the award for the discovery of quasicrystals, which was made in 1982 and ""fundamentally altered how chemists conceive of solid matter,"" according to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Read more: Frenchman, American win Nobel Prize in physics . On Tuesday, the academy bestowed Nobel honors in physics on Serge Haroche of France and David Wineland of the United States for their work in quantum optics that allowed scientists to observe the workings of atoms without disturbing their properties. As a side effect, their work lays down principles that could lead to quantum computers, which are astronomically fast computers that would radically change human life, if ever invented. On Monday, the Nobel Assembly awarded the prize for physiology or medicine to Sir John B. Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka jointly for their discovery that stem cells can be made of mature cells and need not necessarily be taken from fetuses or embryos. Read more: Nobel Prize in medicine awarded for groundbreaking cell research . The committee also will announce prizes in literature, peace and economics. Since 1901, the committee has handed out the Nobel Prize in chemistry 103 times. In certain years, mainly during World Wars I and II, no prize in chemistry was awarded. The youngest recipient was Frederic Joliot, who won in 1935 at the age of 35. The oldest chemistry laureate was John B. Fenn, who was 85 when he received the prize in 2002. Frederic Sanger was the only scientist to win the chemistry prize twice for his work related to the structure of proteins and DNA. There is a fine line between the science of chemistry and the fields of physics and biology. Famed female scientist Marie Curie of France, for example, won Nobel honors for her work in radiophysics in 1903 and then again in 1911 for discoveries in radiochemistry.","NEW: The prize recognizes work revealing how cells sense chemicals .

"(CNN) -- When the job offer came from the Food and Drug Administration in the winter of 2005, Sarah Sellers jumped at the chance. It was her ""dream job,"" she says, and she picked up her family and moved from Chicago to Washington. Two years later, she left in frustration, unable, she says, to do the job she was hired to do: help clean up compounding pharmacies. Compound pharmacists create customized medication solutions for patients for whom manufactured pharmaceuticals won't work, according to the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists. Those mixed-batch drugs can range from children's cough syrup -- like adding grape flavor -- to complex concoctions that treat cancer, according to Kevin Outterson, an associate professor of health law and bioethics at Boston University. As a young pharmacist, Sellers had worked in a compounding pharmacy and was shocked by what she describes as unsterile conditions. ""The pharmacy was purportedly making sterile injections from scratch using non-sterile ingredients,"" she told a Senate committee in 2003. ""When I asked permission to order and substitute FDA-approved products because of safety concerns, I was cautioned that it would be less profitable for the pharmacy."" At the FDA, Sellers had hoped to help write new federal sterility guidelines for compounding pharmacies. ""I expected the guidelines to come out when I was working at the agency in 2006,"" Sellers said. ""But it never happened. It was so frustrating."" More than six years later, those guidelines -- which some experts say might have prevented the current outbreak of meningitis -- still have not come out. Twelve people have died in the current outbreak of non-contagious fungal meningitis, linked to contaminated steroid injections made by the Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center. Meningitis outbreak highlights failed oversight efforts . ""We've been waiting for years for these guidelines,"" said Michael Cohen, a pharmacist and president of the Institute for Safe Medication Practices. ""They're desperately needed to assure patient safety."" Over the years, people have died, been blinded and become ill from contaminated medicines made at compounding pharmacies. In 2003, the Government Accountability Office testified that the FDA was aware of more than 200 adverse events associated with drugs from compounding pharmacies since 1990. The infections continued: For example, in 2011, nine people in Alabama died from blood infections after they received intravenous medicine made at a compounding pharmacy, and in 2011 and 2012, 33 people suffered fungal eye infections from drops made at a compounding pharmacy in Florida. The sterility guidelines are in ""in progress,"" according to Erica Jefferson, an FDA spokeswoman. The agency, she said, has tried for 20 years to have more oversight of compounding pharmacies but has faced challenges by the industry. When asked why it's taking years to write these guidelines, Jefferson declined to comment. Sellers said that when she worked at the FDA, ""political pressure"" kept the guidelines from being published. ""Compounding pharmacies make a lot of money, and it goes to various places at the state and federal level,"" she said. The International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists has spent more than $1 million over the past decade on lobbying, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. David Miller, the group's executive vice president and chief executive officer, denies that his group has lobbied against federal sterility standards and says it has actually been fighting for them. ""We've written to the FDA; we've written to Congress,"" Miller said. ""We've been pushing on this since before 2003."" After Sellers left the FDA, she moved back to Chicago and became an independent consultant, and she still fights for better standards for compounding pharmacies. The problem, she says, is bigger than just a few outbreaks, since illnesses might not be traced back to contaminated drugs. ""The FDA only knows about the safety concerns they hear about,"" she said. CNN's Danielle Dellorto contributed to this report.","At the FDA, Sarah Sellers fought for compounding pharmacy guidelines .

"(CNN) -- Sylvia Mathews Burwell will be nominated Monday by President Barack Obama to be the director of the Office of Management and Budget, a senior Obama administration official said. Burwell, 47, is currently the head of the Walmart Foundation, the retail chain's charitable organization. The organization donated nearly $1 billion to causes worldwide in 2011, according to its website. If confirmed by the Senate, she will assume a Cabinet-rank position as head of the White House agency that assists the president on budget matters. While it may not have the profile of jobs such as secretary of state or secretary of defense, the OMB position is a central part of a president's administration. One example of its importance is the rise of Jack Lew, who held that job before becoming White House chief of staff and now treasury secretary. The stakes are especially high now, with Obama engaged in a protracted, heated battle with the Republican-led House of Representatives about the size and shape of the federal government's budget. The two sides have failed to reach an agreement to avert mandatory, across-the-board spending cuts -- to the tune of $85 billion through the next seven months of the current fiscal year -- that took effect Friday. In addition, a possible government shutdown looms at the end of this month. Boehner 'hopeful' on preventing government shutdown . Walmart CEO Mike Duke congratulated Burwell on her upcoming nomination, calling her ""a strong leader who both masters the details and has a clear vision for making big things happen."" ""She cares deeply about people (and) she understands business and the role that business, government and civil society must play to build a strong economy that provides opportunities and strengthens communities across the country,"" Duke said in a statement. Beyond her more recent work in corporate philanthropy -- including as the chief operating officer and founding president of the Global Development Program at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through 2011 -- Burwell has experience in government. She worked in President Bill Clinton's administration under then-Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, something that she has in common with Lew and Peter Orszag, another OMB chief in the Obama administration. For parts of 1997 and 1998, Burwell was a deputy chief of staff to Clinton, according to her profile on MetLife's website, where she is a member of its board of directors. She served as deputy director of the OMB between 1998 and 2001.","Sylvia Mathews Burwell will be nominated to lead the Office of Management and Budget .

"(CNN) -- Cyclist Lance Armstrong was part of ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen,"" the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said Wednesday in releasing more than 1,000 pages of evidence in the case. The evidence involving the U.S. Postal Service-sponsored cycling team encompasses ""direct documentary evidence including financial payments, e-mails, scientific data and laboratory test results that further prove the use, possession and distribution of performance-enhancing drugs by Lance Armstrong,"" the agency said. Armstrong lawyer Tim Herman dismissed what he called a ""one-sided hatchet job"" and a ""government-funded witch hunt"" against the seven-time Tour de France winner, who has consistently denied doping accusations. Armstrong teammates recount dodging, tricking drug testers . But the USADA said 11 riders came forward to acknowledge their use of banned performance-enhancing drugs while on the team. Among them is George Hincapie, Armstrong's close teammate during his winning Tour de France runs. ""I'm not suggesting that they are all lying, but I am suggesting that each witness needs to have confrontation and cross examination to test the accuracy of their recollection,"" Herman said. The USADA is sending its ""reasoned decision"" to the international governing body of cycling, the Union Cycliste Internationale, as well as the World Anti-Doping Agency and the World Triathlon Corporation, which runs Ironman competitions. Highlights of the Armstrong report . In the past, Armstrong argued that he has taken more than 500 drug tests and never failed. In its 202-page report, the USADA said it had tested Armstrong less than 60 times and the UCI conducted about 215 tests. ""Thus the number of actual controls on Mr. Armstrong over the years appears to have been considerably fewer than the number claimed by Armstrong and his lawyers,"" the USADA said. The agency didn't say that Armstrong ever failed one of those tests, only that his former teammates testified as to how they beat tests or avoided the test administrators altogether. Several riders also said team officials seemed to know when random drug tests were coming, the report said. The agency also said it had a professor compare Armstrong's red cell and plasma levels from blood samples taken late in his career, and they showed levels that wouldn't be expected of an athlete competing in a three-week endurance event like the Tour de France. What's behind the Armstrong headlines . Hincapie publicly admitted for the first time Wednesday that he took drugs. ""Early in my professional career, it became clear to me that, given the widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs by cyclists at the top of the profession, it was not possible to compete at the highest level without them,"" Hincapie said in a written statement. ""I deeply regret that choice and sincerely apologize to my family, teammates and fans."" Hincapie testified, the report said, that he was aware of Armstrong's use of the drug EPO, or erythropoietin, which boosts the number of red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the muscles, and his use of blood transfusions. He also testified Armstrong dropped out of a race in 2000 to avoid a positive drug test, according to the report, which was accompanied by hundred of pages of supporting documents like Hincapie's 16-page affidavit. Three members of the Postal Service team, which changed sponsors in 2005,  will contest the accusations, the agency said. They are team director Johan Bruyneel, team doctor Pedro Celaya and team trainer Jose ""Pepe"" Marti. Each will get a hearing before an independent judge, according to the agency. The agency compiled the evidence as part of its investigation into doping allegations that have dogged Armstrong and the Postal Service team for years. The organization is not a governmental agency but is designated by Congress as the country's official anti-doping organization for Olympic sports. In August, four days after a federal judge dismissed Armstrong's lawsuit seeking to block the agency's investigation, Armstrong announced he would no longer fight the accusations. The agency then announced it would ban Armstrong from the sport for life and strip him of his results dating from 1998. ""When Mr. Armstrong refused to confront the evidence against him in a hearing before neutral arbitrators, he confirmed the judgment that the era in professional cycling which he dominated as the patron of the peloton was the dirtiest ever,"" the USADA writes in its decision. ""Peloton"" refers to the main group of riders in a bike race. Armstrong: It's time to move forward . The agency praised the 11 riders who came forward to document the widespread use of banned substances by the team. But in a statement issued Wednesday afternoon, attorney Herman called the expected USADA report ""a taxpayer-funded tabloid piece rehashing old, disproved, unreliable allegations, based largely on axe-grinders, serial perjurers, coerced testimony, sweetheart deals and threat-induced stories."" In addition to Hincapie, the agency identified the cyclists who came forward as Frankie Andreu, Michael Barry, Tom Danielson, Tyler Hamilton, Floyd Landis, Levi Leipheimer, Stephen Swart, Christian Vande Velde, Jonathan Vaughters and David Zabriskie. The agency said those riders would receive various punishments, including suspensions and disqualifications. The scope of evidence against the team is ""overwhelming,"" according to the agency. ""The USPS Team doping conspiracy was professionally designed to groom and pressure athletes to use dangerous drugs, to evade detection, to ensure its secrecy and ultimately gain an unfair competitive advantage through superior doping practices,"" the agency said. Your Armstrong questions answered . Armstrong became a household name not only in Europe, where cycling is wildly popular, but also in the United States, where the sport traditionally attracted little attention before he embarked on a remarkable stretch between 1999 and 2005 and won seven consecutive Tour de France titles. Persistent accusations that he used performance-enhancing drugs grew as he won more Tours. Author and cycling journalist Bill Strickland compared the case to baseball's ""Black Sox"" scandal, when eight Chicago White Sox players conspired with gamblers to throw the 1919 World Series. But he said Armstrong is ""not interested in ever admitting to his guilt, and he just wants to move on right now."" ""Despite this evidence and despite all the evidence that has come out, he's got a strong core of people who believe in him and will always believe in him because of his link to fighting cancer,"" said Strickland, who chronicled Armstrong's 2009 return to the Tour de France in a 2011 book. Opinion: Armstrong and the tenuous nature of heroism . But how Armstrong might move on is unclear. ""Certainly, he's not going to be able to move on within the sport,"" Strickland told CNN. ""It seems likely that all of his Tour victories will be stripped. He won't be allowed to participate in any sports that are signatories of WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency. But he's found a few triathlons to do in the meantime."" And he said the allegations could lead to the reopening of a criminal case against Armstrong that federal prosecutors closed without charges in February. ""What's next is years and years of fighting if the criminal case is reopened,"" Strickland said. The USADA opened its own case, which does not carry criminal penalties, in June.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Wednesday unanimously repealed a resolution made seven decades ago supporting the internment of Japanese Americans shortly after Japan's Pearl Harbor attacks, which led the United States to enter World War II. The five-member board heard emotional testimony from Japanese-Americans who were incarcerated in the internment camps or whose parents were placed in the camps. They recounted the racial hysteria of the era. Donald Nose, president of the Go For Broke National Education Center, a nonprofit group dedicated to Japanese-American civil liberties issues during WWII, said, ""To this day, my uncle and mother still have nightmares about the incarceration process."" Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas introduced the motion Wednesday to void the board's 1942 endorsement of the barbed-wired camps. ""The internment of American citizens of Japanese ancestry was no doubt a low point in American history. The county of Los Angeles in ... 1942 contributed to that by a resolution that is on the books of this great institution,"" Ridley-Thomas said during the meeting. ""To ignore this and leave it as unfinished business is essentially to trivialize it, and we choose not to trivialize this travesty,"" Ridley-Thomas said. More than 70 years ago, the board voted unanimously to endorse President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066 in February 1942 that put 120,000 Japanese Americans, about a third from Los Angeles County, in internment camps for up to three years, Ridley-Thomas said. The board said then it was difficult ""if not impossible to distinguish between loyal and disloyal Japanese aliens."" Ridley-Thomas said his proposal was meant ""to address a historic wrong."" 'Ways of escaping the barbed wire fences': George Takei's internment camp experience . Bill Watanabe, the recently retired executive director of the Little Tokyo Service Center in Los Angeles, a social welfare agency, said he read the 1942 resolution on Tuesday and found it disturbing. ""It would be comical if it weren't so tragic,"" Watanabe told the board. ""Since you can't tell (between loyal and disloyal Japanese aliens), let's round them all up and put them away. ""This kind of thinking cannot exist in the county of Los Angeles, which takes pride in its diversity,"" Watanabe said. Los Angeles County Chief Executive Officer William Fujioka, a third-generation Japanese-American, told the board that his grandfather, a prominent businessman in Los Angeles' Little Toyko neighborhood, was among the first detainees rounded up and was sent to Fort Leavenworth because the U.S. government ""thought he was a spy."" Fujioka's father was also put in a camp while in his fourth year at the University of California, Berkeley, and he had never finished college at the time of his death in 1992, Fujioka said. Despite the indignities, his family ""taught me to be a proud American,"" Fujioka told the board. He then began crying. Actor George Takei, who played Mr. Sulu on the television series ""Star Trek,"" also testified in support of the motion and recalled his experience when two U.S. soldiers with bayonet rifles took him, then age 5, and his parents and family from their Los Angeles home and placed them in reeking horse stalls at the Santa Anita racetrack. ""My mother remembers it as the most degrading, humiliating experience she ever had in her life. She didn't know the other humiliations that were going to follow,"" Takei told the board. ""But for me, I remember it as it was kind of fun to sleep where the horsies sleep."" Takei and his family were then sent to internment camps in Rohwer, Arkansas, and Tule Lake, California. Marlene Shigekawa, 67, of Lafayette, California, didn't attend Wednesday's board meeting, but in an interview with CNN, she said she was born in barbed-wire-enclosed internment camp in Poston, Arizona, in 1944. Her mother, now 103, lives in Culver City near Los Angeles, she said. ""For the Japanese-Americans of all generations, the interment experience was a defining moment,"" Shigekawa said. ""It spoke to the courage and ability to endure and to overcome a painful experience in which Japanese-Americans at the time of the war were dishonored and shunned by their own country. ""It brings back a bittersweet experience in the sense that there was so much pain in terms of shame and humiliation associated with it, but the community was triumphant in overcoming adverse circumstances and building a future for subsequent generations,"" she said. Shigekawa, a board member of the Poston Community Alliance, a nonprofit restoring the Poston internment camp, said she and the group are making a documentary on Japanese-American mothers and their children born in Poston, located on the Colorado River Indian Reservation. At the end of this month, the group is planning to return to the Poston internment camp site an original wooden barracks that's now located 15 miles away in Parker, Arizona, where a local man had bought the barracks, she said. The alliance is now in the process of having the Poston camp declared a National Historic Landmark because it was the largest of the camps, with 18,000 Japanese-Americans at its peak, making it the third largest city in Arizona then, she said.","NEW: ""We choose not to trivialize this travesty,"" L.A.

"(CNN) -- Authorities scoured the national park around Washington's Mount Rainier on Sunday for a man they say fatally shot a park ranger and fled into the woods, a park spokeswoman said. The suspect remained at large Sunday night, believed to be somewhere in the expansive park, Mount Rainier National Park spokeswoman Lee Taylor said. Four to five feet of snow is on the ground, including about two feet of fresh powder, where the gunman escaped. ""There's a lot of snow on the ground, (and) it would be difficult to move through quickly,"" Taylor told CNN. ""And it's heavily forested."" The bloodshed began with what the spokesman called ""a normal traffic stop"" around 10:30 a.m. PT (1:30 p.m. ET). But the suspect didn't heed a request to pull over, prompting a ranger to radio ahead requesting assistance. Park ranger Margaret Anderson, 34, responded to that call and set up her patrol vehicle as a roadblock. ""When he (the shooter) arrived at that spot, he got out (of his car) and fatally shot her,"" said Taylor. The suspect then ran into the spacious national park, whose border is about 50 miles southeast of Seattle. The park -- the centerpiece being the 14,410-foot Mount Rainier, which is considered an active volcano -- comprises 235,625 acres in the Cascade Range. Entrances to the park were closed after the shooting. Taylor said that authorities were able to ""evacuate most of the people ... safely,"" with more than 100 people ""holed up in our primary visitor center"" with food, water and five law enforcement officers standing guard. ""We don't want to try to have those people get to their vehicle and caravan down the park road where it could be dangerous, being sniped at by a gunman,"" the spokeswoman said Sunday night. ""So for now, they are going to sit tight in the visitor center."" Anderson was the mother of a 4-year-old and 1-year-old and the wife of a fellow park ranger, according to Taylor. A ranger at Mount Rainier for the past four years, Anderson ""was on the job not for money or for glory, but out of a love for wild places and the national parks,"" said Taylor. She is survived by her husband, who is also a park ranger, as well as a 4-year-old and a 1-year-old. ""She was a person with a quick smile, a very gentle person, a very competent ranger,"" said Taylor. ""This gunman took the life of somebody who had a great deal to live for and was making great contributions to society by being a national park ranger."" CNN's Adam Shivers contributed to this report.","NEW: More than 100 people will stay in a visitor center until the situation is safe, a spokeswoman says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden is a gaffe-prone avuncular type; Rep. Paul Ryan's is a wonky Gen-Xer. But both men will face the same challenge at their debate on Thursday: staying out of their own way. ""Biden, the thing he does so well for someone his age is he has a lot of energy,"" said Melissa Wade, a debate professor at Emory University. ""A lot of the way he messes up is he's so energetic, he gets wound up and he finds an inappropriate metaphor and runs with it."" Ryan, she said, needs to have the same energy as Biden, ""or it's not going to fly."" Moreover, Wade said that the conservative House Budget Committee Chairman has to let people know he's more than an economic expert ""and a wonk"" and that he can ""relate to real people."" The two face off in the only vice presidential debate at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. In light of the results of the first debate, how important is the vice presidential debate? The visual difference alone makes for interesting television. ""The contrast between Biden and Ryan will be stark in terms of age and vitality,"" said Christopher Arterton, a professor of political management at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management. Read John King's take: Is debate a game-changer? Biden is a silver-haired sexagenarian with tons of energy. Ryan is a younger guy who works out to P90X but can be a bit flat energy-wise. ""Biden is comfortable in his body, and when he's uncomfortable it shows all the more,"" Wade said. ""Ryan -- the nerves can show in so many ways. He's been a little stiff on the stump, particularly when Romney is talking."" Biden is in the role of making up for the surprising poor performance of his boss, President Barack Obama, in his first debate last week. For Ryan, it's an opportunity to build on the clear debate bounce for his boss, MItt Romney. The stress of that pressure could produce some hiccups. Biden is well known for off-the-cuff remarks, while Ryan can be rigid when pressed, political experts say. ""This debate is more interesting because ... in the world of political theater, it's taken on more importance,"" Wade said. ""When you have a staggering Act I, Act II becomes more important."" According to political experts, Obama allowed a more aggressive Romney to go largely unchallenged on key issues. Biden's task, political experts say, is to address those points and set Obama up for a stronger showing in the second of three presidential debates on Tuesday. VP debates can kill political careers . It is a task magnified by tightening polls, though the vice presidency often demands sharp political elbows, and Biden is an experienced debater. Polls show size of Romney's post-debate bounce . The question is ""can Ryan keep the momentum going in Romney's favor or can Biden blunt the damage,"" said Mark Jones, chairman of Rice University's political science department. Since Obama didn't aggressively push Romney to give details about the Romney-Ryan plan to whittle the nation's debt and prove that doing so won't shift the burden to the middle class, Biden will likely push Ryan to do so, Jones said. But Biden must play the aggressor without coming off as a bully or slipping up with an unexpected comment. ""The Democrats are in a difficult situation in that they do need him to go after Ryan on the Ryan plan and the differences on taxes on the rich versus the middle class,"" Jones said. ""Biden will be attacking Ryan some, but he has to be somewhat careful in that they don't want him going over the top and committing gaffes."" For Ryan, an experienced lawmaker but first-time national candidate and novice debater, the stakes are especially high, political experts say. CNN Exclusive: Ryan's debate prep as meticulous as he is . ""It's hard to imagine what it's like when there are so many lights in your face (and so much pressure),"" Wade said. ""It's Ryan's opportunity to present himself to people in a party that is struggling to define itself. ... Ronald Reagan is long gone, and they're still running on that mantle. Ryan is saying, where do we go from there."" Ryan must also defend Romney's positions while taking great pains not to overshadow the nominee. He'll have to tread carefully in defending the Romney plan â€” especially if Biden pushes him on his own debt plan. Ryan is well aware of the challenge. ""He raised the bar quite high, that's for sure. Mitt definitely put the pressure on from that perspective,"" Ryan said on Detroit radio station WJR. ""Because they had such a bad debate, Joe Biden is just going to come flying at us,"" Ryan said. ""It seems pretty clear that their new strategy is just basically to call us liars, to descend down into a mud pit and hopefully with enough mudslinging back and forth -- and distortion -- people get demoralized, and they can win by default."" Though vice presidential debates are traditionally considered a lull between the presidential debates, this year voters can expect some fireworks, political experts say. Biden and Ryan ""can be aggressors in a way where presidential candidates are supposed to be above that fray,"" Wade said. Five things to watch for in vice presidential debate .

"Washington (CNN) -- Feeding the hungry is the mission at Manna Food Center, a food bank in the suburbs of the nation's capital. This year, officials here are seeing more and more people who need their help. America's slow recovery from the worst economic crisis in decades has left families across the country struggling to put food on their tables, whether or not they have a job. With an unemployment rate stuck above 9 percent and millions of people working part-time jobs because they cannot find full-time positions, a record 45.8 million people -- one of every seven -- received food stamps from the government in May. Demand for this kind of federal help has risen in all 50 states. Manna helps people who get food stamps and thousands of others who do not qualify for them. The center says the number of people it serves has risen dramatically in recent years -- from 82,683 in fiscal year 2008 to 172,627 people in 2011. On a recent Friday morning, trucks arrived at the warehouse to drop off food the organization rescues from 40 area grocery stores, items that are reaching their sell-by dates but are still safe to eat. Volunteers worked to retrieve the deliveries from the loading docks, while others went from shelf to shelf filling boxes with goods or helping wheel them out to clients' cars. In the office, people began lining up around noon to receive the 70 pounds of fresh produce, canned goods and other items Manna hands out to each family every 30 days. Old and young. White, black and Hispanic. Some came alone; others brought their children or other family members. The economy is adding jobs, but not quickly enough to trickle down to the families the food bank serves. ""Any growth that the economy is feeling, the folks here at Manna are not feeling that yet,"" said Natalie Corbin, Manna's development director, during an interview in the center's main warehouse in Gaithersburg, Maryland. ""In fact, our numbers, from year to year have continued to trend upwards. So until we see a dramatic change in the economy, we're going to continue to see a dramatic increase in folks who are coming here. ""We're expecting this winter to be the highest in history of Manna for folks needing food assistance."" Even people who have jobs are having a hard time feeding their families. Eric Zevallos' mother had surgery a few months ago and is still recovering. Standing in line, he said his family was referred to Manna ""because it's just me and my sister working, and right now it's kind of hard for both of us to provide for younger brothers that we have."" ""It's just a good program to help us out, get stable."" The 25-year-old and his 18-year-old sister are working to feed themselves, their mother and their brothers, who are 9 and 16. ""We've been rationing food and just scraping by,"" Zevallos said. It's not just local food banks that have seen an increase in demand. Feeding America, a national hunger-relief charity that helped feed 37 million people last year, says demand for food relief has risen 40 percent in the past four years. The organization has a network of 202 food banks that work with 61,000 agencies, including soup kitchens, churches and pantries, according to Eric Olsen, senior vice president of government relations. ""Our food banks across the country will tell you stories of people who have been donors who now need food assistance, who have lost their jobs or suffered some other kind of health care trauma, for example, in the family where they just don't have enough to make ends meet,"" Olsen said. ""People look at us as an emergency program, but more and more of our clients are coming to us on an ongoing basis. We are a regular part of how people get enough food to feed their families."" Feeding America gets about 25 percent of its food from the federal government. Manna Food Center also gets government-subsidized food and relies on food drives, donations and state and federal emergency food grant programs. These organizations worry that the 12-member congressional committee established as part of the deal to raise the debt limit and tasked with recommending an additional $1.5 trillion in federal deficit-reduction measures over the next decade could target programs that provide government-subsidized food to these organizations or others that help the needy. That could increase demand at these food banks and strain their resources. ""We really need both government and charity to make sure people in this country have enough to eat,"" Olsen said.","A record 45.8 million people received food stamps from the government in May .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Thursday breached the third and final portion of a levee on the Mississippi River to help offset catastrophic floods in communities across several states. The Corps opened the final crevasse in the Birds Point-New Madrid levee, under a plan that blasted holes in the structure with hopes of easing unprecedented flood pressure, said Col. Vernie L. Reichling Jr., commander of the Memphis district. ""It acted as designed,"" Maj. Gen. Michael J. Walsh, president of the Mississippi River Commission, told reporters about the breaching. ""We reduced the gauges at Paducah (Kentucky) 3.1 feet. At Cairo (Illinois), it's 3.3 feet."" The Corps started the plan on Monday. Some who live where the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers meet said it has helped. The Ohio River level at Cairo, Illinois, has dropped nearly 2 feet since Monday afternoon. Officials said they believe the levels would be up to 3 feet higher now if the levee had not been detonated. Still, the town of Cairo was under a mandatory evacuation order and six other communities were under voluntary evacuation notices, said Patti Thompson, spokeswoman for the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. The decision to breach the Birds Point-New Madrid levee was controversial. Missouri officials took the Corps to court over the plan, questioning the agency's authority to intentionally breach the levee. The state argued the floodwater would deposit silt on about 130,000 acres, and it would take years, along with millions of dollars, to fix the damage. Maj. Gen. Michael Walsh, commander of the Corps' Mississippi River Valley Division, made the decision to order the breach. He warned that without punching a hole in the levee, massive flooding would threaten to inundate communities throughout the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene in the case on Sunday, clearing the way for Walsh to blow up part of the levee. Despite the plan, many areas were inundated as the Mississippi River spilled out across huge swaths of farmland, creating massive flooding from Minnesota to Louisiana. The water was coursing across an area of farmland that Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon described as ""literally the most productive part of our continent."" Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill said the Corps' decision was a tough one for them to make. ""Clearly, this is an epic flood,"" she told CNN, adding that the flooding of the farmland is ""an economic devastation to that part of my state."" The sight makes you ""sick to your stomach,"" said farmer Bryan Feezor as he surveyed his submerged fields. ""Farming is all I ever have done ... and it's under water,"" he told CNN affiliate KPLR. The flooding has been triggered by heavy rains and meteorologists say it's not expected to fully relent until early June. More than 20 miles of westbound Interstate 40 in eastern Arkansas was closed due to flooding, state police reported early Thursday. The closure was between the towns of Hazen and Brinkley, according to Lt. Jackie Clark, who said he expects the eastbound lanes to close later in the day. On Thursday, 11 Mississippi counties along the Mississippi River were declared federal disaster areas in anticipation of major flooding, Gov. Haley Barbour said. ""This will be a monumental flood, and I ask residents to take this risk seriously and make evacuation plans,"" Barbour said. The state's department of transportation prepared a list of possible road closures, but as of Thursday afternoon, only one road was closed, Mississippi State Route 465 in Warren and Issaquena counties between U.S. Highway 61 and Eagle Lake, the agency said. ""There is no exact science to this, so it's imperative that state and federal agencies work closely to lead us through this crisis,"" Central District Transportation Commissioner Dick Hall said in a prepared statement. In Tunica County, Mississippi, officials are expecting the the river to crest at 48 feet on Tuesday -- which will be a record since the levee was built along the county's riverbanks in the mid-1930s, county spokesman Larry Liddell told CNN. Then the river will flow above the 40 feet mark for 40 days, Liddell said. Those heights are still well below the 60 feet needed to push the water over the levee, Liddell said. But the heights are sufficient enough to force the temporary closure, as a precautionary measure, of the county's nine casinos near the levee, Liddell said. Residential areas by the levee have been evacuated, and about 10,000 sand bags have been deployed, he said. About 40 people are being sheltered in a recreation center, and 34 dogs and 16 cats are now in the Paul Battle Arena, sometimes used for horse or livestock shows, he said. The casinos' closure for 40 days would amount to a major economic hit to Tunica County, Liddell said. The gambling centers are the closest casinos available, at 16 miles away, for gamblers from Memphis, Tennessee, a state that doesn't have such facilities, Liddell said. ""It's not a happy mood, but we're happy that we got the levee,"" Liddell told CNN. ""It's a rural county with agriculture No. 1 and casinos No. 2, and now we don't have casinos. We don't know how long it is going to last. We hope it doesn't last too long."" Before the flood, ""we were actually 21% down from last year with the casinos up and running. Now that they're shut down, we're 100% down from last year,"" Liddell said. ""We're just holding on.""

"(CNN) -- Sunday's outbreak of severe weather spawned more than 60 tornadoes and caused damage in several Midwestern states, including Illinois, Indiana and Missouri. There were several fatalities and as many as 200 people were injured statewide. Some of the hardest-hit communities are Washington and Peoria, Illinois, and Kokomo, Indiana. The destruction was widespread, leaving many with little the week before Thanksgiving. The people in these communities will need our help for some time to come. Several organizations are already on the ground, and you can help with their efforts: . Red Cross . As is often the case, the Red Cross is one of the first groups to arrive and provide aid to victims of such terrible storms. The Central Illinois chapter of the Red Cross has established a shelter in the Illinois town of Washington. It also has activated the Safe and Well website to help in finding loved ones who may still be missing. Salvation Army . Before the storm was even at full strength, the Salvation Army had mobilized teams to areas that looked like they would need emergency food and shelter. These teams are dispersed across the region to offer nourishment, shelter and guidance to the needy. The Salvation Army has established a way to give immediately; you can contribute by texting STORM to 80888 to make a $10 donation. Team Rubicon . Team Rubicon is a group of veterans who come together after disasters to provide immediate relief and aid to rescue and recovery workers. It has already sent people to help clear debris in Washington, where many of the injuries occurred. Operation Blessing . The humanitarian organization vows to help even if it doesn't deploy a full disaster response team. Jody Herrington-Gettys, director of domestic disaster relief for Operation Blessing, has pledged support to the region, saying it will partner with local churches and other groups and assist in aid efforts through grants and donations.","More than 60 tornadoes ravaged parts of the Midwest, including Illinois and Indiana .

"(CNN) -- Entertainer Jennifer Lopez says her former driver resorted to blackmail after the singer didn't use a security team he recommended for a music video shoot. In a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles last week, Lopez, her manager and her production company allege that an attorney representing driver Hakob Manoukian demanded that ""unless Manoukian was paid $2.8 million, he would disclose sensitive and personal information that he allegedly heard while driving Lopez."" The lawsuit also accuses the former driver of making ""other ominous threats to report Ms. Lopez to the 'authorities' if his demands were not met."" Lopez is seeking a minimum of $20 million in damages. Her suit is the latest chapter in a legal battle that began in April, when Manoukian, who was also Lopez's head of personal security in Los Angeles, filed a lawsuit accusing Lopez, her manager and her production company of breaching his employment contract when they decided he would not handle production security. J. Lo threatens legal action over reports about boyfriend . Manoukian's lawsuit alleges he had hired two police officers to assist with security during a music video produced by Def Jam Records. The night before the officers were to report for work, Manoukian says he was told to cancel their services and that Lopez' manager was assuming responsibility for hiring personal security. Lopez' suit alleges that Manoukian ""became hostile and angry because he mistakenly and unreasonably believed he had the unqualified right to designate the security team and profit from any budgetary allocations for such security."" Representatives for Lopez and Manoukian could not be immediately reached for comment. Lopez' attorney, Alex Weingarten, declined to comment, saying the ""cross-complaint speaks for itself."" The dispute between Lopez and her former driver dates back to 2011, shortly after Lopez and singer Marc Anthony announced their plans to split. Manoukian quit his job with Anthony's company, ARI Enterprises Ltd., and offered to work for Lopez in July 2011, according to Lopez's suit, which alleges he quit his job ""under false pretenses"" after one month of service.

"(CNN) -- Ivory Coast's president declared three days of national mourning and promised a speedy investigation into the New Year's Day stampede that killed 60 people, most of them women and children. ""The president of the republic offers his saddest condolences to the families and close relations of the victims and ensures them of his compassion in those painful circumstances,"" President Alassane Ouattara's office said in a statement issued Tuesday night. Ouattara went to the scene of the disaster and has ordered the government to take care of the injured, his office said. ""He also asked an investigation to be carried out as soon as possible to determine the circumstances and causes of this stampede,"" the statement said. The horror unfolded about 1 a.m. after a New Year's Eve fireworks show in Abidjan, the West African country's largest city and former capital. The dead included 26 children, 28 women and six men, Youth Minister Alain Lobognon reported via Twitter. Read more: Death toll from stampede at Angola stadium vigil rises . Interior Minister Hamed Bakayoko said the tragedy happened as hundreds of people were trying to go home after the fireworks display ended in Plateau, the city's central business district. The crush was near a stadium, Bakayoko said, adding that the proper security measures were in place during the fireworks show. In addition to the deaths, Bakayoko said, another 49 people were injured, two seriously. Many of the victims were trampled on or suffocated by the surging crowd, a senior fire official said on national television. Rescue workers were at the scene two hours later but could not save the victims, the official AIP news agency said. AIP had reported earlier that all the victims were all children, ranging in age from eight to 15. A police official in Abidjan told CNN that most of the victims were young people who wanted to join in the celebration while their elders stayed at home. The stampede occurred in an area of narrow streets, according to the official, who did not want to be named as he is not authorized to talk to the media. He said the parents of those involved were at the hospitals and were being assisted by state authorities. Before the night's events took a deadly turn, AIP reported that thousands of people had poured into the streets to join the celebration, seen by some as symbolizing the nation's return to peace. Nearly 5,000 extra personnel were deployed to ensure people's security, the news agency said, most of them in the Plateau area. Ivory Coast suffered months of violence following disputed presidential elections in November 2010. Laurent Gbagbo, then the incumbent president, refused to step down after Ouattara was declared the winner. Gbagbo was arrested five months later and is now awaiting trial at The Hague, in the Netherlands, accused of crimes against humanity for the civil unrest and deaths. The International Criminal Court also wants Ivory Coast to hand over his wife, Simone Gbagbo, to face allegations of crimes against humanity. The West African nation is home to around 22 million people, according to the CIA World Factbook. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Stephanie Halasz reported from London; and journalist Gemma Parellada from Abidjan.","NEW: Ouattara vows speedy probe into stampede that kills 60 .

"(EW.com) -- Universal Pictures just turned Valentine's Day 2015 into a sure thing for millions of men. The studio is moving its release date for the movie adaptation of the erotic romance Fifty Shades of Grey out of next summer and onto Valentine's Day weekend 2015, turning what was sure to be a Girls Night Out event into an epic Date Night. The news, reported exclusively in this week's EW cover story, comes on the heels of the studio's announcement that it has pushed the start of production in Vancouver back a month to allow for the production to prep with its new leading man, Northern Irish actor Jamie Dornan, who plays kinky billionaire Christian Grey. But, Universal says, the casting change is not the primary reason for the new release date. EW: E L James launches 'Fifty Shades of Grey' wine . More pressing is the crowded summer schedule Fifty Shades was originally competing in. Originally set to hit screens August 1, 2014, the film, based on the sexy best-seller by E L James, was set to go up opposite Marvel's potential new franchise Guardians of the Galaxy starring Chris Pratt and Benicio del Toro. Internationally things are even busier, with many studios pushing their big tentpoles out of next June and July — to avoid competition from the World Cup in Brazil — and into August. ""We see this movie as a global event,"" Universal Pictures chairman Donna Langley tells EW. ""The strength of this book is really worldwide, so we want to be able to take advantage of women who are invariably on vacation with their families during the month of August in Europe."" Now the film will debut on Valentine's Day weekend, beginning on Friday, February 13, which also coincides with the President's Day holiday, giving Universal the opportunity to post a big three-day number for that frame. Langley, who was instrumental in bringing the Fifty Shades franchise to the studio, adds that Universal would likely have made the change even if Charlie Hunnam, the original actor cast as Christian Grey, had not dropped out in mid-October. ""Together with the international marketing and distribution team, we've been looking really closely at the August date and becoming more and more convinced that the right thing to do for the movie was to push it,"" Langley says. ""So even if Charlie had stayed, we still would have been making the date change."" EW: See the full 'Fifty Shades' coverage . The film's new date will put it up against the adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' The Longest Ride, which has yet to begin production or hire a cast. Who knows, maybe the fear of competing with Fifty Shades will keep it away.

"(CNN) -- Three dozen earthquakes over the past week in central Arkansas shook shelves, rattled nerves and prompted speculation about their cause. ""Are they being being triggered or are they natural? That's something we don't know,"" Arkansas Geological Survey scientist Scott Ausbrook said Sunday. The chances of so many temblors in the region in such a short time are ""Powerball kind of odds,"" Ausbrook said. ""What was unusual was to have four different areas in the state to be active in the same week."" More than two dozen quakes recorded since Wednesday have been centered north of Morrilton, Arkansas. The strongest, on Wednesday and Thursday nights, had reported magnitudes of 3.5 and 3.4. ""Right now all we've gotten reports of is shaking stuff and rattling shelves, but people are definitely noticing them,"" Ausbrook said. Measuring the magnitude of eathquakes . Solving the mystery is important because of suspicion the quakes could be related to natural gas exploration nearby using hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, he said. ""The best probability at this point is they are natural, but we can't rule out the possibility that there may be a relationship,"" Ausbrook said. A swarm of hundreds of earthquakes centered near Guy, Arkansas, ended two years ago after state regulators imposed a moratorium on new injection wells in the area. Two operating injection wells, just outside of the moratorium area, are about 8 miles from some of the quakes. ""I can't say at this time there's not a connection, but given the distance from those wells, it would be pretty amazing,"" Ausbrook said. One natural explanation would be a fault running through the area that makes a sharp turn, where ""you would expect more strain to accumulate,"" Ausbrook said.

"(CNN) -- Just over 24 hours after Super Typhoon smashed into the coast of Tacloban just two blocks from their hotel, the three-man team of professional storm chasers knew they had to get out. Outside, the water was more than waist deep, roads were clogged with debris, and one of their team members, Mark Thomas, had a deep gash to his leg, inflicted by a jagged piece of sheet metal that sliced into him, unseen beneath the swirling water. ""On Saturday we realized we needed to get the hell out of there as quickly as possible, mostly because of Mark's leg,"" said James Reynolds, founder of Earth Uncut Productions. He and Thomas were joined by Josh Morgerman, who runs iCyclone.com, a storm chasing site from the U.S. When the typhoon hit they were working with CNN anchor Andrew Stevens and producer Tim Schwarz. Super Typhoon Haiyan struck the capital of Leyte province in the eastern Philippines early Friday morning, creating ""blinding rain, absolutely ferocious winds (and) deafening sounds,"" Reynolds said. ""Windows were blowing out, water was cascading down the staircases in the hotel, flooding all the rooms."" After a couple of hours, the storm surge hit, flooding the hotel's ground floor before conditions eased enough to venture outside. Dazed survivors with cuts and bruises searched for anything they could salvage beneath the wreck of their homes. However, Reynolds said on day two, some were raiding abandoned shops for food and water. Pharmacies were being targeted, presumably for medication. He also saw some people carrying electrical appliances, useless in a town without electricity and covered in water. ""People in the Philippines are great and they're tough and they're good at fending for themselves. But the problem is in a situation like that, the more desperate people become for food and water, the more desperate their actions become,"" he said. A sense of foreboding was starting to set in, Reynolds said, as people started to realize that everything they had and knew had been wiped out. ""In the immediate aftermath I got the sense that a lot of people didn't quite realize how serious the situation was and how badly it would escalate,"" he said. ""Whilst we didn't personally feel threatened you could just sense it wouldn't take much."" ""I remember at one point looking at the security guard in the hotel and it wasn't because of any specific threat, but he had his gun in his hand, and he looked like he was anxious and preparing himself for something, and that was unnerving for me."" Back at their flooded hotel, the team planned a way to get out. They'd chosen the Alejandro Hotel because of its height -- at four stories it was one of the tallest buildings in Tacloban and they could see the airport from the roof. OPEN STORY: Haiyan's impact . They could also see kilometer after kilometer of flattened buildings and debris covering roads turning what is normally a six to seven kilometer car ride to the airport into potentially a seven-hour trek over collapsed buildings and trees. They were in their hotel room when they heard planes fly overhead. ""We rushed out of the room, sprinted up to the roof and watched the planes fly over the city. We were begging them, 'please land, please,' because we didn't know the state of the airport. When we saw one of the planes land, we thought, right, ok the airport's a viable option."" Reynolds and Morgerman set out, leaving an injured Thomas back at the hotel. They had handheld radios and within half an hour a call came from Thomas. He'd learned of another way out: a military staging post where the airforce was flying people out. iREPORT: Looking for loved ones . ""It was so uncertain -- we didn't want to give up our hotel room and food supplies because if we got to the staging post and they said sorry we couldn't help you we would have been in big trouble,"" Reynolds said. Leaving behind most of their belongings, they carried the bare minimum to the military checkpoint where they registered their names and were told: ""Yes, you can get out on an air force flight but you have to make your own way to their airport."" At that moment, a man Reynolds describes only as a general piped up: ""There is a helicopter coming, come with me."" ""We ran with him,"" Reynolds said. ""The chopper landed and we scrambled onto it and got ferried to the airport."" From there they boarded a C-130 with other survivors, and the bagged corpses of four people who didn't make it. They landed in Cebu and caught flights out of the Philippines. Thomas is currently being treated in hospital in Taipei. Back in Hong Kong, Reynolds said it was clear the people of Tacloban had no idea of what was coming. ""The Philippines isn't used to getting storm surges -- it's not usually such of an issue so this would have caught people by surprise. They don't associate typhoons with the rising water levels like that."" The day before, his team had bought enough food and water for one week. There were no queues and shelves were well stocked. ""It was like a usual day at the supermarket,"" Reynolds said. Asked whether he thought the message had got out that the storm could be the biggest ever to make landfall, he said, ""No, no, it can't have done.""","Storm chasers tell of dramatic escape from Tacloban after Super Typhoon .

"(CNN) -- What's that in the sky? Is it an asteroid? A comet? A lawn sprinkler? Turns out a newly discovered object is a little bit of all three -- minus the fact that you won't find many green lawns millions of miles from Earth -- NASA announced Friday. ""We were literally dumbfounded when we saw it,"" David Jewitt, who leads the team exploring the ""asteroid with six comet-like tails of dust radiating from it like spokes on a wheel."" ""It"" is P/2013 P5, which NASA described as an ""unusually fuzzy-looking object"" when it was spotted in August in our solar system's asteroid belt. The Hubble Space Telescope then focused on it, photographing it first in early September and then again 13 days later. By then, it looked completely different -- as if it had done a 180-degree flip, NASA said. ""Its tail structures change dramatically ... as it belches out dust,"" Jewitt, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, said in a news release. ""That also caught us by surprise. It's hard to believe we're looking at an asteroid."" Satellite falling to Earth . The first-of-its-kind discovery ""completely knocked out"" astounded astronomers, he added. Perhaps just as exciting is the expectation that this ""amazing object (is) almost certainly the first of many to come."" As Jewitt said: ""In astronomy, where you find one, you eventually find a whole bunch more."" The giant rock is about 1,400 feet wide and probably reaches surface temperatures of 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. For that reason, NASA thinks it's made of rock and not ice, like a typical comet is. Tens of billions of planets out there are like Earth . The streams of dust were ejected six times between April and September -- something that the NASA team members believe might have been caused by the asteroid spinning so fast that its surface, at times, broke apart. NASA is still watching P/2013 P5 -- which Jewitt says apparently is a fragment of a bigger asteroid that broke off approximately 200 million years ago -- to figure out exactly why it's doing what it's doing. One theory is that this is one way that asteroids die. The full findings were published on November 7 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Big asteroid past Earth and will again in 19 years . CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","The Hubble Space Telescope focuses on object in the solar system's asteroid belt .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams retained her U.S. Open title with a hard-fought 7-5 6-7 6-1 victory over Victoria Azarenka in a gripping final at Flushing Meadows Sunday. The world No.1 was thoroughly extended by Azarenka before clinching her 17th grand slam crown in two hours 45 minutes of enthralling action on a windswept Arthur Ashe Stadium Court. Williams, who twice served for the championship in the second set, made no mistake at 5-1 in the decider, taking advantage of her second match point when her opponent from Belarus hit long. It ended brave resistance from the second seed, who had trailed by two breaks of service in the second set before hitting back to win a tense tiebreaker 8-6. Fifth title in New York . But Serena was not to be denied her fifth U.S. Open title, opening up a double break advantage in the third set, which this time she was not to relinquish. At 31 she is the the oldest winner of the hard court grand slam in the Open era, and the American acknowledged just how tough a match she had been given. ""Victoria you played unbelievable,"" Williams said. ""What a great match and a great person. It's an honor to play against you."" she told the crowd after winning her second grand slam title this year, having also lifted the French Open in June. Azarenka, beaten by Williams in the final in New York for the second straight year, admitted a second defeat was hard to take. ""It's a tough loss but being in the final against the best player, who deserves the win, it's incredible,"" the Australian Open champion said. ""I gave it everything I had. I fought hard but well deserved. Congratulations Serena."" Bumper check . Williams picked up a check for $3.6 million, including a $1 million bonus for winning events in the build-up to the final slam of the season -- though she lost to Azarenka in the Cincinnati final last month, just one of four defeats for her in 2013. She is the first woman to successfully defend the title since Kim Clijsters in 2010, and was runner-up in the 2011 final in New York. Williams had lost only 16 games in six matches as she cruised to the final, but Azarenka was made of sterner stuff and after dropping her service in the very first game, immediately broke back to set the pattern of the final. Williams finally broke through again in the 11th game and served out for the opener, but hopes of a straight sets victory were dashed by another stirring Azarenka fightback. Williams looked on the verge of tears after her failure to close out the match and threw down her racket in frustration as Azarenka leveled at one set all. Great champion . But great champion that she is, Williams quickly regained control to the delight of the 20,000 spectators on the show court. Earlier Sunday, Leander Paes became the oldest man to win a grand slam title when he paired with Radek Stepanek to win the men's doubles title. The 40-year-old Indian and his Czech partner, the fourth seeds, beat Alexander Peya of Austria and Brazil's Bruno Soares, the second seeds, 6-1 6-3. Paes and Stepanek were winners of the 2012 Australian Open title and had ended the hopes of top seeds Bob and Mike Bryan, who were hoping to complete a calendar year grand slam, in the semifinals. Paes had won the U.S. Open title with Martin Damm in 2006 and Lukas Dlouhy in 2009, and now has eight men's doubles trophies at the majors as well as six mixed doubles crowns. ""I think the best advice I can give to anyone for doubles is get a partner from the Czech Republic!"" Paes told the official tournament website. ""Radek helped me to get to be the oldest man to ever win a grand slam in the Open era. I thank him for that, and we are definitely not done. I'm going after 41 now, 42, and then 43.""

Much of the violence included Sunnis squaring off with Shiites and the Shiite-led government. Most of the casualties Monday were in and around Baghdad, where 11 car bombs exploded, mostly in Shiite neighborhoods, Also, one bomb exploded in the central Baghdad commercial area of Bab al-Sharqi, near street vendors.

"Beijing (CNN) -- China's leaders begin a highly-anticipated four-day meeting on Saturday that is expected to shed light on the direction the world's second largest economy is likely to take in coming years. The big question for the gathering -- officially called the third plenary session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist party of China -- is how hard Xi will push for reforms. Possible changes include an overhaul of tax, land and family planning policies; solutions to control an explosion in local government debt; restructuring China's massive state-owned enterprises; and looser controls on foreign investment. CNN's Beijing bureau chief, Jaime FlorCruz, spoke to Cai Hongbin, the dean of Guanghua School of Management at Peking University about what to expect: . What are the challenges that China faces now? The Chinese economy faces many challenges, in the realms of urbanization, industrial upgrading, changing into more efficient market infrastructure, and reforming the financial sector. There are a lot of problems, but many of these are manageable. The Chinese economy is like a race car making a turn. You want to be very focused to stay on course and maintain constant speed. If you slam on the brake while turning, you may easily lose control and get into trouble. But China's economic growth has been slowing down -- isn't that alarming? Indeed, the Chinese economy has been slowing down for the past three years but recent data and other evidence suggests this is changing. I am pretty optimistic that the Chinese economy will be back on a relatively strong growth track, and then things will move forward. The key is while maintaining a healthy growth rate, we need to further economic reforms. What further economic reforms should China take? In the very near term, the Chinese government should focus on the urbanization process and reform the ""hukou"" (residence registration) system -- to make sure that the new migrant workers coming to the cities have equal opportunities to education, jobs, access to social safety nets and public services. The other key issue is to improve business environment, and this requires government reforms, so that governments don't interfere too much, control too much, interfere with the market too much and control resources too much. Some say that China needs political reforms as much as it needs to further economic reforms. What kind of reform on the political side can we expect? The economic reforms cannot be separated from the political reforms. And that is a common understanding in China now. In my view, for China in the current situation, the most important political reforms are in the government reforms. And in the official government documents, it has been made clear that they want to redefine the three relationships: the relationship between the government and the market, letting markets play a more fundamental role in resource allocation; redefining the relationship between the government and the society, to let social organizations play more important role in society; and then, redefining the relationship between the central and the local governments, to make sure different levels of government all have the right incentives to push forward healthy economic growth and social progress. Some say China must keep the magic ""8"" in GDP growth to sustain economic growth and social stability. What do you think? A certain number of growth rate, like 8%, is not a magic number. In fact, I would suggest that the government should downplay it, or even don't publish at all the target of GDP growth. In a market economy -- for a complex economy like China -- it is very hard to plan what's going to be the growth rate for next year, or the next five years. The new government is looking for real solutions. So changing the behavior of local governments in China will be the key in changing the growth model. Starting from the central government, getting rid of the GDP target and then, putting in a systematic package of reform to change the local government's incentives, so that the local officials will be more focused on how to develop the local business and market, how to improve the environment, how to make the city more liveable and changing their incentives to these areas, instead of trying to attract big projects or getting impressive GDP numbers. How worried should we be in terms of Chinese housing bubble? How big is it and will it burst? It is something that we need to be concerned about, but I don't think the whole housing sector in China and all housing prices in all of Chinese cities, are out of control. Overall, I think, the housing price in large cities is something that we need to be concerned about, but if we handle this issue well, it is a manageable problem, and it will not necessarily lead to a bubble that will eventually burst and will cause all sorts of financial issues. How risky is it for China to be pushing further along market-oriented reform? When you reform, you meet challenges along the way, you face difficulties. In some sense it is more difficult to push forward now than early on, because in these reforms, you need to deal with very complex interest groups, you need to make a lot of compromises and difficult trade-offs. That is a difficult thing to do, but not to push forward is even more risky. The Chinese leaders realize the urgency of pushing forward economic reforms. How will the coming Third Party Plenum be considered successful? The meeting will be considered successful if it points to the right direction and take further reforms, lay some cornerstones so that you can clearly see that in the next five to 10 years, the current government will push through series of economic reforms -- so that the Chinese economy will be on the right developmental and growth track; so that we that the economy will become more efficient and strong, the society more open and progressive, the government more efficient, less corrupt and more productive in terms of managing the economy and the society.","Cai Hongbin says that China's economy is like a race car making a turn .
Need to maintain constant speed; if you slam on the brake you may easily lose control, he says .
Economic reforms cannot be separated from the political reforms, he adds .
No magic numbers for Chinese economy; need to find real solutions ."
"New Delhi (CNN) -- A senior official from India's governing Congress party suffered brutal treatment at the hands of Maoist insurgents during an audacious and deadly attack on a political motorcade over the weekend, police said Monday. The assault Saturday by hundreds guerrillas on the convoy of Congress politicians in a forested area of the eastern state of Chhattisgarh killed at least 24 people and wounded 33, according to authorities. Among the dead was Mahendra Karma, a top local party leader and the founder of a controversial anti-Maoist militia named Salwa Judam, or the Purification Hunt. His stance against the insurgents appears to have prompted them to take a vicious approach when they captured him. They fired 30 to 40 bullets into Karma's body and smashed his head with the butt of their guns after killing him, said Ram Niwas, the state police chief. ""He was beaten brutally even after his death,"" he said. Niwas said as many as 500 insurgents had participated in the attack. Police had previously estimated that around 200 attackers had raided the convoy. At least 16 cars in the motorcade of local Congress leaders were passing through the area when the insurgents set off a land mine and opened fire on them, police said. Among the dead were eight policemen, three laborers and some car drivers. Searching for suspects . Authorities haven't reported any arrests so far, but investigations are under way. Security forces are combing the area where the raid took place, Niwas said Monday. A judicial inquiry has been ordered into Saturday's assault. If any failings on the part of the police are found, ""appropriate action will be taken,"" Niwas said when asked about his response to criticism of security in the area. On Sunday, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited a hospital in Raipur, the capital of Chhattisgarh, where some of those wounded in the attack were being treated. He was accompanied by the Congress party chief, Sonia Gandhi. ""We will pursue the perpetrators of this crime with urgency, and I can assure the nation that the government is committed to bringing them to justice,"" Singh said. India's internal threat . Saturday's severe attack came barely three days after Singh announced what he called a significant decline in killings by left-wing insurgents, whom the federal government describes as the nation's gravest internal security threat. ""The quantum of violence as well as the resultant killings perpetrated by the left-wing extremist groups in 2012 declined significantly for the second successive year,"" said a report Singh released on Wednesday to mark the fourth anniversary of his second term in office. He insisted his government has continued to provide public infrastructure and services in tribal districts hit by Maoist extremism. The rebels, officials say, aim to seize power through an armed struggle. Since the 1960s, the militants have said they are fighting for the dispossessed. Authorities suspect that the Maoists enjoy support not only in the poorest areas and in tribal communities but also among young people and intellectuals. In addition to targeting police, alleged police informers and people they call ""class enemies,"" the insurgents also are believed to have attacked infrastructure such as roads, bridges, railways, and power and telecommunication networks.","Most people in the convoy attacked by Maoists were from India's Congress party .

"(CNN) -- Tina Weirather is one to watch at the Sochi Olympics. Weirather won a maiden World Cup giant slalom in Val d'Isere on Sunday and also extended her lead in the overall standings. She outclassed the field in the French resort, too, beating her closest rival by 0.73 seconds following a commanding first run. A good showing in Russia in February would be especially sweet for the 24-year-old from Liechtenstein -- whose parents were World Cup racers -- since she missed the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver with a knee injury. ""It feels awesome for me to get a first win in the giant slalom,"" Weirather, fourth in Saturday's downhill and a Super-G winner last week in Switzerland, told reporters. Weirather's mom, Hanni Wenzel, captured two gold medals at the 1980 Olympics and claimed 33 World Cup victories but never triumphed in Val d'Isere. And Weirather joked: ""I didn't know there was a piste in this world where my mum hadn't won. It's good we've now got it in the family."" Switzerland's Lara Gut was the distant second-place finisher, followed by Sweden's Maria Pietilae-Holmner. Reigning slalom champion Mikaela Shiffrin of the U.S. finished eighth and hasn't been on the podium since early December. But she said she was ""very happy"" with her performance. ""I was really tired coming from the U.S. to here and I had to re-think how I was doing things, making sure I was getting my recoveries,"" the 18-year-old told reporters. ""Before this race I actually got some rest and I felt a lot better today, which just means that I have to ski faster. So it's good and bad, but I'm very happy with a top-10."" Giant slalom world champion Tessa Worley of France missed the race and is out of the Olympics after injuring her knee last week. Four-time overall champion Lindsey Vonn didn't compete, either. She didn't finish the downhill Saturday and said her right knee was still bothering her. Back-to-back wins for Hirscher . In Alta Badia, Italy, Marcel Hirscher tamed one of the toughest giant slalom courses in the world and said it was a confidence booster to beat American Ted Ligety. Hirscher made it back-to-back giant slalom victories, with France's Alexis Pinturault 0.35 seconds behind and Ligety a further 0.23 seconds adrift. ""If only you knew how bad my skiing and my feeling were yesterday,"" Hirscher told reporters. ""I doubt anyone would ever believe I could win today. Somehow I still showed some really good skiing in the end, and I couldn't be happier. ""It was really, really important for me to win when Ted is competitive. I have done everything I possibly could to get closer to Ted and it's tough to get faster ad faster, but it was worth it."" Ligety still had reason to celebrate, claiming his 33rd giant slalom podium to tie Austria's Benny Raich for third on the all-time list. He thus rebounded after missing a gate and not completing the giant slalom in Val d'Isere last week. That ended his four-race winning streak in the discipline. ""I think I could have pushed a bit more, especially in the first run, but it's okay,"" Ligety told reporters. ""It's how it goes."" Hirscher increased his lead in the giant slalom standings to 60 points over Ligety and pulled to within 100 points of Norway's Aksel Lund Svindal in the overall standings. Lund Svindal was 13th Sunday.","Tina Weirather crushed the field to win a women's giant slalom in Val d'Isere .

"(CNN) -- A career criminal has been charged in the March killing of a 6-month-old Chicago girl, the city's police superintendent said Monday at a news conference. Garry McCarthy said Koman Willis has been charged with first-degree murder and aggravated battery in the death of Jonylah Watkins, whose death was held up nationally as a new low in Chicago's gun violence. Willis, 33, is a gang member with at least 38 prior arrests, McCarthy said. He added that police think Willis was seeking revenge for the alleged theft of a video game system by Jonylah's father, Jonathan, who was also shot March 11. Willis turned himself in Saturday afternoon. He came in with an attorney because he knew police were looking for him, McCarthy said. The superintendent said this was not a case of gang violence even though the suspect and the victim's father have ties to gangs. ""We believe the motivation was the burglary,"" he said. He said it was unlikely Watkins, 29, will be charged with theft. Lead investigator Kevin Duffin said police were able to identify new witnesses last week. ""They provided some key information that got the ball rolling,"" he said. No weapon or getaway van has been recovered, police said. McCarthy said ""we're still not at that point"" to say that Willis acted alone but no other charges are expected soon. Jonathan Watkins, who was seriously wounded in the shooting, didn't attend the news conference. ""The family spent the day at the grave site,"" Corey Brooks, pastor of the New Beginnings Church of Chicago, said, adding he called the family when he learned that Willis had being charged. ""They are very grateful and thankful. Hopefully they will be able to put this part behind them and go forward.""

"(CNN) -- Facing weak support for U.S. military action, President Barack Obama said Monday that a plan to have Syria hand its chemical arsenal over to international control could avert American strikes ""if it's real."" ""It's certainly a positive development when the Russians and Syrians both make gestures towards dealing with these chemical weapons,"" President Barack Obama told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday. But Obama said the threat of American force would remain, ""And we don't want just a stalling or delaying tactic to put off the pressure that we have on there right now."" Obama was making the rounds of television interviews in an effort to shore up support for a congressional resolution that would authorize him to launch punitive raids on Syria, which his administration accuses of using poison gas against opposition forces and civilians. He's scheduled to address the nation Tuesday night, and that speech is still on, he said. But a CNN/ORC International Poll out Monday found Americans strongly opposed to attacking Syria. Of the 1,022 people polled between Friday and Sunday, 59% said Congress should not authorize military action, and 72% said American strikes would achieve no significant goals. In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid postponed a procedural vote that had been scheduled for Wednesday after the proposal floated by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. An aide said the Russia proposal on chemical weapons is serious and fluid enough that senators do not want to lock themselves into a position on Syria just yet. The Russian proposal came after comments by Secretary of State John Kerry earlier Monday -- remarks that the State Department said were meant to be rhetorical, but which Lavrov proposed concretely. Asked during a stop in London whether there was anything Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government could do or offer that would stop an attack, Kerry said that al-Assad ""could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week"" -- adding, ""He isn't about to do it, and it can't be done, obviously."" Syria's chemical arsenal at a glance . Soon afterward, Lavrov said Russia, Syria's leading ally, urged al-Assad to do just that if it would avert a U.S. military response. And Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem, who was meeting with Lavrov in Moscow, told reporters that Damascus welcomes the proposal. ""We are also confident in the wisdom of the Russian government, which is trying to prevent an American aggression against our people,"" Moallem said. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Washington remained ""highly skeptical"" of the Syrian regime. But Obama told CNN, ""We have not seen these kinds of gestures up until now,"" suggesting his threat of force had prompted ""some interesting conversations."" ""We're going to run this to ground,"" the president said. ""And John Kerry and the rest of my national security team will engage with the Russians and the international community to see, can we arrive at something that is enforceable and serious."" 'Expect everything' if U.S. attacks, al-Assad says . Washington accuses Syria's government of launching a chemical attack outside Damascus on August 21, killing more than 1,400 people, hundreds of women and children among them. That led to Obama's call for military action, with the American leader arguing that strikes are needed to enforce a longstanding international taboo on the use of poison gas. Syria denies its forces unleashed chemical weapons, and al-Assad said government troops were on the receiving end of a gas attack. Al-Assad told ""CBS This Morning"" interviewer Charlie Rose on Monday that the West lacks ""a single shred of evidence"" that his government was behind the attack. Samples collected by U.N. weapons inspectors are still being tested, and even then, the inspection team was charged only with determining whether chemical weapons were used -- not who used them. But Washington says it knows the trajectory of the rockets used to deliver the gas, that Syrian commanders ordered troops to don gas masks and learned of fears by top Syrian officials that U.N. inspectors would discover evidence of the attack. Al-Assad warned Monday that his country would lash out in potentially unpredictable ways after a U.S. military strike, telling CBS, ""You should expect everything."" He sidestepped the question of whether he would use chemical weapons against Western forces, but invoked the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington to warn that military action has unforeseen consequences. ""It is difficult for anyone to tell you what is going to happen,"" he said. ""It's an area where everything is on the brink of explosion."" But on CNN's ""The Situation Room,"" Obama snapped back that Syria is no threat to the United States. ""Mr. Assad doesn't have a lot of capability,"" Obama said. ""He has capability relative to children. He has capability relative to an opposition that is still getting itself organized and are not professional, trained fighters. He doesn't have a credible means to threaten the United States."" The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria's civil war, now 2Â½ years old. Another 76 deaths were reported on Monday, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. Of Monday's fatalities, 37 were in Damascus and its suburbs, where the August 21 attack took place, the LCC reported. French intelligence believes that al-Assad ordered the attack because he feared a major rebel attack from the suburbs that could have endangered his control of Damascus and the route leading to the city's airport, according to a French Defense Ministry official who briefed reporters on background Monday. But a German newspaper reported Sunday that German intelligence intercepted communications that indicate al-Assad had repeatedly denied his military approval for chemical attacks. Calls to intervene have been shadowed by bitter memories of Iraq, when the Bush administration said that country's hidden arsenal of chemical and biological weapons and a clandestine nuclear weapons program posed a threat that required a U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Iraq was later found to have disbanded its weapons programs under U.N. sanctions in the 1990s. Lawmakers in Britain, which committed troops to Iraq, voted to preclude their military from participating in any strike. French President Francois Hollande supports a military response, but French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said in a statement Monday that the Russian proposal ""deserves a thorough examination."" Fabius said, however, that the Security Council needs to oversee the process; that it should start immediately; and the plan shouldn't let anyone off the hook for ordering a chemical attack. At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he is also considering asking the Security Council to demand the Syrian government immediately hand over its chemical weapons to be destroyed. Ban said Monday that if U.N. inspectors confirm the use of chemical weapons in Syria, it would be an ""abominable crime"" worthy of international response -- but he has previously warned against ""further militarization of the conflict"" in Syria. Could a 'goof' be a solution? A senior State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Kerry and Lavrov were on a previously scheduled call before Kerry flew back from London when Lavrov brought up his remarks. ""I saw your comments this morning,"" Lavrov said to Kerry, the State Department official said. The Russian foreign minister said he would speak about the issue but played down the idea that a proposal was on the table during the 14-minute conversation, the official said. Kerry told Lavrov that the United States ""is not going to 'play games,'"" the official said. ""If there is a serious proposal, we will take a look."" One U.S. official called Kerry's remarks a ""major goof,"" adding that America's top diplomat ""clearly went off script."" And several State Department representatives tried to clarify Kerry's remarks later in the day, calling them a ""rhetorical argument."" ""His point was that this brutal dictator with a history of playing fast and loose with the facts cannot be trusted to turn over chemical weapons. Otherwise he would have done so long ago,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. ""That's why the world faces this moment."" The prospect of a diplomatic deal is likely going to make the Obama administration's attempts to make a case before Congress even more difficult, said Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Lawmakers who are already debating whether to pass resolutions authorizing military action now may want to rewrite them, he said. ""It's going to obviously throw a monkey wrench in the gears on a number of things,"" he said. But it got a hopeful reception in Congress, where the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said she would welcome Syria's chemical disarmament ""to prevent an international strike."" ""I believe that Russia can be most effective in encouraging the Syrian president to stop any use of chemical weapons and place all his chemical munitions, as well as storage facilities, under United Nations control until they can be destroyed,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California. Feinstein's House counterpart, Michigan Republican Rep. Mike Rogers, said Washington should review the Russian proposal to ""see if there's any teeth to their bark."" And Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, the ranking Republican on the chamber's Foreign Relations Committee, said the best way to reach a diplomatic solution to the conflict ""is for us as a nation to stay strong."" ""If it is real, and if Syria is willing to make immediate concrete steps, certainly that's something worth looking at,"" Corker said. ""But it's very difficult to tell if it's that or just a way of creating a fog around this whole issue."" Sen. Jack Reed, a leading Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said the Lavrov proposal is a ""distinct change"" in Russia's stance, ""going from sort of defenders of the regime to now saying there's a real serious problem with chemical weapons in Syria."" ""It is very thoughtful,"" said Reed, of Rhode Island, who described himself as undecided on Syria. ""It goes to the essential objective that we should have, which is to deter the use of chemical weapons. This should not be about trying to settle a civil war raging in Syria."" CNN's Michael Pearson, David Simpson, Jamie Crawford, Dana Bash, Elise Labott, Alex Felton, Jill Dougherty, Jim Sciutto, Larry Shaughnessy, Joe Sterling and Jake Tapper contributed to this report.","Russian proposal a ""positive development"" but can't be a ""delaying tactic,"" Obama says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two Chinese fishing vessels came ""dangerously close"" to a U.S. military ship in the Yellow Sea off the coast of China last week -- the fifth such incident in the past few months, two U.S. officials told CNN Tuesday. The USNS Victorious is an unarmed ocean surveillance ship operated by a civilian crew. The officials -- who could not be identified because the incident has not yet been formally announced -- said the two Chinese boats approached the USNS Victorious, a military sealift command ship, in international waters Friday in the Yellow Sea, which lies between China and North and South Korea. Over a period of several hours, the officials said, the Chinese vessels repeatedly came close to the Victorious in what was described as deliberate maneuvers -- once coming within 30 yards of the U.S. vessel. Both officials said the Chinese vessels came to a dead halt in front of the Victorious at one point, in heavy fog, causing the U.S. ship to have to come to a dangerous sudden stop. The officials did not know the exact size of the Chinese ships but described them as being smaller than the 235-foot long U.S. vessel. The crew of the Victorious turned its fire hoses on to keep the Chinese ships away but did not directly spray them at the smaller boats, one official said. The Victorious also sounded its danger alarm system and radioed for assistance to a larger Chinese fisheries service vessel nearby. That vessel did shine a light on the small Chinese vessels but took no further action, the official said. The USNS Victorious is an unarmed ocean surveillance ship operated by a civilian mariner crew working for the Military Sealift Command. The mission is to conduct authorized undersea listening operations in international waters, according to the U.S. Navy. There is video of this latest incident, but it has not been released by the Pentagon. The Victorious was involved in another incident with a Chinese ship on March 4 in the Yellow Sea, when a Chinese Bureau of Fisheries Patrol vessel used a spotlight to illuminate the Victorious and crossed the U.S. vessel's bow ""at a range of about 1,400 yards in darkness without notice or warning,"" according to a Pentagon statement. The following day, a Chinese Y-12 maritime surveillance aircraft conducted 12 fly-bys of the Victorious at an altitude of about 400 feet and a range of 500 yards, the Pentagon said. On March 6, a Chinese frigate approached the USNS Impeccable, another U.S. ocean surveillance ship, ""and proceeded to cross its bow at a range of approximately 100 yards,"" the Pentagon said. Two hours later, a Chinese Y-12 aircraft conducted 11 fly-bys of the Impeccable at an altitude of 600 feet and a range from 100-300 feet, the statement said. Two days later, five Chinese ships surrounded and harassed the Impeccable in the South China Sea. The crew of the Impeccable turned its fire hoses on the Chinese boats, which also moved in front of the U.S. vessel and dropped pieces of wood in the water. The United States protested the actions to Beijing as ""unprofessional."" Last week's incident came soon after U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Gary Roughead returned from a visit to China last month. He was there to discuss the safety of U.S. and Chinese maritime operations. After the Impeccable incidents, the U.S. Navy provided armed warships to escort some USNS ships in the region, but as one of the officials said, ""it's international waters, we should not have to do that."" The Chinese claim much of those waters as an economic zone over which they have sole authority.","Chinese boats force U.S. ship to come to dangerous sudden stop, U.S. officials say .

"(CNN) -- A grainy black and white photo of Trayvon Martin's body and school records for George Zimmerman were among court documents that prosecutors in the controversial case said they mistakenly released Thursday. Special Prosecutor Angela Corey's office later issued a statement asking reporters to ""please disregard and do not use the information contained in the initial e-mail. It was inadvertently attached."" The photo and records were among 76 documents released by Corey's office Thursday. The state attorney's office later sent reporters a redacted version of the court documents, which did not include the Martin photo or the Zimmerman school records. In June, Circuit Judge Kenneth R. Lester Jr. ruled that photographs of Martin's body after the February 26 shooting would not be released to the public. Judge in Zimmerman case says he won't step aside . Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder in the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was shot and killed while walking through Zimmerman's Sanford, Florida, neighborhood in February. Zimmerman says he shot Martin in self-defense during a struggle, but prosecutors say he racially profiled the youth and ignored a 911 dispatcher's advice not to follow him. In his six-page order sealing some court documents in June, Lester noted the media scrutiny of the case. ""News stories have been routinely disseminated presenting opinion and rumors as fact. Any person who has logged onto a news website in the last three months has at the least seen a headline relating to the case,"" he wrote.

"(CNN) -- Jim Shepperd was just crossing the Howard Frankland Bridge from Tampa to St. Petersburg when the winds whipped furiously and the first named storm of the hurricane season began its one-two punch on the Tampa Bay area. By the time he and his chow-shepherd mix, Aussie, made it home to Gulfport, Tropical Storm Andrea was thrashing his neighborhood. Just down the street, a tornado touched down, felling a massive 200-year-old cedar tree. ""There were a lot of trees down,"" the hairstylist said Friday morning. ""We're lucky. We're OK."" By 5 p.m. ET, Andrea's heavy rain had moved on, targeting a broad swath of the East Coast. The storm, categorized as a post-tropical cyclone with sustained winds of up to 45 mph, was about 55 miles northeast of Raleigh, North Carolina, and continuing on its predicted path up the Northeast Coast. Forecasters say it's expected to drench 13 states from Georgia to Maine. Meteorologists want everyone in Andrea's path to know this: The storm's biggest danger will probably be flash floods. The National Weather Service offers tips on what to do in a flooding situation. In short, road beds may be washed out under flood waters, so never drive through flooded roadways. At 11 a.m. Friday, the National Hurricane Center said Andrea was packing 45-mph winds and was about 50 miles southwest of Fayetteville, North Carolina, and 90 miles west of Wilmington, North Carolina. Andrea is expected to produce 2 to 4 inches of rain in central and eastern North Carolina. Up to 2 inches are expected over portions of South Carolina. Farther north on Friday, a flood watch area includes Washington, which the National Weather Service predicts could get 6 inches of rain Friday, and New York, where forecasters say 1 to 2 inches of rain an hour could fall at times into Saturday. Even Maine's coast, including Portland, could see as much as 3 inches of rain by the time the weekend is done. Follow the storm on CNN.com's hurricane tracker . As of 8 a.m., Andrea's projected path is similar to that of Tropical Storm Debby nearly a year ago. Debby dumped up to 2 feet of rain onto the low-lying areas, causing extensive flooding in some coastal towns.

"(CNN) -- A recent study with a catchy headline about the most stressful jobs of 2013 found its way to the soft hour of news this week. The annual study by careercast.com created some buzz in the online water cooler and I was asked to appear on the ""Today"" show to talk about it. Colleagues e-mailed me and posted on my Facebook page about where their chosen professions ranked. My media friends couldn't help noticing that public relations professionals, reporters and photojournalists all made it into the top 10 for stress. The ""study,"" referred to in quotes in some of the commentary, considered some logical criteria to come up with these rankings. Proximity to risk of death (yours or others'), travel, deadlines, working in the public eye and physical demands all racked up points on the stress scale. And there's no arguing that military personnel, firefighters and police officers -- all high-rankers on the most-stressed list -- are exposed to higher stakes than your typical seamstress (holder of the second-least stressful job slot). The job that snagged the ""least stressful"" slot, according to the survey, was ""university professor,"" a designation that caused outrage among people who actually hold that job. One commenter conceded that most academic jobs don't put you in personal danger (though you can argue that point), but anyone who's ever been around professors knows that faculty politics, difficult students and pressure to ""publish or perish"" can cause even the most calm character to crack. We could debate whether these designations make any sense. And whether every police officer, firefighter and member of the military faces the same amount of stress. But let's make sure we are having the right conversation. How many people choose a profession based on how high the stress level is? And how can you measure stress objectively? If you're prone to stress, perhaps you're just as likely to feel stressed out whether you work as a librarian, a massage therapist or a commercial airline pilot (No. 4 on the stress list). People choose their line of work for a lot of reasons. For those who are committed to making our communities and the world safer and healthier for the rest of us, minimizing stress is probably not so high on their list of criteria. And it shouldn't be. Folks who choose helping jobs that may have a high level of stress are fueled by other motivators, like wanting their work to have meaning. They aren't deterred by the fact that their job will likely come with stress. And some people are simply by their own nature and personalities drawn to work that may be to others, dauntingly stressful. How many FBI agents do you think would prefer a gig as an audiologist (sixth-least stressful job)? When I talk to men and women in their 50s and 60s who've decided to take on encore careers as teachers, they tell me that the work is often exhausting and stressful. They are on their feet all day, often with inadequate resources, with kids who are themselves highly stressed; even those who come from leadership roles in other sectors say they've never worked harder. Yet they almost always tell me that doing something that matters to others -- and that puts them in touch with young people every day -- compensates for the added stress. The same is true of those tackling some of the world's most intractable problems. When I talk to Stephen and Elizabeth Alderman, whose foundation trains health-care professionals around the world to work with victims of trauma, or Judith Broder, who founded The Soldiers Project, which works with returning veterans, they rarely talk about stress. Instead they talk about how they are compelled to do what they do, because moving the needle even a fraction is better than doing nothing. Rather than discouraging people to take on jobs that might have a lot of stress, let's instead encourage those who are designed for those jobs to do them. And let's make sure to support our friends and family members who go down these paths. It's hard to grab headlines in the crowded space of morning television, but a good survey with a catchy title will always do that. So let's use these kinds of surveys to have the right kinds of conversations. Like why so many jobs that keep us safe and healthy, and that care for our children and the environment rarely show up on lists of the most highly compensated jobs. Now there's a conversation I'd most like to be having. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marci Alboher.","Marci Alboher: Annual list of most stressful jobs drew attention .

"(CNN) -- A police search at a Cleveland, Ohio, property where the remains of 11 women were found, as well as an adjoining property, turned up no additional human remains, authorities said Wednesday. Six members of the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office's office were on standby Wednesday as investigators returned to the home to dig by hand, according to a coroner's spokesman. The digging focused on areas on the property of Anthony Sowell, a registered sex offender who served 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to attempted rape, as well as a property next door. ""Investigators removed various items that will be examined for investigative value,"" Cleveland police Lt. Thomas Stacho said in a statement. No more remains were found, he said, and no further search of either home or yard is planned. Federal agents, meanwhile, have nearly completed a timeline tracing Sowell's whereabouts from his days in the military and beyond, Scott Wilson, spokesman for the FBI's Cleveland office, told CNN. Cleveland homicide detectives asked the FBI to trace Sowell's life from the time he joined the Marines at age 18 to his life in Ohio. In the military, Sowell was based in California, North Carolina and even Japan before moving back to Ohio after spending eight years in the Marines. ""We're looking for any unsolved crimes to match what happened here,"" Wilson said. Given the number of bodies found at Sowell's home, crime experts have told CNN, it wouldn't be uncommon for authorities to look for links to other unsolved cases. Police and the FBI have said they're looking at the unsolved murders of three women in East Cleveland to determine if they share any similarities with the remains of 11 women found at Sowell's home between October 29 and November 3. Sowell faces five counts of aggravated murder, rape, felonious assault and kidnapping in connection with the deaths. In addition, police in Coronado, California, are attempting to determine if Sowell is linked to a 1979 rape there. Sowell's DNA will be entered into a national database to see whether it can be linked to any unsolved crimes. The timeline is just a start, Wilson said. ""We'll take several weeks to a month before we get all these leads out to our other offices for them to take a look at."" Investigators returned to Sowell's home to search it and the adjacent property on Friday and Saturday. They used thermal-imaging equipment and ground-penetrating radar and marked several areas outside the home with spray paint. The search Wednesday focused on areas identified during the recent use of thermal imaging equipment and radar technology, Stacho said. Wednesday's search was conducted by Cleveland police and the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office, the FBI and Cleveland's Department of Building and Housing.","NEW: Search at home and adjoining property turns up no additional bodies, police say .

"(CNN) -- Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas named the president of a West Bank university as his new prime minister Sunday, a top aide said. Rami Hamdallah has been asked to form a new Cabinet, Abbas adviser Sabri Saidam told CNN. The British-educated linguist is now the president of An-Najah National University in Nablus, West Bank. Hamdallah will replace Salaam Fayyad, who has led a caretaker government since Abbas accepted his resignation in April. Fayyad's decision to step down was viewed as a step toward the possible establishment of a unity government between the two main Palestinian factions, Fatah and Hamas. According to a profile on the An-Najah website, Hamdallah has been president of the university since August 1998. He is also the secretary-general of the Palestinian Central Elections Commission and head of the Palestinian stock exchange. He received a doctorate in applied linguistics from the University of Lancaster in 1988 and a master's from the University of Manchester in 1982. He graduated from the University of Jordan in 1980 with a degree in the English language.","Longtime West Bank university president chosen to form new government .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- It was not a quiet weekend for the prime minister of Japan, facing a diplomatic test abroad from China and questions at home about his leadership. Sitting down with CNN -- his first interview with an international television network -- Prime Minister Naoto Kan answered wide-ranging questions from pressing economic issues leading up to the upcoming APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) summit, to the diplomatic challenges from economic superpower China. Kan is a leader looking for a path out of a maze of domestic and international hurdles. He faces the monetary monster that is the sharply rising yen, that's prompting corporations like Toyota and Nissan to push production and jobs outside of Japan. Diplomatically, he is in the middle of a major test with China, a country wielding growing strength in the world economy, and a superpower that's just surpassed Japan in economic might. Japan is in an ongoing dispute with China over islands in the east China Sea. The islands, called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, are claimed as territories by both countries. ""As far as Japan is concerned,"" said Kan, ""there is no territorial issue connected to the Senkaku islands. In fact, the Senkaku islands are the inherent territory of Japan. That is recognized in our history and also by international law."" On September 7, the Japanese coast guard encountered a Chinese fishing crew in the islands' waters. The Chinese fishing vessel collided with two of the coast guard ships. Japan arrested the Chinese crew, quickly releasing the fishermen, but detaining the captain. His detention drew diplomatic fire from China, resulting in the cancellation of high-level ministerial meetings, most recently the abrupt cancellation of a scheduled meeting between Kan and Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Japan eventually released the captain, but relations continue to be strained. At the time of the September 7 incident, the Japanese coast guard captured both collisions on video. The video, deemed highly sensitive by the prime minister's office as it sought a smooth diplomatic out with China, was not released to the public, but shown to a select group of parliamentary lawmakers. Last Friday, the video appeared on YouTube and quickly went viral, sending Prime Minister Kan's office on the diplomatic defensive. Members of the prime minister's own party publicly began to question his handling of the matter. ""The fact that the video was leaked is a big mistake for the government,"" said legislator Hiroshi Kawauchi, of the prime minister's ruling Democratic Party of Japan. ""It is totally different from presenting it to the public in an official manner, and it leads (to) the people's further erosion of faith in Japan's government."" In the weekend interview with CNN, the prime minister defended his actions. ""I believe in any country that matters that relate to its territory provoke strong sentiments among people of that country. But I trust five years, 10 years down the road, people then will appreciate my cabinet dealt with the issue in a calm manner."" While the prime minister must try to contain the diplomatic damage with China, the most pressing matter in the week leading up to the APEC summit will be economic issues. Kan strongly defended his government's right to intervene in the currency market, in attempts to weaken the yen's sharp rise against the U.S. dollar. Japan had little choice, he suggested, since U.S. policy has been to boost the U.S. economy. ""With regard to the strong yen, the basic cause is the U.S. economy was undergoing changes with everything being skewed to a weak dollar,"" said Kan. ""Should there be excessive fluctuations in exchange markets, then we need to take resolute actions. In fact, we've already intervened in the market once. This remains an option we can take again."" How long Kan remains in his job is a constant question lobbed publicly by many pundits in Japan. The topic is a natural one, as there have been five Japanese prime ministers in four years. Prime Minister Kan asserted he's shown leadership and results, producing a rare-earth minerals partnership with Vietnam and the deepening of an economic pact with India. ""As we move forward by achieving concrete results, one after another, these will become more visible to the Japanese people. I still have three more years in my term in office. If I firmly implement policies, I trust I will be able to have the support of the Japanese people,"" Kan said.","Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan faces a maze of domestic and international issues .

"(CNN) -- Qantas Airways' fleet of Airbus A380 aircraft will remain grounded indefinitely after new problems with the planes' engines were uncovered over the weekend, the Australian airline's CEO said Monday. The fleet was grounded Thursday after one of four engines on one of the airliner's A380s failed in mid-flight, forcing an emergency landing. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said Friday that he hoped to have the fleet up in the air within 48 hours after completing engine safety checks, but backed away from that statement Monday, telling Australian Broadcasting Corp., ""We did find some issues that we are investigating further."" ""Hopefully over the next day or so we will have an understanding of when the aircraft can get back in the air,"" he added. ""Our top priority is making sure that we have the continued safe operation of the aircraft and if this takes a bit longer, it will take longer."" Thursday's incident began shortly after takeoff when the flight carrying 440 passengers and 26 crew members to Sydney, Australia, was forced to return to Singapore's Changi Airport. While above the western Indonesian island of Batam, part . of the engine's covering, or cowling, tore off. On Friday, Joyce described the incident as an ""engine issue"" rather than an incident caused by poor maintenance. He elaborated in his radio interview Monday, saying that on three of the fleet's Rolls-Royce engines ""what we found is slight anomalies, oil where it shouldn't be on the engines. And we are just trying to check what could the cause of that be."" ""These are new engines on new aircraft and they shouldn't have these issues at this stage and so it has given us an indication of an area for us to focus into,"" he said. Rolls-Royce said in a statement last week that it has been working closely with Qantas and air safety authorities ""to collect and understand information relating to the event and to determine suitable actions."" Qantas has six A380s -- the world's largest airliners -- in its fleet of 191 planes.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Virginia State University's football team is ineligible for post-season play, because VSU football players were accused of beating Winston-Salem State University quarterback Rudy Johnson. The ruling comes from the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association and follows the cancellation of Division II collegiate championship games this weekend. ""One suspect has admitted to his role in the attack and has been arrested on criminal assault charges,"" said WSSU Chancellor Donald Reaves. According to Forsyth County Sheriff's Office jail records, Virginia State player Lamont Britt, 22, was arrested Friday on a misdemeanor charge of assault inflicting injury. His bond was set at $7,500. It could not be determined late Friday if Britt had a lawyer. ""The University Police Department is attempting to identify the other VSU players who were involved,"" said Reaves. CIAA championship game cancelled after attack on Winston-Salem State QB . The alleged attack on Johnson occurred Friday during a Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association pre-championship game awards luncheon held at WSSU. ""Today's event was supposed to be a celebration for both teams and for all the players who were being recognized for an outstanding season. The actions from the Virginia State players certainly changed the outcome for everyone,"" said Reaves. After consulting with the leadership of both universities, the athletic association first canceling both the football and volleyball conferences this past weekend and followed up with a ban on post season football play for VSU Sunday evening. ""We did not make this decision lightly, as its impact is far and wide,"" said CIAA Commissioner Jacqie Carpenter. ""On the eve of such an important weekend for dozens of our student athletes, many of whom have waited a lifetime for such a moment, we are left to focus instead on what might have been."" Carpenter said the athletic association's main concern is the safety of the students and athletes. ""The CIAA has long had policies to encourage responsible behavior, and must consider what is necessary to assure days like today are not repeated, ever."" A message posted on the Virginia State University website read: ""VSU officials are fully cooperating with the CIAA in their investigation, and as a result, will not be able to comment any further.""","VSU football team ineligible for post-season play .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama is ready to talk even on Republicans' terms, he insisted Tuesday, so long as Congress acts first to end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling -- even for a short period. At a news conference, Obama indicated Republicans could essentially set the agenda for budget negotiations, but only if Congress agrees first to a short-term spending plan to fund the government and to raise the federal borrowing limit to avoid a possible first-ever U.S. default next week. ""I will talk about anything,"" the president said. House Speaker John Boehner, speaking Tuesday afternoon after what he called a ""pleasant"" but ineffectual phone call with Obama, promptly rejected the president's comments as nothing new. ""What the president said today was if there's unconditional surrender by Republicans, he'll sit down and talk to us,"" Boehner said. ""That's not the way our government works."" At the same time, Boehner said he's ""hopeful"" top Republicans and Democrats could soon begin a ""conversation."" ""There's going to be a negotiation here,"" the Ohio Republican said. ""We can't raise the debt ceiling without doing something about what's driving it to borrow more money and live beyond our means."" Yet while Boehner didn't indicate any points of agreement, a senior House Republican told CNN's Dana Bash that GOP members may be willing to go for a short-term debt ceiling hike -- lasting four to six weeks -- as long as the president agrees negotiations will occur during that time. Still, it's no guarantee such a measure would be supported by a majority of Republicans: something that Boehner has traditionally required before calling any vote in the House. A second GOP source says the White House drawing a line in the sand not to negotiate has further complicated matters. Republican leaders have talked, though, to CEOs who called them at the request of Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and senior presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett. And if there's no breakthrough? The partial government shutdown -- which began October 1, after the GOP-led House tied its funding measures to dismantling or defunding Obama's signature health care reform rather -- continues. Plus, another crisis looms October 17, when the Treasury Department says the U.S. government must raise the amount of money it can borrow or else be unable to pay its bills. All the partisan bickering -- and lack of progress -- is taking its toll not just on furloughed workers, shuttered government facilities and programs, but also Americans confidence in their government. Looking directly in the camera, Obama acknowledged frustrations with what's going in Washington -- in terms of the current impasse and all the other budgetary battles preceding it. ""We've got to stop repeating this pattern,"" the president said. ""I apologize you have to go through this stuff every three months, it seems like. And Lord knows, I'm tired of it. But at some point we've got to break these habits."" Boehner: Can't afford to keep spending without cuts . While the partial government shutdown is now in its second week, next week's deadline to raise the debt ceiling has many experts especially worried. Failure to act, they say, could lead to the government defaulting on its debt, spook Wall Street, spur higher interest rates and have other negative effects on the U.S. and global economy. ""If there was a problem lifting the debt ceiling, it could well be what is now a recovery would turn into a recession or even worse,"" said Olivier Blanchard, an International Monetary Fund economist. On Tuesday, Obama sternly warned that ""every American could see their 401(k)s and home values fall"" and the country would see a ""very significant risk"" of a deep recession. The only responsible action, he repeated: raise the debt ceiling, without preconditions. ""We're not going to pay ransom for"" America paying its bills, he told reporters, placing the blame squarely on House Republicans. ""Let's lift these threats from our families and our businesses and let's get down to work."" In his remarks Tuesday afternoon, Boehner didn't appear to give ground either. The president's refusal to talk -- until the government reopens and the debt ceiling is hiked -- is ""not sustainable,"" according to Boehner. ""The idea that we should continue to spend money that we don't have and give the bill to my kids and grandkids would be wrong,"" he said. Shutdown day 8: What you need to know . GOP-led House, Democratic-led Senate offer plans . Boehner and conservative Republicans want to leverage the situation to wring concessions on deficit reduction from Democrats. To keep up pressure, House Republicans voted Tuesday to set up negotiations on the debt limit and other fiscal issues. Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a GOP leader in the House, said such a negotiating committee with members of both parties could pass a short-term extension of the debt ceiling while doing its work. ""I suspect we can work out some mechanism to raise the debt ceiling while negotiations are under way,"" Cole said. ""But we're not going to simply raise it without talking about the deficit,"" Cole said. It was unclear if his description would satisfy Obama's insistence that the debt ceiling increase must be separate from political negotiations. Yet Senate Democrats have dismissed the proposal, and the Obama administration has vowed to veto any such. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York called these other GOP offers the latest in a series of ""new gimmicks"" that avoid the imminent need to fully reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling. In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid and Sen. Max Baucus filed a proposal Tuesday to raise the debt ceiling without addressing any deficit reduction issues demanded by Republicans. The plan would address the debt ceiling issue through December 31, 2014 -- past the next congressional elections. Most Republicans would shy away from a bill that doesn't specify spending cuts or other policy changes in return for the increased borrowing authority. Yet Democrats are hopeful some Republicans would vote across the aisle to prevent the potentially catastrophic economic repercussions of a default. If Senate Republicans require all the time-consuming steps available to them to delay action on the debt ceiling measure, a final vote might not take place until two days before the deadline for raising the borrowing limit, the Democratic aide said. Debt ceiling debate: Preaching to the choir . Shutdown furloughs about to hit nuclear safety agency . GOP to hold up back pay for furloughed workers . Debt ceiling 'like the smoke alarm' Such a Senate measure could increase pressure on the GOP-controlled House to do the same. Yet Republican House leaders have made clear they'll insist on concessions from Democrats before agreeing to raise the $16.7 trillion debt limit. ""The debt ceiling is there for a purpose. It's like the smoke alarm,"" said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas. ""Democrats want to unplug the smoke alarm, and Republicans want to go out and fight the fire."" Boehner has insisted a deal to raise the debt ceiling must include deficit reduction steps to lower costs of entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. However, he and fellow Republicans have moved away from the demand of the tea party conservative wing of his caucus targeting the president's signature Affordable Care Act passed by Democrats in 2010 and upheld by the Supreme Court last year. Rep. Tom Cole said, while any final deal must include repealing a tax on medical devices that's part of Obamacare, efforts otherwise to tie budget negotiations to the health care law appear dead. ""I think it's been overtaken by the debt ceiling,"" he said. Cruz: Use debt ceiling as leverage . Hagel: Most civilian Defense workers can return this week . On the shutdown, Obama and Democrats say the House would pass a Senate-approved spending plan to end it if Boehner allowed a vote. A CNN survey indicates that -- with 18 Republicans joining all 200 Democrats -- a slim majority in the House would support such a move. But Boehner won't allow such a vote, Cole said. ""He basically said we're going to have a negotiation,"" the Oklahoma Republican said. Poll: Most angry at both parties . While the two parties blame each other in Washington, outside the capital few get off easy. Shutdown forecast: Week two and clouds ahead . In a national poll released Monday, most respondents said the government shutdown was causing a crisis or major problems for the country. The CNN/ORC International survey indicated that slightly more people were angry at Republicans than Democrats or Obama for the shutdown, though both sides took a hit. According to the poll conducted over the weekend, 63% of respondents said they were angry at the Republicans for the way they have handled the shutdown, while 57% expressed anger at Democrats and 53% at Obama. ""It looks like there is more than enough blame to go around, and both parties are being hurt by the shutdown,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. Will 2014 election solve anything?

"(CNN) -- Defending champions Borussia Dortmund were held 4-4 in a frantic finish to their home match against VfB Stuttgart Friday. The Bundesliga leaders were denied a precious three points when visiting striker Christian Gentner scored the final equalizer in added time. It completed a topsy-turvy final last 15 minutes as the lead changed hands three times before the sides fittingly shared the points. But second placed Bayern Munich can now halve Dortmund's six-point lead with victory against Nuremberg Saturday. The top two are heading for a final showdown on Dortmund's home ground at Signal Iduna Park on April 11 which could well decide the destination of the German title. Dortmund, like Bayern on a superb run, looked to be cruising to a routine home win when their Japanese star Shinji Kagawa put them ahead with his fourth goal in three league games on 33 minutes. And when Jakub Blaszczykowski stretched their lead four minutes after the break from a pass by defender Mats Hummels it looked all over a victory for the men in yellow. But three goals in eight minutes by Stuttgart turned the game on its head. Bosnia striker Vedad Ibisevic cut the deficit with a 71st minute strike before Julian Schieber scored a quickfire double, the second a superb individual effort, to put the visitors 3-2 ahead. Dortmund drew level when defender Hummels cropped up to beat Stuttgart goalkeeper Sven Ulreich on 82 minutes and looked set to have settled the match when Croatia midfielder Ivan Perisic scored after coming off the substitute's bench. But deep into injury time and Gentner stunned the home fans with a dramatic late strike, which has opened the door for Bavarian giants Bayern. ""To concede the equalizer in the last few seconds was a bitter way to finish the game, Hummels told German television after the match.","Borussia Dortmund held to 4-4 home draw by VfB Stuttgart .

"(CNN) -- As a young boy, I loved watching the Atlanta Braves. I can recall countless historic moments over the course of their 47-year history in the city. It was in Atlanta that the Braves won an unprecedented 14 division championships from 1991 to 2005. It was in Atlanta that Hall of Famer Hank Aaron hit his record-breaking home run in 1974. It was in Atlanta that the Braves won a World Series championship in 1995. There is no doubt that the Braves belong to Atlanta. For 18 months, my administration has been involved in good-faith discussions to keep the Braves in downtown Atlanta as their lease at Turner Field nears expiration. On Monday, the Atlanta Braves organization announced its intention to relocate to Cobb County -- in a new stadium. Our partners in Cobb County will provide $450 million in public funding to build the new $672 million stadium, we're told. We are simply unwilling to match that with taxpayer dollars. On my inauguration into office in January 2010, I made a promise to strengthen our city's finances and tackle our looming $922 million infrastructure backlog. Over the last four years, we have balanced four consecutive budgets without property tax increases, built our cash reserves to more than $125 million and improved our bond ratings across the spectrum in every fund. Price too steep to keep Braves in city limits . Over the next four years, I am committed to making $200 million to $250 million in infrastructure investments in our neighborhoods. Professional sports teams and stadiums drive economic development and investment in their communities, but taxpayer dollars need to be spent responsibly. My decision not to invest $150 million to $250 million for renovations to Turner Field or interfere with a transaction when the Atlanta Braves are moving 12 miles away means that Atlanta is going to be stronger financially and not choked by debt. This decision also means critical investments in our city's infrastructure -- on bridges, green spaces, roads and traffic lights. For many years, the Falcons and the Braves have been fixtures in our city's downtown. There will be a new stadium for the Atlanta Falcons -- but there are meaningful differences between our efforts to keep the Falcons in the city and the Braves' decision to relocate to Cobb County. The agreement to keep the Falcons involved an existing revenue stream from a hotel-motel tax paid largely by the 42 million guests who visit our city every year -- lessening the burden to taxpayers. The hotel-motel tax, which would be extended only to fund and maintain the Falcons stadium, also generates significant direct revenue to the city's general fund. In the case of the Braves, no identifiable revenue stream exists that would allow us to pay for a commitment of $450 million or even $250 million responsibly. The Falcons stadium is expected to cost $1 billion, and that kind of transaction is tough. But we negotiated a favorable agreement for the city with 80% private funding and 20% public funding for the new facility. So we wish the Braves well knowing the city of Atlanta has much to be proud of. Over the last four years, business relocations have included the Coca-Cola Co.'s decision to move 2,000 jobs back into the city, Porsche Cars North America moving its North American headquarters into the city, and Pulte Homes relocating its corporate headquarters to Atlanta from Michigan. The city of Atlanta is vibrant and thriving, and we're just getting started. When the Braves leave the city of Atlanta in 2017, Turner Field will be demolished. Over the next three years, we will be working with our prospective partners to bring residential and business development that is worthy of our city and strengthens our downtown. The Braves will remain in the Atlanta metropolitan region, and I look forward to going to the opening day game in 2017. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kasim Reed.","Atlanta was hoping to keep the Braves downtown as Turner Field lease nears expiration .

"(CNN) -- Friday's French Open semifinal between Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, billed by some as the real final, lived up to the hype. Nadal, ultimately, was the happier man after an epic match that lasted more than four and a half hours on a sweltering day in Paris. The defending champion moved within a match of making it a record extending eight French Open titles by defeating the world No. 1 6-4 3-6 6-1 6-7 9-7. ""I was ready for the fight,"" Nadal told reporters. Nadal will now be the heavy favorite to beat fourth-seed David Ferrer in Sunday's all-Spanish final. Ferrer, who cruised past Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-1 7-6 (3) 6-2 in the other semifinal to dash local hopes, will be appearing in his maiden grand slam final and has lost 16 consecutive matches on clay against Nadal. Nadal, in his 35th meeting against Djokovic, improved to 5-0 against the Serb at the French Open. But for a while it appeared as if Djokovic would inflict more woe on Nadal in a gripping rematch of last year's final. Djokovic had topped Nadal in three straight grand slam finals beginning in 2011, downing him in six hours in the 2012 Australian Open finale. Djokovic led 4-2 in the fifth set -- after Nadal blew a break lead in the second and couldn't serve out the match in the fourth. It was just the second time Nadal has been taken to five sets at Roland Garros. ""When I was serving for the match it was against the wind so I knew that it would be a tough game,"" Nadal said. ""It was a similar match to the one in Australia in 2012 and he won. This time it is me that won and that is what makes sport so big."" The thriller wasn't without controversy. With Djokovic leading 4-3 in the fifth and at deuce, he put away a simple smash. Chair umpire Pascal Maria, however, ruled that he touched the net before the ball bounced twice -- giving Nadal the point. Djokovic won the next point to revert to deuce -- instead of holding for 5-3 -- and Nadal eventually broke for 4-4. ""Who knows what direction the match may have taken if I had won that point,"" Djokovic told reporters. ""On 99.9 per cent of other occasions, I would have got the point."" Maria earlier gave both players a warning for taking too much time between points. Djokovic was also upset that his request to water the court in the fifth set was denied. He felt the court was too dry. ""I was not asking to water the court because I want to make my opponent trip or do something like that,"" Djokovic said. ""I was doing it for myself, because I felt that it got very dry and it was very slippery."" Nadal made the better start, gradually taking control of the first set in the hot conditions thought to suit him -- his heavy ground strokes move through the court quicker and his balls bounce higher. With Djokovic spraying shots and Nadal hitting deep, the Spaniard broke for 4-3. He saw off Djokovic in the opener and seemed headed for a win when he broke again for 3-2 in the second. Not for the first time in the encounter, Nadal would drop his serve in the ensuing game. A rattled Nadal lost four games in succession and the match was level. Nadal stormed to the third set and again held the lead in the fourth. He broke for 4-3, only to drop serve for 4-4. Unusually for Nadal, he couldn't close out the match when trying to serve it out at 6-5. As Nadal hit shorter, Djokovic was allowed to step in and crush his ground strokes. A reeling Nadal was broken to start the fifth but rallied, aided by Djokovic erring on several overheads. ""It's a very special win for me and congratulations to Novak,"" Nadal said. ""He's a great champion and he is going to win here at Roland Garros one day."" Ferrer capitalized on apparent nerves from Tsonga in the first set and overturned a 3-0 deficit in the second. Once Ferrer took the second set, Tsonga sagged. Tsonga was bidding to become the first Frenchman in 30 years to win a major.","Rafael Nadal rallies from a break down in the fifth set to beat Novak Djokovic .

"(CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron has given Sri Lanka a March 2014 deadline to hold an independent international inquiry into alleged war crimes during the country's 26-year civil war. Cameron held talks with Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa while in the capital of Colombo for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting on Friday. The summit opened Friday amid concerns about the rights situation after Sri Lanka's war with the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which ended in 2009. The prime ministers of Canada, Mauritius and India opted not to attend. On Saturday, Cameron acknowledged that Sri Lanka had suffered ""almost three decades of bloody conflict"" and that recovery and reconciliation took time. He said he made it clear to Rajapaksa that he had ""a real opportunity, through magnanimity and reform, to build a successful, inclusive and prosperous future for his country."" Among the steps needed to achieve this were ""credible, transparent and independent investigations into alleged war crimes,"" Cameron said. ""And let me be very clear. If that investigation is not completed by March, then I will use our position on the U.N. Human Rights Council to work with the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner and call for a full, credible and independent international inquiry."" Cameron said his meeting with the president was ""very frank"" and ""nothing was off the agenda."" Read more: Cameron mobbed by protesters in Sri Lanka . A statement issued by Rajapaksa's office earlier Saturday, noted that Cameron had raised concerns ""relating to displaced persons, land issues, military presence in the Province and devolving powers to the newly elected Council."" ""President Rajapaksa, in response, explained that an enormous amount of work has been done in terms of resettlement, rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure destroyed during the conflict. In order to reach consensus on political matters a Parliamentary Special Committee (PSC) has been established for all parties concerned to air their views and reach a settlement,"" it said. Read more: Sri Lankan diplomat says rights criticism 'proxy propaganda war' The statement said Rajapaksa had observed that the PSC was the best forum for the purpose, stating: ""As it is now only four years since the end of the conflict the country needs some more time to overcome all major challenges."" In an interview that aired Thursday on CNN's ""Amanpour,"" Sri Lanka's high commissioner to the United Kingdom, Chris Nonis, also denied that an independent international inquiry was needed. ""We respect the independence and sovereignty of your country, and we expect you to respect ours. We don't need an international investigation when we have had a vibrant civilization for 2,500 years. We have perfectly educated people, and I think we're perfectly capable of carrying out our own domestic inquiry,"" he told CNN's Frederik Pleitgen. Nonis pointed to the 2011 ""Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission"" report, which Rajapaksa ordered. ""It's a very holistic, very comprehensive, very impartial report. It had over 5,000 hearings, and it's set within the principle of international humanitarian law, incorporating the principle of distinction and the principle of proportionality."" Independent judiciary? As many as 70,000 people were killed in Sri Lanka's war. In its final stage, which lasted from September 2008 to May 2009, the Sri Lankan army advanced into an area of the north where about 330,000 people were trapped by fighting. A U.N. report in 2011 said the government used ""large-scale and widespread shelling"" that left a large number of civilians dead. The number of civilian deaths and injuries are unknown to this day, and U.N. figures greatly differ from those in reports from Sri Lanka's government and various nongovernmental organizations. The International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute on Friday questioned whether Sri Lanka's legal system was capable of responding to human rights violations, saying that required an independent judiciary. ""Since the end of the armed conflict, the Sri Lankan government has been systematically dismantling checks and balances on independent justice institutions,"" co-chair Helena Kennedy said in a statement. ""The IBAHRI considers that the lack of an independent judiciary will prevent the Sri Lankan legal system from providing an effective investigation into war crimes and human rights violations committed by government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam at the end of the armed conflict in 2009."" The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 53 nations that initially formed out of what had been the British Empire. Its charter focuses on developing ""free and democratic societies and the promotion of peace and prosperity to improve the lives of all peoples of the Commonwealth.""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama indicated a willingness Wednesday to agree to a short-term deal to raise the federal borrowing limit, if Republicans will accept it, a Democratic lawmaker told CNN. The president signaled more ""give"" to the idea of a six-week deal to hike the debt ceiling during a private White House meeting with House Democrats, said the lawmaker, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The revelation comes amid a stalemate that has Republicans trying to use spending and debt limit deadlines as leverage to wring concessions from Obama and Democrats. The result of the political standoff has been a partial government shutdown that is in its second week and fears of a possible U.S. default on its debt that economists warn could cause another recession. CNN has been reporting that senior House GOP sources are signaling openness to the idea of a short-term increase in the debt ceiling, as long as Democrats agree to negotiations on how to reduce the debt and deficit during the time the debt ceiling is increased. Talking about a short-term solution, Obama told the group ""if that's what (House Speaker John) Boehner needs to climb out of the tree that he's stuck in, then that's something we should look at,"" according to the lawmaker, who attended the meeting. 'Measure of hope' The lawmaker left the White House meeting with a ""small measure of hope that this becomes an exit strategy."" The president warned if Republicans want to propose a short-term fix and Democrats say no, then the firm ground Democrats think they're standing on now would soften. Boehner and Republicans are demanding that Obama and Senate Democrats negotiate on deficit reduction steps that would be part of legislation to reopen the government and raise the limit on federal borrowing needed to pay the bills. Obama has refused to enter formal talks until the shutdown ends and the debt ceiling has been raised to remove the threat of default. A senior House Republican told CNN that GOP members may be willing to go for a short-term debt ceiling hike -- lasting four to six weeks -- as long as the president agrees that negotiations will occur during that time. However, no specifics were immediately available about how such legislation would take shape or how the talks would occur. But Republican sources have also told CNN the parameters of those talks have to be specific enough to sell to their skeptical GOP members. So what would Democrats be willing to talk about? The lawmaker said House Democrats are open to hearing what Republicans have in mind with a short-term deal. GOP seeks leverage . The shutdown began when Congress failed to pass a spending plan for the new fiscal year that started October 1. Now another deadline looms -- the need to increase the federal borrowing limit by October 17 or risk a U.S. default. Days of back-and-forth rhetoric and jibes between the leaders have brought no direct negotiations, but plenty of accusations and political spin. On Wednesday, GOP leaders appeared to shift their focus from efforts to dismantle Obama's signature health care reform, the initial driving force behind the shutdown, to securing spending cuts elsewhere. Boehner, who earlier this year told his GOP colleagues that he was finished negotiating one on one with the president, has called for Obama to sit down for what he calls a ""conversation"" on how to reopen the government and prevent what would be the first-ever U.S. default as soon as next week. But when Obama invited the entire House Republican caucus to the White House as part of a series of meetings with legislators, Boehner's office responded that only the GOP leadership and committee chairmen would attend the Thursday gathering. ""It is our hope that this will be a constructive meeting and that the president finally recognizes Americans expect their leaders to be able to sit down and resolve their differences,"" said a statement by a Boehner aide. Obama's invitation was intended to demonstrate outreach to Republicans just eight days from when the Treasury says Congress must increase the federal debt ceiling or risk default. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama was disappointed that Boehner was limiting attendance at Thursday's meeting to fewer than 20 of the more than 200 House Republicans. ""The president thought it was important to talk directly with the members who forced this economic crisis on the country"" about the potential harmful impacts from the shutdown and a possible default, Carney said in a statement, repeating that Obama ""will not pay the Republicans ransom for doing their job."" Meanwhile, GOP leaders were distancing themselves from demands by tea party conservatives to also make dismantling Obamacare a condition for agreement. Ryan's plan drops Obamacare . Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman who was the party's vice presidential nominee last year, argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that Democrats and Republicans should focus on ""modest reforms to entitlement programs and the tax code."" ""Right now, we need to find common ground,"" Ryan wrote in the column posted online Tuesday night. ""We need to open the federal government. We need to pay our bills today -- and make sure we can pay our bills tomorrow. So let's negotiate an agreement to make modest reforms to entitlement programs and the tax code."" However, Ryan's column never mentioned Obamacare, focusing instead on forced spending cuts to domestic and military programs, as well as reforms to Medicare. Ryan's Obamacare omission appeared to anger conservatives, who took to Twitter in response. ""Much like White House press, Paul Ryan doesn't mention Obamacare in WSJ oped,"" tweeted Dan Holler, spokesman for the conservative group Heritage Action. Perhaps in response to a conservative backlash, Boehner made a brief statement Wednesday on the House floor that focused on the GOP message that Obamacare was detrimental to the country. He stopped short of linking it to any negotiations on ending the shutdown and raising the debt ceiling. Boehner insists that the government must reduce deficits, declaring that Republicans won't raise the debt ceiling without steps toward that goal. Boehner demands cuts for debt limit increase . But a House GOP leadership source told CNN on Wednesday that Obama's rejection of linking negotiations to raising the borrowing limit meant Republicans would likely be forced to agree to a ""clean"" debt ceiling limit proposal in exchange for setting up talks on deficit reduction steps. According to the source, the economic implications of a U.S. default ""scares people"" to make such a deal acceptable to enough House Republicans in order to get negotiations started. The source acknowledged Boehner may lack support from some or most of his GOP caucus, requiring Democratic votes for the proposal to pass. Democrats planning . Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois told CNN his side already was mulling over ""what we will discuss, what we will negotiate over, what things will be on the table."" Obama also met with the House Democratic caucus at the White House. The GOP-led House passed a measure on Tuesday to set up a special negotiating team comprising members of both parties from the House and Senate, but Obama and Democrats rejected the concept as the latest Republican gimmick to force talks before raising the debt ceiling. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats announced they will propose a measure to increase the debt ceiling beyond next year's congressional elections with no additional issues attached. While many Republicans are certain to oppose it, Democratic leaders hope increased pressure for Congress to prevent a default next week will cause some GOP senators to vote for it. A GOP source told CNN on Tuesday that the White House was having corporate chief executives call Republican leaders. The business community has called for resolving the Washington stalemate to avoid a default that would spike interest rates to impact the economy. Without a breakthrough, the shutdown would continue at a cost estimated at up to $50 billion a month. Failure to raise the debt ceiling by next week's deadline would leave the government unable to borrow money to pay its bills for the first time in its history. All the partisan bickering -- and lack of progress -- is taking its toll not just on furloughed workers, shuttered government facilities and programs, but also on Americans' confidence in their government. Poll: Most angry at both parties . Shutdown forecast: Week two and clouds ahead . In a national poll released Monday, most respondents said the government shutdown was causing a crisis or major problems for the country. The CNN/ORC International survey indicated that slightly more people were angry at Republicans than Democrats or Obama for the shutdown, though both sides took a hit. According to the poll conducted over the weekend, 63% of respondents said they were angry at the Republicans for the way they have handled the shutdown, while 57% expressed anger at Democrats and 53% at Obama. ""It looks like there is more than enough blame to go around, and both parties are being hurt by the shutdown,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. According to a new Gallup poll Wednesday, the Republican party's favorable rating dropped to 28%, down 10 percentage points from September. The 43% for Democrats was a 4-percentage-point drop from last month. Will 2014 election solve anything? Senate Democrats sought to keep up the pressure, holding a rally on the Capitol steps on Wednesday to demonstrate their unified stance in calling for House Republicans to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling. A CNN survey indicates enough Republicans in the House would join Democrats in voting for a Senate-passed spending plan to end the shutdown. All 200 Democrats and 19 Republicans support passing a continuing resolution with no additional legislative strings attached . With two vacancies in 435-member House, 217 votes are currently the minimum needed for the measure to win approval in the House. However, not enough Republicans are willing to join Democrats in a procedural move to force Boehner to hold a vote on the Senate plan. Boehner has said the measure would fail to pass in the House, a contention rejected by Obama and Democrats. The speaker has previously allowed measures to pass the House with mostly Democratic support, which has weakened his leadership among conservatives. Doing so now could cost him his leadership post due to the conservative backlash in would likely unleash, analysts believe. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Paul Steinhauser, Jim Acosta, Deirdre Walsh, Barbara Starr, Ted Barrett, Dan Merica and Brianna Keilar contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama indicates a willingness to accept a short-term deal, a lawmaker says .

"(CNN) -- Taylor Farms has recalled more than 5,000 pounds of broccoli salad kit products because of possible Listeria contamination, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. The kits were shipped to distributors and delis for consumer purchase in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. They contain dressing in packets that are the subject of a Food and Drug Administration recall. Last week, Listeria concerns prompted Reser's Fine Foods to recall some 109,000 cases of refrigerated ready-to-eat products. Taylor Farms informed the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service that kits contained salad dressing subject to that recall. There have been no reports of illnesses. Recalled products include boxes labeled ""TAYLOR FARMS BROCCOLI CRUNCH WITH BACON AND DRESSING,"" with the case codes 310151 or 310153, the USDA said in a statement. The products were produced on October 21, 22 and 23. They bear the establishment number EST. 34522 inside the USDA mark of inspection. The bacterium Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection. Listeriosis typically affects older adults, pregnant women, infants and adults with compromised immune systems. Symptoms include fever and muscle aches, and sometimes diarrhea or other gastrointestinal problems. Other symptoms can include headache, confusion and convulsions. It can be treated with antibiotics.","Taylor Farms recalls more than 5,000 pounds of broccoli salad kit products .

"(CNN) -- The enduring symbol of the government shutdown was when World War II veterans stormed the barricades on the National Mall. They reminded those of us in public service that they fought and died so we could resolve our differences peacefully. Nowhere on our monuments will you read the words: ""I will not negotiate."" In fact, our monuments tell the opposite story. Our National Mall is a monument to compromise and sacrificial leadership. As the debate about how to end the government shutdown converges with a debate over the nation's borrowing limit, the real decision Washington faces is whether to make hard choices now or later. We don't need short-term extensions as much as we need a long-term spending addiction recovery plan. We are out of control. Congress should do what any responsible parent would do if their adolescent child couldn't handle the responsibility of a credit card. We should cut up the credit card and live within our means. If we do nothing, sooner or later we'll see the White House's worst fears realized -- a sudden interest rate spike, a collapse of our credit rating and a global economic meltdown. People of good faith on both sides agree on the math. There is no way we can grow fast enough to avoid massive -- and debilitating -- tax increases or structural changes to our entitlement programs. My friend Erskine Bowles, who served as chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, put it best when he said we face the ""most predictable economic crisis in history."" So when Treasury Secretary Jack Lew says failing to lift the debt ceiling would be playing with fire, he's the one on the wrong side of economics and history. The real danger is not solving the underlying problem of overspending that requires us to raise the debt ceiling. As Moody's Credit Agency has explained, not raising the debt limit will not cause a default and will leave our ""creditworthiness intact."" Regardless, we can, and should, act now to avoid further crisis in the future. The good news is we have plenty of options. The president's own budget is a good place to start. In it he proposed $435 billion in savings over the next decade that many Republicans would accept. Why would he not work with us to enact those savings? Specifically, the president proposed using a more accurate way to adjust for inflation with Social Security benefits and other federal payments. His proposal could save $230 billion over 10 years. Why should this idea be off limits? The president also proposed saving $50 billion over the next decade by asking wealthy seniors to pay a little more for their Medicare premiums. I introduced a bill with Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill building on this policy. Why should our bipartisan bill inspired by the president be off the table? This week I released a report with Democratic Sens. Carl Levin and Tom Carper and Republican Sen. John McCain. Featured on ""60 Minutes,"" it exposed a ""disability industrial complex"" that is riddled with fraud. The Social Security Disability Trust Fund will be bankrupt by 2016. Millions of disabled Americans will face benefit cuts or middle-income Americans will face an increase in their payroll taxes. Why should we raise the debt ceiling without working to cut the billions in waste and fraud that has been uncovered in our bipartisan investigations? Meanwhile, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office has detailed $250 billion in duplication in our discretionary budget that both parties have largely ignored. Why would we impose billions of dollars of additional debt on future generations when we could instead find billions in additional savings? I'm pleased my colleagues in the House are making similar and additional proposals of their own. The fact is the menu of options from numerous commissions and proposals amounts to trillions in savings. What we need is the political courage to act. The real question is: If now is not the time to negotiate, then when? Delaying these decisions might be good for our political security, but it will seriously undermine our economic and national security. Our founders understood that politicians and factions would always be tempted to not compromise, and would try to ideologically cleanse the public square of meaningful opposition. This hyperpartisan mentality was on display with both the passage of Obamacare and the counterproductive backlash in my own party. The result has been a government shutdown. As someone with a record of cutting spending and holding popular -- but costly -- bills, I'm not afraid to say that principled compromise is courageous, and neither should anyone in public office. I believe the very compromises that gave us our nation can be used to save our nation. As much as I would love to see 67 pure conservatives in the Senate, that isn't going to happen. And as much as I would love to cut spending by $9 trillion, as I detailed in my own ""Back in Black"" plan, I'll settle for less if we can save America in the process. At pivotal moments, our best leaders have always chosen negotiation and compromise over domination and humiliation. George Washington could have been king but he gave up power. Abraham Lincoln chose reconstruction over retribution. Harry Truman gave our vanquished foes a new beginning with the Marshall Plan, and he even let Japan keep its emperor, and with it secured the peace. It's time for President Obama, and all our congressional leaders, to do the same. All our problems can be solved, but only if we participate. The time to do so is now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tom Coburn.","Tom Coburn: We need a long-term deal, not short-term extensions in shutdown crisis .

"(CNN) -- The United States denounced the early morning twin bombings at an Egyptian security forces building that killed 16 people and wounded more than 100 in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura. In its statement on Tuesday, the U.S. State Department expressed hopes for a quick recovery for those injured in the two blasts, which occurred in quick succession about 1 a.m. local time Tuesday. State news agency MENA confirmed the casualty toll. ""The United States stands firmly with the Egyptian people as they work to put their country on the path towards democracy, stability, and economic prosperity, in an atmosphere free from violence,"" the State Department message said. Interim Prime Minister Hazem al Beblawi called the attack a terrorist incident and said the perpetrators will not go unpunished. Ansar Jerusalem, a jihadist group responsible for attacks in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, claimed responsibility for the act. But al Beblawi singled out the Muslim Brotherhood, without directly blaming the organization for the attack, and called it a terrorist group in a statement to the nation, the state news agency MENA reported. Among the people injured is the head of the security directorate of Dakahlia governorate, MENA said, citing Health Ministry officials. Part of the building collapsed after the explosion, the news agency said. One blast occurred on one of the top floors of the building and was quickly followed by a car bomb, MENA reported. Brotherhood labeled a terror group . Egypt's Cabinet declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group and a terrorist organization, Hossam Issa, deputy prime minister and minister of higher education, announced in a statement on Egypt's state TV on Wednesday. Issa blamed the Brotherhood for the bombing, saying that ""all of Egypt was horrified by the ugly crime."" Egypt's Cabinet also decided to place penalties on those who joined the group or remained a member. A 'strong' condemnation from Brotherhood . The Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party ""strongly condemned"" the bombing, the group said on its website. It expressed surprise at al Beblawi's contentions. ""Coup authorities realized that fraud will not work (in the coming referendum on a new constitution). So, they resorted to this heinous bombing,"" Hamza Zawbaa, FJP media spokesman, said. ""All violence is reprehensible. God, as well as the whole world, bear witness that the Brotherhood is innocent of all that."" Witness: Heavy damage at the site . Ahmed El Shabrawy was at his home when he heard a loud blast. He told CNN it took him five minutes to run to the building, where he saw a man pulled from the rubble by bystanders. He estimated that dozens of cars were damaged, and there was a large area around one of the blast sites where there was ""heavy material damage."" At least 10 ambulances had responded to the scene, he said. So many people rushed to a blood donation center that workers had to turn people away, he added. CNN first learned of the blasts from Twitter. Upcoming vote on proposed constitution . The blasts come in the lead-up to Egypt's referendum on a new constitution, which will be held January 14-15. The draft constitution would ban religious parties and put more power in the hands of the military. A military coup in July unseated President Mohamed Morsy, who was democratically elected. Since then there have been almost daily protests, some of which have ended in violence and other bombings, such as one on December 12 when 20 police recruits were injured in a car bomb attack. On Sunday, Ansar Jerusalem issued an online statement calling on army and police members to quit. ""With your staying in these institutions from evening to morning, you are incurring the anger of Allah,"" the statement said. Morsy, an Islamist leader, has endured a series of legal troubles. He and 132 others will face trial for escaping from prison in 2011, state media reported Saturday. Morsy will be tried along with members of the Muslim Brotherhood and Palestinian Hamas, the al Ahram state newspaper reported. He is also charged with raiding other prisons, and killing soldiers and officers in Rafah, it said. He has been in custody since his ouster. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","Cabinet declares Muslim Brotherhood a terror group .

"(CNN) -- A second Massachusetts compounding pharmacy surrendered its license after state inspectors found ""significant"" issues that could affect sterility, state health officials said. The pharmacy, Infusion Resource, was also found to have a center for giving intravenous medications to patients in violation of state regulations, which require a clinic license, Dr. Madeleine Biondolillo, director of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health Bureau of Healthcare Safety and Quality, said Sunday. The state Board of Pharmacy immediately issued a cease and desist notice to Infusion Resource after the October 23 inspection revealed the violations, she said. Over the weekend, the Department of Public Health ""secured the voluntary surrender of Infusion's pharmacy license."" The company, which compounds antibiotic and nutritional IV medications for home use, said in a statement it has since recalled all compounded products dispensed in the past month, effecting 38 patients. ""No issues were cited related to the integrity of our products nor to the quality of our compounding practices,"" said Bernard Lambrese, Infusion Resource CEO, in a statement. ""It is correct that Infusion Resource does not have a clinic license from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The space in our facility is intended for patient education, validation of patient and caregiver skills, medication counseling, medication education, teaching and training."" What is a compounding pharmacy? Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said last week the state would immediately begin unannounced inspections of all Massachusetts pharmacies and require that they submit annual reports detailing what they produce and distribute. That announcement came in the wake of the fungal meningitis outbreak that has caused 25 deaths and 354 illnesses, linked to the Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center. Seven of those illnesses are peripheral joint infections that specifically affect a joint such as a knee, hip, shoulder or elbow. Infusion Resource is not linked to the outbreak. The incident began unfolding September 24, when the department was notified about a cluster of six rare fungal meningitis cases in Tennessee.

"(CNN) -- Oh, the weather outside is %#!$. That's the tune many travelers may be singing this weekend as powerful storms threaten to bring severe thunderstorms and icy conditions to vast parts of the country, just in time for holiday travel. Flight delays could be possible Saturday in Oklahoma City, Wichita and Kansas City, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Tulsa International Airport in Oklahoma could be forced to close Saturday because of severe icing, he said. On Sunday, delays are possible in many key air travel hubs and larger markets, including Chicago, Milwaukee, Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Charlotte and Atlanta, Morris predicted. The weird weather comes just as the Christmas holiday travel period is set to get started. About 94.5 million Americans are expected to travel at least 50 miles from home during the holiday beginning Saturday, according to AAA. ""I see problems, and definitely no shortage of them,"" CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons said Friday. Of greatest concern: a moderate risk of severe thunderstorms that could produce isolated tornadoes in the lower Mississippi Valley, and the threat of icy conditions in the Midwest and Northeast. While icy conditions were being reported in Kansas, the problems began to spread Friday night, as a front fueled by moisture from the Gulf of Mexico swept across the Lower Mississippi Valley. Up to 5 inches of rain was expected across a broad area from northeast Texas to eastern New York. Late Friday, the National Weather Service was reporting that heavy rain was possible from the Lower Mississippi Valley to northern New England. It predicted a band of snow from the Central Plains to the Great Lakes and into some of northern Maine. Freezing rain was possible from the southern Plains to the Great Lakes and New England. Though it had said there only a ""slight risk"" of severe thunderstorms over parts of the western Gulf Coast and the Lower Mississippi Valley, the service reported Friday evening sighting a tornado near the community of Newman, Mississippi, about 25 miles west of Jackson. An almost stationary front that extended from the Southern High Plains to New England was expected to drop sometimes heavy rains by Sunday over parts of that swath. And a band of freezing rain/sleet was predicted from Oklahoma across parts of the Great Lakes into New England. Ice-storm warnings were in effect for most of Oklahoma through Sunday morning, with thunderstorms and freezing rain possible Friday night, according to CNN's Morris. As much as an inch of ice was expected to coat all exposed surfaces, he said, with at least half an inch of ice possible in Oklahoma City and Tulsa. Widespread power outages were predicted Sunday. Heavy rains were expected over much of the Ohio River Valley and mid-Mississippi River Valley on Sunday, leading to flooding next week of low-lying farmland along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and residential areas located along rivers, creeks and streams. Severe storms are possible on Sunday, when a cold front is predicted to move across the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. The messiness had already begun Friday, when ice on roads and sidewalks in Iowa was blamed for numerous crashes and falls. And morning icing in Topeka, Kansas, caused several wrecks, CNN affiliate KSNT reported. Meanwhile, temperatures will continue to rise in the East ahead of the cold front trailing the storms, with New York reaching an unseasonable 67 degrees Sunday and Washington warming to 72 degrees.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Casualties from Wednesday's wave of attacks across Iraq rose to 93 people dead and 312 wounded, the Interior Ministry said Thursday, making it the deadliest day in the country since the United States withdrew its troops in December. The attacks were mostly aimed at Shiite pilgrims trekking and driving to a shrine in Baghdad. The scale of violence left some stunned. ""I am deeply shocked and utterly dismayed by the despicable attacks across Iraq today that have claimed the lives of scores of Iraqis, including many pilgrims, and have injured dozens more,"" Martin Kobler, the U.N. secretary-general's special representative for Iraq, said Wednesday. ""The scale of the violence is disturbing. I urgently appeal to the government to address the root causes of the violence and terrorism that are causing so much suffering and pain to the Iraqi people."" The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad said the attacks ""killed and wounded innocent men, women, and children of all religious and ethnic backgrounds."" ""The perpetrators of these cowardly terrorist attacks must be brought to justice and we will support Iraq's Security Forces in this effort in any way we can."" Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki met with Tony Blinken, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's national security adviser, in Baghdad on Thursday. The two men discussed U.S.-Iraqi relations, but it is unclear whether they talked about the attacks. En route from across the country, including the Shiite heartland of southern Iraq, pilgrims have been headed to the Imam Kadhim shrine in the Kadhimiya neighborhood of Baghdad. The event culminates Saturday when the faithful commemorate the death of Imam Moussa al-Kadhim, one of 12 revered imams in Shiite Islam. The violence sparks fears of a renewal of the fighting between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq in the last decade, a longtime animosity intensified by the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the toppling of the Saddam Hussein regime. Most people in Iraq are Shiites, but under Hussein, Sunnis held a great deal of power despite their minority status. Shiites gained the upper hand politically after Hussein was overthrown by a U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Sunnis felt disenfranchised amid that political backdrop, and many backed insurgent actions against the government. As a result, Sunni-Shiite violence exploded in the 2000s. The violence eventually ebbed as the war wound down, but ever since, there have been spurts of high-profile attacks. One of the deadliest days recently came on January 5 when at least 60 people were killed in attacks that again targeted Shiites on a pilgrimage. But Wednesday's violence eclipses that day and is reminiscent of last decade's sectarian strife. More than 100 people died in three separate actions as recently as 2009. A string of suicide bombs in December of 2009 left 127 people dead. And two car bombs outside Baghdad's province building and the Justice Ministry in October of that year killed 160 people. In August, two truck bombings and three other blasts left at least 100 people dead. Al Qaeda's umbrella group in Iraq, a Sunni group that has targeted Shiites, claimed responsibility for those attacks.

"Mexico City (CNN) -- The runner-up in Mexico's presidential election said Friday he still won't accept a vote count, even after the country's electoral tribunal upheld the legality of the election and officially declared Enrique Pena Nieto as the winner. Leftist candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has not conceded the July 1 election, citing allegations of electoral fraud by the victorious Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI. The electoral tribunal on Thursday rejected a demand by Lopez Obrador's coalition, the Progressive Movement of Mexico, to invalidate the presidential election, which he lost by 6 percentage points. On Friday, it validated the final results, officially naming Pena Nieto as president-elect. ""The elections were not clean or free or authentic. As such, I will not recognize the illegitimate power that came from vote-buying and other grave violations of the constitution and the laws,"" Lopez Obrador said. The candidate called on his followers to demonstrate in Mexico City's historical square, the Zocalo, on September 9. Lopez Obrador narrowly lost another presidential race in 2006. Back then, he refused to recognize the new government and called his supporters into the streets. He went on a national tour, where he drummed up support, calling himself the ""legitimate president of Mexico."" It was unclear if he would call for similar demonstrations now. In a unanimous decision announced Thursday, the electoral tribunal ruled that the demand to invalidate the election was ""unfounded."" The tribunal found that the leftist coalition that brought the charges didn't prove any constitutional violations and didn't show that the process wasn't free and fair. Critics of the process said the irregularities included illegal campaign spending, secretive financing and coercion of voters. Read more: Vote-buying allegations persist after Mexican election . When the allegations surfaced immediately after the vote, election officials recounted the votes in more than half of the ballot boxes individually. Among the bigger controversies were allegations that PRI campaigners passed out hundreds of supermarket gift cards in exchange for votes.

"(CNN) -- ""Down the shore, everything's all right,"" President Barack Obama declared Tuesday on his return to New Jersey's devastated coast seven months after Superstorm Sandy caused billions of dollars in damage there. The line from the Tom Waits song ""Jersey Girl,"" popularized by local hero Bruce Springsteen, was the main theme of the joint visit by Obama and Gov. Chris Christie to survey recovery efforts and encourage people to hit the beaches this summer. Christie, a Republican, was criticized last year for appearing with Obama after the devastating storm at the height of the 2012 election campaign and praising the Democratic president's response. Obama subsequently won re-election while Christie saw his poll numbers soar. Tuesday's return visit by the pair raised anew the perception that both sought to again gain political benefit from jointly touring the disaster-stricken region. In introducing the president for remarks in drizzly Asbury Park, Christie rejected any political machinations behind efforts to generate federal help for his state. ""New Jersey is more important, our citizens' lives are more important than any type of politics at all,"" said the governor, who is up for re-election this year and is considered a potential GOP presidential contender in 2016. Obama pledged that his administration will continue to support New Jersey's recovery, reminding the crowd of his promise seven months ago that ""your country would have your back."" Obama's cuddle bear from Jersey (no, not Christie) ""I meant it,"" he said to applause. Both Obama and Christie emphasized that Asbury Park, made famous by Springsteen's roots there, and the rest of the Jersey Shore was open for business. ""After all you've dealt with, after all you've been through, the Jersey Shore is back,"" the president said to cheers, adding that residents ""want all Americans to know that they are ready to welcome you here."" To drive home the point, Obama and Christie visited the Point Pleasant boardwalk and even engaged in a ""Touchdown Fever"" football toss, with Obama missing his throws while Christie's first effort was a winner, sailing through the tire. ""One and done,"" the governor exclaimed, while Obama gave Christie a high-five and quipped: ""That's because he's running for office."" A man behind the counter handed Obama a stuffed teddy bear with a Chicago-themed shirt. Superstorm Sandy forced both Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney to suspend campaign activities for a few days in the final run-up to last November's election. Christie, a top Romney surrogate who delivered the keynote address at the Republican National Convention, joined Obama for a tour of the storm damage and made a point of praising the president for his ""personal concern and compassion"" for the state and its people. The bipartisan display benefited both men, according to polls, and was considered a boost to Obama's re-election effort in the final days of the campaign. Christie meets Snooki . In the storm, hundreds of thousands of homes and oceanfront businesses were either damaged or destroyed. Businesses on the Jersey Shore are still working to recover at the beginning of the busy summer tourist season, which in years past has brought billions of dollars in revenue to the state. Tuesday's trip was the second in three days by Obama to the site of a natural disaster following two weeks of controversies involving his administration, including the disclosure of IRS targeting of conservative groups and a secret subpoena for journalists' phone records. Obama toured tornado-inflicted damage in Moore, Oklahoma, on Sunday and encouraged further congressional support for programs that bolster emergency management systems for municipalities. The president praised the Federal Emergency Management Agency for its quick response to the Moore tornado, just as he did last fall when Sandy struck the East Coast. Since coming under heavy criticism for missteps in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, FEMA has been commended by localities for responding quickly to disasters and reducing bureaucratic hurdles.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Key measures of President-elect Barack Obama's economic recovery plan are facing a barrage of criticism from some Senate Democrats, with one charging that the plan's tax breaks were a return to ""trickledown"" economics. Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, says many of the tax credits in the stimulus plan amount to ""trickledown"" economics. During a lengthy closed-door meeting Thursday evening with Democratic senators on Capitol Hill, Larry Summers, chosen to head the National Economic Council, and senior Obama adviser David Axelrod heard complaints about the stimulus plan, according to two senior Democratic aides who attended the meeting. ""The concern seemed to be that people feel like the infrastructure projects are certain to create jobs and the business tax breaks are less certain to create jobs, and that's what our focus needs to be,"" one of the aides said. Democrats also appealed to the Obama team to figure out a way to ensure that money for roads and bridges filters down to cities, counties and local planning boards. The aide said some members are ""fearful that governors will have all the say."" Wisconsin Democrat Ron Kind, a member of the House tax writing committee, described the meeting as a discussion on a variety of proposals. ""I don't think anyone really expects this stuff is going to come down from some mountain written on tablets and given to the Congress. But certainly, there's going to be a lot of deference toward what the administration is thinking, but there are areas that can be tweaked and improved upon,"" Kind said. Democrats made it clear that they plan to put their stamp on the massive economic stimulus bill. New York Democrat Charlie Rangel, who chairs the tax panel, said negotiations are continuing about which specific tax proposals will remain in the package. Obama wants a bill on his desk by mid-February, putting negotiations on a fast track. The Obama team will return Sunday for another session with Senate Democrats. Summers held back-to-back meetings Friday, first with the full House Democratic caucus and then with the Democratic members of the Ways and Means committee, which is drafting the tax cut part of the plan. On Thursday, key members of Obama's party emerged from a closed-door meeting of the Senate Finance Committee criticizing central tax measures of the president-elect's proposals.  Watch Obama explain his tax proposals » . In particular, members criticized said they did not think the idea of giving employers a $3,000 tax credit for each employee they hire would work. ""I'd rather spend the money on the infrastructure, on direct investment, on energy conversion and other kinds of things much more directly and much more rapidly and much more certainly create a real job,"" said Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts. Several Democrats also said they were down on a tax proposal for payroll tax credits -- amounting to about $20 per paycheck and totaling $500 per person and $1,000 for couples earning less that $200,000 a year. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, said he doubted that proposal would do much to stimulate the economy. ""We have an example from the first stimulus that indicates just giving people $500 to $600, while certainly welcome when there's this much economic hurt, may not be the best use of stimulus,"" Wyden said. Instead, pumping more money into infrastructure spending would be more effective in creating jobs, Wyden said. None of the senators CNN spoke with after the Finance Committee meeting said they thought the opposition to these provisions would derail the bill but suggested that many meetings would be needed with the Obama team to hammer out an agreement. On the other side of the Capitol, House Democratic Whip Jim Clyburn, D-South Carolina, said Democrats were discussing including the alternative minimum tax as part of the package, in addition to the payroll tax cut and business tax credits the Obama team has proposed. Clyburn made it clear that Hill Democrats aren't inclined to give Obama everything he wants. ""Democrats are going to be Democrats,"" he said. ""We're creative thinkers. We don't believe in group think."" Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that House committees will begin action on Obama's proposed economic recovery package in the next couple of weeks, with a vote in the full House slated for the week after Obama's inauguration. In a speech Thursday, Obama said it was imperative that Congress move quickly to pass the stimulus package once he takes office. ""We start 2009 in the midst of a crisis unlike any we have seen in our lifetime, a crisis that has only deepened over the last few weeks,"" Obama said at George Mason University in Virginia.

"(CNN) -- A mystery stomach bug is striking down men's and women's players at the Indian Wells Masters tennis event, but former world No. 1 Roger Federer shook off illness to cruise to victory in his opening match. Federer, a three-time winner of the U.S. hard-court tournament, has been suffering with flu-like symptoms but breezed past Ukraine-born American wildcard entrant Denis Kudla on Sunday. The third-ranked Swiss won 6-4 6-1 in 57 minutes to set up a third-round clash with Canadian rising star Milos Raonic. The 16-time grand slam winner was one several players to fall sick at the California event, but Federer managed to avoid the intestinal illness which forced some of them to withdraw on Sunday. France's world No. 14 Gael Monfils and Austrian Jurgen Melzer were lost from the men's draw, while ninth-ranked Russian Vera Zvonareva and American Vania King pulled out of the women's tournament. Philipp Kohlschreiber, Andreas Seppi and Magdalena Rybarikova had earlier withdrawn. ""We're fighting something of our own in our family,"" Federer, who has twin girls, told reporters. ""We have tons of stuff going on at the moment. ""I have a bit of a combination. Not terrible temperature, but I have some things going on. But I'm the best off of the family, so thank God I'm the tennis player here. No, the rest of them are struggling much more."" Raonic, winner of two ATP Tour titles this season and seeded 27th, advanced courtesy of a 6-4 6-2 win over Argentina's world No. 38 Carlos Berlocq. World No. 2 Rafael Nadal was in similarly impressive form, brushing aside 78th-ranked Argentine Leonardo Mayer 6-1 6-3 in his first match since losing an epic Australian Open final to world No. 1 Novak Djokovic. Nadal is also participating in the doubles event and won his first-round match alongside compatriot Marc Lopez last week. ""It's nice to be back playing at a very good level,"" said Nadal, a three-time winner of this event who lost in last year's final to Djokovic. ""Winning is the most important thing. It's not easy to be back after a while without competition, but I did really well. I started the match very focused, very aggressive. I'm very happy about almost everything."" Next up for the 10-time grand slam champion is 26th-seeded compatriot Marcel Granollers, who beat Germany's former world No. 2 Tommy Haas 6-3 2-6 6-3. On a day of withdrawals, French sixth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga advanced after compatriot Michael Llodra was forced to retire with a knee injury while trailing 4-1 in the first set of their match. World No. 41 Llodra has reportedly been slapped with a $2,500 fine for racially abusing a member of the crowd during his victory over Latvia's Ernests Gulbis on Friday. Tsonga's next opponent will be Czech 28th seed Radek Stepanek, who beat Belgium's Xavier Malisse 6-2 6-1. Argentine ninth seed Juan Martin del Potro beat Australian qualifier Marinko Matosevic 7-5 6-2 to continue his bid for a third title of 2012. The 2009 U.S. Open champion will next play Spanish No. 19 Fernando Verdasco, who beat American Ryan Sweeting 6-2 6-2. In the women's draw, 2011 Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova was shocked by American teenager Christina McHale, slipping to a 2-6 6-2 6-3 defeat in their third-round clash. ""She played very solid and didn't make any mistakes, so it was tough,"" world No. 3 Kvitova said of the 32nd seed. ""The first set was fine today. Next time I play against her I will have to play the game I played in the first set -- a better serve, not many double faults, play aggressive and go for the net."" McHale, 19, who is searching for her first WTA title, said: ""It took me a while to get used to her big shots, but I definitely got a lot more comfortable as the match went on. It was definitely one of my biggest wins."" McHale will play 18th seed Angelique Kerber in the fourth round, after the German benefited from the withdrawal of King. World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka is safely through after a 6-1 6-2 victory over Russian 25th seed Svetlana Kuznetsova. The Australian Open champion's next opponent will be 14th seed Julia Gorges, who beat Spain's No. 24 Anabel Medina Garrigues. Chinese eighth seed Li Na beat compatriot Zheng Jie 6-1 6-3, and the French Open champion will next play Czech Klara Zakopalova, who profited from Zvonareva's withdrawal.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Turn back time, more than 90 years, to a cold case that won't gather dust. It's a classic whodunit, starting with the rape and murder of a 13-year-old girl and ending in a lynching. It was grist for a prosecutor's political aspirations, a case that was appealed all the way to the country's highest court and a story hotly debated in the national press. At the center of it all was Leo Frank, a northern Jew who'd moved to Atlanta to supervise the National Pencil Company factory. When the body of Mary Phagan, a white child laborer, was found in the basement, law enforcement homed in on Frank. He was tried and convicted, based on what most historians say was the perjured testimony of a black man, and sentenced to death. But when the governor commuted his sentence in 1915, about 25 men abducted Frank, 31, from the state prison and hung him from a tree in Marietta, Georgia. Considered one of the most sensational trials of the early 20th century, the Frank case seemed to press every hot-button issue of the time: North vs. South, black vs. white, Jew vs. Christian, industrial vs. agrarian. In the years since, it has inspired numerous books and films, TV programs, plays, musicals and songs. It has fueled legal discussions, spawned a traveling exhibition and driven public forums. Who murdered Mary Phagan? What forces were behind the lynching of Frank? Why should we still care? Answers to these questions, or theories, keep coming. ""Leo Frank was not a good ole Southern boy. He was different and not ashamed of being different,"" said Ben Loeterman, whose new documentary, ""The People v. Leo Frank,"" will air Monday on PBS. ""The test of us as a society is not necessarily how we treat the best among us but how we treat the most questionable."" Mixed in with ongoing analysis of the Phagan-Frank story are the descendants of those involved, people who learned of their connections differently and carry these legacies forward in unique ways. The accused . ""The story goes that no one in my family talked about it,"" said Cathee Smithline, a 62-year-old great-niece of Frank. Frank was the one who handed Mary Phagan her check when she stopped by the factory on April 26, 1913, Confederate Memorial Day. The night watchman, Newt Lee, would find the body and call police early the next day. Smithline, of Wyckoff, New Jersey, was 16 when she first heard about the case. Her mother sat her down, told her a story about what a man in the South had been through, said it was based on her uncle and handed over a book: ""A Little Girl is Dead."" It turns out Smithline's mother got the news in her teens, too, when her boyfriend turned to her after seeing ""They Won't Forget,"" a 1937 Hollywood film. ""You know that's about your uncle,"" he said. She'd grown up hearing Uncle Leo died of pneumonia, and after asking family about it, the truth was revealed, followed by the words, ""We will never talk about this again,"" Smithline said. ""I think it was a family embarrassment,"" she said. ""My grandmother [who died when Smithline was 1] was very close to her brother. It cannot be easy to tell someone your brother was lynched and why."" The first victim . Mary Phagan Kean was 13 when the story hit her. She was in a South Carolina classroom, and her name stopped short a teacher taking attendance. ""Mary Phagan, you say?"" she recalled the teacher asking, peering up from his list. He wanted to know if she was related to a girl with that name who died in 1913. Confidently, she told him she wasn't. But the boys on the playground taunted her anyway, telling her she was reincarnated from a dead girl. Traumatized, she asked her father about her name. ""He turned whiter than white,"" she remembered. Mary Phagan had been her grandfather's little sister. He only wept when asked about her. When Mary Phagan Kean's family moved back to Marietta, questions about that name never stopped. ""I went on a campaign,"" said Kean, 55, who sought out every article and piece of information she could find. ""I did that for years and years and years."" The consensus of historians is that the Frank case was a miscarriage of justice. Crime scene evidence was destroyed, they say. A bloody hand print was not analyzed. Transcripts from the trial vanished. Frank's conviction was based largely on the testimony of a janitor, Jim Conley, who most came to see as Phagan's killer. He'd written notes found with the body, but said they were dictated to him. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, used race in his argument, saying a black man couldn't be smart enough to come up with such stories. Witnesses would come forward to say Conley was seen carrying the body and washing out a bloody shirt. Conley's own attorney, William Smith, came to believe in Frank's innocence, scrawling a note to that effect on his death bed nearly 35 years later. Conley, who appeared in the press for petty crimes over the years, eventually disappeared. Dorsey, the prosecutor, had political aspirations riding on this win. ""A conviction of just another black guy wasn't going to do anything for his career,"" said Sandy Berman, the archivist at The William Breman Jewish Heritage Museum in Atlanta who created the traveling exhibit, ""Seeking Justice: The Leo Frank Case Revisited."" Two years after Frank's lynching, Dorsey was elected governor of Georgia. But the story was interpreted differently by Kean, who wrote ""The Murder of Little Mary Phagan,"" and stands by this conclusion: ""Leo Frank was guilty as sin. He was a sexual pervert."" Kean often visits her namesake's grave in Marietta. She's not the only one. She says she's struck by the teddy bears people leave there. The governor . Elizabeth Slaton Wallace couldn't be prouder of her heritage. At 81, she's the great-niece of the late Georgia Gov. John M. Slaton, the man who commuted Frank's death sentence to a life sentence, believing Frank's innocence would be proved and, in doing so, ruined his political career. The Georgia National Guard was called out to protect the governor after his decision prompted a rabble-rousing newspaper publisher to call for the lynching of both Frank and Slaton. Frank had been moved to the state prison in Milledgeville, Georgia, where an inmate slashed his throat. He survived, but weeks later about two dozen Marietta men came into the prison, with no resistance from officials, and abducted Frank in the dark of night. By dawn, he was hanging from a tree in Marietta. Photographs of his dangling body and the crowds who gathered there adorned souvenir postcards. ""Leo Frank was a Jew and a Yankee Jew at that. He was railroaded. Uncle Jack knew that,"" said Wallace, who lives in Atlanta. She can't explain why the story persists to this day. But throughout her life she's witnessed the kindness of the Jewish community, especially toward her father, who was named for the late governor. ""The Jewish community could never do enough for my father,"" said Wallace, who recalled being in a Jewish-owned store with her parents in the 1980s. ""They could have given us the shop."" As grateful as they were to Slaton, Frank's lynching left Georgia's small Jewish community frightened. Many left the state; those who stayed kept a low profile. For decades, they only spoke of Frank in hushed tones. The lynching party . The lynching of a white man can hardly be compared to what happened in the black community in the South. But this case, the only lynching of a Jew on American soil, was the culmination of a state-sponsored conspiracy, historians say. While Georgia Jews remained quiet, so did those who were involved in Frank's killing, said Steve Oney of Los Angeles, California, who wrote the authoritative book ""And the Dead Shall Rise: The Murder of Mary Phagan and the Lynching of Leo Frank."" It would be about 80 years before members of the lynching party were publicly, and not just secretly, known. ""They were not liquored-up yahoos,"" said Oney, a journalist, editor and Atlanta native who spent 17 years researching his book. ""These were smart, deliberate people -- from good, prominent families."" They included a former governor, a former mayor, a U.S. senator's son, a judge, lawyers, a state legislator and business owners. One of the 25 or so men was Cicero Dobbs, the grandfather-in-law of Roy Barnes, a Georgia lawyer and politician who is a former governor himself and will be running again in 2010. Barnes and his wife, Marie, never knew Dobbs, who owned a taxi company in Marietta and likely provided transportation to the prison where Frank was held. Oney broke the news about the family connection to them. ""Marie's parents didn't know. It was never mentioned,"" Barnes said. ""On death beds, people confessed. It was just that powerful."" Barnes, who is featured in the new documentary, said it's important to keep the story alive and learn from it. ""It's a terrible blot on our history,"" he said. ""How we keep it from happening again is to never forget.""","Mary Phagan's murder in 1913 spawned an Atlanta trial that's still talked about today .

""You're going alone, and you have to pay more for the pleasure. If you are feeling sorry for yourself, the single supplement is a real slap in the face."" Because of high fuel prices and the struggling economy, however, some industry experts say that tour operators and cruise lines may have trouble filling their slots in the coming year -- meaning single travelers could have luck getting around the dreaded supplement. ""But you need to know how to find the deals,"" says Lea Lane, author of ""Solo Traveler: Tales and Tips for Great Trips"" and editor of sololady.com, a site for single living. ""Single supplements are like rack rates -- you can usually do better."" Here are tips on how to find a sweeter deal: . Be the first one in line ... Tour companies sometimes scrap the single supplement for the first few people who book trips the operators believe may not sell out. For example, Singles Travel International will waive the supplement for the first six people who sign up for a Solo Super Savers trip to Europe in early 2009. BudgetTravel.com: Tips from solo travelers . To find this kind of early-bird special, ask a travel agent or check sites like sololady.com or Connecting: Solo Travel Network. CSTN lists its deals in a bimonthly newsletter that it e-mails to members -- the one-time fee to join is $50. Your best bet is to start looking at least six months before a trip's departure date, as most tours begin to fill up after that. ... Or wait till the last minute . Operators also occasionally reduce the single supplement as the deadline to book a tour approaches and they get desperate to sell any remaining spots. ""If you can wait until the last week [before the sign-up deadline], chances are you'll get a deal,"" says Lane. ""But it's a risk-reward kind of thing. You could miss out on the trip altogether."" Some companies, such as Backroads and Mayflower Tours, also offer what's known as a ""guaranteed share"": If they can't find a roommate for you before a certain date, you'll get your own double room at no extra cost. This works only if there's an odd number of men or women on a tour, so check in with the operator regularly before the deadline to see how many people have registered. Last-minute deals are possible on cruises, too. Some companies try to off-load unbooked cabins in the weeks before a departure by offering ""happy hour"" specials in which they reduce the supplement. The sales are typically held the same day they're announced on the companies' Web sites, says Amber Blecker, a travel agent who founded a Web site listing discounts on supplements for solo cruisers: singlescruiseresource.com. Most travel agents receive advance warning of the sales. Negotiate with the operator . You can always turn on the charm and try to persuade the tour company to drop the supplement. If you've got a good reason why you think you shouldn't have to pay, sell the operator on it. ""I've mentioned a recent divorce and a first trip after being widowed -- both true stories,"" Lane says. ""Usually, I ask the company to waive the single supplement and then hope for an upgrade."" Sometimes, you don't even need to give the company a reason -- just be friendly and make your preference for a private room clear. ""The person who makes the best impression will definitely stand out in the operator's mind and could receive a single room if it becomes available,"" says Beth Whitman, author of ""Wanderlust and Lipstick: The Essential Guide for Women Traveling Solo."" Small-scale tour operators, such as Country Walkers and Mayflower Tours, generally have more flexibility than larger companies when it comes to giving single travelers a break on fees. ""If the owner answers the phone, he can strike a deal right on the spot,"" says John Stachnik, president and co-owner of Mayflower Tours. ""With a large company, the reservationist can't really diverge from official policy."" He says to sweet-talk the booking agent by saying you will recommend the trip to friends and by stressing your discretion: ""Assure the operator that you will not share information about your discount with other travelers on the tour."" Travel when others don't . Discounts for singles abound in the less busy off-season -- summer in Mexico and the Caribbean, winter in Alaska -- when tours and resorts have difficulty filling all their spaces. Globus, for example, has no supplement on 11 of its tours in Europe this winter, saving people as much as $550 per trip. At the Club Med Turkoise resort in the Turks and Caicos, there was no supplement for solo travelers who booked a double room this past June. The off-season is also a good time to save on the supplement on cruise ships, although the companies often do not advertise the deals. For example, Blecker says that some cruise lines, such as Royal Caribbean, charge less for the supplement on what they call ""repositioning cruises,"" when companies move their ships from their summer cruising waters to their winter waters (from the North Atlantic to the Caribbean in the fall), or vice versa. ""These kinds of specials are out there with the mainstream brands, but they're not so easy to find,"" she notes. ""You should have a travel agent look on your behalf."" Try a European operator . Tour companies based in Europe are also less likely to charge a supplement, mainly because the fee is not an accepted part of the culture there. ""Europeans are not as couple-oriented when it comes to travel,"" says Lane. "" Plus, they're more cost-conscious and simply would not agree to pay the supplement, so tour operators have less choice. The market drives the cost."" In addition, European companies often offer accommodations in family-run pensions and older hotels, which have rooms of varying sizes -- including single rooms. For instance, Solo's Holidays, a British operator that specializes in organizing trips for singles, provides most of its customers with their own room at no additional charge.

"(CNN) -- English cricketer Kevin Pietersen has reached an agreement with the England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB) which paves the way for his return to the national team. Arguably England's most naturally talented cricketer, Pietersen was dropped by selectors in August after it emerged he had sent ""provocative"" text messages to South Africa's players during a recent Test series between the two teams. However the South-African born Pietersen must undergo a ""reintegration program"", before England team director Andy Flower can pick him. ""ECB and Kevin Pietersen confirm that agreement has been reached concerning a process for his reintegration into the England team during the remainder of 2012,"" said an ECB statement. ""Upon completion of the program, the England selectors will consider Kevin for future matches."" Without Pietersen, who was born in South Africa, defending champions England crashed out of the World T20 tournament in Sri Lanka at the Super Eight stage. Two years ago the allrounder was man of the tournament when England, captained by Paul Collingwood, were crowned T20 world champions in the Caribbean. In May, Pietersen had announced his retirement from T20 and one-day cricket, although he was in Sri Lanka working as a broadcaster for ESPN Star Sports. Andrew Strauss, who was England captain when Pietersen was frozen out of the team, has since retired from international cricket, with Alastair Cook the side's new Test skipper. ""Kevin Pietersen has apologized to Andrew Strauss and wishes to express to all those who support England his regrets at the impact the recent controversies have had on the England team,"" continued the ECB statement. ""He now wishes to put the events of the summer behind him and to focus on regaining his place in the England team."" The ECB went on to say the issue regarding messages sent from Pietersen's Blackberry mobile phone had been resolved. ""With regards the issue of the BBM messages, due to the fact that Kevin had not retained the BBM messages, this matter has been successfully concluded through a binding assurance provided to ECB by Kevin. ""Kevin conceded that the messages exchanged were provocative. The ECB is satisfied, following receipt of this binding assurance, that to the best of his recollection, Kevin did not convey any messages which were derogatory about the England captain, the England team director, the ECB or employees of the ECB. ""Furthermore, there was no tactical information whatsoever provided to members of the South African touring party."" ECB chairman Giles Clarke refused to put a timescale on when Pietersen might return. ""Kevin has signed a central contract today,"" Clarke told a media conference. ""Andy Flower will determine the progress of the reintegration process. It could be soon, it could be much later."" Pietersen admitted the situation had been difficult, but insisted he was focused on regaining his place in the team. ""It's been a horrible situation for all involved,"" said the 32-year-old cricketer. ""But it is time to move forward. All being well I'll be back in an England shirt as soon as possible."" Before he was dropped, Pietersen has been integral part of the England Test team since making his debut in 2005. He has scored 21 centuries in 81 Test matches for his country and was given the honor of captaining England's one-day team in 2008. The right-hander, who is an occasional spin bowler, will be hoping to win back his place in the team in time for November and December's tour of India.","Kevin Pietersen agrees return to the England cricket team .

"(CNN) -- A Christan pastor in Iran has been sentenced to death for allegedly renouncing his Muslim religion and another faces a possible indictment on the same charge of apostasy, according to a prominent activist group working for human rights in Iran. Youcef Nadarkhani, a 32-year-old member of the Church of Iran ministry and pastor of an approximately 400-person congregation in the northern city of Rasht, faces death, according to the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. In the southern city of Shiraz, another Christian pastor, Behrouz Sadegh-Khanjani, 35, is facing a possible indictment for apostasy. ""This is part of a greater trend of persecution against Christians,"" said Firouz Sadegh-Khanjani, brother of Behrouz and member of the Church of Iran's Executive Council. Christians are feeling the heat in other parts of the Muslim world as well. In Iraq, Christians have been attacked and many have fled their homes for other lands. In Pakistan, a Christian woman faces a death sentence for blasphemy for allegedly defiling the name of the Prophet Mohammed. On September 22, Iran's 11th Circuit Criminal Court of Appeals for the Gilan Province upheld the death sentence and conviction of Nadarkhani for apostasy. Apostasy is the ""act of renouncing one's religion,"" the human rights group said Tuesday, but it ""is not a crime under Iran's Islamic Penal Code. Instead, the presiding judge in Nadarkhani's case rested his opinion on texts by Iranian religious scholars."" ""It is the low point of any judicial system to sentence a person to death outside of its own legal framework,"" said Aaron Rhodes, a spokesman for the campaign. ""To execute someone based on the religion they choose to practice or not practice is the ultimate form of religious discrimination and disregard for the freedom of conscience and belief."" The judgment said Nadarkhani was born to Muslim parents but converted to Christianity when he was age 19 and it said that ""during interrogations Nadarkhani made a written confession admitting he left Islam for Christianity."" He said during his trial that his ""interrogators pressured him into making the statement,"" the campaign said. ""I am not an apostate. ... Prior to 19 years old I did not accept any religion,"" Nadarkhani said at trial, according to the campaign. Nadarkhani said he was coaxed by an interrogator into thinking ""that a person who is born to Muslim parents, and does not accept a religion other than Islam before reaching the religious maturity age (15 for males), is automatically a Muslim."" Nadarkhani's attorney on Sunday filed an objection to the sentence with Iran's Supreme Court. Two articles in the constitution grant Christians ""the right to freely worship and form religious societies"" and another ""obligates the Iranian government to uphold the equality and human rights of Christians."" The judge based his decision on constitutional provisions and Revolutionary Court ""civil procedures that instruct judges to consult sources when there is no codified-law that addresses a matter,"" according to the campaign. There is also a part of the penal code allowing ""judges to draw upon their personal knowledge when adjudicating cases."" ""More and more, the Iranian judiciary is departing from any recognized form of due process, issuing arbitrary judgments based on vague, open-ended laws,"" said Rhodes. ""Laws and evidence are increasingly irrelevant and unrelated to judicial outcomes in Iran."" Leonard Leo, chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, said the ""draconian language in the verdict makes it very clear that the Iranian authorities mean business. He could be executed at any time. And for what? For being a Christian."" ""We call upon the Obama administration and the international community to use every means available, to raise this issue and demand the unconditional release of Mr. Nadarkhani."" USCIRF officials said the last known execution of a Christian in Iran for apostasy was 20 years ago this month. The Rev. Hossein Soodmand -- a Muslim who converted to Christianity in 1964 and served pastor and evangelist in the Evangelical Christian Church -- was arrested and charged with apostasy and insulting Islam as a result of his own conversion and efforts to convert Muslims. He was hanged in December 1990. Also, there have been executions of people of the Baha'i faith in Iran, including one charged with apostasy in 1998, the officials said. In the Shiraz case, Firouz Sadegh-Khanjani told the campaign his brother was arrested in June. ""Eight members of his congregation including his wife were arrested two days later but were eventually released,"" he is quoted as saying. ""For several months he was in solitary confinement. We had no word from him and he had no contact with his lawyer. He has been moved to (prison) but we worry about the type of pressure he was under while in solitary confinement."" After his release from solitary confinement, Behrouz Sadegh-Khanjani and his lawyer, Mahmoud Taravatrooy, attended a hearing in which ""prosecutors sought to indict him for apostasy along with the crimes of acting against national security, propaganda against the regime, and insulting sanctities."" ""We are most concerned with the apostasy charge,"" Taravatrooy said. ""That's where most of my energy has gone, to save him from death."" The clergyman's brother said Sadegh-Khanjani was born to Christian parents and was never a Muslim, saying his mother is a Christian immigrant from the Congo and his father converted before he was born. ""Technically speaking, the court should dismiss this charge,"" said Taravatrooy, ""but the judge has to review the accusations first."" Taravatrooy told the campaign that his office asked some top clerics to issue opinions on apostasy under Islam. Four Ayatollah's, including the late Grand Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri, said that converting from Islam to one of the Abrahamic religions, including Christianity, is not construed as apostasy and the convert ""should be treated the same way as people of other religions would be,"" Taravatrooy said. Behrouz Sadegh-Khanjani was under temporary detention June 6 after he reported on a summons to the revolutionary court in Shiraz. At the time, he was free on bail stemming from a December 2009 arrest. But Sadegh-Khanjani's temporary detention order expired on October 18, Taravatrooy said. ""Technically he is being held illegally,"" according to the campaign.","The pastor facing death is from Rasht in northern Iran .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration pushed forward Sunday on a new path toward military action in Syria, urging Congress to support the president's call. Tests found signatures of sarin gas in blood and hair samples collected from the Damascus site of an alleged chemical weapons attack, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union. The samples were collected separately from a United Nations investigation into the August 21 attack and provide further proof that the Syrian regime attacked its own people, Kerry said. With ""each day that goes by, this case is even stronger,"" he said, arguing that the United States must act. ""If you don't do it, you send a message of impunity,"" Kerry said. Iran, North Korea, and Hezbollah ""will look at the United States and say 'Nothing means anything' -- that's what's at stake here,"" he said. Syria denies using chemical weapons on its people and blames the rebels. Kerry called the evidence ""overwhelming"" Sunday, and the Arab League issued a statement blaming the Syrian government for the attack. But the United Nations argued that world leaders should wait until U.N. investigators determine whether chemical weapons were used. 'Red line' debate: Are chemical weapons worse? ""The U.N. mission is uniquely capable of establishing in an impartial and credible manner the facts of any use of chemical weapons,"" Martin Nesirky, spokesman for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said repeatedly at a news conference. So when will the results be ready? The U.N. won't give a timeline, Nesirky said. ""It's being done as fast as it is possible to do within the scientific constraints."" Samples will be delivered to laboratories Monday, he said. The investigation involves a strict chain of custody and clear guidelines, he said, adding that two Syrian government officials monitored the process. But even when it's done, the U.N. will only say whether chemical weapons were used -- not who was responsible. Obama's last-minute Syria switch . U.S. military action appeared imminent until Saturday, when Obama announced he would first seek lawmakers' approval. Obama made a last-minute decision Friday evening to seek congressional authorization before any military action, senior administration officials told reporters. ""While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,"" Obama said Saturday. The 1973 War Powers Act technically allows him to strike without such approval. Lawmakers officially come back from recess on September 9. But some members of Congress arrived on Capitol Hill Sunday for a classified briefing on Syria with White House, State Department and Pentagon officials. Many of them said they remained skeptical and undecided about how to respond to the August 21 purported chemical weapons attack that U.S. officials have said killed more than 1,000 people in Syrian rebel strongholds. ""There was a great deal of skepticism in the room about the utility, effectiveness and support that we would have for the kind of strike that the president has proposed,"" said Rep. Jim Himes, D-Connecticut. ""There's not a lot of skepticism, frankly, about whether or not this was an attack carried out by the Syrian regime. While nobody would say that it's been proven, the vast bulk of the evidence suggests that this was an attack carried out by the Assad regime."" Sen. John McCain told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that Obama had invited him to a Monday meeting at the White House to discuss the next steps in Syria. McCain, who has been pushing for military intervention in Syria, said he had questions for the president. ""I want to find out whether there is a plan and a strategy. I want to find out whether this is just a pinprick that somehow Bashar Assad can trumpet that he defeated the United States of America,"" McCain told CNN. ""But I will say that if Congress overrules a decision of the president of the United States on an issue of national security, that could set a catastrophic precedent in the future. It would be a very dangerous precedent to be setting."" Obama's last-minute decision . Global debate surges over Syria . At a meeting in Cairo Sunday, Arab League foreign ministers condemned the chemical weapons attack, urging the international community to take action and calling for the prosecution of those responsible. ""The Syrian regime bears full responsibility for the use of chemical weapons (in) this heinous crime,"" foreign ministers from the regional organization said in a statement, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency. ""The council also called for providing the required forms of support for the Syrian people to defend themselves and the need for concerted Arab and international efforts to help them,"" the statement said. Arab League Secretary General Nabil el-Araby said in a Twitter post that the league was calling for the United Nations Security Council to ""assume its responsibility and take all the deterrent and needed measures against this crime and all crimes of genocide"" in Syria. But the statements Sunday did not directly refer to the United States, and it's unclear how much international support the U.S. government would have if it chooses to strike Syria. At the Arab League meeting, Saudi Arabia called for international action, but Egypt said it was opposed to foreign intervention in the Syrian crisis. Britain has voted against taking any military action in Syria, and France said it won't act without the United States as a partner. German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle tweeted Sunday that the time gained waiting for U.S. congressional approval ""must be used to reach a common position of the international community within the U.N. Security Council."" Amid the debate over whether to strike Syria, U.S. authorities are tightening domestic security measures. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security are warning of a higher risk of cyberattacks after months of disruptions by hackers known as the Syrian Electronic Army, and authorities say more attacks are likely. Opposition: Obama gave false hope . The shift to ask for approval from Congress left some analysts scratching their heads. ""The decision-making has been so confused and muddled that it's difficult to put the word 'wise' in front of anything they're doing right now,"" CNN's Fareed Zakaria said on Sunday. ""The administration has hesitated between nonintervention and intervention, and it is caught between those two."" The Obama administration, Zakaria said, ""seems to want to have it both ways, but it can't."" Others praised the president for taking a step to get more buy-in at home and abroad. ""Frankly, I think he looks prudent, and I don't doubt his resolve on this,"" John Negroponte, who served as director of national intelligence for two years under President George W. Bush, told CNN's State of the Union. ""I don't think he's looking for an excuse to get out from a box or a situation that he painted himself into."" While some praised the president for giving Congress a chance to weigh in, a key group of Syrian dissidents said it was surprised and concerned by Obama's new approach. ""We can't understand how you can promise to help those who are being slaughtered every day in the hundreds, giving them false hope, then change your mind and say let's wait and see,"" the Syrian National Coalition said. Iran, a staunch supporter of the Syrian regime, warned the United States will pay a price if it strikes Syria. Syria reacts . The Syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the August 21 attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against the regime. Maria Saadeh, a member of Syria's parliament, told CNN on Sunday that she sees no justification for a U.S. strike on Syria. ""There is no legitimacy to make this attack,"" she said, accusing rebel groups of using chemical weapons and committing other crimes against humanity. Syrian state media have been packed with critiques of the U.S. position since Obama's announcement Saturday. An editorial in the state-run Al-Thawra newspaper Sunday said that Obama had declared ""the beginning of a historic American retreat."" Meanwhile, the opposition Syrian National Coalition issued a statement aimed at U.S. lawmakers. ""The Syrian National Coalition calls on the American congress to carry their historical responsibility towards the Syrian people and take the right decision to support the American government approach to stop the killing machine of the Syrian criminal regime,"" the statement said. Iran: U.S. military action in Syria would spark 'disaster' Opinion: Why strikes in Syria are a bad idea . Sarin allegedly used previously in Syrian civil war . World leaders have said previously that sarin has been used in the Syrian civil war. In April, the United States said it had evidence sarin was used in Syria on a small scale. In May, a U.N. official said there were strong suspicions that rebel forces used the deadly nerve agent. In June, France said sarin had been used several times in the war, including at least once by the Syrian regime. Fast Facts: sarin gas . Dr. Sanjay Gupta: How 'gruesome' sarin gas can kill .

"(CNN) -- Cameroon joined Ivory Coast and Nigeria as African qualifiers for the World Cup finals with a 4-1 victory over Tunisia in Yaounde Sunday. Tied goalless from the first leg, the Indomitable Lions took a two goal cushion as Pierre Webo and Benjamin Moudandjo were on target. But Tunisia were given hope through Ahmed Akaichi's strike after the break until a Jean Makoun brace made it six final appearances in the last seven for Cameroon. On Saturday, the Super Eagles of Nigeria made the finals for the fifth time after easing to a 2-0 home win over Ethiopia for a 4-1 aggregate triumph, while the Ivory Coast held Senegal 1-1 in Casablanca to go through 4-2 on aggregate in a tense atmosphere. That match was played in Casablanca, with Senegal punished by FIFA for crowd trouble, but they gave Ivory Coast an uncomfortable time. Trailing 3-1 from the first leg, Senegal went ahead in the 77th minute after former Chelsea star Didier Drogba fouled Sadio Mane. Substitute Moussa Sow scored from the spot and another goal would have put Senegal through on their away goal, a last gasp strike from Newcastle's Papiss Cisse's in the first leg, but they could not grab a second. Kara Modji went close before Salomon Kalou made it safe for the Ivory Coast with a stoppage time equalizer to the relief of his teammates. Nigeria, leading 2-1 from the first leg, were given a comfortable cushion when Victor Moses, on loan at Liverpool from fellow EPL side Chelsea, scored from the penalty spot after Anyalem Hailu handled. Ethiopia put up a brave fight but the reigning African champions made sure of their passage when substitute Victor Obinna doubled Nigeria's lead after 82 minutes with a fine free kick. ""I am happy to be part of this history making. My target is now to help my country do well at the World Cup,"" he told AFP. Ghana, 6-1 winners over Egypt in their opener, and Burkina Faso, holders of a 3-2 lead over Algeria, are in action in the other two qualifiers Tuesday.","Nigeria and Ivory Coast first African teams into World Cup finals .

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. Many companies will want to confirm that your home office is a business-friendly environment. In the last few years, working from home has gone from being a rarity to a reality. With advances in technology, more people are able to link to work from their home computers or laptops. And as employees continue to crave flexibility and yearn for a better work/life balance, more people are working from home for at least part of their workweek. Home-based companies . While many companies are allowing existing employees to transition to various telecommuting options, some companies are also building work forces that are made up solely of employees working from home. Here is a sample of 10 companies that only hire at-home workers: . • Alpine Access is a call center company that uses customer service representatives that work from home. Employees use their own telephones and computers. The company provides representatives for clients like Office Depot and J. Crew. • Convergys hires home-based call center agents who provide support in customer service, and also supplies sales agents or help desk staff for companies. • Extended Presence provides their clients with outbound sales agents and marketing support staff who work from home. • Internet Girl Friday provides information technology support as well as administrative services for clients nationwide. • LiveOps provides customer service support for a variety of major corporations. • Spheris provides support to medical professionals. Their services include medical transcription and clinical documentation. • Staffcentrix supplies virtual assistants for business clients, including CEOs and upper management of major corporations. • VIPDesk provides call center support and also offers a home-based concierge service to clients. • Voicelog provides representatives to perform verifications for transactions done online or by telephone. Many states require changes to telephone service and other remote transactions to be verified by a third party, which VoiceLog provides. • West At Home also hires home-based customer service agents. They cater to a specific range of industries, specializing in health care and pharmaceutical support, as well as the hospitality industry. Employees need to meet some basic requirements, including having a telephone and access to a PC. Although the work is conducted from home, interviews for the job aren't always done remotely. Working at home is a growing and legitimate opportunity, but workers should still beware of any job that asks you to invest money, provide access to a bank account or give up a great deal of personal information up front. These are indicators of a possible scam. Traditional companies with home-based workers . Some traditional companies also have home-based workers in the mix as part of their overall staffing strategies. Companies as diverse as American Airlines, TDS Telecom, 1-800-FLOWERS, Sprint and Xerox have programs that enable traditional workers to transition to telecommuting or hire workers specifically to work at home. Aetna is one of the companies that has developed and implemented such a program. ""Our telework program started as a grassroots initiative to keep talented employees when there were site consolidations,"" Aetna Telework Program head Eileen Levin explains. The program, which started only a few years ago, has become very popular with employees. Levin notes that since the inception of the program, participation has jumped 300 percent. Around 10,000 Aetna employees, or 27 percent of the company's work force, now work from home. Levin says that the company looks at several factors before transitioning a job or task to be done at home. Aetna ensures that the employee is an appropriate candidate to work at home. It also confirms that the home office is a stable, business-friendly environment. And most importantly, Aetna carefully considers whether the job is an appropriate choice to be performed by home-based workers. Children's Healthcare of Atlanta is another company that is mixing traditional workers with employees who work from home. These home-based employees include medical transcriptionists and nurses who operate the hospital's Advice Line, a hotline where Laurie Peterson, one of the Advice Line nurses, has been working for CHOA from home for 11 years. She takes calls that vary from minor questions to emergency situations, and provides callers with a recommended course of action based on their conversations. Peterson says, ""I really enjoy being able to use my nursing judgment and experience right here in the convenience of my own home. We get inquiries from people both locally and all over the world seeking help with their child's health problems. At the end of a shift, it's very fulfilling for me to know I've helped allay a parent's fears."" If you're a worker who wants to transition from commuting to the office to working at home, talk to your company. Think about these discussion points before approaching your boss: . • Talk to the company about how offering this option to you and other employees will benefit them. Money talks, so be sure to refer to any potential savings the company will see by implementing this program. With gas prices at a record high, you should also underscore your savings, as well as the environmental benefits of working from home. • Not every job or every process can be done from home, so be ready with a plan. Identify jobs and transactions at the company that can be done easily, safely and securely from home. Copyright CareerBuilder.com 2007. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- Throughout Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio's campaign for New York's top political act, his backup band seemed to overshadow the headliner. His son Dante, a sophomore at a public high school in Brooklyn, appeared prominently in campaign ads, his soaring Afro a topic of conversation in political circles. Daughter Chiara, a college freshman, out-danced the rest of the telegenic family at the West Indian Day Parade with a move they called ""The Smackdown."" Watch the de Blasios dance ""The Smackdown"" A virtual unknown nationally despite 25 years in New York politics, de Blasio defied critics who questioned whether his experience as a city councilman from Brooklyn and, most recently, as public advocate -- a sort of civic watchdog -- sufficiently prepared him to run the Big Apple. He also ran Hillary Clinton's first U.S. Senate campaign. But his biracial family's increasing visibility resonated with residents of a city coping with a 21% poverty rate and increasing racial divisiveness brought on by the controversial ""stop-and-frisk"" policy allowing police to search people in high-crime areas. ""His family, just because of the racial mix, represents a big and increasingly large part of the city and speaks to certain sensibilities,"" said Harold Ickes, a veteran Democratic Party operative who advised the campaign and has known de Blasio for two decades. ""The family is very important to Bill... From the outside, this family represents a part of the city not represented in city government."" The de Blasio clan was featured prominently in commercials and campaign events. Dante, then 15, appeared in his own ad over the summer that highlighted his father's stance against ""stop-and-frisk."" Dante and his hair immediately became a social media sensation -- and de Blasio began to surge in the polls. In addition, Chirlane McCray, a political activist who once identified herself as lesbian before marrying de Blasio, emerged as a top campaign strategist. 5 things to know about New York's new mayor . DeBlasio, 52, portrayed himself as the ""unapologetically progressive alternative to the Bloomberg era,"" saying that the current mayor's polices favor the rich. He repeatedly used the Dickensian phrase ""a tale of two cities"" to describe New York City under billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The wealth inequality message appeared to have struck home with minority and low-income voters on Tuesday, giving de Blasio an advantage over Republican candidate Joe Lhota among black and Latino voters compared to white voters. ""The city is much more racially mixed than when Bloomberg took office,"" Ickes said. ""A lot of people having a hard time economically are black, Hispanic and Asian and Bill spoke elegantly to that."" De Blasio's critics accused him of dividing the city along economic and racial lines, and credited ""stop-and-frisk"" with a sharp crime reduction during Bloomberg's tenure. Appearing on CNN's The Lead with Jake Tapper on Wednesday, Bloomberg said he had a meeting with de Blasio and vowed to help with the transition. ""Keep in mind, I have a big vested interest in making Bill de Blasio an even better mayor than I was,"" Bloomberg said. ""We built a lot. We've given them a lot to work with... But the bottom line is, I'm going to live in New York City and I want Bill de Blasio's administration to be successful and our administration to do everything to transfer everything we've been doing over."" De Blasio, who has a bachelor's degree from New York University and a master's in international and public affairs from Columbia University, met McCray while working in the administration of David Dinkins, the city's first black mayor. When de Blasio delivered his acceptance speech late on Election Day, he was surrounded, like most of the campaign, by his family. The strapping politician, the first Democratic mayor in the largely-Democratic city in two decades, hugged son and daughter and planted a firm kiss on the lips of his wife before going on to thank the many people behind his triumph. ""The people I'm most grateful to and most grateful for are standing next to me,"" he said amid cheers and applause. ""My partner in life, my best friend in the world: she is brilliant and every bit as compassionate as she is tough, the love of my life Chirlane McCray."" He added, ""Of everything I have to feel fortunate about, I am most lucky, most blessed to be the father of two extraordinary children: Chiara and Dante. They make me proud every single day. And, my fellow New Yorkers, they are very stylish."" De Blasio greeted his supporters in both Spanish and Italian. McCray introduced him: ""From our family to your family, I give you the next mayor of New York City.""","Not everyone is a fan, though Mayor Bloomberg vows to help with the transition .

"(CNN) -- Helped by higher humidity, firefighters battled back a wind-whipped wildfire in Southern California, clearing the way for many evacuated residents to return home. The Powerhouse Fire is burning in the Palmdale area north of Los Angeles. It has destroyed some six homes, threatened as many as 1,000, and grew to more than 32,000 acres as of late Monday, according to Lisa Lugo with the Angeles National Forest. Three people have been injured since the fire started last week, though it was not immediately clear how. ""So far things look much better than they did yesterday,"" incident commander Norm Walker told reporters. ""Last night, we increased the containment to 40%. We hope to bump that up considerably again tonight if conditions remain the same."" Later, Lugo said that containment stood at 60%. Residents who evacuated from the communities of Lake Hughes and Lake Elizabeth were allowed to return home. However, the community of Antelope Acres remained under a mandatory evacuation order. A shelter has opened for those with nowhere else to go. Helicopters helped firefighters by dropping retardant and water along the perimeter of the blaze. ""We want to take advantage of the high humidity, get in there and do a direct attack and do all we can to get some of these hot spots put out so it doesn't spread anymore,"" Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Mike McCormick told CNN affiliate KABC. Elsewhere in the West, a small fire burned in Jefferson County, Colorado, prompting evacuations, according to the Sheriff's Office there. No structures were lost. Another fire, north of Pecos, New Mexico, has scorched about 8,000 acres and forced the evacuation of about 100 summer homes, said Denise Ottaviano of New Mexico Fire Information. That fire, known as the Tres Lagunas Fire, is 5% contained. Officials believe it was ignited by a downed power line.

"Washington (CNN) -- A congressional committee on Tuesday subpoenaed current and former top State Department officials related to the development of ""talking points"" by the Obama administration to publicly explain the deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, last year. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee sought documents and communications from 10 people, including the agency's No. 2 official, the top aide to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the department's former spokeswoman, the panel's chairman, Darrell Issa, said in a statement. The State Department has refused multiple requests to provide the communications and documents voluntarily, according to the committee, which has been investigating the administration's handling of the attack last September 11. The probe has centered partly on the evolution of unclassified CIA talking points requested by a member of Congress in the days following the attack for use in media interviews. A senior administration official, U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, wound up relying on them when discussing the attack on television news programs. White House releases Benghazi e-mails . ""The State Department has not lived up to the administration's broad and unambiguous promises of cooperation with Congress. Therefore, I am left with no alternative but to compel the State Department to produce relevant documents through a subpoena,"" Issa, a California Republican, said in a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry. But the State Department said it has responded in great detail to congressional inquiries about Benghazi, providing documents and other information since the attack by armed militants on the diplomatic outpost that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. ""The State Department remains committed to working cooperatively with the Congress, and we will take stock of any new or outstanding requests for information, and determine the appropriate next steps,"" said Patrick Ventrell, a department spokesman. The talking points have become a political flashpoint in a long-running battle between the administration and Republicans, who accuse it of not bolstering security before the attack, of botching the response to it and of misleading the public for political gain less than two months before the November election. The GOP suggests that the administration removed specific terror references and stuck to an explanation -- later proved untrue -- that the attack was result of a spontaneous demonstration over an anti-Muslim film that was produced in the United States. The White House and its allies in Congress have made the case that any confusion and conflicting information in the early hours and days after the assault stemmed from the ""fog of war,"" not any deliberate effort to mislead the public. Obama has called Republican concentration on the talking points a political ""side show."" Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Oversight panel, suggested Republicans continue to aggressively pursue the Benghazi investigation partly to tarnish Clinton, who is viewed as a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2016. ""This investigation has been politicized from the beginning as House Republicans accuse first and then scramble to find evidence to back up their unsubstantiated claims,"" Cummings said. The White House earlier this month released 100 pages of e-mails around the development of the Benghazi talking points in an effort to defuse the controversy by showing that officials working on them were focused on events, not politics. The e-mails indicate the CIA was likely the lead organization in developing the talking points with the State Department suggesting significant changes. But Issa said the e-mails released by the White House failed to answer the committee's ""outstanding questions."" He specifically cited reservations expressed by then State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland about key points in the early draft of the document. The draft was revised. Nuland, Deputy Secretary William Burns, Elizabeth Dibble, principle deputy assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs; Beth Jones, acting assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs; Patrick Kennedy, under secretary for management; and Cheryl Mills, counselor and chief of staff to Clinton, were among those named in the subpoena. Issa has given the State Department until June 7 to comply. CNN's Dana Bash contributed to this report.","Subpoena is directed at 10 current and former top level officials .

"(CNN) -- I believe in remakes. ""Father of the Bride,"" ""Ocean's Eleven,"" ""The Parent Trap""... Each version was a classic in its own time. And despite the fact that the recently announced ""Dirty Dancing"" remake -- most likely -- won't hold a candle to the 1987 dance flick, I'm optimistic. With all the buzz surrounding ""Dirty Dancing"" 2.0, which will be directed by the original film's choreographer, Kenny Ortega, it's easy to forget that this isn't the first reboot. In 2004, ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights"" was released. And this brings me to my confession: I really liked ""Havana Nights."" Before you skip down to the comments section and unleash fury, I am aware that ""Havana Nights"" isn't nearly as good as ""Dirty Dancing."" Diego Luna and Romola Garai don't even look like Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey's understudies. But if you take it for what it is, a dance movie with its own spin on a classic storyline, it's really an enjoyable flick. Plus, there are some pretty funny scenes -- whether or not they were intended to be comical, I'm not sure. ""Havana Nights"" worked because it didn't try to introduce us to a new Baby, a new Johnny Castle, or even a present day Catskills resort. It took what I have officially dubbed the ""Friends With Benefits"" approach: Same story, different movie. ""Friends With Benefits,"" starring Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake, hit theaters just six months after Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher's ""No Strings Attached."" Both films featured two friends attempting to engage in a casual, sexual relationship. Of course, in ""Dirty Dancing's"" case, 17 years went by before another film adopted the plotline. Like the original, ""Havana Nights"" is a period piece, of sorts -- it takes place during the late 1950s during the Cuban Revolution. At the beginning of the film, Katey (Garai) has just moved to Cuba with her family. There she meets Javier (Luna), a bus boy and talented Latin dancer who teaches her some moves. Just replace a few Kellerman's performances with a Latin ballroom competition, and substitute ""(I've Had) The Time of My Life"" for Mya's ""Do You Only Wanna Dance"" and you can probably fill in the rest. Also, I'm a sucker for movie montages. There's nothing better than watching a series of events play out while simultaneously listening to a catchy track. In the case of ""Havana Nights,"" about halfway through the movie, scenes of the couple rehearsing their moves on a rooftop and at the beach are backed by Wyclef Jean and Claudette Ortiz's ""Dance Like This."" They even have their own, less challenging, version of Swayze and Grey's dramatic lift. Here's my point: The movie wasn't trying to be the next ""Dirty Dancing."" It was simply recycling a winning formula. In the interest of full disclosure, ""Havana Nights"" absolutely bombed at the box office. With a budget of $25 million, it only grossed about $14 million nationally. It could have been the relatively unknown cast. Though, Luna had a budding career in Latin America before channeling Swayze in 2004. John Slattery and Sela Ward appeared in the film as Katey's conservative parents. Maybe people felt protective of ""Dirty Dancing,"" and chose to rebel against a film that dared to mooch off its name. With so many fans already up in arms over Kenny Ortega's impending update -- countless groups opposing the flick have popped up on Facebook this week  -- it will be interesting to see if people make it to the box office. I know I will.","I have a confession to a make: I enjoyed 2004's ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights""

"(CNN) -- Disneyland employees are paid to serve up magic and memories -- but not like this. A 22-year-old who works at the venerable Southern California theme park was arrested late Tuesday, hours after a small explosion in Mickey's Toontown section. The blast did not hurt anyone, but it did rattle nerves and prompt the evacuation of that part of the park for a few hours. Anaheim police on Wednesday identified the suspect in the explosion as Christian Barnes, a Long Beach resident and an outdoor vendor at Disneyland. Booked on suspicion of possessing a destructive device, Barnes is being held on $1 million bail. ""Barnes is cooperating with investigators and has indicated this is an isolated incident with unanticipated impacts,"" police said in a press release. It all stems from an incident around 5:30 p.m. (8:30 p.m. ET) Tuesday, when people heard ""a small bang"" coming from a trash can in Toontown. ""Just a big boom and the trash can exploding ... the lid coming up ... people were at a standstill,"" Vanessa Vasquez told CNN affiliate KCBS. ""It was kind of a little scary when I saw the whole area (look like a) ghost town."" Others said the sound is a rarity in the area. ""It was very tense at the moment it happened because you don't expect to hear that sound at Toontown,"" said Allen Wolf, another Disney visitor. Sgt. Bob Dunn, from the Anaheim police, explained the noise came from a plastic bottle with dry ice that exploded.

"Washington (CNN) -- History shows that second terms in the White House can be much tougher than first ones, and that is proving true so far for President Barack Obama. Less than five months in, Obama and his administration appear knocked off balance by a barrage of controversies and criticisms exacerbating the bitter political battles that marked his first four years in office. He's under fire from the right and left, accused by some of conspiratorial machinations to grab even more power than the leader of the free world legally holds. Headlines are dominated by scandals such as the Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups and classified leaks that disclosed details of the vast data mining and surveillance apparatus created after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Meanwhile, Republicans and some Democrats say his attorney general should resign over various issues including secret subpoenas of journalist phone records. Conservative Democrat: Holder should think about quitting . Now, late night comedians are making the controversies a staple of opening monologues, and even the first lady got heckled -- at a Democratic fundraiser, no less. While the issue was gay rights, the incident showed how Obama supporters also were frustrated by what they consider to be a lack of sufficient progress on progressive issues they expect the president to champion. CNN exclusive video: First lady confronts heckler . Second-term blues . Second-term blues have been the norm for presidents in recent decades, with Ronald Reagan facing the Iran-Contra scandal in the 1980s and Bill Clinton getting impeached over the Monica Lewinskly affair in the 1990s. To columnist and CNN contributor John Avlon, the latest Washington scandals ""have put the president off balance,"" with the administration on defense instead of driving the agenda. ""The choice will be in how the administration tries to deal with it,"" Avlon said. ""If it's in denial and acts like these events are occurring outside its purview or control, that will be a big problem."" Obama finds himself mired in topics and disputes far from his second-term agenda, in part because he maintained some of the national security policies of his predecessor that were adopted in a nation traumatized by 9/11, noted CNN Senior Political Analyst Gloria Borger. ""This is a president now who's dealing with issues he never thought he was going to have to deal with,"" Borger said Monday, referring to drone strikes, government surveillance and classified leaks. ""But when you continue some of the policies of George W. Bush, you're going to have some of the same questions that are raised about them."" How should Obama respond? Avlon and Borger agreed that Obama must be proactive in dealing with the newly revealed details about how the government has access to phone records and Internet activity as tools in fighting terrorism. Last week's leak of classified documents on the U.S. intelligence programs forced Obama to try to reassure the nation by declaring ""nobody is listening to your telephone calls."" However, the president who campaigned in 2007 by criticizing what he called his predecessor's claim of a ""false choice"" between civil liberties and national security following the 2001 al Qaeda attacks now argued that such a choice was inevitable. ""You can't have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,"" Obama said. ""We're going to have to make some choices as a society."" 12 moments in national security for Obama's team . Borger said Obama now needs to bolster his administration's explanation so far -- that Congress and federal judges have sufficient oversight to prevent abuses of the information available. ""I think he ought to get out there, speak with the American public, say not only why this kind of surveillance is defensible, but why he thinks it is essential in a post-9/11 world and lay it out there for the American people within the strictures of what he can say given the classified nature of the program,"" she said. CNN Chief National Correspondent John King noted that despite Obama's insistence his administration struck a proper balance between national security and domestic surveillance, critics from ranging from libertarian GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky to liberal Democratic Sens. Mark Udall of Colorado and Ron Wyden of Oregon are calling for more details and debate. ""If the president doesn't try to get ahead of it, guess what, he'll get dragged along with it,"" King said. Other issues on the table . On Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union said it filed a constitutional challenge to the National Security Agency program that collected information on phone calls, arguing it violated First Amendment rights to free speech and association as well as Fourth Amendment rights to privacy. The controversies come as the administration and Congress wrestle with other volatile issues, including a bipartisan push for immigration reform and a debate over whether to arm Syrian rebels. Avlon and King agreed that Obama needs to move forward on issues where progress can occur, and both cited the Senate immigration bill that would offer a path to legal status for millions of immigrants living illegally in the United States. Conservative Republicans fiercely oppose the measure, but more mainstream GOP legislators consider it vital to the party's hopes of building support among the nation's fastest-growing demographic -- the Hispanic vote. In last year's presidential election, exit polls showed Obama trounced GOP nominee Mitt Romney among Hispanic voters. ""The fact that immigration reform looks possible is significant,"" Avlon said, saying passage of a bill would be a ""significant legacy accomplishment"" for Obama and also a boost for Congress at a time of extremely low public approval ratings. Republicans led by Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama consider the immigration measure drafted by a bipartisan Senate ""Gang of Eight"" little more than amnesty for undocumented immigrants. They demand stricter border enforcement provisions before providing legal status of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. Despite such opposition, the Senate voted Tuesday to open debate on the measure, with many Republican foes joining Democrats on the procedural move. However, conservative Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas predicted that while the measure would pass the Senate, it had no chance of winning approval from the GOP-led House unless the pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants was removed. Meanwhile, the Obama administration is looking at possible options this week to increase support to Syrian rebels after resisting persistent calls for months to provide weapons. ""There is a recognition that unless we provide help, a lot of help, the situation is going to be very, very terrible,"" one senior administration official said. The official described a ""somber mood"" among Syria hands throughout the administration, who remain frustrated at inaction by the Obama administration in the face of a deterioration on the ground in Syria and spillover to neighboring states like Lebanon. GOP scrutinizes Justice Department . Republicans are quick to seize on any foreign policy objection with the Obama administration as an opening to attack former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is considered the leading possible Democratic presidential contender in 2016. In the House, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee has demanded more information on erroneous talking points by the administration four days after the terrorist attack last September on a diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Rep. Darrell Issa of California, the panel's GOP chairman, also is a leading critic of Attorney General Eric Holder over the botched ""Fast and Furious"" gun walking program and other issues. Holder now faces further scrutiny over the Justice Department's secret subpoenas of phone records for Associated Press journalists last year as part of an investigation of a classified leak. He has told legislators he recused himself from that case and never would prosecute a journalist for doing investigative reporting. Republicans question if Holder lied to Congress when he told a congressional hearing last month that he had no knowledge of any possible prosecution of journalists linked to classified leaks. Avlon said the various issues provide grist for Obama critics now, but the major factor in determining public opinion on a presidency will be the economy, which is moving in the right direction for the White House. ""Teflon presidents are Teflon in part because of the economy,"" he said, rejecting accusations by some conservatives that Obama's troubles amount to scandals that could lead to impeachment. ""The impulse to simply throw out Nixon narratives as a poster boy for the second-term curse is silly,"" Avlon added. ""This ain't Watergate and calls for impeachment reflect hyperpartisan wishes rather than reality."" Maybe not impeachment, but certainly fodder for television comedians. For example, David Letterman joked that for his daughter Sasha's birthday, Obama gave her Justin Bieber's phone records. CNN's Elise Labott and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","NEW: The ACLU says it filed a lawsuit against NSA domestic surveillance .

"(CNN) -- French police arrested a man Wednesday in connection with the weekend stabbing of a soldier in a business district of Paris, according to the Ministry of Interior. The suspect, who is being named only as ""Alexandre,"" will turn 22 on Thursday, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said in a news conference broadcast by CNN affiliate BFMTV. He converted to Islam when was about 18 years old, the prosecutor said. The attack is believed to have been motivated by religious ideology because the suspect prayed less than 10 minutes beforehand, Molins said, and because it came only three days after a soldier was killed in London, by attackers who spoke of Islam. In light of the evidence so far, police will continue to treat it as a terrorism incident, he said. The serviceman, age 23, suffered wounds to the neck when the assailant attacked him from behind with a knife or box cutter as he patrolled the capital's La Defense neighborhood. The attacker stabbed the soldier several times, Molins said. The suspect was identified through security camera footage and traces of DNA found on a juice bottle he left along with a sweater in a bag near the scene, the prosecutor said. He had a prior record of petty crimes committed when he was under 18 and is known to have been rebellious in his youth, but was not known to French security services, Molins said. His details were in the national police database because of an identity check made in 2007 when he was praying in the street. At that time, he did not appear to represent any threat, Molins said. Alexandre was arrested outside the home of a friend close to Les Yvelines, near Paris, where he had been staying because he has no permanent address, Molins said. Authorities do not believe the friend is connected to the attack, he added. The suspect can be held in police custody for 96 hours without charges being filed. Molins praised the work of French investigators in identifying him in only four days. The soldier was hospitalized with non-life-threatening wounds, the Ministry of Defense said in a statement. ""The aim was to kill the soldier because he was a soldier,"" Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told the CNN affiliate on Saturday. The attacker wanted ""to kill a soldier who is in charge of French security,"" he said. The attacker was wearing a robe at the time of the assault, a police spokesman said. The soldier was on patrol as part of a heightened security plan initiated in certain areas following France's intervention in Mali this year, French President Francois Hollande said. UK police continue to investigate the attack on a British soldier hit by a car and then hacked to death in southeast London last Wednesday. Moments after that assault, one of his alleged attackers was filmed saying the soldier was killed ""because Muslims are dying daily"" and that ""we must fight them as they fight us,"" an apparent reference to British and coalition forces' roles in conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. CNN's Stephanie Halasz and Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","Prosecutor: The suspect, a convert to Islam, prayed before the attack .

"(CNN) -- Boston is a land of memory. After all, it's the capital of a commonwealth, not just a state, evoking the colonial era. And when it comes to baseball, well, how many times have we heard the yarn about how the antique Fenway Park endured nearly a century of pain without a World Series championship? Now the Boston Red Sox have won their third title in nine years -- at Fenway, no less -- but this victory seems to hold deeper meaning than just winning a sporting crown. It's being compared to a divine balm to heal one of the darkest recent memories in America: the terror bombings at the Boston Marathon last April. On Saturday morning, a victory parade will make a symbolic gesture to confirm the restoration of a great city: the procession will cross over the marathon's finish line -- still marked on the street -- where the explosions occurred. The parade will follow the same route used to celebrate the team's championship in 2004, when it broke the streak for not winning a World Series, the team said. The team's last championship was in 2007. ""It lifts the spirit back up after the marathon,"" one woman told CNN in Boston during a post-game street celebration this week so loud that it wasn't possible to get her name. ""They obviously deserve it. I feel like I knew it was going to happen."" 5 things you need to know about the World Series . Many mused about the supernatural being at work. ""First the Boston Bombing and now the World Series...,"" said Michael David Reel on the Red Sox Facebook page, ""it was given to you."" It was as if Boston rose again after a trial of the spirit. ""This was not just about winning a Championship. It was about a group of regular guys that believed in themselves and this city, and this country, and through their unbelievable efforts it helped relieve the pain of the Boston Marathon bombing in April,"" wrote Dave Hornoff on the same social media page. ""They dedicated their season to the victims and the entire country embraced them, and they embraced Boston and the entire country. What we witnessed was a real life movie in the making and for me this was more than just sports. More championships will be won every year but the story of the 2013 Boston Red Sox will never be repeated."" Fans like Hornoff also repeated all or part of slogan that has since become a mantra in the marathon tragedy's aftermath: ""Boston Strong 617."" The terror explosions disturbed the nation because they occurred in such a public place: the attacks killed three people, wounded more than 260 others, and put the city in a five-day lockdown until a manhunt finally captured the sole surviving terror suspect. ""This World Series was so much more than just a baseball game for the city of Boston,"" Derek Lemieux wrote on the team's Facebook page. Then, signing off in a shorthand of the digital era, he wrote: ""#BostonStrong."" Immediately after the victory, some fans ran to Boylston Street, where the finish line of the Boston Marathon is still painted on the street. The April bombings occurred near this line -- which still says ""Finish"" -- and fans kneeled and kissed it. Jane Richard, 7, Boston bombing survivor, sings anthem at Red Sox game . Wednesday's win over the St. Louis Cardinals also marked the first time that the Red Sox won a championship while at home since 1918 -- the year that began the team's infamous 86-year World Series drought. Mysticism was behind that punishment, fans cried. It was the Curse of the Bambino -- the hex imposed on the team because it sold legendary player Babe ""Bambino"" Ruth to the New York Yankees in 1920. Indeed, 97-year-old Helen McGonagle of Boston was 2 years old when the team won that 1918 championship at home. ""I never thought I'd live to see this,"" she said of the 2013 championship. No story on the Red Sox would be complete without interviewing a Bostonian with such a long memory like McGonagle's. She now lives in a nursing home, still peppy enough to talk with reporters. ""I would go down and see the Red Sox a lot,"" McGonagle said of her childhood years at Fenway. Back then, a hot dog cost 15 cents, she said. Opinion: I'm a Red Sox fanboy . She explained the enthusiasm of fans. ""They're a great team,"" she said. ""I don't think as good as they were in Ted Williams' time, but I think they're doing a great job and I'm rooting for them all the time."" Batting legend Williams played for the Red Sox from 1939 to 1960. This year's team was also noteworthy for how players cultivated beards out of a superstition since spring training: The team kept winning as more players grew one, despite early predictions that this wouldn't their season. The season indeed ended as theirs. But one fan on Facebook now wonders: . ""Now can they shave?"" Robin Gilliam said.","NEW: Saturday's victory parade for team will pass site of the marathon's April bombings .

"SRINIGAR, Indian-administered Kashmir (CNN) -- The toll in the raging gunfights between the militants and Indian army in the Indian administered Kashmir rose to 19 Monday with the killing of four more Indian army troopers and five militants. Indian soldiers stand guard in Srinagar. The ongoing fierce gun battles in the densely forested and foliaged mountain range of Shamswari, the deadliest in recent months, entered its fourth day Monday. ""The thorough combing operation is in progress, and it is expected that a few more terrorists may be holed up in the area including an isolated house,"" Lt. Col. J.S. Brar, the spokesman of the Indian army in Srinagar said Monday evening. ""Four more soldiers of the army and five militants died Monday in this raging encounter that has been going on in the densely forested Shamswari mountain range in north Kashmir Kupwara border district today,"" Brar told CNN. A major of the Indian army's 1-Para regiment and three troopers were killed before yesterday in the gunfights during which six militants had also been killed. Reports also said additional troops had been rushed in to augment the already heavy presence of the army in the area. ""The operation which commenced on March 20 has been on for the last four days and has witnessed intermittent gunfights between the terrorists ensconced in the higher reaches of the dense forests and the soldiers,"" the spokesman said. In a separate incident one militant was killed in an encounter with police in south Kashmir's Shopian district Monday. Kashmir has been in the throes of a bloody secessionist campaign for nearly two decades in which, according to official figures, 43,000 people have been killed. Various rights groups and non-governmental organizations here, however, dispute the official statistics claiming that the number killed here during the last two decades is twice the official figure.","19 dead in Kashmir gunfights between Indian troops, separatist militants .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Records from a cell phone used by President-elect Obama were improperly breached, apparently by employees of the cell phone company, his transition team said Thursday. An Obama spokesman said the transition team was told employees at Verizon Wireless looked through billing records. Spokesman Robert Gibbs said the team was notified Wednesday by Verizon Wireless that it appears an employee improperly went through billing records for the phone, which Gibbs said Obama no longer uses. In an internal company e-mail obtained by CNN, Verizon Wireless President and CEO Lowell McAdam disclosed Wednesday that ""the personal wireless account of President-elect Barack Obama had been accessed by employees not authorized to do so"" in recent months. McAdam wrote in the e-mail that the phone in question has been inactive for ""several months"" and was a simple voice flip-phone, meaning none of Obama's e-mail could have been accessed. The CEO also wrote the company has alerted ""the appropriate federal law enforcement authorities."" Gibbs said that while the Secret Service has been notified, he is not aware of any criminal investigation. He said he believes it was billing records that were accessed. Gibbs said that anyone viewing the records likely would have been able to see phone numbers and the frequency of calls Obama made, but that ""nobody was monitoring voicemail or anything like that."" Verizon Wireless, meanwhile, has launched an internal probe to determine whether Obama's information was simply shared among employees or whether ""the information of our customer had in any way been compromised outside our company, and this investigation continues,"" according to McAdam. In the e-mail, McAdam said that employees who were permitted access to these records will be allowed to return to work, but employees who accessed the account for ""anything other than legitimate business purposes will face disciplinary action, up to and including termination.""

"(CNN) -- With its vast array of freaky specimens that seem to belong in some haunted manor, Philadelphia's 150-year-old Mutter Museum may be the gold standard in medical museums. But it's not alone. Museums dedicated to niche medicine, pathology, anatomical curiosities and cultural trends keep visitors fascinated and appalled with their educational and grotesque displays. Whether it's an oversized parasite, a diseased organ preserved in formaldehyde or a historical look at the outrageous medical practices of yore, there's bound to be an address to discover some sort of unnerving discovery even in less traveled destinations. In honor of International Museum Day on May 18, here are the world's weirdest medical museums. Bart's Pathology Museum, England . A university collection started in 1879, this exclusive medical oddity exhibit is part of the Queen Mary, University of London. It's open only for special soirees and events that fill up quickly. It's even hosted a pop-up cake shop by Eat Your Heart Out bakers. The nearly 5,000 specimens include various objects pulled from human bodies over the last 150 years -- toothbrush in the esophagus, anyone?

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistan Taliban's No. 2 leader was killed in a drone strike Wednesday in the country's tribal region, a local tribal official and an intelligence official confirmed to CNN. He was Wali-Ur Rehman Mehsud -- second in command to Hakimullah Mehsud, the militant group's leader. The Pakistan Taliban's spokesman told CNN he could neither confirm nor deny the information. The sources said Rehman was killed along with his close aide, Fakhar-ul-Islam, and two Uzbek nationals whose identities the sources didn't know. Opinion: Pakistan vote the first step on a long road . This is the same strike reported earlier by intelligence officials in Pakistan, who said seven people were killed and one other was injured in the attack at a compound near the town of Miranshah in the North Waziristan district. Rehman was wanted by the United States on suspicion of being involved in the December 2009 suicide bomb attack that killed seven CIA employees at Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost, Afghanistan, according to a publication by the U.S. National Counterrorism Center. The publication described him as the Pakistan Taliban's No. 2 leader and chief military strategist, and said he participated in cross-border attacks in Afghanistan against U.S. and NATO personnel. The United States has long conducted drone strikes in its fight against suspected Taliban and Pakistani jihadist groups in Pakistan near the Afghan border. This one is the first known hit since Pakistan held general elections on May 11 and since President Barack Obama announced his new counterterrorism policy last week. The last reported drone strike in Pakistan was in mid-April. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Wednesday that he couldn't confirm reports of Rehman's death, but he said the militant was wanted for the Khost incident and mentioned his participation in attacks. ""It's important to note who this individual is,"" he said. Carney read a portion of Obama's counterterrorism speech that laid out standards for taking action. ""In the Afghan war theater, we must support our troops until the transition is complete at the end of 2014. That means we will continue to take strikes against high value al Qaeda targets, but also against forces that are massing to support attacks on coalition forces. However, by the end of 2014, we will no longer have the same need for force protection, and the progress we have made against core al Qaeda will reduce the need for unmanned strikes,"" Carney said, reciting the address. Core al Qaeda is a reference to the terror group along the Afghan-Pakistan border. Opinion: 9 myths about drones and Guantanamo . Drone strikes have become controversial and unpopular because they have killed civilians, and Pakistan has said it has ""serious concerns"" over the latest attack. Pakistan, which describes itself as a front-line state in the fight against terrorism, said it has ""consistently maintained that the drone strikes are counterproductive, entail loss of innocent civilian lives, have human rights and humanitarian implications and violate the principles of national sovereignty, territorial integrity and international law."" When Obama discussed drone strikes last week, he said they must be used with more temperance and caution, but they remain a necessary tool to take on terrorists. By The Numbers: Drones . ""It is a hard fact that U.S. strikes have resulted in civilian casualties, a risk that exists in all wars,"" Obama said. ""As commander in chief, I must weigh these heartbreaking tragedies against the alternatives. To do nothing in the face of terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties."" Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani politician who is expected to serve as the next prime minister, has said he plans to address the unrest in his country. Talks with militants such as the Pakistan Taliban should be taken seriously, he has said. Taking on militants in Pakistan . The United States, in its fight against terrorism, has been using drones to go after militants it calls high-value targets. The Long War Journal, a website that tracks, reports and analyzes the U.S. fight against terrorists, said the United States has launched 14 drone strikes so far this year. Opinion: Add morality to list of drone victims . ""The number of strikes in Pakistan has decreased since the peak in 2010, when 117 such attacks were recorded. In 2011, 64 strikes were launched in Pakistan, and in 2012 there were 46 strikes,"" the journal said. The strikes have been confined mostly to North and South Waziristan, the journal said, with 322 of the 339 strikes recorded since 2004 occurring in those two tribal regions. Obama and other U.S. officials have stressed that al Qaeda's core in Afghanistan and Pakistan is being degraded. In his speech, Obama said al Qaeda in that region is ""on a path to defeat."" Asked how many high-value targets like Rehman are left in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, Bill Roggio, the Long War Journal's editor, estimated the number is at least in the dozens, including members of the Pakistani Taliban. ""Al Qaeda has replaced its top leadership, often using seasoned Pakistani jihadists from the cadre of Pakistani terror groups,"" Roggio said, citing such militant movements as Harakat ul Mujahideen, Lashkar-e Jhangvi, Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami. Peter Bergen, CNN national security analyst, said it's hard to say how many high-value targets are left because people keep being added to the list. He also said many militants remain concentrated in the rugged North Waziristan region, where the army's lack of clearing operations makes it safe for jihadis to operate. CNN's Shaan Khan reported from Pakistan, with Joe Sterling reporting and writing in Atlanta. Journalist Zahir Shah Sherazi and CNN's Pam Benson and Jason Hanna also contributed to this report .","NEW: Rehman was wanted by U.S. in connection with 2009 attack that killed CIA employees .

"(CNN) -- For many months Syria's rebels have begged the international community to supply them with the weapons they say they need to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad. Now, their desperate pleas for help are one step closer to becoming reality after the EU lifted its arms embargo on Syrian rebels, clearing the way for European countries wishing to try to level the playing field in a horrific civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 70,000 people. But can EU weapons turn the tide in the rebels' favor in Syria, or is it already too late? CNN examines the core questions behind the announcement. Why has the embargo ended and what does it mean? The weapons embargo on Syrian rebels, along with a series of other Syria-related bans and sanctions, was scheduled to expire on Saturday. But while the EU's 27 member countries were able to reach the required consensus to extend all other bans, Britain and France refused to agree to an extension of the arms embargo. The lifting of the embargo comes with conditions -- EU countries wishing to send weapons to Syria's rebels may only send them to the moderate Syrian National Coalition and the affiliated Free Syrian Army, and they may only be used to protect civilians, according to a statement from the EU. LATEST: Lebanon 'hit by rockets from Syria' While the ban will technically be lifted on Saturday, it is expected that the earliest EU countries would send weapons to the rebels would be August, so as not to imperil the prospects of a U.S. and Russian-brokered peace conference scheduled to take place in Geneva in June. What countries would send weapons? Britain and France led efforts to lift the embargo. Both nations suggested joining countries such as Qatar in providing weapons to rebels, arguing such a step would strengthen moderate rebels and make them less reliant on well-armed extremists in their ranks. ""It was important for Europe to send a clear signal to the Assad regime that it has to negotiate seriously, and that all options remain on the table if it refuses to do so,"" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. But the lengthy negotiations over the arms ban to rebels exposed the deep divisions in EU countries' foreign policies -- with Britain and France arguing forcefully to lift the embargo, while nations including Austria and Sweden expressed fear that more weapons will only make the bloodbath in Syria worse. Q&A: Is Syrian war escalating to wider conflict? What kind of weapons would be sent? EU countries are free to send what they like to Syria's rebels, according to CNN's Nick Paton Walsh -- provided the weapons go to the Free Syrian Army and can be justified as protecting a civilian population. Western countries could conceivably provide rebels with small arms and ammunition. But they're unlikely to provide rebels with the arms they need most -- like portable shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles (MANPADS) to counter Assad's domination of Syrian air -- out of fear they'll fall into the hands of radical Islamic militant groups such as al Nusra Front, which the U.S. says is affiliated with al Qaeda. Without anti-aircraft missiles or heavier armor-piercing ammunition, experts say it's unlikely that the rebels will be able to win the war. ""So far it's the Assad government's ability to use air power against rebel held territory that's really insured the insurgency can't make any significant gains,"" said Charles Lister, an analyst at IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Centre. ""Unless they send really significant weapons like MANPADS, I find it hard to imagine that any other provision of weapons will turn the tide of the conflict."" When Syrian rebels have obtained anti-aircraft and anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) in the past they've been very effective, according to Lister, who says social media and militant group videos appeared to reveal an influx of Yugoslavian anti-tank weapons into rebel hands in southern Syria earlier this year via Jordan. ""The ATGMs had a fairly significant impact on the conflict in the short term, in that they did allow rebels to take out tanks more effectively than they'd been able to previously,"" Lister told CNN. ""But these weapons very quickly went into the hands of militant Islamic groups like al-Nusra."" Opinion: Syrian hostilities bring Middle East catastrophe closer . How to get the weapons into the country? There are two main routes to get weapons to rebels in Syria, says Lister -- through the northern Turkish border or through the southern Jordanian border. Smuggling weapons via Turkey is unlikely, however, because northern Syria's insurgency is dominated by the kind of radical militant groups the West is trying to avoid arming. Jordan's strong ties to the West, its stability, and its links to the Free Syrian Army make it the most likely place to smuggle weapons through, says Lister. ""In 2012 the FSA coordinated several high profile defections whereby the group's militants transported senior government officials across the border into Jordan. There have also been unverified reports that a small core group of FSA members have been receiving military training in northern Jordan. All of that would tend to suggest that if weapons were to be sent through to militants, they would go by Jordan,"" he said. How can EU countries prevent extremists from obtaining the weapons? It is nearly impossible to prevent extremists from gaining possession of weapons once they're smuggled into Syria, according to Fawaz Gerges, Director of the Middle East Centre at the London School of Economics. ""Once you deliver weapons into a theater of operation, no one can have control or track who takes ownership of the weapons,"" Gerges said. ""Britain and France are aware the weapons could fall into the wrong hands, but they're willing to take a risk."" This risk hasn't panned out before -- Lister says that the heavy Yugoslavian arms that allegedly flowed to rebel forces in Daraa, southern Syria around the turn of the year quickly wound up in the hands of radical militants in northern cities battling alongside the moderates in Aleppo. ""The conflict is so interdependent -- in all local theaters across the country, FSA and other moderate groups regularly coordinate with groups like al-Nusra. It's unrealistic to expect that a foreign state could provide weapons to one group and never expect the weapons to appear in other groups' hands."" Gerges says the greatest fear is that a radical group could use EU weapons to attack civilian or Western interests within Syria: ""One major incident, for instance the targeting of a civilian aircraft, would change the whole conflict and have major ramifications."" Interactive: War not only about Syria . Is the lifting of the EU embargo a game changer for Syria? Without an influx of heavy weaponry, experts say the lifting of the embargo won't change the reality on the ground: Assad's regime is on the offensive, and the influx of Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon means there is little the rebels can do to slow their progress at the moment. The real goal of the EU announcement, Gerges said, is to try to ""maximize the chances of a diplomatic breakthrough"" at the upcoming Geneva peace talks -- if the talks go ahead. ""The logic is to exert pressure on Assad and change his calculations. Britain, France and the U.S. want it to be an instrument to exert pressure at the negotiating table and get Assad to be genuine and serious about political talks. But without direct American involvement in the conflict, neither Assad nor his allies will take the EU decision very seriously."" The irony of the situation, Gerges said, is that while the U.S. President Barack Obama wants Europe and/or Syria's neighbors to ""take ownership"" of the conflict, no country will do that without the United States taking a leadership role on Syria. ""The announcement is not a game-changer,"" Gerges told CNN. ""I doubt very much whether it will make a difference in the raging struggle inside Syria."" Will the embargo's lifting turn the conflict into a regional war? Those opposed to lifting the embargo say it could escalate the flow of weapons into Syria from all sides -- a fear that was realized hours after the announcement when Russia declared it would send sophisticated S-300 surface-to-air missiles to the Syrian government in accordance with a contract signed several years ago. ""We believe that moves like this one to a great degree restrain some hotheads from escalating the conflict to the international scale, from involving external forces,"" said Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov, according to the state-run Russia Today news agency.

""The conflict in Syria has gone too far; it has mutated from an internal conflict to a regional war by proxy. So even if Britain and France decide to arm the opposition today, not in August, Russia and Iran will deepen their involvement in Syria and counterbalance any move by the EU,"" he told CNN. ""The EU's announcement is a simplistic reading of a complex situation, because we're beyond that with Assad. This is a war to the bitter end. This is a zero-sum game.""

"(CNN)  -- Fernando Verdasco beat Swede Robin Soderling 6-3 4-6 6-3 to claim the Barcelona Open crown on Sunday and ensure a Spanish winner of the clay court tournament for the eighth successive year. The fifth seed Verdasco might have been demoralized after his straight sets rout at the hands of Rafael Nadal in the Monte Carlo Masters final last weekend, but showed his fighting qualities against Soderling. With defending champion Nadal opting not to defend his title at his own club, Verdasco took advantage to add to his San Jose title success earlier this year. He follows compatriots Carlos Moya (2003), Tommy Robredo (2004) and Nadal for the last five years in keeping the trophy on home soil. ""I'm very excited and happy to win this tournament. I wasn't originally going to play this week, but I got a wild card and here I am,"" he told the ATP Tour's official Web site. ""I've been training here since the age of 15. Watching the Barcelona Open for me has always been a very special tournament."" Verdasco broke the big-hitting Soderling in consecutive service games as he took the opening set. Soderling, who beat Nadal en route to last year's French Open final, showed his ability on clay by winning the second to set up a decider. But the home hope broke Soderling again in the fourth game of the third set and served out to clinch the title. Nevertheless, it was a promising first appearance of the season on clay for Soderling as he builds up to the French Open at Roland Garros from May 23 where Roger Federer defends the crown.","Spain's Fernando Verdasco claims Barcelona Open title .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In energy-sapping conditions, the British and Irish Lions hardly had to bare their teeth to comprehensively beat the Barbarians 59-8 in the first match of their rugby tour to Australia. ""It was a good run-out and what we wanted. It was a little tougher than the scoreline suggests,"" Lions head coach Warren Gatland said after the match in Hong Kong. ""I think the scoreline reflected our dominance. I was genuinely very, very pleased with that today. It was tough out there. The players said (the ball) was a like a bar of soap with the humidity and the heat."" In the hot and sticky night air -- the temperature hovering around 30C in the windless Hong Kong Stadium -- the Lions ran in eight tries to one against the scratch team of internationals that last weekend had lost 40-12 to England. Led by the normally dynamic captain of Italy, Sergio Parisse, who said the conditions were the toughest he'd played in, the Barbarians forwards seemed determined to physically test their opposition early on. Scottish fullback Stuart Hogg, the Lions' youngest player at 20, looked to get his tour off on a positive note but the beginning of a scything run a couple of minutes into the match was brought to juddering halt by a crunching tackle by Barbarians center Casey Lualala. Then after just eight minutes South African Schalk Brits, forgetting any club loyalty, sent a punch towards his Saracens teammate and Lions flyhalf Owen Farrell, earning the Barbarians' hooker a yellow card and 10 minutes off the field. It could easily have been red. ""From our point of view, the good thing is that Owen wasn't injured or knocked out, and from a rugby perspective I'm glad (Brits) wasn't sent off, it was just a yellow card, because it would have been less of a workout for us and the rugby as a spectacle,"" said Gatland. ""One of the things we're going the emphasize very strongly is to make sure we keep our discipline. It's going to be hugely important for us. Sometimes you need to take one for the team, you need to get 'whacked' and you can't retaliate because the consequences of that retaliation can be pretty severe as well."" Swinging arms aside, there was little of note to get the 28,643 spectators excited about in a slow-paced first half until Irish lock and match-day captain Paul O'Connell lunged over the line for the first try of the Lions tour. Soon after, Welsh scrumhalf Mike Phillips' darting run from the back of a ruck extended the Lions' lead to 20-3, while Farrell slotted over a last-minute penalty to make the score 23-3 at halftime. Another Phillips try, touched down with a swallow dive three minutes after the restart and converted by Farrell, killed the match as a contest and put the Lions 30-3 ahead. The tries then came regularly as the game opened up. So too did the handling errors, especially for Farrell, who, while dead-eyed with the boot often seemed to have his palms smeared with treacle; what seemed a certain try for the Lions was denied by Barbarians fullback Jared Payne when he swatted the ball out of the path of Sean Maitland from an overhead Farrell pass. The lone try for the Barbarians -- a breakaway effort after 58 minutes by Kahn Fotuali'i -- was only limited respite from the one-way traffic as the Lions continued to dictate play. A misplaced pass by the Barbarians in their own 22 later led to a try for Lions center Jonathan Davies before Welsh winger Alex Cuthbert ran in two tries to push the score to 47-8, while his compatriots Dan Lydiate and Alun Wyn-Jones completed the rout. O'Connell was pleased with the performance from a team that has only had a few weeks to bond. ""You just want to get into it,"" he said. ""We can show guys the video now (from the match) the chats will begin amongst players and the tour really starts and takes off from here. For some of us being in camp for three weeks -- three weeks without a game is a long time, so it's great to get the tour started. The squad fly to Perth Sunday for their first game against Australian opposition, the Western Force, on Wednesday. Gatland was content to get his team through their sweltering Hong Kong experience unscathed, and was encouraged by the players' performances. ""Going forward I think these players that have played tonight have laid down a marker and the players that get picked and play against the Force they will know they will have to perform,"" the New Zealander said. ""Today's performance wasn't about Australia it was about us, and us putting down some foundations in place; the first two or three games are about that. ""We'll start concentrating on looking at the Australian sides more closely than we have because the focus has been getting this first game under our belts, we'll look at the tapes of their recent performances and the buildup to that first Test in Brisbane."" ""We're well aware that in Perth the microscope is going to be on us a heck of a lot more than it has been at the moment.""","British and Irish Lions begin tour with a 59-8 win against Barbarians in Hong Kong .

"(CNN) -- The image makers were in overdrive at the Republican National Convention this week. They finally had their candidate but now they had a problem: The guy wasn't likable. And nowhere was that problem more acute than with women voters. Concerns about Mitt Romney's slash-and-burn economic approach at Bain Capital, coupled with displays on the campaign trail of his stunning lack of empathy had shaken confidence among women voters. Add in the wound reopened when Senate candidate Todd Akin spoke aloud the GOP's twisted ideas about women and rape and pregnancy, and the mandate to the handlers was infinitely clear: Make every night Ladies' Night at the Mirage in Tampa. The show kicked off with Ann Romney headlining the first night. Her speech overflowed with love for her husband and family, and she deftly attempted to transfer those warm and fuzzy feelings to the women viewers. ""I love you women! I hear your voices,"" she shouted at us as her husband's proxy. Throughout the week, prominent women, such as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, headlined high profile events. Vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan regaled us with tales of his truly amazing mom. And as Romney prepared to take the stage on the final night, a soft-focus video brought the love between Ann and Mitt into full technicolor, while walk-ons from women of lesser stature were scattered throughout at a reassuring pace. By prime time, we couldn't miss the marquee message: Mitt loves women, so keep calm and carry on. Mitt's largely biographical speech was light on substance and long on references to the ladies who had shaped him and supported his career, including those in senior leadership of his governor's cabinet. His shout out to South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who had appeared that week on the dais, gave him an opportunity to invoke his mother's posthumous approval of how far women have come. Opinion: Did Romney gain ground? Then, in a deluge of red, white and blue balloons, the pretty show ended and the workers began to dismantle the Mirage, leaving the harsh sunlight of the day-after to reveal the intractable reality of what a Romney-Ryan presidency would mean for American women. Women voters care most about the economy and jobs. But with a critical caveat: nine out of 10 women say that a candidate must ""understand women."" To do that requires an acknowledgment of two things: that women's economic security -- by almost every measure -- still lags behind that of male counterparts and that their economic security is inextricably tied to their ability to control their health, including reproductive choices. And on those points, no illusions and tradesman's tricks can obscure the fact that the GOP agenda fails the test. A July National Women's Law Center report showed that the 2007 Bush recession cost nearly 7.5 million jobs and recovery has been slow to reach women workers. Public sector job loss drives this disparity. While Romney's jobs plan is still notoriously vague, with little to offer other than a regressive nod to trickle-down economics, Paul Ryan has been frighteningly clear that his top priority is essentially dismantling our government -- a fixation projected to result in a whopping 4.1 million lost jobs over two years. Even the lucky few women who hold or get jobs under a Romney-Ryan administration are likely to be paid far less for equal work. In the aggregate, women are paid on average 77 cents on the dollar to men, but Romney still refuses to support the Lilly Ledbetter Pay Check Fairness Act. Opinion: Is that the best Mitt Romney can do? What of the women who can't get jobs? They can look forward to victimization and vilification. The 24 million women who live in poverty in America span all ethnic groups, with single moms twice as likely to be poor as single dads. Still, Ryan has proposed cutting nutrition assistance to these households, often the only thing that stands between them and malnutrition. Romney has not disagreed. Meanwhile, in a cynical race play, the Romney campaign's deceptive ad campaign attacking welfare recipients has denigrated these women instead of offering solutions. Adding insult to injury, Romney's Republican platform includes an extremist anti-abortion amendment that removes exemptions even for rape and incest victims. A party that eliminates a woman's right to choose while at the same time cutting pay, jobs, and access to health care and food security exposes a bizarre and dangerous lack of understanding of the challenges facing American women. No matter how much love bounced around the walls of the Tampa Mirage, in real life, lip service and speeches -- even by women -- don't feed the family. What women need is a sober assessment of how economic challenges uniquely affect us and solutions that reflect that understanding. And despite their best efforts over the last week, that's one promise that a Romney-Ryan presidency can't deliver. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ilyse Hogue.","Ilyse Hogue says the GOP tried hard at convention to show they are on women's side .

"(CNN) -- At 16, my innocence was shattered when two gunmen murdered 13 people at my school and wounded countless others. Columbine High School promised to be a safe and secure place of learning. And that promise was broken on April 20, 1999. On that morning, I headed to school worried about my 10th grade math test and my upcoming track meet. Useless worries: The test was never given and we never held the meet. Scars remain from that day that no one can see. Scars that made my worries about math tests or track performance pale in comparison to whether my science partner would live or whether my classmate's speech would be impaired by the shrapnel lodged in his skull. Today, those mental scars throb in large crowds and force me to scan the room for exits. They make my heart beat faster when I hear the blades of a helicopter overhead. Now, as a teacher in my eighth year in the classroom, I consider every day that I go to work a privilege. I cherish my students' joy and enthusiasm, and most importantly, their innocence. I believe that it is our job, as a society, to protect these virtues in our young people. I want them to be worried about math tests and track meets and about science fairs and student council elections -- the kind of normal school stuff that builds character. But our epidemic of gun violence is creating a culture of fear in our schools, where students are anxious about safety and intruders. These are worries no student should have. This becomes even more apparent when we conduct our monthly emergency drill at our school. It's a way to be prepared for the worst, so we practice lockdowns, fire drills and evacuations. The other day, I was explaining to my third graders that we were going to practice a lockdown just in case a bear happened to be on the playground -- a real scenario for our Colorado school. I have used this example my entire teaching career because it's an easy and nonthreatening reason to practice a lockdown. One girl raised her hand and asked: ""Is this what we would do if a bad guy came with a gun to hurt us?"" I felt kicked in the stomach when I heard this question. A bear is no longer the worst thing for students to anticipate: They fear what is happening across our nation. It is a shame that my students must learn these drills at such a young age -- a shame they must learn them at all. I thought to myself, ""This is a result of the Columbine shootings, along with so many other acts of violence. This is my reality, and now it is theirs too."" It is a sad reality, but we are not helpless. I teach at a wonderful school, which has done everything within its resources to keep our students safe. But it is not enough. If there were a simple solution, then this epidemic of violence would have ended. The solution is complex, multifaceted -- and achievable. I believe a comprehensive approach can help ensure a safe learning environment. â€¢ Our children deserve more mental health resources to identify, treat and follow up with people who need help. â€¢ Our children deserve enhanced school security: This includes identifying who is in the school and sensible steps to keep the building secure -- without bringing guns into the place of learning or turning it into a fortress. â€¢ Our children deserve common sense gun legislation: I believe this should include a ban on high-capacity magazine clips. And at the very least, it should include comprehensive and enforceable background checks to help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. Unfortunately, our Congress refused to take this common sense step and turned this legislation down. The shooters at my school obtained their guns illegally, through private sales and straw purchases. Today they could easily go online and buy those same weapons without a background check. What is to stop the next person who chooses from doing just that? We can do better. I think I can speak for all of us that the murders at Columbine High School, the Aurora movie theater, Sandy Hook Elementary, and so many others shocked us to our core and created lasting feelings of sadness. But we can't let these events create feelings of vulnerability. We have the power to work together to create a safer world for our students. Learn from my experience -- do not wait until you experience violence first hand to realize that we need to take action. We need to take action now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Katie Lyles.","Former Columbine student Katie Lyles bears hidden scars from the day of the massacre .

"(EW.com) -- I've lost count, but ""After Earth"" seems like it must be the fourth post-apocalyptic thriller this month. The movie teams Will Smith and his son, Jaden Smith, and it was directed by M. Night Shyamalan, the former maestro-huckster of the twist ending. But Shyamalan's star has fallen, and he has become a glorified gun for hire. The movie takes off from a concept as basic as a videogame, and it sticks to that concept, without surprise. In the dystopian future, the human race has been forced to abandon a toxic earth overrun by snappy-jawed monsters that look like they came out of a Starship Troopers sequel. Will Smith plays Cypher, a military Ranger famous for his total absence of fear (that's why he's invincible to the monsters, who stalk their prey by smelling fear), and Jaden plays his upstart Ranger-cadet son, Kitai, who is traveling with him on an interplanetary mission. When an asteroid storm forces the ship to crash-land on earth, Cypher is badly injured, and it's up to Kitai to travel a hundred kilometers on foot, all to retrieve a homing beacon. But his father, who can see what Kitai sees through a digital transmission, talks to him as if he were a videogame avatar, guiding the kid through his trek to manhood. We're not used to seeing Will Smith shorn of his lightness and humor, but in ""After Earth,"" he's solemn and heavy-lidded, and he speaks with grave deliberation, never even using contractions. He tries to make Cypher a kind of Obi-Wan figure, and Smith is charismatic enough to pull this off, but the father-son, mentor/disciple relationship is better than the rest of the film, which is like a plate of sci-fi leftovers. The knives have been out for Jaden Smith, who is routinely dismissed by blogosphere snark as a lucky-duck celebrity offspring whose dad will do anything to make him a star. I'm someone who thinks that Jaden Smith has a lot of talent; his moody melancholy held that ""Karate Kid"" remake together. But a movie like After Earth, in which he mostly has to act all by himself, taking orders from his father as he dodges post-apocalyptic clichÃ©s, isn't doing him any favors. Grade: C+ .

"(CNN) -- A Texas man died after a swarm of Africanized bees disturbed by his tractor attacked, stinging him more than 1,000 times Saturday. The bees were living inside an old chicken coop that Larry Goodwin, 62, was pushing over to clear off his Moody, Texas, property, neighbor John Puckett told CNN affiliate KCEN-TV. ""He lifted the whole hive and disturbed them all and they just came swarming out of there and trapped him on his tractor,"" Puckett said. His daughter and neighbors rushed to help, but they said there was nothing they could do to save Goodwin. ""When we got to him, he was purple, he had thousands and thousands of bee stings on his face and arms,"" Tanya Goodwin said. Puckett said his wife and daughter were stung 100 times. ""I came pretty close to losing my family,"" Puckett said. Allen Miller, whose company Bees Be Gone removed the hive after the attack, said he's seen more Africanized bee hives in the past few weeks than he normally sees in a year. ""If anybody has any brush or anything on their lands, please clear it, because they don't want to go through this,"" Tanya Goodwin said. ""Nobody needs to go through this."" Africanized honey bees, known colloquially as ""killer bees,"" are believed to have entered Texas in 1990 and have since spread to at least 10 other states, from California to Florida. Africanized honey bees, which are hybrids of African and European bees, can be highly defensive around their nests and swarm more frequently than other honey bees, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The venom carried by honey bees has similar potency.","Larry Goodwin, 62, was pushing over a chicken coop when the swarm attacked .

"Washington (CNN) -- A top-secret program that collects phone records of Americans is legal, conducted properly and possibly could have helped detect a 9/11 hijacker had it been in place before the 2001 terrorist attacks, FBI Director Robert Mueller said Thursday. Mueller's remarks at a House Judiciary Committee hearing led an effort by Obama administration officials and some in Congress to push back against a firestorm of criticism about domestic surveillance in the aftermath of classified leaks last week that disclosed details of covert surveillance programs. Civil liberties groups and legislators on the left and right are among critics condemning the secret programs under the National Security Agency as government overreach beyond the intention and limits of the Patriot Act originally passed in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. ""It's my fear that we are on the verge of becoming a surveillance state, collecting billions of electronic records on law-abiding Americans every single day,"" Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the judiciary panel, said Thursday. Claiming Section 215 of the Patriot Act ""is being used to engage in a nationwide dragnet of telecommunications records"" and that the government is relying too much to cover up what it's doing through classified programs, Conyers said he is co-sponsoring legislation that would address ""the overbreadth and impenetrability of the surveillance programs."" Two conservative Republicans, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas, announced plans for a lawsuit challenging whether a secret court order allowing the collection of phone records was constitutional. However, other legislators of both parties joined Mueller in defending the programs that were disclosed through leaks of classified information. ""This program does not target innocent Americans in any way, shape or form,"" said House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican. ""These programs have helped keep America safe. They have enhanced our ability to go after terrorists who want to bring harm to the American people."" Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida -- emerging from a classified briefing by officials on the programs on Thursday, including Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander -- said public perception of the government data mining was wrong. ""It is misunderstood that Americans' private information -- telephone calls and emails -- are being rummaged through by the government. That is not true,"" Nelson told reporters. ""Only when there is probable cause given with a court order by a federal judge can they go into the content of phone calls and emails in order to be able to disrupt a terrorist plot."" After an earlier briefing for the House Intelligence Committee, Chairman Mike Rogers of Michigan said it was wrong to describe the NSA programs as either monitoring or surveillance. ""Wrong word. Not happening,"" he said of either description. FBI chief: Programs in adherence with Constitution . One of the programs, under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, collects billions of phone records to create a database for use in tracking suspected terrorists. Another under Section 702 of the Patriot Act deals with computer activity and other information of foreigners. As explained by Mueller and other security officials, the phone records only show the numbers involved and the date and duration of the call. Any further information, such as what was said, requires federal court approval, they say. ""If you are going to connect the dots on a 9-11 style event or hopefully prevent a 9-11 style event, you have to have dots in the box in order to connect,"" Rogers said. ""So all of this is just that little bit of information they might need - a phone number to a phone number with no names attached."" Mueller told the Judiciary Committee that the secret programs have been conducted in adherence with the Constitution and federal laws. ""The legality has been ensured"" by the Department of Justice, and special federal courts set up to handle surveillance issues ""ruled and monitored these programs and again, ensured the legality,"" he said. He also explained how they might have helped detect 9/11 hijacker Khalid al-Mhidhar before he and others carried out the attacks that killed almost 3,000 Americans in 2001. Before the attacks, Mhidhar was being monitored by intelligence agencies in the Far East, but they lost track of him, Mueller said. Meanwhile, authorities had the phone number of an al Qaeda safehouse in Yemen, he said, and learned after the 9/11 attacks that Mhidhar had called it from San Diego. ""If we had this program, that opportunity would have been there"" to match the Yemen phone number to the San Diego number, he said. On Wednesday, Alexander made a similar argument at a Senate committee hearing, saying the covert programs helped prevent ""dozens"" of terrorist events. He was unable to provide details, but said Thursday he was working on declassifying further information about the programs' successes. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters she expected Alexander to have the additional information on Monday. Balancing boosting security, protecting privacy . Feinstein also called for legislation that would prevent government contractors such as 29-year-old Edward Snowden, who has admitted leaking the classified documents about the covert programs to the media, from having access to such sensitive information. While saying he couldn't say much about a person under investigation, White House spokesman Jay Carney did tell reporters Thursday that ""the leaks themselves were very serious."" ""They go right to the heart of our efforts to combat terrorism, to combat efforts by extremists who desire to attack the United States and the American people,"" Carney said. The White House spokesman also reiterated Obama's support for programs he says have ""helped thwart dozens of attacks."" ""He believes in the tradeoffs that we have to make to pursue our security and protect our privacy,"" Carney said of the president. ""We have found ... we have the right balance, but (Obama) understands others may have a different opinion. Like members of his national security team, the president has defended the Bush administration programs as necessary and claimed that there are more checks and balances on them than there were when he came to office in 2009. Under his administration, legislative and judicial oversight of the Patriot Act has been strengthened, Obama told reporters last week. Boehner, however, said Thursday that he was surprised the White House ""hasn't stood up and made clear on an ongoing basis over this last week just how important these programs are.""

"(CNN) -- Vice President Nicolas Maduro was sworn in Friday as acting president of Venezuela in a ceremony held in the National Assembly in Caracas, three days after the death of President Hugo Chavez. Asked if he swore to uphold the laws of the country and to follow the constitution, Maduro said, ""I swear."" Then, in a rambling speech that evoked the bombastic oratory of Chavez, Maduro said he would work to keep alive his memory and legacy. ""We still have him in our hearts,"" said Maduro, who was wearing a sash bearing the colors of the Venezuelan flag across his chest. ""I have him here, here, as if he was the name in my soul, because I am his son."" He continued, ""We are here to guarantee peace, safety and political stability and the lifting up of the poor in Venezuela will continue. Onward and upward with socialism!"" Maduro appealed to the opposition to field a presidential candidate for elections that are to be held in 30 days. ""Some of them are here today,"" he said. ""Welcome."" But he noted that few opposition members were in attendance. ""They didn't want to come,"" he said. About the elections, he said, ""May the best person win. The people will decide."" Maduro alluded to the United States, with whom Chavez had had prickly relations. ""Our eyes will see sooner rather than later the decline of the imperialist elites that changed the United States into an empire of aggression,"" he said. ""That moment will be a fabulous moment for humanity."" He announced that he had appointed the minister of science and technology, Jorge Arreaza, to replace him as vice president. Shortly before the ceremony, opposition leader and Miranda State Gov. Henrique Capriles told reporters in Caracas that the ceremony was ""an abuse of power."" ""To be president, the people have to elect you,"" he said. ""The constitution is very clear."" Capriles said Maduro would have to first register as a candidate and then campaign. ""That's what the constitution says,"" he said. ""It's all here."" Then, addressing Maduro as if he were there, he said, ""Nicolas, they didn't elect you. The people didn't vote for you, boy."" He continued, ""We are not going to permit that the sorrow that the people feel be an excuse for the abuse of power, for constitutional fraud."" Chavez's impact lauded at funeral . He called the ceremony ""an illegitimate swearing-in"" and blasted a high court decision declaring it legal. ""Gentlemen of the Supreme Court, you do not decide who is and who is not president,"" he said. ""The people decide ... The vice president takes charge, but not as interim president."" Asked whether he planned to run for president, Capriles demurred. ""We will talk again,"" he said. The opposition was arguing that Maduro should have served both as interim president, without being sworn in, and vice president, said Jennifer McCoy, director of the Americas Program at the Carter Center and professor of political science at Georgia State University. ""But now that he's named a vice president and has the presidential flag, we'll have to see what they do about participating in the election,"" she said. ""A constitution cannot specify every single scenario that could occur,"" she continued. ""That's part of the problem."" She predicted that Chavez's primary legacy would be the sense of inclusion that he gave to those sectors of the population that had not felt represented in the past. ""I think it's a very strong legacy and that they do feel like now they've got rights and that they will exercise those rights in the future."" But he also leaves a divided country, a move that was intentional, she said. ""He felt that change could only be accomplished through confrontation,"" she said. ""And that confrontation included excluding those who used to be in power."" The result has been a loss of much of the country's production capacity, both in the private sector and in the petroleum sector, where a number of workers and managers were fired after a strike in 2003, she said. Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based policy forum on Western Hemisphere affairs, predicted that a Maduro administration would find it tough to govern. ""Chavez had a unique ability to do that, and nobody else has either the political skill or the charisma to keep all the very disparate factions of chavismo together."" Still, Maduro and his supporters have great incentive to rise to the occasion. ""If they don't, they risk losing power, and they want to stay in power,"" he said. But even if he wins a six-year term as president, Maduro would not be on solid ground, given the country's profound economic and security problems, Shifter said. He cited inflation above 22%, massive debt, shortages of basic goods, routine electricity blackouts and widespread crime -- the 16,000 people killed in an average year is triple the number who were killed the year Chavez entered office. ""The fundamental problem is that the government has just spent much more money than they had."" Shifter also predicted that a Maduro administration would not maintain warm relations with the United States. Neither country has posted an ambassador in the other country since 2008. ""Maduro has to be very careful about the base of his party and following Chavez's policy toward the United States, which has been one of a lot of confrontation and aggression."" Still, he noted, Maduro is a former union official, not the paratrooper military officer that Chavez was. ""So, he's somebody who has negotiated deals. I think he'd be open to at least having communication with the United States.""

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Tiger Woods lamented a ""rough day"" after equaling the second-worst score of his professional career on Saturday. The American carded a seven-over-par 79 as he posted a triple bogey and two doubles in his opening nine holes at the Memorial Tournament, to be 16 shots off the lead as he struggled in the windy conditions. ""It was a rough day,"" the defending champion told the PGA Tour website. ""It was tough out there from beginning to end."" Woods had seemed in good shape to end his five-year wait for a 15th major title at this month's U.S. Open, with four wins already in 2013, but his form at Muirfield Village in Ohio has been his worst this season -- carding 71 and 74 in the opening round of a tournament he has won five times. ""It's just one of those things where I'm sure I'm not the only one who struggled out there,"" said Woods, playing his first tournament since his public spat with Sergio Garcia -- who was accused of a racist remark after saying he would serve Tiger ""fried chicken"" in response to a question about their argument at last month's Players Championship . ""The conditions were tough -- when I missed it cost me,"" Woods added. ""I caught the wrong gusts at the wrong time, made a couple bad swings and all in all it just went the wrong way."" Starting on the back nine, Woods posted 44 by the turn -- his worst effort on the PGA Tour. He hit back with three birdies but then dropped two more shots, including a bogey at the last hole. ""We didn't hit that many bad shots starting out the day and the next thing you know we are quite a few over par,"" he said. ""It was a tough day. I tried to fight back on the back nine, just didn't quite materialize."" World No. 2 Rory McIlroy also struggled in the third round, undoing his good work having earlier completed a weather-delayed 69 that meant he made the halfway cut. The Northern Irishman carded 75 -- three better than his opening 78 -- as he ended the day tied for 64th, two shots ahead of Woods but 14 behind leader Matt Kuchar. Kuchar posted his second successive round of 70 to claim a two-shot lead from fellow Americans Kevin Chappell (68) and Kyle Stanley (73). Kuchar is in form after finishing second at last week's Crowne Plaza Invitational, while he won the World Golf Championships-Accenture Match Play Championship in February. Halfway leader Bill Haas dropped to a tie for fourth with Matt Jones and 2010 Memorial winner Justin Rose of England after slumping to 76. Meanwhile, Matteo Manassero stayed in contention for a second successive European Tour title despite faltering at the Stockholm Masters on Saturday. The 20-year-old Italian, who last week became the youngest winner of the tour's flagship PGA Championship, carded one-under 71 to be tied for third in Sweden -- four shots behind leader Mikko Illonen of Finland.","Tiger Woods struggles with seven-over-par 79 at PGA Tour's Memorial Tournament .

"Kingston, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Two weeks ago, a growth was found on the chest of Sara Polcari's 6-year-old dog, Charlie. Given Charlie's history with cancer -- he had one of his hind legs amputated in March to get rid of a tumor -- the veterinarian recommended immediate surgery. The timing couldn't have been worse. Polcari had just been laid off from her job, and now she and her husband were looking at an $850 bill. She was also six months pregnant. ""It's like, 'What are we going to do? Now? Really? Of all times?' "" Polcari said. ""It's really tough to meet our bills and to have this large amount of cost for Charlie coming up, it was just really unexpected."" The Polcaris had been able to pay for Charlie's amputation by raising money through family and friends. But now, they didn't know what to do. That's when the vet told them about Fairy DogParents, a nonprofit that helps dog owners pay for their pets' needs during times of economic hardship. ""We filled out the online application, and I got a phone call that night saying that they would love to help,"" Sara Polcari said. Since it started in 2009, Fairy DogParents has provided aid for nearly 400 dogs in Massachusetts: $150,000 worth of dog food and medical care. ""It's to prevent dogs from being surrendered to shelters or euthanized when their owners cannot afford care,"" said Marlo Manning, who founded Fairy DogParents. ""Financial hardship is a very common reason why people surrender their animals to a shelter. And once they do that, it's not a choice that you can undo."" Between 2 million and 2.5 million dogs enter U.S. shelters each year, and between 1 million and 2 million of those are euthanized, according to estimates from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The ASPCA also says that as many as 1 million pets in America are at risk of becoming homeless because of the recent economic downturn. ""I've never had to choose between caring for my dogs or caring for myself,"" said Manning, 39. ""Most of the people we help, they're doing their best to get back on track. And then a crisis happens with their dog. And it's just one more thing that they can't afford. ... ""It's emotionally taxing on them because they think, 'If I can't even take care of this dog, what right do I have to have it?' So we want to take that burden away and say: 'You do have a right to have it. Get through this, and we'll help you.' And through that, we give them a little ray of hope."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . Manning knows how much an ailing dog can cost. She and her husband adopted their first dog, Ladybug, from a shelter in 2005, when Ladybug was 10 years old. In the four years she spent with the couple, the pooch developed a host of health issues, including vertigo, dementia and ultimately cancer. Over time, the costs for Ladybug's medicine, vet bills and special food averaged about $300 to $400 a month, Manning said. ""Having gone through a job loss myself, I thought: 'I'm really glad that we had Ladybug when we did, because we were able to afford it. If it had happened at a different point in time, I don't know what we would've done. We couldn't have given up on her. She'd never give up on us.' "" After Ladybug died, Manning still had hundreds of dollars' worth of pet medications and prescription food. With the veterinarian's help, she donated them to another dog owner in need. But she was left wanting to do more. When Manning went to retrieve Ladybug's ashes from the veterinarian's office, she asked the staff whether they knew of a way to sponsor the dog of a family less fortunate. They did not, but they directed her to a local newspaper article that discussed the growing need. ""(On) the cover of the local paper was a story about dogs being tied to the front of shelters because people couldn't afford to keep them anymore. They couldn't afford to feed them, never mind get them medicine,"" Manning recalled. ""With Ladybug, her remains by my side ... within seconds, I melted into a puddle and couldn't stop crying. I said, 'I have to do something.' "" When Manning founded Fairy DogParents, her goal was to help three families in her first year. She exceeded that expectation by 24. ""I had such a hole in my heart; I had to fill it,"" Manning said. ""And I couldn't fill it by running out and getting another dog. I chose to find a way to sponsor other people who could not afford to keep their dog. ""Because (Ladybug) came from a shelter, it had two meanings for me. One was to keep her memory alive. And the other was to keep another dog from going to a shelter since that system is already stressed enough as it is."" Dog owners can apply online for financial help, which is all funded by private donations. The nonprofit is able to subsidize up to $800 a year for a dog's acute or chronic care and $300 a year for general wellness needs. For dogs who have needs exceeding those limits, the group has also hosted online fundraisers. ""The money is given directly to the vet or pharmacy,"" Manning said. ""And the dog owner is responsible for at least 15% of the cost."" Dogs must also be spayed or neutered to receive help. The average applicant makes a maximum of $2,000 a month before taxes. The group prioritizes the elderly, people with disabilities and people whose unemployment benefits have expired. ""A lot of the people that we sponsor ... have already lost so much that the one thing they try to hang on to is their dog,"" Manning said. ""A lot of them have lost their jobs. They've lost their homes. Some have even lost their significant other or their loved ones. And the dog, to them, is some sort of normal or a tie to a happier time. And they don't want to have to make that devastating decision."" Oftentimes, families who turn to Manning's group are facing life-and-death scenarios related to their dogs. Manning says 75% of the grants her group has awarded have paid for emergency treatment that spared the dogs from being euthanized. ""We're just completely surprised that they were just able to help us out with the full (sponsorship) amount,"" Polcari said of the assistance her family received. ""It was just such a blessing, and we'll be forever grateful that Charlie gets this second chance."" For Manning, who also has a full-time job at a market research firm, being able to provide those second chances is a tribute to Ladybug's memory. ""Every picture you see of a dog we've helped, every story that we tell, it's a happy ending. This dog is with its family and never had to go into a shelter,"" Manning said, beaming. ""It's living happily ever after at home. And that's why we're called the Fairy DogParents, because much like (in) Cinderella, we're in the background. The dog doesn't even know we exist, and we're just making sure it gets to the ball."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Speaking is profoundly human: More of the human brain is devoted to speech than any other activity. People can have an IQ of 50, or a brain that is only one-third the normal size and have difficulties with many simple tasks, but they can speak. Humans are so tuned to words that from about the age of 18 months, children learn about eight to 10 new words a day, a rate that continues until adolescence. Humans love to speak: When two hearing people encounter each other, they will speak, despite having other means of communication such as gesturing or drawing. Even when people speak different languages or come from different cultures, they will try to find common words and phrases. One-day-old infants can distinguish speech from any other sounds and 4-day-olds can distinguish between their native language and other languages. Even in the womb, a fetus can distinguish her or his mother's voice from all other female voices. Adults can distinguish speech sounds at twice the rate of any other sounds, aided by special hair cells in the outer right ear. See also: Florida anthropologist explains 'baby talk' origins . Among all animals, only humans have the necessary breathing apparatus and musculature to be able to speak: despite the ""Planet of the Apes,"" no primate could speak like a person, even if their brains grew. Even human ancestors such as the Neanderthal could not possibly speak: speech is a new and remarkably impressive ability. So, there is nothing so human as speech -- at least until modern technologies came along. Through striking advances in a computer's ability to understand and produce speech, it is common to use your telephone to make airline reservations, answer questions and search the Web. Because of the shrinking size and increasing speed of computers, it is also possible to speak directly to your automobile. From putting up with the car intoning, ""Your door is ajar,"" we have moved to navigation systems that can tell you where to find a latte and car interfaces that understand spoken commands and even allow drivers to dictate e-mails, texts and make phone calls. What could be more simple and natural than talking, even to a technology? And speaking to cars seems particularly desirable. We don't have to take our eyes from the road or our hands from the wheel to select buttons or make choices: Why not let our mouths and our ears do all the work? Unfortunately, it's not so simple or so desirable. Recent research by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, conducted by David Strayer at the University of Utah, finds that the new technology can be so distracting it impairs the ability to drive. Studies found that while driving, our attention becomes overloaded by speaking. It basically takes our minds, if not our eyes, off the road. Here are three reasons why talking while driving is so distracting, and not as safe and effective as you might think: . People like to picture who they are talking with. When you speak with someone face-to-face, you ""hear lips and see voices"": Your brain automatically and easily focuses on the person. When you speak on the telephone, you use brainpower to create a mental image of the person you are talking with: The less you know the person, the more mental workload it takes. When you talk to a car, use a phone in a car or dictate a text message, your brain has to do a great deal of work to picture with whom you are communicating. When you're thinking that hard, it's very difficult to pay attention to the road. That's why talking on a cell phone -- hands free or not -- is much more dangerous than talking to a passenger. The need to imagine steals from attention to the road. See also: Is hands-free driving just as dangerous? People want to be understood. Although people love to speak, there are few more frustrating things than someone not listening. Listeners puts a great deal of energy into showing that they are listening: They nod their head, say ""uh huh,"" open their eyes and change their posture. People are built to expect these signals of attention, but cars refuse to provide them. As a result, drivers become overly concerned with whether the car understands or is even listening, and their attention is again drawn away from the road. In addition, the voice of the car does not have the rich vocal cues that indicate engagement and emotion, providing further evidence that the car isn't understanding. Cars are not native speakers. When you encounter someone who isn't facile in your language, you have to put a great deal of time into selecting the right words, avoiding idioms and speaking slowly and clearly. Speech is no longer an easy and natural means of communication in these instances. While it is remarkable that cars can understand something that took billions of years of human evolution, the typical car recognition rate of 85% to 95% makes it a mediocre second-language speaker. As a result, speech becomes effortful and demanding, stealing attention from the road. Because of these problems, my laboratory and laboratories around the world are trying to find ways to support the driver in creating mental images, in showing that the car wants to understand and enabling the car to understand at levels equal to or even better than a person. And soon cars will be driving themselves, so that people can ignore the road and multitask their way to fighting for attention from each other, just as they do outside the car.

"(CNN) -- I turned 18 years old a week before Election Day in 1982 and was excited to exercise my newly earned right to vote. The first ballot I ever cast was for United States Senate. The race pitted a popular veteran Congresswoman against a political neophyte businessman who was the decided underdog. The underdog won. His name was Frank Lautenberg. Sen. Lautenberg went on to win two more rough-and-tumble races before retiring. However, he jumped at the chance to return to Washington in 2002, when incumbent Bob Torricelli, dragged down by ethics allegations, announced that he wanted to withdraw less than two months before the election. In a move that became known as ""the switcheroo,"" Democrats were allowed to put Lautenberg's name on the ballot instead. He then coasted to a double digit win and did the same in 2008. Lautenberg was unabashedly liberal on social issues such as abortion, the environment, and gun control. His major legislative legacy, though, centers on transportation issues. He was a strong supporter of improving the country's mass transit infrastructure including funding Amtrak. Memories of his father's early death attributed to unhealthy working conditions, though, kept Lautenberg fighting on the environmental front. In fact, he used transportation-related legislation to further his larger health and safety agenda. This included a smoking ban on airplanes, which was the first widespread limitation on using tobacco in public. He also created a de facto national drinking age by reducing federal highway funds for states whose minimum age was lower than 21. What I will remember most about Lautenberg is that he always stood his ground. He was never shy about telling you why he was right and the other guy was wrong. A Lautenberg opponent once described him as a ""swamp dog."" While the senator initially bristled at the characterization, he took pride in having a street-fighter's reputation. Some observers thought that the octogenarian met his match in 2010. That was when recently-elected New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- hardly a shrinking violet himself -- cancelled plans to build a new train tunnel under the Hudson River to New York City. Lautenberg came out swinging, calling Christie's decision one of ""the biggest public policy blunders in New Jersey's history."" The feud escalated, but Lautenberg would not back down. The two didn't really patch things up until they worked together to get federal aid for Hurricane Sandy recovery. Lautenberg leaves tricky political question for Christie . Chris Christie now has the opportunity to appoint a replacement for Lautenberg. He is faced with the decision of either appointing a caretaker or giving an ally the ability to run as a sitting senator, while also clearing other Republicans from the field. Coincidentally, the last time a New Jersey governor was faced with this decision was 1982, after a Democratic senator had resigned. At the time, New Jersey Republicans hadn't won a U.S. Senate seat in nearly 10 years. But Ronald Reagan had won the state by 13 points two years earlier and this was seen as a prime opportunity for the GOP. Republican Gov. Tom Kean, who had won the closest gubernatorial election in state history only a few months before, opted to appoint a placeholder as a gesture of goodwill. As a result, it was Lautenberg who was able to squeeze out a come-from-behind 4-point win over Congresswoman Millicent Fenwick. Christie is now faced with a similar prospect -- except that now the New Jersey GOP hasn't claimed a U.S. Senate win in more than 40 years. New Jersey law has two conflicting statutes on whether a special election has to be held this year or can wait until 2014. This could well end up in court. If the election is held this year, whoever runs as the GOP standard-bearer for the remainder of the term could appear on the same ballot as the extremely popular Chris Christie. Considering the coattails potential of his almost certain re-election bid, there is no better time for Republicans to take this seat. If they win now, they will have a voter-tested incumbent running for a full term in 2014. Of course, a contested senate race could bring out Democratic voters who were apathetic about the governor's race. This could cut into Christie's winning margin, which he hopes will be large enough to use as a selling point in a 2016 presidential run. The risk is particularly high if the Democrats field a well-known and well-funded challenger like Newark Mayor Cory Booker. Booker has been working to establish himself as the heir-apparent for 2014 -- which Lautenberg did not appreciate. A special election this year, though, may entice some of New Jersey's sitting congressmen to make a run without having to give up their House seats. So it could be a crowded field. Christie can also call a special election for the senate seat before the gubernatorial election in November. This could be a free-for-all with many Democrats and Republicans getting into the fray, although Democrats would have a greater chance of holding onto the seat in this scenario. None of the possible contenders, though, can claim the pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps, Greatest Generation personal story that shaped Frank Lautenberg's years of public service. Regardless of who fills the seat, one thing is clear: We will not see another ""swamp dog"" in the U.S. Senate. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Patrick Murray.","Patrick Murray: First time he voted was in 1982 election; underdog Frank Lautenberg won .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked a lawsuit challenging the federal government's sweeping electronic eavesdropping on suspected foreign terrorists and spies. The case put personal liberty at odds with national security, making it one of the most important rulings of the high court's term. The 5-4 conservative majority concluded the plaintiffs -- which included attorneys and journalists -- lacked ""standing"" or jurisdiction to proceed, without proof that suspects have been eavesdropped upon. The super secret National Security Agency has in turn refused to disclose specifics, which detractors call ""Catch-22"" logic. Justice Samuel Alito said plaintiffs ""cannot demonstrate that the future injury they purportedly fear is certainly impending."" The justices did not address the larger questions of the program's constitutionality, and this ruling will make it harder for future lawsuits to proceed. At issue: Can these American plaintiffs who deal with overseas clients and co-workers file suit if they reasonably suspect -- but cannot know for sure -- that the government was reading and hearing their sensitive communications? The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was revised by Congress in 2008 to give the attorney general and the director of national intelligence greater authority to order ""mass acquisition"" of electronic traffic from suspected foreign terrorists or spies. The law previously required the government to justify a national security interest before any monitoring of phone calls and e-mails originating in another country. A federal judge had to sign any search warrant. The larger issue involves the constitutionality of the federal government's electronic monitoring of targeted foreigners. A federal appeals court in New York ruled against the Obama administration, prompting the current appeal. After such ""warrantless wiretapping"" was exposed, President George W. Bush and his congressional allies moved to amend the existing law, which supporters say is designed to target only foreigners living outside the United States. Alito said that there were enough legal safeguards to ensure that any information gathered by the NSA would be used properly in court, and that a judicial FISA panel could review any particular surveillance. ""If the government were to prosecute one of the (plaintiffs') foreign clients using authorized surveillance, the government would be required to make a disclosure,"" Alito said. He was supported by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. In dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer said the harm claimed by the plaintiffs ""is not speculative. Indeed it is as likely to take place as are most future events that commonsense inference and ordinary knowledge of human nature tell us will happen."" He was backed by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and Amnesty International told the court that little is known about the FISA Amendments Act, such as who has been targeted, how often it has been used and whether any problems or abuses have occurred. A key point of contention was whether those amendments would stifle free speech of the work of lawyers, journalists and activists by forcing them to do their jobs less diligently, for fear of being monitored and perhaps prosecuted. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, speaking for the Justice Department, said that to the contrary, if the lawyer ""took precautions, it would be because of a belief that (he or she) had to comply with an ethics rule, and the ethics rule would be the cause of (him or her) taking those precautions."" Either way, he said, there was no ""concrete application"" of the law permitting someone to come into court and make a claim based on ""speculation."" The case is Clapper v. Amnesty International USA (11-1025).","In dissent, justice says the harm claimed by plaintiffs ""is not speculative""

"(CNN) -- Egypt's highest court Sunday invalidated the nation's upper house of parliament and a panel that drew up the constitution, state media reported. The upper house, or Shura Council, holds legislative powers. It will be dissolved after a new lower house is elected, state-run Ahram reported. The court dissolved the lower house of parliament last year, paving the way for the council to take over legislative powers pending a new parliament. Last year, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy issued an order preventing any court from overturning his decisions, essentially allowing him to run the country unchecked until a new constitution is drafted. A flurry of protests pitting his supporters against opponents forced him to cancel most of the controversial decree that gave him sweeping powers. The constitution was drafted by an Islamist-dominated assembly in November and approved by voters in December. Morsy signed a decree shortly after, putting into effect his country's newly approved constitution.","The upper house, or Shura Council, holds legislative powers .

"(CNN) -- When Arnold Palmer drove up Magnolia Lane on the eve of the 1962 Masters, he was in a confident mood. He'd already won it twice, as well as the U.S. and British Opens, but this was to be his ""Annus Mirabilis"" -- the year he cemented his reputation as a global sporting superstar. ""I was having some of my best times on the golf course,"" he told CNN, in trademark understated fashion, ahead of this week's Masters. ""I felt confident about myself and the way I was playing, and it worked out very well."" As the first major tournament of the golf year, the Masters is a springboard to some of the most magical moments in the sport's history. Victory at the prestigious and highly exclusive Augusta National Golf Club would be a career highlight for most players, but for a select few it is often just one jewel in an era-defining crown. Palmer had been determined to erase memories of the 1961 Masters, where he double-bogeyed the final hole to hand victory to South African rival Gary Player, the first international golfer to claim the coveted Green Jacket. The following year Palmer led going into the final round, but needed two late birdies to go into a playoff with Dow Finsterwald and Player -- ""two of my very best friends in golf."" He started badly in the 18-hole contest on Monday but staged a remarkable late surge. Fifty years on, Palmer's memories of his eventual triumph are still sharp. ""I had a pretty good back nine, that was the reason for my victory."" For ""pretty good"" read ""stunning"" -- Palmer conjured up birdies at 10, 12, 13, 14 and 16 for a 68 to better Player by three shots and don the famous Green Jacket for the third time -- he would again wear it in 1964. Palmer's caddy, Nathaniel ""Iron Man"" Avery, summed it up perfectly. ""He just jerks at his glove, tugs at his trouser belt and starts walking fast,"" he told reporters after the round. ""When Mr. Arnold does that, everybody better watch out. He's going to stampede anything in his way."" That year Palmer went on to claim his second British Open title at Royal Troon -- ""certainly one of my best Opens"" -- as he finished 12 under par on the seaside links to win by six from Kel Nagle. His only setback came at the U.S. Open at Oakmont, in his home state of Pennsylvania, despite going into the tournament as a heavy favorite. An eventual loss in an 18-hole play off to the 22-year-old Jack Nicklaus was ""very disappointing,"" said Palmer -- who three-putted 10 times in five days to undermine his fine play from tee to green. But victories in six other PGA Tour events, as well as winning the Vardon Trophy (named after the famous English golfer Harry Vardon) for the U.S. circuit's low scoring average, rounded off an incredible year. Golf's greatest years . By dominating golf as he did that season, Palmer continued a trend started by Vardon in the first year of the 20th century -- following in the footsteps of golf legends such as Bobby Jones and blazing a trail for the likes of Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. Vardon, known as ""Mr. Golf,"" set the ball rolling. Born in the British isle of Jersey, he left an indelible mark on the game by inventing the Vardon Grip -- the overlapping of the small finger over the other when holding a club -- which is used by the majority of the top players in the world today. In 1900 he crossed the Atlantic and became the first player to win both the U.S. Open and the British Open. Overall, he captured a record six majors in his homeland. In 1920, at the age of 50 and having suffered from tuberculosis, he still managed second place in the U.S. Open -- a true measure of his greatness. Paving the way for professionals . That decade, another golfing superstar emerged in the form of Walter Hagen, who like Palmer helped to popularize the sport with his attacking play and flamboyant lifestyle. The American was the first golfer to win $1 million in his career, claiming 11 major titles plus five victories at the Western Open -- which in his era was one of golf's leading events. In 1924, Hagen was at the peak of his powers and won the British Open as well as the U.S. PGA Championship (then a matchplay tournament). He also won three other PGA Tour events plus the Belgian Open. While Hagen helped the acceptance of professional players in a sport that had been mainly amateur, in 1930 another man became a worldwide name despite refusing to accept a cent for his many triumphs. Father of the Masters . When the world's elite play at Augusta this week, they owe their participation to the foresight and vision of Bobby Jones, who co-designed the course with Alister MacKenzie and co-founded the Masters Tournament with Clifford Roberts. Competing on an equal footing with Hagen and the top professionals, Jones had already won three U.S. Opens and two British Opens plus four U.S. Amateur crowns. But his feats of 1930 will surely remain unmatched. He claimed his own grand slam of the two pro and two unpaid majors on both sides of the Atlantic before promptly retiring at the tender age of 28 to practice law at the Georgia bar. Lord Byron . The Second World War brought an end to international competition, but that era saw the emergence of one of Palmer's heroes -- the great Byron Nelson. ""I watched him and admired him very much. He was one of the greatest players of all time,"" Palmer told CNN as he recalled the Texan's feats. Nelson's greatest year was 1945, near the end of the war, when he set a record on the PGA Tour which will surely remain unbroken. The Texan won 11 successive tournaments, beating the likes of Ben Hogan and Sam Snead. His 18 victories out of 35 starts included the PGA championship, and his scoring average of 68.33 stood until it was broken by Woods in 2000. Nelson retired the following year aged 34 to become a rancher but was the host of a PGA event which bore his name until his death in 2006. Hogan the hero . As the U.S. economy started booming in the post-war years, golf's profile was further boosted by the exploits of a player who bounced back from life-threatening adversity. Ben Hogan took determination and will to win to new levels in 1953 when he won all three majors he was able to contest, and five of six tournaments overall. Badly injured in a car crash in 1949 which nearly claimed his life, Hogan had to limit his schedule to prevent strain on his body. H won the Masters by five shots and was six clear in the U.S. Open at Oakmont, while he conquered the field at Carnoustie in the British Open by four strokes to be the only man under par on the tough Scottish links. Hogan was unable to play in the PGA Championships because it overlapped the British Open, but he would have chosen not to compete because he was unable to cope with the 36 holes per day expected of the players in the match play format. The ""Golden Bear"" A decade after Palmer's great year, one of his arch-rivals bestrode the game like a giant. Nicklaus, who had denied Palmer victory at the 1962 U.S. Open, was at the peak of his powers. ""It was easy to see that Jack would become a great player,"" said Palmer. Nicklaus won two majors in 1972, the Masters and the U.S. Open, and was second to Lee Trevino at the British Open. Seven victories came on the PGA Tour and, like Palmer in '62, he won the money list and the Vardon Trophy. Nicklaus would eventually set an all-time record of 18 majors, the final triumph coming at the Masters in 1986 with a famous final-round charge. Champions duel . The ""Golden Bear"" would next be challenged by Tom Watson, nine years his junior. Watson's win in their famous '""duel in the sun'""at Turnberry in 1977 will go down in golf history, but five years later his emergence was complete. Watson denied Nicklaus victory again at the 1982 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach with a miracle chip from the rough on the short 17th hole. The pair were tied for the lead with Watson looking certain to drop a shot when his effort hit the flag and went in for the most unlikely of birdies. It helped seal a two-shot victory, which the American followed up by winning his fourth British Open title at Troon before being named the PGA Tour's Player of the Year for the fifth of six times overall. Ice-cool Englishman . The balance of power in world golf shifted away from the United States in the 1990s, with England's Nick Faldo taking over as the No.1 as the decade started. With an attention to detail and competitive edge modeled on Hogan, Faldo claimed the Masters for the second time in 1990 after a playoff with Raymond Floyd. At the home of golf St. Andrews, he dominated the British Open from the start to win by five shots with a record 18-under aggregate. Faldo also finished tied for third, one shot back, in the U.S. Open at Medinah and was named golfer of the year on both sides of the Atlantic. Tiger on the prowl . However, golf had to wait another decade before the astonishing feats of a player who has become one of the most recognizable athletes on the planet, and certainly one of the richest. Tiger Woods could manage only fifth place at the 2000 Masters at Augusta, but it was to prove just about his only disappointment in a record-breaking year. His 15-stroke victory in the U.S Open at Pebble Beach was ""the greatest performance in golf history"" according Sports Illustrated magazine. The American broke Faldo's British Open record with an eight-shot win at St. Andrews and made it three majors for the year by beating Bob May in a playoff at the PGA Championship. Woods won nine of 20 PGA Tour events that year, with the lowest scoring average in history. He then won the 2001 Masters to hold all four of golf's major titles -- the first player to do so in the modern era. Palmer believes the 36-year-old, who won his invitational tournament at Bay Hill last month to end a PGA Tour title drought dating back to 2009, ""can return to his best"" in 2012. The world of golf is waiting to see.","50 years since legendary Arnold Palmer claimed his third U.S. Masters triumph .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- More than 340 fetuses have been found at a Buddhist temple in Bangkok, discovered because the smell of decay drew complaints, police said Wednesday. Discovery of the fetuses, which came from illegal abortion clinics, have led to six morticians being detained for questioning, police Lt. Col. Chusak Kumsai said. The chief of morticians admitted receiving fetuses from several clinics, Kumsai said. Temples in Thailand typically have morticians who prepare bodies for cremation. The fetuses have been taken from the Phai-nguern Chotinaram temple in central Bangkok to the Chulongkorn Forensic Institute for investigation, police said. ""I think [the fetuses were at the temple] because the new incinerators are under construction,"" nearby resident Puak Eiamchan said. ""So the temple can't receive any dead bodies to cremate for almost two months now."" ""I believe that people who did this must have done it for some time and it was exposed because they can't burn the fetuses and they were accumulated to hundreds and the smell started to tell."" Abortion is illegal in Thailand, but women are allowed to one if they are the victims of rape, or if the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother, according to Pavena Hongskul, founder of the Pavena Foundation for Children and Women.","The smell of decay leads to the discovery .

"(CNN) -- Tornado watches stretched from the Texas Panhandle to central Nebraska on Wednesday as another wave of storms put portions of the Plains states and Midwest squarely in the bull's-eye again. It was the latest round of severe weather to settle over America's heartland as warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico saturated the area, bringing with it the risk of twisters, large hail and damaging winds. Though radar indications triggered sporadic warnings for a handful of counties in Texas, Kansas and Nebraska, no tornadoes or damage had been reported by Wednesday evening. However, a severe thunderstorm warning posted for the Kearney, Nebraska, area said golf ball-sized hail that could damage vehicles, roofs and crops was possible as the storm swept northward. In Macksville, Kansas, about 100 miles west of Wichita, residents reported wind gusts up to 80 mph, the National Weather Service said. The watches also covered most of western Oklahoma and Oklahoma City and its suburbs. One of those, Moore, was hit May 20 by a top-scale, mile-wide tornado that killed 24 people. The weather service issued a severe thunderstorm warning for the area Wednesday evening, saying hail and wind gusts up to 70 mph were possible. The threat covers more than half the country, stretching from the Canadian border to the Gulf coast and from the Eastern Seaboard to the Intermountain West. This will most likely occur in the form of severe thunderstorms, though the forecast notes there's also a greater probability than usual of large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes. Opinion: Tornado risk goes beyond the 'Alley' The powerful storms have been dumping heavy rain across the region, especially on portions of Kansas, Missouri, South Dakota, Illinois and Indiana, where flood warnings were in place, the Weather Service said. Multiple tornadoes were spotted across Kansas on Tuesday evening. One touched down near the north-central town of Corning, striking six farms, one of which was destroyed, according to Nemaha County emergency manager Todd Swart. But there were no reports of injuries or deaths: ""I imagine there are some dead hogs,"" Swart said. Justin Strathman saw the twister first-hand, catching the video on his cell phone. ""It was amazing,"" he told CNN affiliate KSHB. ""It was scary. I ain't gonna lie."" A tornado's heading your way: Now what?

"(CNN) -- A judge's ruling Thursday makes another child waiting for a lung transplant in Philadelphia more quickly eligible for adult lungs. The family of Javier Acosta, 11, asked a federal judge to issue a restraining order to block a policy that keeps children younger than 12 from being prioritized for available adult lung transplants. Judge Michael Baylson granted a temporary injunction and ordered U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to direct the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to waive the rule in Javier's case. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for June 14. The ruling comes a day the same judge granted an injunction for 10-year-old Sarah Murnaghan, whose parents' push for an organ transplant policy change has thrust the issue of who gets donated organs into the national spotlight. Her family has argued that because the number of children's lungs available through organ donation programs is so small, Sarah -- and other pediatric patients like her -- should be added to the list of people waiting for adult lungs, prioritized by severity of their illnesses. In a suit filed on behalf of Acosta's mother on Thursday, attorney Stephen Harvey said the argument in Javier's case was equally compelling. The 11-year-old is ""severely ill"" and in intensive care at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the lawsuit says. ""Javier needs a lung transplant to survive. Without one he will most likely die before his 12th birthday in August,"" Harvey wrote. ""He could die sooner, much sooner, if his conditions were to suddenly deteriorate."" According to the United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS, five children received lung transplants in the first three months of the year and 72 were on the waiting list. Murnaghan's father, Fran, told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360Ëš"" on Wednesday that his daughter, who has cystic fibrosis, has declined slightly in the past two days. ""But we're very excited with the news today, that she will have the opportunity to be equally judged and have the opportunity to receive lungs,"" he said. The Philadelphia girl has been waiting 18 months for another pair of lungs as her ability to breathe has rapidly deteriorated. Adult lungs are far more available than lungs from children, and doctors have said they believe modified adult lungs might save the girl's life. Earlier this week, the Murnaghans asked Sebelius to change the rules. She has previously told the family that she doesn't have the authority to intervene in a particular case, but she also called for the policy review. Any change could take up to two years. In a letter to Sibelius Thursday, UNOS said the executive committee of its Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network will be reviewing the policy Monday and would be able approve an interim policy change if officials decide it's warranted. Dying girl's plight sparks fight over organ transplants .

"HATTIESBURG, Mississippi (CNN)  -- Thousands gathered Saturday for the funeral of former NFL quarterback Steve McNair, who was killed a week ago. Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis arrives for Saturday's funeral service. ""Steve was like a hero to me and heroes are not supposed to die,"" Tennessee Titans quarterback Vince Young told the crowd, his voice cracking. ""He inspired me,"" Young said of his longtime mentor. ""He has helped me on every decision I have made."" McNair's casket -- sitting front and center at the University of Southern Mississippi's Reed Green Coliseum -- was draped with flowers. Adjacent to it was a large photograph of the slain quarterback, one of many. A floral wreath framed a No. 9 jersey. Among those in the audience were former NFL quarterback Brett Favre, Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis and Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler. Mississippi's Oak Grove High School football team, for which Steve McNair Jr. plays, was also there, dressed in their game jerseys. ""We are here to celebrate a king,"" Lewis told the crowd.

The young woman then sat on the couch next to his body and killed herself so that she would fall into his lap, police said. McNair spent 13 seasons in the NFL, mostly with the Tennessee Titans, where he excelled on the field as quarterback. He was named the NFL's co-MVP in 2003 and spent his last two seasons with the Baltimore Ravens before announcing his retirement in April 2008.","Funeral held at University of Southern Mississippi's Reed Green Coliseum .

"(CNN) -- ""Take our country back."" Almost as soon as Barack Obama became president four years ago, we began hearing that phrase, as if black folks had stolen the White House. Each time I see one of those ""Take Our Country Back"" signs on someone's lawn, I want to knock on the door and ask, ""from whom?"" From whom are you trying to take this country back? But I don't, because I already know the answer. It's the same answer to the question of why so many people still don't believe that President Obama was born in the United States. Or why they continue to question his faith or why Donald Trump feels comfortable insulting the office by promising his pocket change in exchange for Obama's college transcripts, as if the president is a stripper desperate for singles. He and his kind are so pathetic. They don't just disagree with him. They disrespect him, because in their minds, he's not supposed to be there. He got a handout. He's not a real American. Something about him ain't ... quite ... right. Opinion: Obama's victory won't transform America . So when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, his critics spent more time discrediting the importance of the award than congratulating him for winning it. When unemployment fell under 8%, they accused the Obama administration of fixing the numbers. When the president opted to campaign instead of surveying the damage caused by Hurricane Isaac sooner, he was called selfish. When Obama left the campaign trail to survey the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy, former FEMA Director Michael Brown criticized him for responding too quickly. Nothing he did was good enough for them. But on Tuesday, it was good enough for the majority of real Americans. We watched then-congressman Pete Hoekstra call the stimulus package a failure and then show up for a groundbreaking ceremony for a manufacturing plant made possible by the stimulus. We saw Texas Gov. Rick Perry call the stimulus a waste during debates while quietly using stimulus money to balance his state's budget. Rep. Paul Ryan, the supposed numbers man of the Republican Party, repeatedly called the stimulus a wasteful spending spree, and then we found out he wrote letters asking for stimulus money in his district (PDF), because according to him, it would ""stimulate the local and area economy by creating new jobs."" It was hard for real Americans to take criticism of the Recovery Act seriously when those doing the criticizing were busy talking out of both sides of their anti-Obama mouths. And that's exactly what we've watched for much of four years: the president's critics being more focused on making him look like a failure than on helping the country succeed. Some call it politics. I call it unpatriotic. Either way, despite the disrespect and the disregard and the attempts to suppress votes or intimidate voters, despite the misguided cry of ""take our country back,"" Obama was re-elected because the majority of the American people saw the truth. You remember when Ryan stood up in front of nation during the Republican National Convention and blamed the president for a plant closing in Janesville, Wisconsin? Yeah, turns out the closure was planned before Obama even took office. The people in Janesville knew the truth, which is probably why more than 60% of the county it's in voted for Obama. Opinion: Five things Obama must do . There is no need to take this country back, because it hasn't gone anywhere ... except forward ... toward a more perfect union where the ""All-American look"" is getting a little bit harder to define. That may make a lot of people uncomfortable, but personal discomfort isn't a good enough reason to slight 25 consecutive months of job growth, resurgent house prices and corporations seeing record profit. Every president since Theodore Roosevelt has talked about reforming health care, and Obama is the one who got it done -- yet his critics say he's done nothing since he's been in office. Now, of course, there is still a lot of work ahead. We have a deficit to address, a fiscal cliff that is threatening millions of jobs and a GDP that is limping. And the administration is going to make mistakes. Every administration does. But now that this election is finally over, maybe more Republicans will be willing to take a page from the book of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and give Obama some credit for the things he's done right. We can still challenge the president's ideas without asking for his papers or spitting on our highest office. When I think about where this country was four years ago -- with us losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month, engulfed in two wars and disliked by many of our allies -- I believe Obama has done a lot that's right. And from the looks of his resounding re-election, the majority of real Americans feel the same way. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Some critics don't just disagree with him; they disrespect him .

"(CNN) -- Paul McIlhenny, the chairman and chief executive of the company that makes Tabasco sauce, has died. He was 68. McIlhenny Company, based in Avery Island, Louisiana, said he died Saturday. The cause of death was not immediately clear. ""All of McIlhenny Company and the McIlhenny and Avery families are deeply saddened by this news,"" Tony Simmons, president of McIlhenny Company, said in a statement Sunday. ""We will clearly miss Paul's devoted leadership but will more sorely feel the loss of his acumen, his charm and his irrepressible sense of humor.""

"(CNN) -- It started with an overnight flight and a thunderstorm -- it finished with a place at the top end of the leaderboard. Phil Mickelson would dearly love to win the U.S. Open, having finished as runner-up on five occasions, but not even the lure of Merion was enough to keep him away from his daughter's eighth-grade graduation. The four-time major champion missed the practice rounds on Tuesday and Wednesday to be with daughter Amanda in California before flying through the night on his private jet to Philadelphia. Arriving in Pennsylvania at 4.15 a.m. Thursday morning, Mickelson easily made his 7.11 a.m. tee time and produced his lowest round in the U.S. Open since 1999 -- which came just days before Amanda was born -- with a three-under-par 67. It gave him the clubhouse lead, and when the rest of the field had finally finished their rounds Friday he had a one-shot advantage over England's former world No. 1 Luke Donald. ""I loved having an early tee time,"" Mickelson, whose round was halted by a lengthy delay due to heavy rain, told reporters. ""I wish we did not have the delay because it made it a long day but the golf course is playing about as easy as it could, but Merion is fighting hard. ""It's one of the best I've seen for a U.S. Open. It's soft but we are having a hard time getting under par."" The 42-year-old also insisted his preparation for the tournament has not been undermined by spending time back in California. ""When I was here the week before I was able to do all the work I needed, the last part was getting my game sharp so being able to do that in nice weather on a good practice facility was advantageous."" A weather break of three hours and 32 minutes meant an inauspicious start to the 113th U.S. Open, being hosted by Merion for the first time in 32 years. The Thursday morning starters managed just 111 minutes of play before torrential rain hit the course and forced play to be suspended. Donald, seeking his first major title, had been four under but dropped two shots in his last three holes after coming back to finish his round Friday. Big-hitting Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts was tied for third after completing a 69 on Friday, alongside Scottish surprise package Russell Knox -- ranked 398th in the world. Former Masters winner Charl Schwartzel shot 70 to be tied for fifth with fellow South African Tim Clark, Americans Jerry Kelly and Rickie Fowler, Australians Jason Day and John Senden plus Swede Peter Hedblom, England's former world No. 1 Lee Westwood and veteran South Korean K.J. Choi. Defending champion Webb Simpson completed a 71 to be in a big group including 2012 Masters winner Bubba Watson and his U.S. Ryder Cup teammates Dustin Johnson and Steve Stricker -- that trio finished their rounds on Thursday. Australia's 2013 Masters champion Adam Scott had been tied with Mickelson after 11 holes on Thursday, but carded three bogeys and a double to slump to a 72. World No. 3 Scott was playing with No. 1 Tiger Woods, who was two over after 10 holes Thursday, and No. 2 Rory McIlroy -- tied for 16th on even par through 11. Woods, who shrugged off suggestions he had seriously hurt his wrist while hitting out of the rough, added two bogeys and a birdie to sign for a 73. ""My left arm didn't feel too good on a few shots but overall it was not too bad a round,"" he told reporters. ""I missed a load of putts."" McIlroy, the 2011 U.S. Open winner, had the same score after dropping shots at three of his last four holes Friday. Meanwhile, Sergio Garcia revealed he was heckled by ""a couple of guys"" during his opening round of 73. His jibe last month that he would invite Tiger Woods round for ""fried chicken"" during the U.S. Open led to an immediate and unreserved apology from the Spaniard, who denied it was racially motivated. Woods took to Twitter to register his disappointment with the remarks, calling them ""wrong, hurtful and clearly inappropriate."" The two men shook hands on Monday and Garcia has sent Woods a note, but he confirmed he had yet to hear from the American. Woods, 37 has not won a major since he won the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines in 2008 where he defeated Rocco Mediate on a playoff while playing with a broken leg. A 15th major victory would take him to within three of all-time record of 18 set by Jack Nicklaus, whose final triumph came at the 1986 Masters at Augusta.","Phil Mickelson opens with three-under 67 in first round of U.S. Open for clubhouse lead .

"(CNN) -- Greece is being asked to make ""great sacrifices"" but the country's sick will not suffer from a lack of medical help, health minister Andreas Likourentzos says. His comments come as cancer patients protest against health care reforms they say are cutting them off from expensive but life-saving drugs. Likourentzos, of the New Democracy party, told CNN: ""We need to cut down the expenses but these cuts will not negatively affect those who need direct access to healthcare services."" Greece spends 11 billion euros ($14.4 billion) annually on its healthcare system -- taking up 5.5% of the country's total economic output. Likourentzos said the healthcare system is 2 billion euros [$2.6 billion] in debt. The country needs to cut the sector's expenses back from 3.7 billion euros [$4.8 billion] last year to 2.9 billion euros [$3.7 billion] this year, he said. The cuts are due to be made as Greece, at the center of the eurozone's financial crisis, comes under intense pressure from both its international lenders and suppliers to its health care system. ""What the pharmacists say is true. We owe money to the pharmacists, the pharmaceutical companies and generally all the suppliers of the national health system,"" he said. The healthcare service cuts are part of broader austerity plans Greece must push through -- including cuts of 11.5 billion euros [$15 billion] -- if it is to receive its next tranche of bailout cash. The Troika -- a group of auditors made up of the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Union -- is in Greece to assess the progress of the country's austerity program and reforms to public finances.

"(CNN) -- Firefighters gained ground in recent days in the battle with a wildfire that burned 84 buildings and blackened 28,000 acres of dense forest in northern California. The Ponderosa fire, which is in a remote area of Shasta County, California, is just one of 42,750 wildfires that have burned 6,901,035 acres in the United States this year, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. The fire, ignited by lightning five days ago, was 57% contained by Thursday, allowing some families forced from their homes to return, fire officials said. The Ponderosa fire still threatens 900 homes, forcing those residents to evacuate. Nearly 2,500 people, equipped with 263 firetrucks and 11 helicopters, are involved in the effort to stop the Ponderosa fire. Fires rage on Canary Islands . Shasta is one of three northern California counties for which Gov. Jerry Brown has declared states of emergency because of wildfires this week. The other counties included in the declaration, which makes emergency funding available to fight the blazes, are Plumas and Tehama. In Plumas County, the Chips fire has burned 63,147 acres, most of it in the Plumas National Forest. The 1,146 personnel fighting it have managed to gain 40% containment, according to officials.

"(CNN) -- Our Congress sucks. This is truly one of the few things we agree on. In fact, a new CNN poll released earlier this week found that Congress has only a 10% approval rating. When you think that 10% of Americans believe Congress is doing a good job, you have to ask yourself one question: Who are these people?! (Imagine this asked with true Jerry Seinfeld-esque exasperation.) Congress is so dysfunctional that dictators in other countries are probably pointing at it as an example of why you should never have a democracy. Yet, somehow, about 30 million Americans are looking at what Congress is doing and thinking: ""I like what I see."" If you actually think Congress is doing a good job, something is terribly awry in your life. People in your family need to stage an immediate intervention. I was so intrigued by these people who have such horribly low standards (where were they when I was still dating?) that I went on to social media to find them. I posed questions on Facebook and Twitter asking if anyone is among this exclusive club known to me as the ""Ten Percenters."" What was the response? No one admitted to it. But a few offered theories regarding who these people could be: . ""It's probably friends and family of Congress,"" Ahmed Elsayed posted on Facebook. ""Ten percent of Americans are in a COMA?!?!"" Laurence Cruz tweeted. I'm pretty confident he's not related to Sen. Ted Cruz. Keith Conrad tweeted a cynical but possibly accurate view: ""Some people just want to watch the world burn."" How could it be that no one knows who these people are? Could it be that those who said they approved of Congress were kidding? Perhaps the pollster asked, ""Do you think Congress is doing a good job?"" and they responded: ""Fabulous,"" but they meant that sarcastically? Because all I can say is -- If you do know people who actually believe Congress is doing a good job, please watch over them carefully. These are the type of people that lead to warning labels on products like bleach that state ""Do not drink"" and on blow dryers that read: ""For external use only."" Let's get back to the real issue: Congress. Besides mocking it with lines like, ""Congress is now less popular than syphilis,"" what can actually be done to remedy the situation? Some say we should impeach or recall Congress. Well, you can't. The Constitution only provides one procedure to remove members of Congress. Want to guess who decides on when that happens? Yup, it's Congress. It takes a two-thirds vote of Congress itself to expel a member. The only people who think that Congress would vote themselves out of a job that pays $174,000 a year plus health benefits are the 10% of Americans who think Congress is doing a good job. Can we realistically hope that since the congressional approval rating is so low that there will be a big house cleaning in the 2014 midterm elections on its own? Unlikely. Even in 2012, when Congress was riding ""high"" with an abysmal 18% approval rating, did we see many members of Congress booted? Nope. In fact, 90% of the members of Congress who sought re-election in 2012 won. The reality is that Congressional districts have been crafted (aka gerrymandered) by state legislatures in an often grotesque fashion, rendering a large number of congressional seats uncompetitive. Consequently, congressional reps have the freedom to be more unbearable and less compromising than ever before. So what else can we do? Some call for term limits -- which I think is a great idea -- although you never know if the same politicians would just be voted in again. And to implement that, we would have to amend the U.S. Constitution. There are two procedures to do that: Congress starts the process by passing a resolution in support of the proposition with a two-thirds vote. Ain't gonna happen. The other method is by way of a Constitutional Convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures. That is a possibility if a large grassroots movement emerged, but it's challenging. Not one of the 27 amendments to our Constitution were enacted by this procedure. The easiest way is to effect change is to pledge to collectively put aside partisan politics and vote only for candidates in the 2014 primaries and general election who run on a platform of going to Congress to work in a bipartisan manner for our common good. It's time we send home those people who would want the world to burn because it helps them get on TV and furthers their own political ambitions. If we do this, then one day we might have a Congress that not only has an approval rating above most venereal diseases, but one we can actually be proud of.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Republican-controlled House of Representatives delivered a mixed message on America's role in the NATO-led Libya campaign Friday, opposing a resolution expressing support for the war while also voting down a bill restricting American involvement in the conflict. The first measure -- similar to legislation introduced in the Senate by Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, and Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona -- was backed by the White House. It was defeated 123-295, with Republicans overwhelmingly opposing the measure and Democrats voting more narrowly in favor of it. The second measure was strongly supported by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and other top GOP leaders.  It was defeated 180-238, with Democrats largely voting no as Republicans voted yes by a slimmer margin. In short, the House appeared unable to speak with clarity on President Barack Obama's controversial effort to oust Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. White House press secretary Jay Carney expressed disappointment in the first House vote, and told reporters the ""writing is on the wall"" for Gadhafi. ""Now is not the time to let up,"" he said. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was ""gratified that the House has decisively rejected efforts to limit funding for the NATO mission."" ""I am pleased that a very important statement was made today by the House, on a bipartisan basis, that recognizes the need for us to continue this important mission,"" she added. Asked to explain the relatively rare defeat for the House leadership on the second vote, Boehner only offered a one-word reply: ""nothing."" A GOP leadership aide, however, told CNN there was last-minute concern among some Republican members that a vote to restrict certain forms of U.S. involvement in the NATO mission could have been interpreted as an inherent authorization of other types of force. ""Once you de-facto (approve) it ... then the president can run with it,"" said Rep. Scott Garrett, R-New Jersey, who opposed both measures. ""What we're trying to do here is have our cake and eat it too.  We're trying to split it in half by declaring a partial war and then telling (Obama) how he is going to be commander-in-chief."" ""I don't think you can do that in a bill,"" Garrett said. ""The proper resolution would say we should not be over there, (and) we are withholding all funds for all military activity, period."" Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Virginia, who backed the support resolution while opposing the bill restricting involvement, said he wasn't lobbied by the White House until Friday morning. ""I think moving forward, a lesson (about administration outreach) has been learned here,"" he said. Much of the House's disapproval of the Libya campaign has been fueled by a belief that Obama failed to sufficiently consult with Congress before committing to military engagement. Specifically, representatives from both political parties say the administration has violated the 1973 War Powers Resolution, which gives the president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending U.S. forces to war, followed by a 30-day extension to end hostilities. The combined 90-day period ended last Sunday. Support for the war has also been further shaken by evidence of several noncombatant deaths caused by recent NATO airstrikes. The White House says Obama didn't need congressional authorization because U.S. forces are playing only a supporting role in Libya and haven't engaged in what the law defines as hostilities. The president, however, personally overruled contrary legal opinions put forward by both the Pentagon and the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, according to a report published Saturday in The New York Times. Boehner said during Friday's debate on the House floor that Obama's authority under the Constitution ""does not free the president from accountability to the American people, this Congress or the rule of law."" The War Powers Resolution ""is the law of the land and simply cannot be ignored,"" he said. The GOP-sponsored bill is necessary to ""defend the constitutional authority of the legislature"" and provides ""much-needed accountability."" Some Democrats, however, blasted Republicans, accusing them of playing politics with what they called a critical foreign policy priority. ""This was not handled right"" by the White House, said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas. But the House votes are ""nothing but politics,"" and ""I don't want to abandon my friends in the Arab states who are now struggling for democracy."" Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday it would be a mistake for Congress to cut funding for U.S. military operations in Libya. ""I think, once we have our forces engaged, to deny them funding would be a mistake,"" Gates told PBS News. Key American allies -- especially the British, the French and the Italians -- consider Libya a vital interest, and ""our alliance with them is a vital interest for us,"" he said, citing their efforts in Afghanistan. Gates insisted that progress has been made toward the U.S. goal of ousting Gadhafi. ""Based on everything we see, the government gets shakier by the day,"" Gates said. ""His forces have been significantly diminished. The opposition is expanding the areas under their control."" Clinton met privately with House Democrats on Thursday to urge support for the resolution backing the Libya mission, according to a Democratic source who attended the meeting. ""The bottom line is, whose side are you on?"" she said earlier in the week.  ""Are you on Gadhafi's side, or are you on the side of the aspirations of the Libyan people and the international coalition that has been created to support them?"" The allied military effort, which has formal United Nations support, was launched to protect Libyan civilians from violence stemming from a crackdown launched by Gadhafi. Western leaders have made clear, however, that they believe the mission cannot be successfully completed without Gadhafi's ouster. The White House has promised not to use U.S. ground troops, but bipartisan congressional opposition to the military campaign has nevertheless been mounting over several weeks. In addition to concerns about the War Powers Resolution, traditional anti-war Democrats and fiscally conservative Republicans are worried about the cost of the conflict. In a recent report on the mission, the administration said the cost of military and humanitarian operations through June 3 was about $800 million. It estimated the total cost through September 30 would be $1.1 billion. CNN's Dana Bash, Rachel Streitfeld and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","House rejects bill that would have cut funding for U.S. offensive operations in Libya .

"(CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he had some ""pretty good fights"" with Sen. Frank Lautenberg. But Lautenberg's death early Monday puts the Republican governor in a pretty good bind in replacing him. Lautenberg dies; was U.S. Senate's last WW II vet . ""It's no mystery that Sen. Lautenberg and I didn't always agree,"" Christie said Monday of the liberal Democrat. ""In fact, it probably is more honest to say we very often didn't agree, and we had some pretty good fights between us over time -- battles on philosophy and the role of government."" Lautenberg: The last 'swamp dog' As Christie, a Republican, runs for what is expected to be a relatively easy re-election, he now invites unwanted attention as he decides on a temporary replacement for Lautenberg. Ad hits Christie rival for tax record . If he doesn't name a conservative, that could complicate his already strained relationship with conservatives from across the country, which could spell trouble if Christie decides to run for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. Two conflicting New Jersey state laws about when to hold a special election to fill a vacant U.S. Senate seat add complexity. One statute says that ""if a vacancy shall happen in the representation of this State in the United States Senate, it shall be filled at the general election next succeeding the happening thereof, unless such vacancy shall happen within 70 days next preceding such election."" The next general election in the Garden State is in November, when Christie is up for re-election. Since Lautenberg's death is not within 70 days of that election, a special election to fill the final year of Lautenberg's term could be held this November. But another state statute says that if the vacancy happens within 70 days of the primary that precedes the next general election, the special election will be held at the second succeeding election. The primary for this November's contests is Tuesday. Since Lautenberg's death is well within that window, under this provision an election would not be held until November 2014, with the winner serving a full six-year term. Both statutes agree that the governor is authorized to set the date for such an election. There are some obvious political advantages for Christie to put the election off until 2014. Polls show that Christie has a 2-1 advantage right now over Democratic state Sen. Barbara Buono. But a Republican strategist from New Jersey tells CNN that a special Senate election this November could increase Democratic turnout, especially if Newark Mayor Cory Booker is on the ballot. Booker is considering his own run for Senate in 2014. Even with a very large lead over Buono, why would a GOP governor running for re-election in a blue state want to invite higher Democratic turnout this year? If Christie decides to hold the Senate contest in 2014 with a hand-picked replacement serving 18 months by Election Day, it could invite legal action from New Jersey Democrats. State party Chairman John Wisniewski tells CNN that ""it's a slap in the face to New Jersey voters not to have a say in who represents them for a year and a half."" Wisniewski says New Jersey Democrats expect the election to be this November, pointing to what he says is the most recent statute by state lawmakers on the timing of such a vote. Sources close to the governor say Christie has made no decisions because it's so early in the process. But they expect him to announce a 2014 Senate election rather than a special contest this year. While there's controversy over the timing of an election, an even bigger question is who would Christie name to immediately fill the seat? And what impact would that pick have on his 2013 re-election run and any possible 2016 bid? One top name to emerge is state Sen. Joe Kyrillos, a longtime Christie ally who last November lost to the state's other U.S. senator, Democrat Bob Menendez, by 20 percentage points. Other possibilities include Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno; state Assemblyman Jon Bramnick, who appears to be gearing up to run for the Senate in 2014; and state lawmaker Tom Kean Jr., son of former GOP Gov. Tom Kean, a political mentor of Christie. Some pundits have suggested that Christie could even appoint the former governor, now 78, as a caretaker until a special election. There were also rumors Christie would consider Booker, since the Democrat took a pass on challenging him for governor this year. But both sides shot down such a farfetched scenario. Christie is touting his ability to work with Democrats, and he's won the endorsement of a number of Democratic politicians. Choosing a moderate Republican would not rock the boat, but choosing a more conservative or partisan Republican could cause problems. Such a pick, however, would help Christie mend fences with national conservatives, still upset with his praise of President Barack Obama personally and of the federal response in the wake of Superstorm Sandy. Obama channels Springsteen in touring Jersey storm recovery . While Christie's approval rating in New Jersey soared after Sandy and has remained high, some commentators in his own party blasted him for his praise of Obama, saying it contributed to the defeat of GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Christie's criticism in January of House Republicans' slow -- but eventual -- approval of federal recovery aid to Sandy victims and the governor's teaming up with Obama again last week to promote recovery efforts along the Jersey shore haven't helped. Rich Bolen, a GOP activist in South Carolina, the first Southern state to vote in the presidential primary and caucus calendar, expressed a critical conservative sentiment. ""Christie burned a lot of bridges with conservatives and tea partiers before the last election cavorting with Obama in the Sandy aftermath. Even though most people don't think it really affected the election, it just made Christie look more wishy-washy,"" he said. ""If Christie appoints a ""Northeast moderate placeholder, red state America will be irrevocably opposed to him throughout the 2016 primary process,"" added Bolen, the former head of the Lexington County, South Carolina, GOP. Similar feelings were found in Iowa, which kicks off the overall caucus and primary calendar. ""I do think that Gov. Christie's selection will have a major impact on his 2016 presidential aspirations,"" said Craig Robinson, a GOP strategist and founder and editor-in-chief of the Iowa Republican. ""Many conservatives have grown frustrated with Christie since last November and this provides him an opportunity to heal some of those wounds by appointing someone who has broad appeal with Republicans. If Christie would happen to nominate a Democrat, any presidential aspirations would immediately go up in smoke,"" he said. Christie's quandary was so appetizing, it even invited a comment from David Axelrod, the senior adviser behind Obama's 2008 and 2012 victories. ""Fascinating dilemma for Christie. Does he name interim who reflects his more moderate state, or feed Tea Party for '16?"" tweeted Axelrod.","Law allows N.J. governor to temporarily fill seat held by late Sen. Frank Lautenberg .

"(CNN) -- In order to avoid the death penalty, U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales intends to plead guilty in the killing of 16 Afghan villagers, his lawyer said Wednesday. A plea deal -- which Bales' lawyer John Henry Browne told CNN about by text message, as he was meeting with his client -- must be approved by a judge and a commanding general. In addition to those killed, six Afghans were wounded in the March 2012 attack near a small U.S. base in Afghanistan's Kandahar province. Missteps, closed culture undermine confidence in military justice system . The shooting spree strained already tense U.S.-Afghan relations and intensified a debate about whether to pull out American troops ahead of their planned 2014 withdrawal. The Army would not comment on any potential deal Wednesday. A hearing in the case is scheduled for June 5. Bales' attorneys have said that he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and sustained a traumatic brain injury during a prior deployment to Iraq. Afghan girl tells court she hid behind father as he was shot . ""We think the Army is attempting to escape responsibility for the decision to send Sgt. Bales to Afghanistan for his fourth deployment, knowing that he had (post-traumatic stress disorder) and a concussive head injury,"" Browne said last year.

"(CNN) -- A U.S. satellite project said Wednesday it has found evidence of additional mass graves in South Kordofan, a day after the Sudanese president called for a unilateral cease-fire in the state. The Satellite Sentinel Project said it has evidence of a total of eight mass graves in the area since June, including two additional ones recently in and around Kadugli. Kadugli is the capital of the border state. The project cited witness accounts and images of what it says are body bags. ""This report presents more visual evidence and new information by eyewitnesses ... of the collection and burial of human remains wrapped in tarps and/or body bags by the Sudanese Red Crescent Society,"" it said in a statement. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir rejected the findings as propaganda from the west. The Satellite Sentinel Project, which is partially funded by U.S. actor George Clooney, is based on the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative's analysis of satellite imagery and witness reports. In the past, the government has said rebels are to blame for the violence in the region, and has been engaged in a fierce campaign to battle what it says are militia in the area. Al-Bashir on Tuesday called for a two-week, unilateral cease-fire in the state, saying the government would assess the situation after that period. The report follows allegations by human rights groups that Sudanese forces have conducted widespread killings in the region this summer. The project has said its evidence is consistent with allegations that Sudan forces and militias ""have engaged in a campaign of killing civilians."" Nuba fighters helped South Sudan during the civil war with Sudan, which raged for decades and left millions dead. South Sudan became an independent nation in July. South Kordofan remains a territory of the Sudanese government in the north, but borders South Sudan. In July, a United Nations report detailed new allegations of violence, including mass graves, in the volatile border state. Reported incidents included aerial attacks that killed civilians, attacks on churches, arbitrary arrests, abductions and house-to-house searches, said the report. ""This report provides only a small window on what's happening in Southern Kordofan,"" Philippe Bolopion of Human Rights Watch said last month.","NEW: Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir rejects the findings .

"(CNN) -- Two lightning-triggered wildfires that have charred 24,000 acres in drought-stricken West Texas threaten 150 homes and 250 other buildings, officials said Wednesday. ""We're going to do everything we humanly, safely can do to protect those homes and residents,"" Incident Commander Tony Wilder said. Jeff Davis County officials ordered voluntary evacuations, but residents have not left some neighborhoods, Texas Forest Service spokeswoman April Saginor said. About 250 firefighters, including ""hot shot teams"" from Arizona, Nevada and Georgia, are on the scene to battle the two blazes in steep, rugged terrain, Saginor said. The leading edge of the Livermore fire, which has burned 13,387 acres since last week, is within a mile of the Davis Mountain Resort community, fire officials said in a statement Wednesday. The fire is about 30% contained, it said. ""Winds associated with afternoon thunderstorm activity are making the firelines difficult to hold,"" the statement said. The Spring Mountain fire, which is 60% contained, has burned 10,576 acres northwest of Fort Davis since starting April 24, it said.

"Voronezh, Russia (CNN) -- Russian authorities have imposed a state of emergency around about 500 towns and villages because of wildfires burning across the west of the country, officials said Monday. Most of the fires -- among the worst ever to hit the region -- were started accidentally by people burning garbage, dropping cigarettes, or failing to extinguish campfires or barbecues properly, Emergency Situations Ministry representative Irina Andrianova said. Nearly 700 fires are burning, covering about 115,000 hectares, she said. That is nearly 450 square miles. A hectare is about the size of a baseball field or an international rugby pitch. CNN iReport: Share your images and stories . Some 34 people have been confirmed dead, Andrianova said. That includes two firefighters, the Russian news agency Itar-Tass reported over the weekend, citing the emergencies ministry. Firefighters moved in to protect 86,000 people from the fires, she said. About 5,000 of those people fled their homes. The rest are from 265 villages and towns that were protected from the blazes by firefighters, but did not have to evacuate, she said. Heat and drought have made Russia especially susceptible to wildfires, she said. High temperatures are expected to continue through the middle of August, with no rain forecast. Authorities said Sunday that firefighters were gaining control over the blazes. ""Despite complicated weather conditions, the situation is under control thanks to preventive measures and efforts taken by the Russian Emergencies Ministry,"" a spokesman for the ministry told the Itar-Tass news agency. ""The most difficult situation with wildfires remains in the Nizhny Novgorod, Vladimir and Voronezh regions and the Republic of Mordovia, where fires threaten several populated settlements,"" the ministry's information department said. A hot, dry summer has been a key factor in the fires, drying out large parts of land and igniting the peat bogs that lie all over central Russia. Moscow hit a temperature of 39 Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) on Thursday, the highest temperature since records began in 1879. In the village of Maslovka, near Voronezh, almost every house in the village of 500 people had burned to the ground. All the residents of Maslovka had been evacuated to nearby hotels. A resident of Maslovka named Nina said she had returned to the village after the fire to sift through the rubble of the house where she was born. For 50 years, she said, she lived under the same roof. A few days ago, the wildfires were swept by high winds to the village and quickly engulfed her house. Now there is nothing left. Even the clothes she was wearing were not hers -- they had been given to her by a neighbor. As Nina told her story, an old lady walked from behind a broken wall, wailing. Nina said the woman was her mother, devastated that she had lost the home where she raised her family. Russia's government has vowed to compensate the more than 1,870 families whose houses have been burned down. Amid complaints, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has ordered regional governors to speed up the compensation process. The Kremlin has called the wildfires a natural disaster of the kind that appear every 30 or 40 years. Critics, meanwhile, accuse local authorities of mismanaging the response. Russia says it has deployed nearly a quarter of a million people to fight the fires. But around Voronezh, many of the firefighters were just volunteers with buckets.","Hundreds of fires are burning, covering an area the size of 115,000 baseball diamonds .

"(CNN) -- Like a viper that slithers through the garden -- mostly unseen, menacing, dangerous -- a troubling trend is taking hold in this country, a movement to shake the foundations of what ""born in the USA"" means. Wendy Ruiz was born in Miami in 1992. She graduated from a Miami public high school in 2010 and applied to Florida International University, a four-year state college that required her to disclose her parents' federal immigration status. Ruiz was unable to provide this information, so she was denied admission. She then applied to Miami Dade College to complete a two-year degree. When her acceptance letter arrived, there was a catch: She would be required to pay the out-of-state tuition rate. How could this be possible when Wendy Ruiz had lived her entire life in Florida? As the law stands, all children born in the United States, including those to undocumented immigrants, are granted U.S. citizenship. There are approximately 4.5 million American children like Wendy Ruiz who are U.S. citizens by virtue of birthright, yet whose parents are undocumented for federal immigration purposes. These U.S. citizen children of undocumented parents are Americans. Many will join the military and help fight our wars to keep us safe. Most of them will someday work and pay Social Security taxes so our aging population can enjoy a comfortable retirement (perhaps even in Florida). Yet politicians seeking to brandish their nativist credentials will do almost anything to discriminate against these American children, whom they call ""anchor babies."" One of the most egregious examples of this blatant discrimination -- one such ""viper"" -- occurs in my home state. The Sunshine State is the only state that unambiguously denies in-state tuition to U.S. citizen children of undocumented immigrants. (Similar cases have arisen in other states, like Arizona, Colorado, California, New Jersey and Virginia.) This out-of-state classification not only denies these students the preferential treatment in the admissions process that residents usually receive, but it also affects the tuition they must pay as ""out of state"" students. The tuition difference is stunning. At Miami Dade College, the cost per year in the two-year associate degree programs is $2,532 for residents, compared to $9,047 for students classified as nonresidents. The cost per year in the four-year bachelor's degree program at FIU is $2,800 for residents, compared to $12,492 for nonresidents. The net effect is that these students either delay or entirely forgo a college education because they simply can't afford the higher tuition. This insidious policy excludes talented, qualified young adult citizens from pursuing higher education -- because their parents lack immigration documents. Such wrongheaded policy has not gone unnoticed. The Southern Poverty Law Center filed a federal class action lawsuit in the Southern District Court of Florida charging systemic discrimination. Last week, Judge K. Michael Moore found that Florida is violating the constitutional rights of American-born children of undocumented immigrants by requiring them to pay higher tuition rates than other students at state colleges. He said, ""It is the plaintiffs who, upon graduating from a post-secondary educational institution, receive their names on diplomas, and it is plaintiffs â€” not plaintiffs' parents, cousins, or siblings â€” who are entitled to the benefits conferred by such a degree."" Moore was appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1992 and is known not only for his keen intellect but also for his commonsense jurisprudence. Nearly 20 years ago he offered me a clerkship to work with him upon graduation from Columbia Law School and he swore in my Panamanian father as an American citizen in a private ceremony in his office. In his decision last week, his common sense and practical justice was clear; preferential in-state tuition rates for all Florida residents are simply a wise investment in Florida's future. Columbia University professor Neeraj Kaushal examined the effect of in-state tuition on enrollment rates at universities in California, New York, Texas and Utah, and compared those rates to 46 other states. She concluded that favorable in-state tuition policies resulted in a 31% increase in college enrollment rates. Also, graduates of state colleges tend to remain in the Florida workforce, where they earn more, pay higher taxes, promote the educational attainment of their own children, vote more, depend less on welfare and live healthier lives. Florida college graduates will typically earn 66% more than high school graduates over their working lives. These higher earnings mean higher tax payments at the local, state and federal levels. A college graduate will likely pay up to 80% more in taxes each year than someone with no college degree. Even during periods of high unemployment, those with college degrees re-enter the labor market sooner. Florida clearly benefits from providing an affordable post-secondary education to all its own high school graduates, regardless of their parents' immigration status. The state's lawyers argued that ""by offering in-state tuition rates to the U.S. citizens of undocumented immigrants, the state would be forced to offer in-state tuition rates to all U.S. citizens."" But Moore said the state's claim was based on its ""flawed interpretation"" of the 1996 federal welfare reform law, because the Florida students who sued the state ""are not 'aliens' but rather U.S. citizens."" Local Florida communities benefit, too, from students with a post-secondary education, as the increased salaries of these graduates is predicted to create more than 250,000 jobs and add $33 billion to Florida's economy over their working lifetime if the state realizes its five goals by 2016. If Florida wins, the whole country wins, because education increases the productivity of the United States, and the net effect is a rise in the gross national product. When one of the most pressing issues of our time -- education -- is seen through the lens of the worldview of those who would call Wendy Ruiz an ""anchor baby,"" denying her what all U.S. citizens are entitled to, the terrible costs of such a vision become crystal clear. The snake in the garden has reared its head -- and fortunately, wisdom has prevailed in the form of Judge Moore's decision. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles P. Garcia.","Charles Garcia: A judge ruled that children of immigrants in Florida deserve in-state tuition .

"London (CNN) -- A 22-year-old man appeared in court Thursday after he was charged with murder in the death of British soldier Lee Rigby in London last week. Flanked by two police officers, Michael Adebowale spoke to confirm his name, his address and that he was aware of the charges against him. Adebowale is also charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, a Dutch revolver, the Metropolitan Police said Wednesday. His hands were cuffed in front of him and he wore a gray long-sleeved shirt and white trousers for the brief appearance at Westminster Magistrates' Court. Addressing Adebowale, Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle said that he could sit rather than stand because he was injured. Adebowale appeared to walk uncomfortably and his right hand was wrapped in what could have been a medical dressing. He was discharged from a hospital Tuesday and has been held in custody since at a police station. The magistrate referred Adebowale's case to a higher court -- the Old Bailey in London, also known as the Central Criminal Court -- where he will have a bail hearing June 3 and a further preliminary hearing June 28. ""There is sufficient evidence to prosecute Michael Adebowale and it is in the public interest to do so,"" said Sue Hemming, head of the Crown Prosecution Service's Special Crime and Counter-Terrorism Division. A 28-year-old suspect remains under arrest at a London hospital. He has been identified by family, friends and acquaintances as Michael Adebolajo. In all, 10 people have been arrested in connection with the killing. Two were released without charges, while six others have been freed on bail -- the most recent a 50-year-old man arrested Monday night on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. The brutal killing of Rigby, who had served as an infantryman in Afghanistan and Cyprus, in the southeast London district of Woolwich shocked people across the United Kingdom. He was run over by a car and then stabbed in a daylight attack near the barracks where he was based. A post mortem examination found that the soldier's cause of death was from ""multiple incised wounds,"" police said Wednesday. An inquest into his death is due to open Friday. Two men were shot and injured after armed police were called to the scene May 22. Rigby was married and had a 2-year-old son. His wife, Rebecca Rigby, said last week that he had been planning to visit them so they could discuss their future. Meanwhile, another woman who said she was Rigby's fiancÃ©e told Britain's Press Association that she's ""extremely proud"" of him and ""devastated"" by his death. Aimee West's comments came in a statement to the news service issued through the Metropolitan Police. While police didn't relay that statement to CNN, they confirmed that they'd passed on West's remarks to the Press Association. ""I am moved by all the flowers and tributes, and that he has been remembered by the nation as the great man she was,"" West said.","Michael Adebowale will have a bail hearing Monday, the court says .

"(CNN) -- Even at the age of 82 the work ethic still burns bright in Arnold Palmer, the man who inspired a generation of baby-boomers to take up golf and whose support of the British Open proved pivotal for its future success. The elite of world golf gather at Royal Lytham and St. Annes this week on the 50th anniversary of Palmer's crushing victory at Scottish links course Troon in 1962 -- and ""The King"" still exerts a significant influence on the sport he once dominated. ""I would like to be remembered for bringing golf to a worldwide audience,"" Palmer told CNN. ""Players today have no boundaries."" As part of golf's ""Big Three,"" Palmer helped pioneering player agent Mark McCormack take the sport around the globe in the 1960s, capitalizing on the ever-growing reach of television. Why U.S. golf has a healthy future . The tournament Palmer still proudly hosts in the last week of March, at his Bay Hill course in Florida, attracts a stellar international lineup and was won this year by Tiger Woods. He is a very hands-on host, making sure the course is in top condition and appearing daily on the television coverage of the event. This year, he suffered a health scare after leaving the TV tower on the final day -- a blood pressure problem, according to his family -- and could not give out the prizes as has been tradition. But Palmer has made a full recovery and now, half century on from his second British Open triumph, the spotlight has again fallen on his trailblazing achievements. A leader of men . When he first played golf's oldest tournament in 1960, it had fallen out of favor with American pros. Ben Hogan in 1953 was the last from the U.S. to win it, and only three entered in 1959 -- put off by the long journey and comparatively low prize money on offer. Again there were only three Americans in the 74-man field at St. Andrews, one being the legendary Gene Sarazen -- still playing late into his 50s on a lifetime exemption dating back to his 1932 success. Palmer failed to emulate Hogan's triple-major feat, falling one shot short of Kel Nagle following earlier victories at the Masters and U.S. Open, but he returned to the UK the next year and claimed the coveted ""Claret Jug"" at Royal Birkdale. Palmer had already won his third Masters crown before romping to victory at Troon in 1962. ""I got it going in the final round and it was very enjoyable,"" he told CNN. Ever modest, Palmer's margin of victory over Nagle was six shots and he was a remarkable 13 strokes clear of third place. His 1961 exploits had inspired a young Jack Nicklaus to make his British Open debut at Troon, and the ""Golden Bear"" won it for the first time in 1966 -- two years after compatriot Tony Lema also triumphed at St. Andrews. By then Palmer had been represented by McCormack for several years, and their partnership helped changed the face of golf and modern sports. Famous deal . McCormack was a Cleveland attorney, only a year older than Palmer, and they famously struck their deal in 1960 with just a handshake. McCormack had seen his client's potential, and the increased television coverage of golf was extending his appeal to a wider audience. ""He was very smart. He was a motivator and went after it, and that was something I enjoyed,"" recalled Palmer. McCormack later persuaded Nicklaus and South Africa's Gary Player to join Palmer at his International Management Group (IMG) and the ""Big Three"" was born, popularizing golf worldwide in a series of made-for-television events. But Palmer held a very special place in the affections of the golfing galleries and it is easy to see why with his attacking play and flamboyant style. He was the first golfer to attract his own special following -- ""Arnie's Army"" -- diehard fans who surrounded every green to cheer him on, win or lose. Woods in his pomp had a similar fan base decades later, but Palmer was the first and he appreciated their support. ""They only encouraged me to continue to do the things I was doing and gave me the confidence I needed,"" he said. Charismatic star . But it was not only his fine play which drew them in. He had that ""something"" -- an aura, charisma combined with good looks. A hitch of his tightly fitting pants followed most shots, and his stylish outfits made him stand out from the average pro. ""It was not something I really planned,"" Palmer admitted. ""I liked a sharp crease in my slacks, my shoes polished to shine, while my shirts were conservative with a straight collar. ""It was a style I stuck with for most of my career."" Intentional or not, it has proved popular. GQ Magazine named him one of the ""50 most stylish men of the past 50 years"" and Esquire had him in a list of the ""75 best-dressed men of all time."" Golfers are rarely remembered for their fashion sense, usually the exact opposite, but the outfits he wore in 1962 have been recreated for a new range of Arnie Apparel. Palmer wanted promising PGA Tour player Ryan Moore to don the outfits -- ""I took a particular liking to him when he won the U.S. Amateur, a very polite young man"" -- and he has got his wish. Moore has won once on the lucrative U.S. calendar, in 2009, but if he can achieve a fraction of Palmer's achievements in golf, he will count himself lucky. Seven major wins, 62 in all on the PGA Tour, not to mention his later exploits on the Seniors circuit -- which he more than any other golfer helped publicize and give legitimacy to the idea of golfers aged 50 plus still competing at the top level. Endorsing success . With the business acumen of McCormack promoting his off-course activities, Palmer lent his image to a host of products and services, becoming the first sportsman to show that income from commercial endorsements could outstrip prize-money earnings. ""Mark was very good at marketing,"" Palmer said, and where he led, others were quick to follow. With the ""Big Three"" dominating golf, McCormack branched out into other sports such as tennis and then into the world of showbiz. He even marketed a papal tour of Britain in 1982. By the time McCormack died in 2003, IMG was the most powerful sports marketing company in the world and had Woods as its star client. Palmer's own commercial activities have helped him amass an estimated $675 million fortune, which is still growing despite his retirement from competitive golf in 2006. He is proud of his legacy on and off the course, and is optimistic for the future, particularly with golf winning inclusion to the 2016 Olympics in Rio. ""We will see more Third World countries participating. I think that's important, and we will see interest getting to the point when we can rival soccer and tennis,"" he predicted. Palmer may well get his wish, but he has already forged his place in golfing history as a true trailblazer.","This week marks 50th anniversary of Arnold Palmer's second victory at British Open .

"(CNN) -- Israel launched airstrikes on weapons facilities in Gaza in response to what Israel claimed were two rockets fired against it from the Palestinian territory, the Israeli military said Thursday. The two Gaza rockets were fired several hours apart Thursday against the Hof Ashkelon Regional Council, where 13,500 residents live, the military said. Israeli aircraft scored direct hits on a ""terror infrastructure"" in Gaza, a weapons manufacturing facility in central Gaza and a weapons storage facility in northern Gaza, the military said. The Israeli military blamed Hamas, which controls Gaza, for the rocket fire. Thursday's exchange of fire marked another uneasy moment in cease-fire arrangements between Israel and Gaza that were brokered last year when the two sides engaged in eight days of round-the-clock warfare, killing more than 160 Palestinians and six Israelis. ""The manufacturing of rockets in Gaza has no other purpose except to target Israel and its sovereignty putting thousands of lives at risk,"" Israel Defense Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said in a statement. ""We will not tolerate daily aggression from the Hamas ruled territory and are morally obligated to act against those threatening our communities, our towns and our cities.""","Two rockets from Gaza are fired upon Israel, military says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Justice Department on Friday night provided Congress with a new batch of Operation Fast and Furious documents from early 2011. They show a top Justice Department official and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives acting director suggested illegally purchased weapons be allowed to cross into Mexico where Mexican officials would be waiting to arrest, prosecute and convict the gun traffickers. Justice also sent a letter to Capitol Hill leaders providing details of a series of reforms made by the Justice Department and ATF to ensure there is no repeat of the controversial operation which allowed hundreds of illegal weapons to be sold in the United States and trafficked into Mexico. The intent of the operation was to monitor the flow of the weapons to their ultimate destination. The ATF plan was to track the weapons to Mexican drug cartels. However, hundreds of weapons were lost or unaccounted for. The Justice documents include an e-mail from a U.S. official in the Mexican Embassy which shows that in a meeting in early 2011 U.S. Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer suggested the illegal weapons could be intercepted if the two nations worked together. Then acting ATF chief Ken Melson made similar suggestions. Breuer ""suggested allowing straw purchasers cross into Mexico so (Mexican federal police) can arrest and (the Mexican attorney general's office] can prosecute and convict."" The e-mail author, a Justice official stationed at the embassy, said he thought that was risky because Mexico might not seize the weapons and a crime could be committed. The Justice officials were in Mexico City to coordinate with that nation's authorities after the death of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry near the Mexican border. Two illegally purchased weapons which were lost in Mexico were discovered at the crime scene where Terry was slain. The controversy is the subject of a hearing set for next Thursday. Attorney General Eric Holder is scheduled to testify before the House Investigations Committee chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-California). Holder is likely to stress the changes and reforms that have been made since the flawed operation occurred. In the letter to key congressional leaders Friday, the Justice Department said ATF policy now says it may be necessary to interdict illegal weapons early to ensure the safety of the public. The Justice Department also revealed that undercover operations have to be reviewed by an internal committee if they involve ""sensitive circumstances."" The letter to Congress also says ATF agents are undergoing special training ""based on the lessons"" of Fast and Furious.","Justice department sends documents to Congress .

"NASHVILLE, Tennessee (CNN) -- Former NFL quarterback Steve McNair may have been struggling to fill a void after retiring from football, something most star athletes go through when their careers come to an end, former teammate Eddie George told CNN. Eddie George runs after getting a handoff from Steve McNair in a 2004 game. ""I'm hoping that people can look beyond the circumstances surrounding his death. What people fail to realize is that when you make a transition away from the game -- emotionally, physically, mentally, spiritually -- you go through something. You change, and you're constantly searching for something,"" George said. Police said McNair, a married father of four children, was killed by his mistress Saturday in what they have classified as a murder-suicide. Police on Wednesday said Sahel Kazemi, 20, first shot McNair in his right temple, then fired three more shots at close range, most likely while he slept. She then sat on the couch next to his body and killed herself so that she would fall into his lap, police said.  Watch police describe the murder-suicide » . George was the star running back for the Tennessee Titans and had combined with McNair to create a potent offense that took the team to the Super Bowl in 2000. It was McNair who led the Titans in a dramatic comeback that day, only to fall a yard short on the final play of the game. George said that he last saw McNair this past football season when the Titans retired their jerseys and that they had a ""chance to relive our moments."" He said McNair, who retired from the NFL in April 2008, never indicated how bad he was struggling without football. ""Steve was a stoic, strong individual who never let on to anything wrong with his life,"" he said.  See McNair's football bio » . But George added almost every player struggles to cope in retirement and that ""different people handle it different ways."" ""I think underneath it all he was in search of filling a void -- and that stems from not playing the game. And that's what happens. Unfortunately,"" George said. ""I just know from experience that when you're used to doing something for so long that you love to do -- how do you fill that void?"" George continued. ""You're in search of something. Most players may go back to things they used to know. They may revert back to drugs, divorce rates go up, obesity. You're looking for something comforting. ""For Steve, it was uncharacteristic for him to be out there with this young lady like that. However, he was in search for something. So there's a much deeper issue here than just Steve and extramarital affairs. It was a person searching for something. So we need to have compassion for Steve and the young lady and his wife and family -- and really embrace that and celebrate his life and learn from anything else."" George added, ""I'm pretty sure if he were here today he'd say, 'You know what I'm sorry. Things happen. I'm a man.' But he had a beautiful heart. He was a beautiful spirit."" Hundreds of Titans fans descended on LP Field in Nashville on Wednesday to sign a condolence book and to bid their local hero goodbye. A memorial service is planned Thursday night at Mount Zion Baptist Church. Some Titans fans said they were unfazed by the tragic events that took McNair's life. They said they don't much care about the details of his personal life -- it's what he did for the team and the city during his amazing span as quarterback. ""His personal life, we don't even worry about that. What he did on the field was outstanding,"" Waverly Cameron said. Nell Badacour smiled from her wheelchair. She said she came to pay her respects to the ""real Steve McNair, the loving father and the loving husband and the great player and humanitarian he was."" ""I wanted to be here to honor the memory of Steve McNair and what he was to all the children and to his family and to the nation,"" Badacour said. Police on Wednesday officially classified the case as a murder-suicide that Kazemi carried out. Nashville Police Chief Ronal Serpas told reporters that Kazemi's life was spiraling out of control in the final week, believing that McNair had another mistress and that she talked about killing herself. He also said she was concerned about mounting debts. ""She had become very distraught and on two occasions told friends and associates that her life was all messed up and that she was going to end it all,"" Serpas said. He said Kazemi had seen another woman leave McNair's condo a few days before and was concerned ""whether or not her relationship was unraveling with Mr. McNair."" He said Kazemi followed the woman but never confronted her. In the end, Serpas said Kazemi decided to kill McNair and herself. ""McNair was seated on the sofa and likely was asleep, and we believe that Kazemi shot him in the right temple, then shot him twice in the chest and then shot him a final time in the left temple,"" Serpas said. ""Kazemi then positioned herself next to McNair on the sofa and shot herself once in the right temple and expired. ... We do believe she tried to stage that when she killed herself, she would fall in his lap."" Her body eventually slid to the floor, at McNair's feet. Serpas said a trace amount of gun residue was found on her left hand. Coroner Feng Li said her right hand was covered in so much blood it was impossible to detect any gun residue on that hand. George said he's still in shock over his friend's death. ""It's a sad ending to a great career, a great man, a pillar in the community. You just hate to see that.""

"(CNN) -- It was Tuesday evening when I happened upon a popular Fark.com link to a story on The Consumerist website praising the record-breaking success of Doritos Locos Tacos at Taco Bell, which has now sold more than 100 million crunchy, nacho-cheesy bundles of love. One hundred million! Think about it. At about 6 inches long, if you stacked each of these 100 million tacos lengthwise from end to end, you would be ... doing something very pointless. Now, for those of you who haven't actually seen a Doritos Locos Taco in person (i.e. productive citizens who don't drink past 2:30 in the morning) they're just what they sound like. Tacos ... wrapped in shells ... made from giant Doritos. It's amazing! It's culinary Xanadu! It's as if Taco Bell's marketing executives were poking around in my dreams. (Note: I dream about Doritos and tacos. And lately there's also been a lot of gnomes. Things are weird at home.) As I write this, it's 10:13 a.m. on Wednesday. Early as it may be, I feel I can't properly do this column justice without having at least one of these tacos in front of me, allowing partially hydrogenated soybean oil to be my muse. (Which is a slight departure from the 4,000 ounces of Diet Coke I usually look to for inspiration.) So, you all hang tight. I'm heading downstairs to the food court and putting you on hold for a moment. (click) Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough. (click) I'm back and I am so sorry for that. It's the only radio station we get here. But it could be worse, I once dropped five dollars in a jukebox, played Cher's ""Believe"" on repeat with all my credits, and walked out. It's probably the meanest thing I've ever done in my entire life. So, overall, I don't think I'm such a bad guy. Useless to society, yes. Otherwise, mostly harmless. Apparently This Matters: $1,300 HDMI cables . But let's get back to these tacos. The Consumerist cites an article by Nancy Luna in the Orange County Register that says this has been the ""most successful product launch in Taco Bell's 50-year history."" The article then quotes a Taco Bell spokesman who says the Crunchwrap has finally been ""dethroned."" Which is more than a little unsettling. Look, I'm just saying, if you represent Taco Bell, perhaps using the word ""throne"" isn't the smartest idea. Nevertheless, I'm proud to say that I am one of the millions who have helped the Doritos Locos Tacos become absolute world-beaters. I don't love them, but I do love the idea. It screams ""America!"" as I proudly shed a single red, white and blue teardrop. It's also possible that I have eye-herpes. Is that a thing? Anyway, I spent some time on the Taco Bell website today, mostly because it was a nice departure from doing actual work, and learned that they recommend you eat one of these with a Classic Limeade Sparkler. Someone received payment for pondering this pairing, and I'm sort of bummed that it wasn't me. Thus, I have to ask: How does one become the official Taco Bell sommelier? ""Hi, Jim. Thanks for coming in. Tell us, what makes you uniquely qualified for this position?"" ""The ability to point at things on your menu."" One hundred million tacos or not, sentiments on the Fark comment section for this link seemed to generally agree that, after about ten weeks of being in stores, Doritos Locos Tacos get an overall grade of: Meh. User Wade_Wilson wrote: Tried one. Don't see what all the fuss is about. Barely even tasted the Dorito.

"Washington (CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie opted for a special election to fill a newly vacant Senate seat through 2014 instead of appointing a replacement through that time, saying the decision was about giving voters ""a choice and a voice in the process"" and was not driven by political self-interest. While the Republican's decision for a special October ballot could help him avoid stronger Democratic turnout in his re-election bid a month later, it also opens him up to criticism from his own party that is on the short end of the balance of power in the Senate. Christie explained his decision one day after the Garden State's senior senator, Frank Lautenberg, a liberal Democrat, died at 89 after an illness. Christie said he would name a placeholder as soon as possible to fill the seat until the October election. Opinion: The last 'swamp dog' Democrats immediately slammed the move, asserting that Christie is wasting taxpayer money to protect his ambitions. National Republicans weren't critical but they didn't praise the governor, either. Christie announced that Democratic and Republican primary elections will be held on August 13 with the general election on October 16. The winner of the special election will serve out the final year of Lautenberg's term, and an election for a full six-year term will occur the following November. Christie sets October special election to replace Lautenberg . Voters should have say . While Christie said state law allowed him to name a replacement for the remaining year-and-a-half of Lautenberg's term, he believes an appointment over that period of time was not suitable or fair. ""The issues facing the United States Senate are too critically important and the decisions that need to be dealt with too vital not too have an elected representative making those decisions who was voted on and decided on by the people of this state. These decisions should be made by an elected official who represents the will of voters of New Jersey,"" Christie said. The expense of an election is also an issue during an era of belt tightening. The New Jersey Office of Legislative Services, an administrative wing of the Democrat-controlled state Legislature, estimates it will cost $12 million to state taxpayers to conduct a primary and another $12 million for a general election. Analysis: Christie helps himself . New Jersey is already voting in a general election on November 5, when Christie is bidding for a second term. So some ask why doesn't he save $12 million and schedule a special general election a few weeks later? Christie said state law only permits the option of an October special election or an election in 2014. Christie said ""there's no political purpose"" behind his decision on the election date. But polls show that he has a 2-1 advantage over state Sen. Barbara Buono, his Democratic challenger. And putting a special Senate election on the same day in November would most likely increase Democratic turnout, especially if Newark Mayor Cory Booker is on the ballot. Booker was considering his own run for Senate in 2014. By placing the special Senate election in October, Christie avoids Democratic turnout tied to this issue possibly becoming a problem for him. Democrats unhappy . National Democrats quickly blasted the decision. ""Governor Christie might not know or care how many millions of taxpayer dollars his special election gambit will waste, but the people of New Jersey certainly do. Christie should do the right thing, protect New Jersey taxpayer dollars instead of his own political career, and hold the Senate election on the same day as his own,"" Democratic Governors Association Executive Director Colm O'Comartun, said in a statement. Christie said that the costs associated with special primary and general elections ""cannot be measured"" against the value of an elected senator ""when so many consequential issues are being debated and determined this year."" State Democrats had threatened legal action if Christie pushed the election back to November 2014, but Christie's not sure if his decision averts a legal challenge, adding, ""In New Jersey, people sue over everything."" Opinion: The last 'swamp dog' Christie said he has yet to decide on a placeholder. But he said he has a list in his head and that he'll make a determination relatively soon. ""I'm looking for a person who's going to be a good United States senator,"" he said. The outspoken governor also said it wouldn't be fair to appoint a GOP placeholder to serve out the remainder of the late Democratic senator's term. ""I understand the political advantage that would come to me if I was the person, the sole person, to decide who would be in the Senate representing New Jersey for 18 months, but I just did not feel comfortable doing that,"" he said. Christie didn't say at the news conference whether the placeholder will be allowed to run in the special election, but a source close to the governor told CNN, ""Legally the appointee could run if he or she wanted to, but would have to go through the election process."" Republicans not praising Christie . National Republicans weren't criticizing Christie's decision, but they weren't praising it, either. ""I am sure the governor exercised whatever option he had in the best interest of his state and I won't question the path that he has chosen,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said. Christie's decision could complicate his already-strained relationship with national conservatives, which could spell trouble if he decides to run for president in 2016. ""I was disappointed he didn't pick a Republican to fill out the rest of the term, but not surprised,"" said Katon Dawson, the former Chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. ""Chris Christie has always done what's best for Chris Christie in New Jersey,"" added Dawson, whose state is traditionally one of the first to cast ballots in the presidential primary process. Many on the right are still upset with Christie's praise of President Barack Obama personally and the federal response in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, just days before last November's presidential election. Republican: 'Debilitating stupidity' While Christie's approval rating in New Jersey soared after Sandy and has remained high, some commentators in his own party blasted him for his praise of Obama, saying it contributed to the defeat of GOP nominee Mitt Romney. And Democrats were quick to point that out. ""Republicans have not won a Senate race in New Jersey in more than 40 years. Their only shot was an appointee who had a year and a half to establish themselves before an election in 2014,"" Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Deputy Executive Director Matt Canter said. ""With this news, I assume operatives at the NRSC are busy planning Christie's defeat in Iowa and New Hampshire right now."" Meanwhile, the rival National Republican Senatorial Committee pointed toward what could be a divisive Democratic primary. ""Democrats will now face an ugly primary sprint between Cory Booker, Rob Andrews and Frank Pallone -- all with substantial war chests and a healthy dislike for each other,"" NRSC spokesman Brad Dayspring said. ""Corey Booker did not want to have to wrap this up in two months."" Democratic Congressman Rush Holt may also make a bid for the Senate seat. CNN Senate Producer Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","Christie had decision to make about filling unexpired term of late Sen. Lautenberg .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Nadya Suleman on Thursday blamed the creation of the ""Octomom character"" that she has become synonymous with in part on a California fertility specialist who, she said, had her sign a consent form while she was drugged. The California woman said she did not mean to have eight children in January 2009, in addition to the six she already had. But while she admitted she did want more children, she insisted she was in no condition to understand a form Dr. Michael Kamrava put in front of her before implanting 12 embryos. ""He wrote something, he gave it to me to sign,"" Suleman told HLN's Dr. Drew Pinsky on Thursday night. She said she was then on ""a cocktail of drugs"" including Valium at the Beverly Hills doctor's office because her uterus was contracting. ""I signed it, and I didn't read it."" Kamrava lost his California medical license July 1 after state officials ruled that he committed ""gross negligence"" with ""repeated negligent acts, for an excessive number of embryo transfers"" into Suleman in 2008, the state's medical board wrote. The same report determined that the doctor felt the implantation was driven ""by the patient's wishes."" During a hearing for the doctor last October, it was revealed Suleman still has 29 frozen embryos in storage. Contrary to some reports, though, the 36-year-old woman insisted Thursday that she doesn't want any more children. That said, the single mother -- who said she has been celibate for 12 years, and had all 14 children by in vitro fertilization -- admitted that she chose to have children in part to address her emotional baggage. ""Is it fair to have a bunch of kids help solve your emotional issues? Of course not,"" she said. ""With children, I feel so safe in my predictable world. They will never leave me. Kids love you, unconditionally."" Suleman admits that she has a host of problems, including anxiety, panic attacks, hyperactivity and obsessive compulsive disorder. ""My brain and body are racing constantly,"" she added, noting she exercises extensively and only gets two hours of sleep a night. But expressing regret for contributing to ""this mess (that) has deleteriously affected my kids,"" Suleman said that she's now speaking out in part to refute having been made into what she called a ""parody without permission."" ""I have the spotlight, I know it's my responsibility (for my kids) to brush it away and get rid of the Octomom character,"" she said. With no steady income and expenses of over $18,000 a month, Suleman has struggled to get by raising her children. She has previously hosted a yard sale at her La Habra, California, home to deal with the hardship, and had reportedly signed on to be on the HDNet reality TV show ""Celebridate."" And now, Suleman said she is grateful for money she gets from media interviews, especially with overseas outlets. She also claims to have received ""hundreds of death threats,"" some targeting her children, as well as a few female stalkers. ""I am hated in my hometown,"" she said. Still, Suleman said that despite the difficulties she feels things are improving. And despite her admitted anxiety, paranoia and continued efforts to shield her children -- barring any television or Internet in the house -- she is most at peace at home. ""I feel safest at home with my kids,"" she said. ""And I want to be only there, that's my favorite time at night, in my pajamas playing Twister.""","Nadya Suleman gave birth to 8 kids in 2009, after being implanted with 12 embryos .

"(CNN) -- Two national police officers were wounded Sunday when a gunman shot at officers outside the Italian prime minister's office, authorities said. The gunman, described as a 49-year-old man, fired six shots at police before being taken into custody, said a national police officer who was not authorized to speak to the media. The officers didn't suffer life-threatening wounds, and the shooter was also hospitalized -- though not wounded, the source said. Francesco Puglisi, a journalist for Il Tempo newspaper, heard the shots from his office, then saw police tackle the man. He ran to the scene and said the face-down suspect appeared calm and was complying with police. The gunman wanted to commit suicide after the attack but ran out of bullets, Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said in a televised statement. The shooting took place in front of the prime minister's office, but Enrico Letta was being sworn in as prime minister at the time at the president's palace a short distance away, state-run news agency ANSA said. The agency also reported that prosecutor Pierfilippo Laviani said the shooter had confessed and was hoping to shoot politicians but found none so he struck out at police. Security at key government buildings was strengthened after the attack, though officials said they thought it was an isolated incident. The shooter, who is unemployed, lives in the southern region of Calabria, officials said. On Saturday, Letta, a center-left politician, accepted a mandate to form a government from President Giorgio Napolitano. The 46-year-old former deputy prime minister and his ministers were sworn in Sunday, and parliament is expected to confirm his government through a vote of confidence Monday. Letta's acceptance of the leadership role is expected to limit the uncertainty that has gripped the nation since February when elections left none of the candidates with enough support to form a government. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Letta a trusted friend of Washington. ""We wish him the best as he promotes reform at home and ensures continued Italian leadership abroad, and we look forward to continuing our close cooperation with Italy on many pressing issues all over the world,"" Kerry said.","NEW: U.S. sends congratulations to new prime minister .

"(CNN) -- Armed militants took over three police camps Saturday in northern Kenya, a siege that prompted a significant response by local and national authorities, a Kenyan agency said. The attack was centered in the village of Lorokon in Turkana County, which borders Uganda to the west, South Sudan to the north and a sliver of Ethiopia to the northeast. Kenya's National Disaster Operation Centre tweeted that the siege comes on the heels of a border dispute between the Turkana and Pokot peoples. ""(Authorities) are combating the bandits in Turkana, but there is heavy resistance,"" the agency tweeted Saturday evening. The Disaster Operation Centre followed up about two hours later by noting Kenya's Ministry of the Interior is coordinating the response, working in conjunction with local police officers and reservists. Kenyan police were moved to the area ""to combat the banditry and to reopen"" a key road in the area. Efforts were also under way to work with leaders in both West Pokot and Turkana ""to resolve the border dispute in Lorokon,"" the national agency said. A curfew was established Saturday night in parts of both these counties.","The militia take over camps in Lorokon in northern Kenya's Turkana county .

"(CNN) -- Sarin gas has been used several times in the Syrian civil war, including at least once by the Assad regime, France's foreign minister said Tuesday, citing results from test samples in France's possession. Laurent Fabius announced that conclusion after meeting with the head of a United Nations mission set up to establish the facts about the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria. ""I gave him the results of tests carried out by our lab appointed by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to identify chemical warfare,"" Fabius said in a statement, referring to the Swedish scientist Professor Ake Sellstrom. ""These results show the presence of sarin in the samples that are in our possession,"" Fabius said. ""In view of these elements, France now has the certainty that the sarin gas was used in Syria several times and in a localized manner."" In an interview later Tuesday with CNN affiliate France 2, Fabius blamed the Syrian government in at least one of the cases. ""There is no doubt that it is the regime and its accomplices,"" Fabius said. He added the French government examined the chain of events from the moment of the attack through the lab results to determine that government was responsible. Fabius' announcement did not say when or where the weapons may have been used or who may have used the gas in the other cases. Syrian rebels have been fighting the government for more than two years. Atrocities have been blamed on both sides. The announcement coincided with the release of a draft report posted on the website of the U.N. Human Rights Council that concludes: ""There are reasonable grounds to believe that chemical agents have been used as weapons. The precise agents, delivery systems or perpetrators could not be identified."" In Washington, White House press secretary Jay Carney said the United States was working with the French and other allies as well as the Syrian opposition to determine those answers. ""We need to expand the evidence we have,"" he told reporters Tuesday. ""We need to make it reviewable; we need to have it corroborated before we make any decisions based on the clear violation that use of chemical weapons would represent by the Syrian regime. So, we will continue in that effort."" Asked how long that might take, he said, ""I don't have a timetable for you."" He noted that Damascus has consistently turned down U.S. requests for a U.N. investigative team to be sent to Syria. ""But we are not relying on the United Nations alone,"" he said. ""We are aggressively pursuing other avenues to gather the evidence that is required."" Earlier this year, the United States said its intelligence analysts had concluded ""with varying degrees of confidence"" that chemical weapons had been used in Syria. But President Barack Obama said ""intelligence assessments alone are not sufficient."" In early May, the head of the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said that evidence points to the use of sarin by Syrian rebel forces. But the commission later issued a news release saying it ""has not reached conclusive findings as to the use of chemical weapons in Syria by any parties to the conflict."" In April, the head of the Israeli military's intelligence research said the Syrian government is using chemical weapons against rebel forces.

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's foreign minister is calling for reform of the United Nations Security Council following the ""extrajudicial"" killing of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. NATO's role in Libya highlights the need for more democracy and accountability, Simbarashe Mumbengegwi said late Tuesday at a celebration to mark the anniversary of the United Nations. Gadhafi's ""brutal extrajudicial killing"" shows the Security Council is not accountable to member states of the U.N. General Assembly , he said. The former leader was fatally shot last week after he was captured in his hometown of Sirte following months of protests calling for his ouster. ""The past nine months (in Libya) have demonstrated how a few countries ... can easily treat the Security Council and its resolutions with utter contempt and render that important organ of the United Nations most impotent,"" he said. ""Although other important members of the Security Council protested at the abuse of UNSC Resolution 1973, they could do nothing to stop the abuse since any effort to do so would have been vetoed by those in NATO who wield the veto power."" The resolution calls for NATO to ""take all necessary measures"" -- without using an occupation force -- to protect civilians and population centers under the threat of attack in Libya.","NATO's role in Libya highlights the need for more democracy and accountability, he says .

"(CNN) -- Even if Olafur Stefansson dressed up as Santa Claus this Christmas, he would still have one of the most recognizable faces in Iceland. He may not rival Bjork when it comes to fame on the international stage but, just like the singing icon, he is a big name in Iceland's popular culture. Stefansson is a handball hero -- and handball is the second-most popular sport in Iceland after soccer. When the Iceland men's team matches are televised, a whopping 80% of the Nordic island's population of 322,000 tunes in. With that kind of coverage alone, it's no wonder Stefansson is a household name, but that's not all. An Olympic silver medalist and four times voted Iceland's sports personality of the year, at his peak he was rated as one of the best players in the global game. After more than 20 years at the top, Stefansson retired in 2013 and is now handing down his knowledge to the next generation of Icelandic handball hopefuls. The 40-year-old has come home to the capital city of Reykjavik to coach a group of young athletes at the Valur club, where his own career began. ""It's full circle,"" ponders Stefansson, who now distinguishes himself from the players buzzing around him by donning a fluorescent coaching bib and yellow whistle. ""It's one thing being a player and another being a coach. ""As a player, if I was not in the mood I could just do my thing 100%, didn't have to relate to the guys or anything. ""As a coach you don't have that option. You have to vibrate, you have to be happier than those guys, you have to show passion, show urgency, show that you believe in what you're doing. ""It's a great thing -- it takes you further as a person."" Stefansson, who represented Iceland in 330 matches, wants to ingrain a similar understanding of going beyond the boundaries to his Valur charges. The wooden floors of the handball court spring with a squeak as the players move through the technical drills and handball skills that Stefansson describes as a player's arsenal, but he is trying to teach them something more esoteric. ""What I'm focusing on -- and what is usually the most neglected factor in all team sports -- is the sense of the game,"" he told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""You have to decide in split seconds between maybe five possibilities, and so you have to choose the best one. ""If you have this skill, then you have everything."" This sixth sense on the court only comes through learned experience. Like most children in Iceland, Stefansson started playing handball at school, but even then he had his own spin on the game. ""Me and my best friend, we just put our socks together and made a ball out of it,"" he explained. ""One of us stood in the doorway -- and that was the goal -- while the other one tried to score."" Stefansson squeezed in as much practice as he could, counting down his remaining time to play with the chimes of the bells from the church next door to his school. But it was while at university that he made the switch from a vocational career in medicine to becoming a full-time student of the game. ""The national team was really strong in Iceland and they needed a left-handed player,"" Stefansson explained. ""So, I took it on. ""The best thing that happened to me was that I didn't get through medicine the first time, so I had all spring to train like a professional. That happened twice -- those were the best springs of my life! ""Then I studied philosophy, just went on some courses and trained for handball like never before. ""After that, I got offers to play abroad. Met some good characters, met some bad, but from everybody I learned something."" Stefansson's international career took him to European and World championships as well as three Olympic Games. He also spent 17 years on the road as a peripatetic player for leading clubs in Denmark, Germany, Spain and, most recently, Qatar. Along the way, he amassed a series of domestic and five European club titles but each destination also provided new opportunities to learn. He described his six months living in Qatar, as the first international player to stay in the Arab state on a long-term deal, as ""a great time."" ""There were some restrictions. Great extremes between rich and poor, but they are great people,"" he said. ""I also picked up the language. I had to drive an hour every day to training so I had (a CD) of Arabic in my ears."" There was also an enduring lesson to be learned at his debut Olympic Games in Athens, where the Icelandic men's team failed to get out of the initial group stages. ""We didn't have much chance,"" Stefansson recalled. ""But I took it all the way, I dreamed about the medal, I wrote down before and after games things that I should have done better. ""We finished ninth but in having done that, I had all those sketches in diaries. When I came back four years later I knew what I had done wrong and what not."" In 2008, Stefansson was captain of Iceland for the Beijing Olympics and he led the team to a brilliant silver medal. France snatched gold by six points in the final. ""We won the silver so that was great,"" he said. ""Then in London I wanted to take it even further, so probably a month after winning the silver I started thinking about gold."" Iceland arguably had a stronger team at the 2012 London Olympics but, after tuning up with bronze at the European Championships in 2010, Stefansson's men lost to Hungary by an agonizing single point in the quarterfinals. The man they nickname ""The Falcon"" retired from the international game in June 2013, but in looking back at his career it was those lessons learned in Beijing that he draws on the most. ""The silver medal was good,"" Stefansson reflected. ""But the classic saying is that it's a road not a destination. ""What I enjoy about handball is this forgetfulness that you get in the game; you just forget yourself, your worries. ""Now I'm just trying to wake up happy every day, do some good stuff, be joyful, and affect others in a good way. ""When I achieve those states -- that would be my greatest achievement."" For now, the next part of that journey begins where it all began, with the hopeful handball players at Valur. ""It's my second home,"" smiles Stefansson, surveying the scene. ""A place full of lights, you know, and full of warmth.""","Olafur Stefansson is regarded as Iceland's most famous handball player .

"(CNN) -- The shooting of an unarmed and naked Alabama university student killed in a late-night confrontation with a campus police officer appears to be unjustified, the lawyer for the young man's family said Thursday. Part of the brief incident Saturday night that led to the death of 18-year-old Gilbert Thomas Collar of Wetumpka, Alabama, was captured on a surveillance camera outside the University of South Alabama police station. The video has not yet been viewed by reporters or the public, but the Collar family's attorney, Jere Beasley, said, ""There is nothing on the surveillance tape that justifies the use of deadly force."" Mobile County Sheriff Sam Cochran said Tuesday that Collar, naked, sweating profusely and acting erratically, showed up at the police station and began banging on the door and window. An officer came out, his handgun drawn, and started issuing orders to Collar while retreating backward across the back patio of the building, according to Cochran. After retreating for more than 100 feet, according to Cochran, the officer fired when Collar drew within five feet of him. Collar, struck once in the chest, collapsed and died at the scene. The incident unfolded over no more than 20 or 30 seconds, Beasley said. While Cochran said the police investigation into the shooting continues, Beasley said he questioned why the officer did not wait until backup arrived to engage Collar, who had no history of violence or drug use. He also questioned why the officer did not use either pepper spray or a baton in an effort to subdue Collar. The officer had access to both pepper spray and a baton, Beasley said, but he noted that campus police are apparently not certified to use stun guns. ""Had either a stun gun, baton or pepper spray been used in this case, we wouldn't be here today,"" he said. Both Beasley and sheriff's investigators believe someone gave a substance to Collar that led to his erratic behavior. At Tuesday's news conference, Cochran said witnesses told police someone had given Collar LSD sometime during the night. Beasley said it would be irresponsible to say Collar was on drugs until toxicology results are completed, which could take several weeks. He also said he doubted witness statements to police that Collar attacked occupants of two cars before reaching the police station. Cochran said Tuesday that a witness interviewed by police took a picture of Collar against the side of one car. ""One victim had advised that he had grabbed her arm and was trying to bite her on the arm and making weird noises and statements towards this victim,"" he said. Beasley said state Rep. Barry Mask, R-Wetumpka, will ask Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley and Attorney General Luther Strange to launch a review of training and equipment standards for university police departments statewide. Mask did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The death has, of course, been hard on Collar's family, Beasley said. But he added they have forgiven the officer who fired the fatal shot, and are praying for him. The family will wait for the results of investigations before deciding whether to file a lawsuit against the school, Beasley said. ""The goal of the parents is to make sure that this does not happen again to any other student under like or similar circumstances,"" he said.","The shooting of an Alabama student appears unjustified, the family's lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- Two years after the end of the Iraq war, the U.S. State Department confirmed this week that it is providing the fragile country with sophisticated weapons and drones. Iraq needs help fighting against a growing and serious threat -- al Qaeda. For those who don't avidly follow the complicated machinations of the globe's top terror group, this could be confusing. Hasn't the line for years from the U.S. government and its allies been that al Qaeda is on the run, that its fiercest fighting ability has been weakened by U.S. strikes? That truth is far more complex, of course. The terror group's manpower has increased in recent years, it has gained control of more territory in North Africa and the Middle East and is taking a different approach to death, according to top lawmakers privy to high-level intelligence and experts who have observed al Qaeda's activities since September 11. A stake in Yemen . While al Qaeda suffered significant setbacks after Navy SEALs shot and killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, and drone strikes have taken out top terrorists along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, the terror group and its close allies have rebounded in Yemen, the Sinai region of Egypt, Libya, Iraq, and parts of east and west Africa, among other places. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, headquartered in Yemen, is particularly concerning. CNN has learned of recent intercepts of messages among senior al Qaeda operatives in Yemen, but the messages don't name specific targets. One source told CNN that the chatter suggested ""active plotting."" ""There are multiple indications that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is plotting attacks both within Yemen, against U.S. and Western structures and overseas,"" said Seth Jones, an analyst at Rand Corp. The Yemeni group is already notorious for sending an operative on board a flight into the United States on Christmas day in 2009 with explosives in his underwear. Al Qaeda in Yemen ""are still capable of conducting attacks"" and particularly adept at ""taking down aircraft,"" Jones said. Al Qaeda: We're sorry about Yemen hospital attack . The U.S. has been fighting back, but not every strike has been successful. This month a drone failed to kill an al Qaeda planner believed to be behind a plot to attack the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa. Instead, the drone hit a wedding party, Yemeni officials said. A powder keg in Syria . Al Qaeda-linked militants have established a formidable foothold in the complicated civil war in Syria. There are up to 11,000 foreign fighters from 74 nations in the conflict that has raged since April 2011, according to the December report from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalism (ICSR). The majority have traveled from other Arab countries, creating a significant risk of blowback when these fighters return home. ""The concern is that the al Qaeda networks of the future are being created in this jihadist melting pot,"" said Paul Cruickshank, a CNN terrorism analyst who has specialized for years in studying al Qaeda. READ MORE: Cruickshank: Concerns over al Qaeda's resurgence . An increasing number of them are from Europe -- approaching two thousand, according to the ICSR, an unprecedented number, according to experts. The United States and its allies fear that those fighters will be able to more easily launch attacks in their homelands or against Western targets, said Cruickshank. ""Syria is now the fuel for the jihadist movement and some of the most experienced operatives from Pakistan and Iraq have relocated there,"" he said. ""Syria has helped al Qaeda rebuild its operations in the Arab world, which has always been its intention anyway."" READ MORE: Al Qaeda-linked group strengthens hold in northern Syria . Cruickshank saiid it's especially scary to consider that al Qaeda members in Syria could receive training in the terror group's traditionally sophisticated bomb-making and detonating courses. Consider that the Boston Marathon bombing utilized what are considered low-grade explosives, he said. Al Qaeda generally sets the bar higher for destruction on par with the London attacks in the summer of 2005. ""It's possible that new recruits could get training like what we saw al Qaeda in Pakistan giving -- showing people how to make high-explosive bombs made of chemicals bought at beauty or home goods stores and detonate them."" Cruickshank said. ""All they would need to do is return to Europe, buy what they need to and carry out an attack."" Flashpoint partners, a U.S outfit that tracks jihadist websites, provided the terror analyst with an al Qaeda video that emerged on Christmas day. It features the Boston bombing and also the slaying of a London soldier in May of this year. The Christmas Day-published video is an updated English language version of al Qaeda's central video ""You are Only Responsible for Yourself"" which was first issued in June 2011. That video featured senior al Qaeda leaders including Ayman al Zawahiri and American-born al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn. It calls for al Qaeda sympathizers to take things into their own hands and launch attacks in the West. Both attacks are called models for the future. An elusive peace in Iraq . Syria borders Iraq. Though the causes of violence in Iraq are many-fold, al Qaeda's presence there, aided by Syria's weakened state, is being felt among the fragile nation's law enforcement and civilian population. Between January and November 2013, more than 7,000 Iraqi civilians were killed, including 952 Iraqi Security Forces, according to the United Nations. April 2013 was Iraq's deadliest month in five years. Since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Sunni Arabs have been politically marginalized and Shiites, who represent a majority of Iraqis, have emerged with more power. That has led to sectarian violence -- constant bombings and various smaller attacks. Al Qaeda is targeting Shiites in an attempt to plunge the country into another civil war and hopes to carve out a larger zone of territory under their control on either side of the Syria-Iraq border, Cruickshank says. Smaller bursts of violence are the hallmark of al Qaeda's new approach to terrorism, according to the chairs of the Senate and House intelligence committees who appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union"" in early December. CNN's Candy Crowley asked House Intelligence Committee Chair Mike Rogers if he thought Americans were safer in 2013 than they were a few years ago. He insisted they're not, and that U.S. intelligence and security officials are having a tougher time than ever before trying to stop so many smaller-scale plots. But does that translate into a threat specifically in the U.S.? To Rogers, it does. ""All of them have at least some aspiration to commit an act of violence in the United States or against Western targets all around the world,"" he said. However, CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen said earlier this month that the data on al Qaeda-linked or influenced militants indicted in the United States suggests that the threat of terrorism has actually markedly declined over the past couple of years. At least for the moment, ""these al Qaeda groups in Syria and Iraq are completely focused on overthrowing the Assad regime (in Syria) or attacking what they regard as the Shia-dominated government of Iraq. And, at least so far, these groups have shown no ability to attack in Europe, let alone in the United States,"" he said in a column published on CNN.com. Bergen: Are we hyping the terror risk? The new Al Qaeda . What motivates al Qaeda's newest members? Sen. Dianne Feinstein told Crowley she thought there is still a pervasive belief among extremists that a caliphate -- an Islamic state governed strictly by Sharia, or Islamic, law -- is possible and should be fought for. ""I think there is a real displaced aggression in this very fundamentalist, jihadist, Islamic community,"" she said. ""And that is that the west is responsible for everything that goes wrong...I see more groups, more fundamentalists, more jihadists more determined to kill to get to where they want to get."" Cruickshank points to the disappointment many young men felt over what they perceive as a failed Arab Spring revolution. (Al Qaeda is still mostly comprised of younger men, though women are taking backseat support roles, he added.) In 2011, tens of thousands of protesters staged a revolution in Egypt that unseated longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak. Mohamed Morsy, then a Muslim Brotherhood leader, was elected president in the country's first democratic election in 2012. He was deposed by the military last summer. This week Egypt's military-backed government declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group. On Thursday, dozens of members of the Islamist party were arrested and their property seized, authorities said. ""The great hope of the Arab Spring was that it would liberate the political system. But instead it resulted in increased repression against Islamists,"" Cruickshank said. ""For a lot of young men going into Syria, in some respect, it's a reaction to that feeling."" ""They see the Egyptian and Syrian government as tarred with the same brush. They see those governments as blocking the true flourishing of Islam."" CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Al Qaeda rebounds in Yemen, Egypt's Sinai region, Libya, Iraq, east and west Africa .

"Nogales, Mexico (CNN) -- Inside a Mexican jail, Yanira Maldonado wept. A devout Mormon, the Arizona mother of seven said Wednesday she's been turning to scripture to survive ever since authorities falsely accused her of drug smuggling last week. ""Reading the scriptures, reading the Book of Mormon, praying, fasting,"" Maldonado told CNN. ""And all the support that I've been getting from my family, my husband, my children, and everybody out there reaching out to help."" A judge is weighing whether to set Maldonado free after authorities accused her of drug smuggling and alleged they found 12 pounds of marijuana under her bus seat. Maldonado maintained her innocence Wednesday. ""I'm a good mom. I love the gospel. I'm LDS. And we work hard to have what we have,"" she said. ""You know, we're not rich, but we're very honest and we always do our best to help other people."" The Mexican military officials who arrested Maldonado haven't made their case yet in court. The soldiers were scheduled to appear Wednesday, but didn't show, according to a defense attorney. Hearings in the case are set to continue Friday. Maldonado's family denies the charges and says they're optimistic the case against her is crumbling. ""We have high hopes,"" Anna Soto, Maldonado's daughter, told CNN on Wednesday. ""So I'm just looking forward to that. Hopefully, Friday, I'm praying that she will be home and be set free."" It's a situation Maldonado said she never imagined when she boarded a bus last week to head back to the United States after attending her aunt's funeral in Mexico. ""I was at the checkpoint. They asked us to get off bus. And they were checking for drugs or I don't know what else,"" she said. ""And they say they found something under my seat. But I never saw anything. They didn't show me anything. It was just amazing all that, what they did."" Fearing for her life . Earlier this week, Maldonado's cuffed hands gripped a metal bar as a truck carrying her to testify barreled down the street. One thought went through her mind, she told CNN, crying as she recalled her fear that the fast-moving Mexican police convoy would crash. ""I'm not a killer. I'm not a criminal. I'm just here by mistake because people are not doing their work,"" she said. ""This is not right. I need to be back with my family. I need to be out of here. I need help."" Since her arrest, Maldonado said her views toward the country where she was born have changed drastically. Asked before by friends about going south of the border, Maldonado never thought twice when she gave advice. ""I used to tell people, 'Come to Mexico. It's not true what they're saying. I go every year to visit my family. ... I come, I drive myself, nothing happens.' ... Look what's happening to me now. I cannot say that anymore,"" Maldonado told CNN. ""I don't want anybody to go through this."" If she's released from prison, Maldonado says she's not sure whether she'll ever return to Mexico. From a bus seat to a jail cell . Mexican authorities arrested Maldonado last Wednesday as she and her husband, Gary, were on their way back to Arizona. Gary Maldonado said he believes Mexican soldiers at the checkpoint wanted a bribe. A Mexican state official also told CNN it appears that Maldonado was framed. Another daughter, Brenda Pedraza, called the arrest ""outrageous."" Her mother was recently by her side, she said, cradling her newborn granddaughter. ""She's just a wonderful mom and a wonderful grandma and she would never jeopardize her life to lose this, to lose her family,"" she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday. The family relies on Maldonado and misses her, Pedraza said. ""I still need her, you know, being a new mom. I still need her advice, her guidance. We've heard that the minimum is 10 years. Ten years is a whole lifespan. We don't have that time, 10 years, to be separated,"" Pedraza said, choking back tears. ""Please, to the officials in Mexico, please do your part and really investigate, because I know my mom has nothing to do with those illegal drugs."" After testifying in court on Tuesday, Gary Maldonado told CNN affiliate KTVK that he was feeling optimistic. ""We're hoping for the best outcome. ... We don't think they have a case,"" he said. The Mexican Embassy in Washington said in a statement that a preliminary decision from the judge was expected soon. Questions about arrest . A Sonora state official with extensive knowledge of the case told CNN there are questions about the arrest. ""Can you imagine?"" asked the official, who was not authorized to speak to the media and did not want to be named. ""A passenger by himself or herself would have been unable to carry almost six kilos of marijuana onto a bus without being noticed. She must've been framed."" A regional office of Mexico's Defense Ministry said troops conducting a routine investigation stopped the bus Maldonado was riding in and and found 12.5 pounds (5.7 kilograms) of a substance that appeared to be marijuana under her seat. Troops turned the case over to the Mexican attorney general's office, the defense ministry said. Maldonado is being housed in a women's prison in Nogales while authorities decide her fate. The Sonora state division of the attorney general's office said the investigation is ongoing and declined to provide additional information. Her husband was told by authorities that regardless of his wife's guilt or innocence, he would have to pay $5,000 to secure her freedom, the family said. He was able to cobble together the money but then was told it was too late. His wife had been transferred to another jail. U.S. officials monitoring the case . Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, is monitoring the case, his office said. The State Department has also been in touch with the family. ""The U.S. Consulate in Nogales is monitoring the case closely,"" State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki told reporters on Wednesday. ""They are in regular contact with Ms. Maldonado and her family, and her legal counsel, and they're working to schedule another visit with her. The last time we were able to visit with her was May 24."" The State Department estimates that several thousand U.S. citizens are arrested in Mexico each year. But it's unclear exactly how many U.S. citizens have been detained in Mexico, the State Department said. ""We don't have the exact breakdown for Mexico, and the embassy would not have that information either,"" said Elizabeth A. Finan, a spokeswoman for the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affiairs. ""However, I can say millions of U.S. citizens travel to Mexico each year, and most have uneventful trips. Arrests happen every day, as you might expect with such a high volume of visitors."" Some arrests go unreported to U.S. officials, and sometimes arrested individuals do not request consular assistance, Finan wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""Arrest cases are not uncommon in Mexico,"" she said, ""and our consular officers work hard to assist all U.S. citizens who come to us for help.""

"(CNN) -- I'm a big fan of Michelle Obama's, but if she's going to be hitting the circuit to raise money for Democrats, she has to be prepared for heckling. Especially heckling from gay rights activists like the one who interrupted her speech Tuesday night. ""Lesbian looking for federal equality before I die."" That's how Ellen Sturtz, the woman identified as the heckler, identified herself. Apparently the first lady's husband said something about signing an executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Sturtz had the nerve to ask the president to keep his word. And it's not like signing an order will rock Washington's world -- as The Washington Post pointed out, of the ""employees of federal contractors that are in the Fortune 1000, 92% are already protected by a company-wide sexual orientation nondiscrimination policy, and 58% are already protected by a gender identity nondiscrimination policy."" Still President Barack Obama made a promise: It's not unreasonable to expect him to keep it. Especially when one out of every 16 of his ""bundlers"" -- those who organize super fund-raisers -- during the 2012 election was openly gay. The Washington Post says of his top 2012 bundlers, one in six was gay. And that more than 75% of voters who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender voted for him. And yet the changes Obama has wrought since he was first elected often feel as if they're being handed out like doggie treats, and not championed with the same urgency that Democrats showed on the campaign trail. Heckling the first lady wasn't fair because she isn't responsible for policy. But the incident sent a message to those who are responsible: We are people, not pawns. But this is what happens when a bloc of voters -- be it the LGBT community, Latinos, women -- surrenders its voting power to a political party as opposed to a principle. Not all Republicans are anti-gay, not all Democrats are pro, and it's the rare politician who will do something ""bold"" that isn't politically expedient. In Illinois, the House of Representatives, controlled 71-47 by Democrats, chose not to vote on same-sex marriage legislation, with some members saying they needed to talk it over with their constituents. A rationale that doesn't hold much water because the Senate passed the bill 34-21 in February. State Sen. Jason Barickman, a Republican, voted in support of same-sex marriage after adding a religious liberty amendment to the bill. Many activists are pointing fingers at the Illinois House Legislative Black Caucus for not playing ball. This seems ironic, considering the first item under the subject line ""What Are They Fighting for?"" is civil equality. State Rep. Ken Dunkin, chairman of the Black Caucus, did not return my calls. But he did tell the Windy City Times that it was unfair to pin the bill's failure on the caucus, adding, ""This is not the Black Caucus' burden."" Because lord knows black folks have nothing to do with gay folks, right Ken? Gregory Angelo, the Log Cabin Republicans' national executive director, told me that ""if there's any lesson to learn from this is that Democrats can't pass marriage equality on their own. They need Republican support."" And the LGBT community would be wise to remember that. The Republican Party may house the most vocal, and sometimes offensive, opponents -- but that doesn't mean that all Democrats are proponents or courageous enough to fight. The Senate Republicans in Rhode Island became the first legislative caucus in the country, of either party, to vote unanimously for same-sex marriage. The truth is the Illinois Democrats promised to bring the bill to a vote and they didn't. It's likely they are stalling to see what the U.S. Supreme Court decides in the two same-sex marriage cases it heard this spring. Decisions are expected later this month. The Illinois House has until August 31 to vote. This is a little political cover that may be smart but flies in the face of the party's national platform: ""We oppose discriminatory federal and state constitutional amendments and other attempts to deny equal protection of the laws to committed same-sex couples who seek the same respect and responsibilities as other married couples."" But Democrats have trampled on that promise before, and fairly recently. In 2009, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said he supported marriage for same-sex couples. But he recently opposed an amendment to the immigration reform bill that would have included same-sex couples because he thought it would make Republicans kill the bill. The Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee didn't even want to vote on it. Basically Schumer wants same-sex couples to get married in his home state -- but if you're binational, he'll let the government deport your spouse. So the LGBT community gets tossed under the bus -- again -- as if our families are not worth voting for. As if we don't deserve a public record of which Democrat is for us and which is against us. Heckling Mrs. Obama wasn't fair to her. But taking the LGBT community for granted isn't fair to us either. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","First lady heckled by ""lesbian looking for federal equality before I die""

"(CNN) -- Frank Welker's name may not immediately ring a bell to you, but you almost certainly know his voice. He's acted in nearly 700 films and television shows. From Fred in ""Scooby Doo"" to Ray in ""The Real Ghostbusters"" to the most recent ""Garfield"" -- if it's an animated show, there's a very good chance you'll hear Welker's work (he also specializes in animals, like ""Aladdin's"" Abu). He can currently be heard reprising his memorable role as the evil Megatron on ""Transformers Prime,"" with his old friend, Peter Cullen, who plays one of the most noble characters ever created, Optimus Prime. Cullen was also a mainstay of 1980s animation, in roles such as Venger in ""Dungeons & Dragons."" Welker and Cullen make their living as voice actors and it's not easy to forget, as the pair of them often break into voices like John Wayne, Peter Lorre and Jabberjaw, one of Welker's favorites. However, more and more A-list actors are joining the voice-over club over the last 20 years. It's even gotten to the point where Chris Rock, star of the ""Madagascar"" franchise, took the opportunity of presenting an animation Oscar to quip about how ""easy"" it is to do voice work. Rock joked that all he had to do was say the lines, ""And then they give me a million dollars."" (No less than Danny DeVito took issue with that characterization.) Voice actor Seth MacFarlane -- creator of ""Family Guy,"" ""American Dad"" and ""The Cleveland Show"" -- is enough of an A-lister to host both ""Saturday Night Live"" and next year's Oscars. So how has the world of voice acting changed since Welker and Cullen's early days (besides the fact that a show like ""Mighty Man and Yukk,"" their first job together, probably wouldn't get made today)? ""The technology has changed a lot,"" Welker told CNN. ""You see the CGI animation is so pretty and you could do a lot more with it than our old flat animation which I still like, of course. Watching those shows absolutely blows me away on an HD screen. You see so much more detail. It gives the actor more opportunity to bend your voice and be more subtle."" Cullen said, ""The respect level (for voice acting) is climbing and climbing faster than it ever did before in the last few years. The studios are recognizing they don't have to hire a big name actor. People don't know the difference in most cases. They're finding they can take a chance with talent and accomplish the same thing."" Welker also noted that the Internet has made a big difference, and made it easier for fans to follow particular voice actors. ""In the old days doing the show, we never got one piece of fan mail,"" he said. ""We had no idea there was an audience out there. The only way to tell there was some interest was if we got picked up for another season -- oh, somebody liked us."" Crispin Freeman became a voice actor in 1997, just at the time when animation attracting A-listers was going strong. He's best known for his work dubbing Japanese anime like ""Howl's Moving Castle"" and most recently Cartoon Network's ""Young Justice."" Cartoon Network is owned CNN's parent company. ""Voice actors have always been quite popular in Japan, but American culture is now becoming more aware of the artistic contribution of voice actors because of the swell in popularity of video games and animated films,"" he said. ""Not only have both mediums been expanding their market penetration in America in recent years, but the maturity of the storytelling in each medium has grown as well,"" Freeman said. ""This attracts an older audience that is more curious about the performers behind their favorite animation or video game character. It seems that as we see a convergence of film, animation and video games, American audiences will become more and more aware of the importance of voice acting."" Patrick Seitz has a slightly different perspective. He got into voicing even more recently, in 2000, and is mostly involved with the world of video game voice work, as well as anime. ""I don't know if voice acting is more respected, per se, but I do think it's a higher profile pursuit than it was in decades past,"" he said. ""Games progressing to the point where they can be fully voiced has opened a whole new sphere of awareness and fandom, and ever since the animated feature films got the idea to fill their casts with celebrities (for better or for worse), they've never looked back."" But he certainly agrees with Cullen and Welker that online fandom for voice actors has been a game changer. ""It's amazing how completely some of the fans have sussed out our vocal fingerprint, so to speak. I've had folks identify me based on nothing more than a roar.""","You may not recognize their faces, but some voice actors are working steadily .
One of the most famous, Seth MacFarlane recently hosted ""Saturday Night Live""
Actors say the Internet has helped to grow their fan base ."
