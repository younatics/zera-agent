Dentist Joyce Trail, 51, who was jailed for conning the NHS out of nearly £1.4million, must pay it all back, a judge has ruled . A dentist jailed after she made more than £1million by fraudulently claiming for dental work on the NHS has been ordered to pay the whole lot back by a judge. Joyce Trail, 51, from Sutton Coldfield, had submitted 100 claims for patients who were dead, and triple-claimed for others during a scam netting her £1,376,423.80 from 7,141 fraudulent claims. She then splashed out on designer shoes and clothes, luxury homes, £1,000-a-night hotel suites in the Caribbean and America, and private schooling for her granddaughters. Now, however, the conwoman has been told she must pay the proceeds of what was one of the biggest frauds in the history of the NHS back. Trail, who was jailed for six and a half years in October 2012, must start her repayments to the NHS by handing over £358,281.87 within 18 months to the NHS. At a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing at Warwick Crown Court yesterday, Judge Peter Carr made a compensation order for £1,376,423.80, meaning any assets Trail has now or in the future may be seized by the NHS. And he ordered that she repay £358,281.87 of it within 18 months. Prosecutor Miranda Moore QC told the court that the money was to be paid 'as part of a compensation order to the NHS who were the losers to the tune of just under £1.37million.' Sue Frith, head of the National Investigation Service at NHS Protect, said after the case: 'This is the sort of outcome the public wish to see. We will always seek to recover lost NHS funds. 'NHS Protect and other agencies will do all we can to recoup as much of the loss as possible so it can be spent properly, on caring for NHS patients'. During her trial at Birmingham Crown Court, it emerged that Trail, from Little Aston in the West Midlands, submitted more than 7,000 claims for work on patients she had not treated over a three-year period from March 2006. Life of luxury: The dentist conwoman had to swap her spacious house in the West Midlands for a jail cell . Practice: Trail, who is a grandmother, worked out of Medical Spa Studios in Handsworth, Birmingham . Ill-gotten gains: Trail spent the money she swindled on vast amounts of designer shoes and clothes . She claimed for providing and fitting dentures for patients who were not entitled to have NHS treatment paid for, as well as those who didn't need dentures and those who were dead. During the trial, the court heard how Trail, who worked out of Medical Spa studios in Handsworth, Birmingham, had a taste for expensive holidays and Jimmy Choo shoes, and used the money she had fraudulently gleaned to lead a lavish lifestyle. The judge told the jury that the dentist's collection of expensive Jimmy Choos 'would make Imelda Marcos proud', and said that Trail acted 'out of pure greed'. The case was described as one of the most complex taken on by West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service. Police investigating Trail's complex fraud found designer jewellery and watches at her home in Sutton Coldfield . Last October, Trail was struck off by the General Dental Council and is set to lose her NHS pension. A spokesman said: 'The gravity of Trail’s convictions offended fundamental standards of behaviour expected of a member of the dental profession. 'Her convictions go to her character and her actions are incapable of remedy. She has brought the profession into disrepute and remains subject to the lengthy custodial sentences imposed upon her by the court.'","Joyce Trail, 51, from Sutton Coldfield, was jailed in 2012 for claim fraud .

Marion Thorpe – the former wife of the Queen’s cousin, the Earl of Harewood, and the current wife of ex-Liberal Party leader Jeremy Thorpe – has died aged 87. Vienna-born Marion, who was fiercely loyal to her scandal-hit second husband during his trial for attempted murder, passed away on March 6. She stood by her politician husband when he became the centre of a scandal which rocked the nation in 1971 after former male model Norman Scott claimed the pair had enjoyed a homosexual relationship ten years previously when such acts were illegal. Marion Thorpe, who was first married to the Queen's cousin, the Earl of Harewood, before marrying former Liberal Party leader Jeremy Thorpe, has died aged 87 . An internal party inquiry exonerated Mr Thorpe, but in 1976, the case hit the headlines once again when Mr Scott claimed the politician had conspired to have him killed. Mr Scott, who was befriended by an airline pilot called Andrew Newton, claimed Newton tried to kill him on Exmoor, Devon. As a result, Mr Thorpe was sensationally arrested and charged with attempted murder and conspiracy to murder at Minehead Police Station in 1978. According to the prosecution, the Liberal leader had diverted money from party donors and arranged through a bizarre series of intermediaries — including a Welsh fruit-machine magnate and a cut-price carpet dealer — for Newton to murder his former lover. When the case came to court a year later, Thorpe denied everything. After a notorious summing up by Mr Justice Cantley, who denounced Scott as a crook and a liar, the jury found Thorpe not guilty. Marion supported her husband loyally throughout the ordeal and attended court every day to be by his side. The couple, who owned a large 16th century house set in 1.5 acres of land in rural North Devon as well as a home in London, ducked out of the limelight following the scandal. Loyal Marion Thorpe fully supported her second husband Jeremy Thorpe throughout his attempted murder trial. He was found not guilty by the jury in 1978 . Marion, pictured at an Opera Ball at The Dorchester, was married to the Queen's cousin - the Earl of Harewood . Marion's first husband - the Earl of Harewood - was 11th in line to the throne. They married in September 1949 . The Earl of Harewood and Marion Stein married in September 1949, pictured. The wedding ceremony was attended by several members of the Royal Family and around 900 people attended the reception . After her divorce from the Earl of Harewood, Marion married ex-Liberal Party leader Jeremy Thorpe, above . Marion Thorpe, who was born in Vienna to musician Erwin Stein, was an acclaimed concert pianist who was great friends with composer Benjamin Britten . Prior to her marriage to Thorpe, acclaimed concert pianist Marion spent 18 years married to the Queen’s cousin, the Earl of Harewood. The wedding ceremony, held at St Mark's Church, North Audley Street, London, in September 1949, was attended by several members of the Royal Family. Around 900 guests attended the reception at St James’s Palace and more than 500 policemen were drafted in for security. Marion Thorpe, pictured leaving the Old Bailey, supported her second husband Jeremy Thorpe throughout his trial . Marion, who was born Maria Donata Nanetta Paulina Gustava Erwina Wilhelmine Stein in October 18 1926 to prominent Jewish musician Erwin Stein, grew up with a love of music. During her early years she became close friends with composer Benjamin Britten after being introduced to her father. She said: ‘I was impressed but my father knew a lot of musicians. I was quite spoilt by knowing people of distinction.’ In a rare interview with BBC Radio 3 last year, Marion described her great friendship with the musical creator. She said: ‘My friendship with him did last a long time… it was marvellous. I don't know what I did right! ‘I was never frightened of Ben but I had great respect for him. He was a very easy person to get on with but you were careful about what you said about works he either liked or disliked, or his own works. You chose your words carefully.’ When a house fire left Marion and her parents homeless in 1944, Britten and his partner Peter Pears welcomed them into their flat in London where they stayed for two years. She said: ‘I really got to know him well. At that time we shared an apartment on St John's Wood high street, my parents and I, Ben and Peter Pears. It was exciting as he played bits of it and we sang parts in bad voices. ‘We played [piano] duets together quite often, Peter and my father, me and Ben in various combinations, four-handed. It could be quite frightening. ‘I thought he was a great composer… all the other composers were rather jealous of him. I was his great champion.’ Marion, pictured with Jeremy, who she supported throughout the scandal which ended his career.

Second chance: A homeless immigrant who refused a council flat in this block because it was too small and too high up has won a High Court battle . A homeless Somalian refugee who refused a high-rise council flat because she is scared of heights and 'it was too small' has won a High Court battle. Naima Mohamoud took legal action after Birmingham City Council refused to offer her an alternative. A Midlands county court had backed the local authority but today the Court of Appeal ruled in Ms Mohamoud's favour after senior judges agreed she was 'confused about the system'. The mother-of-one, who speaks little English, claimed she had not realised that the offer of the flat in Cadbury House, Birmingham, was final and had thought that she would have other options. Appeal judges - who analysed the case at a hearing in London - concluded that she might have been confused and said the council should review her case. A refugee took a council to the High Court when she turned down their offer of a high rise council house claiming she was scared of heights. Somalian Naima Mohamoud claims she is separated from her husband and said she was thrown out of friend’s house when she told them she was due to give birth. She applied for council accommodation and signed a form agreeing that if she refused an offer of a home she would not get another. Ms Mahamoud was given the chance to move into a tower block, by Birmingham City Council. But she refused saying ‘it was too small, she was frightened of heights and she did not want to live in a high rise flat,’ case papers revealed. Ms Mohamoud had no idea she was effectively opting out of a property but the council said they had discharged their duty. Ms Mohamoud was left her to fend for herself and her unborn baby. She claimed that despite barely speaking English, a council employee recorded she did not require an interpreter and she did not understand the procedure. Miss Mohamoud later signed a sheet, which said, ‘I understand that if I refuse an offer of any type in any area of the City, that is suitable to my needs as defined by strict legislation, I will not receive a further offer’. Legal fight: Birmingham City Council (pictured) officials had said Naima Mohamoud was warned that refusing housing could lead to her losing out completely but senior judges said today that she was 'confused' Today the Court of Appeal upheld her challenge against the council not to offer her another home, but she was still left without the guarantee of a home. ‘The challenge is made on the basis that Ms Mohamoud’s confusion led her to refuse the offer of accommodation in circumstances where, if she had understood the true position, she would have accepted it’, Lord Justice Moore-Bick said, sitting with Lord Justice McFarlane and Mrs Justice Proudman. ‘It is hard to see how the Council could have made it clearer that only one offer would be made. ‘However I can understand how someone, either reading the letter cursorily or not fully understanding it, might find the bidding process confusing’, the judges said. ‘It may be the case that Ms Mohamoud was confused about the system. ‘I would only add that Ms Mohamoud should not take this judgment as meaning that she will inevitably receive another offer of accommodation'.","Naima Mohamoud refused home because it was too high and too small .

A former detective facing investigation over alleged corruption in the Stephen Lawrence inquiry has boasted ‘They’ll never lay a finger on me’, it was claimed yesterday. John Davidson has run the Smugglers restaurant in the Spanish holiday island of Minorca for 15 years since taking early retirement from the Metropolitan Police. The ex-detective sergeant also owns a flat above the restaurant and a nearby villa with a pool two minutes from the beach, as well as a holiday home in Florida, locals say. Davidson is expected to be questioned by police over claims he helped shield Stephen’s killers following a damning official report into the teenager’s murder by barrister Mark Ellison QC. But the Glasgow-born 68-year-old, who was nicknamed OJ for ‘Obnoxious Jock’ during his time on the Met, has told fellow expats in Minorca he has no fears about his past. One neighbour said: ‘He is very sure of himself and very cocky. He struts around like he runs the island. He really fancies himself as the big man. ‘People know about his history with the Lawrence case and have confronted him. He tells them, “They’ll never lay a finger on me. I’ve done nothing wrong. They’ve got nothing to do me for”. He acts completely unconcerned. ‘He has a few friends but many people find him too overbearing, though people are anxious about speaking out because they think he is well connected.’ Davidson, a father of two, moved to Minorca with Evelyn, his wife of 45 years, from their home in South East London. He has recently tried to sell the smugglers for £290,000, saying he wants to return to the UK to spend time with his grandchildren. But without any takers, he has told locals he plans to reopen at the start of the holiday season in May. A recent picture from the restaurant’s Facebook page shows him dressed in an apparent Halloween costume with white facepaint and green hair. He also runs an ‘unofficial’ taxi service with his friend’s van, which has infuriated the local cab firms, locals said. Ghouls¿ gallery: Davidson and friends pose in Halloween make up for picture posted on Facebook . Davidson, who has previously denied sabotaging the Lawrence investigation, was believed to be away last night and could not be reached for comment. One local said Davidson has told him that by the time he joined the investigation into Stephen’s murder – a few days after the teenager had been stabbed to death in the street by a gang – most of the evidence had already been corrupted. Scotland Yard dismissed renewed corruption claims against Davidson two years ago, although in 2006 former Met Assistant Commissioner John Yates told a BBC programme about the Lawrence case that he had no doubt that Davidson was corrupt. Mr Ellison’s bombshell report on Thursday said evidence suggests that Davidson acted corruptly during the murder inquiry. The National Crime Agency will investigate claims that Davidson had a corrupt relationship with Clifford Norris, during the early stages of the investigation. Norris’s son David was one of the original Lawrence suspects and was finally jailed for the murder in 2012. Davidson is expected to face questioning following Mark Ellison's (left) review into the Stephen Lawrence case . Davidson could be questioned on suspicion of misconduct in a public office or perverting the cause of justice – both of which carry heavy jail terms – by Britain’s new crime fighting force. The Smugglers, in the sleepy fishing village of Binibeca on Minorca’s south coast, is highly rated by users on the TripAdvisor website for its food – cooked by Mrs Davidson – friendliness and hospitality, although some locals claim it is cliquey, with non-regulars made to feel unwelcome. An owner of the neighbouring cafe claimed when he opened up four years ago Davidson ‘welcomed’ him by mocking him for having a cafe while he owned a restaurant. ‘He made me feel very small. It’s ironic, because he’s no good at serving tables at all and there are many complaints. He told me he only runs the restaurant to make a bit of spending money so he can go on lots of holidays during the winter.’ Last year the Davidsons put the restaurant up for sale. An advert read: ‘We have decided to retire home to the UK to spend time with our families and enjoy our grandchildren.’","John Davidson helped shield Stephen Lawrence's killers, it is alleged .

Tennis player Elena Baltacha has been diagnosed with cancer of the liver aged 30. The former British number one, who retired from the sport last year, said in a statement: 'I have recently been diagnosed with cancer of the liver. 'I'm currently undergoing treatment and fighting this illness with everything I have.' Tennis player Elena Baltacha announced today she has been diagnosed with liver cancer . The former British number one said she would be 'fighting this illness with everything I have' Britain's Federation Cup captain Judy Murray said it would be a 'tough time' for the player, pictured in 2013 . The Lawn Tennis Association statement continued: 'Elena and her husband Nino would like to thank everyone for their continued support.' Britain's Federation Cup captain Judy Murray said: 'Obviously this is a tough time for Bally, (her husband) Nino . and her family but she is a such a determined, upbeat person and . everyone around her is staying positive as well. 'I know she'll be really grateful for all the support that she's getting.' Ukraine-born, Baltacha won 11 singles titles, reached the third round of Wimbledon in 2002 . and the same stage of the Australian Open in 2005 and 2010. The 30-year-old from Perth, Scotland, made the announcement via Twitter. Messages of support for the tennis player began to flood in this afternoon, with former British number one and television presenter Andrew Castle posting on Twitter 'Passing on love and best wishes to Elena' Liver cancer is one of the deadliest forms of the disease. There are two broad categories - secondary and primary. Primary liver cancers start in the liver, while secondary develops elsewhere in the body and then spreads to the liver. It is sometimes called metastatic cancer and is the most common type of liver cancer in the Western World. Primary liver cancer is more common in men than in women, but it's not clear why. The condition is also more likely to affect people over the age of 60 and is rare below the age of 45. Although primary liver cancer is relatively rare in the UK and US (it is in the top 10 most diagnosed cancers), one type, hepatoma, is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. It is common in sub-saharan Africa and parts of Asia such as China. Often there are no symptoms in the early stages of liver cancer. This is because the liver is capable of functioning very well when only part of it is working. Typical symptoms include tiredness, weight loss, nausea/vomiting and itchy skin. Overall, the outlook is poor - the five-year survival rate of people with liver cancer is 16 per cent. For the 41 per cent of people who are diagnosed at an early stage, the five-year survival rate is 29 per cent. If the cancer has spread to a distant part of the body, the five-year survival rate is 3 per cent.Many people who develop primary liver cancer are already in poor health with cirrhosis.The best chance of a cure is with surgery when the cancer is small, has not spread from the liver, and the rest of your liver is relatively healthy. However, this situation only occurs in a minority of cases. Messages of support for the player were posted on social media this afternoon. Former . British number one and television presenter Andrew Castle ‏wrote: . 'Passing on love and best wishes to Elena Baltacha for a speedy . recovery. Shocked by this news.' Old rival Anne Keothavong, who along with Baltacha headed up the women's game for several years, ‏wrote on Twitter: 'She's one of the people I most admire for her courage and determination. You'll fight through this.' The official Twitter page for the Lawn Tennis association also wrote a message of support - writing: 'We’re all behind you @ElenaBaltacha. From everyone in British Tennis we send you our very best wishes.' Helen Grant, the government minister for sport, tourism and equalities, said: 'My thoughts are with Elena Baltacha, her family and friends.' Today, cancer charities have warned the player may need to have a liver transplant. Andrew Langford, chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said: 'The chances are she will have known for a while that she was at risk of liver cancer because of her PSC (primary sclerosing cholangitis). 'It's a genetic illness that infects your bile duct. You get a back flow of bile into your liver and that causes scarring in your liver. 'As the liver is more scarred it will be so damaged that you will have cirrhosis. 'Normally when we talk about liver cirrhosis people think about alcohol, but this is definitely not related to alcohol. 'I would imagine she will have a range of treatments. 'It will be a very difficult time for her and it may be that she eventually needs to have a liver transplant.' According to the British Liver Trust, liver disease is now the fifth biggest cause of death in England and Wales, after heart disease, cancer, stroke and respiratory disease. Martin Ledwick, head information nurse at Cancer Research UK, said: 'We're very sad to hear Elena has been diagnosed with liver cancer. 'If anyone has questions about the disease, or any other type of cancer, they can visit our website or call our team of cancer nurses free on 0808 800 40 40.' Born in Kiev, Ukraine, Baltacha comes from a sporting family. Her father is footballer Sergei Baltacha - who represented the Soviet Union and played in the United Kingdom for Ipswich Town, St. Johnstone and Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Her brother Sergei is also a footballer - who played for St Mirren and Millwall. Baltacha was born in Kiev, Ukraine, and moved to Ipswich when her father - footballer Sergei - was transferred to play for Ipswich in 1989 . Baltacha greets Queen Elizabeth II as she attends the Wimbledon in 2010. The player was diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis - a chronic liver condition - aged 19 . Her mother Olga represented the Soviet Union at Olympic level in both the heptathlon and pentathlon. She came to Britain with her family aged six when her father was transferred to Ipswich in 1989. At the age of 19 Baltacha was diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis - a chronic liver condition which affects the immune system. Despite her illness, she went on to win 11 singles titles - managing the condition throughout her professional career with medication and regular blood tests. She reached the third round of Wimbledon in 2002. She got to the same stage of the Australian Open twice - in 2005 and 2010. It was in 2010 she reached a career-high world ranking of 49.

The teenager was 10 miles away from home when tragedy took place on the A30 near Hartney Wintney, Hampshire. His family said today: 'Jack was a loving and caring boy who was adored by all his family. 'His energy and humour touched everyone that met him. 'He was a fantastic brother and the best son a parent could ask for. 'We miss you Jack, with all our hearts, and you will never be forgotten.' The lorry driver and a passenger, two men aged in their 30s, were shaken but uninjured in the collision on Monday afternoon. They were being treated as witnesses by police, who have appealed for information. The boy's father, Danny, is understood to be a serving soldier based in Germany. The youngster lived in Frimley with mother Natalie and three younger siblings - Hannah, Luke, aged two years and baby Lucy. Jack's friends at Tomlinscote School in Frimley have been devastated by his shock death. Head teacher Ian Hylan called the death 'deeply upsetting,' and said: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this most difficult of times. 'The school community has been told of this sad news and support is being provided to students and staff.' Online tributes have described the youngster as a 'lovely boy who will be truly missed by a lot of people,' and a 'happy, smiley boy.' Another friend wrote: 'RIP Jack Brown aka our batman.' Hampshire Police said it was not treating the teen's sudden death as suspicious. In an emotional statement today, Jack's family said: 'We miss you Jack, with all our hearts, and you will never be forgotten.' Hampshire police confirmed they are not treating his death as suspicious . An inquest was opened at Alton Magistrates' Court on Tuesday and was adjourned for a full hearing until May 21. A post-mortem examination has been conducted. Acting Sergeant Martin Mundy, of Hampshire Constabulary's Roads Policing Unit, said: 'We are continuing to appeal for other witnesses who may have seen the collision or the events immediately before the impact between the lorry and the pedestrian.'","Jack Brown, 15, died in hospital after he was hit by a Volvo truck .

Cherie Blair has launched a programme to help connect online mentors with women in developing countries trying to set up a businesses . Pope Francis was right. He recently said that the internet is a gift from God – and I couldn’t agree more. It is hard to imagine life without it. Available nearly 24-7 on our phones, in our homes, in public libraries, it has become a central part of everyday activities for most here in the UK – a modern necessity. When my barristers’ chambers first started using computers, I volunteered to teach myself to use the first word processor while I was on maternity leave. Two years later, I was the chair of the English Bar’s information technology committee, trying to convince my colleagues that access to a computer helped flexible working. I could do my legal work, not just in my chambers in London, but also when accompanying Tony to his constituency in Durham. Tony struggled initially, sticking to pen and paper while at No 10. I was jealous because he had a state-of-the-art computer on his desk which he never turned on. He did not even use a mobile phone when he had the wonderful No 10 switchboard to make his calls for him, which meant that when he stood down as Prime Minister, he was barely able to use his mobile. Sadly, he has now become a BlackBerry addict, which just goes to show that he still isn’t very up to date with the latest technology. Today, thanks to the internet, I can work anywhere in the world at times to suit my family demands. I can send emails at midnight, catch up with the day’s news, buy food or books or manage bank accounts – all online. But to many women in developing countries, the internet is much more than a convenience. It is a crucial lifeline which can mean the difference between success and failure. This is what Pope Francis was referring to – the ability to use the internet gives access to a whole new world of information and connections that can transform a person’s life. When I left Downing Street, I thought there must be a way to use the internet to connect women in a meaningful way. With the help of Google, my foundation developed a programme to connect online mentors with women who are trying to set up businesses in developing countries against the odds. Men don’t take them seriously.  They have a hard time getting loans. Sometimes they lack the proper business training to succeed. Meanwhile, they are expected to carry out their household duties and look after  the children. It can be a very lonely experience, so connecting to someone and being able to talk about these challenges can be a  complete game-changer. Take Shilpa, a business owner in India. She had an arranged marriage at a young age and a family who  were opposed to her attending university. She persisted and eventually completed a PhD programme in  psychology. She set up a personality assessment system for businesses but was derided by male colleagues and taken advantage of by suppliers. Early adopter: Former prime minister Tony Blair sends Cherie a bunch of flowers using the internet in 1999 . Shilpa had good business sense and the right education but it was a very difficult environment to work in and she felt isolated and defeated. Then we connected her to two mentors – Priya, an engineer and IT consultant with Accenture, one of our first corporate partners providing more than 40 mentors, and Maha, a treasury sales executive with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, where we have more than 100 employees involved in our mentoring programme. They met for only about two hours a month but those two hours changed Shilpa’s life. With Priya and Maha’s guidance, she was able to improve her website and develop a strategy to obtain clients. Perhaps most importantly, she gained a newfound self-confidence. The hostility and barriers she faces as a woman doing business in India remain but she now has a support system as she works to overcome them. 'Tony has now become a BlackBerry addict, which just goes to show that he still isn't very up to date with the latest technology' And it’s not just Shilpa who is  benefiting. Her son will grow up to see a woman who is successful in business and who has become a role model for other women. Shilpa is fortunate to have internet access. For others, the infrastructure isn’t always there. Access can be prohibitively expensive – far more than our monthly contracts in the UK. For developed countries, internet access is about one to two per cent  of monthly household income, but to access the internet in less developed countries, it costs closer to 30 per cent of the average monthly household income. It is no surprise then that less than a third of the population in developing countries are connected to the internet. There  are organisations addressing these issues, such as the Alliance For Affordable Internet, a coalition of more than 50 organisations from the public, private and civil society sectors. Shilpa is one of nearly 1,000 women in more than 50 countries we have mentored online. The impact is far reaching – research shows that women tend to reinvest their profits back into their families and communities so the more we  connect women worldwide, the better the world will be. As Pope Francis said: ‘It is not enough to be a passerby on the digital highways.’ Technology gives us the ability to give life-changing support with just a few hours of our time. I admit I have become a bit of a techie; always wanting the latest technology and lucky enough to be able to get it. But the internet is more than just gadgets. We can use it to stretch out a hand across the virtual world to help some really great women improve their lives and the lives of those around them.

Two friends who got gastric bands together after getting fed up of their size 20 plus figures ended up being nicknamed ‘little and large’ after the surgery had an opposite effect. Lisa O’Sullivan, 46, dropped to a size six after her gastric band was fitted as opposed to best friend Claire Green, 38, who remained a size 24. They decided to take action after over two decades of friendship they slowly ballooned in size until 5ft 4ins Lisa became a 16-stone size 20 and 5ft 9in Claire was a 20-stone size 24. Lisa O'Sullivan, left, lost a lot of weight after her gastric band was fitted while Claire Green, right, remained a size 24. They have both since had their bands adjusted and are now both at their ideal weight . Best friends Lisa O'Sullivan and Claire Green both decided to have weight loss surgery after they ballooned to size 20 plus . They both kept trying diets without success and with her 40th birthday close Lisa decided to take drastic action. Inspired . by her friend, Claire also booked in to have surgery and a month later . they were lying in side-by-side hospital beds in Belgium. But . that’s where their paths diverged. While Lisa then lost so much weight . she went down to a six-stone size four and was labelled anorexic, Claire . didn’t lose a single pound. Mrs . O’Sullivan said: ‘We’d always been fat together so it was awful when I . ended up so thin. We got called the Little and Large show.’ Only . now, six years later, have they finally achieved the figures they . always wanted. Procurement manager Lisa has gained weight and sales . manager Claire has finally shed some of hers. Mrs . O’Sullivan added: ‘There were times when we questioned what the hell we . had done. It’s been a bumpy ride but neither of us regret it because we . got here in the end. We supported each other through it and now we love . finally being slim together.’ The . friends met at work in 1991 and with matching appetites for fatty, . sugary foods they went shopping together for goodies to eat at their . desks. The pair, who have been friends for two decades, took action after their weight crept up, left. They are now enjoying their new slimmer sizes, right, and spend weekends going shopping for new clothes . Mrs O’Sullivan, from Mansfield, . Nottingham, said: ‘Every lunchtime we would hit the supermarket with a . trolley. It looked like we were shopping for a party but it was just our . lunch and afternoon snacks. ‘We . would eat huge meals and desserts. For lunch we would have a huge . filled baguette, a bag of crisps and some chocolate or biscuits.’ Every . afternoon they snacked on treats including chocolate Minstrels, . flapjacks, cookies, Dairy Milk bars and Babybel cheeses. But they hated . being fat, felt guilty, and vowed to change their unhealthy ways. Ms . Green, from Birmingham, said: ‘Over the years we tried every diet going . together. We’d lose a bit of weight then our love of food would take . over and we’d start scoffing treats again.’ When Lisa was 39 they were living and working in different areas, but still remained best friends. She . recalls: ‘Food was still our favourite topic. But I didn’t want to be . fat at 40 so told Claire my surgery plan and wasn’t surprised when she . followed suit.’ Mrs O'Sullivan, from Mansfield, Nottingham, pictured before her weight loss, decided to have the gastric band fitted before her 40th birthday . Lisa O'Sullivan, pictured after her weight loss, is much happier now she is a size 10-12 . Lisa, left, is now a healthy size 10-12 while Claire, right, has dropped seven stone to a size 14 . With the operation likely to cost them £10,000 each in the UK, they went abroad where the price was £4,000. The night before the surgery in Brussels they pigged out at a Chinese restaurant. Ms Green said: ‘It felt like the last supper because we both knew we would never be able to do it again.’ The next morning Lisa was first into theatre for the two-hour operation and the friends spent two days recovering before flying home. In the first two weeks Lisa lost half a stone eating tiny amounts of pureed food. But Claire didn’t lose anything. She said: ‘I wasn’t too worried at that point. Everyone is different so I hoped I would catch up.’ Over the following year Lisa lost three stone but Claire was still struggling. Ms Green said: ‘I didn’t feel envious. Lisa was proof that it could work and I just needed to get mine right. ‘She could barely eat half of a plate of food but I could still polish off the lot.’ Lisa, pictured, who is now a healthy size 10-12, is happy with her figure after dropping six stone . To celebrate their new figures, the best friends booked a glamourous photo shoot to show off their new bodies . By the time Lisa had dropped to a size 12 Claire had gone back to Belgium for new surgery to adjust her band. Afterwards her weight finally started to fall off. But Lisa was still losing pound after pound even though she’d passed her target. After treating herself to a whole new size 12 wardrobe, in the year that followed it started to swamp her frame and soon she had to wear a tiny size six. She said: ‘I was trying to eat more but would just bring it back up and kept losing more weight. I bought a size eight outfit before I went on holiday, and when I returned two weeks later it drowned me. I had lost another stone in that fortnight. ‘It got to the point where I could only eat tiny amounts of food and even that would leave me in pain and being sick. I reached a size four and looked anorexic. Lisa, left, dropped to a size six after her gastric band was fitted too tight. She has since gone back to a healthy size 10-12. Claire, right, lost seven stone after her band was also adjusted . ‘I hated it – I looked old and haggard. People kept asking me if I was ill. I knew they meant with an eating disorder. ‘My husband Clive had been so supportive all the way. When I told him I wanted the surgery he said it was my decision and he would back me. But when I lost so much weight he was really worried.’ Eventually Lisa’s boss insisted she go to hospital for a check-up and it was later confirmed that her band had slipped, meaning she wasn’t absorbing any nutrients and had become seriously malnourished. ‘It was made even more difficult because my surgeon was in Belgium so I couldn’t keep nipping back to see him,’ she said. ‘When I was admitted to hospital here the doctors had to speak to my surgeon in Brussels so they could work together to solve the problem.’ She had a new operation to correct the problem and was told to keep eating until her weight reached a healthy range. She said: ‘It was fun being able to eat what I wanted again. I was so relieved when my bottom and bust started to fill out again.’ Eventually she reached 10 stone and a size 10-12. She said: ‘My wardrobe was stuffed with everything from size 20 to size four. It was ridiculous.’ While Lisa was regaining weight Claire, who is single, had dropped to 13 stone 12lbs and a size 14 and was finally happy with her figure too. She said: ‘We went from being two fatties to Little and Large and now we both feel fabulous. It wasn’t exactly the quick answer we hoped, but we couldn’t be happier now.’ Mrs O’Sullivan added: ‘Instead of bonding over our love of food, now we bond over our love of clothes and shopping. ‘Every time we see each other we hit the shops. Unless you have been overweight you don’t understand what it feels like now to be thin. It has boosted our confidence no end. ‘It is amazing just to be able to go out and buy what you want and wear what you want for the first time ever. We have both gone from wearing black shapeless things and leggings to buying nice colourful dresses, even bikinis for holidays. ‘I love shoes and have more than 300 pairs but even my shoe size has dropped from a 7.5 to a 6. I need to have a good clear-out to make room for some more.’ To celebrate their slimming success, the pair booked a glamorous photoshoot - something they would never have dreamed of before their surgery. Ms O’Sullivan said: ‘I booked it as a surprise for Claire. It was a real treat and we giggled all the way there and back pretending to be famous. ‘Having the surgery really has changed our lives for the better in the end.’","Lisa O'Sullivan dropped to a size six after the £4,000 weight loss surgery .

Concerns: The damning report shows that President Francois Hollande is facing increasing problems as he looks to streamline the public sector . French public sector workers take an average of nearly a month off beyond annual leave, a damning report has revealed. The publication highlighted the increasing problems facing President Francois Hollande as he seeks to reduce the country's huge public deficit. State workers make up one fifth of France's total employed ranks and their salaries account for a quarter of public expenditure. A report by civil society think tank iFRAP found that local public workers in cities of over 100,000 residents, excluding Paris, missed nearly a month of work on average per year on top of holidays - more than twice the rate in the private sector. The study calculated public servants in 25 cities missed work an average of 26 days per year, or 12 percent of total work days. That figure included temporary or long-term illness, work accidents, maternity and paternity leave and unexplained absences. The highest figures were in the southern city of Montpellier, with an average 39 days of absence, followed by Grenoble and Strasbourg in the east, at 35 and 32 days each. By contrast, the average equivalent absentee rate at five major companies - Air Liquide, BNP Paribas, Renault, Bouygues and ADP - was just 4 percent. One of the reasons French employers suggested the figures were so high was that doctors were too ready to issue sick notes. French absenteeism rates are higher than the European average, according to data from the International Labour Organization. Some 3.7 million public and private sector employees in France worked 'no hours' in 2012 during one week studied by the ILO versus 4.5 million in Germany, but above the 3.1 million UK employees, 1.9 million in Italy, and 557,000 in Switzerland. The CGT public servants' union criticised iFRAP's data, claiming it was misleading and did not take into account job functions, the age of workers and varying working environments. 'It's very hard to extract real figures that are representative,' said the CGT's Philippe Vorkaufer. Pledge: Hollande has promised to find over 50 billion euros in public spending cuts between 2015-2017 to cut taxes . Hollande has promised to find over 50 billion euros in public spending cuts between 2015-2017 to reduce taxes. If the target is reached it honour a deficit-cutting pledge by the euro zone's second-largest economy to its EU partners. The EU Commission on Wednesday told France it would miss its targets unless it took action. Details on where the savings will come from will only be disclosed following local French elections late this month. The . ruling Socialist majority is hoping to avoid a backlash from record . high unemployment and a stagnant economy that have sent Hollande's . approval ratings plummeting. Cutting public servants would represent a politically risky move certain to mobilize powerful unions to the streets. It would also further exacerbate the welfare tab by pushing more people into unemployment. 'Any policy of lowering public spending must depend on the two principle spending items: social charges and personnel expenses,' wrote a February study from the liberal Institut Montaigne think tank. Critics say Hollande's budgetary reform is confused, pointing to his reversal of a key measure begun by predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy designed to curb absenteeism by withholding pay for the first sick day taken.

A man who bought a talking toy remote control for his toddler grandson was outraged when it blurted out 'f***s' instead of the number six. Joe McManus, 61, paid Â£4.50 for the Little Tikes First Remote Control at an Asda branch in Birkby, West Yorkshire, for 18-month-old Vinnie Lydall who he said was 'mad about gadgets'. He returned it to store staff - who said they agreed it sounded rude and said they would clear all other models from the shelves. Foul-mouthed: Joe McManus, 61, was shocked when he realised the toy he bought at Asda for his 18-month-old grandson Vinnie Lydall was blurting out 'f***s' in a robotic voice instead of the number six . Hanging on the telephone: Mr McManus claimed his complaints to the firm were not taken seriously enough . But although the supermarket said Mr McManus was the only customer to complain, he fears the foul-mouthed toy could be a bad influence on other children. The grandfather-of-10 said: 'Vinnie was just sat playing with it one day pressing the buttons when we heard it. When you press the six button it says the F-word. Little Tikes: The firm said 20,000 of the toys have been sold and this was the first complaint . 'Call me old-fashioned but I believe that a child's first words should be mum or dad, or maybe please and thank you, but not four-letter swear words.' He added: 'Vinnie's mad about gadgets and will press the buttons of anything he can get his hands on. He likes to mess around with our iPad and have the Wii on, even if he's not playing on it. 'A few times he's picked up the phone and ended up calling somebody, so we thought we'd buy him his own phone and that would keep him happy.' The retired plant worker, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, bought the plastic pink toy which he described as a phone on January 23. When he noticed the defect he returned it to Asda and complained to toy firm Little Tikes. He said: 'They agreed with me it sounded rude and gave me my money back and assured me they would make sure no more were on the shelf. 'But when I went back a couple of weeks later they had restocked the shelves with more of the phones. 'I took one to the customer service lady who said they didn't have the authority to take items off the shelves. 'She said she'd look into it but didn't really seem interested. I don't have a problem with Asda, but I think there's been a lack of communication in customer services. 'This has been going on for weeks now... I'm surprised no-one else has complained. Bad education: Mr McManus hoped the toy would teach Vinnie to count, but it taught him otherwise . Profane: Vinnie's grandmother said it was a good thing their other nine grandchildren and not picked it up . '[Little Tikes] said it wasn't their problem and advised that I got in touch with the distributors, so I sent them an email and recieved no reply.' His wife Jackie, 60, added: 'Luckily, Vinnie is too young to pick up the language, but I would be really annoyed if one of my older grandchildren started playing with it.'

Sacrifices: Cecil Bray, 82, in the wheelchair, who was today handed back his inheritance after his aunt decided to give it all to her window cleaner . A elderly man who lost out on £300,000 after his 'curmudgeonly' aunt left her entire fortune to a window cleaner has been handed back his inheritance by a judge. Cecil Bray was at Julie Spalding's 'beck and call' after he gave up work to look after her in 1996, the High Court Heard. He ran errands and organised her affairs as the increasingly capricious pensioner 'called the shots' around her home until she finally shut him out and changed her will. Now, after a judge reversed Mrs Spalding's final will and testament, the window cleaner to whom she left her worldly possessions must pay it all back all back. Mr Bray, now 82, had taken a retirement job as a driver, said Judge Murray Rosen QC, but he resigned to 'dedicate more time' to looking after her his aunt which became 'almost a full-time job'. 'In return she told him she would ‘compensate’ him by leaving him her bungalow in her will,' the judge explained. 'From that point onwards Mr Bray was effectively at her beck and call.' Mrs Spalding drew up a will in 2003 which left the bulk of her cash and her home in Great North Way, Hendon, to her nephew - with the estate in total valued at more than £300,000. But following a series of falls in 2005 she underwent a major personality change, after which Mr Bray was 'excommunicated from her life'. He was 'ordered out of her house', he told the court, soon after meeting her window cleaner, Albert Pearce, at her home in July of that year. He had no memory of a previous meeting, said the judge, who added that 'any previous encounter with Mr Pearce would have been as his aunt’s window cleaner'. From that point onward, Mr Pearce, himself now 80, became an increasingly important figure in Mrs Spalding’s life. Mr Bray, meanwhile, was forced to recede into the background by his own failing health. Although for many years he had thought of himself as her 'favourite nephew', his close family 'urged him to avoid contact with her due to the stress involved'. When she died in 2008, aged 98, she left Mr Pearce everything. Mrs Spalding was described in court as a 'fiercely independent and indeed difficult woman', but with a great love of animals and enduring Jewish faith. 'Mr Bray reckoned that, at any one time, she had only been on speaking terms with 10 to 15 percent of her family,' said the judge. The case reached court as Mr Bray, who came out of hospital in a wheelchair to testify, challenged the validity of his aunt’s last three wills. His barrister, Constance McDonnell, claimed Mrs Spalding lacked the required 'testamentary capacity' to execute the series of disputed wills, the last of which she signed the year before she died. It was also Mr Bray’s case that Mr Pearce, Mrs Spalding's sole beneficiary, 'procured the wills by undue influence'- a claim which the judge ultimately rejected. Out of luck: Window cleaner Albert Pearce, who was the sole beneficiary of Julie Spalding's final will, must now pay Mr Bray back the entire £300,000 legacy after a judge ruled she should have kept her earlier promises . Mr Pearce insisted he had never been interested in Mrs Spalding’s money and that he had always done his best to care for her. There was no evidence of 'coercion' on the window cleaner’s part, said the judge, who also rejected claims that Mr Pearce was 'cavalier' in his care of Mrs Spalding in the last months of her life. However, he ruled that Mrs Spalding had 'expressly agreed' that she would leave her house to Mr Bray when she died and, given all her nephew had done for her, it was right to hold her to her promise. Stripping Mr Pearce of his inheritance, Judge Rosen ruled Mrs Spalding lacked the mental capacity to make all of her final three wills and found in favour of the 2003 document, which left Mr Bray all but £14,000 of her estate. 'Mr Pearce will now have to repay all he has received from Mrs Spalding’s estate,' the judge concluded.","Cecil Bray gave up his job to look after his elderly aunt Julie Spalding .

'Illustrious horsewoman' Patricia 'Paddy' Muir (pictured riding a different horse) facing £150k bill for selling a mount 'not fit for purpose in 2007 . A champion showjumper sold one of her riding pupils an elderly horse that was ‘ready for the knacker’s yard’, a court heard. John Palmer claims the ‘defective’ horse had to be put down just months after he bought it from three-day eventer Patricia ‘Paddy’ Muir. Miss Muir now faces a huge £150,000 bill for legal costs after senior judges upheld Mr Palmer’s second appeal, after he lost the original case. Mr Palmer, a financial adviser, of Corbridge, County Durham, launched court action against ‘illustrious horsewoman’ Miss Muir, a previous winner of the Blenheim Palace horse trials, claiming she sold him a mount which was ‘unfit for purpose’, in 2007. However, Miss Muir, who runs a riding stable at Stokesley, North Yorkshire, insisted she had never owned the horse – a 14-year-old hunter named Toby – and that she merely acted as an agent for Mr Palmer in the purchase, at his request. She denied any responsibility for Toby’s state of health or that he ‘lacked merchantable quality at the time of sale or was unfit for purpose’. Mr Palmer lost the argument after two court hearings, but senior judges in London have now upheld his appeal, opening a new chapter in the enormously costly legal saga. Appeal Court judge, Sir Stanley Burnton, decried the legal costs of the case – estimated at £150,000. ‘This is in many ways a sad case. The claim is for less than £9,000,’ he observed. ‘We are now hearing a second appeal in this case - in which the costs by now must inevitably be many times the value of the claim.’ Mark Anderson QC, for Mr Palmer, said his client had asked Miss Muir to ‘keep an eye out’ for a suitable mount for him to use as a novice in eventing and initially agreed to pay £5,000 for Toby in the belief that he was an 11-year-old. He added that Mr Palmer, 55, later dropped the price to £2,750 after seeing the horse’s papers and learning he was 14. After buying and riding the horse, Mr Palmer found it had an ‘abnormal hopping gait’, which caused him to occasionally lose balance while riding. Mr Anderson said: ‘The horse went lame shortly after Mr Palmer bought it and was put out to grass thereafter.’ After a vet declared Toby unsuitable to ride, he was put down in June 2008 for medical reasons. Mr Anderson told the court that a post-mortem examination of the animal revealed that one of its front feet was bigger than the other. The barrister told the judges: ‘Mr Palmer bought a horse which turned out to be of unsatisfactory quality and unfit for its purpose. ‘He says he bought it from Miss Muir in the course of her business as a horse trainer and occasional dealer and that the sale was therefore subject to the statutory implied terms as to quality and fitness.’ John Palmer (pictured with his wife left) claims the horse had to be put down . just months after he bought it from the three-day eventer (right) Patrick Limb QC, for Miss Muir, told the court that the showjumper did not own the horse and that Mr Palmer should have known that. ‘Though an illustrious horsewoman, with considerable equine knowledge, Miss Muir was merely seeking to help him find a horse in response to requests that she source one for him,’ the barrister said. At the original hearing, a judge found in favour of Miss Muir, who regularly competes at Badminton. Mr Palmer appealed but this was dismissed by a county court judge. Sir Stanley, sitting with Sir Terence Etherton and Lord Justice Kitchin, said the ‘vital points’ in deciding the case were ‘the nature of the agreement and whether the horse was in fact defective’. Allowing Mr Palmer’s appeal and sending the case back to be re-heard, Sir Stanley concluded: ‘There was no sensible finding of fact as to the condition of Toby at the point of sale. ‘I see no alternative but for the case to be remitted to the County Court for re-hearing by a different judge.’ Outside court, Mr Palmer said: ‘I  would never have bought it if I had known what it was – it was ready for the knacker’s yard.’","Patricia 'Paddy' Muir sold one of her riding pupils, John Palmer, an elderly horse 'ready for knacker's yard', a court heard .

Instead of standing near water level, visitors to the i360 tower will now need to look 574ft down to see the ocean. The pier, which was built in 1866 was declared beyond repair in 2004. When construction work is finished in the summer of 2016, a futuristic tower will take its place. Brighton's answer to the Eiffel Tower will be 574ft (175m) high. It will be built on the beach running parallel to the King's Road in Brighton. The building will replace the former West Pier created in 1866 . Planning permission was granted in 2006. Eight years on, following a deal between the Conservative and Green party, Brighton Council has agreed to increase its loan for the project from £14.8 million to £36 million . Despite the fact that the i360 was granted planning permission in 2006, a private backer withdrew funding worth £15 million last year and construction plans ground to a halt . The London-based architects behind the tower, Marks Barfield, also designed the London Eye. On top of council funding, Marks Barfield will inject £6 million into its construction . The tower will have a capacity for 200 visitors at one time. The visiting dock will look out onto the city from almost 600ft above ground level .

The total bill for the tower has now soared to £46.2 million. Green Councillor and Council Leader Jason Kitcat has argued that the loan will be financially beneficial for the city. He said that the £21 million made in interest payments and fees could be used to repair seafront arches, structures, sea defences and walls.  The structures are currently in need of repair work worth £70 million. Mr Kitcat said: 'This is a crucial project for revitalising our tourism industry and our seafront for years into the future. It will very clearly signal that our city is open for business - both to visitors and investors. 'This deal will bring in over £1m a . year additional income to the council whilst also regeneration the local . area and supporting our tourism economy. 'It . will provide an extraordinary and spectacular new centrepiece to our . seafront.

He . told the Brighton paper: 'Next week they will be committing two . generations of council taxpayers to nearly forty million pounds of debt . on a project that no private investor will support.' The tower is expected to welcome 750,000 visitors each year. At one time, the attraction can hold 200 visitors. If work begins on time, the i360 is expected to open in June 2016. The West Pier was previously home to a theatre and a concert hall. It attracted two million visitors each year . Fallen glory: Brighton's West Pier was the crown jewel of the city in the 1920s. But over 100 years after it was first built, the pier has been left to fall apart and is now derelict. A 30 year battle was launched to restore the piece of architecture. But in 2004 the campaign ended after English Heritage declared it beyond repair . West Pier was once one of Brighton's most stunning settings. The pier has since fallen into disrepair and been ravaged by two fires. Its spot will soon be taken by the i360 tower . Mods and rockers: Brighton was a fashion capital for mods and rockers in the 1960s. Mods would wear suits and ride scooters while rockers generally wore leather. Pictured here is a group of mods on the Brighton seafront . The West Pier was built in 1866 by naval architect Eugenius Birch. The pier was home to a theatre and a concert hall. It has been closed since 1975. Since then the pier has been ravaged by two fires and several storms - little of the original pier still stands. It is one of only two Grade I listed piers in the UK, the other being Clevedon Pier. In its heydey, the West Pier attracted two million visitors a year. From June 2016 the i360, which will cost more than £46 million will stand in the same spot. The project's website claims that the i360 will follow the same spirit as the West Pier by offering visitors to 'walk on air' in the same way as they were previously 'walking on water'. The i360 will also welcome visitors with Victorian tollbooth's to celebrate the pier's history and parts of the same cast iron structure will also be used for the tower's visitor centre. Although the pier will no longer stand, a proportion of revenue from the i360 will go towards promoting the pier's heritage.","The 574ft tower will be erected in the spot previously held by Brighton's historical West Pier .

Although the temperatures nationwide will be a far cry from the March weather record - a reading of 25.6C in Cambridgeshire from 1968 - they are still several degrees in excess of the average. The happy predictions come as Tesco announces that its first English strawberries will be on sale tomorrow thanks to an early harvest because of the unseasonal warmth. The supermarket said that fruit from Chichester, West Sussex, will be sold from tomorrow - a week earlier than usual. Strawberry buyer Simon Mandelbaum said: 'We are a nation of strawberry-lovers who cannot get our hands on the English crop quick enough and this year will be no exception - we are expecting a mad rush. 'Good levels of sunshine and unseasonably warm weather so far in March have been key for our growers, giving them an early crop.'

Jin Cheng, owner of the Laughing Buddha in Maidstone, Kent, admits losing his cool when customers complained about the food and slow service at his Chinese restaurant . A restaurant owner lost more than £1,000 when he rowed with a big party of unhappy customers - causing 43 people to walk out without paying. Jin Cheng admits to losing his cool when the group complained about the food and slow service at his Chinese eaterie. One customer, who was so irate at the delays at the Laughing Buddha, stormed into the kitchen and started shouting at the chef. Mr Cheng told the group they should leave if they didn’t want to pay - and all 36 got up and walked out after finishing their food and drinks. They were joined by another seven from a different group who took advantage of the Saturday night chaos at the restaurant in Maidstone, Kent. It has left Mr Cheng with an unpaid bill amounting to £1,128.72, yet he has been told police can't help as it is ‘a civil matter’. He admitted yesterday: 'If I’m honest, I did have a bit of a breakdown on the night. 'I was very angry and told customers if they didn’t want to pay, they should leave. 'On top of this, a table of seven snuck out while I was talking to the large table. 'The thing is, the group of 36 people who took the offer and left had arrived late. If there was a delay, that’s why. 'Even if you don’t like the food, you can at the very least pay for the drinks.' He added: 'I’m very angry and worried about how this is going to affect my business. 'My takings have been down since and one member of staff resigned after what happened. 'I spent three years building my reputation on Tripadvisor - now all you can see is these complaints.' Mr Cheng said the large party ate a range of starters on the night in question, including prawn toast, satay chicken, spring rolls, spare ribs, smoked shredded chicken and crispy seaweed. He said they also finished a second course of crispy duck but walked out before their main course was served. The Laughing Buddha was awarded a certificate of excellence from Tripadvisor last year and has 111 five-star reviews out of 169 posts.

Mr Cheng lost more than £1,000 after 43 customers walked out without paying. He said: 'My takings have been down since and one member of staff resigned after what happened' But one customer who didn’t walk out posted a review describing his experience on the night as ‘absolutely shocking’. They wrote: 'Had the worst dining experience of my life. 'The service was absolutely awful....by 10pm, having been in the restaurant for two hours, we hadn’t even ordered our main courses. 'Whilst we were there, 48 people got up and walked out of the restaurant due to the horrific service - they had asked to see the manager, but the manager made no appearance, so they got fed up of waiting. Mr Cheng said the incident has affected trade at the Laughing Buddha - a Chinese restaurant and takeaway . 'They had the cheek to add a service charge to the bill which we took up with the owner of the restaurant - after he had dealt with a similar issue with another table. 'Following our horrific ordeal, the owner ‘graciously’ waived the 10% service charge and ‘generously’ gave us a whole £3 off our bill rounding it down to £50 and telling us that he had already lost £800 that night as if we were supposed to feel sorry for him. 'He then stood up and turned around to the rest of the restaurant and shouted ""does anyone else want to have a go, I’m standing right here?"". 'The owner was rude and obnoxious and had literally zero understanding of how disgraceful the evening had been for EVERY diner in his restaurant - treating every customer as if they were being unreasonable in their expectations. Several pictures of dishes from the Laughing Buddha have been posted on Tripadvisor including one of the Crispy Seaweed Duck, left, and the rice-based Nasi Lemak, right . 'It is impossible to please everyone in this world, and of course there will always be the odd complaint here and there, but when an ENTIRE restaurant of people complains, and 48 walk out, you really do need to question what you are doing wrong - and not treat your customers as if they are being unjustified in their complaint. 'The food was nice though when we eventually got it - I’ll give them that.' Mr Cheng said he has been in contact with the big group but says they are refusing to pay the outstanding £1,128.72 bill. He is now considering swallowing the loss because he fears taking them to court will cost him more than the loss of earnings. Kent Police said: 'He has been advised that this is a civil matter.'

Trott, 32, left England’s Ashes tour after the first Test in Brisbane with what was described as a stress-related condition following a traumatic ordeal at the hands of Mitchell Johnson. But the No 3 is ready to make a comeback and will be targeting a return to the Test team. Hard at work: Jonthan Trott in the gym ahead of his comeback for Warwickshire .

Much needed rest: Jonathan Trott is on course for his April comeback with Warwickshire . Trouble: The batsman, 32, hasn't featured since leaving England's Ashes tour due to a stress-related illness . Trott tweeted: 'Thrilled to confirm I will return for @CricketingBears vs Gloucs on 1st April. Thanks to everyone for such amazing support #youbears'. And in a statement released by Warwickshire he added: 'I’ve been overwhelmed with the kind messages of support from players, coaches and fans over the last few months, and I’m really looking forward to joining up with Warwickshire ahead of the new season. 'We’ve got a strong squad that’s capable of challenging for trophies in all competitions, and I’m determined to play a big role and hopefully contribute to more success for the Bears in 2014 and beyond.' The county's coach Dougie Brown said: 'Everyone at Edgbaston will be thrilled to see Jonathan return to training after the Club’s pre-season tour of Barbados, and take to the field at Edgbaston in the 2014 season. 'Having met recently, he looks in great shape and is certainly hungry to score plenty of runs for Warwickshire. He’s been a crucial member of the England set up for nearly five years and I am certain he will be back as England's No 3 in the near future.' Disappointing: Alastair Cook's side were embarrassed in Australia, but Trott is focused on a return . No 3 problem: Ian Bell (left) and Joe Root (right) struggled in Trott's position Down Under . When it was . revealed that Trott had long-standing mental health issues during the tour Down Under, it seemed . his career at the highest level was over. But Warwickshire chief executive Dennis Amiss, who will serve . as Trott’s benefit chairman this summer, said: ‘He’s still very . hungry. He wants to continue succeeding for Warwickshire and England.’ If . his comeback game goes to plan, Trott, who has been given permission to miss . his county’s pre-season tour of Barbados, will play against Oxford . University on April 7 and then the Championship opener at Edgbaston . against Sussex the following week. ‘He’s . doing very well,’ said former England batsman Amiss. ‘He’s had a great . rest, which was very important, and he is raring to go again. ‘Cricket . is his passion and I believe he has the qualities to come back, score a . mass of runs for Warwickshire and get himself back in the England . side.’ Out of practice? Trott has hardly featured for Warwickshire since earning his England contract . While it is . undoubtedly good news that Trott is on the mend, England will have to be . certain that the problem will not recur if he again faces the stresses . of top level cricket. They . were aware of Trott’s earlier problems - and left him out of a one-day . international against Australia at the Ageas Bowl last summer because of . his condition - and handled his departure Down Under with great . sensitivity. Yet if he makes . an immediate return to the international fold it may look as though it . is permissible to quit a difficult, high-profile tour and return as soon . as the going gets better, in this case when England face Scotland and . then Sri Lanka early this summer before their Test series against India. Amiss, . who is undoubtedly speaking for Trott now, has no doubts. ‘I think the . problem was essentially burn-out,’ he said. ‘The ECB have helped him . since he has been back home. Everyone has given him a lot of help. Rest . is the most important thing.’ Familiar pose: Trott will hope to get back to acknowledging centuries for England . Trott . is understood to have held talks with Paul Downton, the busy new . England managing director, to try to convince him that he will be fit . for England this summer. And . a team who are starting from scratch after the worst Ashes tour in . history will not lightly turn their back on a batsman with a Test . average of almost 47 and a one-day average of 51.

This incredible X-Ray shows how a farmer was millimetres from death when an 18-inch metal prong speared his torso but miraculously missed all his vital organs after snagging on his key fob. Graham Heatley, 52, was speared through the right buttock by the bailing fork which came out the lower left side of his stomach after he forgot to apply the handbrake on his 1.5 tonne tractor and it rolled back downhill towards him. Emergency services rushed to Mr Heatley's 160 acre farm in Lyneal, Shropshire, after neighbours heard his cries for help. An X-Ray shows the spike pierced through Graham Heatley's body but was stopped from going further by his key chain . The accident happened after Mr Heatley forgot to apply the handbrake on his 1.5 tonne tractor (pictured) and it rolled back downhill towards him . Mr Heatley was flown to hospital by air ambulance in a serious condition with the spike still sticking out of his body. He then underwent a four-hour operation at University Hospital of North Staffordshire where doctors found the prong had missed his vital organs by just 1.5cm. Incredibly, he was out of hospital within six days of the fork being removed. Mr Heatley, who runs the 160 acre farm with his mum Mary, 78, said he knew he was in trouble when he felt a 'sharp twinge' in his backside. He went on: 'I had picked up some up some hay and had placed it on the floor to cut the wrap and I don’t think I applied the hand-brake properly on the tractor because I felt this fork going into me. 'As I was bending over I felt this sharp twinge and I knew that’s when I was in trouble. 'I turned to work out what was happening I saw it was rolling towards me and the tine went into my right buttock. 'It ended up going through and poked out of my abdomen on the left.

Surgeon Neil Yeomans, who performed the four-hour operation, said it was one of the most unusual injuries he has ever had to deal with. He said: 'We put him through the scanner to see what exactly we were dealing with. 'We then had to put him on the operating table in the theatre at 45 degrees because of how the spike was sticking through him. 'To keep him at that angle we had to use sandbags to prop him up and support him, which is highly unusual. 'We then had to ease his clothes off around the spike as he was fully clothed. 'I then had to operate on him on his side, which can be quite difficult when you are not used to doing it. 'In total three of us were doing the surgery and we just had to pull the spike in a controlled direction. 'The spike had entered the pelvis and was only 1.5cm from his urethra and it was only an inch from the vessel in front of the rectum and behind the bladder. So it missed the rectal tube. 'If the spike hadn’t missed any of those then it would have been life threatening and he could have been left having to use a colostomy bag.

The Pyrenees form an effective land barrier in the northeast from the . rest of Europe, and in the south at Gibraltar the peninsula is separated . from North Africa by a narrow strait. This astronaut-image reveals how close the Iberian Peninsula is to Morocco. A thin line of blackness – the Strait of Gibraltar – separates the two. Another thin line stands out in this picture.

Four women who underwent womb transplants have had embryos implanted into them to try and get them pregnant. Since 2012, nine women have received wombs donated by relatives in an experimental procedure. The treatment is designed to test whether it is possible to transfer a uterus into a woman so she can give birth to her own child. Hope: Four Swedish women who received transplanted wombs have had embryos transferred into them in an attempt to get them pregnant . The women had IVF before the transplant, using their own eggs to make embryos. 'We have already begun transferring . embryos into four of the women and plan to make attempts with the others . when they are ready,' said Dr Mats Brannstrom, a professor of . obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Gothenburg, who is leading . the research. Derya Sert (pictured), from Turkey, had a transplant in August 2011. She subsequently conceived but then miscarried after eight weeks of pregnancy . He would not say whether any of the women are pregnant. Of the nine who got transplanted wombs, two had to have them removed because of complications. One previous high profile case was that of Derya Sert, from Turkey. She has a womb transplant in August 2011 and subsequently conceived, but then miscarried after eight weeks of pregnancy. dR Brannstrom predicted that three or four of the seven women might successfully give birth. 'One or two more will perhaps get pregnant and miscarry and one or two won't be able to get pregnant,' he said. Dr Brannstrom said any woman who does get pregnant will be on a low dose of drugs to keep from rejecting the transplanted womb and will be monitored as a high-risk pregnancy. He added that some women had received their new . wombs from their mothers and there was a higher rate of complications . with older uteruses. Eight of the nine women who were given transplants suffer from MRKH syndrome, a congenital disorder which prevents the womb from developing, but means she still has intact ovaries which produce eggs. This means a woman's egg could be fertilised outside of her body and the embryo then placed in her womb. The ninth woman had her womb removed after suffering cervical cancer. The development of womb transplants has given hope to thousands of childless women across Europe and at least 15,000 in the UK. The women had IVF before the transplant, using their own eggs to make embryos . The method has been controversial though . because it involves taking wombs from living donors. The Swedish team . favours it because the organs are generally in better condition and a . better immunological match. But other surgeons in the same field do not believe it is right to put a living donor through such a major operation when it is not life-saving. About one girl in 4,500 is born with MRKH, where she doesn't have a womb. Dr Brannstrom said the transplanted wombs would be removed after a maximum of two pregnancies. 'Based on our previous work and animal studies, we are optimistic,' he said. 'But we cannot guarantee anything.'","Since 2012, nine women have received wombs donated by relatives .

A 45-year-old lawyer who plunged to his death from a Manhattan building on Friday was suffering from bi-polar, was still reeling from the deaths of his parents and had recently separated from his wife, friends say. Leonard Morton, who represented the likes of Madison Square Garden and The Lincoln Center, jumped from a 12th-floor window and landed face down on scaffolding above the sidewalk on Broadway near Barclay Street at about 7.20am. He died at the scene near City Hall, with officers quickly covering his body with a sheet as workers in neighboring buildings looked on as they arrived for work.

A Pittsburgh lawyer's online ad showing smiling robbers, drug dealers and prostitutes flashing thumbs up and thanking him for getting them off the hook has garnered tens of thousands of views and drawn fire from a local bar association. One fictional criminal pauses while climbing out a window, carrying a laptop to say 'Thanks Dan,' to the camera, while a pair of men carrying handguns offer a similar message before pulling ski masks over their faces in the three-minute, 27-second ad posted on YouTube by criminal defense attorney Daniel Muessig.

The spot has been viewed more than 80,000 times since Muessig posted it on Thursday, and the attorney believes the tongue-in-cheek approach will extend his client base. 'I wanted to connect with my potential clients in a way that people from my generation could understand,' Muessig told Reuters on Friday.

Tom Loftus, spokesman for the Allegheny County Bar Association, said he found the ad 'insulting to Pittsburgh lawyers and lawyers across the country, who take great pride in their profession'.

He said he worried that the video could be misinterpreted. 'There could be kids watching it, or people who don't even understand what tongue-in-cheek means, and what they'll see is: if you commit a crime this attorney will get you off without any explanation,' Loftus said. Muessig defended the spot but said he would take it down if law enforcement or a legal professional organization asked him to.

"By . Will Payne In Lincoln Park, New Jersey . PUBLISHED: . 12:39 EST, 7 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 13:42 EST, 7 March 2014 . The ‘spoiled’ cheerleader fighting a bitter law suit against her parents previously threatened to sue a teacher for kicking her out of the Homecoming dance because he thought she was drunk. Senior tutor William Schilling spotted Rachel Canning out in the parking lot with a group of boys – including her boyfriend Lucas Kitzmiller – and thought they were acting suspiciously. Earlier in the evening Rachel, now 18, had apparently been hard loudly boasting that she had Everclear, a brand of vodka. Entitled: Rachel Canning, left, threatened to sue her school after she was kicked out of her Homecoming Dance because she was strongly suspected of being drunk of vodka . Bragging: Rachel was heard bragging by teachers that she had a bottle of Everclear. They searched her car, didn't find any and the teacher who hauled her into an office was convinced she was drunk . Above the law: Rachel, pictured in her Homecoming Dance dress, felt she had a case against the teacher . She was hauled into a school office and questioned while teachers searched the car she had been standing near. They didn’t find any alcohol and she was cleared of drinking, but in Tuesday’s court hearing a lawyer representing Rachel’s parents Elizabeth and Sean revealed Mr Schillings had told them he was convinced she was drunk and would have been able to prove it ‘if he’d had a breathalizer’. Despite that Rachel was insistent she was completely innocent – even though she was suspended for two days in the aftermath of the incident. She was so angry that, according to her parents, she started to threaten legal action against Mr Schilling. In court documents seen by MailOnline, Elizabeth wrote: ‘Rachel also had starting threatening filing a lawsuit against Mr. Schilling from Morris Catholic for making her miss her Homecoming Dance’. Explaining the incident she went on: ‘On October 12, 2013 we were contacted by Morris Catholic High School, and spoke with Mr Schilling, who advised us that Rachel was suspected of drinking and had been heard bragging loudly, inside the Homecoming Dance, and having ‘Everclear’, a grain of vodka alcohol. ‘Mr Schilling relayed to us that Rachel had been seen in the parking lot with her boyfriend and several other boys acting in a suspicious manner, which caused the Morris Catholic authorities to search their vehicle. She added: ‘Mr Schilling also related to us that they had discovered plans for a post-homecoming dance alcohol party, presumably at our house, hosted by Rachel. Not impressed: The judge hearing her claim that her parents should pay her school fees and maintenance even though she refuses to live by their rules took a very dim view of her case . Support: Jon Inglesino is pictured with Rachel Canning at her hearing this week. The powerful attorney is funding her case and letting her stay at his mansion . ‘Rachel was suspended for this behavior for two days by Morris Catholic, being placed on probation for the rest of the fall semester and not being allowed to participate in the Peer Ministry Group because of her behavior.’ Rachel’s version of events was very different. She wrote: ‘There was an incident where I was accused of being intoxicated at my high school’s Homecoming dance. I was found not to be intoxicated.’ But her alleged reaction to threaten legal action seems to demonstrate the kind of mentality that has led her to sue her parents for maintenance, college bills and legal fees, after claiming they abandoned her. She even went on to allege that her mother was the cause of her bulimia because she called her 'porky' and that her father had an 'inappropriate affection' for her. However, Mrs Canning said the girl developed a 'hatred' for her mother because all she did was try to get her treatment for her eating disorder. And a Department of Children and Families investigation cleared Mr Canning of any claims of abuse, with Rachel's parents claiming an official assigned to the case came to the conclusion she was just 'spoiled'. Her pleas for immediate financial assistance were denied in a hearing at Morris County Court on Tuesday, but Judge Peter Bogaard set a trial date for April 22. Rachel’s controversial legal battle is being funded by the father of her best friend, millionaire lawyer Jon Inglesino. The Cannings believe he is enabling their daughter’s behavior and encouraging her to take the matter to court. She is currently living In their large mansion in Rockaway Township, New Jersey. War: Elizabeth and Sean Canning aren't just fighting with their daughter, but the Inglesinos - in whose home they claim Rachel had her first drink - and with the parents of her boyfriend Lucas Kitzmiller . Princess: Rachel even accused her mother of being the cause of her bulimia, claiming that Mrs Canning had called her 'porky' and 'fat'. Mrs Canning because she tried to help, Rachel developed a 'hatred' towards her . Sean Canning wrote: ‘The fact the Inglesino family has subsidized a lawsuit, rather than providing responsible guidance in abiding by a parent’s rules is not an acceptable society norm.’ Yesterday we revealed the parents claim in court papers that Inglesino, the managing partner at Inglesino, Wyciskala & Taylor and a member of Gov. Chris Christie’s School Funding Task Force – allegedly allowed Rachel to drink in his house. Apparently when Rachel was a 15-year-old freshman she got so drunk on vodka at Inglesino’s home that she was sick all over the sidewalk and into a garbage can after her dad Sean picked her up for a basketball game. And according to the Canning family, Inglesino’s wife Amy gave Rachel and her friends wine coolers in the back of a limo bound for New York on her daughter’s 15th birthday. In an excerpt from explosive court documents, Sean – a retired police chief from Lincoln Park – wrote: ‘The Inglesino household, according to Rachel in the past, is more lenient. She would often tell us how the Inglesino parents would allow alcoholic parties to be held at their house…. ‘Rachel’s first time drinking alcohol was at the Inglesino house, in March of 2011 and on other occasions including their daughter’s 15th birthday where they have freely provided alcohol. ‘Rachel came home bragging saying that during the limo ride to NY, Mrs Inglesino gave all the girls wine coolers to drink. This type of behavior we did not condone.’ The war of words between the Inglesinos and the Cannings is not the only family feud to have developed during the bitter legal dispute. On Wednesday MailOnline exclusively revealed that the parents of Rachel’s boyfriend Lucas Kitzmiller are furious the Cannings are blaming him for making her ‘obsessed with alcohol’ and getting her suspended from school. Corrupting? Lucas Kitzmiller, right, has been accused of leading Rachel astray with drink, parties and even getting her suspended from her Catholic High School in New Jersey . They also dragged his dad Jeffery and mom Lisa into the battle, saying they regularly brought the boozed-up pair home well after curfew, turning up at 3.30am on one occasion. They gave Rachel an ultimatum that she had to either split up with her boyfriend, or move out. In one exchange between the Catholic high School girl and her father last November she wrote: 'Well I'm not coming home if I can't see him'. Rachel refused to dump Lucas and actually moved in with his family for two nights, before relocating to the Inglesinos. But Jeffery Kitzmiller defended his son and his wife, Lisa. He said: ‘My son has been painted in a questionable light by some of the comments from the Cannings. 'Their only experience of him is that he met the father long enough to shake hands. That's the only interaction they have ever had. They made their decision about him from that. 'If you read the court papers you can see the trend is with every boyfriend she's had it's always the boyfriend who's the bad influence. We have been dragged into this.’ Rachel’s chances of winning against her parents look slim after Tuesday’s initial hearing, especially after her pleas for immediate financial aid were shot down in flames by Judge Bogaard. He was incredibly vocal in his criticism of the high school student. After reading an expletive-laden and vicious answerphone message left by Rachel, from Lincoln Park, New Jersey to her mother, in which the girl said: 'I wanna s*** all over your face', he said: 'Have you ever in your experience seen such gross disrespect for a parent? I don’t see it in my house.’ If looks could kill: Inglesino's children Jamie, left, and Lauren, right, glower at Rachel's father, Sean. The Cannings claim their daughter once came back from a party at the Inglesino house so drunk she vomited on the sidewalk . The judge added that Rachel had given her mom and dad: ‘The proverbial f you’. He also warned he must consider the 'slippery slope' where 'we open the gates for a 12-year-old to sue for an Xbox, a 13-year-old to sue for an iPhone… what about a 15-year-old asking for a 60 inch TV?' Yesterday a Facebook account called ‘Education for Rachel’ appeared, apparently set up by the controversial teen. Incendiary posts were made defending her position and attacking other groups such as baby boomers. One message read, ‘Educating children is first in parenting skills’. Hundreds of people, ‘liked’ the page and scores reacted with fury to her comments. But yesterday – despite certain media reports - Jon Inglesino confirmed to MailOnline that it was a fake account and had not been set up by Rachel. Around the same time a page called, ‘In Support for Sean and Elizabeth Canning’ was set up.","Rachel Canning's parents claim that the entitled teenager was so furious that her Homecoming dance was cut short that she wanted to sue the teacher who pulled her aside for drinking .

Ukip councillor and MEP candidate Donna Edmunds said companies must be allowed to refuse to serve people for whatever reason they want . Businesses should be allowed to turn women, gay or black people and refuse them service, a Ukip councillor has claimed. Donna Edmunds, who is also standing for election to the European Parliament, claimed firms should not be ‘forced to serve or sell to anyone’, but today expressed ‘regret’ at her remarks. It comes just days after Nigel Farage claimed his party’s candidates were of a 'quality and calibre' Ukip could be proud of. Miss Edmunds, an MEP candidate for the South East and a Lewes district councillor, posted the comments on an internet forum. She had been asked whether she supported remarks made by Henley-on-Thames Ukip councillor David Silvester who said the floods this winter had been caused by the Government's support for gay marriage. The mother of one claimed she did not agree with her party colleague but said business owners should be allowed to refuse service to anyone they wanted to for any reason, the paper said. She said: ‘I believe that all business owners, Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, should be allowed to withhold their services from whomever they choose whenever they choose. ‘It's their business. Why should they be forced to serve or sell to anyone?’ She later told reporters: ‘Business owners should be free to turn people away for whatever reason they choose - be they gay, black, or a woman. ‘I would not condone their actions, and would not shop in such a place. In fact, many people would probably choose not to shop there. ‘However, I am a libertarian and do not think the government should legislate against such things.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage has boasted that his party's candidates are of a higher 'calibre' than in the past . James Ledward, editor of GScene Gay . Magazine, described her views as ‘horrendous’. He said: ‘I’m . flabbergasted. There is no place for views like this in 2014.’ The . row comes despite attempts by Ukip to impose tougher tests on . candidates to prevent them embarrassing the party with controversial . views. When the 32-year-old was asked to clarify her statement, she told the Brighton Argus newspaper: ‘I'm a libertarian so I don't think the state should have a role on who business owners serve. Ukip councillor David Silvester claimed the winter storms were linked to gay marriage . ‘I wouldn't refuse to serve gay . people. I'm not saying their position is a correct one. I'm saying they . should be free to make that choice themselves. ‘I regret what I wrote and can see how an essentially libertarian stance could be broadly misinterpreted. ‘I in no way endorse any form of discrimination. I believe in cutting red tape for business and I also strongly believe in an individual's personal and religious freedoms, but I stand against any form of prejudice. ‘I hope this remark has not caused any embarrassment for the party.’ A Ukip spokesman said: ‘It would appear that these comments were deeply misguided and we do not endorse the position intimated, but we believe she has apologised for the remarks.’ Last week Mr Farage used a speech to the Ukip spring conference to insist the party had improved the quality of its candidates. He insisted his candidates could 'say what they like' because they represent a broad base of public opinion. He said: 'These elections, in many ways, will be an opportunity for us to tell the political class where to go.' The Ukip leader said that since the 2010 elections, candidates were now of a 'quality and calibre' the party could be proud of. He said: 'Despite repeated attempts to ridicule us, our people come from the real world, they've got real-life experiences, unlike the political classes.’","Donna Edmunds said firms should not be forced to serve or sell to anyone .

Getting old and frail is not something to look forward to, but NHS staff are to find out first-hand exactly how tough it can really be. A suit has been created to mimic some of the troubles facing the elderly, using weights and straps to restrict movement while headphones and special goggles recreate the debilitating loss of vision and hearing. All staff at the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, from porters to consultants, are to be given time in the ageing suit to give them a better insight into how their elderly and dementia patients feel when they try to perform basic tasks. Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust is using an age simulation suit to teach staff what it's like to be old . It follows the example of . Peterborough City Hospital, whose staff were recently trained in how to . improve their care for obese patients by wearing a fat suit that gave . them the shape of a 40stone person. Anita . Ruckledge, a senior sister, said: ‘The ageing suit allows us to . empathise with patients who have age-related symptoms or who suffer from . dementia. It’s a way of understanding just what everyday life is like . for them. ‘It gives an . insight into how the joints move as we get older and how it might be . difficult to do things that we take for granted. It can make patients . feel very out of control.’ Those . wearing the suit found that splints fitted to their legs and oversized . shoes make them shuffle along, while vibrating gloves mimic the symptoms . of conditions such as Parkinson’s. Those wearing the suit will find after five or ten minutes that they start to slouch due to the weight of it, and pads on their elbows and knees restrict joint movement. The suit is being used by everyone from porters to consultants. Image shows volunteer Harvey Pedley wearing the suit and being supported by Anita Ruckledge, dementia lead nurse and senior sister . Splints are fitted to the legs and over-sized shoes are worn to make the user shuffle as an elderly person may do. The gloves cause a tremor to mimic the symptoms of conditions such as Parkinson's disease. Other age-related impairments that the suit helps younger people experience include opacity of the eye lens, narrowing of the visual field, head mobility restrictions and joint stiffness. They will also feel a loss of strength, reduced grip ability and reduced co-ordination skills, while also having high-frequency hearing loss. Suzanne Brassett, a ward sister on the dementia ward at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, has worn the age simulation suit to allow her to get a better understanding of how her patients are feeling. The suit includes goggles and ear defenders to simulate hearing and vision loss and a neck brace to restrict head movement and replicate a stiff neck . The suit also includes heavy shoes which cause the wearer to shuffle as some elderly people do . Ms Brassett said: ‘The suit can actually make you understand how patients feel. ‘When patients say “I can't pick that up” or something you can completely empathise with them, and often by putting yourself in their shoes, you can help them to find a way. ‘It's not a nice feeling wearing the suit. I walked around a shopping centre in it and to not be able to see and not hear at the same time was really hard. You really do have to rely on everyone around you. ‘I would definitely recommend for anyone to try wearing it, because we all come across elderly people in our lives. For members of the public to try it as well would help all of us understand how it feels.’ The suit comes with gloves which cause the hands to shake and which make picking things up hard . Anita Ruckledge, senior sister at Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'The suit really allows us to empathise with patients who have age related symptoms or who suffer from dementia' The trust is supporting a nationwide drive to improve care of people with dementia across the country, and is investing in training by enabling all staff to take part in free dementia training courses. Deputy Associate Director of Nursing for Medicine, Helen Green said: ‘We want to make the trust a centre of excellence for dementia treatment. ‘This is part of our on-going drive to improve our care and make the most vulnerable patients get the attention and the support that they need. ‘We also want to reassure family and friends of patients that we are doing everything in our power to provide them with the support they need and deserve at what can be a difficult time.’","Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust is using the suit to teach all staff - from porters to consultants - how their elderly patients feel .

Students at a Washington college have launched a petition to save a rare $250,000 Dodge Viper, likening the decision to scrap the car to losing a beloved family pet. The automotive students at the South Puget Sound Community College were told the 1992 model must be destroyed, after car manufacturers Chrysler deemed it no longer has any educational value. Professor Norman Chapman told ABC News: 'It's like taking a family pet, putting it in front of kids and destroying it.' Scroll down for video . Consigned to the scrap heap: The rare Dodge Viper was donated to a Washington college for educational purposes but manufacturer Chrysler now wants it scrapped . The car was donated to the college eight years ago by Chrysler, to enable students to use the car as part of their studies. 'We destroy cars all of the time, but that's usually because they have lost their educational value,' Mr Chapman said. 'This here is kind of unique and the students are definitely up in arms about it. It has around 600 horse power and it will go 200 mph really easy. It's definitely a race car. There are no frills in it, but it's definitely a speed machine.' The college were told of the decision by email this week. The message simply told school officials that Chrysler plan to 'eliminate all Dodge Vipers from its educational donations fleet'. The manufacturer has given the school two weeks to scrap the car, and has requested proof that it has been scrapped. The car is also used to attract high school student's to take up the college's courses. 'It's a much beloved car on campus,' Dean of College Relations Kellie Purce Braseth said. But students have launched a petition to try and save the car, and have it installed in a museum. Outrage: Students at the South Puget Sound Community College have launched a petition to try and save the car, which is 'much beloved on campus', according to school officials . Prof Chapman said it is unlikely the campaign will prove successful, unless the students gain presidential pardon, or the state's governor's support. Chrylser said while they do preserve many models for historic purposes, the Viper does not fall into this category. The college said they do not know the reason for the order, but added Chrysler are within their rights to order the car's destruction, under the terms of a contract signed when the car was donated. Prof Chapman said there were rumours circulating that similar cars had 'got loose' at other schools, and had been involved in accidents. A Chrysler spokesman said it is 'standard procedure' as part of the donation process for the company to order cars be destroyed. He said whenever cars are donated to colleges, they are done so on the basis that they are scrapped once they no longer offer any educational value. The statement said: 'With advancements in automotive technology over the past decade, it is unlikely that these vehicles offer any educational value to students. 'Chrysler Group has no record of any . legal proceedings involving Dodge Viper vehicles donated to educational . institutions being involved in accidents and product liability . lawsuits.' The Viper in question was the fourth off the production line and one of the first hardtop models to be made. The car is so rare, Jay Leno once tried to buy it from Chrysler. But the presenter was told they could not sell it to him because it is not street legal.","Car was donated to South Puget Sound Community College eight years ago .

The . money finally ran out, leading to the grim discovery of the woman's . mummified body lying on the back seat of a Jeep Liberty registered to . Farrenkopf inside the garage. Undersheriff . Mike McCabe told Detroit Free Press that investigators believe the . woman has been dead since at least 2008. That’s the year the license . plate on Farrenkopf's Jeep expired. The . body was clothed in a heavy jacket and jeans, leading investigators to . believe that it was winter when she died. The key was in the ignition, . but it was switched to the off position. Investigators . are treating the death as a homicide at this time and say suicide by . carbon monoxide seems unlikely. The body shows no signs of trauma, . McCabe says. Crime scene? A woman was found mummified in the backseat of her Jeep inside the garage of her Detroit home and she may have been there for upwards of three years . Dr Bernadino Pacris, the Oakland . County deputy medical examiner, said the skin was intact on the corpse, . but the internal organs had decomposed. Climate, weather and humidity play a role in preserving a body in such a way, he said. The . medical examiner's office is awaiting toxicology results and hopes to . find dental records to identify whether the corpse is Farrenkopf. Neighbors of Farrenkopf's on Savanna St said they never noticed anything amiss. The woman lived alone and kept to herself, often disappearing for days or weeks on business. According . to the Detroit News, Farrenkopf was a contractor with Chrysler's . financing division before her employment was terminated in September . 2008. Investigation: The body was found when a contractor went into the home because it is going into foreclosure . Unpaid bills: Mail for Pia Farrenkopf on the snowy driveway to the home she once owned . Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said that detectives had spoken to a sister of Farrenkopf in Boston, who told them that the two were estranged and had not spoken in years. Farrenkopf's sister said that the Chrysler job had been the reason for her sister's move from Massachusetts to Detroit. Neighbor Darryl Tillery, 49, said the woman’s mail never piled up at the house and her lawn was kept neat. Neighbor Darryl Tillery talks about Pia Farrenkopf, and says there were no outward signs that she had died more than five years ago and was lying in her garage . 'It was pretty manicured,' he told the Detroit Free Press. 'There was no indication there was a body in there, at all.' Some believed they no longer saw Farrenkopf because she had moved to Germany, something she had indicated that she intended to do. Many left the area after the economy crashed in 2009 wand they could no longer afford their mortgage payments. The outside of the home was fairly well maintained, but inside a black mold had taken over, McCabe said. WXYZ reports that Farrenkopf's stepfather Edward Caroll, said she was estranged from her family. Caroll married Farrenkopf’s mother three years ago. He said Pia Farrenkopf never answered the wedding invitation. 'I tried to find her through the Internet and everything and I never could find her.  And I wrote a letter a couple times and I think some of them came back. Her mother hadn’t heard from her for years and years.' Farrenkopf's mother died a year and a half ago.","Mummified body found in garage believed to belong to Pia Farrenkopf, 49, the owner of the home .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . PUBLISHED: . 14:45 EST, 7 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 14:56 EST, 7 January 2014 . The skeleton of an unusual primate, which some have claimed to be the oldest member of the human family tree, has baffled scientists since it was discovered. Short, hairy and with long arms, she roamed the forests of Africa 4.4million years ago, but scientists were unsure whether she was more closely related to humans than to apes. Now a team of international scientists seeking to unravel whether the African species helps to explain the origins of man, believe Ardipithecus ramidus really is related to the human lineage, based on an examination of its cranial base. This is the 4.4 million-year-old cranial base of Ardipithecus ramidus from Aramis, Middle Awash research area, Ethiopia. Ardi's cranial base (pictured) shows the distinguishing features that separate humans and Australopithecus from the apes, the researchers said . The creature, known as Ardi, possessed a tiny brain and a grasping big toe for climbing trees, but had small, human-like canine teeth and an upper pelvis allowing it to walk like man. Experts believe Ardi is very, very close to the 'missing link' common ancestor of humans and chimps, thought to have lived five to seven million years ago. Now new research led by William Kimbel, a palaeoanthropologist at the University of Arizona, has confirmed Ardi’s close evolutionary relationship to humans. Together with a group of international . researchers, he studied the base of the Ardi’s partial cranium to . reveal a pattern of similarity that links Ardi to Australopithecus and . modern humans and not to apes. Professor . Kimbel said: ‘Given the very tiny size of the Ardi skull, the . similarity of its cranial base to a human's is astonishing.’ Ardi's skeleton (left) revealed she was 4ft tall and weighed 7st 12oz. She lived a million years before Lucy, the previous earliest skeleton of a hominid who was dug up in 1974. Experts believe Ardi (illustrated right) is very close . to the 'missing link' common ancestor of humans and chimps . The human cranial base is substantially different to that of apes and other primates, which is why it is a valuable resource for studying phylogenetic, or natural evolutionary relationships. Its anatomical complexity and association with the brain, posture, and chewing system have provided numerous opportunities for adaptive evolution over time. In humans, the structures marking the articulation of the spine with the skull are more forwardly located than in apes, the base is shorter from front to back and the openings on each side for passage of blood vessels and nerves are more widely separated. These shape differences affect the way the bones are arranged on the skull base, so it is fairly easy for experts to work out if even isolated bone fragments belong to an ape or human. Scientists have questioned whether Ardi . was an ape with a few humanlike features retained from an ancestor . living between six and eight years ago, or a true relative of the human . line that had yet to shed signs of its remote tree-dwelling ancestry. Ardi was found in Ethiopia's Afar Rift (pictured) and bones discovered near the skeleton indicate that at the time it was a wooded environment. Fossils of 29 species of birds and 20 species of small mammals were found at the site . In the study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, the researchers explained that Ardi's cranial base shows the distinguishing features that separate humans and Australopithecus from the apes. Professor Kimbel's earlier research had shown that these human peculiarities were present in the earliest known Australopithecus skulls by 3.4 million years ago. Paleoanthropologists generally fall into one of two camps on the cause of evolutionary changes in the human cranial base. They believe they could either be explained by the adoption of upright posture and the ability to walk on two legs causing a shift in the poise of the head on the vertebral column or be a sign of brain reorganisation in the human lineage. 'The Ardi cranial base fills some important gaps in our understanding of human evolution above the neck,’ Professor Kimbel said. ‘But it opens up a host of new questions…just as it should!’ The scattered skeleton of Ardi was . first discovered in Ethiopia’s Afar Rift in 1994 and the skull was . crushed to just two inches in height. However, . it was found to be relatively complete with features of the head, hands . and feet preserved after researchers took years to painstakingly piece . together 125 fragments of bone. Before . the discovery, scientists believed our common ancestor would have been . very chimp-like, and that ancient hominids such as Ardi would still have . much in common with them. Digital representations of Ardi's skull (left) and hand (right) The scattered skeleton of Ardi was first discovered in Ethiopia's Afar Rift in1994 and the skull was crushed to just two inches in height. Years of painstaking work by scientists manged to put the pieces together . But she was not suited like a modern-day chimp to swinging or hanging from trees or walking on her knuckles. This suggests that chimps and gorillas developed those characteristics after the split with humans - challenging the idea that they are merely an 'unevolved' version of us. Ardi's feet were rigid enough to allow her to walk upright some of the time, but she still had a grasping big toe for use in climbing trees. She had long arms but short palms and fingers which were flexible, allowing her to support her body weight on her palms. Her upper canine teeth are more like the stubby teeth of modern people than the long, sharp ones of chimps. An analysis of her tooth enamel suggests she ate fruit, nuts and leaves. Scientists believe she was a female because her skull is relatively small and lightly built. Her teeth were also smaller than other members of the same family that were found later. Conventional wisdom says our earliest ancestors first stood up on two legs when they moved out of the forest and into the open savannas. But this does not explain why Ardi's species was bipedal (able to walk on two legs) while still living partly in the trees. Owen Lovejoy from Kent State University said the answer could be as simple as food and sex. He pointed out that throughout evolution males have fought with other males for the right to mate with fertile females. Therefore you would expect dominant males with big fierce canines to pass their genes down the generations. But say a lesser male, with small stubby teeth realised he could entice a fertile female into mating by bringing her some food? Males would be far more successful food-providers if they had their hands free to carry home items like fruit and roots if they walked on two legs. Mr Lovejoy said this could explain why males from Ardi's species had small canines and stood upright - it was all in the pursuit of sex. He added that it could also suggest that monogamous relationships may be far older than was first thought.","Research led by University of Arizona confirmed Ardi’s close evolutionary relationship to humans by examining its skull .

Robert Brown, 58, from Jersey, has won permission to appeal against a court ruling that he has no right to see Princess Margaret's will . A man who claims to be Princess Margaret’s  illegitimate son yesterday won a significant legal  victory in his battle to see the contents of her will. Jersey accountant Robert Brown, 58, who also wants to see the Queen Mother’s will,  is seeking to prove he is Margaret’s secret child and that she hid the pregnancy. The Queen’s sister died in  February 2002 and her mother the following month. The wills were drawn up around the time of  Margaret’s death and were ‘sealed’ to keep their contents secret. Yesterday Mr Brown was granted permission to seek judicial review of a refusal to allow him access under the Freedom of Information Act to documents he claims show there was a ‘secret judicial process’ for sealing royal wills. Mr Justice Phillips said at London’s High Court the case gave rise ‘to important points of principle and practice’ regarding open justice and the public interest. Mr Brown’s quest to prise open the wills and prove his royal heritage goes back decades. He believes he was born to Princess Margaret in 1955 and his father was possibly Robin Douglas-Home, a Scottish aristocrat and author who died in 1968. He claims the later stages of pregnancy were covered up using body doubles and that he was sent to Kenya to be brought up as the child of Cynthia and  Douglas Brown. He believes the documents he wants disclosed will reveal that Buckingham Palace, the Attorney General and a senior judge acted together to maintain secrecy around the Queen’s sister’s last testament, which, he hopes,  contain details of his birth. His claims were dismissed by lawyers for the Royal Family in a previous court hearing as those of ‘a fantasist seeking to feed his private obsession’. But he insists he has the right to find out if the Queen’s sister was his mother. Records show Mr Brown was born on January 5, 1955, in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, but his birth was not registered until February 2. He believes it is  significant that a Privy Council meeting was held on the day he was born. Later that year  Princess Margaret called off her wedding to Peter Townsend. Parents?  Mr Brown believes he may be the son of Robin Douglas Home, left, and Princess Margaret . His parents, now dead, are registered . as Cynthia and Douglas Brown. He claims Cynthia was a model working for . Hardy Amies, a favoured designer of the Princess. Mr Brown has . previously told the Guardian the couple were distant compared with how . they treated his supposed siblings. He added that as a child his . birthday would sometimes be forgotten. He . came to the High Court to seek disclosure of Margaret’s will in 2006 . and 2007 when Sir Mark Porter, president of the Family Division, said it . was an ‘imaginary and baseless claim’. Mr . Brown lost but has returned to the battle under freedom of information . laws. He argues there was ‘a secret agreement between the Palace and . Attorney General as to how the court should approach the exercise of . its  judicial discretion as to whether or not to seal a particular royal . will’. He asserts that Dame . Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, then president of the High Court Family . Division, approved the contents of the agreement as ‘constituting the . applicable guidance of the judiciary on the practice and procedure to be . applied in the context of an application to have a royal will sealed’. Legal victory: Mr Brown said: 'Hopefully I am not a nutcase.  I am either right or I am wrong.' But . the guidance was never made available for public scrutiny, raising . questions over whether it is unlawful and  constitutional, says Mr . Brown. His attempts to seek . disclosure of the guidance were previously ruled out on the grounds that . the disputed information fell into the category of ‘royal . correspondence’ and was exempt from inspection under freedom of . information laws. But yesterday Mr Justice  Phillips ruled that Mr Brown’s case was ‘arguable’ and should go to a full hearing. Mr . Brown said later: ‘I am absolutely delighted. It is an important day . for the fundamental principles of open justice and the rule of law. Historically it has been very clear that the monarchy should not have . secret communications with the court.’ Of his claim to royal parentage, he said: ‘Hopefully I am not  a nutcase. I am either right or  I am wrong.’","Robert Brown, 58, believes the Queen's sister hid her pregnancy in 1955 .

Six people have been killed in Kiev and . other Ukrainian cities in protests that erupted more than two months ago . after President Viktor Yanukovich walked away from a treaty with the . European Union under pressure from Russia. Protesters have occupied key buildings in various cities, set up encampments in squares and erected barricades in streets. Under the conditions of the amnesty these would have to be dismantled and buildings vacated. It allows for peaceful protests, though. Scroll down for video .

However, protesters aren't in the mood to stand down. ‘These laws are a lie and people don't trust them,’ Oleh, a protester from Kiev, told Channel 4 News. He added: ‘People were defending their constitutional rights and we actually don't understand what we need an amnesty.’ The amnesty offer follows several other concessions tabled by President Viktor Yanukovych, which included accepting the resignation of Prime Minister Mykola Azarov. However, the opposition won’t budge and is demanding that Yanukovych himself stands down. So far he’s refused to do so, but isn’t currently fulfilling his duties as he’s been taken ill with severe flu. A demonstrator has a meal near a fire at a barricade erected by anti-government protesters near the site of clashes with riot police in Kiev . Tents of anti-government protesters are seen at Independence Square in central Kiev . A statement from his office said: ‘The president is on sick leave with acute respiratory disease accompanied by an elevated temperature.’ There was no indication of how long he might be on leave. Meanwhile, the Obama administration is preparing financial sanctions that could be imposed on Ukrainian officials and protest leaders if violence escalates, according to Reuters. Congressional aides, who asked not to be identified by name because of the sensitive subject, said they had discussed the sanction preparations with administration officials. Self-defence troops rally in Kiev on January 29, marking the 96th anniversary of a 1918 battle near the small city of Kruty .

Anti-government protesters wait for a decision on the amnesty law at a barricade in Kiev . Vice President Joe Biden has spoken to Yanukovich at least three times. And two U.S. senators, Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut, traveled to Kiev last month and addressed demonstrations. The House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday passed a resolution calling on all sides in the confrontation to refrain from violence and work toward a peaceful resolution. ‘The situation in Ukraine remains very volatile and more needs to be done,’ said Representative Eliot Engel, the New York Democrat who sponsored the resolution. ‘We must remain engaged.’ Head of the Ukrainian UDAR (Punch) party Vitali Klitschko speaks on Independence Square in Kiev early on Thursday . However, U.S. lawmakers and Obama administration officials said they were encouraged by recent developments, including the Ukrainian parliament's vote to repeal anti-protest laws. ‘We were encouraged that Ukraine's parliament repealed the most egregious of the most anti-democratic laws. Today we want to urge President Yanukovich to sign the repeal laws,’ State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said at a news briefing. She told reporters the State Department has been willing to consider sanctions but no decision has been made. Alarm has grown elsewhere in the West. German Chancellor Angela Merkel telephoned Russian President Vladimir Putin and Yanukovich on Wednesday, urging a constructive dialogue between the government and opposition. Putin raised the pressure on Ukraine on Wednesday, saying Russia would wait until Ukraine forms a new government before fully implementing a $15billion bailout deal that Kiev urgently needs.","President Yanukovych has 'acute respiratory disease' and a temperature .

It only took a few hours for a bipartisan congressional push against Iran's nuclear ambitions to become Oval Office roadkill on Thursday, as the White House insisted that President Barack Obama will veto any effort to introduce new sanctions on the Islamic republic while the State Department works its diplomatic levers. A group of 13 Democrats and 13 Republicans in the U.S. Senate introduced a bill that would levy tough new penalties on Iran if it fails to prove by May that it has terminated its nuclear weapons program. But in his afternoon press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Obama would have no patience with congressional efforts to put pressure on Iranian President Hassan Rouhani during a period of negotiation designed to bring his country's nuclear program out in the open. 'We don't think this action is necessary,' Carney told reporters. 'We donâ€™t think it will be enacted. If it were enacted, the president would veto it.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Restless: Congress is growing wary of Iran's nuclear disarmament promises, and now 26 senators are calling for new threats of sanctions if President Hassan Rouhani doesn't follow through . Trouble ahead: The Emergency Committee for Israel lashed out at President Obama for threatening a veto of new legislation that would all but guarantee U.S. support of Tel Aviv's military strikes on Tehran . Denied: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney left little doubt that Obama would veto the Senate bill, saying the threat of new sanctions could being Iran closer to war footing . The president's chief spokesman echoed other . administration officials' complaints that threats of a new round of . sanctions could drive Iran away from the bargaining table and perhaps . put the nation on war footing with the U.S. and Israel. The Senate bill would 'greatly increase the chances that the United States would have to take military action' against Iran, he claimed. 'It would potentially divide the international community and obviously would suggest bad faith on the part of the United States.' But that view doesn't square with more than one-quarter of the Senate. Foreign Relations Chairman Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, and Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican, introduced the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2013 earlier in the day, along with 24 other co-sponsors. 'Current sanctions brought Iran to the negotiating table,' Menendez said Thursday, 'and a credible threat of future sanctions will require Iran to cooperate and act in good faith.' 'The burden rests with Iran to negotiate in good faith and verifiably terminate its nuclear weapons program,' he said. Kirk called the legislation 'a responsible, bipartisan bill to protect the American people from Iranian deception.' 'The American people rightfully distrust Iran's true intentions,' he added, 'and they deserve an insurance policy to defend against Iranian deception.' Maverick, Jr.: Sen. Bob Menendez is getting a reputation for bucking his own party, most recently with a bill designed to force President Obama's hand during tense negotiations with Iran . It's unclear whether Majority Leader Harry Reid will advance the bill to the Senate floor for a vote, even if it gains momentum and a host of new co-sponsors. Believable? Rouhani has publicly pledged to open up his uranium enrichment sites to inspectors and slow production, while privately telling his countrymen that it will be business as usual in Iran's nuclear program . But with more than a dozen Democrats . in direct conflict with the White House's policy on Iran, the stage has . been set for a Washington, D.C. conflict that the Iranians will likely . watch unfold on CNN. One aide to a senator who co-sponsored the bill told Politico that the White 's concerns about new hostilities between Iran and the west is 'a false choice.' 'The supporters of the bill believe it makes war less likely,' the staffer said: 'Sanctions brought us this far, and the threat of additional sanctions can help us force Iran to get rid of their nuclear weapons in the negotiations.' The Senate bill would forbid the Obama administration from waiving any congressionally approved sanctions unless the U.S. and its allies have 'reached a final and verifiable agreement or arrangement with Iran that will ... dismantle Iran's illicit nuclear infrastructure, including enrichment and reprocessing capabilities and facilities.' Congress could also block sanctions waivers, according to an analysis by Foreign Policy magazine, 'by passing a ""joint resolution of disapproval"" against a final deal.' The legislation also features a a non-binding promise that if Israel were to take 'military action in legitimate self-defense against Iran's nuclear weapons program,' the U.S. 'should stand with Israel and provide... diplomatic, military, and economic support to the Government of Israel in its defense of its territory, people, and existence.' Hot seat: Secretary of State John Kerry has to continue overseeing negotiations while the Senate committee he once chaired wrangles internally over whether to add more fuel to his fire . The White House's veto threat is already hitting home with Israel's supporters in Washington. The Emergency Committee for Israel quickly labeled the Senate effort 'carefully considered legislation intended to prevent a nuclear Iran.' 'The Obama administration immediately threatened to veto the legislation,' the group said in a statement, 'and falsely accuses its sponsors of engaging in a rush to war. In fact the White House has responded in far harsher terms to these members of Congress than it has to an Iranian regime which continues to enrich uranium, prevent monitoring of its nuclear program, and still refuses to implement the Geneva agreement negotiated last month.' Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif told Time magazine this month that new sanctions, including penalties slated to take effect after November's six-month interim agreement expires, would eliminate the chance for a more comprehensive nuclear bargain.","13 Senate Democrats and 13 from the Republican side proposed tough new sanctions on Iran if it doesn't follow through on nuclear promises .

Syrian government forces have dropped barrel bombs on rebel-held districts of Aleppo killing 13 people, including children, according to a monitoring group. The latest slaughter came just hours after both sides congratulated themselves for 'positive' developments at peace talks in Geneva, following four days without a breakthrough. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the new government offensive saw barrel-bombings in the Maadi and Salhin districts of south Aleppo, and separate gun battles on the main road toward the city's Nairab airbase and near the famous Crusader castle Krak des Chevaliers. Victim: A Syrian man carries the body of a child out of the rubble of a destroyed building following barrel bomb air raids by government forces on rebel-held parts of Aleppo . A woman and at least one child were killed in Maadi when helicopter forces loyal to Syria's President Assad dropped controversial barrel bombs on the residential neighbourhood. The attacks are likely to have a negative effect on ongoing peace talks between the two sides, which only hours earlier were hailed as a 'positive step forward' by a negotiator for the rebels. Louay Safi, a spokesman for the opposition's negotiating team, said the government delegation stuck to its demand that putting an end to terrorism remains its number one priority but added that it should be taken as a good sign that a change in government is now being openly discussed by both sides. Even before today's barrel bomb attacks, the credibility of the supposed breakthrough was being called into question, as both sides continue to blame each other for not taking the talks further. Contradiction: Only hours earlier, Louay Safi, a spokesman for the opposition's negotiating team hailed a 'positive step forward' in ongoing peace talks in Geneva . Syrians inspect the rubble of a destroyed building following barrel bomb air raids by government forces on the rebel-controlled part of Aleppo's Maadi residential district . Even before today's barrel bomb attacks, the credibility of a supposed breakthrough in the Geneva Peace Talks (pictured) was being called into question . The peace talks will come to a close of Friday, with today's attacks seen by many as confirmation there will not be a significant breakthrough before the negotiators leave Geneva. According to Safi, the government is now more willing to discuss the issue of Assad stepping down but he admitted it was still a subject they seem keen to push 'to the back of the discussion'. Rebel spokesman Louay Safi said the government is now more willing to discuss Assad stepping down . Bouthaina Shaaban, an adviser to Syrian President Bashar Assad, confirmed that both sides touched on the issue, but described today's talks as constructive for another reason. 'The talks have been positive today actually because they spoke about terrorism,' she said. A deal to allow humanitarian aid into the besieged central city of Homs remains on ice, with the Syrian delegation demanding assurances the aid will not go to 'armed and terrorist groups' in the city. The talks were cut short yesterday over the U.S. decision to restart deliveries of nonlethal aid to the Syrian opposition, more than a month after al-Qaida-linked militants seized warehouses and prompted a sudden cutoff of Western supplies to the rebels. The officials said the communications equipment and other items are being funneled only to non-armed opposition groups, but the move boosts Syria's beleaguered rebels, who saw their international support slide, in large part because of the extremists among their ranks. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimated that 1,200 women, children and elderly people are trapped in besieged areas of the old quarter of Homs. Alongside the new government offensive, there was fresh fighting between ideologically opposed rebel factions in the town of Al Bab, where moderate fighters clashed with members of the jihadist Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.","Deadly air raids occur just hours after supposed 'peace talk breakthrough'

The European Space Agency’s (ESA) huge horn is part of the most powerful sound system in Europe. But, according to the agency, no human can survive hearing it when it is turned to its maximum volume. Instead, the massive machine, which is used to blast satellites and spacecraft with sound, is shut away behind reinforced walls. Engineer Kees van Zijtveldt (pictured) stands beside the largest sound horn of ESA's Large European Acoustic Facility (Leaf), which is capable of subjecting satellites and spacecraft to the same noise a launcher produces as it takes off and flies through the atmosphere . Any sound above 85 Decibels can cause hearing loss in humans and the pain threshold is between 120 and 130 Decibels, according to Listverse. A 400,000 watt speaker used at rock concerts can generate around 135 Decibels of noise. Theoretically, fireworks and gunfire can create a staggering 145 Decibels but you can't stand next to them to be exposed to that level of sound and survive. The call of the blue whale reaches levels of up to 188 decibels so it can travel for hundreds of miles under water. Humans tend to stand around half a mile away from a shuttle launch as if they were very close they would be exposed to up to 170 Decibels of sound. ESA's Leaf sound system can generate over 154 decibels of noise. ESA's Large European Acoustic Facility (Leaf) is used to subject satellites to the same level of noise as a rocket makes when it takes off and flies though the atmosphere. It is housed at ESA’s ESTEC Test centre where there is a collection of spaceflight simulation facilities, in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. One wall of the sound chamber that houses the massive horn stands 16.4metres tall and 11metres wide by nine metres deep. Nitrogen shot through the horns can produce a range of noise up to more than 154 Decibels – which is like standing close to multiple jets taking off. The Herschel spacecraft (pictured) successfully passed its acoustic tests in June 2008. During the tests it was subjected to acoustic noise generated by the Leaf sound system . That level of noise is more than enough to permanently deafen a human. To prevent this from happening, it can only be operated when all the safety doors are closed – so that no human will ever hear the true power of the vast stereo system. Steel-reinforced concrete walls are used to safely contain its noise. They are coated with epoxy resin to reflect noise to produce a uniform sound field within the chamber. The room of sound is also supported on rubber bearing pads to isolate it from its surroundings. Extremely high-power sound waves can disrupt or destroy the eardrums and cause severe pain or disorientation. Less powerful sound waves can cause humans to experience nausea or discomfort. The use of these frequencies to incapacitate people has been used both in counter-terrorist and crowd-control settings. The possibility of a device that produces a frequency that causes vibration of the eyeballs - and therefore distortion of vision - has also been shown to work. High-amplitude sound of a specific pattern at a frequency close to the sensitivity peak of human hearing (2-3 kHz) is used as a burglar deterrent. Some police forces have used sound cannons against protesters, for example during the G20 summit in Pittsburgh. 'Acoustic grenades' generate between 120 decibels and 190 decibels. German researchers showed that a blast of 210 decibels or more affects the inner organs and can cause internal injury that could lead to death. A blast impacts the body, and does so very violently.","Large European Acoustic Facility sound system is capable of generating more than 154 Decibels and is housed in a special room in the Netherlands .

Apple products don't have the best track record when it comes to battery life, so it's no surprise the firm is said to be looking at alternative ways to power future devices - especially its iWatch. Reports in the New York Times claim the first-generation smartwatch will be charged wirelessly, using existing technologies currently used with select smartphones and cases. Yet future models of the wrist-worn technology may even be powered by solar or kinetic energy to make sure they never lose charge. Scroll down for video . Apple is rumoured to be working on an alternative way to charge its much-rumoured iWatch, concept pictured, to remove the need for wires and chargers. Reports claim the first model will be charged wirelessly, while future models may be powered by solar or kinetic energy . Speculation around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013. Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget. It was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone. Other . rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let . users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen. The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet. In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch. Further . reports in September claimed Apple was struggling to make a number of . iWatch components, meaning the release date would be pushed back. Solar panels could be fitted underneath the display of the iWatch, for example, and harness the sun's energy. Casio, . for example, already uses solar technology in its G-Shock range of . watches that can receive thermal and electrical energy and use it to . recharge watch batteries through solar panels on the face of the watch. This is further supported by the fact that in September, Apple posted a job vacancy looking for someone with solar expertise. Other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen and run the next-generation of Apple software, likely to be called iOS 8. All these current claims back up the plans laid out in an Apple patent filed in 2011. The patent described a 'wearable accessory device' with a 'flexible display' that could use the same technology as a child's slap wrap to mount a flexible touchscreen on a user's wrist. It also detailed a method in which the battery life could be extended, including a 'solar panel array spread across a surface of the accessory device', or 'a kinetic power source similar to those found on some wristwatches.' These current claims confirm plans laid out in an 2011 Apple patent. The patent described a 'wearable device' with a 'flexible display' that could use the same technology as a child's slap wrap, patent image pictured. Its battery life could be extended, using a 'solar panel array', or 'a kinetic power source . Other watchmakers, including Casio, already use solar technology in their products. For example, the Casio G-Shock, pictured, can receive thermal and electrical energy and use it to recharge watch batteries through solar panels on the face of the watch . 'An accessory device designed to be worn . on a leg or arm could greatly benefit from this sort of power . generation, and could lengthen the amount of time between charging,' the . application continued. Similarly, a patent filed in 2009 . detailed how Apple wanted to harness kinetic energy from the movement of . an arm or leg as the wearer was walking. The . curved screen and design rumours were bolstered by a further patent, awarded . last year, which gave Apple the option to install a flexible battery . into future products. Last week, reports claimed Samsung was also looking at adding a curved screen to its own next-generation smartwatch, dubbed Galaxy Gear 2. The original watch launched in September last year and was heavily criticised for its chunky design and poor battery life. Elsewhere, other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen, similar to the concept images pictured, and run the next-generation of Apple software, likely to be called iOS 8 . Some analysts claimed the device was . rushed out to make sure it was one of the first on the market, beating . Apple and Google to their respective rumoured devices. Whereas . Apple may have delayed its own smartwatch release to learn as much . about what customers liked, and didn't like, in the Samsung version. Since . the first Apple iWatch rumours emerged in 2012, a number of . artists have created concept images of what it may look like. Many resembled the square and clunky design of Samsung’s Galaxy . Gear, yet the latest images from Californian designer Todd Hamilton imagine a much more sleek and elegant curved device. Hamilton . took inspiration from fitness bands, as well as the look and . functionality of Apple’s iOS7, to create a watch that is ‘like something . Apple would actually produce.' The concept watch is shown as a simple band, fitted round the wrist like the Nike Fuelband, with a curved touchscreen. Previous iWatch concept images, including this one from MacUser magazine, featured a square screen, and a clunky design, that more closely resembled Samsung's Galaxy Gear smartwatch . Samsung beat Apple to the smartwatch market when it released its Android-powered Galaxy Gear, pictured, in September. However, its design, functionality and battery life has been heavily criticised and experts believe Apple may have delayed its iWatch release to learn more about what customers like, and don't like .","Reports claim the first-generation Apple iWatch will be wirelessly charged .

Egypt's toppled president shouted angrily at a judge today as he appeared in court on charges of breaking out of prison in 2011.

On trial: State television shows President Mohammed Morsi standing trial on charges of breaking out of jail . Standing guard: Morsi was among 22 defendants to appear at a makeshift courtroom in a police academy on the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt, today. Above, armed anti-riot police officers stand guard outside the academy . The former Islamist president then told judges that he remains Egypt's legitimate leader, according to a state television reporter inside the courtroom. He also expressed anger at being in a cage, raising his hands in the . air and yelling in . apparent disbelief: 'Do you know where I am?' - to which, judge Shabaan el-Shami responded: 'I am the head of Egypt's criminal court'. Morsi was among 22 defendants to go on trial at the academy, which is situated to the east of the capital. Others include members of his now-banned Muslim Brotherhood, such as his supreme guide, Mohamed Badie. The case is rooted in the escape of more than 20,000 inmates from . Egyptian prisons . during the early days of the 18-day uprising against  dictator Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Morsi and other Brotherhood leaders escaped two days after they were detained . three years ago as Mubarak's security forces tried to undercut the . planned protests. At the time, authorities also cut off Internet . access and mobile phone networks, crippling communication among the . protesters and with the outside world. Case: Dressed in a white prison uniform, Morsi stood in a metal cage with members of his now-banned Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Badie. His appearance comes amid a wave of violent attacks on security officials . Attack: His appearance comes as British holidaymakers are repeatedly told to stay indoors in Egypt's capital after 80 people died during a weekend of street clashes. Above, protestors throw stones and glass at police . In aired edited footage of today's trial, defendants could be seen chanting that the case was 'invalid'. They are also alleged to have turned their back to the court to protest . their prosecution, according to the state television journalist. Meanwhile, . a prosecutor told the court that Morsi and the Brotherhood's acts 'were . committed with the terrorist aim of terrifying the public and . spreading chaos'. He added that they had plotted with foreign . groups to 'undermine the Egyptian state and its institutions.' The trial coincided with the third . anniversary of one of the most violent days of that revolution that . plunged the country into prolonged turmoil, and that eventually led to . the virtual collapse of the police and their withdrawal from the . streets. It is second time . Morsi has appeared in court since the coup. At his first appearance in . November, Morsi wore a trim, dark suit and appeared far less agitated, . though he interrupted the judge and gave long speeches, declaring . forcefully that he was 'the president of the republic'. Deaths: Supporters of Egypt's army and police at Tahrir Square, on the third anniversary of Egypt's uprising . Help: Supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi carry an injured demonstrator who was shot during clashes in Cairo . At . the time, he had emerged from a four months detention in an undisclosed . location, appearing in public for the first time since his ouster. This time round, Morsi is being tried with a  total of 130 others - . including dozens of members of the Brotherhood, the Islamist . Palestinian movement Hamas and Lebanon's Shiite militant group . Hezbollah. The rest of the defendants are being tried in absentia. Prosecutors say Morsi was freed from prison illegally during the . 2011 revolution, with help . from the Palestinian militant group Hamas. They claim some of the defendants helped . thousands to escape during the jailbreak - with others accused of . murdering police officers. The trial comes amid a wave of violent attacks on Egyptian security officials. Fire: Supporters of the Brotherhood and President Mursi close the road during clashes with riot police in Cairo . Protection: A riot policeman sits inside a police vehicle on October Bridge during the clashes with protestors . British . holidaymakers have been told to stay indoors in Cairo after 80 . people died during a weekend of street protests and clashes. Security teams said they were forced to fire live rounds on Brotherhood supporters as they tried to set up . a sit-in in Cairo on Saturday. A . staggering 23 people died in the incident - 22 from bullet wounds - . while five soldiers were also killed when their army helicopter crashed . following a missile attack. Meanwhile, . on Friday, six people died in bombings that the Al-Qaeda-inspired group . Ansar beit al-Maqdis claimed to have carried out. And in the latest in the string of attacks on officials, gunmen on a motorbike shot dead a police general in a west . Cairo neighbourhood today. General Mohamed Saeed was leaving his . home when the criminals opened fire at him - shooting him in the . head and the chest before fleeing, security officials said. Candidate: The Islamist leader's trial also follows the Eyptian military's backing of army chief Field Marshal Abdel Fattah Sisi to run for the presidency. Above, an Egyptian woman holds a poster of al-Sisi . Gen Seed, the head of interior minister Mohamed Ibrahim's 'technical department', later died in hospital. Morsi's appearance in court today is part of a relentless government crackdown on . the ex-president and his Islamist supporters that has seen 1,400 people killed . since he was deposed, according to Amnesty International. Most of those killed have been pro-Morsi demonstrators in street clashes with police and the former president's opponents. Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected president, is already on trial for . inciting the killings of opposition activists during his presidency. He also faces charges of espionage involving Hamas, with that trial due to . open on February 16, and for insulting the judiciary, for which a date . has yet to be set. Although some of these charges carry the death penalty, the . charges against Morsi in the current case carry a life sentence. His trial comes a day after the Eyptian military's backing of . army chief Field Marshal Abdel Fattah al-Sisi for presidency. Wildly . popular for overthrowing Morsi, Sisi is now expected to resign as army . chief and put himself forward as a candidate in the election scheduled . to be held by mid-April.

To . his supporters, Sisi is the best option for ending three years of . instability following the 2011 uprising that ended the presidency of . Hosni Mubarak, another former military officer. On Saturday, . thousands poured into Cairo's Tahrir Square to back Sisi's candidacy, . after he said he required 'public demand' to stand in the election.

Dropped: Ravens cheerleader Courtney Lenz, 23, pictured today, was told that she would not be joining her squad at the Super Bowl because she had a 'rough season' Team player: Courtney Lenz (pictured with squad in 2010 at the end of the row, right) has been cheerleading with the Baltimore Ravens since she was 18 . Miss Lenz told MailOnline today: ' I feel as if it's a slap in the face.' The 23-year-old has been a cheerleader with the Ravens since she was an 18-year-old freshman at Towson college, Baltimore. She . has posed for three team calendars and made dozens of appearances on . behalf of the team since 2008. Last year, she was chosen as one of eight . cheerleaders from 40 to take part in charity work at the Children's . Hospital in Florida where they fund-raised $2million. This season, Miss Lenz, who is 5'4, was dropped from two games in October and November because of weight gain - of 1.6lbs. She was told by Ravens staff to consult a nutritionist and get counseling at her own cost. She . said: 'During the season, I weigh 124lbs. At every practice, the . trainer brings her scale and all the girls are taken aside, weighed and . the number is recorded. 'I was told I was being benched because I had . gained weight and when I asked how much it was, the scales showed 1.6lbs.' Big cheer: Miss Lenz on the field for the Ravens in 2009 when she was still in college . 'Devastated': Miss Lenz has left the cheerleading squad to focus on her marketing career after five years . Miss Lenz said: 'It's agonizing to know that you have gained weight. They really wanted me to lose more weight and be around 120/121lb. I was told: ''I don't care how you do it, just do it.'' 'But I'm not going to do anything to my body and health that affects me in the future.' The college graduate had planned to leave the squad at the end of the season to further her marketing career. The Ravens' qualified for the Super . Bowl after beating the New England Patriots on January 20. Miss Lenz was among the fans . who could not have been more excited, writing on Facebook: 'I'm still in shock!!! I can't believe . I'm headed to New Orleans in two weeks!!!

Not so cheery: Miss Lenz on the field in 2011 (left, in the center).

Orleans. She said: 'When I asked for an explanation, they said I had ''a rough year and faced disciplinary action''. It was devastating.' She then received another email on Sunday night asking her to hand in her Ravens uniform. Miss Lenz said that she had spoken out about being dropped because she felt that what happened to her sent a negative message to young female fans. 'At the end of the day, it [the Ravens] is a business and they are going to tell you what they want you to do. 'I wanted to fight back and say something for other women who are too scared to speak out,' she explained. The 23-year-old said that her mother has been incredibly supportive and that her boyfriend, whom she met at work, has been a 'rock'. She added: 'He was a Redskins fan when we met but I converted him to the Ravens. Now he says I should forget about the Ravens and support the Redskins!' MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the Baltimore Ravens today. Courtney Lenz, 23, of Baltimore, Md., is the only cheerleader with more than three years of experience with the Ravens who will not be making the trip to the Super Bowl . Lenz (left) was a freshman in college when she began cheering for the Ravens. After she finished school, she found a full time marketing job, which is the reason why she has chosen to retire after this season . Thousands of fans have rallied around Lenz, with a Facebook page trying to get the cheer squad to reverse its decision. The petition has gathered more than 1,300 signatures and the Facebook page has been 'liked' by more than 4,770 users. The petition reads: 'Courtney announced she was retiring . during the last home game at the end of the season which didn't go well . with the director [of the cheerleading program]. 'She was told she didn't put in as many appearance hours this season as . she did the past four years while in college. This season she earned her B.S. degree and got a full time job... Bad call. Fans have launched a petition and a Facebook page online to try and get the cheer squad to reverse its decision . 'They also stated she struggled with . weight on occasion and she had been benched for [a] two-pound weight . gain during a game earlier in the fall, which is absurd, unhealthy and a . complete inaccurate measurement of a woman's ""appearance"" and size!' The Ravens denied that her decision to retire had anything to do with their decision not to bring her to the Super Bowl. 'As . set by the NFL, we are permitted to bring 32 cheerleaders to the Super . Bowl,' spokeswoman Heather Harness, said in a statement. 'Our selection process was based upon three criteria: seniority, . performance ability and personal conduct throughout the season. 'As much . as we would like to take the whole team, we are unable to do so, due to . parameters set by the NFL.' 'I'm so angry what they did to her my . heart just isn't into [the Super Bowl game] as much as it was before,' 52-year-old Debbie Kammerer of Pasadena, Md., said .

University of South Florida researchers began excavating the graveyard at the now-closed Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys in September. The dig finished in December. Official records indicated 31 burials at the Marianna site but researchers had estimated there would be about 50 graves. Researchers have now found some of the remains of 55 people in a graveyard at the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida . ArtPart of a coffin found in a grave at the Arthur G.

Erin Kimmerle, a forensic anthropologist leading the university's . investigation. Some . were found under roads or overgrown trees, well away from the white, . metal crosses marking the 31 officially recorded graves. Now, . researchers will try to identify the remains and determine the causes . of death. The bodies were buried sometime between the late 1920s and . early 1950s, researchers said. 'We know very little about those who are buried,' Kimmerle said. A brass plate that read, 'At rest' - likely from a coffin lid - was found close the reform school which was known as a place of abuse . Artifacts from a coffin found in a grave at the Arthur G.

University of South Florida investigators at a research site in a graveyard at the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys. The death count at the mass grave has now risen . They found buttons, a stone marble in a boy's pocket and hardware from coffins. Researchers recovered thousands of nails and a brass plate that read, 'At rest' - likely from a coffin lid. DNA from the remains will be sent to the University of North Texas Center for Human Identification for analysis. Twelve families have contacted researchers in the hopes of identifying relatives that might have been buried at the school, and officials hope dozens of other families will come forward and provide DNA samples to compare with the remains. Ovell Krell of Auburndale is one of . the relatives who already has come forward, hoping to find out what . happened to her brother. George Owen Smith was sent to Dozier when he . was 14 in 1941, and he was found dead a couple of months later. University of South Florida assistant professor of anthropology Dr. Erin Kimmerle exhumes a grave at the Boot Hill cemetery last year at the now closed Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida . His . family never recovered his body, and Krell hopes to claim his remains . and bury them with their parents at a family plot in central Florida. 'We are hoping for closure,' she said. Another . dig is scheduled next month. Nearby residents and former employees and . inmates at the northwest Florida school are helping investigators . determine other potential burial sites, Kimmerle said. Dozier opened in 1900 and closed in 2011 for budgetary reasons. Some . former students from the 1950s and 1960s have accused employees and . guards at the school of physical and sexual abuse, but the Florida . Department of Law Enforcement concluded after an investigation that that . it could not substantiate or dispute the claims. The . University of South Florida secured a permit to exhume the remains . after beginning its own research and verifying more deaths and graves . than documented by law enforcement.

The white building in the background is allegedly where abuse took place . Former inmates at the reform school from the 1950s and 1960s have detailed horrific beatings that took place in a small, white concrete block building at the facility. Ovell Krell speaks about her deceased brother George Owen Smith who was sent to Dozier when he was 14 in 1941 and died a couple of months later. His body was never recovered . A group of survivors call themselves the 'White House Boys' and five years ago called for an investigation into the graves. In 2010, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement ended an investigation and said it could not substantiate or refute claims that boys died at the hands of staff. USF later began its own research and discovered even more graves than the state department had identified. USF has worked for months to secure a permit to exhume the remains, finally receiving permission from Gov. Rick Scott and the state Cabinet after being rejected by Secretary of State Ken Detzner, who reports to Scott. Robert Straley, a spokesman for the White House Boys, said the school segregated white and black inmates and that the remains are located where black inmates were held.

A 15-year-old girl who was fatally struck by a freight train in a suspected suicide posted a farewell message online hours before the incident. 'I love all of y'all. Never forget it!' Megan Whisenhunt, from Fort Worth, Texas wrote on Instagram on Wednesday, along with an image of herself smiling at the camera. Megan was struck by the train near her home at around 9pm on Wednesday night but the remoteness of the location two miles from her home made it tough for medical staff to reach her. She was pronounced dead just after 11pm and 'evidence indicates that [she] was attempting suicide', Police Captain Scott Conn said. Final message: Fifteen-year-old Megan Whisenhunt  posted this image to her Instagram account before she apparently committed suicide on Wednesday, writing: 'I love all of y'all. Never forget it!' Authorities have not given any . suggestion as to what could have driven her to kill herself and social . networking sites suggest she was an outgoing and well-liked student. Afterwards, Megan headed to the tracks where she was hit by the Fort Worth & Western Railroad train, Captain Conn told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Two ambulances arrived at the scene but they had difficulty finding Megan in the dark, Brett Lyle, a MedStar spokeswoman said. When they did find her, she had trauma injuries to her head and torso, according to fire department radio communications, and staff called for an air ambulance and lit the area with flares. Loss: Friends and classmates took to social media to express their sadness over Megan's death . Family: Megan is pictured with her parents, Russ and Kristi, last year. It is unclear if she had any siblings . But on the way to hospital, the helicopter had to make a 'precautionary landing' at Meacham Airport when . a 'status warning light' flashed on the flight deck, officials said. 'The landing was precautionary based on . an status warning light on the flight deck,' said James Swartz, . CareFlite president and CEO. 'It was not an emergency landing, which . means we land immediately rather than continuing to a helipad or . airport.' From there, an ambulance then raced the girl to John Peter Smith Hospital, but she was pronounced dead at 11.05pm. The Tarrant County medical examiner's office identified Megan early on Thursday and ruled that she suffered blunt force trauma to her head and left leg due to train and pedestrian collision. Tragic: Emergency services struggled to find Megan, pictured with her parents, in the dark after she was hit . Scene: She was hit two miles from her family's home and airlifted to hospital - but the helicopter needed to make an early landing because of a fault. She was pronounced dead in hospital on Wednesday night . Megan lived two miles from where she was struck. She was active on social media and gave the impression of a well-liked student with a good sense of humor, although she often spoke negatively of her appearance. Her grandmother, Peggy Ann, wrote on Facebook: 'My precious Megan. My granddaughter who gave up on life and chose not to suffer anymore.

China's ambassador to Britain has invoked Harry Potter villain Lord Voldemort in a diplomatic stand-off between Beijing and Tokyo over the Japanese prime minister's visit to a controversial war shrine. Liu Xiaoming referred to the JK Rowling creation in a newspaper article accusing Japan of stoking tensions in the region and threatening world peace. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said: 'In the Harry Potter story, the dark wizard Voldemort dies because the seven horcruxes, which contain parts of his soul, have been destroyed. 'If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation's soul.' Wizard warfare: Harry Potter villain Lord Voldemort (pictured) has been referred to by China's ambassador to Britain in an article criticising a decision by Japan's prime minister to visit controversial war shrine . Liu's opinion piece comes amid the tensions between China and Japan over Shinzo Abe's visit to the shrine last week. He became the first Japanese head of government since 2006 to pay respects at Yasukuni, which honours Japan's war dead including 14 indicted Class A war criminals. Japanese cabinet minister Yoshitaka Shindo followed up with a visit of his own on Wednesday. Abe said last week that the goal of his shrine visit was 'to pledge and determine that never again will people suffer in war', but the site is seen elsewhere as a reminder of Japan's 20th-century aggression against China and other Asian nations. China said the visit by Shinzo Abe (centre) was 'absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people' Mr Abe's visit to Yasukuni was the first by a serving prime minister since Junichiro Koizumi went there in 2006 . Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said Monday that Abe was 'not welcome' by the Chinese people, and it also provoked vehement condemnation from South Korea and rare criticism by Washington, which has a security alliance with Tokyo. Beijing has been on a diplomatic offensive over the issue, with Foreign Minister Wang Yi making calls to his counterparts in the US, South Korea, Vietnam, Germany and Russia 'to convey his alarm', the state-run China Daily newspaper reported. Liu's op-ed appears to fit into that effort and he reminded Britons that the victims of Japan's wartime horrors included their own countrymen, noting a new film that 'tells the tragic story of a British PoW tortured by the Japanese in the Second World War'. 'China and Britain were wartime allies,' Liu wrote. 'Our troops fought shoulder to shoulder against Japanese aggressors and made enormous sacrifices.' 'Our two countries have a common responsibility to work with the international community to oppose and condemn any words or actions aimed at invalidating the peaceful post-war consensus and challenging international order,' he added. A Chinese man landed himself, literally, in the midst of a territorial dispute between Asia's two great powers after crash-landing a hot air balloon near contested islands held by Japan. The Japanese coastguard said it had rescued the balloonist, identified as 35-year-old-chef Xu Shuaijun, yesterday in the sea near the tiny isles, called the Senkaku by Japan and Diaoyu by China. The man's attempt to land his multi-coloured balloon on the rocky outcrops looks unlikely to have big repercussions for the two countries, however. In hot water: The balloon belonging to a Chinese chef who crash-landed while trying to land on islands at the centre of a dispute between China and Japan . Disputed: Tensions between Japan and China over a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea (pictured) erupted last year when a flotilla of boats carrying Japanese activists was seen in nearby waters . A coastguard spokesman said Japan handed him over to a Chinese patrol vessel on Wednesday evening and Japan's coastguard was operating as normal. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang described the man as a 'balloon enthusiast' and confirmed he had been handed over to a Chinese vessel upon being rescued and was in good health. He declined further comment. Xu's adventure comes amid high tension over the disputed territory between the world's second- and third-biggest economies. Disputed: The location of the islands in the East China Sea . Both sides have been repeatedly scrambling fighter jets against perceived threats, raising fear that a miscalculation could lead to conflict, which in turn could draw in Japan's treaty ally, the United States. On the day Xu, identified as a native of Hebei province, was fished out of the water 22 km (14 miles) south of Uotsuri island, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reiterated his commitment to a stronger military and to revising the pacifist constitution. 'Japan will play an even more proactive role than ever before for world peace and stability,' Abe said in a New Year's message. 'We will fully defend the lives and assets of our nationals as well as our territory, territorial waters and territorial airspace in a resolute manner.'","Liu Xiaoming criticised visit by Japanese PM to controversial war shrine .

Ann Hughes was cleared of 'excessive' behaviour after asking a policeman to speak to pupils about their refusal to smile for a school photograph . A headteacher was yesterday cleared of ‘excessive’ behaviour after asking a policeman to speak to pupils about their refusal to smile for a school photograph. Ann Hughes, head of Ysgol Goronwy Owen, a village primary school at Benllech, Anglesey,  asked PC Brian Jones to speak to the whole class about their behaviour. But the General Teaching Council for Wales said he would have been  well-known to the children as a liaison officer at the village primary. Jacquie Turnbull, chairman of the GTCW’s professional conduct committee, said the policeman was invited to speak to the whole class about their behaviour rather than individual pupils. The chairwoman said: 'We accept pupils became upset when he expressed his disappointment in their behaviour. 'This might have been because they interpreted this as a reprimand. 'This wasn’t a request to reprimand particular pupils,' the chairwoman declared, finding the allegation not proved. She was also cleared of calling a pupil 'twp' - the Welsh term for 'stupid,' criticising his error in spelling his middle name, and ripping up his SATs examination paper in his presence. The panel also found unproved a complaint that Mrs Hughes failed to show proper sensitivity to a boy after the death of his father, favoured Welsh speakers, highlighted parents’ complaints during school assembly, and engaged in excessive criticism of a pupil about his response to her use of the term 'crap.' But Mrs Hugheswas found guilty of “unacceptable professional conduct” because of some other complaints against her. The panel accepted that she failed to ensure there was effective communication within the school including a clear understanding of staff roles and responsibilities in her absence, and that Mrs Hughes failed to maintain a cooperative working relationship among staff. The school had been engulfed in crisis in May 2011 when five of the six teachers called in sick on the same day after earlier threatening industrial action following a declaration of no confidence in Mrs Hughes. They claimed there was a 'climate of fear.' Ysgol Goronwy Owen, a village primary school at Benllech, Anglesey, where Mrs Hughes was head.

Mrs Hughes’s barrister Annette Gumbs urged that there should be no disciplinary order. She said: 'The exceptional circumstances here are the very fact of the very difficult circumstances that existed in the face of five teachers who had set their face against her.' Counsel said: 'She is passionate about children and the care of children and their education.' Miss Gumbs remarked: 'She was faced with a campaign for her dismissal. Despite difficult times she was able to maintain the standards in the school.' She had sought support from the education authority and chairman of governors.

Accused rapist: Married father of four Bryon Johnston has been named the primary suspect in the abduction and sexual assault of two women . A discarded Starbucks cup led police to a married father of four as the primary suspect in the sexual assaults of two women abducted from Olympia, Washington bus stops. Bryon Johnston, 35, was arrested Tuesday after the cup fell out of the his car and into a parking lot February 19 as a woman he tried to abduct fled, police said. The cup had a sticker with coffee information that revealed it had been bought earlier that day at a Starbucks drive-through in DuPont. Police were able to match surveillance video, leading them to Johnston, cops said. Johnston is accused in the November 28 abduction and rape of a woman from a downtown bus stop, and the attempted rape of a woman he kidnapped and sexually assaulted last month, sources told The Olympian. The woman who escaped her would-be rapist's vehicle gave a chilling account to the paper. He first picked her up from a bus stop and drove her to a local motor lodge where he asked if she 'wanted to make some money' before groping her breasts and threatening to cut her. He also pulled her hair as she fought him off while bailing out of the moving vehicle, several items fell out of the truck as he sped off, including the coffee cup. The woman brought the items to the attention of police who soon arrived on the scene, and the information on the cup's sticker - which includes drink, location and exact time down to the second - made it easy for police to track down Johnston.

A San Francisco firefighter has filed a legal claim alleging fire officials falsely identified her to the media as the person responsible for killing a 16-year-old survivor of the Asiana Airlines crash, a newspaper reported. Fire officials wanted to protect the firefighter who first ran over Ye Meng Yuan and was responsible for her death, according to Elyse Duckett's claim. Footage shows Duckett's rig was the second to roll over Meng Yuan, who was covered in fire foam at the time, the newspaper reported. Elyse Duckett: The firefighter is alleging defamation in the Asiana crash as being falsely identified as the one who ran over a Chinese teenage girl that died in the accident . Pinning the blame: Duckett¿s claim says Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White and other department brass told her 'that she needed to admit to the incident and take responsibility' for Ye¿s death . A dashboard camera aboard a San Francisco Fire Department rig shows crash victim Ye Meng Yuan, in the foreground and partially obscured by foam. The rig ran over Miss Yuan seconds later . The girl was one of three Chinese teens who died in the July 6 crash; . one died during the crash, and another died later in the hospital. Video from a camera mounted on a San . Francisco firetruck shows at least two emergency workers alerting . vehicles to go around Chinese student Ye Meng Yuan as she lay on the . ground by the stricken aircraft. The first responders believed she was . dead and did not check her vital signs. One . lieutenant told crash investigators that she made 'a three second' visual assessment of Miss Yuan and automatically assumed 'that's our . first casualty' - without putting a finger to her pulse or checking if . she was still breathing. Less . than 15 minutes after the first driver had seen Miss Yuan, they drove . over the teen who was now covered in the foam being used to douse the . burning plane. Moments later, a second fire truck rode over the . student's body. Highlighted: A camera aboard 'Rescue Truck 10' shows a firefighter directing the truck around Ye on the ground - 15 minutes later he would run her over . Miss Yuan's body lies covered in foam as firefighters battle to put out the flames from the crashed Asiana Airlines plane on July 6 last year . The video . does not show the trucks running her over but the original footage is . in the possession of the distraught teenage girl's family and legal team . in China. The official . line from the San Francisco Fire Department is that the girl was . accidentally struck by trucks racing to battle the fiery wreck of the . Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 because she was hidden by foam sprayed over . the plane. Duckett is accusing the department of discrimination and defamation and seeking $300,000 in damages. Such claims are generally precursors to lawsuits. City and fire officials didn't immediately respond to messages left early Tuesday by The Associated Press. They . declined comment to the Chronicle, although fire spokeswoman Mindy .

The smaller bird had spent 10 minutes patiently diving for trout in the waters off Long Beach in California and had only just caught one when the pelican crashed into the water to grab the fish. Although the brave cormorant put up a short struggle, it was no match for a bird more than five times its size, so eventually gave up its prized catch and was forced to swim away hungry. Thief: The tiny cormorant had only just caught a trout after 10 minutes of patient diving when the pelican crashed into the water to grab the fish . Battle: Although the brave cormorant put up a short struggle, it was no match for the massive pelican . Photographer Andrew Lee, 52, watched as the helpless cormorant resigned itself to defeat. Mr Lee, who named his series of photographs 'The Silver Bandit', said: 'I was there mainly to capture the ospreys diving for fish. 'These magnificent raptors usually compete with the cormorants, pelicans, and occasionally, the great blue herons for the same fish.' 'I followed this particular cormorant for about ten minutes. The bird made several dives without success.' Mr Lee said after numerous dives, the cormorant eventually surfaced with a large trout still thrashing in its long beak. Incoming: Mr Lee described the struggle between the birds as 'very noisy and aggressive' Defeated: The cormorant eventually gave up its prized catch and was forced to swim away hungry . For the next few minutes the hungry bird struggled as it desperately tried to swallow its catch. 'The bird tried hard to position the fish for swallowing head first,' Mr Lee said. 'Nearby, . a big white pelican saw all the commotion and, capitalising on the . opportunity of an easy meal, flew over and tried to steal the catch,' he added. In the ensuing struggle, which Mr Lee described as 'very noisy and aggressive' the pelican successfully stole the trout from the cormorant. Mr Lee said cormorants are particularly skillful hunters because their beaks have a hook on the end which allows them to hold onto even the slipperiest of fish. Over quickly: The fish fight lasted roughly 10 seconds, the photographer said. He added that he later saw the two birds drying themselves on the same pontoon acting 'like good neighours' once again . 'This cormorant would most likely find . and catch another fish to eat. And cormorants, given the opportunity, . will also try to steal fish from the smaller osprey,' he added. Mr Lee said the fight lasted about 10 seconds before the white pelican stole and swallowed the cormorant's catch. The cormorant, he said, then swam away 'very calmly'. 'Although the pelican stole the fish from the hard-working cormorant, there seemed to be no animosity between them,' he said. 'Later on, I saw both of them sharing the same spots on the pontoon, resting and drying themselves, like good neighbours... Maybe we could learn something about living in harmony,' he added.","Small cormorant spent around 10 minutes patiently diving to catch trout .

A Southwest Airlines flight from Seattle to Sacramento, Calif., was forced to make an emergency landing in Oregon after a passenger terrorized the flight crew and passengers by repeatedly displaying gang signs, praising Jesus and demanding alcohol. Sheron Lamar Rogers, 26, was taken into custody on Tuesday at Portland International Airport and currently remains in jail pending a detention hearing. Rogers told FBI special agent Jake Green afterwards that he didn't believe he had threatened anyone, and any gang signs he had displayed ‘were for Jesus.’ Sheron Lamar Rogers, 26, caused a Southwest Airlines flight from Seattle to Sacramento on Tuesday to make an emergency landing in Oregon after he terrorized the flight crew and passengers . The trouble started as soon as Rogers boarded the Tuesday morning flight and claimed he had a first-class ticket - something which Southwest doesn’t do . According to a criminal complaint filed in U.S District court in Portland, Rogers was asked three times to stow his luggage. ‘I do what I want,’ he replied, the documents show. Next he started pressing the call button and so a flight attendant asked if he had an emergency. ‘Yea... I need a (expletive) drink!' he replied. A woman nearby asked that she and her daughter be moved to different seats, the documents state.

As the plane taxied then took off, the man repeatedly hit the call button, swore and demanded alcohol. The problems got worse when the plane hit cruising altitude, reports The Oregonian. Rogers started shouting at flight attendants that he had an emergency, telling one he wanted three glasses of wine, the records show. When the attendant said he could only have one glass at a time, the man's behavior became more erratic. 'Get the f*** out of my face,' he screamed. Then he said, 'Jesus loves you,' according to documents. Rogers then started to swear at passengers, flash gang signs and demand to speak with the pilot, the documents say. Rogers admitted that he had smoked a strain of cannabis that he called 'purple hash' before he boarded the flight which may have caused him to act erratic . A flight attendant became so frightened that she asked another passenger to help her restrain Rogers if he became violent, according to court records. Another attendant boiled a pot of water to use against the suspect if he tried to approach the flight deck, the records show. The pilot then took to decision to divert the flight and land to ensure the safety of all onboard, the documents say. Two Port of Portland police met the plane at the gate and took Rogers into custody, while he continued to talk incessantly about Jesus, the documents say. He told investigators he smoked ‘purple hash’ before the flight but didn't feel high. Rogers may have been referring to Purple Haze, a strain of cannabis known for its purple color and high potency. Rogers claimed any gang signs he 'threw up were for Jesus' and that the woman who switched seats did so because he is black, according to the documents.

Scroll down for video . Rachel Canning, 22, attends the University of South Florida and apart from her name doesn't share a lot in common with the 18-year-old New Jersey high school student who has hit the headlines this week for suing her parents . A family court judge denied a request by Canning of Lincoln Park, New Jersey, to have her parents temporarily resume paying her tuition and living expenses. He set another hearing date for next month . On her way to a sorority chapter meeting on Monday evening, USF Rachel was surprised to find that she had 200 pending ‘follow’ requests for an account that she had previously only used last year when she was running for homecoming queen. Very quickly her Facebook was filled with abusive messages from people she didn’t know and who were mistaking her for someone else. ‘At first, I thought, “What the heck?”’ Canning told the Tampa Bay Times. ‘I was more disturbed at the online bullying going on. Regardless, this girl's only 18. I couldn't believe there were full-grown adults that spent their day not only stalking this girl but sending bullying messages... I've never been on the receiving end of anything like that.’ The message that USF Canning posted to explain that she wasn't the infamous Rachel Canning of New Jersey was seen by more than 10,000 users . SFU Rachel Canning, right, has posted a link to her charity walk on Facebook after she received a load of internet trolls who thought she was the New Jersey high school student who is suing her parents, left . Some commenter used profanity, while others told her how terrible she was and that they wished she would get hit by a bus. Canning, who was named USF homecoming queen in October, said her campaign Facebook page had previously got about three views a day. By comparison, a message she posted to explain that she wasn’t the infamous Rachel Canning of New Jersey was seen by more than 10,000 users. But rather than take all that negativity to heart, Canning has decided to put the spike in traffic to her Facebook page to a good cause. In April Canning is set to participate in a fundraising walk for the advocacy group Autism Speaks and so she has posted a link to her fundraising page. Her 19-year-old brother, Thomas, has Asperger's syndrome. 'For Rachel to turn negative attention into something so positive shows what a great person and big sister she is,' said Katy Formella, Tampa Bay manager for Autism Speaks. Boring? Rachel Canning appears to yawn while listening to how her family were torn apart by her claims and behavior . Sensational claims: Rachel Canning attends Morris County Court today in her school uniform. She is suing her parents Sean and Elizabeth for 'abandoning' her after she ran away after her 18th birthday . The New Jersey Rachel Canning came to . the world's attention earlier this week when it was revealed that she . was suing her parents to support her after she moved out of their home. Her . initial request was denied on Tuesday by a judge who cautioned that the . case could lead to a 'potentially slippery slope' of claims by . teenagers against their parents. Canning . had sought immediate relief in the form of $650 in weekly child support . and the payment of the remainder of her tuition at Morris Catholic High . School, as well as attorney's fees. State . Superior Court Judge Peter Bogaard denied those motions but ordered the . parties to return to court on April 22, when they will present evidence . and testimony on the over-arching question of whether the Cannings are . obligated to financially support their daughter. A . high school senior, Canning has already been accepted by at least one . college and is seeking to have her parents pay some or all of her . tuition, attorney Tanya Helfand told Bogaard on Tuesday. Dressed . in her school uniform and with several friends in the gallery, Rachel . Canning didn't speak to reporters after the hearing. Bogaard . sounded skeptical of some of the claims in the lawsuit, saying it could . lead to teens 'thumbing their noses' at their parents, leaving home and . then asking for financial support. Blasted: The judge hearing the case took a very dim view of a voicemail . Rachel left for . her mother. She told her 'I hate you' and 'I wanna s*** all over your . face' Heartbreak: . Elizabeth and Sean Canning broke down in tears as details of how their . family was torn apart were read out publicly in Morris County Court, New . Jersey . 'Are . we going to open the gates for 12-year-olds to sue for an Xbox? For . 13-year-olds to sue for an iPhone?' he asked. 'We should be mindful of a . potentially slippery slope.' Court documents show frequent causes of parent-teenage tension - boyfriends and alcohol - taken to an extreme. In . the filings, there are accusations and denials, but one thing is clear: . the girl left home Oct. 30, two days before she turned 18 after a . tumultuous stretch during which her parents separated and reconciled and . the teen began getting into uncharacteristic trouble at school. In . court filings, Canning's parents, retired Lincoln Park police Chief . Sean Canning and his wife, Elizabeth, said their daughter voluntarily . left home because she didn't want to abide by reasonable household . rules, such as being respectful, keeping a curfew, doing a few chores . and ending a relationship with a boyfriend her parents say is a bad . influence. They say that shortly before she turned 18, she told her parents that she would be an adult and could do whatever she wanted. She . said her parents are abusive, contributed to an eating disorder she . developed and pushed her to get a basketball scholarship. Phone message left for Liz Canning from Rachel at July 2, 2013 1:18pm, submitted to Morris County Court, which got the judge apparently so angry: . 'Hi . mom just to let you know you're a real f**king winner aren't you you . think you're so cool and you think you caught me throwing up in the . bathroom after eating an egg frittatta, yeah sorry that you have . problems now and you need to harp on mine because i didn't and i . actually took a s*** which i really just wanna s*** all over your face . right now because it looks like that anyway, anyway i f***ing hate you . and um I've written you off so don't talk to me, don't do anything I'm . blocking you from just about everything, have a nice life, bye mom' Dim view: The judge denied her request for any immediate financial costs to be paid and warned Rachel that her request would probably be turned down on the evidence she has provided so far . Pained: Rachel's parents owe more than $5,000 on her school fees, but are refusing to pay, saying that she had 'emancipated' herself from their care . They . say they were supportive, helped her through the eating disorder and . paid for her to go to a private school where she would not get as much . playing time in basketball as she would have at a public school. Helfand . told Bogaard in court on Tuesday that Rachel Canning learned her . behavior from her parents, particularly her mother, with whom she has a . difficult relationship. 'These . people who call themselves loving parents paint the most disgusting . portrait of their daughter' in the court filings, she said. 'They are . pointing the finger to avoid their parental responsibilities.' A . cheerleader and lacrosse player who hopes to become a biomedical . engineer, Canning wants the judge to declare that she's non-emancipated . and dependent as a student on her parents for support . Attorney . Laurie Rush-Masuret, representing the Canning parents, called Rachel .

"By . Lizzie Parry . PUBLISHED: . 09:14 EST, 7 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 10:49 EST, 7 March 2014 . In her heyday she was the world's most graceful and stylish ocean liner, boasting four U.S. presidents and glamorous Hollywood stars on her passenger roll. She sailed the Atlantic in record time, offering her passengers a trip in the lap of luxury. But by the late 1960s, the SS United States - dubbed America's Flagship - was resigned to retirement, and consigned to a pier on the Delaware River in Philidelphia. Heyday: Dubbed America's flagship the SS United States, was the most luxurious and opulent ocean liner of its time. It still holds the record for fastest trans-Atlantic crossing despite having been retired from the high seas 17 years ago . Campaign: A not-for-profit group, backed by best-selling author David Macaulay, have launched a campaign to restore the passenger liner to its former glory. The ship has been docked on the Delaware River in Philadelphia and left to rust since she retired in 1969 . Four former U.S. presidents feature on the passenger log of America's Flagship, the SS United States - Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy and Bill all sailed aboard the ocean liner. Famous passengers includes Marlon Brando, Coco Chanel, Sean Connery, Walt Disney, Judy Garland, Cary Grant, Charles Heston, Marilyn Monroe, Grace Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor, John Wayne and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, sailed on the ship. Another famous passenger, of sorts, was the Mona Lisa, Leonardo's masterpiece, which in 1963, travelled to the U.S. for special exhibitions in Washington and New York. With the rise in the popularity of flying, prices fell and gone was the decadent era of glitz and glamour on the high seas. But today a new campaign has been launched by U.S. best-selling author and illustrator David Macaulay, to save the once-majestic ocean liner left to rust for the last 17 years. 'It's a unique object, a symbol of time in American history that we've sort of long since passed,' Macaulay said. 'It's important to keep it intact visually.' The author, who crossed the Altantic on board the impressive liner with his family to start a new life in American in 1957, said he is keen to 'draw attention to it' in anyway he can. He is working on a new book, which will trace the evolution of passenger ships through to the building of the SS United States, as well as describe his experience as a boy sailing on the ship to his new home on a new continent. The steam-powered ship, which measures almost 1,000ft, with its giant twin chimneys painted red, white and blue, was launched in 1952. It still holds the record for the fastest trans-Atlantic voyage by a passenger ship and is the largest ocean liner to be built in the U.S. She is 10ft longer than the Titanic and nearly 10,000 tons heavier, it carried one million passengers, before the ship was retired in 1969. Hollywood glamour: Actress and Hollywood darling Marilyn Monroe was among a prestigious list of famous passengers that sailed the seas aboard the SS United States . Presidential: The ship boasts former U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and John F. Kennedy on the passenger log . Impressive: Former presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Harry Truman also sailed aboard the impressive liner . In 2010 the not-for-profit organisation SS United States Conservancy bought the retired liner for $5.8million, donated by Philadelphia philanthropist H.F. 'Gerry' Lenfest. The money also covered maintenance and preservation costs. The group hopes to raise enough money to restore the ship's exterior and convert the interior, which covers around 500,000 square feet. The vision is to create space inside for restaurants, shops, as well as a museum and education centre. Susan Gibbs, the granddaughter of the ship's designer William Francis Gibbs, and director of the conservancy group, said they are hoping to find a permanent berth for the renovated vessel on the country's east coast. She said New York is currently the leading candidate and added that the refurbishment of the ship's exterior alone, is expected to cost a staggering $40million to $60million. Macaulay added: 'It's battered. It's beaten, but it's all paint so it's superficial.' The SS United States is 990 feet long. If the ship stood on her end, she would rise nearly as high as New York's Chrysler Building.It was more than 100 feet longer than the Titanic. Designer William Francis Gibbs wanted the ship to be fireproof, so insisted no wood was used in her construction. The only exception was the ship's grand pianos, which were made from a fire-resistant mahogany. Fastest passenger liner: The SS United States still retains the title fastest passenger liner after crossing the Atlantic in record time on its maiden voyage in 1952 . More aluminium was used building the SS United States than any other ship previously. The idea was to reduce the ship's weight and make her the fastest ocean liner. The ship was designed to be just wide enough (101 feet) to pass through the locks of the Panama Canal. The design was so innovative at the time that details of the construction were kept top-secret. It was the first passenger liner to be built almost entirley in a dry dock, out of the view of the public. Five days before her maiden voyage in July 1952, the SS United States was opened to the public at her berth in New york. A crowd of 70,000 turned out to see the new ship. Restoration: The SS United States Conservancy Group, led by Susan Gibbs, granddaughter of William Francis Gibbs - the ship's designer - said restoring the exterior alone is expected to cost up to $60million . The ship reached speeds of 44 miles per hour, during testing. She could reverse almost as fast as the Titanic could go forwards. On her maiden voyage she was the first American ship in 100 years to capture the coveted Blue Riband - which is awarded to the fastest trans-Atlantic ocean liners. She still holds the record, 60 years later. The SS United States was built to be converted in war time. It could carry 15,000 troops, 10,000 miles without the need to refuel. For her maiden voyage the ship's catering team stocked 7,935 quarts of ice cream and 500lbs of caviar. The ship's galley could make 9,000 meals every day. The ship was retired from service in 1969. She has spent her retirement docked on the Delaware River in Philidelphia. She has been there for 17 years.","Branded America's Flagship the liner completed her maiden voyage in 1952 .

Two high-class escorts who made hundreds of thousands of dollars a year had so much cash that they stashed it under carpets, in air vents and at storage units, investigators have said. Jennifer Helen Richmond, 22, has been arrested for racketeering for . her alleged part in a prostitution ring in Orlando, Florida that she said earned her $500,000 one year.

Davis and their suspected boss, Abdullah Hamid, have fled the area and have not been arrested. The trio have been on the Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation's radar for years, and now Richmond's arrest has revealed their life of cash, fast cars and luxury hotels, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Throughout their years-long investigation, the MBI identified 15 to 20 women who worked for Hamid over the past five to . eight years at agencies including 'Platinum Companions' and 'Ashley's . Playmates'. The agency charged $300 to . $400 for one hour, while a dinner date for up to five hours ranged from $1,500 to $1,800.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 18:54 EST, 6 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 21:48 EST, 6 March 2014 . Massachusetts lawmakers approved legislation Thursday to crack down on those who secretly take photographs of 'the sexual or other intimate parts' of women or children in public. Approval of the bill, which also would apply to male victims, came a day after the state's highest court ruled that a man who took cellphone photos up the skirts of female passengers riding the Boston subway didn't violate state law. Top lawmakers said the bill will send a clear message to those who take so-called 'upskirt' photos. New legislature: The legislation was pushed through when the high court ruled that a man who took pictures up women's skirts on public transport had not broken the law . 'It is sexual harassment. It's an assault on another person whether it's a child or an adult,' Senate President Therese Murray said moments after the Senate unanimously approved the bill. 'Woman and children should be able to go to public places without feeling that they are not protected by the law.' The legislation says anyone who 'photographs, videotapes or electronically surveils' another person's sexual or intimate parts without that person's consent would face a misdemeanor charge and a maximum penalty of two-and-a-half years in jail and a $5,000 fine. Upskirt: Michael Robertson took photographs up women's skirts on public transport without their knowledge . The crime becomes a felony with a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine for photographs or recordings of a child under 18. Distributing such photos would carry a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Murray said those who take such photos sometimes post them on pornographic websites. House Speaker Robert DeLeo said the Legislature moved swiftly after the Supreme Judicial Court issued its ruling Wednesday. 'Not only did we get it done quickly, but I think there was a feeling that we did it right,' he said. 'We wanted to make sure that this would be a law that would pass all legal questions that could arise.' After additional procedural votes, the bill could reach Governor Deval Patrick later Thursday or Friday. Patrick said he would sign the legislation. DeLeo and Murray both expressed frustration with the court ruling, but said lawmakers are facing an ongoing challenge keeping up with rapidly changing technology. 'What we didn't talk about yet are drones,' Murray said. 'So now the drone issue will come up in the future also about privacy issues.' Wednesday's court decision overruled a lower court that had upheld charges against Michael Robertson, who was arrested in August 2010 by transit police who set up a sting after getting reports that he was using his cellphone to take photos and video up the skirts and dresses of female riders. The state's existing Peeping Tom law 'does not apply to photographing (or videotaping or electronically surveilling) persons who are fully clothed and, in particular, does not reach the type of upskirting that the defendant is charged with,' the court said. The SJC said that while such actions should be illegal, they are not, given the way state law is written. In the past three years, MBTA police have investigated 13 'secretly photographing' cases. In some cases, the alleged offender was issued a court summons. Some remain open investigations. During those three years there was an average of 395 million passenger trips on the MBTA.","Massachusetts lawmakers approved a bill that criminalizes secretly taking photographs up women's skirts .

A congressman caught with cocaine in an undercover police sting refused to resign his Florida seat after leaving rehab. Republican Trey Radel said he wants to 'rebuild the trust' of voters during a news conference held the same day he left a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center. The 37-year-old freshman told reporters at his Cape Coral office that he will cooperate with congressional investigators who are looking into his conduct. Scroll down for video . Vow: Congressman Trey Radel tells the press he wants to rebuild trust after his enforced stint in rehab following his conviction for cocaine possession . 'I love what I do and I’m going to return to what I do, what you sent me to do in Washington D.C., which is working for you and your family while I relish mine,' Radel told voters watching on live television in his district. 'No one — no one will take away my passion when it comes to serving southwest Florida.' On November 20, Radel pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of cocaine possession and was sentenced to a year of probation. He admitted to purchasing 3.5 grams of cocaine from an undercover officer in Washington on Oct. 29. He entered rehab on November 21. Resistance: Congressman Trey Radel, with his wife Amy at his side, told the press he was not going to bow to pressure and resign . Standing with his wife at the evening . news conference, Radel pledged to redouble his congressional efforts . 'with a clearer focus and a stronger mind' and regain the trust of his . constituents. While he . declined to say whether he would run for re-election, he gave what . amounted to a campaign speech, vigorously defending his legislative . record and repeatedly addressing TV viewers. Radel, a former local news anchor, timed his announcement for the 6 p.m. newscasts. 'My . situation isn’t the end, and it’s not the whole story,' he said, . ticking off a list of priorities, including reducing the deficit and . protecting Social Security and Medicare. The House Ethics Committee announced Monday that it was launching a formal investigation of the congressman. Several . GOP leaders, including Gov. Rick Scott, had asked him to resign. On . Thursday, some of those same officials reiterated their calls for Radel . to step down. Standing by her man: Amy Radel answers a question involving her husband, Congressman Trey Radel at his Cape Coral office on Thursday . In a statement, Scott said, 'I’m glad that Trey has sought help, and it’s my hope he continues to put his attention on rehabilitation and his family.' Former Rep. Connie Mack IV, who . represented the area for eight years before a failed run for Senate last . year, has been mentioned as a possible primary challenger. Radel . said his drug and alcohol abuse never interfered with his official . duties. 'This was my personal issue on personal time,' he said. While . court documents said the lawmaker purchased cocaine on several . occasions prior to his bust in October, he maintained Thursday that he . had only used the drug 'a handful of times' beginning in college. His . treatment, he said, was focused on alcoholism. Radel's wife Amy is 'my rock,' he said, and his two-year-old son Henry is 'my little guy' -- but Mrs. Radel was nowhere to be seen during the press conference . Asked about his support for drug testing food-stamp recipients, Radel said members of Congress 'can and should be tested as well.' 'Maybe it will help someone else in the future.' Radel had been in office for 10 months when he was charged. His district includes the Gulf Coast cities of Fort Myers and Naples. The drug arrest derailed a seemingly promising career. After a stint as a TV news anchor, he started a media-relations firm and hosted an early-morning conservative talk-radio show in southwest Florida. He married another news anchor and they had a baby. On Thursday, his wife, Amy, called him a 'great man' and said she supported his return to public life. Vacancy? Trey Radel's office door was closed all day Wednesday, and his staff wasn't talking to the media . When he decided to run for Congress, he became involved in a bruising, six-way GOP primary, openly targeting opponents on the Internet and facing criticism for his firm’s ownership of explicitly named websites. But he was backed by the local tea party movement and Republican luminaries, including Mack and Sen. Marco Rubio, and clinched the GOP nomination. He cruised to victory in November. Things were seemingly going well for Radel. His wife was featured in a glowing local news segment about how the couple were adjusting to life in D.C., he had sponsored a handful of bills, and he was interviewed by several inside-the-Beltway publications. He was active on Twitter and wrote pieces for Buzzfeed about rap music. (He dubbed Public Enemy’s 'Fight the Power' a conservative anthem 'because I believe when government expands it becomes a political tool meant to oppress.') He championed cuts in sheep-farm subsidies, keeping good on his conservative promise. Then, on Oct. 29, Radel attempted to buy $250 worth of cocaine from an undercover police officer in a Washington, D.C., neighborhood. According to court documents, federal agents confronted the congressman and he invited them to his apartment, where he turned over a vial of the drug. A DEA official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release details of the case in his own name said Radel was identified to authorities as a cocaine buyer by his suspected dealer. For the next three weeks, Radel didn’t skip a beat. He held a re-election fundraiser at a Naples country club, continued to cast votes and bashed 'Obamacare' on Twitter. He did not tell House leaders about the bust until Nov. 19, when reporters broke the news about the case. When his arrest became public, Radel said during a news conference that he had struggled with drug and alcohol abuse 'off and on for years.' On Thursday, he said he would continue to build a support system 'for the rest of my life,' including attending daily meetings and 'reconnecting with my spiritual side.' His first task, he said: setting up the family Christmas tree.","Florida congressman Trey Radel pleaded guilty to cocaine possession .

Rutgers' professor James Livingston has been ordered to pay $112,000 towards his daughter's law school tuition despite the fact they no longer speak . A father has been ordered to pay half of his daughter's $225,000 law school tuition despite the fact she cut contact with him five years, it has been revealed. Rutgers University history professor James C. Livingston was told to pay $112,500 so that his daughter, identified only as 'J', can attend Cornell Law School. The law school tuition is only a few thousand dollars short of Mr Livingston's annual college salary of $123,500. Mr Livingston divorced from his wife Patricia Rossi in 2009 after 26 years of marriage. The couple, who used to live in Highland Park, New Jersey, agreed to split the cost if their daughter attended law school and maintained a C average grade. Following the divorce, Mr Livingston claims that his daughter no longer wanted to speak to him. The college professor told MailOnline today that it was not true that he had fallen out with his daughter as was initially reported and that she had cut contact with him in 2009. In an email, Mr Livingston wrote: 'She stopped communicating with me in 2009, but I assumed that once the high feelings understandably caused by the divorce had subsided, we would reconstruct our relationship. 'Our five-year estrangement is not a product of mutual agreement, in sum.  It still feels inexplicable.  It's her decision, not mine.' Miss Livingston, 26, graduated from Rutgers University shortly before her parents divorce and did not enroll in law school until three years later. Professor Livingston claimed in the lawsuit that his daughter had previously agreed to start law school within a year or two of undergrad but instead took time off and got a job. Despite communications between the father and daughter having broken down, Professor Livingston said he would pay $7,500 a year for his daughter to attend Rutger's law and live at home. She decided to go to the Ivy League school Cornell in Ithaca, New York. A two-judge appellate panel told Mr Livingston last month that a lower court's decision would be upheld. The judges voted in favor of the professor's daughter saying that the divorce papers did not allow the father to dictate what school she could go to. Professor Livingston was ordered by an appellate court on Wednesday to pay half of his daughter's quarter of a million dollar tuition to Cornell Law School . Professor Livingston also argued that he was not obligated to pay if his daughter was estranged. Ms Rossi's lawyer Daniel Brown told NJ.com: 'You could read the tea leaves. The . parties negotiated the settlement as to what their respective . obligations would be. The parties can agree to support the child and . that's exactly what occurred here.' Mr Livingston's lawyer Edward Snyder was not available for comment when contacted by MailOnline today. There was no indication that the college professor would appeal the verdict.","Rutgers University history professor .

The New York Post's Page Six is suggesting NBC’s 61-year-old prime-time Olympic host may have inadvertently caught the nasty eye virus whilst having Botox injections. At one point, Costas' had to take six days off to recover, to be replaced by Meredith Viera because his viral conjunctivitis had become so bad and spread to both eyes.

Sore: Costas said he woke up to find his eye was swollen and joked that it was as red . 'as the Soviet flag' Also known as Conjunctivitis, pinkeye is an infection of the mucus membrane that lines the eyelid - causing the eyes to become red and inflamed. Pinkeye is most commonly contracted from a virus which can spread through person to person contact or contaminated water. Doctors suggest thorough hand-washing as the best way to prevent getting the infection. Conjunctivitis can also be caused by bacteria, lack of tears, chemicals or allergies. It is not a serious infection and usually clears up within 7 to 10 days. While bacterial pinkeye can be treated with antibiotic eye drops, ointment or pills - viral pinkeye usually doesn't have a specific treatment. However eagle-eyed viewers noted how smooth Costas' forehead was during the high definition coverage of the Sochi games. A spokesperson from NBC Sports insisted to the New York Post: 'This has zero truth to this. Zero.'

The proportion of Britons with dementia has unexpectedly fallen by about a quarter in the last twenty years . Britons are less likely to develop dementia today than two decades ago, researchers claim. A major study found the chances of developing the disease in old age has fallen by a quarter since the 1990s. However, the overall number of dementia sufferers is on the rise because more of us live to an age when the illness is most prevalent. It is not yet clear why the dementia risk has dropped but the Cambridge University researchers think it may be partly due to better treatment for heart disease – including improved uptake of drugs for high blood pressure – which could protect against dementia. It could also be down to improvements in education over the last century. Children who stay at school for longer are less likely to get dementia later in life. But the researchers warned that dementia – including Alzheimer’s disease – remains a huge burden on the NHS and society, which will only increase in the coming years. The study also found that the percentage of care home residents with dementia had increased from 56 per cent to 70 per cent, with fewer residents in better health. This places a considerable burden on staff and means patients may be at risk receiving of poor care.The researchers said the development could be because the elderly and frail are more likely to receive support at home from carers, using residential homes only as a last resort when they are too ill to care for themselves. The study, published in the Lancet, followed 8,000 randomly selected over-65s between 2008 and 2011, recording how many participants had dementia. They compared the findings with the results of another group of 7,000 adults who had been followed between 1989 and 1994. The proportion diagnosed with dementia dropped from 8.3 per cent to 6.5 per cent over the 20-year period, a fall of 24 per cent. A study of almost 15,000 people revealed that within the general population there are now 200,000 fewer cases than predicted two decades ago. Image shows a CT scan of a brain with Alzheimer's disease . Professor Anthony Arthur, of the University of East Anglia said: ‘What we are not . saying is that the numbers of adults with dementia is falling. But individually someone aged 65 has a lower risk than they did 20 years ago. ‘Obviously as the population ages there will be more people in the 65-and-over category. ‘We think that risk factors associated with heart disease have declined dramatically.’ Researchers think that one cause may . be the increasing use of drugs for high blood pressure such as beta . blockers, which are thought to have a protective effect because they . help maintain a steady flow of blood to the brain. Another cause may be a fall in the numbers of smokers. Tobacco is known to increase the risk of getting the disease. Dementia prevalence is higher amongst women than men over 65 with 7.7 per cent thought to have dementia, compared to 4.9 per cent of men . An Alzheimer’s Society spokesman . said: ‘This interesting study could indicate that better heart health . and education are combining to play a role in reducing dementia . prevalence. ‘While this is good news, this is one study which needs careful examination and may not indicate a continuing trend. ‘Dementia remains the biggest health and social care challenge facing the UK.’ Dr Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of . the Lancet said, ‘A reduction in prevalence of dementia in the older . population is an important and welcome finding. ‘But it is not a signal for government to deprioritise investment in dementia care and research. ‘Dementia remains a substantial challenge for those affected, their families, the NHS, and the Treasury.’","There are now 200,000 fewer dementia cases than predicted 20 years ago .

On Wednesday, he relented, after his angry wife stepped in, 'fed up' with all the negative media attention . She said the controversial paraphernalia will be replaced with an American flag. While her husband refuses to say sorry for the offense he caused, Mrs Curley told WPTV News: 'I'll apologise, will that make you feel better? 'I apologise for my husband putting that up.' Mr Hayes, who on his business card describes himself as a recruiter for the KKK, erected the display outside the couple's home several weeks ago. Neighbours said they thought Mr Hayes was trying to recruit young people in the community to the racist group.

Professor Sir Brian Jarman, a senior Government health adviser, claims more than 20,000 lives could have been saved if ministers and the NHS had paid attention to alerts about higher than average mortality rates . Labour was warned of alarmingly high death rates in 25 NHS hospitals and told inspections by health watchdogs appeared ‘fundamentally flawed’, a leaked email reveals today. Professor Sir Brian Jarman, a senior Government health adviser, claims more than 20,000 lives could have been saved if ministers and the NHS had paid attention to alerts about higher than average mortality rates. In an email sent in 2010, seen by the Daily Mail, he gave the then Health Secretary Andy Burnham a list of hospitals where he warned there were alarming numbers of patient deaths. Several of those hospitals have now been the subject of a Government review into their high mortality ratios, due to be unveiled to MPs today. NHS medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh is set to detail failings at 14 trusts in England thought to have been responsible for up to 13,000 excess deaths going back years. He is expected to describe poor care, medical errors and management blunders, suggesting that the Stafford hospital scandal was far from a one-off. Tories will seize on the findings to attack Labour’s handling of the health service. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is expected to tell MPs today that at least ten of the trusts are being placed in ‘special measures’, with NHS troubleshooters sent in to take over their management and high risk services suspended. In the leaked email, Professor Jarman, a former president of the British Medical Association and expert on hospital death rates who now advises the Government, noted Mr Burnham’s ‘public statements that you are dedicated to reducing death rates in English hospitals’. He said he had send data identifying 25 hospital trusts which in 2007/08 had one of several ‘mortality alerts’ or over 150 more deaths than expected in that year. Professor Jarman noted that Basildon and Thurrock, Tameside and Mid Staffordshire trusts had had high mortality rates for around ten years - but had been deemed to have ‘fair’ or ‘good’ levels of care by watchdogs. Saying a process of ‘self assessment’ used by health regulators ‘may be fundamentally flawed’, he said ‘on-site’ inspections suggested poor standards at all three. ‘I realise that on-site inspections are relatively expensive but I thought that it might be possible to arrange on-site inspections for the high HSMR [hospital standardised mortality rates] hospitals,’ he added. Mid Staffs went on to be at the centre of the biggest NHS scandal in a generation. A review of deaths at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust by police and other officials has identified hundreds of cases between 2005 and 2009 where poor care could have led to deaths. In an email sent in 2010, seen by the Daily Mail, then Health Secretary Andy Burnham was given a list of hospitals where he warned there were alarming numbers of patient deaths . Professor Jarman noted that Basildon and Thurrock, Tameside and Mid Staffordshire trusts had had high mortality rates for around ten years - but had been deemed to have 'fair' or ¿good¿ levels of care by watchdogs . In all, Professor Jarman estimated the deaths at the trusts he identified amounted to 4,609 in 2007/08 and over 20,000 in total. In a reply to his letter, sent in April 2010 as the parties prepared for a general election the following month, a junior health minister, Baroness Thornton, told him it would be more appropriate to take up his concerns with the Care Quality Commission. A Tory source said: ‘This is yet further evidence that Andy Burnham personally had information about failing trusts which he failed to act upon. Labour claim to be the party of the NHS but ignoring warning signs and covering up failure lets down both the NHS and the patients it serves.’ Conservative MP Priti Patel tabled the questions in Parliament suggesting more than 1,500 further representations were made to Labour ministers about the trusts with high death rates . Six of the 14 hospitals which have been subject of Professor Keogh’s review were on the original list sent to Mr Burnham, now Labour’s shadow health secretary: Basildon, Tameside, Colchester, Blackpool, George Eliot in Warwickshire and United Lincolnshire. Separately, questions in Parliament suggested more than 1,500 further representations were made to Labour ministers about the trusts with high death rates. They included over 400 letters about United Lincolnshire, 300 letters about Blackpool and over 200 letters about Basildon. Conservative MP Priti Patel, who tabled the questions, said: ‘Andy Burnham must take responsibility for Labour’s record: thousands of unnecessary deaths, an appalling cover-up on his watch, and a wall of silence. 'New evidence suggests Labour ignored more than 1,500 warnings about these hospitals, where there was terrible suffering and cruelty. 'Andy Burnham must now apologise to the families who lost loved ones. He must publish the official papers he is keeping secret. And he must support the NHS reforms that the Conservatives are making, to put caring back at the heart of our NHS.’ Labour has strongly denied putting pressure on the healthcare regulator and other NHS organisations to cover up bad news in the run up to the 2010 general election. The party is expected to attempt to blame falling numbers of staff in areas such as midwifery and a decline in meeting its four -hour A&E target as being responsible for some of the latest failures in the NHS. A source close to Ed Miliband said: ‘In every one of these hospital trusts we are seeing standards declining, not because of what Andy Burnham did. This government has spent £3 billion on an unnecessary reorganisation of the NHS.' ‘We will reject what is a political attempt by this government to undermine the health service.’","Professor Brian Jarman warned of high death rates in 25 hospitals in 2010 .

But the Iranian born restaurateur, who lives in Bayswater, west London, was convicted of unlawful wounding by a majority of 11-to-one, after eight-and-a-half hours of deliberation. Bailing Safaei ahead of sentence on February 21, Judge Martin Beddoe told him: ‘The real issue is whether there might be circumstances where I could suspend the sentence and direct you to do various things to make reparations. I’m undecided about that.’ Mr Buttery had briefly performed the Cole Porter trick in court as he described his version of events to jurors.

Wearing a dark red shirt and his trademark funky black glasses, the TV star was handed a tissue by court staff after becoming emotional while giving evidence. Attacked: Sam Buttery (pictured on The Voice with presenter Holly Willoughby) was mistaken for a girl in the blind auditions of the talent contest . Mr Buttery was with his flamboyant friend Daniel Lismore - who has been dubbed ‘London’s most outrageous dresser’- at the time. Wearing a black hat and cape over a smart black suit, with his long brown hair tied in a low-ponytail, Mr Lismore claimed Safaei shouted at his friend: ‘Go to the gym.’ Safaei then said ‘something about being fat’ to his friend, he said. Moments later a champagne glass ‘whistled’ past his head, Mr Lismore said. ‘Obviously I was shocked at what I had just seen, and my friend was gushing with blood. ‘I saw him (Safaei) throw it, I saw the glass leave his hand, but I turned at that point. I ducked, as I didn’t know if it was going to hit me or not.’ The actor, DJ and stylist insisted Mr Buttery’s behaviour was not the result of him being drunk. ‘Sam played Leigh Bowery in Taboo which is an amazing musical and he didn’t need a drink to do that. I know what he is like when he is drunk and he didn’t appear to be drunk. ‘I think Sam has had enough of people commenting on his image and he said he didn’t understand what makes someone say that. ‘We are both quite successful in our careers and we don’t have time to mess around.’ Mr Lismore said he tried to stop his friend from confronting Safaei. ‘I don’t like negativity of any kind, especially hatred, which I believe it was for no reason.’ 'I think Sam has had enough of people commenting on his image and he said he didn’t understand what makes someone say that' Daniel Lismore, friend of Sam Buttery . But he added: ‘I think he (Mr Buttery) was welcome to ask ‘why have you just attacked me in the street?’, we want to know why someone is prosecuting us in society. ‘ . Mr Buttery once claimed in a magazine interview that he punched Voice judge Will.i.am for nicknaming him ‘Butters’ - meaning ‘butt ugly’. The singer was also mistaken for a girl in the blind auditions of the talent contest. Neither the TV star or Mr Lismore were present in court for the verdict. Safaei denied but was convicted of unlawful wounding.","Talent show finalist 'drew attention to himself' in Soho, court hears .

Jauntily waving a Union flag and happily demonstrating the perfect curtsey, a very patriotic fan was waiting for the Queen as she visited Reed's School in Cobham this morning. But this was no average well-wisher: Instead, the Queen was greeted by a robot Royal enthusiast made by pupils at the school. Despite being unable to offer much in the way of small talk, the 2ft robot certainly seemed to get the royal seal of approval, as the Queen looked on, apparently fascinated by its antics. Greeting: The Queen beams as she arrives at Reed's School to find a patriotic row of Union Jack waving pupils . Happily for pupils, the robot wasn't the only member of the school to receive a smile from the monarch. Arriving at the school, of which she is patron, Her Majesty was greeted by a sea of cheering pupils, all giving the robot a run for its money in the flag-waving stakes. Later, after meeting students, the Queen was given a tour of the science department, inspecting the projects on display and chatting to pupils. Reed's School, of which the Queen is patron, is celebrating its bicentary this year and was founded in 1813 in the east end of London as the London Orphan Asylum. Approval: The Queen appears pleased with the row of royal robots she encountered during the visit . All smiles: The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh both looked in fine fettle as they arrived at the school . Good day: The Queen is patron of Reed's School and certainly appeared to enjoy chatting with pupils . For the visit, the monarch was joined for the visit by the Duke of Edinburgh who looked in fine fettle as he toured the premises, despite a recent run of bad health. The Queen herself looked typically elegant in a neat pearl-grey tweed suit, worn with a matching hat and a chic diamond brooch, as well as her trademark Launer handbag. And the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh weren't the only Royals to be spotted devoting time to good causes today. Prince Harry spent the morning playing volleyball with a group of disabled athletes as he helped to launch the Invictus Games at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford. Inspection: A group of pupils explain the inner workings of their science projects to the Queen . What's that all about? A pupil gives the Queen a science lesson with the help of a few props . The Invictus Games are a new international sporting event for wounded, injured and sick members of the Armed Forces, and during the launch, the Prince called for people to set aside personal beliefs about the conflict in Afghanistan and support casualties of war. Harry has been working behind the scenes to bring the Games to London since last year, when he attended the US equivalent, the Warrior Games, during a visit to the country. Nations that are scheduled to participate in the Invictus Games include Germany, New Zealand, Italy, Iraq and Afghanistan. Speaking at the event, the Prince said: 'We are drawing down from Afghanistan and people will forget this because something else will come into the news. Look at the news, see how busy the world is at the moment.' 'It's not about supporting the conflict in Afghanistan, it's not about supporting war, it's not about supporting the forces themselves.....just come along and show your support.'

Detained: Patrick Rock, a key adviser to David Cameron and deputy director of the No 10 policy unit, resigned and was arrested almost three weeks ago . Downing Street was last night facing allegations of a cover-up over the child porn arrest of one of David Cameron’s oldest friends. Patrick Rock, 62, deputy director of the No 10 policy unit, resigned and was arrested almost three weeks ago. But Downing Street said nothing, only choosing to confirm his arrest and departure after being questioned on Monday by the Daily Mail. Not even senior ministers had been informed. Officials yesterday confirmed Mr Rock had also previously been the subject of a formal sexual harassment complaint understood to involve a high-flying woman civil servant. She moved out of No 10 to another department after the case had been examined by Mr Cameron’s chief of staff Ed Llewellyn. Yesterday, Labour insisted it was extraordinary that a senior figure could resign in such circumstances without any public announcement. No 10 faced also awkward questions about why Mr Rock was confronted with the child pornography allegations and allowed to quietly resign hours before the police were called in. Incredibly, outside Mr Cameron’s close circle, only Home Secretary Theresa May was informed of Mr Rock’s resignation. On a dramatic day in the affair: . Downing Street was first made aware of a potential offence on February 12, when the matter was apparently brought to Mr Cameron’s attention. Mr Rock – who has been closely involved in drawing up Government policy on internet porn filters – resigned later that day and was reported to the National Crime Agency. He was arrested at his home in West London in the early hours of February 13. Police were also invited into Downing Street to examine IT systems and the office used by Mr Rock. David Cameron and Angela Merkel outside No10 last week: Officials faced awkward questions about why Mr Rock was confronted with the child porn allegations and allowed to quietly resign before police were called in . The senior No 10 aide quizzed by police over child porn offences has also faced a serious sexual harassment allegation, it was confirmed last night. Until now Downing Street has  refused to comment. Patrick Rock was accused by a woman civil servant who worked on major matters of government policy. Highest level: David Cameron's chief of staff Ed Llewellyn treated the case of Mr Rock's alleged sexual harassment of female colleague 'very seriously' The woman is understood to be younger than Mr Rock and has worked across Whitehall. However, in another example of the secrecy surrounding the Rock affair, officials have refused to say when the complaint was made and what the details of her allegations were. But, such was the sensitivity of the case, it was treated ‘very seriously’ by David Cameron’s chief of staff Ed Llewellyn. It is understood the woman  has now transferred to another Whitehall department following consultation with Mr Rock. The allegation is not, however, thought to be  related in any way to Mr Rock’s arrest. The woman’s identity is known to this newspaper but is not being published to protect  her privacy. Officials yesterday flatly refused to discuss any of the details  of the claim against Mr Rock  and whether he faced any  formal censure. Last night No 10 dismissed rumours that the complainant had been unhappy with the handling of the case. A spokesman insisted it had been ‘appropriately resolved’ with the ‘consent and in consultation with the individual that raised the issue’. ‘I can confirm that a complaint around alleged inappropriate behaviour was raised. ‘The matter was dealt with very seriously at senior levels in  full accordance with the Cabinet Office’s human resources  policy,’ the Prime Minister’s spokesman said. Asked why it had taken so long for No 10 to come clean about the resignation of such a senior aide, Mr Cameron said: ‘First of all, I have to be careful what I say about this issue because there is a criminal investigation underway. From yesterday's Mail . 'Obviously when I heard these allegations I was profoundly shocked and I remain profoundly shocked. ‘In terms of the release of this information, I do not think it would be right to pre-emptively speak about a criminal investigation and that is why we did not do that. 'As questions were asked and as questions will inevitably be asked, we have given very full and straightforward answers, which is absolutely the right way to handle this situation. ‘I’ve been clear right along, when I was first told about this issue – pretty much as soon as it was discovered – that we must handle this in absolutely the correct way. 'I am satisfied that this is what No 10 has done. He did play an important role at Downing Street.’ 'I have to be careful what I say': David Cameron, left, said he was 'profoundly shocked' by the allegations. But Labour MP Tom Watson, right, said the PM cannot just bury his head in the sand and hope the issue goes away . A senior Labour source said Mr Rock’s departure was ‘clearly in the public interest’ and questions were being asked about ‘whether Downing Street sat on this information in order to exploit what was happening with Harriet Harman’. Miss Harman has faced controversy in recent weeks over links between a civil liberties organisation she used to work for and a paedophile group. A Labour source said questions had been asked about whether No10 'sat on' information to exploit the outcry over Harriet Harman's links to PIE . Tom Watson, a senior Labour MP who is . calling for a public inquiry into child abuse allegations, said: ‘I . fully understand No 10 has a duty of care to a former staff member who . hasn’t yet been charged. People expect answers to their legitimate . questions though. 'Did Mr Rock go through developed vetting [for security clearance]? Why did he appear to have advance notice of police involvement? Mr Cameron cannot put his head in the sand and hope this goes away.’ Mr Rock has yet to comment on the allegations against him, and has not been charged with any offence. A Downing Street source said: ‘Any decision to proactively announce the arrest is clearly a matter for the National Crime Agency. 'It would have been completely inappropriate for us to have ignored the police and made such an announcement, not least because it might have jeopardised the investigation.’ Mr Cameron and Mr Rock worked together as special advisers to Michael Howard in his time as home secretary in the mid-1990s. Mr Rock later worked for Lord Patten during his time as a European commissioner in Brussels. The Prime Minister brought him back into government in 2011. In the policy unit, Mr Rock helped broker a deal with internet firms which means millions of households are being asked if they want family friendly filters to screen out porn from their computers.","Patrick Rock resigned and was arrested nearly three weeks ago .

Ukip supporters and Eurosceptic Tories are making it harder to stop Scotland voting to leave the UK, Vince Cable will warn today. The Lib Dem Business Secretary will use a speech tonight to accuse right-wing parties of British ‘indulging in British nationalism and Euro-separatism’. He will tell his party’s spring conference in York that people calling for Britain to leave the EU made it harder to persuade Scots to ignore the ‘siren voices of nationalism and separatism’. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable accuses Ukip of putting the union at risk . Voters in Scotland will have their say on independence in a referendum on September 18. Senior Conservatives are conscious that the arguments about Scotland remaining in the UK, including on employment, economy and global influence, also apply to Britain’s EU membership. David Cameron has promised to negotiate a ‘fresh settlement’ with Brussels before staging an in-out referendum by 2017. But Mr Cable will warn the uncertainty is damaging the British economy, with the Tories plunged into a ‘UKIP induced funk’. He will say: ‘The possibility of a Tory government after the election and the uncertainty around a referendum in three years’ time is creating a blight over the business investment which we desperately need to support recovery and jobs. ‘And let me say this to UKIP and so-called Eurosceptics in the Tory party.  You are also putting at risk the union of the UK. ‘How on Earth do you expect to persuade . the Scots to ignore the siren voices of nationalism and separatism when . you indulge in British nationalism and Euro-separatism?’ The rise of Nigel Farage's Ukip has put pressure on the Tory party to present a more Eurosceptic front . Some members of the UK Independence Party are  ‘literally akin to the Nazis’, according to a Tory MP. In . an incendiary attack ahead of the European elections, Robert Halfon . said the anti-EU party had played a helpful role in ‘cleansing’ the . Conservatives of people with extreme views. Mr . Halfon, an ally of Chancellor George Osborne and Tory chairman Grant . Shapps, cited the example of UKIP immigration spokesman Gerard Batten, . who believes that British Muslims should sign a special code of conduct . rejecting violence. He cited . the example of UKIP immigration spokesman Gerard Batten, who believes . that British Muslims should sign a special code of conduct rejecting . violence. Mr Halfon, who is . Jewish, said: ‘To me there are two kinds of UKIP – the [former defence . spokesman] Godfrey Bloom guy who’s like a cross between Sid James and . Bernard Manning, and then there's a much more sinister element, like the . MEP who said every Muslim has got to sign a declaration of . non-violence, which to me is literally akin to the Nazis saying Jews . should wear a yellow star. ‘I . genuinely find it abhorrent and frightening. I'm amazed that man is . still an MEP. How someone could say such a thing and then not apologise . for it…’ The pro-independence campaign has suffered a string of setbacks this week, with big business lining up to warn against separation. Investment and savings business Alliance Trust today became the latest firm to say it is to set up additional companies in England as a result of uncertainty surrounding the independence referendum. The 125-year-old Dundee-based business said it was taking the precaution in order to protect its customers regardless of the outcome in September. The trust currently has offices in Dundee, Edinburgh and London. In a statement outlining the company's annual results, chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox said: ‘2014 is an important year for Scotland. The referendum in September is creating uncertainty for our customers and our business, which we have a responsibility to address.’ It follows warnings from oil giants BP and Shell, banks RBS and Lloyds and pensions firm Standard Life about the threat to their business and investment caused by Scotland going it alone. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has also struggled to counter the warning from the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems that they would block a currency union allowing an independent Scotland to continue using the pound. Mr Salmond has accused the Westminster parties of ‘bullying and bluster’, and insisted a currency union could still be agreed if voters back independence. But today Lib Dem Danny Alexander will insist the decision is final. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury will say: ‘I've seen some people suggest we are not serious about refusing a currency union. ‘Let's call this the John McEnroe defence. Except in this instance it's not just one person they're shouting at, but three. ‘And our decision - taken in the best interests of Scotland and the rest of the UK - is final. ‘No ifs, no buts. No matter how much of a racket they make, it isn't going to change.’ Generator and heating supplier Aggreko warned yesterday that Scottish independence would lead to 'years of uncertainty and hiatus' for the business. Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, Standard Life, Royal Bank of Scotland, the Macfarlane Group and Breedon Aggregates have all listed independence in their risk management sections of their annual reports. But other high-profile business figures have voiced support for independence, including Willie Walsh, the boss of British Airways' parent company, who said last month that a Yes vote in September could be a 'positive development'.","Business Secretary uses conference speech to attack Eurosceptics .

Plaid Cymru's Neil McEvoy, a former deputy leader of Cardiff City Council, claims the leaflet implied that he was 'not to be trusted'. However, Labour councillor Michael Michael, who distributed the image, insists that it was not meant to be taken literally. Court battle: Neil McEvoy, left, is suing Michael Michael, right, over a leaflet depicting him as Del Boy . The leaflet, which shows a cartoon of Del Boy superimposed with Mr McEvoy's face, was distributed in the Fairwater area of the Welsh capital. It carried a message saying it was 'printed and promoted' by Mr Michael, chair of the council's planning committee. Mr McEvoy is now suing Mr Michael, arguing that it is defamatory to refer to a public figure as 'Del Boy'. Barristers for the two rival councillors put forward legal arguments at a High Court hearing in Cardiff this week. David Hughes, for Mr McEvoy, said: 'We all know who Del Boy is. He's not to be trusted. He's a rogue. Which of us would like to be compared to Del Boy?' 'Rogue': The character played by David Jason in Only Fools and Horses was devoted to get-rich-quick schemes . But Hugh Tomlinson QC, for Mr Michael, said: 'The comparison between Del Boy and the claimant wouldn't be taken literally by readers of the leaflet. 'Suggesting that Councillor McEvoy is like Del Boy Trotter because he is a roguish character and a fantasist is obviously a comment rather than a statement of fact and can't be read in any other way.' The lawyer added that he was 'in a minority of one' because he had never watched Only Fools and Horses and did not previously know who Del Boy was. The leaflet was approved by local Assembly Member Mark Drakeford, Wales's health minister, the court heard. Judge Andrew Keyser QC reserved judgement in the case.

Identified: This photo provided by the California Department of Motor Vehicles shows Alan Oliver Frazier, named as the Reno gunman . Officials in Nevada have identified the suspect in Tuesday's deadly hospital shooting as 51-year-old California resident Alan Oliver Frazier. Frazier is accused of killing a doctor and wounding two other people before turning a 12-gauge shotgun on himself inside Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno. On Wednesday, investigators converged on Frazier's one-story home in Lake Almanor in Plumas County, California - some two hours northwest of Reno. Officers executed a search warrant at the alleged shooter's home on Evergreen Circle in the hopes of discovering some clues or information on his relatives. Police were able to identify Frazier and locate his home after running the license plate number on a GMC pickup truck that was abandoned in the parking lot of the Center for Advanced Medicine in Reno. Frazier's neighbor Mike Hawthorne recalled to Reno Gazette Journal that the last time he saw the man alive, the 51-year-old told him 'he wasn't coming back.' Killer's home: Police exercised a search warrant at Frazier's home in Lake Almanor, California - some 120 miles from Reno . Mr Hawthorne's wife, Jeannette, described the gunman as an avid hunter and fisherman who enjoyed playing with his dog and was a good neighbor. During snowstorms, Mrs Hawthorne said, Frazier would plow everyone’s driveways with his Bobcat. While police are still looking for a motive behind the crime, people who knew Frazier believe the shooting may be related to a medical procedure he had undergone in Reno. Slain: Charles G. Gholdoian was murdered Tuesday when a suicidal gunman police now say was on a mission of violence entered the Reno hospital where he worked and opened fire . Neighbors Bob and Jan Hammill had . known Frazier for 20 years. According to the couple, the man suffered . from medical complications following a surgery performed on him a few . years ago. It remains . unknown if either of the two doctors shot Tuesday had treated Frazier in . the past. So far, detectives have been unable to establish a . relationship between Frazier and the three victims: two physicians and a . relative of a patient. The Hammills said that Frazier used to work at a wood-burning power plant that closed two years ago. ‘He’s a very good man and I’m shocked he hurt other people,’ Mrs Hammill told the paper. Officials . from the local sheriff's department said that over the past decade, . they were called to Frazier's address twice: once for a disturbance, and . the second time for an act of vandalism targeting the homeowner. Police believe Frazier was on a mission of violence when he entered a third-floor urology office and opened fire with a 12-gauge shotgun after warning patients and their children in a waiting area to ‘get out.’ Charles G. Gholdoian, 46, was shot and killed at the scene. His colleague Dr. Christine Lajeunesse and a visitor to the hospital, Shawntae Spears, 20, were each shot once, but survived. As Spears and Lajeunesse try to recover in the very hospital where they were shot, police have undertaken an investigation of the unnamed gunman, who motive eludes them thus far. ‘But the fact the shooter went through . the first and second floor, made his way to the third floor of the . building, would indicate to me it is not a random event,’ said Reno . Deputy Police Chief Mac Venzo. A . witness who was among those the shooter passed in the waiting room said . Wednesday that Frazier could have killed many more . people at the Reno medical complex if that was his intent. Holding on: Dr. Christine Lajeunesse, left, was a colleague of the slain Dr. Gholdoian's and was critical condition but conscious on Wednesday. Shawntae Spears, 20, (right) was shot by the 12-guage shotgun as well. Her condition was upgraded from critical to serious on Wednesday . Gun violence: the gunman turned the shotgun on himself after opening fire on the third floor of Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno, Nevada . Detectives . have not been able to establish any relationship the man may have had . with the two doctors and the relative of a patient who were shot Tuesday . before the gunman killed himself. ‘While . we piece this thing together, we are trying to figure out what that . relationship is, if there is a relationship at all,’ said Chief Mac . Venzo. Innocent victim? Lajeunesse is a urologist at Urology Nevada and remained listed in critical condition on Wednesday as police struggled to determine why a still unnamed Northern California man burst into her department and shot up the place before killing himself . Gholdoian, a . urologist at Urology Nevada within the Center for Advanced Medicine on . the campus of the Renown Regional Medical Center was killed at the . scene. ‘Urology Nevada . is shocked and saddened by the events that occurred,’ the medical center . said in a statement. ‘At this time we have no information as to why . these terrible events occurred, and we are cooperating with the . authorities in every way possible to learn more.’ Dr. Michael Morkin, an emergency room surgeon and the incoming chief of . staff at Renown, where the victims were taken, said both doctors were . his friends. He described them as ‘exceptional physicians.’ ‘It is a very difficult time for the medical community,’ he told reporters. Spears' condition improved Wednesday from critical to serious, the hospital said. Friends told Reno Gazette Journal the mother of two was in good spirits Wednesday and wrote on Facebook, ‘I am OK. Message me if you want to visit.’ ‘She has two little boys and she so enjoys being a mom,’ said Spears' friend Denna Tinnin Klink. Lajeunesse was conscious Wednesday but remained in critical condition at Renown, hospital officials said. Police were withholding the name of the killer because they said they still have not been able to reach his next of kin. 'I am OK': Spears has two sons and friends say she is a deeply devoted mother. Thankfully, it appears she'll be reunited with her boys very soon . No connection? Police had yet to find a connection between the victims including Spears (left) and the unnamed shooter, who was a resident of the Northern California town of Lake Almanor . Plumas County Sheriff Greg Hagwood said Frazier was a long-time resident of the community of Lake Almanor and lived alone. ‘Part . of the investigation and service of the search warrant was to help . identify next of kin,’ Hagwood told AP, adding that authorities have . established he has California relatives outside of Plumas County. He . said investigators were ‘taking every measure possible to make . notification of family as quickly as they can so they're not watching . the news and having the unsettling experience of finding out that way.’ Crime scene: The shooting happened inside Centers for Advanced Medicine B on East 2nd Street, but the shooter confusingly lived 120 miles from Reno, in Lake Almanor . Bringing the big guns: SWAT team members are trucked from near the Renown helicopter pad to the Renown Medical Center on Tuesday after shots rang out around 2pm . Police said there were about 100 people in the office building when authorities were alerted at 2.05pm Tuesday about an ‘active shooter.’ Venzo said investigators have talked to 29 witnesses, with more interviews pending. Vitalis Ozoude, a state auditor, was in the reception area of Urology Nevada with his wife and 3-year-old son waiting for his child's appointment when the gunman walked in and eventually told them and others to leave. ‘I don't think he meant to kill everybody because if he did he had ample opportunity to do that,’ Ozoude told AP. He said the dozen or so people in the waiting room didn't immediately react to the sight of a man carrying the gun because he seemed calm. ‘He looked like he belonged. I thought he worked there, and he was just getting a gun from his car or taking it to his office,’ he said. Lockdown: Police swarmed the hospital following the deadly incident . Vicki Green, another patient who said she was standing within an arm's length of the shooter at one time, said he ‘seemed calm, yet agitated at the same time.’ ‘He started swinging the gun and telling everybody in the waiting room, `You need to get out, you better get out, you should get out,'‘ Green told KRNV-TV. ‘People started picking up their stuff and their kids and running.’ Venzo said the gunman went past the front desk at the urologist's office and entered the patient examination rooms. Moving through the exam area, Frazier fired at least four rounds from the shotgun, striking the three victims, before making his way back to the office's waiting area and turning the gun on himself, police said.

A Detroit house that was turned into an art installation has been burned to the ground - the sixth home in the beloved Heidelberg Project to be attacked by arsonists since May. The home, called 'Party Animal' or 'Doll House' was adorned with stuffed animals and dolls by artist Tyree Guyton, who has been decorating vacant homes in run-down neighborhoods of the decaying city since 1986. Arson investigator Lieutenant Joseph Crandall says crews responded at 3am Friday to the blaze that ultimately burned the house to the ground. Burned to the ground: The 'Party Animal House' is pictured in November. Arson is suspected in the fire that destroyed it Friday . Nothing left: Only the foundation of the house now remains after a raging inferno engulfed it early Friday . The wood-frame house was quickly . engulfed in flames and firefighters said there was nothing they could do . to save it by the time they arrived. No injuries were reported in the fire, but a house next door was damaged. The Heidelberg Project homes have become a city landmark, visited by residents and tourists alike, who visit the art exhibition that sprawls across a neighborhood on Detroit's east side, according to the Detroit News. Each house is a different theme and all of them are decorated by found objects. Not everyone likes the project. Since May, seven Heidelberg homes have been hit by eight different fires. Counting Friday's Doll House, six have burned to the ground. Tragic: Artist Tyree Guyton, seen here in November when 'House of Soul' burned down, is working to revitalize his Detroit neighborhood with the Heidelberg Project . Another casualty: 'House of Soul' burned down in November . Detroit police and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives believe arson is to blame in all of the fires. The first house hit was 'Obstruction of Justice' last May. Then in November, 'House of Soul,' 'The Penny House' and 'War House' were all burned to the ground. 'Clock House' was torched in December. 'There just aren't words for this. Party Animal is gone. Please send us your love today,' the Heidelberg Project tweeted. This isn't the first time that the artist's installations have been destroyed. In 1991 and again in 1999, two different mayoral administrations ordered six houses featuring Tyree Guyton's work to be demolished because the buildings were derelict. Some neighbors don't like the art project - they say the decorated homes attract a lot of unwanted traffic to the neighborhood - tourists from the suburbs and even from out-of-town. Investigators believe the 'House of Soul' fire was set by an arsonist, as well .","The Heidelberg Project has seen a local artist decorating vacant houses in a Detroit neighborhood for 30 years .

Wanted man: A nationwide manhunt is under way for Harry Mapps, 59, who is suspected of killing three people and setting their Colorado home ablaze last month . A nationwide search is underway for a former long-distance trucker who is suspected of murdering a family of three in Colorado and then setting their home on fire to cover up the crime. Harry Carl Mapps is wanted on charges of first-degree murder and arson in the November 27 shooting deaths and a blaze at the home where the bodies were found, Pueblo County Sheriff Kirk Taylor said at a news conference in Pueblo. Mapps, 59, was a friend of one victim and had been staying with him, authorities said. He said investigators have some ideas about where Mapps might go but declined to provide details. ‘He was an over-the-road truck driver. He's very familiar with some less-traveled roads across the country,’ Taylor said. Taylor said Mapps should be considered armed and dangerous. He declined to say what kind of weapon he might have. The bodies of 51-year-old Reginald Tuttle, his wife, 55-year-old Kim Tuttle, and their daughter, 33-year-old Dawn Roderick, were found in the remains of the home outside the small town of Rye. Roderick lived in nearby Pueblo with her husband and four children and was visiting her parents at the time of the shootings. Victims: Kim Tuttle (far right), her husband Reginald (second right), and their 33-year-old daughter, Dawn (far left), were shot dead November 27 . Inferno: The Tuttles' Rye home was set ablaze to cover up the murders . No good deed: Police say Mapps, a trucker, was staying with Reginald Tuttle and his wife . Mapps was a friend of Mr Tuttle's and had been working for his trucking company while living with him and his wife, authorities said. ‘He took the mother of my children,’ an inconsolable Mark Roderick, Dawn's husband, told CBS Denver. ‘Kind of disbelief. I had never seen him [Mapps] violent, I’ve never even seen him lose his temper, so I’m kind of in disbelief, but just real surprised.’ Taylor said investigators have received hundreds of tips and followed all of them. He said Mapps' last known location was the town of La Junta in southeastern Colorado, where authorities said he cashed a check made out to one of the victims. An earlier warrant for Mapps' arrest listed charges of theft, identity theft and forgery, all related to the alleged check theft. Happier times: Kim and Reginald, seen here on their wedding day more than three decades ago, are survived by their son . Mapps was a friend of Mrs Tuttle and worked for his trucking business; his wife was a baker . Slain daughter: Dawn Roderick, a married mother of four, was visiting her parents at the time of the shooting . Authorities identified Mapps as a suspect in the deaths three days after the fire, but the murder and arson charges were not announced until Thursday. Taylor said the warrants took time to process. ‘The new charges will make him one of the most sought-after fugitives in the country,’ the sheriff said. ‘Law-enforcement agencies nationwide will not want a triple-homicide suspect on the streets.’ The warrant is sealed and no details have been released. Troubled marriage: Sandy Mapps (left), Harry Mapps' estranged wife, said she had kicked him out of their home in Texas last spring . A federal fugitive arrest warrant has also been issued for Mapps, U.S. Marshal John Kammerzell said. Mapps was initially described as a handyman. His estranged wife, Sandy Mapps, told The Denver Post she ordered him to leave their home in Dimmitt, Texas, last spring. He quit a farm labor job in Texas and moved to Colorado, she said. Mrs Mapps has been using her Facebook page to spread the message about her husband’s manhunt, posting regular updates on the progress of the investigation. Fugitive: Mapps is considered armed and dangerous. He was last seen driving a blue 2004 Chevrolet mini-van with the Texas license plate . A $5,000 reward is being offered for information leading to Mapps’ arrest. The fugitive was last seen driving a blue 2004 Chevrolet mini-van with the Texas license plate 7FSNK.

But a new study claims that surgeries performed by robots are no more successful than relying on a human surgeon using traditional instruments. In addition this, the research has found that robotic surgeons are considerably more expensive too. But a new study claims that surgeries performed with the aid of robots (pictured) are no more successful than relying solely on a human surgeon using traditional instruments - but they are more expensive . Researchers examined robotic and traditional surgery methods in performing colectomies – surgical procedures that remove areas of the large intestine. The study, by Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, found that robots could not outperform humans when it came to complications and mortality rates as well as the length of time patients took to recover in hospital. However, the research, which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, (JAMA) claims that surgical procedures using robots cost on average $3,000 (£1,836) more those that do not. The scientists looked at 244,129 colectomies performed during 2008 to 2010 on patients over the age of 21. Previous evidence has shown using these robots, rather than surgeon's hands, results in less blood loss, reduced risk of blood transfusion and a shorter overall recovery time .

The study, which compared the results of . robotic and human surgeries, found that the robotic operations were more . expensive and cost an extra $2,100 (£1,285) per procedure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently investigating the safety of robotic surgery and the manufacturers of a robot widely used in keyhole surgery, admitted its arms could stall and seize up while performing delicate operations. Intuitive Surgical has put out an ‘urgent medical device recall’ for the robotic arms of its da Vinci Surgical System, which is used to treat cancer and has been credited with reducing the side-effects of surgery. There have been reported problems with the system, including several disturbing incidents including a robotic hand that wouldn't let go of tissue grasped during surgery and a robotic arm hitting a patient in the face as she lay on the operating table. These accidents - and even several deaths linked to the system - have led to investigation. The problem could affect 1,386 robotic arms in use across the world, according to the FDA. A statement on the company’s website said stalling in the robotic arms of the system could result in a sudden ‘catch up’ if a surgeon perseveres with a move, despite slight resistance from the machine. The da Vinci has four spider like arms, controlled by the surgeon, which hold cutting instruments to make tiny incisions and remove cancerous tissue part using images from a telescope to guide the surgeon.

For surgeons, who control the robot while sitting at a computer screen rather than standing over the patient, these operations can be less tiring - and robotic hands don't shake.

Commons Speaker John Bercow spent £48,024.06 in just six months on travels around the UK and the globe . John Bercow has defied critics of his taxpayer-funded jet set lifestyle, and clocked up another £48,000 on travel in just six months. The Commons Speaker flew business class to Burma and New Zealand before jetting off to Antalya on the Mediterranean, taking his total travel bill since the general election to almost £150,000. The latest revelations about spending on planes, trains, taxis and hotels come after MailOnline last year exposed how he had clocked up trips to 20 countries since the election. In the wake of the revelations about his travel costs, Mr Bercow pledged to publish his expenses in full. From June to December last year, total travel and accommodation costs came to £48,027.06, with more invoices yet to arrive. In six months Mr Bercow clocked up £1,200 on train travel for himself and aides, £1,959.75 on hotels and £34,550.05 on flights. It includes £16,496.30 for Mr Bercow to fly business class from Heathrow to Burma, then on to New Zealand and back to the UK. One night at the five star Langham Hotel in Auckland cost £229.60 for Mr Bercow and an aide. Two nights at the Intercontinental in Wellington cost another £624.15. To add to the bill another £16,661.75 was spent flying three MPs and two members of staff to join Mr Bercow on his travels around Burma. Then in August last year he spent £344.60 flying to Antalya in Turkey, and back again. Travel by his official car cost £2,507.74 for six months, including a £388 from Westminster to Hertfordshire for an ‘outreach’ event. He also took his taxpayer-funded limo to the Attitude magazine awards, costing £172. The TaxPayers' Alliance's Dia Chakravarty told The Sun: ‘Politicians should not bill hard-pressed taxpayers for business-class flights and fancy hotels, particularly when the public finances are in such a state. ‘If trips abroad are absolutely necessary then costs must be kept down and good value for money sought.’ Sights: In August last year Mr Bercow flew to Burma (left) before travelling on to Auckland, New Zealand (right) Since May 2010, Mr Bercow has spent almost £150,000 on travels as Speaker .

Questions . were first raised about Mr Bercow's foreign jaunts after it emerged . that he used a speech to the Romanian Parliament in May to suggest . eastern European migrants show 'more aptitude and commitment' to work . than British people. The revelations came amid growing anger among MPs at their treatment at the hands of Mr Bercow during debates in the Commons. Tory MP Ian Liddell-Grainger said at the time that he feared for Britain’s reputation around the world if Mr Bercow is acting as its ambassador. He said: ‘Given that he seems to be anti-MPs, it is a little rich to discover that he is spending thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money, presumably being as rude as he can to other countries. ‘Given his performance in the House, I hate to think what he is saying to Members of Parliament and officials around the world.’ A spokesman for Mr Bercow said: 'One . of the Speaker’s duties is to represent Parliament at home and abroad.

Like a scene from hell, flames engulfed Kiev this week as thousands of masked protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at heavily armed riot police surging forward behind huge metal shields. Their massed ranks responded with tear gas, stun grenades — one of which was reported to have blown off a marcher’s hand — and, fatally, shotguns. Two protesters fell dead after being hit by bullets, one of having been hit in the head, neck and chest. Like a scene from hell, flames engulfed Kiev this week as thousands of masked protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at heavily armed riot police . Police have responded to the protestors with tear gas, stun grenades and, fatally, shotguns . It was the most violent exchange yet, following weeks of clashes during which hundreds of thousands of protesters have thronged the streets of Ukraine’s capital, yearning to overthrow their authoritarian, pro-Moscow government. Now, as heavy snow blankets the city, they continue to defend their barricades, claiming they are ready to fight ‘to the end’. Opposition leaders have issued an ultimatum to the president, Viktor Yanukovych, to call early elections in the coming days and scrap new anti-protest laws, or face further violence. The most iconic figure to emerge as a rallying point for the uprising is the world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, his hulking 6ft 7in frame a steely symbol of defiance at the heart of the demonstrations. Yet he has not been reckless in his rhetoric. Last night, the pugilist-turned-politician — whose fans call him Dr Ironfist because he has a doctorate in sports science — was reported to have urged protesters to observe an eight-hour truce ahead of talks with President Yanukovych. ‘I will return to you and inform you of the result of the talks,’ he was quoted as telling protesters. ‘Keep the barricades in place, but be calm until the talks finish.’ Only a few weeks ago, his followers — who long to see true democracy flourish in this troubled nation — seemed to be winning this brutal battle of wills. They managed to topple a giant statue of Lenin — hated symbol of the repressive Soviet regime — hammering it to pieces in scenes of rage and defiance that revealed the strength of pro-Western feeling among many Ukrainians. But now, as we saw this week, the regime is determined to crush them. This is not merely a matter of internal Ukrainian politics. The battle for Kiev also symbolises Russia’s latest — and most audacious — bid to regain a hold over its former empire. Vladimir Putin, the ex-KGB hard man in the Kremlin, has muzzled his own country’s media, cowed its courts and turned its political institutions into shells. And now he wants more. The countries of the former empire must do things Russia’s way, too. The most iconic figure to emerge as a rallying point for the uprising is the world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko (pictured) Vladimir Putin, the ex-KGB hard man in the Kremlin, has muzzled his own country's media, cowed its courts and turned its political institutions into shells. And now he wants more. The countries of the former empire must do things Russia's way, too . Protestors throw stones and burning tyres amid clashes between riot police and demonstrators . The Ukrainian regime, bailed out by the Kremlin last year with cheap gas and loans, has now passed a bundle of repressive laws to cripple protest and opposition — just as in Putin’s Russia. But Ukrainians do not want to live in the Kremlin’s shadow. Desperate to escape their Soviet past, they yearn for the same legal rights, prosperity and freedom we enjoy in Europe. Sadly, they have been let down by their corrupt and incompetent rulers, who, acting as Putin’s puppets, refused last autumn to sign a trade agreement with the EU. The EU had been negotiating for closer links with Ukraine and five other ex-Soviet states for a year. But the deal fell apart at a summit in October. Instead, the thuggish Ukrainian leader turned to Russia. One great danger now is that the crackdown succeeds in Ukraine, and that its military forces effectively become integrated with Russia’s resurgent army. That would put the Kremlin’s advanced weapons within striking distance of Central Europe, and of vital European trade routes such as the Bosphorus strait in Istanbul, which links Europe and Asia. As the U.S. statesman and geopolitics expert Zbigniew Brzezinski has said: ‘Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be an empire; but with Ukraine subordinated, Russia automatically becomes an empire.’ For their part, many Russian people have watched Ukrainian protests with awe and envy. Their own opposition movement has fizzled out — steamrollered by the ruthless Russian authorities. Yet many of them yearn for the modern, democratic life that we and 500 million others in Europe take for granted. Now they despair. Two protesters fell dead after being hit by bullets, one of having been hit in the head, neck and chest during the protests . Opposition leaders have issued an ultimatum to the president, Viktor Yanukovych, to call early elections in the coming days and scrap new anti-protest laws, or face further violence . Mr Putin and his cronies have looted tens of billions of dollars in the past decade from the hapless Russian nation. People who stand in their way are jailed, killed or exiled. But to feel truly safe at home, the Kremlin also needs to feel safe abroad. Russians joke that the definition of a secure frontier is one with Russian troops on both sides. As Ukrainians’ dreams of democracy and independence begin to perish in the blood-stained snows of Kiev, that prospect is coming closer by the day. For Vladimir Putin wants to entrench his rule not only in Russia but in neighbouring countries with a new Eurasian Economic Union. Its name even apes that of the EU. But in Mr Putin’s planned union, the Kremlin’s word will rule. He will deal not with ordinary voters but with men like Ukraine’s Mr Yanukovych, or the strongman leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, another friend of the Kremlin. With the right mixture of threats and inducements, such men will do his will. And Putin will not stop at Ukraine. He has imposed arbitrary trade sanctions on other countries which dare resist him, too, including Lithuania. Others are bribed into submission. He has just struck a deal with Hungary, offering its ruler, Viktor Orban, cheap gas in exchange for a contract to build a power station there. A similar deal is brewing in Slovakia. Step by step, Russia is using the cudgel of its vast energy resources to restore power and influence in the lands it once ruled by force. And the West seems powerless to resist. Already, Nato can scarcely defend the brave but beleaguered allies we have in the area: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. And Russia and its satellite Belarus regularly rehearse plans for the invasion and occupation of these Baltic countries. Russia’s forces have even practised a nuclear attack on Warsaw. This is not merely a matter of internal Ukrainian politics. The battle for Kiev also symbolises Russia's latest - and most audacious - bid to regain a hold over its former empire . The bitter irony is that the EU has huge powers to resist Russia — if it chooses to use them. It’s humbled giant corporations such as Microsoft for mistreating European consumers, imposing huge fines when it considered the company was abusing its market position. It must do the same with Gazprom, Russia’s gas company, which throttles countries that resist the Kremlin by extorting high prices for gas sent over its monopolised pipelines. A ‘complaint’ — EU jargon for a prosecution — is imminent. It could lead to billions of dollars in fines for the Russian gas giant. Britain and other countries should applaud that — and ensure that the pro-Russian lobby in Brussels does not try to derail it. Europe should also respond to the trade sanctions Russia has imposed on its neighbours, which are a flagrant breach of international rules. But the EU is instinctively unwilling to play geopolitics, and the idea of standing up to Russia is seen as confrontational and unnecessary. Yet geopolitics is being played in front of our eyes in Ukraine and beyond — and we are losing. We need to punish Mr Yanukovych and his regime for their thuggish behaviour. We need to stand by pro-Western Ukrainians, who ask for nothing more than a chance to embrace the Western values of liberty and justice in their own country. Controversially, I believe that if, under a future pro-Western government, Ukraine meets our economic standards, it should have the right to join the European Union. It might take a decade or more; but only that hope will spur change — and thwart the sinister ambitions of the brooding ogre in the Kremlin. For now, the Western nations seem powerless in Ukraine. Yet we could impose sanctions on Mr Yanukovych and his henchmen, many of whom run murky business empires at home while also swanning around in luxury and respectability in London. Investigations of their finances, and a ban on their families gaining visas to the West, would send a powerful signal. Ukrainians are fighting and dying for our values. But through our inaction, we are colluding with their oppressors.

Unqualified Michael Crane was doing 70mph in a residential area when he mounted the pavement and ploughed into Hye Jun Lee . A drink-driver has been jailed for 12 years for killing a young student as he sped through a city centre in his mother’s stolen sports car. Unqualified Michael Crane was doing 70mph in a residential area when he mounted the pavement and ploughed into Hye Jun Lee. The South Korean was hit with such force she was catapulted 20 yards through a brick wall and into a back garden. Crane, 31, left her dying at the scene in Cambridge after fleeing the scene and later denied any knowledge of the accident. Tests found he was one-and-a-half times over the limit and he had no driving licence or insurance. His 19-year-old victim had a promising future as a student at Cambridge University and dreamed of working for the United Nations. Judge Jonathan Haworth told Crane: 'In all my years of dealing with cases like this, this is one of the worst, if not the worst, this court has ever had to deal with. 'There is nothing this court can do to ever replace the loss of this life but it is my duty to ensure you are sufficiently punished for the way you behaved that night.' Cambridge Crown Court heard Crane was spotted driving at up to 70mph in a 30mph zone just moments before the crash last May. Miss Lee was walking back to her student accommodation when Crane hit her with his mother’s Mazda car which he had taken without her permission. Sara Walker, prosecuting, said he lost control, hit a kerb and mounted the pavement killing her instantly. She added: 'Investigations of his phone revealed incoming texts throughout the evening, including one seconds before the collision, that pointed to an ongoing domestic dispute that evening.'

'I felt really frightened to make this return journey as I didn’t have the heart to tell my remaining family that the ash in a square container was our beloved daughter, beloved older sister and beloved granddaughter.' Crane, from Cambridge, admitted causing death by dangerous driving, aggravated vehicle taking, drink-driving and having no licence or insurance. He was jailed for 10 years and given a further two years by the judge who said he believed he posed 'a serious risk of harm to the public.' Crane was also disqualified from driving for 12 years. PC Pete Bimson, accident investigator, said: 'Michael Crane’s actions were not only dangerous but the court has recognised that he poses a high risk to the public and that has been reflected in the sentence. 'This is clearly a very significant sentence although I am mindful that no sentence will make up for the loss of Hye Jun Lee to her family which is made all the more difficult by the fact her family lives so far away.'","Unqualified Michael Crane, 31, was doing 70mph in a residential area .

Ukol Talumpa, his wife Lea, 25-year-old relative Saripuddin Talumpa and toddler Philip Thomas Estuesta were attacked outside the busy Manila Ninoy Aquino International Airport  Friday morning as they awaited a ride from a family member. Four others were also injured.

Retired policeman John Davidson who has been accused of being corrupt during the time of the Stephen Lawrence murder, and has now been allegedly tied to the murder of a private investigator in 1987 . An allegedly corrupt officer who worked on the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation could be linked to an unsolved case concerning the killing of a private investigator. Former detective sergeant John Davidson was named as suspected of having corrupt links to the gangster father of one of the thugs who was ultimately convicted of Stephen's murder in Mark Ellison QC's review. Announcing the findings, Home Secretary Theresa May said Mr Ellison had established possible links between Mr Davidson and the investigation into the murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan. Mr Morgan was found with an axe in his head in a pub car park in south-east London on March 10, 1987, and remains one of Scotland Yard's longest unsolved murder case. Last year, Mrs May appointed an independent panel to look at 'police involvement in the murder' after Scotland Yard admitted corruption was a 'debilitating factor' in the original investigation. The Home Secretary said: 'Ellison also refers to possible links between an allegedly corrupt officer involved in the Stephen Lawrence case - DS Davidson - and the investigation into the murder of Daniel Morgan. 'Ellison finds that the Daniel Morgan Panel may therefore uncover material relevant to the question of corruption. And so it is key that the Daniel Morgan Panel continues its important work.' Daniel Morgan, Private detective. Morgan was killed in 1987 in a south London car park, but no-one has been brought to justice for one of the longest unsolved murder cases on Scotland Yard's books .

Murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence . Last summer, Mr Ellison's team was told the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel was at an early stage and a huge amount of material had not been indexed. In February this year, the Ellison review was told by Scotland Yard that there is no record of Mr Davidson being involved in the investigation into the murder of Mr Morgan. However, Mr Ellison said he had 'some reservations about accepting this assertion' in the absence of further consideration of the material held by the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel. He said: 'In any event, a number of the officers involved in the Daniel Morgan investigation can be linked to DS Davidson. 'We remain concerned that there is a real possibility that the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel may hold or acquire material of relevance to our review of the corruption issue.' After numerous separate police investigations into the Morgan case between 1987 and 2002, the Crown Prosecution Service discontinued the final attempted prosecution of five suspects in 2011.

Salesman Sean Hills, 36, was jailed for five-and-a-half months at Aberdeen Sheriff Court and disqualified from driving for six years after footage of him swerving all over the A90 near Stonehaven was posted on Facebook . A drink-driver was jailed yesterday after a sheriff spent ten minutes watching footage of his erratic driving posted on Facebook. Salesman Sean Hills was caught on camera by a motorist following him as he weaved and bumped his way along one of the busiest roads in the North-East of Scotland. The footage, which was later posted on the social networking site, showed his BMW 4x4 veering across the A90 near his home in Stonehaven. He then drove into the  Kincardineshire town itself, where he was stopped by a police patrol. Hills, 36, was jailed for five-and-a-half months at Aberdeen Sheriff Court and disqualified from driving for six years. It was the second time he had been caught drink-driving. In court yesterday, it had seemed that Hills might just avoid prison when Sheriff Christopher Shead initially agreed with Hills’s defence agent when he suggested a ‘substantial’ community  payback order might be an appropriate disposal. But the sheriff then decided to accept the Crown’s invitation to come off the bench and view the film for himself – after which he said jail was the only option. Hills was shaking violently and looked close to tears as the sheriff sent him down. Sheriff Shead told him: ‘In these cases, the court has to balance the factors that are favourable for you against the public interest – in this case, whether custodial sentences are appropriate.‘The court has reached the conclusion that they are.’ Hills was pulled over by police in Stonehaven on January 13, just minutes after a witness filmed him driving erratically on the Aberdeen to Dundee road.

Defence agent Gregor Kelly said: ‘He received a call to say she was on her way home and stupidly decided to drive back to Stonehaven. ‘His use of alcohol has significantly increased over the past two years. Over the past 12 months, he has found himself drinking up to 30 units per day. He sought help last year when he realised his alcohol use was soaring.’ On his return journey, Hills at one point struck with a verge near his hometown.

The dramatic amateur footage of his driving, shot by a passenger in the car behind, emerged on social media a few hours after the offence was committed. Hills turned off the A90 to go down the narrow Den of Logie entrance to Stonehaven where he was seen crossing double white lines in the middle of the road. He ended up near the busy town centre and was seen going up on the pavement – narrowly missing parked cars – before a police patrol car stopped him.

America's top doll, Barbie, finds herself in controversy once again, this time over a business partnership between her manufacturer, Mattel, and the Girl Scouts. On Thursday, two consumer advocacy groups often critical of corporate advertising tactics — the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and the Center for a New American Dream — criticized Barbie as a flawed role model for little girls and launched a petition drive urging the Girl Scouts of the USA to end the partnership. The Girls Scouts said they would not do so. Just a few weeks ago, Mattel incurred widespread criticism — as well as some accolades — for letting Barbie be featured in Sports Illustrated's annual swimsuit edition. Breakup: Girl Scouts of the USA's new relationship with the Barbie doll provides a bad role model according to an advocacy group . Complaint: Two advocacy groups often critical of corporate advertising tactics the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and the Center for a New American Dream have urged the Girl Scouts of USA to end its partnership with the doll's manufacturer, the Mattel toy company . Under fire: Girl Scouts have also been criticized for the production of this Girl Scout Daisy and Brownie Activity Booklet for kids to have fun completing the various activities . The Girl Scouts' partnership with Mattel, announced last August, includes a Barbie-themed activity book, a website, and a Barbie participation patch — the first Girl Scout uniform patch with corporate sponsorship. 'Holding Barbie, the quintessential fashion doll, up as a role model for Girl Scouts simultaneously sexualizes young girls, idealizes an impossible body type, and undermines the Girl Scouts' vital mission to build 'girls of courage, confidence and character,' said Susan Linn, director of the Boston-based commercial-free childhood organization. She said the Barbie patch — targeted at 5-to-8-year-old Daisies and Brownies — would transform these girls into 'walking advertisements.' 'This is product placement at its worst,' said New American Dream's executive director, Wendy Philleo, who described herself as a longtime admirer of the Girl Scouts. 'Our children are already being bombarded . by marketers' pitches at stores, at home, online, on TV, and in . school,' said Philleo, whose Charlottesville, Va.-based group tries to . counter the commercialization of American culture. The Girl Scouts' national headquarters in New York rejected the groups' appeal. 'Our partnership with Mattel focuses on career exploration and teaches girls about inspiring women in a fun way,' said spokeswoman Kelly Parisi. 'We stand behind this partnership, as it helps us bring to over 2 million Girl Scouts the message that they can do anything.' Patch up: The Girl Scouts¿ partnership with Mattel, announced last August, includes a Barbie-themed activity book, a website, and a Barbie participation patch ¿ the first Girl Scout uniform patch with corporate sponsorship . That's the essence of the Barbie uniform patch — a bright pink oval with a gold-letter slogan stitched on it: 'Be anything. Do everything.' Barbie — still slim-waisted and long-legged after 55 years — had pursued roughly 150 different careers, and she stretched her boundaries again in February by posing along with real-life supermodels in Sports Illustrated's 50th anniversary swimsuit issue. Anticipating the criticism that ensued, Mattel promoted the campaign with the catchword 'unapologetic.' In announcing the partnership with Mattel last year, Girl Scouts CEO Anna Maria Chavez depicted both her own organization and Barbie as 'American icons.' 'Together, we are teaching girls that their futures are wide open with possibilities,' Chavez said at the time. Parisi, in an e-mail Thursday, said Mattel gave the Girl Scouts $2 million to implement the Barbie-themed initiatives.  At the time the partnership was announced, the Girl Scouts were struggling financially, with revenue shortfalls prompting the national headquarters to trim about one-fourth of its staff through buyouts and layoffs. Objections: The specific patch that the consumer group objects to is the 'Be Anything, Do Everything' participation patch that allows Girl Scouts to explore career choices through an activity booklet that also has a Barbie tie-in . The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood said the Girl Scouts' Barbie-themed website included a game that would encourage girls to identify careers based on attire — 'from a veterinarian in a frilly miniskirt, to a pink-suited U.S. president, to a race car driver in stilettos.' Said Susan Linn, the campaign director: 'The website is little more than an interactive ad for Barbie promoting the brand's insidious message that women really are what they wear.' Linn said she communicated privately with the Girl Scouts last year, hoping they would end the Mattel partnership without the need for a public advocacy campaign, but those efforts failed. A psychologist who teaches at Harvard Medical School, Linn founded the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood in 2000. It now reports a membership of 54,000, many of them parents. Good match: Mattel executives say Barbie and Girl Scouts are a natural fit. 'Aligning with the Girl Scouts mission, Barbie has inspired girls' imaginations on their journey to self-discovery, allowing them to explore a world without limits' The group's advocacy campaigns have achieved numerous victories, notably in forcing several companies to halt or modify advertising claiming that certain videos and other products could help infants learn. It also has helped block proposed state laws that would have allowed advertising on school buses. The Center for a New American Dream, a nonprofit founded in 1997, says its mission is to help Americans reduce and modify the level of consumption ""to improve quality of life, protect the environment, and promote social justice."" Due to their size and high profile, the Girl Scouts have been a frequent target of criticism over the years, notably from certain conservatives who contend — despite the Girl Scouts' repeated denials — that the organization tilts toward the abortion-rights side of the national abortion debate. Last month, some anti-abortion groups launched a boycott of the Girl Scouts' annual drive to sell cookies.

Nigel Farage today boasted that Ukip is the main opposition in the north of England after coming second to Labour in a high-profile by-election. The Tories were pushed into third place behind the eurosceptic party, with the Lib Dems humiliated after losing their deposit. David Cameron sought to play down the significance of again being beaten by Ukip, but Mr Farage ailed 'really good solid, steady progress' against the mainstream parties. Thumb's up: Nigel Farage hailed the by-election result, which saw Ukip candidate John Bickley (left) come second ahead of the Tories, as proof his party is now the opposition in the north . Labour’s Mike Kane comfortably held . the safe seat of Wythenshawe and Sale East in the early hours of this . morning and become the party’s newest MP. But . Ukip, who trailed in fifth place at the 2010 General Election, saw . their strategy of targeting Labour seats in the North of England pay off . – with a Conservative collapse and humiliation for the Lib Dems. The anti-EU party’s candidate was John . Bickley, a businessman who grew up in the area in a staunchly Labour . household. He said the . result showed the progress Ukip were making, telling Sky News: 'In the . north of England we're shaping up to be the only opposition to Labour.' A Ukip battle bus parked on a taxi rank was given a parking ticket  in outside the by-election count . Manchester City Council's former parking chief Nigel Murphy said: 'We recommend to all people not to park in taxi ranks. We look forward to receive their payment' Mr Bickley's campaign focused on concerns about immigration, the EU . and rising green taxes on energy bills, but leaflets also highlighted . ‘Labour’s millionaires’. Ukip leader Nigel . Farage had complained the campaign had been 'as dirty as they come'. Labour . were the clear winners with 13,261 votes. Ukip pulled in 4,301 compared . with the Tories' 3,479. The Lib Dem candidate Mary Di Mauro managed . only 1,176 and refused to talk to the media. The by-election was triggered by the sudden death of popular Labour MP Paul Goggins MP, who collapsed while . out jogging last month, aged 60. Labour . has held the seat for 17 years since it was created and the late Mr . Goggins took 58 per cent of the vote at the last election, with the . Conservatives in second place on 25 per cent. The by-election was triggered by the  sudden death of popular Labour MP Paul Goggins MP, who collapsed while out jogging last month, aged 60 . Both . the Conservatives and Ukip had thrown resources at the campaign, with . Treasury minister Sajid Javed and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling among . the MPs who travelled there to campaign for their contender, . politically-unknown vicar  Daniel Critchlow, 26. Ukip's . previous best result was gaining 27.8 per cent of the vote in the . Eastleigh by-election last March, coming a close second to the Lib Dems . in the contest following the resignation of disgraced former minister . Chris Huhne. Labour won the Wythenshawe and Sale East parliamentary by-election today while the Conservatives were pushed into third place by Ukip and Lib Dem support was decimated. Former councillor Mike Kane held the seat for the party, polling 13,261 votes. The party's success and the demise of the Tory vote is yet another by-election blow to Prime Minister David Cameron. But the Liberal Democrats were dealt a humiliating blow when they polled just 1,176 votes - not enough to hold their deposit. The by-election was brought about by the sudden death of the serving MP, Paul Goggins, on January 7, at 60. In his victory speech, Mr Kane said voters had 'sent a very clear message' to the Government. 'They have rejected the failed policies of the out-of-touch Tories, they have rejected the isolationism and scaremongering of Ukip. 'It's a result which emphatically demonstrates that people here know the NHS is not safe in David Cameron's hands, and that we've had enough of his utterly out-of-touch government.' On the subject of vote retention, Nigel Farage said his party's performance in increasing its share of the vote represented 'really good progress' in the North and said that only the lightning timetable set for the campaign by Labour, and a turn out of just 28 per-cent, had prevented it doing even better. ‘We are picking up votes in the North of England, and we are getting most of them from the Labour Party,’ the Ukip leadersaid. ‘Our message is this – open-door immigration has hit Labour voters and lower tax payers more than any other part of our society. ‘Link that with the fact that Old Labour does not like being governed from  Brussels and that is why we are picking up votes in the North.’ The Prime Minister described the Conservative result – in which its share of the vote was almost halved to 14.5 per cent – as ‘disappointing’. But he suggested that Ukip’s momentum had stalled, after a number of by-elections in which the party polled more than 20 per cent.Labour dismissed suggestions it was losing votes to Ukip. Mr Kane said voters had ‘rejected the failed policies of the out-of-touch Tories’, as well as the ‘isolationism and scaremongering of Ukip’.But senior Labour figures acknowledge privately that Ukip is making inroads into the working-class vote. ‘Until recently I was encouraging people to vote Ukip because I knew it would hurt the Conservatives,’ said one. ‘Not any more. They are taking votes off us in significant numbers and, unless we promise a referendum on the EU, they will continue to do so.’ Mr Miliband said the Tories should be ‘deeply concerned’ by the collapse of their vote at a time when the economy is showing signs of recovery. Lib Dem president Tim Farron described the party’s performance, where it polled just 1,176 votes and lost its deposit, as ‘very disappointing’. ‘The reality is in by-elections in the past the Liberal Democrats were often the “None of the Above Party”. The reality is now that we’re one of the above,’ he said. Professor John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University . British politics looks like a stalemate at the moment. Labour is ahead in the polls, but not by enough to be confident of victory in 2015. The Tories are still trying to find the favourable political wind they hope economic recovery will bring. The Liberal Democrats remain in the deep black hole they have occupied ever since they supported £9,000 tuition fees, while after their dramatic rise in the polls earlier last year, Ukip appear to be doing little more than treading water. The Wythenshawe result confirmed this picture. There was one big loser – the Lib Dems – while nobody else could be wholly satisfied with their achievement. True, Labour not only won the seat but also increased its share of the vote by 11 percentage points – almost twice its average rise in all previous by-elections since 2010. However, at 55 per cent its share was still lower than the Labour vote locally in 2001. That does not give the impression of a party well set to grab power next year. The Conservative performance was almost a mirror image of Labour’s – its vote fell by 11 points. The drop matches almost exactly the party’s average performance in by-elections in the past 18 months. There is no sign here of any  recovery in Tory fortunes. Eighteen months ago, Ukip’s 18 per cent share would have been regarded as remarkable. That today it might even be thought of as a bit of a disappointment – the party secured more than 20 per cent in the previous three by-elections – is testament to how far it has come in a short time. Even so, the result is a reminder that although the party may be capable of overtaking the Tories in Labour territory, it remains a long way from being able to threaten Labour’s tenure in such seats. The party complained that because many voters now post their ballot papers long before polling day it is more difficult for it to profit from any last-minute surge it generates. But that did not stop Ukip winning the equivalent of 25 per cent of the national vote in the local elections last May and seems unlikely to obstruct whatever progress it manages to make in the Euro elections this coming May. Whatever disappointment Nigel Farage might have felt would, however, have been nothing like the pain that Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg must have experienced.

Japanese mobsters' links with big business are currently under scrutiny after it emerged that some banks were lending money to gangsters, or 'yakuza'. File picture . The seedy links between Japanese mobsters - the dreaded yakuza - and the bankers who loan them millions have been laid bare as the nation's government cracks down on organised crime. Japan is engulfed in its worst mob scandal in years and it's shining a rare light on the links between big business and shadowy organised crime groups usually known for street-level ventures like extortion and loan sharking. But with membership falling as police crack down ever harder, experts say the yakuza are branching far outside their traditional areas into everything from insider trading to funding business startups. The crackdown at home has intensified . after Mizuho Bank said in September that it had loaned money to . organised crime members, an admission subsequently repeated by at least . four other major lenders including Japan's biggest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ . Financial Group. 'Insider trading has become huge - you can make much more money manipulating stocks than extorting businesses', says Jake Adelstein, a crime writer whose bestselling memoir 'Tokyo Vice' is set to become a Hollywood movie. Adelstein, a former reporter at Japan's top-selling Yomiuri daily, likens the Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan's biggest organised crime group, to 'Goldman Sachs with guns'. Many mobsters -famous for their elaborate full-body tattoos and lopped-off little fingers - have now ditched their street tough personas in favour of tailored suits and a clean-cut look that would not look out of place in any boardroom, Adelstein said. 'They're savvy investors,' he said added. 'They like to gamble.' The yakuza occupy a grey area in Japan's usually law-abiding society. Much like the Mafia, they are both feared and loathed as social outcasts, while also being revered in equal measure through film, fanzines and manga cartoons. They engage in activities ranging from gambling, drugs, and prostitution to loan sharking, protection rackets and other illegal ventures, often run through front companies. But unlike their foreign counterparts, yakuza are legal groups with offices in major Japanese cities, and they have historically been tolerated by authorities, although there are periodic clampdowns. In fact, the Yamaguchi-gumi helped dole out food after a major quake in the western city of Kobe in 1995. Jake Adelstein, a former Yomiuri Shimbun daily crime reporter and an expert on the yakuza, says the mobsters are heavily involved in the business world . But Tokyo is now under intense pressure from abroad to clamp down on yakuza and their money laundering, as the U.S. Treasury Department works to freeze the overseas assets of top Japanese crime groups which it says make 'billions of dollars annually in illicit proceeds'. Sometimes loans were legitimately used by gangsters to buy foreign sports cars or other expensive items, while in other cases the vehicle was quickly sold on the black market with the loan never paid back. The scandal at Mizuho worsened after it initially said top executives knew nothing about the loans, only to backtrack on that claim as a company-commissioned report emerged that blasted its laissez-faire compliance. Mizuho later said more than 50 executives would be punished, with its chief executive forfeiting six months pay. But the latest admissions are not a first for the country's banks, a big source of concern among police wary of sharing details of investigations with mob-linked firms, experts say. Shibuya in Tokyo, a major business and entertainment district. Yakuza are moving into investment and legitimate businesses as a response to a police crackdown on organised crime . 'It is baffling that Mizuho board members failed to act,' said Toshihiko Kubo, professor of financial law at Ritsumeikan University. 'Once they learned that loan recipients were related to the mob, they should have taken immediate action.' Major lenders are routinely approached by those with links to organised crime looking to raise money, said an anti-yakuza campaigner in Tokyo, echoing calls from Finance Minister Taro Aso, among others, to tighten banking rules. 'Crime syndicates... are out to make money, and they'll use whatever means available,' said the campaigner, who asked not to be identified. 'Many companies are trying not to deal with organised crime... But It's difficult to filter everything because their methods are also becoming sophisticated.' Earlier this year, the Japan Securities Dealers Association launched a database to help keep those with mob links out of the country's stock market. Ink: Yakuza are known for their elaborate body art. File picture . The pressure on Tokyo to clean up the problem is set to intensify as Japan looks to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. On paper, the crackdown appears headed in the right direction with yakuza membership down by about 28 per cent to 63,000 in 2012 from a decade ago, according to police data. Still, yakuza links run deep in Japan and some observers say their tough enforcement keeps street crime low. Their place is so deeply rooted that senior politicians are sometimes found to have mob ties, including ex-Justice Minister Keishu Tanaka who resigned last year following reports of his association with mobsters. 'There are lots of politicians that, in some sense, owe their positions to yakuza support back in old days, so clearly their influence is not non-existent,' Adelstein says. 'It's still a bizarre system because Japan's organised crime groups are legal entities. They are regulated but not banned.'","The feared yakuza are moving into more legitimate enterprises .

A couple has been stoned to death for adultery in a remote southwest region of Pakistan on the orders of an Islamic cleric. Daraz Khan, 25, and Hayat Bibi, 27, were killed by a mob led by Mrs Bibi’s husband in the Loralai district in Balochistan. Ms Bibi went into hiding a week ago when the alleged affair was discovered, but then came forward when she heard that the mob had captured Mr Khan, locals reported. A couple was stoned to death in Pakistan after they allegedly had an affair. Stoning is legal in the country with permission of the courts, though in this instance the stoning occurred illegally . She was forced to watch the mob stone Mr Khan to death before they turned on her. The mob, led by her husband and brothers, then threw rocks and bricks at her until she died. Ms Bibi’s husband had approached a local cleric demanding the couple should be stoned to death in compliance with Shariah law, reported The Times. Stoning is legal in Pakistan, but only if the sentence is passed by a federal or provincial court, which did not happen in this case where the death was sanctioned only by tribal elders. No one has ever legally been stoned to death in Pakistan. Ms Bibi’s husband, the cleric, and four others have been arrested and the bodies of the couple are being exhumed today to prove they were stoned to death. ‘It is a shameful act and the people involved in stoning the man and the woman will be brought to justice,’ said Sarfaraz Bugti, the home minister for Baluchistan. In Pakistan, a conviction for murder can carry the death sentence, but despite Mr Bugti’s outrage, it is widely expected that no action will be taken against the six men . Police rarely intervene in cases such as this one and the federal courts have little authority in remote regions of the country, including Balochistan, meaning that it is often left to local tribal and religious leaders to mete out punishments, which are usually harsher than the law allows. The stoning occurred in the Baluchistan region of southwest Pakistan, by a mob led by the woman's husband and brothers . Even if cases of so-called ‘honour killings’ are brought to court, they often take years to be heard. The national conviction rate is between 5 and 10 percent. If someone is convicted, the victim's family can forgive the killers, which is a major loophole considering the killers are often members of the victim’s family. Two other couples accused of adultery have been killed in Loralai district in the last two months. ‘Honour killings’ for adultery are not uncommon in Pakistan, but stonings are rare. Last year a young mother of two, Afridi Bibi, no relation to Hayat Bibi, was stoned to death by a mob led by her uncle for carrying a mobile phone in Punjab province of Pakistan. The death sparked fears that stoning might be on the rise in certain countries, including Pakistan and Afghanistan. The practice of stoning is legal in 15 Muslim countries and is set out as a specific punishment for adultery under several interpretations of Sharia law. Its supporters say stoning is legitimised by the Hadith – the deeds and saying of the Prophet Muhammad – though there is no mention of the practice in the Koran.","Hayat Bibi, 27, and Daraz Khan, 25, stoned to death in Balochistan .

A gypsy couple have been ordered to demolish the £250,000 home they have lived in for eight years, because it is 18 inches too wide. Rodney Wilson and partner Pat Wenn moved onto the land in Walsoken, Norfolk in 2006 but ignored the local planning laws which outlines a ban to build on the site. In 2011 - after an appeal  - they were eventually granted permission to have two mobile homes which they knocked into a single property, complete with conservatory. A gypsy couple have been ordered to demolish the £250,000 home they have lived in for eight years, because it is 18 inches too wide . But they found themselves in another battle with West Norfolk Borough Council when it emerged their double park home - which has a front garden and an ornamental pond - was too big and didn't adhere to the planning proposal. Mr Wilson, 70, said the battle has already cost him £30,000 in planning fees and it would cost him another £38,000 to reduce the size of the property in which he and his partner were planning to retire in. It comes after planners said the two mobile units joined together were 24ft wide instead of the maximum 22ft 3ins permitted under rules governing caravan sites. Mr  Wilson, and his partner, 75, were refused permission to keep the existing home on the site as the council voted for 'direct action' to remove it in 2012. The 'mobile home' structure is on a plot of rectangular land, settled back from the road. Planners said the two mobile units joined together were 24ft wide instead of the maximum 22ft 3ins permitted under rules governing caravan sites. The plot also has a pond and a front garden . The couple appealed but a High Court judge has now lifted an injunction stopping the council from getting rid of the property under the original enforcement notice of 2006. A report to a recent planning committee meeting said: 'Implementation and execution of direct action to comply with part of the enforcement notice, the removal of the unauthorised park home, will now be carried out to remedy the ongoing breach of planning control.' Mr Wilson said: 'All I want to do is live here and retire here. That's all I'm asking. 'It's cost me £30,000 in solicitor's fees so far and I'm not finished yet.' He has estimated it would cost him £38,000 to reduce the width of the property. In 2006, the council refused to accept that the mobile unit was a 'caravan' because it did not pass the necessary mobility tests. Council chiefs also did no believe that Mr Wilson was a gypsy at he beginning of the planning process - so the planning decision was not assessed in accordance with gypsy sites. However, after hearing additional information about his formerly 'nomadic life' - which he lived until he decided to settle down and cease travelling - they accepted his status and gave permission for him to build a 'mobile home for persons of gypsy status'.","Rodney Wilson and Pat Wenn moved onto land in Walsoken, Norfolk in 2006 .

Arrested: Branko Bogdanov has been detained alongside his wife and daughter over an alleged $7 million shoplifting scheme . A father, mother and daughter from a posh Chicago suburb stole $7 million in merchandise during a decadelong shoplifting spree — traveling to stores nationwide and targeting dolls, toys, cosmetics and other valuables — according to a federal complaint released Wednesday. The three were arrested earlier this week at their $1.3 million Northbrook home after returning from a three-day trip through Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana, where authorities say they shoplifted from stores. Working in tandem, the family traveled from their Chicago-area residence to hit businesses in multiple states, including Maryland, Tennessee and Florida, according to the 20-page complaint. Branko Bogdanov, 58, Lela Bogdanov, 52, and their 34-year-old daughter, Julia Bogdanov, are charged with one count each of interstate transportation of stolen property. They made initial appearances Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Chicago, but did not enter pleas; they'll be held at least until a detention hearing next week. Someone who answered a phone at their Northbrook residence declined any comment . Lela Bogdanov frequently donned a long black skirt with large compartments sewn on the inside during the alleged shoplifting binges and was caught on surveillance cameras leaving some stores with her skirt looking notably fuller than when she entered, the complaint says. Standing in orange jail clothes Wednesday in federal court, Lela Bogdanov wiped away tears as U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Mason explained her rights. She followed the proceedings through a Romani interpreter. Lela Bogdanov, 52, confers with lawyer in court . Branko Bogdanov, 58 (second left), and daughter Julia Bogdanov, 34 (also in orange), stand before a judge as they face their charges . An unnamed cooperating witness bought many of the stolen items — which included everything from American Girl dolls and Furby robotic toys to coffee and steak knives — at the Bogdanov home, then sold them online through eBay, the complaint says. On their own, Bogdanovs directly sold more than $690,000 in merchandise through eBay, the complaint says, making about $4million total from their loot. The United States Secret Service led the investigation after Barnes and Noble Inc. and Toys R Us Inc. contacted the agency about what the complaint describes as 'a huge loss in merchandise'. With the help of those companies and eBay, authorities traced stolen items to an the online trading account of the cooperating witnesses, who, in turn, agreed to help in the investigation of the Bogdanovs. Ill-gotten gains? The family's $1.3 million Chicago home was allegedly funded by their epic crime spree . Sold online: The family allegedly sold items they stole over the internet on sites such as ebay . Speaking to reporters later Wednesday, the head of the Secret Service office in Chicago, Frank P. Benedetto, said large-scale shoplifting ultimately hurts both stores and their consumers. 'If this type of crime continues unchecked, the costs ... will be passed from the retailer to the common shopper,' he said. A conviction on the one count of interstate transportation of stolen property carries sentence of up to 10 years. And this isn't the first time a member of the Bogdanov family is facing jail time for stealing. According to public records, father Branko has a previous theft conviction from Georgia in 1989, and was convicted of burglary in Texas in 1977. Mother Lela was a criminal history in Pennsylvania, and plead guilty to charges of engaging in a criminal conspiracy, receiving stolen property and retail theft in December 200.

Members of Spirit of Shankly (SOS), a 'supporters' union', claim their human rights were violated during the four-hour journey from a match against Sunderland. The fans, including disabled supporters and mothers with young children, say they were not allowed to go to the toilet at motorway service stations because the officers escorting their coaches would not let them off. Fans: Liverpool supporters claim they were trapped on coaches as they returned home from a game against Sunderland in March 2011, pictured . SOS is launching legal claims against Durham, North Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, and Greater Manchester police forces over the incident in March 2011, which involved 500 fans travelling on 12 coaches. 'The mood of most people on the coach was very irate,' said SOS committee member Roy Bentham. 'There were kids and women who couldn't use the facilities and the toilets were blocked. 'A lot of people were thirsty and dehydrating. It was quite a warm day. There were kids who were crying. We had a disabled lad on the coach and he needed the toilet and it was horrendous. 'We are [talking about] a seven-figure sum settlement and that's before the legal costs. The claim will go forward on wrongful imprisonment because the police's actions on that day were not proportionate and were unreasonable, and they were heavy-handed.' Mr Bentham said he expected proceedings to start in court later this year. Anger: Roy Bentham, pictured, says the fans had their human rights breached by their treatment . Disabled fan Chris McNulty said he felt 'humiliated' by the ordeal of being confined to the coach, and had since shunned the transport. Other supporters said they were banned from getting off at one of the vehicle's scheduled stops. Mark Milsom, of West Yorkshire Police, said: 'The force received a letter in September 2013 representing supporters who attended the Sunderland vs Liverpool fixture in March 2011. 'Our legal department replied to the letter repudiating any legal claim, and we have had no further correspondence on the matter.'

The Ukip leader said women were ‘slowly but surely taking . over’ his party – and that after the European elections there will be as many . high-profile Ukip women as men. He said this had been achieved despite the party not . engaging in positive discrimination; a policy which he described as . ‘demeaning’. Mr Farage also said the country needed an ‘honest debate’ about our maternity laws which he said were placing a huge burden on small . businesses. He was interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour a day after . Ukip came second in the Wythenshawe and Sale East by election – pushing the . Conservatives into third place. Critics say the party has an image problem with women . because of comments by senior figures such as Godfrey Bloom, who described . women as ‘sluts’ last autumn. In addition, most of the party’s top team are male, but Mr . Farage insisted that was changing. ‘Ukip in the early days was very male dominated, and also . amongst the voters far more men voted for us than women,’ he said. ‘We saw a change in that begin to happen last year. I think . the reason for that was the three big by-election advances that we made – . Corby, Rotherham, Eastleigh – all female candidates. ‘We’ve just completed our selections for the European . elections and the women have done amazingly well. In fact there are some saying . that women are about to take Ukip over. ‘From May 22 this year, post the European elections, there . are going to be, among our top line people, as many women as men – and that’s . not happened with positive discrimination, it’s happened because our members . have judged they are the right people.’ He praised Thatcherism its belief in meritocracy on gender . and class; contrasting it with Labour and the Tories’ belief in positive . discrimination. ‘There’s a huge debate in politics,’ he said. ‘Is positive . discrimination the way forward? Or do we just say: We don’t care whether people . are black or white, male or female – we let them get on according to their . ability. That’s the view that we’ve taken in UKIP. ‘That is going to be at forefront of the national debate for . years to come, because we have European rules on the percentage of women that . have to be in the boardroom. ‘So we’re moving down the road of positive discrimination to . create a fairer society and I’m not sure it works.’ Mrl Farage, pictured meeting locals on the flooded Somerset Levels, warned that positive discrimination towards women is 'demeaning' Pointing out that Ukip women often appear on Question Time, . he added:  ‘The women are slowly but surely taking over Ukip, they’re . going to dominate the election coverage. We believe in a meritocracy, we think . that positive discrimination is demeaning.’ Mr Farage was asked about comments by former Ukip member . Marta Andreasen that: ‘Nigel does not like women… He thinks women should be in . the kitchen or in the bedroom.’ He replied: ‘Nobody but nobody has taken that seriously . because they all know it’s not true. Nobody has done more to promote women in . UKIP than I’ve done, not through positive discrimination. ‘When people get kicked out of political parties they tend . to be very bitter and very upset and say all sorts of things. But she got it . wrong and that’s why it’s never stuck.’ The MEP said: ‘When you get the results from the European . elections, you’ll be astonished to see as many women as men in the top slots in . UKIP – things have changed.’ UKIP has been campaigning this week for Britain’s foreign . aid budget to be diverted towards flood relief in southern England. Mr Farage told Woman’s Hour that the policy is playing . better with women than men, ‘because I think that women actually do tend to be . people that think very much about the family, and about budgets – men tend to . be rather more irresponsible on these issues in many households.’ He defended his comments that women who have children are . ‘worth less’ to their City employers, saying he was only talking about the . financial sector. ‘If a woman is a doctor, a dentist, a lawyer, then having . time off to have children makes absolutely no difference to her career . advancement at all,’ he said. Ukip has been dogged by allegations of sexism since former Godfrey Bloom, who later quit, described a roomful of female supporters as 'sluts' But he said maternity laws put too much burden on small . businesses. ‘That is something we’ve got to talk about and debate . honestly,’ he said. ‘On the one hand we want women to have every opportunity to . go into the workplace, but on the other we have to allow our small businesses . to survive.’ Mr Farage also defended former UKIP member Godfrey Bloom, . who said an employer would have to have their ‘head examined’ if they wanted to . employ a woman of childbearing age. He said that the likes of Alan Sugar and India Knight agreed . with the comments, which were worded badly. ‘What he was saying was legislation that was put in place to . protect women in the workplace is now in a sense discriminating against them . getting a job in the first place,’ he said. ‘A lot of people now agree that the essence of what he said . was right, but the way he expressed it perhaps upset people.’","Ukip leader claims women are 'slowly but surely taking over' party .

Bruising: Miss Livingstone suffered painful injuries as a result of her fall . Seconds before, Henry, who had recently emerged from an off-licence, started shouting and swearing at the group before angrily barging past. After the assault, she continued to school and picked up her children Lillie, five, and Ella, seven, before calling police. Attacker: Telicia Henry, pictured, pleaded guilty to common assault . The pain from the injuries gave Miss Livingstone sleepless nights and has made her nervous of going outside, a court heard. Officers arrested Henry, of no fixed abode, who later appeared at Bournemouth Magistrates’ Court where she pleaded guilty to common assault and received a six-week suspended prison sentence. Mark Price, defending, said: 'When this offence happened she was faced with a crowd of mothers and pushchairs and couldn’t get past. 'So she forced her way through forcefully - it wasn’t a reckless assault.' In a statement read to the court, Miss Livingstone said the assault left her unable to sleep for three nights because of the pain and she lost her confidence when out walking. Henry was told: 'This offence was committed in a group of ladies with children around. 'The abusive language you used was totally unacceptable and resulted in the lady being totally and utterly intimidated.' After the case Miss Livingstone, a part-time shop assistant, said: 'I was with some other mums and we had seen the woman go into an off-licence. 'We had about 20 minutes until we had to pick up the children from school. 'Then the woman came down the road and approached us. She elbowed me so hard that I fell over. 'I was in absolute shock, she could have easily avoided me but she knew what she wanted to do. 'I went to collect my children from school and when I got there I burst out crying and had a cup of tea with one of the teachers who called the police. 'The next day I went to hospital and discovered I had severe whiplash and a chipped bone in my shoulder. My arm was in a sling for two weeks because of it.'

Fulham's slim hopes of Barclays Premier League survival have been dealt a hefty double blow after Damien Duff was ruled out for the season and Scott Parker broke down with a knee injury. Manager Felix Magath also raised significant questions yesterday over whether Lewis Holtby is enough of a 'fighter' for Fulham's relegation battle and indicated that record signing Kostas Mitroglou injured his hamstring on international duty with Greece. The mystery of when the £12million Greek will be deemed ready continues, with Magath claiming he 'needs time to adapt' to the Premier League. Out: Fulham winger Damien Duff will miss the rest of the season through injury . Big job: Fulham manager Felix Magath has a huge task if he is to save Fulham from relegation . Ice man: Andre Schurrle showed his composure in front of goal at Craven Cottage with a hat-trick . With a trip to relegation rivals Cardiff on Saturday, the timing of the latest set-backs could not be worse for Fulham. Yet Magath insisted that he is 'convinced' the bottom-placed club can stay up. They will have to do so with Duff, who Magath revealed is set to miss the rest of the season with a knee injury that 'maybe' will need surgery. Parker has also been ruled out after injuring his knee in training on Wednesday, while Magath insinuated that Holtby, who was left on the bench in last weekend's defeat against Chelsea, lacks the defensive qualities that his struggling side needs. Another blow: Scott Parker will also miss the crunch clash against Cardiff City this weekend . Ready? Kostas Mitroglou will be looking to make an impact when the record signing is back fit . Magath said: 'I can only repeat that now is not the time to play very well, now is the time to fight. Holtby is not a fighter. He is very smart, skilful, offensive player with very good passes. 'The game against Chelsea, the best team in the league, we did not have much space to create chances and therefore he was out for that game.

Veteran Labour politician Tony Benn has left hospital and is being cared for at home, his family has said. The former cabinet minister, 88, was admitted to Charing Cross Hospital at the beginning of last month after feeling unwell. A family spokesman said: ‘Tony Benn has been moved from hospital and is now being cared for at home. Tony Benn has left hospital after being admitted last month and is being cared for at home, his family said . ‘The Benn family would like to express its heartfelt thanks to all the NHS staff at Charing Cross Hospital for their outstanding care, and to the many people who have sent kind messages of concern and support.’ Mr Benn entered parliament in November 1950 and served in the cabinet under Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan. He campaigned against EU membership, oversaw the development of Concorde, narrowly missed out on election as Labour deputy leader in 1981, and was instrumental in the party's 1983 manifesto. He stepped down from parliament in 2001, but remains a significant figure in the Labour movement - in particular as a staunch opponent of the Iraq War. Mr Benn (pictured here in 1984) entered parliament in November 1950 and served in the cabinet under Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan . A family statement thanked all 'NHS staff at Charing Cross Hospital (pictured) for their outstanding care' Last year Mr Benn revealed he did not . fear his demise after suffering a stroke, explaining that losing his . beloved American wife Caroline to cancer 14 years ago had helped him . cope. He said: ‘I’m not . frightened about death. I don’t know why, but I just feel at a certain . moment your switch is switched off and that’s it. And you can’t do . anything about it.’ His father, William Wedgwood Benn, was a Liberal MP, a Labour Minister and later made a peer. This photograph shows Tony Benn in 1962 . Born in 1925, Tony Benn entered politics in November 1950 as Labour representative for Bristol South East. He became the youngest MP in parliament. Mr Benn was born into a political family, with his father and two grandfathers all serving as MPs. Before entering politics, he served in the RAF during World War Two and studied at Oxford University. Mr Benn’s father, William Wedgwood Benn, accepted a peerage in 1942 and was created Viscount Stansgate. This meant that when he died in 1960, Tony Benn inherited his father's peerage and was disbarred from the House of Commons. He campaigned for a change and eventually retook his seat in Bristol South East in 1963. Mr Benn served as a cabinet minister under the governments of both Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan during his time in parliament. In the 1970s, he took on who he perceived as the Right-wing of the Labour leadership, campaigning for the party to take up socialist values. And, in 1983, he was a key component of Labour's election manifesto, dubbed 'the longest suicide note in history', which saw the Tories whitewashed in a battle with Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives. The Tory party remained in power until 1997. Mr Benn retired from the Commons in 2001 after 51 years as a Labour MP. He has remained politically active in recent years, in particular setting himself up as a staunch opponent of the Iraq War.

Scotland's flagship financial institutions could be forced by European law to become English if Scots vote to leave the UK, as big business lines up against independence. Oil giant Shell last night became the biggest corporate big name so far to warn against Scotland going it alone, joining the likes of Lloyds, Barclays and Standard Life in raising the alarm about the break up of the UK. It comes as an EU directive warns Scottish registered RBS and Lloyds would have to be redesignated as English because they would have their headquarters in London and do most of their business south of the Border. EU rules mean Scottish registered RBS and Lloyds would have to be redesignated as English . Banks and major financial institutions cannot be registered in a different country from their official headquarters. While RBS and Lloyds are both registered in Edinburgh at present, that will have to change if Scotland becomes independent, potentially costing thousands of jobs. The implications of the EU directive emerged as Lloyds, Britain's largest retail bank, warned yesterday that independence would send costs soaring for customers. Its annual report states: 'The impact of a Yes vote in favour of Scottish independence is uncertain. The outcome could have a material impact on compliance costs, the tax position, and cost of funding for the group.' It is the latest blow to Alex Salmond's separation plans and comes as flagship firms are lining up to quit the country in the event of a Yes vote. More...

Migrants DO cost UK jobs says 'buried' report: BBC attacked after claiming document was suppressed by No 10 . Last night, former Chancellor Alistair Darling, head of the Better Together campaign, said: 'Today we have seen even more uncertainty emerge regarding what would happen if we vote to leave the UK. 'Firstly Lloyds, a major employer here in Scotland, talked about the impact that going it alone would have on its business. 'Now we see there is a threat that EU Law would require some of our biggest institutions to leave the country in order to be where their main customer base is. 'With every passing day, more risks are coming to the surface. These are all risks that we do not need to face. If we want to avoid them, if we want to protect Scottish jobs, then we have to vote to stay in the UK.' First Minister Alex Salmond's plans for independence has suffered a blow as businesses including Shell raise concerns about its impact . Shell oil last night became the latest major UK business to oppose Scottish independence. Ben van Beurden, chief executive of the Anglo-Dutch oil firm, warned of the economic risks of Scotland voting in favour of independence. Mr van Beurden said: ‘We’d like to see Scotland remain part of the United Kingdom. ‘Shell has a long history of involvement in the North Sea – and therefore in Scotland – and we have continued to invest heavily there.’ Royal Dutch Shell, which has its headquarters in Britain, is the UK’s most valuable company. In a speech to a reception in London last night, Mr Van Burden said that one of the many things his company values about the UK ‘is the continuity and stability it offers’. Given a choice, we want to know as accurately as possible what investment conditions will look like 10 or 20 years from now,’ he added. Mr Van Burden likened Scotland’s place in the UK to the UK’s place in the European Union – which he also supports – saying it all boils down to economic competitiveness. The FTSE 100 firm joined the likes of Lloyds TSB and Barclays, which have also spoken out against Scotland becoming independent. Lloyds and Barclays both yesterday cited concerns about Scottish independence in their annual reports. Lloyds - which has its registered headquarters in Edinburgh - said it had concerns over a potential compliance costs and funding in the event of a ‘yes’ vote at the referendum. It said: ‘The impact of a yes vote in favour of Scottish independence is uncertain.’ But it added that: ‘the outcome could have a ‘material impact on compliance costs, the tax position and funding for the group’. The Deputy Prime Minister will also hit out at the ‘myths’ being peddled by ‘isolationists’ about the EU. Although BCCI was based in London, it was registered in Luxembourg - where the regulator was too small to monitor the bank properly before it collapsed. The EU directive was a safeguard introduced after the BBCI banking collapse in 1995. The warning from Lloyds follows last week's announcement by pensions giant Standard Life that it has plans to relocate to England if the country backs separation, putting more than 5,000 jobs at risk. Scotland's largest company RBS also raised fears over a referendum Yes vote as big business firmly came out in support of the Union. Yesterday other major Scottish based financial giants, including Scottish Equitable, Tesco Bank, Sainsbury's Bank and Scottish Widows - supporting around 20,000 jobs between them - confirmed they were closely following the independence debate and pointedly kept their options open. Lloyds employs more than 18,000 people in Scotland and is headquartered at the historic home of Bank of Scotland on the Mound in Edinburgh. Any decision to leave would be hugely symbolic as well as raising the fear of job losses. If RBS - Scotland's largest company - headed south, it could result in the loss of 3,200 Scots jobs. Standard Life has said it is worried about a number of 'material issues', such as the currency that will be used in Scotland, membership of the European Union and personal taxes. It has now started work to establish additional registered companies to operate outside Scotland, into which it could transfer parts of its business. Standard Life's chief executive David Nish said: 'We will continue to seek clarity on these matters but uncertainty is likely to remain. In view of this, there are steps we will take based on our analysis of the risks.' Last night, Scottish Conservative finance spokesman Gavin Brown 'A clear pattern is now emerging, with increasing numbers of financial service companies having serious concerns about the uncertainty caused by the referendum. 'While the European directive is unclear, were it to be the case that head offices did need to move south of the Border, this would present a risk to a considerable number of jobs in Scotland.' A UK Treasury spokesman said: 'Lloyds have now joined RBS and Standard Life in reasonably and fairly pointing out the risks and costs that arise from independence. 'This uncertainty is being made worse by the Scottish Government's failure to set out a plan for what currency it would use in the event of independence. 'These interventions from business show the strength and stability of the UK is the essential underpinning of Scotland's successful financial services sector over several centuries. It's common sense to stick with something that works.' Finance Secretary John Swinney said: 'Scotland has a strong and diverse economy and the point of independence is to win the powers we need to build on those strengths. 'Lloyd's Banking Group's comments show exactly why our proposals for a formal currency area are the right proposals, why they are in the best interests of business on both sides of the Border and why that is what will be implemented by both governments.' Last week Edinburgh-based insurance giant Standard Life said it might move some of its operations outside of Scotland in the event of independence.","EU rules target banks with London HQ and business south of the border .

A Texas school district settled out of court this week with a former student who sued after a coach revealed her sexual orientation to her mother against her will. Skye Wyatt, now 21, received a $77,500 settlement from the Kilgore Independent School District after a 2009 incident in which she was booted off the school softball team and the coach told her mother she was gay. Wyatt sued claiming breach of her constitutional right to privacy and violation of state law, as well as emotional stress from a ‘destroyed’ relationship with her mother, according to the Longview News-Journal. The school maintains it did nothing wrong despite the payout. Settled: Skye Wyatt, now 21, accepted a $77,500 settlement after a coach outed her a lesbian to her mother when she was only 16-years-old . The former softball player claimed in the suit a coach Rhonda Fletcher confronted her about dating another female student when she was 16, which she was in fact doing but denied. Fletcher threatened the young girl, saying she would be tossed from the team and outed to her mother, Wyatt claimed. Fletcher and at least one other coach called Wyatt’s mother in to the school that afternoon to break the news, and then booted her off the team the day after, she said. The coaches’ actions ‘totally destroyed’ Wyatt’s relationship with her mother for ‘almost two years,’ she claimed in a 2011 sworn statement first reported by the Dallas Voice. ‘It was incredibly difficult for me to go through all of the pain of being outed and kicked off the softball team without feeling close to my mom,’ she wrote, according to the Voice. Horror high: The incident occurred at Kilgore High School, about 70 miles west of Shreveport, Louisiana . Wyatt also claimed the traumatic experience negatively affected her grades and led to insomnia, cutting herself and consideration of suicide. Terms of the settlement include the payment and for district employees to undergo sensitivity training at regular intervals for the foreseeable future. The district maintained in a statement that its employees had done nothing wrong, that the settlement was made by their insurance company and that no policies will be changed. ‘The Kilgore ISD board believes that the actions of its employees were in all things lawful,’ the school said. ‘No policies are going to be withdrawn, changed or modified.’ ‘The payment of settlement funds in this case… is a business decision of the insurance company,’ the statement continued, adding that it is not possible to appeal. Wyatt has not spoken publicly about the settlement or its terms, she was not immediately reachable by MailOnline.","The school district's insurance carrier - not the school - settled with 21-year-old Skye Wyatt .

New study results out of the University of Pittsburgh say that the higher your levels of anxiety, the more likely you are to suffer a stroke. The long-term research looked at over 6,000 patients starting in the mid-1970s. Their evidence suggests that even moderately increased anxiety can increase chances of the potentially deadly or debilitating ailment. Cause for concern? A study that followed 6,000 people beginning in the 1970s has concluded that anxiety is a serious risk factor for stroke . The top worst 33 percent of anxiety sufferers were found to have a whopping one-third higher chance of having a stroke than those with the least amount of anxiety. The study was led by Maya Lambiase, whose team collected data on participants aged 25 to 74. They filled out questionnaires and were given tests to determine their levels of anxiety and depression. For decades thereafter, researchers kept track of the strokes experienced by the thousands of participants. Could it happen to me? The worst third of anxiety sufferers in the study were 33 percent more likely to suffer a stroke than the least anxious third of participants . They discovered that, other risk factors like smoking and high blood pressure aside, anxiety was its own major contributing risk factor to stroke. ‘Everyone has some anxiety now and then. But when it's elevated and/or chronic, it may have an effect on your vasculature [blood vessel system] years down the road,’ Lambiase said. Research noted that risk factors like smoking—which people with anxiety tend to more commonly do—were more likely to lead to stroke than anxiety alone. But Lambiase and her team said that the direct biological effects should be considered when assessing risk and seeking to prevent stroke. ‘Given anxiety is highly prevalent in the population, our findings suggest that assessing anxiety symptoms may contribute to developing more effective preventive and intervention strategies for reducing stroke risk,’ the study concluded. Preventable? The researchers concluded that the direct biological effects of anxiety should be used in helping assess risk for and ways to prevent stroke .","The University of Pittsburgh study gathered data on 6,000 people starting in the 1970s .

Acquitted Trayvon Martin killer George Zimmerman’s latest dust-up hasn’t prevented him from getting his small arsenal back from local police. Mr Zimmerman, 30, had his five guns seized after being arrested last month and charged with domestic assault after a fight with girlfriend Samantha Scheibe, 27. The pair both picked up their guns and ammunition from the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office together Wednesday – her’s were seized at the time as well, according to the New York Daily News. Served: George Zimmerman was served with both assault charges and divorce papers during his most recent stint behind bars before he was able to post bail . Ms Scheibe called police November 18 to report that Mr Zimmerman had pointed a shot gun at her in their home – leading to police to arrest him and seize his firearms. ‘You put your gun in my freakin' face!’ Ms Scheibe yelled at her infamous boyfriend during the 911 call. ‘Get out of my house. Do not push me out of my house. Please get out of my house,’ she continued. ‘He pushed me out of my house and locked me out… He knows how to do this, he knows how to play this game,’ she told the dispatcher. Cops took a .380-caliber handgun, a 9-mm handgun, a Glock 19 handgun, a Kel-Tec 12-gauge shotgun and an AR-15 assault-style rifle that belonged to Mr Zimmerman, according to the New York Daily News. He also recovered more than 100 rounds of ammunition taken by authorities as well. Mr Zimmerman was also famously served divorce papers by his estranged wife Shellie Zimmerman while sitting in jail before posting bail. Standing by her man: Despite numerous blow-ups and run-ins with the law during their brief relationship, Samantha Scheibe is standing by Mr Zimmerman . The blonde was not injured during the altercation, but was clearly shaken by his aggressive behaviour. A friend of Ms Schiebe’s told MailOnline in the days after the altercation that many feared the relationship would end badly. ‘We would all talk about where the relationship was going, and we knew it would end badly,’ the woman said. ‘He is just a time bomb waiting to go off.' Her comments echoed those of Lake Mary police chief Steve Bracknell, who also agreed via email to a concerned resident that Mr Zimmerman is ‘a ticking time bomb.’ Given the latest developments, in which Ms Schiebe did an about-face and denied Mr Zimmerman ever pointed the gun at her, authorities had no choice but to give him back his guns. A Lake Mary Police spokesperson told MailOnline earlier this year that though there is the perception that Mr Zimmerman is a threat, authorities have no choice but to allow him to have his guns unless he is convicted of a crime that would bar him from doing so.","George Zimmerman's firearms were seized by police after he was charged with assault in a domestic violence case .

Sad loss: Director Scott Kalvert died aged just 49 in a suspected suicide . Director: Kalvert on-set of his second and final film Deuces Wild in 2002 . Kalvert's career began in the late 1980s, when the first music video he directed, Parents Just Don't Understand by Will Smith and DJ Jazzy Jeff, was a massive hit. He went on to direct videos for other artists including Cyndi Lauper, Mark Wahlberg in his Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch incarnation, Bobby Brown and Snoop Doggy Dogg (currently Snoop Lion). Kalvert then turned his talents to films, turning his favorite book, the 1978 memoir of Jim Carroll, 'The Basketball Diaries', into a film of the same name starring a then-unknown Leonardo DiCaprio as Carroll and Lorraine Bracco as his mother. Wahlberg also starred, setting all three on the road to stardom. Kalvert made only one other film, 2002's 'Deuces Wild,' about rival New York street gangs in the 1950s. Breakout: Kalvert cast young unknown Leonardo DiCaprio in The Basketball Diaries alongside Mark Wahlberg and Lorraine Bracco . Scott Kalvert was born in New York City on August 15, 1964. He studied film at Emerson College in Boston and won an MTV competition which led to his first directing job with a New York-based production company. He moved to Los Angeles in 1990.

He attended a question and answer session about his life and career at the Lyric Theater in Florida, and upon leaving was mobbed by autograph hunters armed with pictures of the 81-year-old actor with the beautiful Wood in their youth. And while he made no comment on the investigation, on stage he paid tribute to the actress wife he 'loved very much'. Back on the scene: Robert Wagner signs autographs for fans, including a photo of himself and dead wife Natalie Wood in Florida last month . Silence is golden: It was the 81-year-old's first appearance since it was announced police had reopened the investigation into Wood's death . Wagner recalled: 'One of the highlights of all time was . working with Natalie on a ‘Cat on a Hot Tin Roof’ … I loved her very . much.' He also shared a footage of himself and Wood cutting his 30th birthday cake. Wagner has kept a low profile since the announcement police were reopening the . investigation into the mysterious death of his wife Natalie Wood. Wood died November 29, 1981 while she was boating with her husband, Robert Wagner, and actor Christopher Walken, off Catalina Island in California. Sealed lips: Robert Wagner refused to comment on speculation about Natalie Wood's death when he arrived at a theatre in Florida today . The couple had reportedly argued that night, but there was no determination of foul play following Wood’s death. The Los Angeles County coroner’s . office said the actress could have slipped and fallen into the water . while trying to secure a dinghy to the boat. Seen earlier in the day Wagner refused to speak about the developments. The Austin Powers star also refused to talk about accusations by the boat's captain he had a role in her death and covered up the events of the night. Despite the recent reopening of the case, so far the actor is not said to be in consideration as a suspect. Defensive: Mr Wagner was reported to have been shocked when he was asked about recent developments in the case . A little less conversation: Ironically he was at the theatre as he is staging a show titled A Conversation with Robert Wagner . It follows the captain of the yacht from which his then wife fell and drowned passing a polygraph test over his account of the incident. Dennis Davern, 62 , said he heard the West Side Story star rowing with her husband Mr Wagner minutes before she disappeared. He has said he believes the 81-year-old had a role in his late wife's death. Telling the truth: Dennis Davern has passed a polygraph test over his account of the night that Natalie Wood died . Davern had a lie detector test performed on him by examiner Howard Temple, who says that the results of the polygraph 'indicated he was telling the truth.' Temple told Good Morning America that Davern explained how after Wood’s death Wagner instructed him to not talk about the drowning. 'Davern made the statement that he stayed at the Wagner home … [was] told not to talk …Wagner paid for his therapy, and Davern could not leave the estate without bodyguards,' Temple relayed. When asked if Wagner, who has one daughter Courtney, 37 , with Natalie and is the adopted father of her child Natasha Gregson, 41 , from a Wood's previous marriage, should take responsibility for her death, Davern replied: 'Yes I would say so.' Married life: Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood attend an event in LA in 1980, a year before her tragic death . He also mentioned his own culpability, and recalled: 'We didn’t take any steps to see if we could locate her. It was a matter of don’t look too hard, don’t turn on search light, don’t call anyone.' Davern also admitted that he lied to officials in the initial police report. His motives for revealing this damning account of that fateful night are being questioned as he has co-authored a book about the actress’s death. He and Marti Rulli wrote the 2009 book Goodbye Natalie, Goodbye Splendour, about the circumstances surrounding the actress’ death at 43, just off the island of Catalina in California. He and Lana Wood, Natalie Wood’s sister, asked authorities to re-open the case last year, the latter believes that Natalie would never have willingly gone near the water because she was terrified of it. The Splendour: The infamous vessel as it is today . According to ABC news, detectives have now interviewed Marilyn Wayne, the witness who was aboard a ship 40 yards away that night in 1981. She claims she heard Wood screaming for help moments before she allegedly drowned off the coast of Catalina Island in California. 'They talked to me about what I remember from the case all those years ago,' Wayne told “Entertainment Tonight.” Actor Christopher Walken, now 68, with whom she was filming the movie Brainstorm, was also aboard the boat that night. The official cause of Wood’s death was determined to be accidental drowning, speculation has been rife about the exact details and the case remains one of Hollywood’s longest-running mysteries. Lifeguard: Roger Smith believes he could've saved Natalie if he'd been called earlier . Lifeguard Roger Smith, who found Wood's body in the water, has told Good Morning America that he believes the actress may have floated alive for hours. 'I could have saved her,' Smith said, adding that he was 'not called in time.' So far Wagner and Walken, the two men with Wood that night, are keeping quiet regarding the reopening of the case. When gossip website TMZ.com caught up with Walken in West Hollywood on Tuesday to ask him what he thinks about the reopening of the case, Walken said: 'I don’t know.' Wagner, best known for the series Hart to Hart,” is filming an appearance as a murder suspect on an episode of CBS’ NCIS this week.

Lufthansa is refuting passengers’ claims they spent five hours Tuesday night stuck on a tarmac without food or water only to return to the gate. The roughly 300 people expecting to fly Tuesday from Boston Logan Airport to Frankfurt during a snow storm fell victim to a ‘unique’ series of events that led to them not being fed or given water during an evening most would prefer to forget. An airline spokesperson rebutted to MailOnline claims of starvation and thirst, and offered an explanation as to why full meals weren’t served during the lengthy delay. Five hour horror: Passenger Shawn Cabral shows the size of the 'small plastic cup of water' he was served . Passengers streaming off the doomed flight complained to WCVB of the uncomfortable conditions. ‘We’re told we can't put our seat back, that we can't use our cellphone, we can't go to the bathroom except for emergency, can't loiter in the aisles,’ Deamiana Andoneva griped. Lufthansa spokesperson Nils Haupt told MailOnline that people were allowed to use their phones and go to the bathroom, but were restricted in their movements around the cabin because of space constraints. ‘Everyone was allowed to use the restroom, everyone was allowed to use their phones,’ he said. ‘You wouldn’t allow people to walk around inside the cabin freely because of the size of the cabin.’ Shawn Cabral complained of being given very little water and fed only small bags of crackers. ‘They offered us a little plastic cup of water and one little bag of Goldfish crackers shaped like airplanes,’ said Mr Cabral. Back problems: This pregnant passenger complained of intense back pain after not being allowed to put her seat back during the delay . The culprit: Both Lufthansa and Massport, which runs Logan Airport, blamed a broken snow plow similar to this one for marooning the plane . A pregnant woman told of her discomfort, saying she was 'in terrible back pain.' Lufthansa spokesperson Nils Haupt told MailOnline that a broken snow plow was partly to blame for the delay, something Massport officials confirmed to WCVB. A MailOnline message left for further comment from the agency went unreturned. Further complicating issues, Mr Haupt explained, was the lack of lighting on the runway. A separate vehicle was needed to light the taxiway as the plane made its way to de-icing. The snow plow broke on the way to deicing, stranding the plane while emergency repairs were made, according to Mr Haupt. The airport received just under five inches of snow during the storm, according to the National Weather Service. This led to the uncertainty about whether or not the flight would leave – causing the flight crew to follow what he claims are established protocols in the airline industry. Hot food could not be served to 300 people because the plane cannot take off while people are eating. Chaos: The airport was blanketed Tuesday with almost five inches of snow, wreaking havoc on many flights . ‘You could serve warm food, what would happen if the snow plow was taken away and you could take off – it would take one hour to clear away the food’ the spokesperson explained. The decision to return to the gate was made just before 7.30, but no gates were available, according to Mr Haupt. ‘The airport was chaos,’ he added. The plane was granted a gate just before 9pm, but then there was a problem with the luggage. The airline’s crew was busy with another plane, and only one luggage cart was available to use. Each luggage cart holds roughly 15 pieces, Mr Haupt said. Peace offering: The airline put everyone affected into hotel rooms for the night and booked them on flights the following day or two days later . ‘We were told our baggage would be in in 20 minutes,’ Mr Cabral told WCVB. ‘After 20 minutes, they repeated it, another 20 minutes, another 20 minutes.’ ‘At 1.30 in the morning, we finally got our luggage.’ Mr Haupt apologized for the unusual series of events that led to the extreme delay. All passengers were given hotel rooms and booked on flights either Wednesday or Thursday, he added. ‘I know it’s an annoyance… we deeply apologize for what happened,’ he said. ‘It added up and I am really extremely sorry… sometimes things go wrong and this time everything went wrong.’","A Lufthansa flight from Boston to Frankfurt never left after a snow plow broke down during a storm .

They have run riot at Simon Cowell's multi-million dollar Hollywood home - and helped him prepare for impending fatherhood. And in a sign of just how spoilt cute Yorkshire terrier puppies Squiddly and Diddly are - they are being flown back to the UK for Christmas by security guard, MailOnline can reveal. While music mogul Cowell, 54, will leave for his annual Caribbean jaunt following the final of tonight's X Factor final, his pets will be flown in business class on an Air France flight to Paris. From there, they will either drive or travel on the Eurostar across the English Channel to Cowell's $14.4million London home, where they will stay for the holidays. Indeed, the dogs - brother and sister - will set up home at the exclusive London address and stay there until Cowell and his pregnant girlfriend Lauren Silverman arrive in the Spring. The couple will travel to London - along with their newborn son, due on February 28 - as Cowell - whose fortune is now estimated at $370million - will be filming Britain's Got Talent. A business class flight on Air France will cost around $10,000. And a source said; 'Squiddly and Diddly are very well looked after, to say the least. 'But they have to travel in business class as Simon and Lauren really don't want to put them in the hold.' Because dogs aren't allowed to travel in the cabin on a British carrier, Squiddly and Diddly will land in Paris before being taken to London. The source added: 'Squiddly and Diddly have been to the vet and had their shots. When they're in the UK, they'll get their UK passports which will make it easier for them to travel.' Cowell and Lauren adopted the dogs in October - and he says they are helping him ‘road test’ his £22 million Beverly Hills mansion before the arrival of their son, nicknamed Baby Simon. Home for the holidays: Simon Cowell's dogs Squiddly and Diddly are being flown back to Britain for Christmas - while their master is away in the Caribbean . Bumping along: Pregnant Lauren Silverman shows off her bump as she holds hands with Simon Cowell as they head to dinner at Sur in West Hollywood last week . Cradling the puppies in his arms, a . clearly smitten Cowell told the Mail on Sunday last month: ‘I’m . experimenting right now with Squiddly and Diddly. ‘I . think dogs are good training for babies. They are still puppies and . they are falling in the swimming pool and getting lost in the house. ‘This . is a bit of a road test for the real thing. Squiddly is the girl and . Diddly is the boy and they are very naughty but great fun. I would say . to anyone thinking about getting a dog – just do it. They bring so much . happiness into your life.’ The Yorkies have free run of the house and spend most nights curled up at the foot of their master’s king-sized bed. Cowell, . who once admitted he was ‘fanatical’ about everything in his house . being ‘just so’, has clearly relaxed his rules for the new additions to . his family. Where he goes, we go: Simon Cowell cuddles his new Yorkshire terrier puppies during a TV interview . Life is tweet: Cowell has been posting uncharacteristically soppy messages about the dogs, like the on above which contained a picture of Squiddly . Meanwhile, as the Mail revealed, Lauren, seven-months pregnant with Cowell's baby, will be spending Christmas with her son Adam, seven. But the couple will spend time together over Christmas period as she will be renting a villa in the Caribbean with her son - while Cowell will be cruising around Barbados on the Slipstream yacht with friends including ex Sinitta, for the festive season. When Adam - whom she considers her first priority - spends New Year with his father, New York property millionaire magnate Andrew Silverman, the 36-year-old brunette will join Cowell on board. Cowell’s romance with Lauren is said to have developed during past Caribbean jaunts. Rex factor: Cowell seems to be enamoured with Squiddly, who is the female one of the puppies . Their flirtations became obvious to friends during Simon’s Christmas break to Barbados in 2011, when Lauren and her husband were invited. Their divorce was made final earlier this month. They are now widely expected by friends to marry. Their baby boy will be born in New York, where Lauren's mother Carole Saland can travel in from her home in Florida. And so far, Cowell and Lauren have been practicing at parenthood with their dogs. In one . shot, Diddly is seen drinking water from a fine china cup and saucer . placed on a designer leather side table while Squiddly – who is . virtually identical to her brother except for an ear which flops over – . perches on a silk cushion on the custom-made sofa. Another picture shows the pair relaxing on top of Cowell’s magnificent grand piano. A source said: ‘Simon is devoted to the dogs. He adores them and they have the run of the place. 'Whenever they go missing they’ve usually raced upstairs to find Simon. Normally there isn’t a pillow out of place but he’s relaxed the rules for the puppies. They are very much his babies but he’s definitely the master. He went away recently and  when he came back he had to have words with Diddly because he was strutting a little. ‘There was a bit of a drama when one of them almost fell into the swimming pool the other day. Obviously the whole house will be properly child–proofed before the baby arrives. But the dogs have been a wonderful addition to the household.  Simon has a dog trainer but it’s pretty obvious they are the ones training him now.’ It is thought Cowell named the pooches after his favourite 1960s cartoon about a musical squid called Squiddly Diddly. But during an earlier season of the US X Factor, he referred to his fellow judges Nicole Scherzinger and Paula Abdul by the moniker, dismissing them with the words: ‘I think the audience at home are going to disagree with Squiddly and Diddly here.’ Dog house: The cute pooches seem to be enjoying life in the music mogul's £22m Beverly Hills mansion, above . There has been online speculation that a . private chef cooks for the pups, but it is, in fact, Cowell who is in . charge at meal times. They are being raised on organic canned dog-food, . which their master feeds them twice a day. He and Lauren walk them . together every evening. The puppies are house-trained and have had piles of dog toys lavished upon them, according to insiders. Cowell says he will set up a Twitter account for the Yorkies soon, and has already used his own account to post pictures of the dogs. One was labelled, ‘Happiness is 2 puppies asleep’, another shows a dozing Squiddly with her eyes rolling back with the caption ‘Squiddly has gone mad’ and in another she is lounging on his bed with her tongue poking out, with the message: ‘Squiddly wants an ice cream.’ Lap of luxury: Squiddly and Diddly relax on the pristine sofa at Simon Cowell's Beverly Hills home . The pups have already had a taste of the spotlight, appearing on TV  in America as their owner filmed segments promoting the latest series of the American X Factor. Cowell has long been a dog-lover and has said: ‘I’m going to leave my money to charity, probably dogs and kids. I don’t believe in passing it on from one generation to another.’ He is also a huge fan of dog acts, backing talented pooch Pudsey to win Britain’s Got Talent last year.","Cowell and girlfriend Lauren Silverman adopted the cute pups in October .

Michelle Tea says her wedding day last month was 'the best moment' of her life but there was one thing troubling her throughout; the dead five-month-old baby inside her tummy. The author, 42, from San Francisco, who had been undergoing IVF treatment with her partner Dashiell Lippman for two years, found out her fetus' heart had stopped shortly before her big day. In a candid first person piece for XOJane, she revealed that she was unable to book a medical abortion before her November 9 nuptials and was terrified of miscarrying 'all over' her bridal gown at the alter. Traumatic experience: Michelle Tea, 42, (right) from San Francisco, who had been undergoing IVF treatment with her partner Dashiell Lippman (left) for two years, found out her fetus' heart had stopped shortly before her wedding day - she later underwent an abortion . 'I wanted this clot of cells taken out of me so I could go on with my life,' she recalled. She and Ms Lippman opted for a 'two mom' approach, allowing them to share the biological role in parenthood. To do this doctors mixed Ms Lippman's eggs in a lab dish with donor sperm and then implanted the embryo in Ms Tea's uterus. The same-sex couple underwent the procedure in July, and doctors confirmed the two women were expecting a baby. However, five months later Ms Tea learned the undeveloped child had died. Recounting the harrowing experience, she wrote: 'I didn’t have sentimental feelings about it; once I learned it didn’t have a heartbeat and had stopped developing weeks ago I’d ceased thinking of it as my future child who will grow up. '[Instead, I] had begun regarding it as a strange, gelatinous bit of sea life that had washed up on the shores of my uterus. Get it out.' At her wedding there were several guests who asked about her pregnancy because they hadn't received 'the text' announcing the news. Indeed, Ms Tea wrote:' My friend Weezy hissed, “Are you pregnant?” 'Poor Weezy, nobody must have sent her the text! I actually didn’t mind telling her. I was, but I’m miscarrying right now. Her eyes grew wide. “Oh, girl!” I know, I nodded.' But Weezy wasn't the first make the mistake, and Ms Tea said she was constantly asked about her prominent baby bump - merely the result of a 'mass of cells' and 'months of constipation.' Five days after her wedding she underwent an abortion. She said the procedure was delayed partly because of her 'hectic schedule' and also because she discovered the clinic near her is only open two days a week. 'Once I learned it didn’t have a heartbeat and had stopped . developing weeks ago I'd ceased thinking of it as my future child who . will grow up' 'How in the world can that be enough to accommodate all the ladies in San Francisco that need abortions?' she exclaimed. The entire visit from start to finish took around four hours. Ms Tea said there was lots of 'waiting around and the termination itself only took around five to ten minutes. After being administered some 'Novocaine-like stuff ' to numb her cervix doctors explained that she might start feeling dizzy or nauseous or get a metallic taste in her mouth. Recalling what happened next, she wrote: 'After a couple hours it was finally time for me to don my assless smock and climb onto the table. 'It was so awesome that Dashiell could stand beside me the whole time, holding my hand and looking into my eyes. Her face is my most favorite thing on the planet.' While she was 'super doped up' doctors tried to distract her from what was going on with a 'steady stream of inane chatter.' Ms Tea continued: 'The pressure to engage was sort of exhausting. I was so doped up I didn’t want to talk. If I made any sort of noise someone – or all of them – would quickly ask if I was in pain. No, no, no pain. But I could feel a terrible tugging deep inside, a yanking.' She said she was glad when the procedure was over and she was free to go home. The accomplished author, poet and literary arts organizer previously told MsFitMag.com that she first experienced 'some sort of biological alarm clock' when she was about 27 years old. But at the time she wasn't 'intellectually interested' in having a child and also described herself as a 'dirt-poor alcoholic.' After meeting Ms Lippman in her late thirties she felt ready to start a family. She has been documenting her pregnancy journey as part of a regular column for XOJane since November 2011.","Michelle Tea, 42, from San Francisco, who had been undergoing IVF treatment with her partner Dashiell Lippman for two years .

After the incident, many of the students went back home to Srinagar, the main city in the state. Several claimed they had been discriminated against. Muteebul Majid, a business administration student in his 20s, said: ‘We didn't do anything illegal. Are they slapping these charges against us for being Kashmiris or for cheering for the Pakistani team?’ Gulzar Ahmed, also a business administration student, said he and his friends were never given a chance to explain themselves.

The family of a pregnant 21-year-old who was strangled and raped are campaigning to change a Wisconsin law that let her killer avoid a murder charge because he was drunk. Brian Cooper, 36, was found guilty last year of sexually assaulting Alisha Bromfield, but the jury were unable to decide on the murder charge because he had been intoxicated at the time of the killing. Miss Bromfield's family are now trying to overturn the law which prevents a murder charge while drunk because a killer's intent can't be proved if intoxicated. Justice: The family of Alisha Bromfield are trying to change a Wisconsin law that stopped her killer being found guilty of murder . Cooper is alleged to have strangled the 21-year-old, from Plainfield, Illinois, when she refused to restart their relationship. Afterwards, he sexually assaulted the body of Miss Bromfield, who was six months' pregnant. The pair had been in Wisconsin for a family wedding at the time of the attack, in August 2012. Miss Bromfield, and her unborn baby girl who she planned to call Ava, died in the attack. During his trial in June, Cooper's defense was that the alcohol he had during and after his sister's wedding reception inhibited his ability to form intent. He has never denied killing Bromfield. Jury foreman Mark A. Hagen told the Green Bay Press Gazette the jury's main disagreement was over the meaning of a line in their instructions. Charges: Brian Cooper was accused of killing and sexually assaulting Alisha Bromfield . Loss: Alisha was expecting a baby girl who she planned to call Ava . It read: 'If the defendant was so intoxicated that the defendant did not intend to kill Alisha Bromfield, you must find the defendant not guilty of first-degree intentional homicide.' After the trial, Miss Bromfield's family launched an online campaign, calling for supporters to sign a petition to overturn the law. On a Facebook campaign page the family posted a notice about a senate hearing on the law that is taking place next week. 'This bill is to eliminate voluntary . intoxication as a defense for criminal liability,' the post read. 'This new petition will go to the House and Senate and the . Governor. This will be the last petition. The judicial committee was . very impressed last week on how we were able to get 6,300 signatures in . 48 hour. we are almost there. Attack: Cooper is accused of strangling Alisha Bromfield and sexually assaulting her body at a Wisconsin hotel . 'All of our hard work and dedication to . Alisha and Ava is finally here.' Miss Bromfield's mother, Sherry Anicich, told CBS Chicago: 'Being drunk is no excuse for murder. We are trying to get a law passed that amends voluntary intoxication that it cannot be used as a defense for murdering.' While she admitted that any law change may not have an impact in the trial of her daughter's alleged killer, Ms Anicich said she hopes it will help other cases. 'If it helps somebody in the future, then we’re hoping that another family doesn’t have to endure a trial or endure someone to walk free because they are intoxicated,' she said. Cooper is due to be retried on the murder charges in the deaths of Miss Bromfield and her unborn baby on May 5.","Jury were unable to agree on homicide charge at Brian Cooper's trial because of Wisconsin laws on intent .

A person claiming to have an X-rated tape of the late Tonight Show host Johnny Carson and one of his wives is shopping the video around to private collectors. According to TMZ, the owner of the video, which dates from the late-1970s, tried to sell it to the Johnny Carson estate last year but was rebuffed. The executors of the estate threatened to sue the owner of the video if was ever released. Screen legend: A sex tape featuring Johnny Carson is being shopped around to private buyers, reports TMZ . '70s sex tape: The tape features a woman with a dark, bouffant hairstyle, suspected to be Carson's third wife Joanna Holland . Ladies man: Carson with Zsa Zsa Gabor (left) and his third wife Joanna Holland (right) in 1972 . However, the video is now being touted to private collectors for an undisclosed sum. For legal reasons the video cannot be sold to a porn distribution company. Six-time Emmy winner Carson was married four times. He divorced his second wife Joan Copeland in 1972 and married his third, former model Joanna Holland that same year. The tape allegedly features Carson and a dark haired woman with a bouffant 'do who has not been named but is purportedly one of his wives, meaning Holland is likely to be the woman in question. The raunchy tape has two locations - by the pool and in the bedroom, reports TMZ. And Carson was apparently a gifted performer both on and off-screen. The . legendary host was also a well-known lothario. In between his four . marriages - at least one of which was blighted by infidelity - Carson . was a committed ladies man. Legal threat: Carson's estate was offered the video to purchase but refused and threatened to sue its peddler (Carson is pictured here with Holland) Fun and games: Carson, pictured with another Gabor, Eva, was a notorious skirt-chaser and was married four times . According to the biography 'Johnny Carson,' written by the star's longtime lawyer  and confidant Henry Bushkin, he once had a contract out on his life from the mob due to his romantic entanglements. During his third marriage to Joanna Holland, wrote Bushkin, Carson showered her with gifts, including an apartment at The Pierre, a Rolls-Royce Corniche, and diamonds galore, as compensation for his many indiscretions. 'Joanna discovered a film of Johnny in flagrante with a comely young lady,' Bushkin writes, 'after which she furiously shattered every vase, every picture frame, every single thing made of glass in her living room, creating such a dangerous mess that a hazmat team had to be hired to clean up.' Carson passed away in 2005 at the age of 79. He is survived by his fourth wife Alexis Maas Carson. There is no word yet on a buyer for the video.","A sex tape featuring late Tonight Show host Johnny Carson is being peddled to private buyer for an undisclosed sum .

Security officers from Manchester University discovered her outside an entrance to a building on Booth Street East, with the keys in the ignition. She appeared to be asleep so they tried to rouse her - but called police after smelling alcohol, prosecutors said. Police discovered a half drunk bottle of whisky in the footwell of the car. Sitting in the car with her was a young child who was said to be extremely cold and shivering. He had also wet himself and was taken into protective custody by police. The court was told the child had some marks on his face and was checked at hospital and found to be 'fine' other than being cold. Willan, from Whitefield, near Bury in Greater Manchester, was arrested after failing a breath test. At the station, she gave a reading of 64mg in 100ml of breath, nearly twice the legal limit. She told police a friend had visited her home on the evening of the incident on Friday, December 6, and persuaded her to drink as many as five brandy and cokes.

Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni are taking legal action over a secret recording where the model refers to her husband as a 'kept man'. The multi-millionaire heiress, who is notorious for her high living, is also heard complaining about having to 'keep' her much poorer husband who was ousted as president in May 2012 by Socialist candidate François Hollande. In the recording, made during the 2012 election campaign in 2011 by a senior aide to Mr Sarkozy, Ms Bruni-Sarkozy said she looked forward to making money out of selling 'wrinkle cream' like US stars Julia Roberts and Sharon Stone. Nicolas Sarkozy (left) was 'kept' by his far wealthier wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy (right) during his time as French President . In the recording Ms Bruni-Sarkozy (pictured left with The Queen during a state visit in 2008) was recorded complaining about losing 'fabulous contracts' Revelations that Patrick Buisson, part of Sarkozy's inner circle, recorded hours of talks with the conservative leader and his entourage have caused uproar in the opposition UMP party weeks before local elections. Mr Buisson can be heard in the tapes, . leaked by the Canard Enchaine investigative magazine, referring to Mr . Sarkozy as 'the dwarf”. Sarkozy is expected by many to contest the 2017 presidential election after his defeat by Francois Hollande two years ago. 'Mr Nicolas Sarkozy and Mrs Carla Bruni-Sarkozy cannot accept that remarks made in private were recorded and published without their consent,' lawyers Thierry Herzog and Richard Malka said in a statement. '(They) have decided to prosecute, through an emergency proceeding soon to be filed with the Paris Grand Instance Court, the recording and publication of their conversations,' they said. 'Protecting the secrecy of private conversations is... one of the founding principles of a democratic society.' Since leaving office in 2012 Mr Sarkozy has faced a range of corruption inquiries, all related to racking in millions of euros in cash illegally . Excerpts of the tapes were published this week in satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine and right-wing news site Atlantico.fr. Ms Bruni-Sarkozy, who gave up most of her commercial activities when she became Mr Sarkozy's third wife, said: 'I had fabulous contracts, and then nothing at all. 'Afterwards, I’m going to sign new contracts. I am not going to wait terribly long. If I can manage a cool little contract.' Ms Bruni-Sarkozy, whose heyday was as a . model in the 1990s, adds: 'You agree, they’re not going to sell . anti-wrinkle cream to a girl of 22, right? Julia Roberts, 44, Sharon . Stone, 52, Julianne Moore 53. 'All those are fabulous contracts, no? I . can’t do it for the moment, because it’s not done.' Mr Sarkozy then interrupts the jovial conversation, saying:  'I tell you, my future is to run the cash register.' The embarrassing secret recordings highlight . the greed of a couple who were notorious for their 'bling bling' lifestyle at the Elysee Palace. The former First Lady said she looked forward to making money out of selling 'wrinkle cream' like US stars Julia Roberts (left) and Sharon Stone (right) Buisson's lawyer, Gilles-William Goldnadel, said the recordings were authentic. He said his client had made them for historical research purposes and had not intended that they be made public. Breach of privacy in France carries a penalty of up to one year in prison and 45,000 euros in fines. In the published excerpts Sarkozy is heard discussing his electoral strategy and a 2011 cabinet reshuffle, while Bruni is recorded joking about how she had to put her modelling career on ice while she was France's first lady. 'I thought I was marrying a guy with a salary ... I had big contracts and now nothing,' she is heard saying, adding that if Sarkozy went on to lose the election she at least could re-activate her career and start selling anti-wrinkle cream. French media have said dozens of hours of further material could emerge from recordings that date back to 2011. Goldnadel said the recordings, which Buisson made using a device in his pocket and later uploaded to his personal computer, had been stolen from Buisson and that he would file a complaint for theft against 'persons unknown'. 'There will be an investigation to determine exactly how these recordings were taken,' Goldnadel told BFM TV. He added that his client thought he knew who had stolen them, but did not give names.

A California man who gambled away $500,000 and is suing the Las Vegas casino in which he lost it has explained why the gambling palace is to blame for his loss. Retiree Mark Johnston says the Downtown Grand Casino served him so many drinks that he has no memory of playing table games all day. 'I believed that they were just trying to take advantage of a player,' Johnston told CBS News. Taking a gamble: Mark Johnson is citing Nevada gambling legislation in his suit for $500,000 . 'If you're intoxicated, you're not allowed to gamble. They're supposed to stop you.' A lawyer for Mark Johnston says his client was so drunk when he lost the money that he couldn't see his playing cards. Johnston is suing the casino, citing Nevada gambling laws, which forbid 'permitting persons who are visibly intoxicated to participate in gaming activity' and 'complimentary service of intoxicating beverages in the casino area to persons who are visibly intoxicated.' He's not willing to take responsibility for being 'blackout drunk' either. 'I believe them just keep bringing me drinks, I blame that on them, and then continuously letting me gamble and letting me drink, I blame that on them,' he told CBS News. Johnston estimates that he had two to four drinks at the Burbank airport, one drink on the  flight to Las Vegas, two drinks in his limousine when he arrived, and 'several more' drinks at dinner. After dinner, a 17-hour gambling binge ensued, which, says Johnston, he doesn't remember. But memory or no, Johnston appears to have had quite the time in Sin City. So much so that he took out a loan with the hotel for $500,000. And promptly lost it all. And therein lies their claim, said Johnston's attorney Sean Lyttle. 'You certainly aren't to issue half a million dollars in markers to someone who's intoxicated,' he said. 'I feel like they picked my pockets,' Johnston told MyNews3. 'I feel like they took a drunk guy...like a . drunk guy walking down the street, and you reach in his pockets and grab . all his money.' Just opened: The Downtown Grand had only been open for a couple of months when Johnston visited there from California in February. The casino is counter-suing Johnston for shirking his gambling debt . The experienced gambler says he's 'won this amount of money, and I've lost this kind of money,' before. Johnston says the surveillance footage is being reviewed. The state Gaming Control Board is investigating. The . Downton Grand does not comment on pending litigation but Lyttle says . the Grand, which opened late last year, is countersuing Johnston for . trying to shirk his gambling debts. Johnston says this all boils down to responsibility and, not surprisingly, he blamed the casino. 'They . should have cut me off,' he said. 'The bottom line is the casinos are . supposed to not gamble to you and not over-serve you in alcohol. That's . gaming regulation.' The casino has offered to settle for less money, but Johnston says he is proceeding with the lawsuit.","Mark Johnston is suing the Downtown Grand casino in Las Vegas after losing $500,000 there .

Vigilante: Keiren Parsons posed as a 14-year-old girl and posted a video of his confrontation online . A man killed himself just days after he was confronted by a controversial ‘paedophile hunter’ and accused of grooming a 14-year-old girl over the internet. MPs last night called for an inquiry after self-styled web vigilante Keiren Parsons – who poses as teenage girls online to entrap men – boasted of close links to police. Father-of-one Michael Parkes, from Daventry, Northamptonshire, was found hanged three days after being exposed by Parsons, aka ‘Stinson Hunter’, and his group. The warehouse manager, 46, had been arrested on suspicion of attempted grooming and released on bail after a video of the confrontation was posted on Facebook. Although police insist Parsons has been repeatedly asked to stop his undercover activity, he claims he has been ‘encouraged and coached’ by officers from Warwickshire Constabulary. The force admits he has spoken to its officers more than 30 times in the past year. Keith Vaz, chairman of the influential Home Affairs Select Committee, last night called for an inquiry. ‘This is a most disturbing case which raises serious questions,’ he said. ‘There should be a full inquiry into the claims that Mr Parsons has acted with the encouragement of some police officers. ‘Individuals should never take the law into their own hands.’ Mr Parkes’s former partner – the mother of his 15-month-old son –  claimed the internet exposure had led directly to his death last June, and said she strongly suspected that Parsons had been given ‘advice and training’ by police. She hopes the coroner at Mr Parkes’s inquest on Wednesday will call for an inquiry into the alleged relationship between Parsons and the police. ‘There are no excuses for what Michael did – going on to a dating website and arranging to meet a 14-year-old is truly appalling and I will never forgive him for that,’ said the 37-year-old woman, who did not want to give her name. Death: Michael Parkes was found hanged after the video of him being accused of grooming a 14-year-old girl was circulated. Warwickshire Police insist they have told Parsons to stop but they are in regular contact . ‘But Parsons has to be stopped before . he drives another man to such despair that he does what Michael did. We . have a justice system in this country and Michael deserved an . opportunity to defend himself in a court of law. ‘Parsons justifies what he does by saying he is protecting children. He isn’t. He is protecting fictional children. My child is real and he is now growing up without a dad and Parsons is responsible. ‘I can’t believe he uses this method of confronting men without some kind of legal advice, compliance or training from the police.’ Parsons, 32, who served a custodial sentence for arson as a teenager, has been disowned by relatives. His grandmother, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Keiren has caused a lot of trouble for the family. We have disowned him. When he was about 16 or 17, he ended up in prison for burning down a school.’ Hunted: The website of Keiren Parsons, who describes his operation as Stinson Hunter . On his website, which collects donations via PayPal, Parsons claims to enjoy a good relationship with police officers in Warwickshire. ‘Numerous officers have encouraged my activities,’ he says. ‘They have advised me on how to approach the people when meeting them, how to collate evidence.’ In January, Warwickshire Police threatened Parsons with legal action if he did not stop his activities. Assistant Chief Constable Karen Manners said he could be ‘compromising’ investigations. Last night a force spokesman said they would investigate claims by Parsons that officers disclosed sensitive information to him. Asked what advice he had been given, the spokesman added: ‘None specifically. Officers have been consistently briefed that they should offer no encouragement to him.’","Michael Parkes, 46, was arrested after confrontation by Keiren Parsons .

Wrong turn: Former 'officer of the year' Mitchell Wright is now in jail facing a host of drug charges . A former deputy with the Seattle police department is in jail, accused of recruiting strippers to work as drug mules and dealers for him in an attempt to take over the drug trade in suburban Shoreline. Mitchell Wright, 33, is facing a host of state and federal charges related to the distribution of methamphetamine, heroin and cocaine. The 10-year King County police force veteran, who was also a task-force officer for the Drug Enforcement Agency, was fired last July after an internal investigation was launched that revealed he had stolen drugs seized by the DEA to the value of about $50,000. He was arrested in August 2013 and . charged with felony theft and heroin possession. According to Seattle . PI, he was alleged to have stolen 1,600 oxycodone pills, a half-pound of . benzodiazepine and about a teaspoon of cocaine. Wright . made a series of bizarre claims after he was arrested, including that . he was immune to prosecution as an Australian diplomat, a King County . detective told the court. 'He . also stated that he had a job lined up in Australia that was going to . pay him $400,000 a year and that he had terminal bone cancer and only . had six months to live,' the detective said in state court filings, . reports Seattle PI. 'He then continued that this investigation was one big misunderstanding.' Wright was released on bail weeks later and subsequently seen at the home of a suspected drug dealer. A joint investigation between the King County detectives and the DEA was launched. Untouchable: Despite being arrested and charged in 2013 (pictured) on drugs charges, ex-cop Mitchell Wright thought his stripper meth ring would be undetectable . An informant told a DEA detective that Wright was recruiting strippers to sell methamphetamine and heroin for him by giving them 'free samples.' He was allegedly sampling the goods himself, using large amounts of meth which made him paranoid yet defiant and convinced he could not be caught. 'Wright bragged to [the informant] and his criminal associates that he could never be caught or arrested, as he knew all of the tricks that police use to investigate drug dealers,' the detective said in court papers. He allegedly had plans to become the drug kingpin in North Seattle. Addict: Police say that in addition to giving strippers 'free samples' to entice them into his drug ring, Wright was sampling the merchandise himself . The dirty cop, who was named 'Shoreline Officer of the Year' seven years ago, was arrested again on February 5 outside a burger joint. According to Seattle PI, he scuffled with officers and attempted to throw away a glasses case fulled with meth, cocaine and heroin. Officers described him as 'extremely agitated' and said he appeared to be under the influence of methamphetamine at the time of his arrest. More outlandish claims followed, with officers reporting Wright claiming he'd fallen in love with a police informant, whom the prosecution would not be able to call as a witness because they were sleeping together. Wright has pleaded not guilty to the latest charges and remains jailed at the Federal Detention Center at SeaTac. His trial is due to begin in April.","Ex-cop Mitchell Wright, 33, is accused of recruiting strippers to sell drugs for him .

Lollipop ladies are being fired by councils to pay for ’Stasi surveillance’ CCTV cameras, the government has claimed. Town halls are accused of buying ’spy cars’ as an excuse to generate fines from parents on the school run on an ’industrial scale’. Local government minister Brandon Lewis warned public trust in CCTV for crime fighting is being undermined by councils using it to generate cash. We're watching you: CCTV cars were legalised in 2004 and there are now more than 100 in use across Britain. Fines worth at least £30 million were handed out last year - but almost half the people who appealed won . Mr Lewis took particular issue with the claim from the Local Government Association the coalition’s move to ban CCTV parking cameras ’will put children at risk’. He said: ’This is a false and spurious claim. CCTV spy cars are a recent and modern innovation from legislation passed by the last Labour Government. ’They are just an excuse for councils to raise money from issuing parking fines on an industrial scale. ’They undermine natural justice, as car owners receive the fine weeks later in the post making it extremely hard to challenge on appeal.’ He insisted the changes would not stop a traffic warden or police officer issuing a penalty notice in the case of genuinely dangerous parking. With more than 100 specially adapted cars across Britain, 'mobile CCTV' has become the bane of many motorists' lives. The . technology was legalised under Labour in 2004, allowing councils to . break from the tradition of always using traffic wardens. Since then more councils have . brought in the technology every year - but while a traffic warden can . be reasoned with, said critics, a machine cannot. High-profile 'victims' included one driver who pulled over to vomit and another whose windscreen had smashed. Drivers . who feel they have been wronged can take their cases to a Traffic . Penalty Tribunal, a network of independent adjudicators, or a parallel . system for London. Adjudicators . often criticise councils and have questioned their definition of the . 'difficult or sensitive' circumstances in which CCTV fines should be . given out. Richmond . Council, south west London, faced having to repay thousands of fines in . 2011 after campaigner Nigel Wise discovered its four cars had not been . properly registered. But in response to a parliament question he added: ’It is hard-pressed parents who get hit with the fines from such Stasi surveillance. ’Public confidence is strengthened in CCTV if it is used to tackle serious crime, not to raise money for town halls by penalising parents dropping off kids on the school run. ’In their rush to bankroll CCTV spy cameras for parking enforcement, it would appear from recent media reports that parts of local government have had no qualms about sacking lollipop men and women. ’Crossing patrols do a sterling job in protecting children from danger—but, unfortunately, unlike spy cars, they do not raise money for council coffers.’ Official figures councils which use CCTV cameras to enforce parking rules raise £49.35 per household each year, compared with £5.69 per household in council areas which do not have them. The Local Government Association has heavily criticised government plans to ban the use of CCTV cameras, with parking wardens only allowed to film if vehicles break the rules, . Peter Box, chairman of the LGA's Economy and Transport Board, said: 'Camera cars have been instrumental in keeping children from being hurt or killed on the way to school, and CCTV also plays an important role elsewhere in monitoring traffic flow and keeping cars moving. 'It is impossible for councils to regulate parking outside thousands of schools by using wardens alone. 'Camera cars are deployed in response to pleas by parents and teachers about cars being parked illegally and recklessly outside the school gates. 'CCTV cars are a highly visible deterrent for those breaking the law and councils will often send warnings to drivers of the consequences of their actions before issuing them with parking fines. ;Banning councils from acting on these community concerns and using CCTV outside schools will put children at risk and leave them and their parents to run the gauntlet of the school run without any protection.'","Brandon Lewis launches outspoken attack on CCTV parking cameras .

Families bereaved by level crossing accidents have received a ‘full and unreserved apology’ from the boss of Network Rail. Chief executive Mark Carne today apologised for the ‘failings’ by the company in ‘managing public safety at level crossings and in failing to deal sensitively with the families affected’. The move came after MPs expressed their concerns that Network Rail showed ‘callous disregard’ on ‘too many occasions’ for families bereaved by accidents at crossings. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne apologised live on ITV programme Daybreak for the 'failings' by the company in 'managing public safety at level crossings and in failing to deal sensitively with the families affected' A report by the House of Commons Transport Committee highlighted the deaths of Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte Thompson, 13, pictured, who were killed at Elsenham crossing in Essex in December 2005 . The MPs said all nine deaths at crossings in 2012/13 were ‘personal tragedies which could have been averted’ and said Mr Carne ‘owes each of the families it let down a full, public apology’. Launching the House of Commons Committee report, chairman Louise Ellman said: 'Victims were erroneously described as 'trespassers' or accused of 'misuse' of the railway when, in fact, they tried to use level crossings appropriately. 'Network Rail's chief executive must provide a full, public apology to all of the families it has let down - both for the mistakes which contributed to the accidental deaths and for the subsequent treatment of bereaved families. 'Network Rail must also demonstrate that it has transformed the way in which it deals with people whose lives are changed by accidents at level crossings.' Today, Network Rail boss Mark Carne apologised for ‘failing to deal sensitively’ with the tragic deaths. He said: ‘I wish to extend a full and unreserved apology on behalf of Network Rail to all those whose life has been touched by a failing, however large or small, made by this company in managing public safety at level crossings and in failing to deal sensitively with the families affected. A cyclist was nearly hit by a train at Waterbeach crossing in Cambridgeshire in 2013 despite the warning lights flashing and the barrier being lowered . A van reversed to narrowly avoid collision at the Marina level crossing, Buckinghamshire, in 2009 . ‘Nothing we can say or do will lessen the pain felt by the families of those killed or injured at a level crossing. Today Network Rail is a very different company to the one which existed at the time of these tragic accidents.’ In the Transport Committee report, MPs said they would be ‘very concerned’ if Network Rail executives got bonuses this year, given the company was recently held responsible for a 2010 incident at Beccles in Suffolk in which a 10-year-old boy suffered life-changing injuries. Another case the committee highlighted was the deaths of Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte Thompson, 13, who were killed at Elsenham crossing in Essex in December 2005. It said the rail company should disclose . to the Elsenham families the findings of all investigations into why . the documents were not initially disclosed. During his apology today, Mr Carne, pictured right on ITV's Daybreak, said the company would address many of the committee's recommendations. He said: 'We will never be complacent when it comes to public safety' During his apology today, Mr Carne said the company would address many of the committee's recommendations. He said: ‘As we made clear when we pleaded guilty during the Elsenham court proceedings, it was a watershed in the way we thought about our approach to the risk at level crossings, and how we treat victims and their families. ‘As a result of this transformation, level crossings in Britain are amongst the safest in Europe, but there is still much that we can, and will, do and the committee's recommendations will help us in that endeavour. ‘We will never be complacent when it comes to public safety. As I start my term as chief executive I have made improving public, passenger and work-force safety absolutely integral to everything Network Rail does. The Transport Committee report said rail regulators should set a target of zero fatalities at level crossings from 2020. A man missed being struck by a moving train as he jumped onto a crossing in Rainham, Kent, in 2009 . ‘Restoring public trust relies on openness and with that in mind we have made risk assessment information relating to almost all our 6,300 crossings available on our website. I will continue to explore ways to make our processes even more transparent so we can demonstrate clearly that we treat our responsibility for ensuring public safety with the utmost professionalism.’ However, Charlotte Thompson's father Reg Thompson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he still found it ‘difficult’ to understand how Network Rail ‘failed to consider the feelings of any of the families involved’. He said: ‘Network Rail showed the utmost disregard to the families, to the point that they never contacted us, showed no concern or compassion at any point and indeed made it very clear that they blamed Charlie and Liv for their own demise up until they were forced to acknowledge their own guilt more than six years after the accident. Mr Carne, pictured, said: 'Nothing we can say or do will lessen the pain felt by the families of those killed or injured at a level crossing' A mother pushed her pram across a railway crossing in front of a moving train at Wareham station in Dorset in 2009 . ‘My daughter died over eight years ago, and still this goes on, and it goes on because of Network Rail's behaviour, because of their refusal over years to acknowledge documents which they knew they had in their possession and to behave in just a human way.’ Mr Carne said that since 2010 Network Rail had reduced the risk at level crossings by a quarter by investing around £130million in level crossing safety improvements. These include closing nearly 800 crossings and appointing more than 100 level crossing managers, building footbridges to replace crossings, installing new warning systems and putting in power-operated gates and using new barrier technology. The House of Commons Transport Committee report said rail regulators should set a target of zero fatalities at level crossings from 2020.

There was no ticket machine on their platform and they had to cross the railway to the other platform to purchase their tickets. After purchasing their tickets, the miniature warning lights and yodel alarm indicated that there was a train approaching.After a train had stopped in the station they opened the unlocked wicket gate and proceeded back across the line. They were hit by a Stansted train.

A restaurant boss who left a contestant on The Voice requiring plastic surgery after throwing a champagne glass at his head for singing too loudly has been jailed. Former The Voice finalist Sam Buttery, 22, 'drew attention to himself' when he sang It’s De-Lovely by Cole Porter as he strolled past Nima Safaei’s upmarket restaurant in Soho, central London, once owned by celeb chef Aldo Zilli. Mr Buttery - who was part of Tom Jones’s team in the first series of the popular BBC talent show - was livid when Safaei, 33, hurled insults at him and told him to 'go to the gym'. The singer, who went on to star in . West End Boy George musical, Taboo, retorted: ‘Don’t you know who I am?’ He then threw the contents of a glass of champagne in Safaei’s face. Safaei . then forcefully launched the champagne flute back at Mr Buttery - . causing a 1.6 inch wound to his head and a cut to his ear. The . restaurant boss was jailed for 15 months at Southwark Crown Court after . he was found guilty of one count of wounding without intent. Safaei . was told he would also have to pay £4,000 compensation to Mr Buttery, . £2,000 costs and a £120 victim surcharge, and his restaurant license was . suspended for 16 months. The . court heard how Mr Buttery’s life had become difficult following the . attack on June 4th last year and he still endures nightmares today as a . result. Peter Zinner, prosecuting, read a . statement outlining how the reality star had lost both work and weight . as a result of the attack and was forced to move back into his mum’s . home in the West Midlands. The . statement said: 'The attack has affected me physically - primarily . causing me to have an artery stitched up in my ear and plastic surgery . to rectify the damage. 'I have nightmares and terrors since the attack and up to the present day. 'I . lost two stone in weight and was unable to go out in public places two . months after the attack without suffering panic attacks. The attack felt . so unnecessary. 'I lived in London for four years and never experienced anything like the attack before. 'After the attack I moved back to my mum’s place in the West Midlands and it has knocked my confidence so much. Everything has been made so much more difficult.' Safaei (right) with friend Mehrak Davoudi. He has now been jailed for throwing the champagne flute at Buttery . Since the attack Mr . Buttery has had to apply for incapacity benefit as he was unable to work . and asked his agent to remove him from their records. During . the four day trial, the court also heard evidence from Mr Buttery’s . friend Daniel Lismore - who has been dubbed ‘London’s most outrageous . dresser’- who was with him at the time. The . actor, DJ and stylist, who wore a black hat and cape, told jurors: 'I . think Sam has had enough of people commenting on his image and he said . he didn’t understand what makes someone say that.' Safaei . had insisted he did not throw the champagne flute and said that he . simply pushed the glass he was holding back ‘with force’. Ian . Dear, in mitigation, said: 'This is the lower end of GBH wounding, . which can result in life changing injuries. I see nothing about Mr . Buttery that suggest his life in anyway has changed following this . offence. 'Mr Safaei is a man . who has worked all his life. He has a good education and worked as a . pharmacist, then became a chef and bought a restaurant which has been . very successful in the years he has owned it. 'He is a professional man, an entrepeneur and what happened that night is completely out of character.' Forty Dean Street, the restaurant where Buttery got into a row with Safaei . Mr Dear also told the court how Mr Buttery appeared to be 'very confident' in his evidence, when he performed the Cole Porter song as he described his version of events to jurors. Safaei, who is Iranian-born and in a long term gay relationship, said Mr Buttery had been 'flirtatious' towards him before the attack, but the judge accepted it was not a homophobic assault. Judge Martin Beddoe said: 'You claimed to have acted in self defence - you did not. 'There . is no indication of any expression of remorse on your part, but . effectively just justification for what you did, and therefore it seems . to me to demonstrate no understanding on your part of both the incident . or your responsibility for it. 'On . the evening of June 4th you took exception to Mr Buttery’s presence . there and without any provocation you shouted offensive remarks towards . him. 'I had cause to suspect . that the reason might have been homophobic - somewhat encouraged by . your complaint that Mr Buttery was being flirtatious...but as I have . said I can’t be sure about that, I make it clear I put this to one side. 'You contend Mr Buttery was encroaching on your personal property - no he was not. He was walking down a public highway. 'Your remarks caused him to confront you as to what you were saying and why you were saying it. You did nothing to calm the situation but everything to inflame it by repeating insults towards him. 'It . was quite a deliberate act and clearly undertaken with some force as . the glass cut the side of his head, shattered in the process and caused . severe lacerations in his ear.' Sam Buttery competing on The Voice, pictured with Holly Willoughby on stage . Mr Beddoe said he had suspicious the attack could have been motivated by hostility towards homosexuals. But he accepted that gay Safaei, who is in a long term relationship, did not glass Mr Buttery as a result of his sexuality. Neither the TV star or Mr Lismore were present in court for the verdict or sentence. Ian Dear, defending Safaei, said he was well educated and had worked all his life, initially as a pharmacist and chef before becoming a restauranteur. He insisted the attack was ‘out of character’ and that Safaei ‘acted impulsively’. Safaei was also dedicated to charity work for ‘down and outs’ in Soho. Mr Dear also disputed whether the glassing had been ‘life changing’ for the victim, telling the court: ‘Mr Buttery appeared very confident when he gave his evidence and burst into song. ‘This was at the lower end of grievous bodily harm type wounding which can result in genuine life changing injuries to a person. ‘It may well be Sam Buttery is highly sensitive to that type of comment (about going to the gym).’ Safaei denied all charges, but has been found guilty.","Sam Buttery drew attention by loudly singing as he walked past restaurant .

The BBC should increase the licence fee in line with inflation and raise more money through commercial ventures, it has been proposed. The broadcaster revealed the suggestion after a newspaper alleged that a secret review into the organisation's funding suggested replacing the licence fee with a subscription service from 2020. The article claimed that the majority of a 12-strong centenary review set up by James Purnell, the former Labour minister turned BBC director of strategy and digital, supported the change. Suggestion: The BBC should increase the licence fee in line with inflation and raise more money through commercial ventures, a report has proposed. New Broadcasting House in London is pictured . The Sunday Times also reported that the review recommended freezing the licence fee until 2020. But a BBC spokesman said: ‘The report recommends that the BBC pursue an inflationary licence fee increase with greater commercial revenue. No subscription model is recommended.' The future funding of the BBC is in the spotlight, with its charter up for renewal in 2017. On Friday, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling mooted the idea of making the non-payment of the licence fee a civil rather than criminal matter to ease the pressure on courts. Cases of people accused of evading the £145.50 annual fee accounted for in excess of one in 10 of all criminal prosecutions last year - with 155,000 convicted and fined. Online: The corporation is also aiming to make more money through a revamp of the iPlayer which will allow viewers to access paid-for programmes from a new BBC download service has been given the go-ahead . Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the proposal, backed by more than 100 MPs, was an ‘interesting’ idea which could form part of negotiations over the renewal of the BBC charter. 'The report recommends that the BBC pursue an inflationary licence fee increase with greater commercial revenue. No subscription model is recommended' BBC spokesman . ‘It is socially unjust that so many are fined and indeed go to prison for not paying the licence fee,’ Mr Elstein said, reported The Sunday Times. ‘And it makes more sense too for the BBC to move to subscription from 2020, which is about the date when set-boxes go, and standard definition is phased out to high definition.’ BBC Director General Lord Hall last week confirmed that digital TV channel BBC3 is set to be axed as part of the latest bout of cost-cutting at the corporation. The channel will move online to save £50million a year, and Lord Hall refused to rule out further cuts, including axing BBC Four.

Last month former Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross said that the current charter should be the last and it should be replaced with a subscription system. Addressing a seminar discussion for the think tank Civitas, he said: ‘The licence fee has just reached the end of its natural lifespan. It's already 88 years old and she will be well into her 90s by the time of charter renewal.’ At the time the BBC said a subscription model would lead to ‘more expensive fees paid for by fewer people’.","BBC should raise more money through commercial ventures, report says .

A marathon spelling bee between two Missouri students who exhausted the initial word list last month ended after 29 more rounds Saturday when the eventual runner-up stumbled over the word 'stifling.' For more than an hour, seventh-grader Kush Sharma and fifth-grader Sophia Hoffman went toe-to-toe in the continuation of the Jackson County Spelling Bee. The linguistic battle began two weeks ago but had to be extended after the two students breezed through the word list provided by the Scripps National Spelling Bee, then 20 more words picked out of the dictionary.

But . at the end of the 28th round, Sophia appeared puzzled when attempting . to spell 'stifling,' and even more so when the bell rang to indicate she . had gotten it wrong. Following a lengthy break to listen to audio of the round to make sure Sophia had heard the word correctly, the judges ruled that she had misspelled it, meaning Kush could claim the title if he correctly spelled his word in the 29th round. After being given his final word, 'definition,' Kush, 13, drew chuckles from spectators watching from a different room in the Kansas City Public Library when he asked for the definition. He promptly spelled it correctly and won the bee. Following the 66-round war of words between the middle-schoolers last month, the judges came on Saturday prepared with 230 approved words and 100 back-ups.

The parents of six-year-old Brynn Williams allege her teacher interrupted the child's speech and told her to sit down because she's 'not allowed to talk about the Bible in school' A six-year-old girl's parents are taking her school to court over claims she was 'humiliated' by a teacher for talking about the Bible in a Christmas show and tell. Attorneys for the family of pupil Brynn Williams allege the teacher interrupted her speech . and told her to sit down because she's 'not allowed to talk . about the Bible in school'. The incident occurred on December 19 inside a first grade classroom at Helen Hunt-Jackson Elementary School in Temecula, in southern California. The previous day the teacher had told her class to find something at home that represented a family Christmas tradition so they could share it in a classroom presentation. Brynn Williams decided to bring in the Star of Bethlehem on top of her family's Christmas tree, FoxNews.com reported, and worked on a 60-second presentation to explain that her family's tradition. 'Our . Christmas tradition is to put a star on top of our tree,' the little . girl said. 'The star is named the Star of Bethlehem. The three kings . followed the star to find baby Jesus, the Saviour of the world.' According . to Robert Tyler, the general counsel for the family's law firm, . Advocates for Faith & Freedom, the teacher intervened before the . child could utter another word. 'Brynn's . teacher said, ""Stop right there! Go take your seat,"" Mr Tyler claimed. 'Brynn was not allowed to finish her presentation by reciting the Bible . verse, John 3:16.' Tyler said the little girl was the only student in the class not allowed to finish her presentation. 'After . Brynn took her seat, the teacher explained to Brynn in front of all the . other students that she was not allowed to talk about the Bible or . share its verses,' Tyler said. Her mother Gina Williams learned about the incident after she picked her daughter up from school.'She thought she had done something wrong. She thought she was in trouble,' Mrs Williams said. 'I told her she was not in trouble and I was proud of her. I tried to comfort her on the way home.' The following day Mrs Williams met with the principal. 'The principal confirmed that Brynn's teacher did the appropriate thing by stopping her mid-presentation and there are specific education codes that protect the school,' she said. The principal then asked Brynn, who had tears in her eyes, to come into her office and deliver the same presentation that was censored in the classroom. The incident allegedly occurred on December 19 inside a first grade classroom at Helen Hunt-Jackson Elementary School (pictured) in Temecula, in southern California . Afterwards, the principal stood by her decision. The principal reportedly told her that Brynn could write about her beliefs in a journal but she was not allowed to share her beliefs aloud to any other student. Mr Tyler sent a letter to the school district demanding they apologise to Brynn and change their policies limiting religious liberty. 'The disapproval and hostility that Christian students have come to experience in our nation's public schools has become epidemic,' he said, warning that should the school district ignore their concerns, they will file a lawsuit. In a statement issued to FoxNews.com, the school district said: 'The Temecula Valley Unified School District respects all students' rights under the Constitution and takes very seriously any allegation of discrimination. â€˜Due to the fact that District officials are currently investigating the allegations, it would be inappropriate to provide further comment at this time.'","Parents allege incident occurred inside a classroom in California .

The headmistress of a school for pupils with extreme behavioural and emotional problems has been critised for allowing children as young as 14 to take cigarette breaks. Students at the Honeyhill pupil referral unit in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, are given 10-minute sessions twice a day to smoke under the supervision of teachers. Headteacher Claire George said the practice helps the teenagers, many of who have emotional, social and behavioural needs which can not be met in mainstream education, to concentrate and encourages them to turn up for lessons. Under fire: The headmistress of the Honeyhill pupil referral unit for children with extreme behavioural and emotional problems has been criticised for allowing students as young as 14 to take cigarette breaks . Pupils have to hand in their cigarettes at the start of the school day and are only allowed them back for the off-site breaks. Mrs George said the children, some who have been permanently excluded from other schools, are only allowed to smoke after the unit has received parental permission. However, Peterborough's Tory MP Stewart Jackson has called for the local authority to review the practice saying children 'should follow the rules'. 'Most reasonable people would be quite surprised by this,' he said. 'They are not adults able to make reasonable choices. They are children who should follow the rules.' One relative of a child at the unit, who asked not to be named, said: 'I am outraged that this is allowed. Rules: Pupils have to hand in their cigarettes at the start of the school day and are only allowed them back for the off-site breaks . 'I thought the school had parental duties when our children are under their care.' Honeyhill caters for around 200 ‘challenged’ pupils who have difficulties in mainstream schools. 'Pupils who attend Honeyhill do so because they have failed, many more than once, in mainstream education,' said Mrs George. 'They are amongst the most challenged and challenging young people within the city and most have complex issues. 'Therefore . our approach has got to be different to give them the best possible . chance of getting an education which allows them to progress into . employment or further education or training. Critical: Peterborough's Tory MP Stewart Jackson has called for the local authority to review the practice saying children 'should follow the rules' 'For those pupils who do smoke, we have a clear procedure in place. Pupils and their parents/carers are asked about health related habits when they start at the school. 'Our approach is that pupils who already smoke on admission can, with parental consent, have up to two 10 minute, off-site, fully supervised smoking breaks a day. 'All pupils are required to hand in smoking related materials at the beginning of each day. 'We appreciate some people will not agree with this approach, but we have found it far more effective than simply banning smoking, which our experience shows us leads to pupils not attending school or absconding during the day to smoke.' An Ofsted visit in December rated Honeyhill ‘good’ with outstanding leadership and management. Peterborough City Council’s website says of the unit: 'The emphasis is on re-engaging through a relevant curriculum, gaining work experience and qualifications and progressing into learning post-16.' Pupils at Elmete Central School in Roundhay, Leeds, were allowed to smoke twice a day on school property until the policy was changed after outrage last October. The headteacher had said the policy was aimed at stopping pupils leaving the school premises to smoke. Neighbour Gary Wesley, 58, who lives yards from the school, today said he was 'outraged' that teachers were allowing teenagers to smoke. 'At that age those kids shouldn’t be smoking full stop,' he said. 'When I was at school if you were caught smoking round the back of the bike sheds you’d be sent to detention. 'I wonder whether the teachers are even interested in their health. That should be their top priority. 'I think the teachers just want an easy life.' Hazel Cheeseman, from anti-smoking campaign Ash, said: 'We do understand that many of the young people in referral units are smokers and that managing this is difficult. 'However, we would urge the school to urgently review the policy of allowing smoking in the pupil referral unit. 'We would also encourage them to speak to their local public health team about more appropriate ways to support children who have an addiction to tobacco.'","Students at Honeyhill pupil referral unit given two daily smoking breaks .

Today was officially the hottest day of the year with the mercury rising to a relatively balmy 15.5C in Gravesend in Kent, making it hotter than Rome. What's more, we could see temperatures climbing even higher than this over the weekend, according to the Met Office. The average temperature for March in the UK is 9.8C, but temperatures will reach almost double this over the coming days.

They are clearly making the most of the sunshine – and forecasters say that temperatures are set to soar to 18C (64F). For the first time this year it will be ice cream weather, as parts of Britain will be warmer than Greece. A high pressure system dragging in winds from the southwest means the mercury may climb to double the average March temperature. Forecasts for Sunday put Athens at 10C (50F), Ibiza at 16C (61F) and Istanbul at 7C (45F). The Met Office said: ‘Warmer, drier weather is on the way for parts of the country.

Spring officially starts on March 20, but there are already abundant signs that winter is over. Daffodils and crocuses are in full bloom and spring blossom is on trees across the country. The warmer weather produced a glorious record crop of crocuses in a Berkshire meadow which are descended from flowers brought back to this country by King Richard the Lionheart and his Crusader knights. Back in the depths of winter, the eight-acre field in the village of Inkpen is nothing special - even though it's a nature reserve founded by one of the wealthiest men of the last 100 years. In March, however, it explodes into colour with the flowering of thousands of wild crocuses said to have originated from the reign of King Richard more than 800 years ago. Temperatures reached 12C (54F) in Bournemouth, Dorset, on Wednesday, where people took advantage of clear skies to head to the seafront. The seven-mile promenade was busy with people enjoying the warm weather. John Lee, forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: ‘The weather will be getting much better into the weekend. The south of England will be somewhat drier than we’ve  had recently.

Nine people were evacuated when the three-storey building caught fire in Stockwell, south London, with neighbours calling 999 after spotting smoke billowing from the roof. Four fire engines carrying 21 firefighters rushed to the scene, and although the crews were able to put out the flames they struggled to find the cause of the blaze. 'When we got up into the roof, we were baffled as there were no obvious ignition sources,' said London Fire Brigade investigations officer Matt Cullen. 'No-one had been up to there for a long time and there were no electrics that could have sparked a blaze.' 'We looked everywhere, but the smoking gun was found when we discovered a partially burnt birdsâ€™ nest. 'Neighbours told us they often saw birds flying in and out of a hole in the roof. 'We believe that one of the birds picked up a cigarette butt that was still smouldering and dropped it into the nest, causing it to catch fire and set the roof alight.' Fire crews were called to the block just . after 10.20pm last night and although the roof was damaged by flames, no . one was hurt.

'I grabbed Dylan and just got out of there,' said Ms Monger. 'I didn't stop for one second - my friend from across the way was there screaming ""fire.""

'Luckily for the residents, their neighbours saw the smoke and raised the alarm, so fire crews could get in quickly and bring it under control.'

Clutching a razor-sharp bayonet, the British infantryman peered nervously over the parapet of the First World War trench and into No Man’s Land. Less than 100 yards away was the enemy frontline - conjuring up terrifying images of the hearing the sergeant’s shrill whistle, going ‘over the top’, and risking death charging headlong into a hail of murderous German machine gun fire. But Rifleman Stuart Gray, 35, serving with the 4th Battalion The Rifles, was not preparing to make the ultimate sacrifice, and this was not the Great War. History: Stuart Gray, of 4th Battalion The Rifles, inspects the front line trench of a newly discovered practice WW1 battlefield in Gosport, Hampshire. Historians say it is the best-preserved of its kind ever found . Instead, a century after the start of the bloody 1914-18 conflict, historians have discovered an entire mock battlefield used to train tens of thousands of troops about to deploy to the Western Front. Covering an area the size of 17 football pitches in Gosport, Hampshire, the site contains the remains of two opposing trench systems, each with a 200-metre long frontline, supply trenches and dug-outs, separated by a No Man’s Land. Training: Modern-day soldiers stand in the site, which was only discovered last year by a council employee . Experts say the site, on heathland, is the best preserved example of its kind in the UK. Brave young men from across the UK, Canada and the U.S. would have travelled to the training ground learn how to fight in the mud and cold of the trenches. Instructors would have taught soldiers how to run quickly along the trenches - dug in a zig-zag to reduce the deadly risk of direct hits from shells – go ‘over the top’, put on gas masks and face live fire. Pieces of exploded grenade are still being found at the site. But over the years Browntown Heath became overgrown with gorse bushes and forgotten, used by local people for picnics. Rfl Gray – who has fought in Afghanistan – said standing in the practice trenches had given him an inkling of the conditions endured by his forebears in the infantry. He said: ‘It’s difficult walking up and down the trenches today so to do it in a war would be something else. Going over the top would be pretty scary. I have loads of respect for the guys in the First World War.’ The site was discovered in autumn by Rob Harper, a conservation officer with Gosport Borough Council, who spotted a set of strange lines on an aerial photograph from the 1950s and went to investigate. Mr Harper, 48, said: ‘I found myself walking along a ditch and realised it was part of an elaborate trench system, hidden for all these years by bracken and gorse. I looked around and there were trenches everywhere. It’s quite jaw-dropping. ‘It brings home a sense of loss and emotion. I have five relatives buried on the Western Front. Did any of them train here? So many soldiers must have passed through on their way to sacrifice their lives.’ TV historian Dan Snow, president of the Council for British Archaeology, said: ‘I never thought I would see something this large in the UK. It's an entire replica World War One battlefield. Tens of thousands of soldiers would have trained in the mock battlefield, the size of 17 football pitches. Pictured: Soldiers led by Army reservist Captain Leanne Christmas retrace the steps of those 100 years ago . ‘It shows how seriously Britain took the business of training. They had to send the guys to France ready to do the hardest of tasks, to defeat the German army when they were dug in with deep trenches, artillery, machine guns and they had to break that deadlock. ‘This shows that these guys weren’t just rounded up from industrial towns and carted to the Western front to be chucked at the machineguns. They were learning new tactics and techniques and using new equipment, and this gave them the best chance of success and, ultimately victory. ‘The training experience would have been as realistic as possible: cold, wet, sleep deprivation, dodgy food, people firing live ammunition. It would have got the troops used to all the sounds and smells of battle. But by the end of the war the British Army was the finest in the world.’ Wayne Cocroft, English Heritage’s First World War expert, said: ‘Buildings from Tudor, Georgian, Victorian times…these are all well documented. But the built history of the First World War in England is virtually a blank chapter.’ Experts are now working to map and record the practice battlefield for posterity as well as trying to discover which regiments might have trained there. Battleground: TV historian Dan Snow (left) said: 'It shows how seriously Britain took the business of training' The find marks the start of Home Front Legacy 1914-18, a project on which English Heritage and the Council for British Archaeology (CBA) are working together to document and record key sites on the home front that helped Britain win the First World War. They are trying to identify former drill halls, requisitioned factories and farm buildings, pill boxes, secret listening stations, prisoner-of-war camps and gun emplacements. The aim of the Home Front Legacy 1914-18 campaign is to bring marry national expertise with people’s local knowledge to record the remains of the war in the UK.

Dream job: Brandt Maybury, 31, taste chocolate for a living at Green & Blacks in Westminster, London. The former chef admits he still gorges on chocolate even when his day shift is over . This real life Willy Wonka might have the sweetest job ever – tasting chocolate for a living. Brandt Maybury, 31, from west London, is paid to eat chocolate. Just like the eccentric character from Roald Dahl’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Mr Maybury experiments with weird and wacky new flavours to make the next Green & Black's chocolate bar. But even though Mr Maybury can test up to five chocolate bars a day, the self-confessed chocoholic admits he still feasts on the sweet stuff when he gets home. Mr Maybury – whose favourite Green & Black's flavour is sea salt – is also forced to hit the gym five times a week to shift the extra calories. He also follows a strict diet to make sure he doesn't put on weight – apart from the extra chocolate. Mr Maybury, who started work at the company in March 2013, said: 'The most asked question is: 'Do you get sick of chocolate?' and the answer is 'no'. ‘There are days when we are doing a big tasting session for three or four hours and there is a point where you need to stop, because you can’t have any more. ‘But even on those days, I get home and I might have another bar of chocolate. ‘It’s one of those rare foods that no matter how much you eat you shouldn’t get sick of it. We have 19 different flavours in the range and I’m not sick of any of them.’ As taste assistant for the company, Mr Maybury must taste-test every new bar. In the run-up to Easter, Mr Maybury is busy tasting luxury chocolate eggs and making sure each one is the correct shape and size. Connoisseur: Mr Maybury spends his days cooking up chocolate concoctions in the kitchen (left) and then taste tests all the samples. He says chocolate tasting requires a good palette, just like wine tasting . In a normal day, the former chef can either have a little nibble - or can take part in three-hour long tasting sessions. Like a wine taster, Mr Maybury must be restrained - and hold back from eating the whole lot. He said: 'My friends and family don’t believe it’s a proper job. But they don’t see the hard work and effort I put in. It takes up a lot of time. ‘I think they are all quite jealous but they’re grateful they get a steady supply of chocolate when I go home.’ Mr Maybury also cooks up new ideas for flavours at the Green & Black’s head office in Westminster, London. Some of his less successful creations for the company include a tobacco-flavoured treat. But just like Willy Wonka, Brandt takes pride in his chocolate tasting. He said: ‘It’s all left up to me to come up with the ideas and to go into the kitchen to see if they work. Reflecting: Mr Maybury says he has to think carefully about which flavours might work - and says his tobacco-inspired treat wasn't quite a hit . ‘I always encourage the rest of the team to get involved. You have to have a good palate to taste chocolate. You need to be able to take your time and describe flavours that you are getting. ‘I think when you are tasting chocolate, having a palate that is sensitive is good, as well as a good nose to get the aromas. That’s equally important.’ Mr Maybury also says he is loyal to his own company - and only sometimes tucks into a Cadbury's Dairy Milk or a tub of Roses. Real life Wonka: Mr Maybury's job can be compared to the likes of Willy Wonka from Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, who came up with wacky recipes for sweet treats . Brandt began his course to the foodie’s ultimate job when he took his first job as a chef aged 18. He cooked in various hotels and restaurants, on a yacht in Turkey and at a ski resort in France. He later moved into product development for supermarkets, where he created new recipes for cakes and other sweet items. Chocoholic: Mr Maybury says he still loves all 19 of the company's flavours but his favourite is sea salt . To clinch his role at Green & Black's, Mr Maybury sat through rigorous rounds of chocolate taste tests – similar to wine tasting. But his taste for chocolate meant he beat 3,000 applicants to the job. He said: 'I’ve always been a foodie and I’m passionate about different cuisines and flavours and making flavours come together. 'I do think it’s the best job in the world. With any creative job, it’s putting that hard work and effort in and seeing that product on the shelf - that’s where the satisfaction comes from.' Green & Black’s was set up in 1991 by husband and wife Craig Sams and Josephine Fairley. ‘Green’ represents the ethical sourcing of the cocoa beans and ‘Blacks’ reflects the intensity of the chocolate.","Brandt Maybury, 31, has dream job as real life Willy Wonka .

Mohammed Khurshid Hussain, 23, wrote a 103-character sentence in just 47 seconds after practicing his technique for six hours a day, the International Business Times reported. If confirmed it will smash the previous time of a minute and 33 seconds, set in Dubai in 2008 by an Indian man who used his nose to write the same sentence: 'Guinness World Records has challenged me to to type this sentence using my nose in the fastest time.' Scroll down for video . Smell of success: A media scrum gathered around 23-year-old Mohammed Khurshid Hussain as he set a new world record for typing a sentence using his nose. He said his trick was keeping one eye closed . It took Mr Hussain, from the southern city of Hyderabad, months of training to break through the 53-second barrier after reaching it at least twice. During his attempts the hobbyist, his hands tied behind his back, was surrounded by crowds of fans with stopwatches and an extra-large monitor attached to the keyboard. Videos and ecstatic press conferences after the attempts have been posted on his Youtube feed. Mr Hussain already holds the Guinness World Record for typing the entire English alphabet - although that feat was achieved with his fingers. He achieved a time of 3.43 seconds during the challenge in February 2012, which was held in front of several journalists in a public event his home city. He told the International Business Times: 'If you want to set a record, every millisecond counts. I typed with one eye closed, as it is difficult otherwise to locate the keys.' It is far from the most bizarre typing feat to be recorded by Guinness. Celebration: Onlookers and Mr Hussain cheer during a previous record attempt - the time is now even quicker . Challenge: The record setter used his nose while a crowd watched the results on a large monitor . Last year American Mark Encarnación typed on a smartphone 'The razor-toothed piranhas of the genera Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious freshwater fish in the world. In reality they seldom attack a human' in 25.9 seconds - while blindfolded. There is also a recorded time for typing the numbers 1 to 50 with a full stop between each one. Hind Al Mulla, from the United Arab Emirates, managed the feat in 16.3 seconds at an event in Dubai in 2009. Grace Pak typed a 264-character text on a mobile phone with a keyboard in 56.57 seconds in Pennsylvania, U.S., in 2011, setting another record.

When it comes to 'corporate firefighting' and 'pan-functional team-building', there's only one man for the job - Ian Fletcher, Hugh Bonneville's hilariously incompetent Head of Deliverance in the Olympics comedy Twenty Twelve. And now he's back in a brand new sitcom that will have us falling about with laughter again, even if we haven't got a clue what he's on about. This time, in W1A, he has the bigwigs at Broadcasting House in his sights - or as Hugh puts it, he aims to 'clarify, define, or re-define the core purpose of the BBC across all its functions'. Ian Fletcher arrives at the BBC with his trusty bike in the new comedy W1A . Twenty Twelve, which ran for two series and won a Best Sitcom BAFTA, was a runaway success, sending up the London 2012 Games and the managerial chaos behind them. The show launched to tiny audiences on BBC4 and quickly became a word-of-mouth success, as the understated humour and all-too-believable characters caught on. But after it transferred to BBC2, millions caught up with the running gags about jargon and managerial incompetence. The big-name stars helped - not just Hugh, whose character was in charge of everything from publicity to traffic lights, but Olivia Colman, who played his long-suffering PA and ardent admirer Sally Owen. She was the only efficient person in the Olympic Deliverance HQ and all the work fell on her shoulders, but she was willing to do anything for her beloved boss. Olivia Coleman won a BAFTA for her role as Sally Owen in Twenty Twelve . Her performance won Olivia a BAFTA too, for Best Female Comedy Performance. The show was never expected to have a sequel - 'The clue to that was in the name,' jokes writer and director John Morton. But . it won such acclaim that inevitably some of its central characters have . found themselves in new careers... and where better than the BBC? 'I never expected there to be a sequel to Twenty Twelve, the clue is in the name' John Morton . W1A's premise is simple. Swamped by bad headlines and desperate for the licence fee to be renewed, the governors of the BBC need someone to steady the ship. And of course, since the Olympics were such a success, they bring in Ian Fletcher - unaware of all the behind-the-scenes disasters he'd been embroiled in... or had caused. With a wry smile, Hugh says that the BBC has been offered 'a lot of learning opportunities in recent years' - management-speak for the catalogue of crises that have engulfed the corporation. 'It was only a matter of time before the BBC reached out for a new Head of Values - and Ian was the man for the job,' says Hugh, who promises that his folding bicycle, the perfect symbol for his eco-friendly ethics and ridiculous image, will also make a comeback... even if his character still hasn't mastered the technique of folding it without severing a finger. The first obstacle he encounters when he arrives at Broadcasting House is the BBC's new 'hot-desking' policy that allows anyone to work anywhere, meaning they must lug their laptops around with them too. 'In the first episode, I think the defining message is how to find a desk,' says Hugh. The writer of Twenty Twelve, John Morton, said he never expected to create a sequel . 'Because the wonderful, open-plan, hot-desking principle at the BBC, which really doesn't allow you to sit down for any longer than five minutes, keeps the corporation quite literally on its toes. Ian is very keen to get the message across that his office door is always open, the only downfall being that there is no office.' John Morton, who created both Twenty Twelve and W1A, calls Hugh 'the funniest straight-man actor in Britain. He's consistently funny, even when he's not saying anything. My favourite moments are when another character is talking nonsense and the camera cuts to Hugh. Before he says a line, the comedy effect has been doubled by the expression on his face. The secret lies behind his eyes. Hugh brings a really elusive quality - he's able to give you access to what he must be thinking but not saying.' With the BBC 'brand' set to be such a crucial worldwide asset, they also hire the jargon-spouting PR consultant who handled the Olympics publicity - Siobhan Sharpe (played by Jessica Hynes) who is Ian's biggest nightmare. It's a chance for the characters (who cordially loathe each other) to 're-meet and recalibrate their relationship', as Hugh puts it with a laugh. Siobhan's greatest regret is that she isn't American. She doesn't do lunch, or relationships - they're both for wimps - and when she opens her mouth, verbiage tumbles out. 'If you get bandwidth on this, you've got maple syrup on your waffle at the get-go.' And there are new characters, including a Head of Output with the power to veto any programme, played by Sarah Parish. Sarah's career has been in overdrive for the past year, including a starring role in the Saturday teatime blockbuster Atlantis; in W1A she gets to play a blustering bully called Anna. 'She's this high-powered, frightening, intimidating, very definite person,' explains Sarah. 'When she makes a decision, she makes it. Unfortunately it's always wrong! She's good at talking the talk. When Ian Fletcher arrives, Anna is quite defensive: she's suspicious of him, just in case he actually does know what he's talking about!' Jessica Hynes will return as her character Siobhan in W1A . Real-life BBC executives might be expected to feel more than a little anxious about a satire set in their own offices. But Morton insists the top brass have left the actors to get on with it, and that senior managers have not even asked to see a script, let alone demanded cuts or rewrites. It might ruffle a few feathers, though, he warns. 'This is certainly no love letter to the BBC, but it is a gentle satire. It's benign... even if that's not fashionable.' It's more than just a laugh at the BBC's expense, even though the title is a direct reference to the postcode of Broadcasting House in London, where the series was actually filmed. The cast hope that, as with Twenty Twelve, millions of viewers will spot the resemblance to their own working lives. 'Twenty Twelve was about satirising management structure and management speak,' says Hugh, . 'and all the pitfalls of a team trying to do something en masse when all people are doing is passing the buck. The same flavour is there in W1A - we're not deriding the BBC but we are having an interesting look at the way some decisions are reached. This could quite easily have been set in the NHS or Whitehall.' Ian Bonneville and Jessica Hynes will return to our screens this month in W1A . But the satire neatly skewers the BBC's addiction to jargon and meaningless titles, as executive producer Jon Plowman admits. 'I was asked 20 years ago to be Head of Broken Comedy, which meant non-narrative sketch shows. I said I didn't want to be head of anything broken, so a title had to be invented  - I was made Head of Comedy Entertainment, which then suggested comedy existed that wasn't entertainment.' He took the precaution, before W1A started filming, of confirming with Tony Hall, the director-general, that there were no plans to appoint a real-life Head of Values, and was told the post would remain vacant... at least as long as W1A was on the air. Jon's own title now is Executive Producer. As he defines it, 'The producer's the guy who does the day-to-day work; the executive producer is the guy who gets the credit.' Viewers who missed Twenty Twelve should not expect a glib comedy packed with one-liners. The dialogue in W1A is stuttering: characters start to say something and get bogged down in their own incoherence. 'With comedy there are 100 ways to set up . a situation, and 99 of them simply aren't funny. Finding the right one . is the hardest work imaginable' John Morton . Often they suddenly cut off in mid-sentence, aware that they shouldn't give voice to whatever they're thinking. It's subtle, and all too easy to relate to, with a twinge of embarrassment. But despite the stumbling and the mumbling, there's no improvisation by the cast in W1A - nor was there in Twenty Twelve. Every 'umm' and 'err' is scripted. That puts huge pressure on the actors, because in a scene with five or six people, it only takes one tiny error, one word a second too early, and they have to start again. 'The show might look like it happened to fall together,' Morton says, 'but getting it precisely right take after take is exhausting. And that process continues in the editing suite - comedy focuses on the tiniest of details. With drama you might tell a scene in ten different ways, but with comedy there are 100 ways to set up a situation, and 99 of them simply aren't funny. Finding the right one is the hardest work imaginable - and if it flops, everyone notices.' The question every Twenty Twelve fan will be asking is what's happened to Ian's doting PA Sally (Olivia Colman). Sadly, she isn't returning, though the writer does promise viewers will learn what happened between Sally and Ian on their fateful trip to Italy at the end of the last series. But love, or perhaps a catastrophic office affair, is on the horizon for the BBC's new Head of Values. Whether his career can withstand it is an outcome that, as Ian might say, will be determined following the appraisal of the blue sky interpersonal reassessment session. In other words... wait and see. W1A will air on BBC2 later this month.","The award winning comedy - Twenty Twelve - returns to our screens .

Manuel Pellegrini is targeting another Wembley berth with Manchester City after leading his side to the Capital One Cup trophy last weekend. City beat Sunderland 3-1 in London thanks to stunning goals from Yaya Toure, Samir Nasri and a breakaway finish from Jesus Navas.

Unleash 'The Beast': Alvaro Negredo will be hoping to get back in the goals against Wigan . 'It was our first chance to win a title this year,' Pellegrini told City TV in an exclusive interview. 'It was very important for all the supporters, for the club, for the manager, for the staff, for the players, to win that cup because we deserved it. 'We played six games, we won the six, we scored 22 goals and just conceded two goals. 'It's difficult to believe, playing in Wembley, two teams and none of them are from London. 'Sunderland are in the north and we are in the centre, but you can have the possibility to have the full capacity and have Wembley full. 'Both teams must be proud of their supporters. They had at least 35,000 supporters each.' Giant leap: Costel Pantilimon is drilled and is likely to start for City against Wigan . Hopeful: Fernandinho could make the Brazil World Cup squad after some stellar performances this season . When asked how he celebrated his first trophy in England, Pellegrini said: 'Part of my family was in Wembley, part of my family is living here in Manchester with me. 'I was very happy to celebrate that title in London.' Pellegrini and his star-studded squad were training at the Etihad on Saturday morning ahead of their FA Cup clash with Wigan on Sunday. Fernandinho, who returned to the Brazil squad for the first time in two years in midweek, was delighted with his performance for his country, which was capped by a stunning long-range goal. 'I feel very happy after two years to be back in the Brazil squad and to score a goal, for me, it was an amazing night,' the 29-year-old midfielder said. Game for a laugh: Vincent Kompany and James Milner share a joke as the players go on a jog . Hungry for more: Manuel Pellegrini wants his City side back at Wembley for the FA Cup final . 'I took the ball in the middle and shot from maybe 30 yards. For me it was a very important goal and a beautiful goal.' Luiz Felipe Scolari has a big decision to make when it comes to selecting his Brazil midfield for the World Cup, and Fernandinho remains optimistic his form can earn him a place in the hosts' squad this summer. 'He (Scolari) congratulated me, not just for the goal but for the overall performance,' he said. 'I think we played well but now we need to wait for the final sheet for the World Cup.'

He hadn't done much TV, but he was a big draw on the club circuit. In the early 80s I landed a job on Russ Abbott's Madhouse. Dustin was already working on the show and I'll never forget him walking through the door, all 6ft of him, announcing, 'I come bearing gifts!' even if it was only a bottle of warm Blue Nun wine to welcome me. My then manager, who also looked after Dustin, suggested I move into his flat in London and help with the rent.

Research shows that both sexes prefer the athletic lines of the likes of Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill over the cartoon curves of glamour models. Elegant silhouettes are also more popular than the fuller figure Mad Men’s Christina Hendricks. Research shows that both sexes prefer the athletic lines of the likes of Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill (right) over the fuller figure of Christina Hendricks (left) Plastic surgeons said that fewer patients now think that big is best – and for many they key is for others not to realise they have had surgery. The trend was revealed by implant manufacturer GC Aesthetics, which commissioned a survey of more than 2,000 Britons. Seventy two per cent of the women spoken to said that if they had a breast enlargement, they’d like to go up just one cup size. Miss Ennis-Hill, who won gold in the heptathlon at London 2012, and actress Helen Mirren were among the celebrities whose figures were most envied. Some 22 per cent of the women surveyed felt a two-size increase would be enough and 3 per cent said they’d like to be three cup sizes larger. Just one per cent said they’d like to go up four cup sizes. Kelly Brook's hourglass figure also hit the mark (left), while Helen Mirren (right) was among the celebrities whose figures were most envied . Surprisingly, the men questioned were of a similar opinion. When asked which celebrity’s body they would like their wife or girlfriend to have, they plumped for Miss Ennis-Hill over glamour model Katie Price. They also chose former Countdown host Carol Vorderman over Mad Men’s Christina Hendricks. However, they hadn’t completely fallen out of love with curvaceous women – as Kelly Brook’s hourglass figure also hit the mark. Ayse Kocak, chief executive of GC Aesthetics, which is holding a live web chat today, said results echo sales data, which show a preference for modest increases in size. She added: ‘Today’s women – and even men – seem to prefer a streamlined silhouette and understand that breast augmentation is about gaining confidence, not seeking attention.’ Douglas McGeorge, a former president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said that when plastic surgery was the preserve of the rich and famous, large breast implants were a status symbol. Today, modesty and choosing implants proportionate to a woman’s frame are key. Mr McGeorge, a consultant plastic surgeon in Cheshire, said: ‘The days of trying to squeeze in massive implants and hope that everything is OK are gone. ‘Aesthetic surgery is no longer done by just a minority.  It is done by a lot of people and they don’t necessarily want the world to know what they have done. ‘Some women will always want big breasts but most patients I see just want to look elegant.’ Breast enlargements, which cost around £5,500, are at a record high. Figures from BAAPS show the op to the most popular type of cosmetic surgery, with 11,000 carried out a year. Its members only do around a third of operations, so the true figure is likely to be around 30,000.","The trend was revealed by implant manufacturer GC Aesthetics .

Held back: Graham Stuart said white working-class parents that their children are held back at school because the television is constantly on in their homes . A Conservative MP has told white working-class parents that their children are held back at school because the television is constantly on in their homes. Graham Stuart said that youngsters from poorer families are being overtaken in school by pupils from ethnic minorities because these children worked harder. The privately-educated MP for Beverley and Holderness in the East Riding of Yorkshire said parents should turn off their televisions, blaming a constant stream for stopping children from being able to concentrate on their homework. Mr Stuart is chairman of the Commons education committee, is currently investigating the 'underachievement' of white working-class children, and the reasons behind this - including the impact of their homes and families, and what can be done to improve their educational outcomes. The MP makes his own two children finish their homework before they are allowed to sit down in front of the TV. 'I am not trying to demonise people who leave the telly on if they do not know how damaging it is because no one tells them and [if] they do know know how important two hours' extra homework every fortnight is,' he said, according to the Sunday Times. Mr Stuart added that poor white . children are falling behind some pupils from ethnic minorities, and said . that being able to do homework without the distraction of the . television would help youngsters improve their grades. He . said that children from poor immigrant families, who live in 'dire' housing outperform some disadvantaged British children because they work harder.

However, Mr Stuart's remarks, made as he took evidence as part of the education committee's investigation, were criticised by fellow committee member Labour MP Chris Williamson. The Labour MP for Derby North said that Mr Stuart's views on television demonstrated 'how cut off these privileged members of the Conservative party are'. He added that the children's struggles were down to a lack of opportunity.","Graham Stuart said white youngsters from poor families were being overtaken by children from ethnic minorities .

A study found that people could bank and extra £18,425 during their working life if they abstained from cigarettes, alcohol, chocolate and coffee. Experts say that if they invested this money well, by the time the retired they could have £74,612 in the bank. People could have an extra £75,000 by the time they retire if they gave up their bad habits during Lent . However, the benefits are not just financial. The researchers at AXA say that average alcohol consumption just during Lent adds up to a total of 4,700 calories and that it would take 673 minutes of running to burn this off. They say that chocolate consumption during the same period adds up to an average of 8,100 calories. This means that anyone who is feeling very virtuous and who gives up both chocolate and alcohol during Lent could save themselves 12,804 calories a year. The researchers also say that during Lent people spend an average of £376 pounds on alcohol, cigarettes and chocolate. Those who give up just smoking could save £220 a year while giving up alcohol would add another £78 of savings. If the average Briton gave up chocolate during Lent they would eat 8,100 fewer calories a year . This figure for smoking is worked out on the basis that the average cigarette now costs 40p and the average smoker smokes about 12 cigarettes a day during the 46 days of Lent. Those who are partial to the occasional chocolate bar could have an extra £20 in their bank by the end of Lent each year if they give up the sweet stuff. This figure is worked out on the basis that the average Briton eats about three quarters of a chocolate bar a day. The researchers point out, also, that giving up chocolate can save people money in other ways. For example, eating too much chocolate can rot the teeth meaning giving it up could save people money on dental treatment. A study found that people could bank and extra £18,425 during their working life if they abstained from cigarettes, alcohol, chocolate and coffee . If a person also gave up coffee shop coffees, they could save another £57 during Lent. Andy Zanelli, Head of Retirement Planning, AXA Wealth, said: ‘Small sacrifices, even during the relatively brief 46 day period of Lent, can mean major savings – and these savings can be maximised if invested in appropriate ways, such as through an ISA rather than simply storing savings in a current account, especially at a time of low interest rates. ‘Putting money to one side – even if it means making some sacrifices along the way – is becoming a necessity and, invested prudently, can reap rewards both now and in the future.’ Commenting on the findings, Dr Gary Bolger, Chief Medical Office, AXA PPP healthcare, said: ‘In moderation, little treats – the occasional chocolate bar or a glass of wine – are a part of everyday life and can have a big effect on our happiness and frame of mind. People who give up smoking during Lent could save £220 a year while giving up alcohol would add another £78 of savings each year . ‘The flipside, however, is that over-indulgence can add up to a significant and detrimental impact on the body. ‘The dangers of cigarette smoking are well known and the ideal scenario for anyone’s health is not to smoke at all, but giving up for Lent and proving to yourself that you can cope with not smoking for 46 days, is a fantastic start. ‘There are few of us who are not tempted by the seductive power of a chocolate bar. However, over-indulgence can lead to manifold health problems. ‘Altogether, the average UK adult will consume 12,804 calories from chocolate and alcohol during Lent. Cutting down or cutting out unhealthy habits for a 46 day period can make a difference and, better still, help give individuals confidence to stick with the positive changes they’ve made and live a healthier lifestyle for the rest of the year.’","People could save an extra £18,425 during their working lives if they gave up chocolate, cigarettes, alcohol and coffee during Lent each year .

A sugar tax may have to be imposed on calorie-laden food and drink to tackle the nation's obesity epidemic, the chief medical officer warned yesterday. Dame Sally Davies said that increasing the prices of certain products, particularly fruit juice and fizzy drinks, could be the only way to change the public's poor diet. Being overweight had become 'normalised', with shops altering the dimensions of their clothes so that people do not realise they are getting fatter. Chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies has called for a sugar tax to be imposed on calorie-laden food and drink . Dame Sally said she thought that research 'will find that sugar is addictive', and warned that the crisis is now so severe that today's children will possibly have a lower life expectancy than their parents' generation. The idea that sugar, rather than fat, causes both obesity and diabetes is gaining support among diet and health experts. In January an alliance of doctors and academics described sugar as 'the new tobacco', blaming it for a range of health problems and early death. The typical Briton consumes 12 teaspoons of sugar a day and some adults consume as many as 46. Currently just over a quarter of adults are obese, up from only 8 per cent in 1980. But experts say this figure is expected to more than double by 2050, and there is particular concern about the number of obese children. Dame Sally did not specify how much tax would be added to sweet food and drinks, but experts have previously suggested the rate should be 20 per cent. Addictive: A shopkeeper removes Mars Bars and Snickers Bars from the shelves of her convenience store . Dame Sally said she thought that research 'will find that sugar (pictured here) is addictive . This would mean a Mars Bar would go up from 60p to 72p, a can of coke from 70p to 84p and a carton of fruit juice from £1.50 to £1.80 . She also did not go into details about which products would be taxed, but experts have previously stated that a sugar content of 15 per cent is too high. Addressing MPs on the health select committee, Dame Sally, the chief medical officer for England, said: 'What we are comes off our plate – it is calories. So we will need to continue to explore how we can help people to reduce their calories and that gets you in to culture. Nikki Oakley became so addicted to sugar that she consumed the equivalent of 50  teaspoons a day – but she has transformed her life by kicking the habit. The 45-year-old gorged on chocolate biscuits or sugar-laden cereal bars for breakfast, followed by sandwiches, crisps and cakes for lunch and ready meals followed by a pudding in the evening. She shunned tea and coffee during the day in favour of sugary fizzy drinks. Mrs Oakley said her addiction was so severe that she was left in tears, short-tempered, listless and depressed and  suffering from headaches after quitting the 'white stuff' last September. 'It took a fortnight for those feelings to subside,' said the mother of two, from Redditch, Worcestershire. 'It was a cycle – I ate sugary foods as a pick-me-up, but after the high came a low and I would need more. But once I'd got through those first few weeks, I started to feel so much better.' The keen jogger said she was running faster than ever and had lost 18lb. 'I think the science is going such that we will find that sugar is addictive. I don't think we've managed to get over to the public how calorie-packed fruit juices, smoothies and sodas are. 'We need to think about reformulation [changing what's in products], but we also need to have a re-education so that the public know that one's fine but not lots of them. So we may need to move towards some form of sugar tax, but I hope we don't have to.' She also said clothing manufacturers had changed their dress sizes so the public would not realise they were getting fatter. A woman who fitted in to size 14 clothes now would actually have been a size 16 in the 1970s. 'I worry that we have resized women's dress sizes, so we have normalised being overweight,' she said. 'We have to look at a way not of ostracizing people who are obese and making them feel bad about themselves but somehow making them understand and realise this is pathological and will cause them harm.' She also said that today's children could be the first to have lower life expectancies than their parents. The average life expectancy has increased over the generations due to better standards of living and medical advances but obesity threatens to reverse this trend, she said. 'We have generation of children who because of their weight and lack of activity will not live as long as my generation,' she added. 'It will be the first generation that live less. That is of great concern.' In January a report by the National Obesity Forum warned that dire predictions that half the nation will be too fat by 2050 were in fact an underestimate. It said the obesity epidemic could be far worse than predicted because experts did not factor in how much fatter we are getting as we age – and the extent of the problem in children.","Dame Sally Davies said price of some products should be increased .

Not so one PhD student who has taken healthy eating to a whole new level. Peter Bickerton has admitted he eats tens of thousands of insects in a bid to ward off heart disease. Scroll down for video . A slice with lice: Peter Bickerton, 24, a PhD student eats insects in a bid to ward off heart disease. He is pictured with a locust pizza - one of his staple dishes . The 24-year-old has gorged on more than 10,000 crickets, 5,000 locusts and 1,000 waxworms. A typical day for Mr Bickerton consists of freeze-dried locust oatmeal for breakfast, a cricket sandwich for lunch and a plate of waxworm tacos for dinner. Mr Bickerton believes eating insects is the most effective way of preventing high cholesterol and, therefore, heart disease. And the diet is particularly poignant as he has a strong and tragic family history of heart disease. To raise awareness about the health benefits of insect eating, Mr Bickerton gives talks around the world and even hosts bug tasting events to encourage others to sample the tiny critters. Mr Bickerton, from Blackburn, explains that it was a chain of medical scares among his relatives that prompted him to totally transform his diet. Crunchy crickets: Mr Bickerton started researching low cholesterol diets when he discovered that he had a very strong family history of heart disease. He discovered that insects are very low in cholesterol . Tasty grub: On a typical day Mr Bickerton eats freeze-dried locust oatmeal for breakfast, a cricket sandwich for lunch and a plate of waxworm tacos (pictured) for dinner . He said: ‘It all started when my uncle died of a heart attack at the young age of 45. Then a few months later, another one of my uncles suffered a heart attack, needing triple bypass surgery. ‘When my aunt suffered a stroke not long after, my family realised that this was no coincidence and that something much worse was going on. ‘We all had our cholesterol levels tested and my mum and each of her seven siblings were diagnosed with dangerously high levels of cholesterol. ‘Their diagnosis really jolted me. I . was still young and I knew that I had to act now to avoid suffering the . same fate as the rest of my family. ‘Everything . I’ve read points to the fact that eating bugs is the surest way of . avoiding heart disease. It is the healthiest lifestyle out there.’ Mr . Bickerton - who is completing his doctoral research in Plant Sciences . at the University of Manchester - first ate insects on a fieldtrip to . Ecuador in 2009. A maggoty meal: Mr Bickerton has gorged on more than 10,000 crickets, 5,000 locusts and 1,000 waxworms . ‘A native tribe brought some three-inch-long, barbecued beetle larvae for us to try. It was just like an incredible explosion of taste in my mouth, I had never eaten anything like it,’ he said. But it was only in 2011 that Peter started doing more research into insect eating - or ‘entomophagy’. He said: ‘Heart disease is caused by high cholesterol and the only source of cholesterol is saturated fats. Studies show that insects have significantly less saturated fats than other edible animal meat that’s out there. ‘Even if you don’t eat meat, the typical . vegetarian option you’d get in a pub is laden with saturated fats. But . in bugs, it’s negligible. Last summer the World Health Organisation suggested that eating bugs could be the solution to worldwide food shortages. It said insects are a good source of protein and contain a range of minerals. Some beetles, ants, crickets and grasshoppers come close to lean red meat in terms of protein per gram. They can be rich in copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorous, selenium and zinc. They are also a source of fibre and are lower in cholesterol than beef or pork. Crickets are also a course of calcium. ‘Not only that, insects have twice as much protein than beef and far more omega-3 fatty acids than in fish. In fact, research has shown that 100g of locusts for example has more nutrients than other meat.’ These findings led Mr Bickerton to start incorporating bugs into his diet - combining insect protein with the normal meat dishes he ate. He said: ‘The first recipe I ever . created with bugs was by blending beef mince with locusts in a food . processor and making burgers out of them. ‘It took a lot of improvisation but the final product was delicious. The locusts gave the burgers a really nutty aroma. ‘I . started experimenting more with the recipe and a few attempts later, I . was able to make the burgers entirely out of locusts. Soon after, I . decided to entirely cut other meats from my diet.’ Mr . Bickerton began experimenting in the kitchen, rustling up dishes like . locust pizza, waxworm tagine and cricket-filled nut roast. For desert, . he would bake mealworm cakes and puddings. He . said: ‘The trick to cooking bugs is seeing them as you would any other . meat - it’s about looking at a cricket as if it’s a chicken fillet or a . king prawn. ‘You can . whack some locusts in sweet chilli sauce for a stir-fry or stick some . waxworms in pasta sauce to make a bug-Bolognese. It’s simple.’ Since embarking on the insect eating lifestyle, Mr Bickerton claims he has never felt better. Tummy bug: Mr Bickerton said: 'Heart disease is caused by high cholesterol and the only source of cholesterol is saturated fats. Studies show that insects have significantly less saturated fats than other animal meat' He . said: ‘I’m the picture of health now. Before, my weight used to . fluctuate. But as a result of eating bugs which are such a lean meat, . I’ve maintained a healthy weight of 10st 10lbs. ‘My . energy levels have vastly improved too and I believe that’s down to how . insects - like grasshoppers for example - have 10 times more iron than . other meats. ‘I’m only . in my twenties and was lucky to not be diagnosed with high cholesterol . like the rest of my family. A diet rich in bugs is the ultimate . preventive measure.’ Mr . Bickerton admits that in spite of his endorsement of their health . benefits, some of his family and friends are repulsed by his bug . chomping ways: ‘A few of my mates think it’s really weird and will never . accept it. Bug-eyed: Mr Bickerton said: 'The trick to cooking bugs is seeing them as you would any other meat - it's about looking at a cricket as if it's a chicken fillet or a king prawn' ‘My mum meanwhile has made it clear that she will never eat an insect. It doesn’t matter what I do - I could never convince her to try it. ‘It’s a shame. People have this idea that insects are dirty but they are not at all. The livestock we eat are pumped with hormones and drugs. ‘But insects effectively only feed on leaves and you can breed them in a very hygienic warehouse. They are the cleanest and freshest form of meat.’ One person that Mr Bickerton has managed to convert, however, is his girlfriend of six months, Marina, 21. He said: ‘When I first told Marina that I ate bugs, she was intrigued. Then after a night-out, I cooked her some locusts in tomato sauce and she loved it! ‘Now we often eat insects together. For a romantic date, I might make her something special like a roasted butternut squash infused with some locust heads.’ A hive of activity: Mr Bickerton no longer eats any meat or fish other than insects. He is pictured making waxworm tacos for his dinner . Opening up a can of worms: Mr Pickerton (pictured making sweet chilli locusts) says some of his friends have struggled to get their heads around his new diet. But, his girlfriend is happy to join him for an insect burger . Mr Bickerton orders his insects from a live breeder in Somerset and admits their costly retail price in the UK is a downside to the lifestyle. He said: ‘Apart from me, the only other living things who really eat insects in Britain are people’s pet reptiles and birds. So I’ve got to pay premium rates for these bugs - a bag of locusts will set you back around £9. ‘My dream is to eventually have my own insect-growing sanctuary, where I can breed my own crickets, locusts, dung beetles and mealworms to eat.’ Although Mr Bickerton initially began consuming bugs for their health benefits, he admits that now his appetite for insects is insatiable. He said: ‘I get cravings for them - I have to make sure that my freezer is always stocked up with crickets and worms. Lovely locusts: Mr Bickerton says he has never felt better than since he started eating insects . ‘I just love the taste of insects, they’re very pleasant. But it’s their texture which I like the most - that subtle crunch and the squish when you bite through it. ‘My favourite species to eat are locusts. They have an inherently sweet flavour and their heads are really nutty.’ As well as enjoying the taste of bugs, Mr Bickerton also believes that they are a sustainable way of feeding our rapidly expanding global population. He said: ‘The amount of water, grain and resources that you need to rear livestock is ridiculous. ‘The wastage is far less with bugs. If people ate less cow, sheep, pig and chicken and ate more insects instead, everything would balance. For instance, there would be more grain for people who are starving.’","Peter Bickerton has eaten 10,000 crickets, 5,000 locusts, 1,000 waxworms .

The first patient fitted with an artificial heart has died 75 days after his transplant operation in December. The 76-year-old man died on Sunday, according to doctors at the Georges Pompidou European Hospital in Paris. The hospital added that the cause of his death could not be known for sure at this stage. The first patient to be fitted with an artificial heart (pictured) has died 75 days after the transplant operation . When he was fitted with the device, the man was suffering from terminal heart failure, meaning his heart could no longer pump enough blood to sustain his body. He was said to have only a few weeks, or even days, to live. The new heart, made by the French company Carmat, is designed to replace the real heart for as much as five years by mimicking nature's work. It is implanted into the chest and weighs about three times as much as a real heart – it weighs 2lbs. The 76-year-old man had just days to live because of terminal heart failure before he was fitted with the artificial heart. Image shows Alain Carpentier, a leading French heart transplant specialist who was involved in the operation . The device mimics heart muscle contractions and contains sensors that adapt the blood flow to the patient's moves. The artificial heart is powered by external, wearable lithium-ion batteries. Inside the heart, surfaces that come into contact with human blood are made partly from bovine tissue instead of synthetic materials, such as plastic, that can cause blood clots. It aims to help the thousands of patients who die each year while awaiting a donor. ‘Carmat wishes to pay tribute to the courage and the pioneering role of this patient and his family, as well as the medical team's dedication,’ a company spokeswoman said after the first patient’s death. She stressed that it was premature to draw any conclusions on Carmat's artificial heart at this stage. Three more patients in France with terminal heart failure are due to be fitted with the device. The clinical trial will be considered a success if the patients survive with the implant for at least a month. If it passes the test, Carmat has said it would fit the device into about 20 patients with less severe heart failure. ‘The doctors directly involved in the post-surgical care wish to highlight the value of the lessons learned from this first clinical trial, with regard to the selection of the patient, his surveillance, the prevention and treatment of difficulties encountered,’ the hospital said in a statement. The device is designed to replace a failing heart for up to five years. It is implanted into the chest and weighs about three times as much as a real heart – it weighs 2lbs. It mimics heart muscle contractions and contains sensors that adapt the blood flow to the patient's moves. The artificial heart is powered by external, wearable lithium-ion batteries. Inside . the heart, surfaces that come into contact with human blood are made . partly from bovine tissue instead of synthetic materials . that can cause blood clots. It aims to help the thousands of patients who die each year while awaiting a donor. An in-depth analysis of the medical and technical data gathered since the first patient's operation will be needed to establish the cause of his death, the hospital added. Carmat estimates around 100,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe could benefit from its artificial heart, a market worth more than 16 billion euros (£13 billion). Among Carmat's competitors for artificial heart implants are privately-held SynCardia Systems and Abiomed, both of the U.S. SynCardia's artificial heart is the only one approved both in the United States and the European Union and has been implanted in more than 1,200 patients to keep them waiting for a heart from a matching donor. The longest a patient has lived with the device is just under four years prior to a transplant. Carmat's heart is designed to serve not as a bridge to transplant but as a permanent implant, extending life for terminally ill patients who cannot hope for a real organ, generally because they are too old and donors too scarce.","The 76-year-old man died on Sunday - 75 days after having surgery in Paris .

Remorse: Sir David Nicholson has spoken of his 'bitter regret' over not speaking to patients and their families affected during the Stafford Hospital scandal . Outgoing NHS boss Sir David Nicholson has spoken of his 'bitter regret' over not speaking to patients and their families who were so badly treated during the Stafford Hospital scandal. NHS England’s chief executive admitted his response to the Mid Stafforshire report – which revealed serious and systematic failures in care - had been one of the hardest lessons he learned during his 36-year career with the NHS. Sir David said not talking to campaigners and other patients was his 'biggest mistake' of his service. He avoided speaking to those affected because he did not want to be embroiled in a media circus - something he now says was the 'wrong call'. Sir David, who came under intense scrutiny for his role in the fiasco, spoke candidly and at length about his role in the scandal at a health care conference in Manchester. With just 27 days left in his post, Sir David spoke about a visit to the troubled hospital after a damning report into Stafford Hospital was published in 2009. He told delegates at the Health and Care Innovation Expo in Manchester: 'The biggest and most obvious mistake that I made was when it became clear when the Health Care Commission reported on Mid Staffordshire. 'I went to the hospital and I didn't seek out the patients representatives and the people who were in Cure The NHS, and I didn't do it because I made the wrong call. 'At the time, Andy Burnham had been out and it had been turned into a media circus and I judged I didn't want to be involved in a media circus and I was wrong, I was absolutely wrong. 'Because one of the things I leaned, and I have determinedly done it since then, is that there is no shortcut to understanding and talking to patients and relatives and people, there is no shortcut to it. 'I didn't do it and then I got myself into a tangle of talking to people through the media, and that continues to be a very bad thing. But Julie Bailey, who set up the campaign group Cure the NHS after her mother Bella died at the hospital, said Sir David had 'ample opportunity' to speak to the campaign group but never chose to do so . 'That was a mistake that I made that I bitterly, bitterly regret.' But Julie Bailey, who set up the campaign . group Cure the NHS after her mother Bella died at the hospital, said . that Sir David had 'ample opportunity' to speak to the campaign group . but never chose to do so. 'It . is very easy to say when he is leaving and looking for a consultancy . role,' she said. 'He had ample opportunity to come and meet us. 'Andy Burnham did not come to meet us and it was not a media circus.' Despite his regrets, Sir David insisted he was right not to resign at the time. Defiant: Despite his regrets, Sir David insisted today he was right not to resign at the time . He said: 'I’ve had some uncomfortable moments over all this. And if people and families of patients want to have a go at me, I accept that and will take it. 'But I decided to stay as I thought there was a danger the fallout from Mid Staffordshire could turn very horrible for the NHS overall, when we could use the report to make positive changes. 'I thought it would be irresponsible to wander off at that moment. But I am a human being and you cannot read the stuff about people being injured and harmed without being upset. I accept I made some mistakes in all that.” In the past, Sir David said that part of his decision to stand down was driven by 'becoming the story' in the wake of the scandal. Mid Staffordshire was the focus of one of the biggest scandals in the history of the NHS. Inquiries into the scandal revealed that hundreds more people died at the trust than would have been expected. Some patients were left lying in urine and excrement for days, forced to drink water out of vases or given the wrong medication. The . 2009 investigation by the Healthcare Commission found that between 400 . and 1,200 more people died at the trust than would have been expected. And . Robert Francis QC, chair of the public inquiry, highlighted the 'appalling and unnecessary suffering' of hundreds of patients. The trust was recently dissolved and key services will move to neighbouring hospitals. Campaigners called for Sir David to be sacked after the publication of the public inquiry report into Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. He was in charge of the regional . health authority responsible for the trust for a short period while . patients were being mistreated. Speaking . about his short tenure in the Midlands, Sir David said: 'This is a hard . conversation to have because whatever you say you sound defensive. Campaigners called for Sir David to be sacked after the publication of the public inquiry report into Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. 'I was the chief executive of the Birmingham and Black Country Strategic Health Authority, a pretty successful strategic health authority in lots of ways, and I was asked to take on the responsibilities for Shropshire and Staffordshire Strategic Health Authority and West Midlands South, as well as my job. I did each of them on one day a week. 'It was just closing them down because there had already been the decision made to reorganise them. 'Clearly I should have done more and I don't deny any of that at all. 'I worked in Birmingham and Black Country for thee years and about eight months in the rest of the West Midlands. 'With hindsight now, we should have taken more action quicker.'","Sir David Nicholson said today that not talking to campaigners and other patients was his 'biggest mistake' during his 36 years of service in the NHS .

He . added: 'I started fishing with friends when I was seven - we would go . to a bridge in the town with a rod and reel and be happy to catch . whatever swam past. 'When I got older I joined an angling club, bought better equipment and took it quite seriously, going on fishing holidays. 'It's now a joy to be able to do it full-time.

'Crufts is ultimately a celebration of all dogs. It celebrates working dogs, which are fit and healthy enough to perform the jobs for which they were originally bred, such as those in the Gamekeeper classes or which line up for the Police Dog Team Operational and Humanitarian Action of the Year award, and it hails hero dogs through the Friends for Life competition. 'Rescue dogs are celebrated in the rescue dog agility competition and the speed and agility of dogs is celebrated in the ever-popular competitions of Flyball and Heelwork to Music.'

It marks a victory for the Daily Mail’s ‘Make the Banks Lend’ campaign launched in July 2010 to highlight the plight of small firms, which need money to grow. The Competition and Markets Authority will look into banks' failure to lend to small businesses (library image) The OFT began a review of small business lending last year, amid concerns that healthy firms were being starved of credit. Banking industry insiders confirmed yesterday that it had found sufficient evidence of wrongdoing to recommend a full-scale inquiry by the CMA. The investigation will pile more pressure on the High Street giants. About £42billion of cheap money has been made available in lending schemes over the past 18 months but although households have benefited from cheap mortgages, lending to small firms continues to fall. Between April 1 and December 31 last year, firms made repayments that totalled £1.32billion more than they received in loans.","New Competition and Markets Authority to undertake probe into banks .

Revelation: Women with breast cancer said they felt healthier after stretching and meditating . Yoga may improve the lives of breast cancer patients, a study has found. Researchers say practising it can control stress and improve the wellbeing of women having radiation treatment. Simple stretching exercises were able to lessen fatigue, the study showed. But – when stretching was combined with the breathing, meditation and relaxation techniques used in yoga – breast cancer patients also felt healthier and more relaxed. Lorenzo Cohen, a professor who led the research at the University of Texas, said that combining mind and body practices had ‘tremendous potential’. The study, which was reported in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, split 191 women with breast cancer into three groups: yoga, simple stretching and neither. Women who practised yoga had the steepest fall in their cortisol levels, suggesting yoga helped regulate the stress hormone. Dr Cohen said: 'Combining mind and body practices that are part of yoga clearly have tremendous potential to help patients manage the psycho-social and physical difficulties associated with treatment and life after cancer, beyond the benefits of simple stretching.' To conduct the study, 191 women with breast cancer were split into three groups - yoga; simple stretching; or no instruction in yoga or stretching. Participants in the yoga and stretching groups attended sessions specifically tailored to breast cancer patients for one-hour, three days a week throughout their six weeks of radiation treatment. They were asked to report on their quality of life, including levels of fatigue and depression, their daily functioning and a measure assessing ability to find meaning in the illness experience. Saliva samples were collected and electrocardiogram tests were also administered throughout and after the course of treatment. Doctors at the University of Texas will now research what poses and techniques in yoga work . Dr Cohen said the research shows that developing a yoga practice also helps patients after completing cancer treatment. He added: 'The transition from active therapy back to everyday life can be very stressful as patients no longer receive the same level of medical care and attention. 'Teaching patients a mind-body technique like yoga as a coping skill can make the transition less difficult.' Dr Cohen and his team are now conducting a clinical trial in women with breast cancer to further determine the mechanisms of yoga that lead to improvement in physical functioning, quality of life and biological outcomes during and after radiation treatment.","Stretching helped lessen fatigue, meditation made patients feel healthy .

A devastated mother has described the moment she smothered her son who was suffering from a terminal genetic disease. Heather Pratten's son Nigel Goodman had Huntington's disease - a condition which had also killed his father Kenneth. While his brother Philip also suffered with the condition, Nigel had never come to terms with his diagnosis, Heather said. Heather Pratten's son Nigel Goodman had advanced Huntington's disease. She helped him take his own life by smothering him after he took a heroin overdose . Speaking on ITV's This Morning, she explained how on his 42nd birthday, Nigel had tried to take his life with a massive heroin overdose. Lying next to him and seeing him struggling to breathe as the drug took hold, she took a pillow and suffocated him to relieve his suffering. She told hosts Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield: 'I thought ""this has to end"". I couldn't take it any longer. I put a pillow over his face. When I took it away, he was gone.' Although she was arrested and charged, an autopsy concluded her actions would not have changed Nigel's fate. She was initially charged with murder, but eventually pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting suicide.A judge later ruled during her hearing in October 2000 that the case was an 'exceptional circumstance' and she was given a conditional discharge. Nigel had never come to terms with his diagnosis, his mother said. On his 47th birthday he tried to take his own life . Heather has campaigned for a change in the . law ever since Nigel's death in March 2000. Her story features . in an emotive new book: Assisted Dying: Who Makes The Final Decision?, published tomorrow. Huntington's disease is an incurable disease caused by an inherited faulty gene. This gene produces a protein called Huntingtin. It's not known how, but the gene causes widespread damage to the nerve cells in the brain, causing a range of symptoms. Sufferers can exhibit emotional and mental changes such as mood swings, clumsiness, lack of motivation, aggression and depression which, in the early stages, can often be written off as simple personality traits. Later, they develop physical problems such as the shakes or nervous tics, then weight loss and muscle weakness which leaves the patient unable to swallow, speak or move. Every sufferer has a different rate of deterioration, but it is a fatal condition. Heather, who had five children, says she knew to be aware of the disease because her husband Kenneth had also suffered from it. The couple had married in 1955 and had five ­children – Nigel, Philip, Stephen, Tina and Deborah – and raised them in Hornchurch, East London. Then in his thirties, Kenneth became absent minded, would leave taps on and cigarettes lit in strange places, recalls Heather. 'It turned out his father had also had Huntington's, but his mother had never told him. We were told he had died of a nervous breakdown.' Kenneth died at the age of 44 of a heart attack - and Heather began to worry if the devastating disease would present itself in any of her children. A judge later ruled during Heather's hearing that the case was an exceptional circumstance and she was given a conditional discharge . 'I told them not to have children in case they passed it on and to make the best of their lives.' Her son Philip was diagnosed in his 30s and was accepting of the condition, she says. 'He was never very independently minded and we found him a place in one of the best care homes in the country for Huntington's - he really settled there.' Philip later died, aged 48, having been confined to a wheelchair. But for his brother Nigel, things were very different - and Heather says she clearly remembers the day she realised he too had the disease.

In adults the symptoms usually appear between 35 and 50, although . until a blood test was introduced around 20 years ago, it was very . difficult to diagnose it at an early stage. She told This Morning: 'Nigel loved to draw cards and I would always receive a hand-drawn birthday and Christmas card. 'Then one day he got me a shop-bought card - and I just knew. He couldn't draw any more. He had Huntington's.' Unlike Philip, Nigel wanted to shut himself off from the world, preferring to stay in his flat. 'He then said he wouldn't live with the disease, he was going away to Scotland and not to contact him. 'I was very worried as I knew he was having difficulty getting on trains. 'I kept phoning and phoning him and finally he picked up and just said, ""help me, I'm scared"". 'I went to see him and he'd been trying to starve himself and had bought vodka to try and keep himself unconscious. 'He wanted me to buy him more vodka. Instead, I called an ambulance - he was furious.' Then on Nigel's 42nd birthday, Heather went to his flat to take him out. 'We went out, but then he said he wanted to go back to the flat. I saw no reason not to.' Back home, Nigel turned to his mother and said: 'My friends have got me what I needed.' He left the room and came back holding a small pack of heroin and a syringe. 'It was the day he had chosen to die,' says Heather. 'He said he'd already tried to take his life twice in front of a train, but could only think of the driver. 'He'd also thought of hanging himself. 'I saw the heroin and thought ""that is the best way for him to go"". The pair then lay down, Nigel took the drug and they lay there chatting, she recalls. Despair: Heather told hosts Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield she couldn't take Nigel's suffering any more. 'I put a pillow over his face. When I took it away, he was gone' 'Then we fell asleep and when I woke up, I could tell he was nearly gone. His face was white, his lips were blue and he was barely breathing. 'I thought ""this has to end"". I couldn't take it any longer. I put a pillow over his face. When I took it away, he was gone.' Heather spent half an hour with Nigel before calling the police and explaining everything that had happened. 'It's not something I could keep inside,' she told Holly and Philip. 'I knew I could get 14 years but at that point, I was just worried about my family.' Strong: Heather has campaigned for a change in the law ever since Nigel's death. Her story features in an emotive new book . She was conditionally discharged for a year. Judge Graham Boal told her: 'Your story is one that would move the hardest of hearts.' Since then, Heather has campaigned for dignity in dying and a chance to the law. Her story features . in an emotive new book. Assisted Dying: Who Makes The Final Decision?, published tomorrow.

The smartphone camera captures a barcode-type logo on compatible adverts, which automatically link to the advertiser's store.

British tech firm Powa Technologies has already signed up 240 global brands from Adidas and Reebok, to Universal Music and the world’s second largest supermarket group, Carrefour. It is the brainchild of internet entrepreneur and one-time City whizz-kid, Dan Wagner, who has become a multi-millionaire on the back of past investments in a series of tech firms. The 50-year-old, who was brought up in London, has something of a reputation as a flamboyant and successful salesman rather than a tech geek. He met his wife, Susan, who was working as a model in Japan, by pretending to be journalist from The Face magazine who was writing a feature. Wagner said: ‘It's not normal for a British company to say that we'll be the best at something, not in technology. But we have built the first British true internet sensation. This is Britain’s first potential Google or Facebook. ‘We're going to beat the Americans at this. We're going to beat everyone at this.’ If a user was near a coffee shop, for example, they might be sent a voucher for a cappuccino or they could be sent details of a credit card offer when near a bank. While browsing a magazine, the reader could also use the photo to purchase the product, mock-up pictured . The company raised £60million to develop and launch the service after showcasing the technology to investors in the USA. It was the single biggest investment in any start-up tech company in 2013. The father of two, who left school at 16, believes the technology will be generating sales totalling hundreds of millions of pounds by next year. It uses both the eyes and the ears of smartphones, like Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy, that have become essentials of modern life. The handset microphones can capture a so-called Audiotag on radio commercials, which will then provide links to a store and product. Wagner’s Powa Technologies is launching the new technology in New York and London, while the firm has also opened offices in 12 other countries . British tech firm Powa Technologies, owned by Dan Wagner, pictured, has already signed up 240 brands including Adidas, Universal Music and supermarket group Carrefour . It makes its money by taking a small fee, typically 25p or 0.1 per cent of the price paid for the item, whichever is the greater. The app and smartphone technology also lets retailers target consumers with specific offers that are sent direct to their handsets. High street beacons monitor the movements of shoppers signed up to its service via the phone and Bluetooth radio transmissions. If they are near a coffee shop, for example, they might be sent a voucher for a cappuccino or they could be sent details of a credit card offer when near a bank. The offers would be tailored to the individual’s tastes, and based on their purchase history. While the company is selling the technology as a way to help shoppers, privacy consumers may be concerned about the tracking function and creation of personal profiles. However, this seems unlikely to hold back the innovation in Britain, where shoppers have shown enormous enthusiasm for hi-tech shopping.  Spending on web shopping in this country is already the highest in the world at an annual average of £1,175 per head. PowaTag has signed up 35 large charities who will be able to use the services free of charge. People will be able to donate to TV and radio appeals instantly without paying handling fees. Speaking today at the worldwide launch of PowaTag in New York, Mr Wagner said companies currently lose sales because consumers are simply unable to make a purchase when they see an ad. His technology turns this impulse to buy into a sale. ‘The retail sector is being forced to respond to growing market pressures from customers wanting greater levels of control and freedom of access and choice on how they purchase goods,’ he said. ‘Retailers can no longer afford to think in terms of online verses offline – they must seriously rethink how they connect in-store and online strategies. ‘Our hybrid combination of technologies which include Bluetooth beacons, instant payment authentication and mobility enable retailers to have a richer engagement with their customers and understand their needs and cater for them in a more focused way. ‘Consumers also benefit from having a vastly improved shopping experience.’ The E-commerce director at Universal, Stephen Partridge, backed the technology, saying: ‘PowaTag will transform the way fans access and purchase music and merchandise from their favourite artists, both online and in the real world.’","Powatag lets shoppers buy products by pointing their phone at adverts .

A British man has become the second patient in a Europe to have pioneering stem cell treatment in a bid to prolong his life. Jesse Freeman, 71, was invited to take part in the landmark trial after suffering a major heart attack at home. Cardiologists repaired a blocked artery and inserted a stent to keep it open after he was rushed to hospital. Jesse Freeman (pictured with his wife, Christine) has become the second person in Europe to have pioneering stem cell treatment after a heart attack. It is hoped the procedure will cause his damaged heart muscle to regenerate and that it could eventually become common practice in the treatment of heart attack patients . But while recovering in hospital, he was asked to take part in the major new study to see if heart attack patients can benefit from being treated with their own stem cells. These are 'master cells' which can turn into almost any other type of cell in the body, replacing damaged cells. Doctors at the London Chest Hospital, in Bethnal Green, removed bone marrow from Mr Freeman, a grandfather, without general anaesthetic and the cells were then infused into his heart. Mr Freeman, a chauffeur, had bone marrow  extracted from his hip before it was 'purified' in a stem cell laboratory. This allowed the stem cells to be separated from the serum also found in bone marrow. He then had the stem cells injected into his major coronary arteries from where they infused into his heart muscle. It is hoped this will help his damaged heart muscle regenerate. Mr Freeman was treated at The London Chest Hospital (pictured) and will continue to receive check-ups for five years as doctors study the effect of the stem cell treatment . He will now continue to have check-ups for five years in a bid to see how the treatment affects the health of his heart. He told MailOnline: 'When I heard about the trial I thought it was a good idea. It was explained to me and I could see where they were coming from, so I hoped some good would come of it. At least they've tried. 'I thought: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.' He added: 'I feel fantastic in . myself. Most people wouldn't believe I've had a heart attack. I think . I've been very lucky and I hope the procedure does what they are . hoping it will do.' Within a few days of receiving the stem cells, Mr Freeman had recovered from the procedure and was able to leave hospital. Mr Freeman had some of his own bone marrow harvested from his hip. The stem cells were then removed from the bone marrow in a specialist lab. The stem cells were then injected into his coronary arteries from where they infused into his heart muscle. It is hoped this will cause the damaged heart muscle to regenerate. Stem cells are the body’s master cells which can turn into almost any other type of cell in the body, replacing damaged cells. Using the patient's own stem cells means the chance of them being rejected is much lower. Mr Freeman will have check-ups for five years and his progress will be compared to that of other heart attack patients. If the procedure prove to be successful, it could become standard practice in the treatment of heart attack patients. Mr Freeman's progress will now be monitored and compared with that of other heart attack victims who have not had the treatment. Medical experts hope that, by using his own stem cells, the risk of rejection is greatly reduced and it will speed his recovery. It is hoped the treatment will increase survival rates among heart patients by at least 25 per cent if carried out within five days of a heart attack. The 5.9 million euro trial is taking place in Britain and nine other European countries and is funded by the European Commission. Mr Freeman, from Romford, Essex, said he had been told by doctors that he was a perfect candidate for the research as only 45 per cent of his heart was working. Mr Freeman, who is married to Christine, 67, said: ‘My hope is that the cells will regenerate and give me ability and a normal life cycle. ‘I feel damn lucky - the stem cell surgery could not have happened at a better time. ‘I am grateful to be part of a pioneering programme.’ He added: 'I think this is the way of the future - I am happy to be in on it. The trial is being carried out by Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs the London Chest Hospital, in conjunction with Queen Mary, University of London and University College London. Altogether 3,000 patients across Europe will be taking part in the pilot scheme. Consultant cardiologist Professor Anthony Mathur said: ‘The study is the biggest and most comprehensive trial of its kind in the world and follows successful trials, funded by The Heart Cells Foundation. Mr Freeman told MailOnline that he was very happy to take part in the trial in the hope it will help future patients. He said it was 'no skin off my nose' but that it could lead to real benefits . ‘It has taken two years to get to the point where we are ready to accept patients, but we have now reached that stage and we are all very excited. ‘Our studies will tell us if adult stem cells from bone marrow can repair damaged hearts and, if so, how these cells should be administered to patients. ‘Stem cells are the body’s master cells which can turn into almost any other type of cell in the body, replacing damaged cells. 'This study will determine if adult stem cells can save lives in heart attack patients across Europe.' Professor John Martin, from University College London, added: 'This trial brings together a powerful partnership of European doctors and scientists to solve a fundamental problem of importance to all people. 'It will give an answer about whether adult multi-potential stem cells in their natural environment can treat human disease.'","Jesse Freeman, 71, suffered a major heart attack at home .

These artworks are so beautiful you may be forgiven for thinking they’ve been meticulously painted by hand. In fact they are the result of a computer algorithm and contain up to almost 17 million different colours, with each pixel being a different colour to the one next to it. Called ‘rainbow smoke’, the designs and software were created by Hungarian programmer Jozsef Fejes as part of an online competition. An online contest, set up by Programming Puzzles and Code Golf Stack Exchange recently challenged coders to create images where every pixel was a different colour. It was won by Hungarian Jozsef Fejes for his algorithm that created 'rainbow smoke' designs, pictured . The contest was set up by Programming Puzzles and Code Golf Stack Exchange. It challenged coders to create images where each pixel was a unique colour, with no colours being repeated and no colours missing. The images had to be created using just algorithms, cover at least 256 x 128 pixels and use all the 15-bit RGB system - a total of 32,768 individual hues. However, coders could make larger pictures if they wanted to. A pixel in the RGB system is made up of three bytes for red, green and blue. This is where the name 'RGB' comes from. Each colour then has different intensity levels of green, blue and red light. Fejes' images began using the 15-bit RGB colours, but his algorithm was also capable of creating up to 24-bit RGB images, which contain a total of 16,777,216 colours. Each image, or range of images, were then put to a public vote, which Fejes, also known as fejescoco, won with 144 votes. The images had to be created using just algorithms, cover at least 256 x 128 pixels and use all the colours in RGB 24-bit images - up to 16,777,216 colours. Each colour in a pixel is made up of different intensity levels of green, blue and red light, for example . Fejes' final full-size pieces cover 4096 x 4096 pixels. The images pictured are compressed so don't display all the colours. The view also varies depending on the number of pixels a screen can handle - for example, it will look different on a phone to a laptop to a high-definition TV . Fejes’ program works by plotting a single colour before placing a similar colour next to it, based on intensity levels of light in each colour. In some of his images, the program picked a colour at random, in others the program plotted all the variations of reds, oranges, yellows, and so on, in sequence. ‘At first I didn't really know if it was going to end up looking beautiful or not, it was just an interesting programming challenge for me,’ Fejes told New Scientist. ‘I was very surprised at how beautiful it turned out to be.’ Fejes' winning program plots single colours before placing similar colours next to them, based on intensity levels of light in each colour.

Walkers can easily get lost in the Brecon Beacons even with the help of modern gadgets and GPS systems. And it seems prehistoric man also struggled to find his way around the Welsh mountainside as archaeologists have stumbled across a 4,000-year-old signpost. The Bronze Age rock art is the first of its kind to be found in the Brecon Beacons and its exact location is being kept secret to protect the site. A Bronze Age Sat-Nav? The rock art is the first of its kind to be found in the Brecon Beacons and its exact location is being kept secret to protect the site . The 4,000-year-old signpost lies in a secret location in the Brecon Beacons, south Wales. It is the first of its kind to be found in Wales, which is rich in Bronze Age sites. Experts claim prehistoric stone served as a way marker for primitive farming communities who lived in isolated farms which were just one or two small round houses of timber and stone - or in small villages of up to 30 people. The stone is marked with 12 cup marks to denote the area's geography. Cup marks were the most common later prehistoric rock art form in Britain and Europe, but their occurrence in mid Wales is rare. Although the rock, which has many . markings of different shapes and sizes in it, now lies flat, scientists . believe it stood up in the past and would have been used as a way marker . for farmers. The ancient standing stone has 12 hollow cup marks cut into the rock face to help travellers navigate the landscape thousands of years ago. The small wells are thought to have acted as markers for geographical features in the surrounding landscape to help people regain their bearings. Geologist Alan Bowring came across the ancient signpost last year while working on land owned by the National Trust. ‘I often find myself working and walking in remote locations and encountering hidden features in the landscape of south and mid Wales that few others will have seen,’ he said.

The Bronze Age rock art is the first of its kind to be found in the Brecon Beacons (marked) ‘But this chance discovery appears to be significant in our understanding of human cultural history in the region.’ Sensing it was unusual, he sought advice from national park archaeologist Natalie Ward, who has experience of recording similar artefacts in the north of England. Miss Ward said the discovery of the ancient marker was a ‘unique find’ in Wales. ‘There are lots of other rock art sites in Britain but they are mainly in Scotland and North England,’ she said. ‘But this particular formation with cut marks that are joined by connecting lines - there are only a handful of these sites in Wales. ‘The fact this could have once been an upright standing stone would make it unique in Wales.’ The National Trust’s own archaeological survey had already highlighted Bronze Age features in the area.

'I often find myself working and walking in remote locations, and encountering hidden features in the landscape of south and mid Wales that few others will have seen,' he said . From the archaeological evidence available, cattle were the most important animals kept and barley and wheat the most important crops. Dr George Nash of the University of Bristol confirmed the standing stone is the first prehistoric rock engraved panel recorded in the Brecon Beacons. Dr Nash said that based on the shape of the stone and its engravings it was probably carved in the early to middle Bronze Age period, between 2,500 BC and 1,500 BC. Bronze Age farming communities lived in isolated farms which were just one or two small round houses of timber and stone - or in small villages of up to 30 people.  An illustration of a larger village in the Outer Hebridean Western Isles is pictured . ‘We might have been able to predict a discovery of this kind considering the large amount of prehistoric ritual sites in the Brecon Beacons, but this is the first evidence of prehistoric rock art to be ever recorded here,’ he said. ‘There are no other later prehistoric standing stones within this part of Wales that are cup marked, making this one rather unique.’ He said the cup marks were the most common later prehistoric rock art form in Britain and Europe, but their occurrence in mid Wales is rare. There are many Bronze Age sites in Wales.

Engineers from Massachusetts-based Terrafugia will discuss how they designed and developed the Transition flying car, pictured, set to go on sale in 2015. The online event is being hosted by Nasa and will begin at 1pm EST (6pm GMT) today . The Transition can reach speeds of around 70 miles . per hour on the road and 115 in the air. It flies using a 23-gallon tank of automotive fuel and burns 5 . gallons per hour in the air. On the ground, it gets 35 miles per gallon. The Transition has rear-wheel drive when on the road. It comes with two passenger airbags, and a full-vehicle parachute. The flying car is 2m tall, 2.3m wide and 6m long with a wingspan of 8m. The Transition vehicle is part-sedan, part-private jet and is due to go on sale as early as 2015, although it may be released in 2016. It has been in . development for seven years and during flight testing in 2012, it . successfully flew for eight minutes. The vehicle was then driven around the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh air show in July before . transitioning into the jet and taking off on two 20-minute flight . demonstrations. The Terrafugia has two seats, four wheels and wings that fold up so it can be driven . like a car. It can carry two people, including the pilot, plus luggage and runs on unleaded petrol. In a statement, the company said: 'Developing a practical vehicle that simultaneously satisfies road and aircraft regulations to become a true 'flying car' presents significant engineering challenges. 'Yet this is what the team at Terrafugia has achieved with their proof-of-concept vehicle, which has been flying and driving for the past 2 years. 'In the webinar, Terrafugia will discuss the design process for the composite structure of the Transition airframe and the role and benefits of physics based simulation.' In a statement, the company said: 'In the webinar, Terrafugia will discuss the design process for the composite structure of the Transition airframe and the role and benefits of physics based simulation' Phil Meteer, Terrafugia's Chief Test Pilot and Flight Test Coordinator is pictured driving the Transition vehicle. The part-sedan, part- private jet has been in development for seven years and is still going through tests need to achieve federal certification . Terrafugia has already pushed back the launch once. In 2012, the company said it would have to delay deliveries . due to design challenges and problems with parts suppliers. Transition is considered to be a light sports plane by the U.S Federal Aviation Administration, as well as being a road car. Owners will have to have pilot's licenses, and will need to . pass a test, plus complete 20 hours of flying time to be able to fly the car. The Transition made its first public flights, pictured, soaring for a total of 40 minutes over the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh aviation show in Wisconsin in July . The Transition, pictured, can reach speeds of around 70 miles per hour on the road and 115 in the air. It flies using a 23-gallon tank of automotive fuel and burns 5 gallons per hour in the air.

It has wings that fold up so it can be driven like a car and can carry luggage. The vehicle runs on unleaded petrol . Despite . the advances in technology the Transition demonstrates, critics have . said that it is still not the vision of flying cars seen in many sci-fi . films. To answer these critics, Terrafugia also released designs for a TF-X Model of its Transition range in May last year. The TF-X model will be small enough to fit in a garage and won't need a runway to take off. Whereas the Transition requires a . runway, the TF-X can take off from a vertical position because of . motorised rotors on the wings. This shot was taken by a camera fixed to one of the Transition's wing during its public flight over Wisconsin. The 20-minute demonstrations included flight manoeuvres over the show centre, converting from airplane to car, and driving along the flight line . The Transition flying car, built by Terrafugia, making a banking turn in the sky above Massachusetts. The car flew for eight minutes at 1,400 feet during test flights last year, before completing the public flights in Wisconsin in July . These rotors will work in a similar way to helicopter rotors. Being able to take off from standstill means owners will be able to go from the road to the air straight from their driveways, car parks and even when stuck in traffic. Although you will still need at least 100 ft in diameter in order to open the wings. According to Terrafugia, the vehicle will carry four people 'in car-like comfort'. It is expected to be able to fly, nonstop, for 500 miles. This shot shows the Transition plane switching from drive mode to fly mode. The wings fold into the side of the car, built from a Sedan design. Drivers can only take off in the Transition from a runway. The Transition has a maximum flight speed of 115mph . A Terrafugia test pilot fills up the Transition flying car with petrol. The Transition can hold 23 gallons of usable fuel and uses 5 gallons per hour during flight. On the ground, it gets 35 miles per gallon . When the TF-X - a new flying car design announced by Massachusetts-based firm Terrafugia - is in drive mode, the wings fold into the side of the car and the rotors, which make it possible to take off in the TF-X from standing still, also fold away and tuck into the chassis . The TF-X model has not been tested yet, and prices haven't been announced. Terrafugia hopes to have working models of the TF-X available for sale within eight to 12 years. Like with the Transition, pilots will need 20 hours of flying and a pilot's licence to drive it, though. The flying car has always had a special place in the American imagination. Inventors have been trying to make them since the 1930s, according to Robert Mann, an airline industry analyst who owns R.W. Mann & Co. in Port Washington, New York. When the wings are folded away, the TF-X will be small enough to fit in a single-car garage. Terrafugia announced plans for the TF-X today and is hoping it will be road-ready in 12 years . When its not soaring in the air, the Transition's wings fold up, pictured, to make it a road-ready two-seat car . But Mann thinks Terrafugia has come closer than anyone to making the flying cars a reality. The . government has already granted the company's request to use special tyres and glass that are lighter than normal automotive ones, to make it . easier for the vehicle to fly. The government has also temporarily exempted the Transition from the requirement to equip vehicles with electronic stability control, which would add about six pounds to the vehicle. Mann said Terrafugia was helped by the Federal Aviation Administration's decision five years ago to create a separate set of standards for light sport aircraft. The standards govern the size and speed of the plane and licensing requirements for pilots, which are less restrictive than requirements for pilots of larger planes. Inventors and engineers have been working on the flying car concept since the 1930s. Here, a 1947 Convair Model 118 ConvAirCar is seen in flight . The 1930s Waterman Aerobile, pictured, was the first simple flying car to successfully be produced. A total of five were built and flown . Mann questions the size of the market for the Transition. The general aviation market has been in decline for two decades, he said, largely because of fuel costs and the high cost of liability for manufacturers. Also, fewer people are learning how to fly. 'This is not going to be an inexpensive aircraft to produce or market,' he said. 'It has some uniqueness, and will get some sales, but the question is, could it ever be a profitable enterprise?' Mann sees the western US as the most likely market, where people could fly instead of driving long distances.","The Â£166,000 ($279,000) Transition is part-sedan, part-private jet .

They are an incredible insight into the changing face of music lyrics - and even show that perhaps Justin Timberlake really did bring back sexy, in song lyrics at least. A US artist has created these amazing graphs detailing the popularity of certain key words in song lyrics of Billboard hits. They reveal that in fact, since Justin Timberlake's 2006 hit SexyBack, the word really has spiked in popularity in music lyrics. Mission accomplished: A US Us artists has created graphs detailing the popularity of certain key words in song lyrics of Billboard hits - and found that since Justin Timberlake pledged to bring sexy back in his 2006, its popularity has rocketed in song lyrics . The JT Effect? The horizontal axis is the year of the song and the y-axis is the song's popularity according to Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles. The more red a song is, the more often that particular word appears appears in the song. For example, if a song has 5 ""love"" words and a total of 100 words in the entire song, that song is assigned 5% and a particular shade of color. In each graph, the horizontal axis represents the year the song was released and the vertical axis is the song's popularity according to Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles. Each cell represents a song, and the more red a song is, the more often that particular word appears appears in the song. Artist and researcher Nickolay Lamm created the graphs as part of a project called  'Money, Love and Sex,' which delves into the trending lyrics of Billboard hits. It tracks the popularity of certain key words in song lyrics, tracing how their use has expanded or declined over time. 'A lot of the songs on the radio are very sexually explicit, and I know I'm not the only one to make that observation,' he told MailOnline. 'I made a guess that songs back in the day, in the 60s to 80s had lyrics that were a lot more friendly and talked about love. 'I wanted to see if these assumptions were true.' Lamm worked with a programmer on the project to create a huge database of song lyrics. 'I had to build a database of lyrics, and manual checking of their accuray. I then created a program to build these graphs, and worked with a programmer to do this - although the logic came from me.' The project was originally to analyse just three words - money, love and sex. However, after building the system, Lamm decided to expand its scope. 'I thought I'd check some more, and the project grew from there.' The couples have it: The phrases we and us have remained popular throughout history . Smile appeared to peak around the 1980s in song lyrics - despite British songstress Lily Allen's attempts to bring it back . Once he decided to expand the project, Lamm added words such as ""home,"" ""lonely,"" ""weed"" and 'ass'. The more red a song is, the more often that particular word appears appears in the song. For example, if a song has five 'love' words and a total of 100 words in the entire song, that song is assigned 5% and a particular shade of color. Despite the swinging sixties, sex was virtually unheard of in song lyrics until the 1990s . Baby was one of the few words Lamm found to have been popular in lyrics throughout history . References to body have also increased in recent years as lyrics become more sexual . Boys have remained popular throughout songwriting history .

A 16-year-old boy is in intensive care after taking a 'mortal kombat' ecstasy pill at a house party, police believe. Tests are also being carried out on a . 17-year-old boy, after both fell ill yesterday evening in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire. The 16-year-old is said to be in a serious, but stable condition. Warning: A 16-year-old has been left in a serious condition after police believe he took mortal kombat . Police Scotland believe the pair, who were admitted to Monklands District General Hospital in Airdrie at about 11.30pm, had taken illegal drugs including ecstasy and 'possibly' a mortal kombat tablet. The distinctive red tablet with a dragon image imprinted on it is an ecstasy-style drug and is thought to have been responsible for the death of 17-year-old Regane MacColl last month. Miss MacColl, from West . Dunbartonshire, died after taking one of the tablets at Glasgow . nightspot The Arches on February 1. Today, warnings issued about the red pills following Miss MacColl's death were renewed. Detective Chief Inspector Paul . Livingstone, of Coatbridge Police Office, said: 'The two youths aged 16 . and 17 remain in Monklands Hospital after taking illegal drugs, . including what is believed to be ecstasy, possibly a red 'mortal kombat' tablet, last night. 'We . are continuing to work with our partner agencies including health . officials and medical staff in connection with this investigation. 'At . this time our priority is to ensure that everyone who was at the house . party is safe and well and officers are carrying out extensive enquiries . to trace everyone involved. 'Further . to previous warnings, I would again strongly advise people to avoid . illicit drugs as their exact content is unknown and can contain . dangerous chemicals. 'Users must be aware of these dangers and understand . the devastating effect they can have.' Dr Neil Howie, NHS Lanarkshire . consultant in emergency medicine, added: 'We cannot stress highly enough . that anyone who takes an illicit drug is putting their health, and . indeed their life, in jeopardy. 'Users can never actually be sure of what . they are taking and what the contents are. 'We . would urge anyone who has taken an ecstasy tablet, and in particular . mortal kombat, who feels unwell to seek urgent medical advice and . treatment from their local hospital. 'Early . warning signs include a feeling of agitation and distress and it is . important that people are seen as early as possible if they experience . any of these symptoms.' Currently, the full ingredients of the so-called Mortal Kombat pill remain unknown, but drug experts have warned it may contain . another substance called PMA, which was blamed for the deaths of more . than 10 young people within a 60-mile radius of Manchester last year. PMA is sold in pills costing as little as Â£3 or in a crystal-like form, are sometimes pink and shaped like Love Hearts sweets, or stamped with an 'M'. Tragic: Regane MacColl died after taking mortal kombat in a Glasgow nightclub, The Arches, last month . The drug often has the same street names as ecstasy as it has a similar effect to ecstasy's main chemical, MDMA. But the active ingredient in PMA is five times stronger and takes longer to kick in, meaning many revellers take extra pills. PMA has been linked to multiple deaths, both in the UK and in Canada, Norway and Denmark. Detective Inspector Debbie Johnstone, of Coatbridge CID, appealed for anyone with information about the supply of illegal mortal kombat drugs to come forward.

Researchers have revealed a fascinating glimpse of how the world could have looked - if a shift in the Earth's tectonic plates had taken a slightly different turn. Australian researchers say the break-up of the supercontinent Gondwana about 130 Million years ago could have lead to a completely different shape of the African and South American continent. They say the move would have left a huge ocean south of today’s Sahara desert, creating a South Atlantic and a Saharan Atlantic Ocean. How South America could have ruled the world: New image shows how the Earth MIGHT have looked if Africa had been split in two. The move would have left a huge ocean south of today¿s Sahara desert, creating a South Atlantic and a Saharan Atlantic Ocean. For hundreds of millions of years, the southern continents of South America, Africa, Antarctica, Australia, and India were united in the supercontinent Gondwana. While the causes for Gondwana's fragmentation are still debated, it is clear that the supercontinent first split along along the East African coast in a western and eastern part before separation of South America from Africa took place. Today's continental margins along the South Atlantic ocean and the subsurface graben structure of the West African Rift system in the African continent, extending from Nigeria northwards to Libya, provide key insights on the processes that shaped present-day Africa and South America. Geoscientists from the University of Sydney and the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences used sophisticated plate tectonic and three-dimensional numerical modelling to recreate the shift - but with a different twist. The researchers say the shift that left Africa it its present location was almost very different. 'Extension along the South Atlantic and West African rift systems was about to split the African-South American part of Gondwana North-South into nearly equal halves, generating a South Atlantic and a Saharan Atlantic Ocean', geoscientist Sascha Brune said. 'In a dramatic plate tectonic twist, however, a competing rift along the present-day Equatorial Atlantic margins, won over the West African rift, causing it to become extinct, avoiding the break-up of the African continent and the formation of a Saharan Atlantic ocean.' How the Earth looks today: Researchers say a minor change in the twist of a tectonic plate could have led to a very different Africa . The team say their study highlights the importance of rift orientation relative to extension direction as key factor deciding whether an ocean basin opens or an aborted rift basin forms in the continental interior.

The South Atlantic part of this giant rift system evolved into an ocean basin, whereas its northern part along the West African Rift became stuck. The team say their complex numerical models gave a simple explanation: the larger the angle between rift trend and extensional direction, the more force is required to maintain a rift system. The West African rift featured a nearly orthogonal orientation with respect to westward extension which required distinctly more force than its ultimately successful Equatorial Atlantic opponent.","Break-up of the supercontinent Gondwana 130 Million years ago could have lead to a completely different world .

His head shaved and his hands bound by shackles one of Colonel Gadhafi's seven son's was today extradited to Libya, where he is wanted on corruption charges. Al-Saadi Gadhafi fled when his father's regime crumbled in 2011 and has been held under house arrest in Niger ever since. Libya had been seeking the extradition of Saadi, Gadhafi's third son, who escaped following the NATO-backed uprising. Imprisoned: The son of Colonel Gadhafi, al-Saadi, has been extradited to Libya to face corruption charges . Shaved: Images released by the Libyan Prison Authority and circulated on line show a Libyan guard shaving the head of the former dictator's son . Shared: The Facebook page of the Tripoli Revolutionaries Brigade, a militia made up of former rebels, shared the images of al-Saadi having his head shaved . 'The Libyan government received today Saadi Gadhafi and he arrived in Tripoli,' the cabinet of Prime Minister Ali Zeidan said in a statement. Al-Saadi, 41, and the former head of Libya's football federation, is being held by judiciary police forces, the government said. It thanked Niger for its cooperation and said al-Saadi would be treated according to international justice standards for prisoners. The authorities said al-Saadi - one of the deposed Libyan leader's eight children - will be treated 'in accordance with international law'. A Libyan official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said al-Saadi arrived at Tripoli's airport in the early hours of today and was transferred to a prison in the capital. The website of a government-backed militia showed what it said were pictures of al-Saadi wearing a blue prison uniform, calling him a criminal. Libyan news websites also ran pictures showing guards shaving his head in prison. Past life: Al-Saadi pictured (left) at a press conference in Sydney and (right) watching a military exercise by the elite military unit commanded by his brother, Khamis, in Zlitan, Libya before the uprising . Fled: Al-Saadi escaped Libya when his father's regime crumbled during the NATO-backed uprising in 2011 . Held: The son of Colonel Gadhafi was held under house arrest in Niger, after fleeing across the southern border to seek refuge . Captured: Al-Saadi's brother and son of Colonel Gadhafi, Seif al-Islam was captured by revolutionary fighters in Zintan, Libya. The International Criminal Court has called for the country's new leaders to hand him over to face trial at The Hague . Al-Saadi was known for his love of professional soccer and a playboy lifestyle. His brief career in Italian football ended after a failed drug test. He headed Libya's Football Federation and was also the former head of the country's special forces. Like most of Gadhafi loyalists and ex-regime officials, al-Saadi is wanted for his role in curbing protests against his father's rule and the killing of protesters. But unlike his brother, Seif al-Islam, who was groomed to be Gadhafi's successor, al-Saadi is not sought by the International Criminal Court. Seif al-Islam is held by a militia in the western Libyan town of Zintan, which refuses to hand him over to the central government for trial. Al-Saadi joins Seif al-Islam as the only of Gadhafi's children currently in Libya. At least three other Gadhafi's sons were killed during the uprising while the rest of the children sought asylum in neighboring Algeria, along with Gadhafi's wife and al-Saadi's mother, Safiya. The mother, a sister and two brothers, were granted asylum in Oman in 2012 and moved there from Algeria. Fallen: Former dictator Colonel Moammar Gadhafi was killed in October 2011 uprising . Niger had previously refused to comply with Libyan requests for al-Saadi, saying that once he was back home, he might be killed. There have been tensions between the two African nations and while Libya has criticised the presence of Gadhafi loyalists in Niger, the nation has expressed concern about 'the terrorist threat' posed by the lack of security in southern Libya, near its own border. The elder Gadhafi ruled Libya with an eccentric brutality for nearly 42 years before he was ousted by an uprising in August 2011. He was captured and killed in October, along with his son Muatassim. Gadhafi's younger sons Seif al-Arab and Khamis were killed earlier in the civil war. The rule of law is still weak in Libya after decades of Gadhafi's reign. Courts remain paralysed and security remains tenuous as unruly militias proliferate. The state, however, relies heavily on the militias to serve as security forces since the police and military remain a shambles. Successive governments have been too weak to either secure Seif al-Islam's imprisonment in the capital or put pressure on the Zintan militia to hand him over to the government. The ICC has charged Seif al-Islam with murder and persecution of civilians during the early days of the Libyan uprising. If convicted in that court, he would have faced a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, because it does not have the jurisdiction to employ the death penalty. Last summer, the international court judges ruled that Libya cannot give Seif al-Islam a fair trial and asked authorities to hand him over to The Hague. Last month Niger extradited a former high-ranking intelligence official who served under Gadhafi, and was 'plotting against the Libyan state'. Government spokesman Morou Amadou said Abdallah Mansour was extradited in February. He said the West African nation would not tolerate the 'destabilization of our neighbors from our territory'. Dozens of Gadhafi loyalists fled to Niger in 2011 as the autocratic leader lost his hold on power prior to being captured and killed. Al-Saadi Gadhafi is the former Libyan dictator's third son. He headed up the country's football federation prior to the outbreak of civil war and was well-known for his sporting career. He captained the Libyan national side and his club, Tripoli. The country's football association was run to favour the dictator's son. A Playboy's life: Al-Saadi Gadhafi is pictured at a party in Niger in 2005. A U.S. diplomatic memo in 2009 made reference to his 'excessive partying, alcohol and drugs consumption' and 'affairs with men and women' President: Al-Saadi headed up the Libyan Footballing Federation, and captained the national team . One law dictated that only al-Saadi's name was to be announced, while other players were to have their numbers alone announced. Referees favoured al-Saadi's side and the country's security forces were employed to silence protests in the crowds. He signed for Italian Serie A team Perugia in 2003, and employed Argentinian football legend Diego Maradona as his technical consultant. He made one appearance for the side before failing a drugs test. Gadhafi joined UEFA Champions League Italian qualifiers Udinese Calcio during the 2005-06 season, playing just 10 minutes of one match. The following season he transferred to rival Italian side U.C. Sampdoria, but did not play for the club. The 41-year-old is married to the daughter of a former Libyan military commander. In 2009, a U.S. diplomatic bulletin made reference to al-Saadi's playboy lifestyle. It labelled him the 'black sheep' of the family, and mentioned scuffles with police forces in Europe, 'abuse of drugs and alcohol, excessive partying' and affairs with men and women. It has been suggested that his bisexuality prompted al-Saadi's arranged marriage to the commander's daughter. Gay pornography was reportedly found among his possessions when his home was ransacked when Tripoli fell in 2011.

Francesca . had spent more than £4,700 on flights to New York, where she spent . £1,850 at high-end fashion store Miu Miu and more than £2,000 on hotels. She . paid £613 at the Soho House Hotel in New York on June 3, and two days . later had shelled out £1,424 at the Gansevoort Hotel. In addition, she . also withdrew large amounts of cash while she stayed in the city. She also used the card to pay a £1,280 bill at the Ritz hotel in Paris on the same day that she bought a Chloe dress for £723. On June 12 last year she spent £5,385 at Miu Miu London, and £2,650 at designer store Prada. The relationship between the Grillo sisters and the couple collapsed altogether last year after Saatchi's finance director Rahul Gajjar, pictured arriving at court, discovered how much the Grillos had been spending on their credit cards . Elisabetta visited more high . street shops and fewer high fashion boutiques than Francesca – with Zara . and John Lewis among them – but still managed to rack up almost £5,000 . personal expenditure in the month, including cash withdrawals on the company . card. Among other luxury . brands the women blew thousands at Dolce and Gabbana, Chanel, Louis . Vuitton, Vivienne Westwood and the Four Seasons hotel group. Over the course of a four-year period she splurged £58,744 in just 50 transactions at an array of designer shops and spas. But . other personal assistants not charged with any offence also spent money . – at Annabel’s nightclub, the Babington House country venue and on . Christian Louboutin shoes. Anthony . Metzer, QC, defending Lisa, said of the Grillos: ‘They believed they . were authorised to incur this personal expenditure.’ Mr . Metzer told the court that the Italian sisters worked long hours for . ‘modest’ salaries – £25,000 for Lisa and £28,000 for her sister – and . suggested it was common practice for assistants to be allowed to spend . on themselves. They would also be able to live rent-free at a flat owned by Miss Lawson in Battersea, central London, the court heard. The . jury was told Francesca's average monthly spend was £48,000 while . Elisabetta's was £28,000 - compared with the other personal assistants . who racked up bills of £8,000. Mr Saatchi's finance director Mr Gajjar confronted the sisters about their spending in the kitchen of the Saatchi family home in west London on July 3 last year. The pair admitted lavishing money on themselves but initially offered to make amends and pay it back before the police were called in.","Sisters lived luxury lifestyle 'portrayed in glossy magazines', jury was told .

Sandy the German Shepherd, dubbed 'wonky', was discovered unable to walk after being dumped by his owners on the Greek island of Corfu two months ago. He had been left abandoned in a malnourished state - causing him to develop severely deformed legs. Scroll down for video . Walkies: Sandy was discovered unable to walk after being abandoned by his owners on the Greek island of Corfu two months ago.  He has now taken his first steps after Pat Clark (right) drove him to England for surgery . Recovering: Following his arrival in Britain, vets offered to operate on Sandy (pictured with Ms Clark) for free . But he was given a chance of a new life after Pat Clark raised funds to drive him more than 2,000 miles to Cambridge in England, where vets offered to operate on him free of charge. Now, following two successful operations, Sandy can stand up, walk and run for the first time. Ms Clark, 55, who will adopt the dog once he has fully recovered, said he was still undergoing physiotherapy and hydrotherapy at Companion Care Vets at the Beehive Centre. 'We are one million percent happy with how the surgery has gone,' she said. 'The vets have done an amazing job. 'Wonky': Sandy had been dumped by owners in a malnourished state - causing him to develop deformed legs . Saved: The dog, pictured before his operations, is still undergoing courses in physiotherapy and hydrotherapy . Deformed: The extent of Sandy's deformity - believed to have been caused by malnutrition - is shown on X-Ray . 'When we first brought him over from Greece, he stayed with us over Christmas and as a result he learnt his way around. He became a part of the family and parting with him now would be completely out of the question.' Vet Chaim Pilosof, who carried out Â£2,000 worth of operations on Sandy's legs for free, said he was optimistic that the dog's recovery would be successful. 'The second operation was more . complicated due to fact that both front legs were deformed but slightly . in different way, which made the repair of the left leg trickier, and a . tendon was compromised as a result,' he said. Happy: Ms Clark (right), 55, said she was 'one million percent happy' with how the surgery had gone. Meanwhile, vet Chaim Pilosof (left) said he was optimistic that the dog's recovery would be successful . Unknown: Vets at Companion Care Vets are still none-the-wiser as to how Sandy's bowed legs came about . Loved: Ms Clark said Sandy quickly became a part of her family - and that she could not part with him now . 'The rehabilitation is taking longer due to complication with infection (which is now good under control) and the damage to the tendon.' Despite having successfully completed both operations, vets are still none-the-wiser as to how the bowed legs came about. 'We believe Sandy's condition developed . due to nutritional deficiencies, but we do not have a proof one way or . another,' said Mr Pilosof. Complications: Mr Pilosof said the dog's rehabilitation was taking a while 'due to complication with infection' Difference: Sandy's right front leg, which is now straight following the two operations . Stark contrast: The dog's front legs appear almost perfectly straight on X-Ray . 'It is impossible to say why his legs came short when he was a puppy.' Since Sandy arrived in the country, numerous donations have been made to Ms Clarks's Essex-based charity, Mutts in Distress. These have enabled the charity to fund metal plates to straighten Sandy's legs, which normally cost Â£200, as well as a dog bed. Heading home: Since Sandy arrived in the country, numerous donations have been made to Ms Clarks's Essex-based charity, Mutts in Distress. Above, the dog is pictured recovering with vets . 'Sandy hasn't had any more material donations since the bed and plates were given to us,' said Ms Clark. 'However, we have had cash donations from all around the world, as far afield as China, Canada and America.

Local woman Peng Tu, 38, said: ‘It was hardly a surprise that the river was flammable, the smell has been unbearable for years but no one has taken any notice.

A reformed thug donated his kidney to a mother-of-three in an attempt to atone for his violent past. Peter Farrell, 42, admitted he was still haunted by the fact that as a young man he would beat up men who owed him money, and on one occasion was seen doing so by his victim's young son. The incident shocked him into renouncing violence, but wanted to make up for his actions by donating one of his kidneys to Saira Khan, 41 - becoming one of Britain's first Good Samaritan donors. Donor: Peter Farrell, from east London has become one of Britain's first Good Samaritan donors after choosing to give his kidney to Saira Khan . Mr Farrell underwent the operation last month, saying he wanted to fulfill a promise made to his grandmother, who died 10 years ago, that he would do something good in his life after his violent actions as a younger man. 'I was very cruel. I used to hurt people. I used to beat up people for money,' he told The Sunday Times. Father-of-four Mr Farrell, from east London, said that his grandmother had stood by him despite his violent escapades, and that he wanted to honour her request that he did something positive in his life. Mr Farrell said donating his kidney had brought him closer to his family, and had made them 'proud' of him. Mrs Khan, who suffered from kidney failure, had been searching for a donor since 2011, even advertising online in her attempt to find one. Members of her family, including her solicitor husband Omar, were tested to see if they were a match, but none were. Mr Farrell, who has worked as a barman and builder, did not know Mrs Khan, from south London, although he had met her Mr Khan previously. Surgery: Mrs Khan, who has three children aged nine, four and three, is now recovering from her surgery on February 12, at St George's Hospital, Tooting . Mr Khan had mentioned his wife's illness, prompting Mr Farrell to take action to help her, and he is one of the first donors in the country to choose which stranger is given an organ. He said: 'Without a doubt, giving my kidney is the best thing I have ever done in my life. I am so happy for her and her kids.' Mrs Khan, who has three children aged nine, four and three, is now recovering from her surgery on February 12, at St George's Hospital, Tooting. She believes that if would-be donors knew who their organ would be going to they would be more willing to donate. She said. 'He [Farrell] has saved my life. No one in my family could do it and he is a complete stranger.' The NHS has previously directed altruistic donors to give their organs anonymously and the donor and recipient were banned from knowing each others' identity until after the operation, and with both giving consent for their names to be revealed. There have only be 16 'directed altruistic' donations approved by the Human Tissue Authority, although it is not known how many have led directly to operations. All organ donations from living people in the UK must be approved by the HTA, based on criteria set by Parliament. The HTA ensures donors are aware of the risks associated with transplants, that they have not been offered any reward to donate and have not been put under pressure to do so. Potential donors and recipients are interviewed by an Independent Assessor who then submits a report to the HTA. During 2012/13 the HTA approved 104 non-directed cases, a rise from 38 in the previous year. Altogether, the HTA approved 1243 living organ donation cases in 2012/13, up from 1217 in 2011/12, inclduing 1047 â€˜directedâ€™ kidney donations. 'Giving someone an organ is a brave and amazing gift: to do it for someone whom you don't know is doubly so, and the huge increase in people will do so is incredible,' said an HTA spokesman. 'The HTA works on more living donation cases every year, and we expect this to continue.'","Peter Farrell, 42, chose to donate his kidney to Saira Khan, 41 .

A mother has shed more than half her body weight for the festive season after being disgusted by a photo taken at a Christmas party last year. Carol Bryant, 42, from Brighton, was 'horrified' by her 21 stone frame when she saw a photo of herself socialising with a friend. The full-time mother vowed to shed the weight in time for the following festive season - and this year she will be rewarded for her efforts as she can host her own Christmas party as a svelte size 12. 'I looked like a Christmas pudding': Carol Bryant, right, said she was was horrified when she saw this picture of herself at a Christmas party last year . Slim: Carol has now dropped from 21 stone to 9 stone 10lbs and a trim size 12 after going on an extreme diet . She said: 'I was mortified when the photo went up on Facebook. l didn't even recognise myself at first, I looked like a Christmas pudding.' Determined to change her ways, in January 2013 she decided to try a meal replacement programme which limits your daily calorie intake to just 500 calories each day. 'I knew I had to do something about my weight,' she explained. Ian Marber, nutritionist says: 'The diets are monitored and so are considered safe for that reason. 'But very low calorie diets are not to be undertaken in the long term without supervision and also, importantly, clearance from your GP. 'It's what you eat after the diet has finished that's vital and I recommend seeing a nutrition professional afterwards to learn how to eat, not how to diet.' 'I was absolutely massive and I was terrified I would have a heart attack. 'Not to mention how awful I looked in photographs next to my slim friends. 'I was so jealous of all the fashionable clothes they got to wear, while I was stuck in frumpy t-shirts and baggy trousers.'

And I feel incredible.' Devastated by seeing herself in the photos Carol vowed to boycott Christmas parties until she lost the weight . Unsurprisingly, Carol's 5000 calorie-a-day diet saw her weight balloon from 15 stone and a size 16, to a massive 21 stone and a size 28 .

Carol had always struggled with her weight. When she was in her teens she was a size 16, then in 2007 after having her daughter Lois, now six, she piled on more pounds. This year she will be rewarded for her efforts and hosting her own Christmas party as a svelte size 12 . She quit her job working in an office to become a full-time mother, but would spend her days sat on the sofa gorging on greasy take-aways, fatty chocolates and salty crisps. Unsurprisingly, her 5000 calorie-a-day diet saw her weight balloon from 15 stone and a size 16, to a massive 21 stone and a size 28. Carol says: 'It was disgusting how large I got, and I was no role model for my little girl. I was constantly hungry and would shovel platefuls of food down my throat without even thinking. It was an addiction.' But within the first two weeks of her diet, Carol had lost an incredible 24Ibs. 'The weight was just falling off of me,' she said. 'It was an amazing feeling and it spurned me on to lose more weight.' Carol also began walking every day so she now she weighs in at just 9st 10Ibs, dress size 12. Instead of having the meal replacements, she's now joined Slimming World so she can sustain her weightloss and said she's never felt more confident. 'This year I can't wait to show off my party dress,' she said. 'I won't be hiding away in the corner, I want to be the centre of attention. I want to party my way through the celebrations, making up for all those lost years.' Breakfast: Four slices of white toast, buttered . Lunch: White bread cheese sandwich with crisps, soda .

An historic house which was once the home of two of Henry VIII's wives has been put up for sale for £1.9million. Walton Manor, in Walton-on-the-Hill, Surrey, is a 800-year-old country home and was once part of top boarding school Eton College. As well as a fabulously elaborate home including tennis court, the remains of a chapel, plus other restored Jacobean features, the property is full of history - and was once home to Henry VIII's first and fourth wives. Steeped in history: The £1.9m Walton Manor, the living room pictured, was once home to two of Henry VIII's wives as well as other notable historical figures . Features: The five-bedroom home, which still has many of its original features such as this flint wall, belonged to Catherine of Aragon - the King's first wife - in 1509 . Expansive: The property is split into two sections - one a series of apartments and the other, the older south-west wing, pictured, which is now up for sale . On entering the south-west wing of Walton Manor, the would-be buyer is greeted with a grand reception . hall, leading on to a cloakroom, drawing room and dining room. There is also a study, a sun-room and five enormous . bedrooms - four of which are en suite. The £1,875,000 property retains a number of its ancient features including flint walls and the original arched entrance. On the first floor, the windows are all made of stone while one of the rooms includes a restored Jacobean fireplace. Some elements of a chapel - including a large stone window -  can also be found on the first floor. Above . the doorway leading to the upper part of the chapel is a beam which has . been identified as 'Memel' oak grown in the Bosphorus, which was often . brought back by ships as ballast. What an entrance! The property, which was used by Canadian forces in the Second World War, has a very grand hallway complete with sweeping staircase . Modern mix: The property, which was given to fourth wife Anne of Cleaves in 1543, has a stylish and modern kitchen and eating area, pictured . It also has 2.8 acres of land which includes secluded gardens, a tennis court and double garage. Walton . Manor is thought to have been built around 1260 by John de Lovelot who, . from 1275 to 1289, was a Puisine Judge of the Common Pleas. The south west wing is the oldest part of the . Manor and originally consisted of a two-storey hall and a chapel. It is understood that floors and partitions were added in the 17th Century, with many later additions to the back of the property in 1891. At the conquest Walton Manor was . granted to Richard de Tonbridge, whose descendants held it until 1314. It then passed into the hands of Baron Hugh Despencer until he was . hanged by Queen Isabella in 1327. Slick: Despite being over 800 years old, the property - which was renovated 30 years ago - has all the mod cons in its fabulously stylish kitchen . Eating well! The wooden-finished dining room, which would easily seat a dozen guests, is just off the entrance hall . 1- Catherine of Aragon (annulled; died while detained under guard at Kimbolton Castle) 2- Anne Boleyn (annulled and later executed) 3- Jane Seymour (died days after giving birth, widely believed to be following birth complications) 4- Anne of Cleves (annulled) 5- Catherine Howard (annulled and later executed) 6- Catherine Parr (widowed) In 1332, the Manor was held by John de Warrenne who, rather quaintly, was granted the . right to hold two fairs at Walton Manor. And prior to being lived in by Henry VIII's wives, the home was also occupied by Elizabeth Woodville, the wife of Edward IV. Later on, Admiral Sir Benjamin Hallowell, who served with Lord Nelson at the Battle of the Nile, lived in the property. In 1509 King Henry VIII gave the manor to Catherine of Aragon, his first wife. The couple divorced and in 1533 the manor was granted to Sir Nicholas Carew - an English courtier and diplomat. The Carew family remained in possession of Walton Manor and much of the land until approximately 1860. However, in 1543 Anne of Cleaves, the King's fourth wife, moved in. It is unknown how long she stayed in the property. During The Second World War the Manor was requisitioned by the government and used by the Canadian armed forces. The . property was extended after the war and, around 30 years ago, it was . split into two. One wing of the expansive property was then converted into posh apartments. It is the south-west wing of the home which has now been put up for sale through Savills with a £1.875 million guide price. David Semple, director of Savills' Reigate office described Walton Manor as 'a real gem'. He said: 'You won't find too many homes which can be traced back 800 years.. 'Over the years the home has grown but it has large parts dating back to the 13th century and this is very special. 'It . is a real slice of history. Short of being an official Royal residence, . it is unlikely you'll find many properties which were lived in my three . Queens including two wives of Henry VIII. If the walls could talk.

A passenger plane flying from Lebanon to Iraq was forced to turn back after the Iraqi transport minister's son missed the flight and phoned Baghdad to stop the aircraft from landing, a spokesman for the airline said. Marwan Salha, acting chairman of Middle East Airlines said the flight, scheduled to leave at 12.40pm, had been delayed for six minutes while MEA staff looked for Mahdi al-Amiri, son of Hadi al-Amiri, and his friend in the business lounge. 'We made the necessary announcements and the last calls,' he said. 'The plane took off but one of the passengers turned out to be the son of the minister of Iraq.' A Middle East Airlines jet flying from Lebanon to Iraq was forced to return to Beirut after the Iraqi transport minister's son, who had missed the flight, called to Baghdad to stop it landing, it has been claimed . Salha said that when Amiri arrived at the gate he was angry and said: 'I will not allow the plane to land in Baghdad.' Twenty-one minutes into the flight, the Baghdad airport station manager called MEA operations to tell them there was no clearance to land, Salha said. The plane then returned to Beirut and the passengers disembarked. 'It's very disturbing because this is pure nepotism,' Salha said, adding that he hoped to resume flights to Iraq on Friday but that there would not be another flight on Thursday. Denial: A spokesman for Iraqi Transport Minister Hadi al-Amiri said the flight had been turned around due to 'airport cleaning' Transport Minister Hadi al-Amiri is head of the Badr Organisation, once an armed Shi'ite militia, and a political ally of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. Many Iraqis believe that relatives of elected officials and leaders of political parties act as if they are above the law. Iraq's Transport Ministry confirmed the airliner had been turned around but said this was due to airport cleaning and that the minister's son had not been due to be a passenger on it. Kareem al-Nuri, the transport minister's media adviser, said: 'There were cleaning operations in the airport and specific measures were taken. 'We asked all flights not to land in Baghdad airport after 9 a.m. but this flight arrived after this time, so we asked it to turn back. 'This information (about the minister's son) is not true and the minister is not accepting such behavior. The minister's son was not scheduled to take that flight at all.' An official at Baghdad airport, who asked not to be named, said air traffic was normal, with 30 flights landing on Thursday. The only one turned around was the one from Beirut. Iraqis mocked Amiri and his son on social media as news of the incident spread. A girl named Diana wrote: 'Sounds like Uday and his father rose from the grave', a reference to the late Saddam Hussein and his son Uday, known for arbitrary behavior.","Flight delayed while staff looked for Mahdi al-Amiri son of Hadi al-Amiri .

Even when one of her alter egos was arrested, it wasn't until police gave her a male strip search that they realised 'he' was in fact a girl. 'Nobody understands what it’s like to be told that the person you love and want to spend the rest of your life with is not real,' said one in a victim's impact statement read at Guildford Crown Court before sentencing. 'I just want to stop hurting. What did I ever do wrong to you? I felt repulsive and dirty, it made me angry, I wanted to kill myself, because I couldn’t cope.' Aaron and Connor were born in 2009 when Barker created fake Facebook profiles with which to lure her teenage friends on dates. With the rendezvous secured, she showed up wearing baggy clothes and hats to hide her true identity, Guildford Crown Court heard. Barker, dressed as Aaron, even accompanied one of the girls to her family home and met her parents, who knew Barker as a girl. Her alter-egos became so complex that she even concocted elaborate back stories for them, telling one of her victims that Aaron . had lost his mother to a car accident and two brothers, one to leukaemia . and the other in a drowning accident. The court heard how Barker had 'groomed' the girls by pretending to be painfully shy, even restricting communication to text messages when with one of them. That played upon the victim’s own shyness and was compounded by the alleged boy, Luke Jones, claiming to have bone cancer, the court heard. Deceit: Miss Barker with Hollyoaks star Kieron Richardson. The court heard how she suffers from autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, commonly known as ADHD . Even when one of her alter-egos . dumped one of the girls, she created another one, who consoled her and . exploited her vulnerability. Judge Peter Moss said Barker had . played with their minds and physically with their bodies, describing . what she did as 'sucking on their emotions'. Her cover was only blown when one of . the girls removed Aaron's hat while asleep and realised he and Connor, . whom her friend was dating, were the same person. Even then she didn't . recognise he was also her friend Gemma. After Aaron's alleged infidelity, the girls discussed the situation and contacted police. Officers went to her friend’s home when 'Aaron' was expected and questioned 'him', but he became aggressive and said he had been in a car crash and was in hospital in Kingston-upon-Thames at the time he was accused of being exposed in the girl’s bedroom. When it emerged there was no evidence of that, 'he' telephoned detectives to say Gemma Barker could provide him with an alibi. The same officer also received an email from 'Luke Jones' confessing to sexually assaulting the younger girl. When the net was closing in, Barker . deliberately fractured her jaw and tried to blame another alter-ego, . 'Luke Jones', for attacking her and forcing her to pose as 'Aaron', the court heard. Jailed: Barker pictured outside her home in Staines, West London. She received 30-month terms for the sexual assaults and three months for the fraud, the sentences to be concurrent . 'On June 9, 2010, the officers arrested who they thought was Aaron Lampard,' said prosecutor Ruby Selva. 'He was patted down and searched by . officers and taken into custody as a male but it was only as clothes . were taken in the custody suite that it became apparent that it was a . female - and this defendant.' Barker, . now 20, of Staines, Middlesex, was told by Judge Moss that she would be . in custody for the first half of the term and serve the remainder on . licence. The judge said Barker had admitted . that the relationships included kissing, cuddling and sexual touching, . adding: 'Nothing that you have ever said to any expert or the police . sheds any light on, or provides any understanding of, your motivation . for these offences. 'Nor have I nor anyone else seen any flicker of remorse for what you have done.' Barker . showed no emotion as she left the dock to start her sentence, to be . served at least initially in a young offenders' institution. She had previously admitted two counts . of sexual assault and one of fraud. The offences took place between . November 23 2009 and May 10 2010. She received 30-month terms for the sexual assaults and three months for the fraud, the sentences to be concurrent. The . judge said Barker's guilty pleas were 'a complete reversal of the . position you had held up until then', having previously used 'persistent . lies and denials'. Before sentencing: Gemma Barker, pictured with her mother as they left home in Staines for the sentencing hearing . Referring . to her first victim, the judge said: 'You, as Aaron, played upon her . and her parents' vulnerability, by pouring out to them a saga of lies, . including that Aaron’s mother had been killed in a road traffic accident . in America, that his brother had died of leukaemia and that another . brother had drowned.' He said it was important to stress . that Barker’s deliberate deceitfulness and her disguise were so . convincing they fooled not only the victims but their families and . friends and also experienced police officers. 'Your cunning and deceptiveness were entirely responsible for the victims being so utterly and cruelly tricked. 'They have nothing for which to reproach themselves.' She had committed repeated sexual assaults - up to 20 on one girl, by pretending to be a boy, and perhaps half that number on the other girl, using two more male disguises. The fraud count related to her having tried to get compensation for having been assaulted and seriously injured by one of her fictitious characters, Luke Jones. During the hearing, Barker's . barrister, Chetna Patel, referred to probation and psychological reports . which found she suffers from autism spectrum disorder and attention . deficit hyperactivity disorder, commonly known as ADHD. 'Miss . Barker struggles to understand the motives and the intentions of . others,' she said, telling the court that her client wanted to become . 'the perfect boy' for each of the victims. The judge told Barker: 'Your . deceptions were entirely responsible for the victims being so utterly . and cruelly tricked, they have nothing with which to reproach . themselves.' Even experienced police officers who became involved in the case were deceived by her disguise at first, he said. He added: 'The psychological damage to these innocent young women is self-evident.' 'You have adversely touched their lives,' the judge told Barker.","Gemma Barker used fake profiles on Facebook to lure girls, 15 and 16 .

Britain risks ‘importing a wave of crime’ from Bulgaria and Romania when work immigration curbs are lifted on January 1, the government was warned today. Tory MPs said crime rates linked to eastern Europeans were ‘really quite startling’ and will only get worse in the New Year. Ministers also came under pressure for failing to draw up any estimates on how many more people might move to the UK to help schools, hospitals and the police to plan ahead. From January 1 restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK will be lifted . Britain is required to lift temporary restrictions on the free movement of people from Romania and Bulgaria at the start of 2014. The government is rushing through new laws to stop migrants claiming benefits in the UK for the first three months. But in a debate in Parliament today, Tory and Labour MPs lined up to criticise the government’s approach and for not knowing what the impact will be when the borders are opened. Conservative MP Philip Hollobone: ‘We are importing a wave of crime from Romania and Bulgaria.’ He warned that crime among Romanians in England was ‘really quite startling’, adding: ‘Romanians are seven times more likely to be arrested in London than a British national. ‘Romanians account for more than 11 per cent of all foreign offenders, despite making up, at the moment, just a tiny proportion of residents. Labour MP Keith Vaz criticised the government for failing to produce an estimate of how many more people would move to Britain . ‘Last year, Romanians accounted for almost half of all arrests for begging, and one third of all arrests for pickpocketing in the capital.’ Mr Hollobone said that as a special constable with the British Transport Police on the London Underground he has first-hand experience of the problem of Romania criminals . ‘And I must tell you, that eight out of 10 pickpockets are from Romania. ‘So the whole thing is completely out of control and the Romanian authorities need to provide the British police with information about the criminals which they know are in this country, far more quickly than they are currently providing.’ He added that voters would find it ‘disgusting’ the Government had failed to fulfil its ‘basic duty’ to find out how many Bulgarians and Romanians planned to come to the UK on January 1. Labour MP Keith Vaz - the Labour chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee - said ministers did not know the number because they never asked their experts and advisers to find out. Mr Vaz added: ‘I think that is a big mistake because now we have estimates that vary from 10,000 from the Bulgarian ambassador, to 20,000 from the Romanian ambassador, to 50,000 from Migration Watch.’ It comes after Sir David Metcalf, chairman of the Migration Advisory Committee, told MPs last week that he had never been asked by ministers to estimate the number of Bulgarians and Romanians expected to come to the UK when labour market restrictions are lifted. Many Tory MPs are worried that lifting EU restrictions will see tens of thousands of workers from both countries coming to work in the UK. They have repeatedly demanded the Government put an estimate on the number after the lifting of restrictions in 2005 led to many more Polish migrants arriving at British ports than initial estimates by civil servants.","Government planning criticised by MPs during Debate in Parliament .

'We would never copy the British': French PM Jean-Marc Ayrault has criticised the UK's economic policy which he says has caused 'mass poverty' The Prime Minister of France has launched a blistering attack on British economic policy – saying it is responsible for 'mass poverty'. Jean-Marc Ayrault painted a picture of a United Kingdom racked by extremes of wealth and poverty and said his own country would ‘never copy’ it - yet did not acknowledge that his country's own economy was in crisis. Asked about austerity cuts imposed by British Prime Minister David Cameron's coalition government, Mr Ayrault said: 'France is about to regain the level of national wealth it had before the 2008 crisis, and Britain has still not got there. 'So the situation in Britain, with the mass poverty that it generated is far worse than in France.’ His remarks came as credit agency Standard & Poor's cut its long-term rating of the European Union by one notch to AA+ today, saying it had concerns about how the bloc's budget was financed. The 63-year-old Socialist told TV channel TF1 last night: ‘I see a lot more poverty, more inequalities, and if I was to look for a model to reform France I would want to save the French model.’ He said that he would ‘reform’ France but ‘certainly not copy what others do, especially not if we're not talking about the best.’ Mr Ayrault was particularly critical of Britain's zero-hour contracts under which employees agree to be available for work as and when required. ‘Do you find this okay?’ he asked. ‘Do you think the French would accept this? This is not our policy.’ Mr Ayrault’s left-wing party is associated with turning France in one of the cushiest places for workers anywhere in the world. It brought in the 35-hour week and – since Mr Ayrault was appointed Prime Minister last year by President Francois Hollande – there have been a raft of other massively expensive measures. These have included a reduction in the retirement age from 62 to 60 for some categories of workers, a rise in the minimum wage and the introduction of a 36-month rent freeze on new contracts. But, despite all this, the French economy is in crisis, and polls regularly show that Mr Hollande is the most unpopular president in the history of the country. Mr Ayrault criticised the austerity cuts imposed by David Cameron (left), but ignored the fact that the French economy is in crisis and that polls regularly show that President Francois Hollande (right) is unpopular . There has been particular criticism of proposed top tax rate of 75 per cent, and Mr Hollande’s admission that he ‘dislikes the rich’. Mr Ayrault has just announced a controversial budget approving more tax rises and cuts in public spending in a bid to rein in the high public deficit. British Chancellor George Osborne produced an autumn statement forecasting economic growth of 2.4 per cent in 2014, with many commentators suggesting that recovery is well underway. Meanwhile, the downgrade of the European economy by S&P was dismissed by EU leaders and other officials as misguided. In a statement that . came 11 months after it announced it had a 'negative' outlook on the . region, S&P said: 'In our opinion, the overall creditworthiness of the now 28 European . Union member states has declined. 'EU budgetary negotiations have become more contentious, . signalling what we consider to be rising risks to the support of the EU . from some member states.' European officials said they were not . surprised by the move since S&P recently downgraded the Netherlands . and has lowered its view on six other member states - France, Italy, . Spain, Malta, Slovenia and Cyprus - in the past year. But they . pointed out that the EU has no debt or deficit to speak of and its . budget is a stand-alone entity financed by 28 countries, making it one . of the most stable institutions and most reliable borrowers in the . world. Francois Hollande is the least popular French President in history, according to polls. ‘Another couple of weeks, and we’ll be able to call [our supporters] by their first names!’ a presidential adviser said bitterly the other day, summing up the mood at the presidential Elysée Palace. The President had just been booed on Remembrance Day. The Prime Minister was ridiculed in parliament by members of his own Socialist party. Protesters in Brittany — who have taken to wearing red caps like their ancestors resisting the King’s taxes — tore apart new toll gates on highways. Farmers circled Paris with tractors, slowing down access for almost a day. Truck drivers, poultry breeders, teachers, midwives, craftsmen, even riding instructors and their ponies have taken to the streets to yell at tax rises. Across the eurozone, there are signs that economic conditions are improving — and yet in France there are daily demonstrations and business failures. Representing only 8 per cent of the workforce, trade unions are unable to channel this anger. Violent protests burst out and public outrage is stoked by the bonuses granted to CEOs. ‘Ras le bol!’ (Enough is enough!) France is fuming with rage—and the party that is profiting from the situation is the far-Right Front National. A year and a half into his mandate, Hollande has run out of steam. Despite the bravura of his foreign policy—Mali, Iran, if not Syria — the French now doubt his leadership abilities and competence of his government. The rumour is that cabinet members are already looking for other jobs. Politicians and pundits compare scenarios: will the President change his Prime Minister? Will he call elections and risk losing his majority to the conservatives? Should he resign, as some suggest, even though, short of his committing murder, French institutions protect the President for the duration of his five-year mandate? ‘None of that will happen,’ sighs the Elysée adviser. ‘Don’t underestimate his capacity to stay put in the merde . . .’ An optimist and champion of economic cycle theory, François Hollande staunchly believes the situation can only improve, repeating against all odds that there is no recession, that unemployment will decrease by the end of the year, that public debt will diminish and welfare will be protected. History and his Socialist predecessor as president, François Mitterrand, have convinced him that the French cannot endure harsh facts, and that the art of politics starts with mincing words. His appeasement strategy has backfired. The Socialist President was elected on the promise that the rich would pay. Now almost everybody does — since 2009, taxation has risen from 42 per cent to 46 per cent of GDP. The Prime Minister announced an overhaul of spending, a political coup to save his skin, but people worry that taxes will rise even more. Hollande has been credited for taking small steps in the right direction — so small that competitiveness measures have not boosted business, job flexibility regulations have not paid off and neither have pension reforms. The public service system is about to become the largest proportionally in the world, at 57 per cent of GDP. The core of Hollande’s electorate are public servants, who resent not being rewarded more. Their support is dwindling. Beyond dire economic circumstances, the legalisation of gay marriage, pushed through parliament before the summer, has stirred up French society. Shaken by globalisation, wary of immigration and deceived by electoral promises, people have reacted strongly. The opposition UMP party, weakened by internal fighting, has not benefited from government disarray. Seventy-four per cent believe the conservatives would do no better. A new form of populism is emerging, more individualistic, a blend of anger at the elites, Right and Left, and at the sense of national drift. The Front National is revelling in all this. It is ahead in the polls for the forthcoming local and European elections. Her political platform may be inconsistent, her economic programme inept, her anti-immigration stance deceitful, but party leader Marine Le Pen speaks the language of the common man. The vocabulary of the extreme Right is melting into common parlance, its racial undertones amplified by social media. Christiane Taubira, the Justice Minister, born in French Guiana, and the eloquent champion of the gay marriage bill, has become the target of foul racial slurs. The political vacuum allows for less inhibited public speech and tactics. The French have gone through similar periods before, rage simmering without leading to radical change. The elites should brace themselves for the elections in the spring.

A female Saudi Arabian judoka will be allowed to compete in the Olympics while wearing her hijab, it has emerged. Wodjan Shaherkani's participation in . the London 2012 Games had been in doubt after the International Judo . Federation said she needed to remove the head scarf for her match. But Saudi Olympic Committee (SOC) spokesman Razan Baker announced yesterday that the IJF had relented its . stance after negotiations between officials, clearing the way for . Shaherkani to fight on Friday. Scroll down for video . Cleared to fight: Saudi Arabia's Wojdan Shaherkani will be allowed to compete in the women's Olympic judo after an agreement was reached for her to wear a specially designed hijab . She and teammate Sarah Attar, the . kingdom's first ever female Olympic competitors, have both signed . agreements agreeing to compete only in kit that 'sticks to Islamic . principles,' Ms Baker told CNN. The decision comes as the inclusion of . female athletes for the first time ever in the Saudi Olympic team has . prompted a heated reaction among hardliners in the oil-rich Middle . Eastern state. Some conservative Islamists have . denounced Attar and Shaherkani as shameless 'whores', but many other . Saudis have praised them as trailblazers for the progress of women's . rights. The decision to allow Shaherkani, 16, . to compete dressed in Islamic-compliant clothing threatens now to . intensify that quarrel. She had said she would refuse to compete in the . +78-kilogram judo category if she was banned from wearing a hijab. Saudi newspapers reported that she had . telephoned her father to say she would withdraw from the Olympics if . she was forced to compete uncovered. The president of the IJF Marius Vizer, . said last week that Shaherkani would have to fight without a hijab to . comply with 'the principle and spirit of judo'. The IJF's regulations for the Olympic . Games state that no headgear can be worn, and the federation had said there . could be a danger to fighters if a hijab is inadvertently used for an . otherwise legal strangulation grip. But Ms Razan said yesterday that, . after negotiation between the SOC, the International Olympic Committee . and the IFJ, an agreement had now been reached on an acceptable form of . headscarf. 'They agreed on a design and she will . compete wearing this design,' Ms Baker said, adding that she did not . know how this design looked. Game on: Wodjan Ali Seraj Abdulrahim Shahrkhani will compete in the +78kg judo competition while runner Sarah Attar will be at the start line for the 800m at the Olympic Stadium . Victory Park in the Olympic Village: Competing in the Olympics is such a huge step for women in Saudi Arabia, they are happy to abide by the strict caveats laid out by their country's leaders . Conservative Muslim clerics in Saudi Arabia oppose women's sport, arguing that it is immodest and against their nature. That view was reflected in Twitter postings, including one under a hashtag that would translate as 'Olympic_Whores'. 'One should not hesitate to describe . their participation as shameful and a great sin,' Khaled Al Jabri, whose . Twitter profile listed him as a Saudi from Jeddah, wrote in one of . thousands of postings on the subject. 'Whores of the Olympics ... They want . to run so that they intentionally fall down and reveal [their figures],' said a tweeter using the name mloven2100, another Saudi. In Saudi Arabia when in public women are required to wear a black abaya and head scarf by law. They are banned from driving their own cars and they are not permitted to run their own businesses. Women are also not allowed inside main government buildings. Travel is very difficult for women in Saudra Arabia. Regardless of their age, they are not allowed to travel abroad without official permission from their guardians, which has to be authorised by the government. Two years ago lingerie shops were staffed by men which could prove awkward when women had to discuss underwear sizing with the men. But it's a year of change and women are now allowed to work in malls as sales clerks in lingerie shops thanks to several campaigns both by officials such as the past labour minister Ghazi Algosaibi and activists such as Reem Asaad. But supporters of the athletes hijacked the hashtag to post messages in their defence. 'I'm proud of Saudi women's . participation in the Olympics,' wrote Fahad Al Enzi, a member of a . prominent Saudi tribe whose profile listed him as from Riyadh. A woman who identified herself as . Safaa, a Saudi, tweeted: 'Women walking behind the Saudi delegation is . historic. Next we'll be carrying the flag and walking side by side, . equal.' Competing . in the Olympics is such a huge step for women in Saudi Arabia, they are . happy to abide by the strict caveats laid out by their country's . leaders. These include . dressing modestly, being accompanied by a male guardian at all times and . never mixing with men during the Games, Prince Nawaf bin Faisal told . the Al-Jazirah newspaper. Saudi sportswomen may only take part . if they do so 'wearing suitable clothing that complies with sharia' (Islamic law) and 'the athlete's guardian agrees and attends with her', . he said. 'There must also be no mixing with men during the Games,' he added. 'The athlete and her guardian must pledge not to break these conditions,' he said. It comes after months of talks - with Saudi Olympic chiefs at one point insisting no women would be allowed to take part. IOC . president Jacques Rogge described their entry, confirmed by the Saudi . Arabian Olympic Committee ahead of the July 9 deadline, as 'very . positive news'. He said: . 'The IOC has been working very closely with the Saudi Arabian Olympic . Committee and I am pleased to see that our continued dialogue has come . to fruition. 'The IOC has . been striving to ensure a greater gender balance at the Olympic Games, . and todayâ€™s news can be seen as an encouraging evolution. 'With Saudi Arabian female athletes . now joining their fellow female competitors from Qatar and Brunei . Darussalam, it means that by London 2012 every National Olympic . Committee will have sent women to the Olympic Games.' Adherence: In Saudi Arabia when in public women are required to wear a black abaya and head scarf by law . Qatar . and Brunei, two other countries that have never sent any female . athletes to the Olympics, are also including women on their teams for . the London Games. With the Saudis now following suit, . it means all national teams competing in the games will include female . athletes for the first time in Olympic history. About 10,500 athletes are expected to compete in London, representing more than 200 national Olympic committees. Good news: IOC president Jacques Rogge described their entry as 'very positive news' Saudi Arabia has been under pressure . from the International Olympic Committee and human-rights groups to . include women athletes. The IOC has been in negotiations with the Saudis for months on securing the participation of women. They said the two Saudi athletes were entered by the Saudi Arabian Olympic Committee by the official deadline of July 9. Rights groups hailed the decision as a . step forward for Saudi women in their quest for basic rights in a . country that severely restricts them in public life. 'It's . an important precedent that will create space for women to get rights . and it will be hard for Saudi hardliners to roll back,' said Minky . Worden of the New York-based Human Rights Watch. In the Saudi city of Jeddah, Mariam Alawi, a housewife in her 20s, said: 'This is fantastic news and it's about time. Maybe now people in Saudi can see that females are capable of taking the reins. The world already knows that women can do great things - maybe now Saudi can know that too.' Hashim Adnan, a 28-year-old Saudi man who works at an investment firm in Jeddah, said the athletes were likely to face 'heavy criticism' in the country, but that the government should support them. Saudi King Abdullah has a reputation as a cautious reformer and supporter of women's rights. Last year he announced plans to allow women to vote in municipal council elections and join the consultative Shoura council. The country's official sports body, the General Presidency of Youth Welfare, only caters to male athletes and women do not take part in sports at state schools. So women athletes have to fund themselves and arrange their own training, mostly abroad. A Saudi official told Reuters earlier this month Saudi women participating in the Olympics would have to obey the dress code of Islamic law. He did not elaborate, but other conservative Muslim countries have interpreted this to mean a headscarf, long sleeves and long pants. Saudi Arabia is one of three countries, alongside Brunei and Qatar, never to have sent female athletes to the Olympics but the latter two confirmed earlier this year that their delegations would include women. Brunei has entered Maziah Mahusin (athletics), while Qatar has entered Nada Arkaji (swimming), Noor Al-Malki (athletics), Aya Magdy (table tennis) and Bahiya Al-Hamad (shooting), who will also be her country's flagbearer at the opening ceremony.

There is a pressing issue threatening U.S./Russian relations that has forced some of each nation's highest dignitaries - from senators to ambassadors -  to get involved in what could potentially be the biggest clash between the two superpowers since the end of the Cold War. The pressing issue du-jour: Yogurt. The Russian government reportedly has blocked the shipment of thousands of containers of Chobani yogurt to U.S. athletes in Sochi, Russia, who are competing in the Olympic games. The dispute has gotten so overblown that a sitting U.S. senator has written a strongly worded letter to the Russian ambassador to the United States urging him to allow a 'one-time shipment of Greek yogurt and solely for the consumption of U.S. citizens during the 2014 Olympic games.' No-gurt: The Russian government has refused to allow U.S.-made Chobani yogurt into the country for U.S. athletes at the Olympics . Diplomacy: Senator Chuck Schumer wrote a strongly worded letter to Russian officials demanding the yogurt be allowed at the games . 'With the Sochi Olympic Games starting at the end of this week, there is . simply no time to waste in getting our Olympic athletes and employees a . nutritious and delicious breakfast â€“ Chobani Greek Yogurt,' Senator Chuck Schumer - a Democrat from New York - . said in a statement accompanying his letter to the Russian ambassador. Worth noting is the fact that Chobani is headquartered in Upstate New York - and is represented in the U.S. Senate by Schumer. According to the New York Times, there currently is a shipment of 5,000 containers of Chobani yogurt - that was bound for Sochi to be enjoyed by Olympic athletes - sitting in a cold storage unit near Newark Liberty Airport in New Jersey because the Russian government refuses to allow the dairy product within its borders because the U.S. government has not filed the proper paperwork. Constituents: The Chobani company just happens to be headquartered in upstate New York - where its elected representative to the U.S. Senate is Chuck Schumer . According to Schumer, the customs certifications that the Russian government is requiring for the legal shipping of the yogurt is 'unattainable.' In his plea for a lift of this yogurt blockade, Schumer argues that Chobani yogurt has become in integral part of many of the athletes' training regiments leading up to the games, and it would be unfair to deny them a key part of their diets. The Russian government, however, doesn't seem to care. Yevgeniy Khorishko, a spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Washington, said U.S. officials were told about the necessary paperwork, but had failed to comply. 'We are a . lawful country,' he said. 'You should follow the rules.' Training: Schumer argues that many athletes relied on Chobani during their training and should be allowed to have it even if they're in Russia . In his letter, Schumer goes on to further advocate for the yogurt company, writing that, 'as the world looks forward to a successful 2014 Winter Olympics, I urge . your country's immediate approval of the entry of this shipment of . Chobani Greek yogurt.' He then thanked the Russians for their attention to this 'urgent matter.'","The Russians claim the U.S. didn't file the proper paperwork to import Chobani .

"By . Ray Massey . UPDATED: . 04:40 EST, 24 June 2011 . Outgoing Network Rail boss Iain Coucher received a £1.6million 'golden goodbye' when he quit the troubled firm, it emerged yesterday. Details of his lavish payoff were revealed in the company's annual report, fuelling fresh outrage over public-sector fat cats. Mr Coucher, 49, quit the rail-infrastructure firm last October after three years as chief executive, citing 'personal reasons'. £1million payoff: Former Network Rail CEO Iain Coucher, pictured in 2008 . He received a compensation package of £1,075,000, salary of £359,000, pension of £214,000 and benefits of £9,000, according to Network Rail's annual report. Transport Secretary Philip Hammond said the package typified the profligacy allowed to flourish at the expense of the public purse under the last Labour government. 'This payoff will stick in the gullet of every farepayer and taxpayer who think they pay too much to use our railway,' added Mr Hammond. The package was also condemned by Gerry Doherty, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA), who said Mr Coucher had been 'rewarded for failure' on a grand scale. Rail passengers were paying the highest fares in Europe, on the most overcrowded network, while Mr Coucher had 'transformed' himself into a multi-millionaire. 'Passengers will be furious that he has walked away with over £1million of taxpayers' money after years of failure,' said Mr Doherty. Plush: Iain Coucher's Aston Martin outside his home in the Midlands . James Bond style: Mr Coucher enjoyed a luxury lifestyle with an Aston Martin funded by a car allowance . Last year Network Rail received £3.7billion in subsidies from the taxpayer as part of a £30billion total for the years from 2009-14. Mr Coucher had previously been deputy chief executive of Network Rail, but his three years in charge were dogged by allegations of excessive pay and questions over his ‘arrogant’ management style. During eight years at the company, he received more than £7million in pay and bonuses. He enjoyed a luxury lifestyle with an Aston Martin funded by a car allowance. He also received a £20,000 housing allowance for a flat overlooking Regent's Park in London, and, in addition to a house in the Midlands, owned a £1million Highlands estate, which he named 'Iainland'. An unrepentant Mr Coucher defended his record last night, insisting that while he understood the 'strong sentiments' surrounding executive remuneration, he was proud of his role in the 'transformation of Britain’s railways'. He had not been required to work his full notice period and 'this triggered a payment in line with my contract'. But Mr Hammond said: 'Most people will feel it doesn’t sit well given the difficult times most families are facing. 'I will be seeking assurances that this is the last chapter in the sorry saga of the old Network Rail as set up by Gordon Brown.' The railways should 'clamp down on unsustainable practices dependent on public subsidy'. While Network Rail has insisted it will not pay annual bonuses to executives this year, four current directors received more than £280,000 in 'long-term incentive' rewards between them in the last financial year. Individual payments ranged from £61,725 to £90,723. Rare agreement: Philip Hammond, the .

Scroll Down for Video: . No need to worry: Fans of the Hunger Games worried that because Philip Seymour Hoffman (pictured with Woody Harrelson) had died - his scenes in the hit movie would have been left incomplete . The Hollywood Reporter has claimed that Lionsgate are now going to use CGI effects to create a likeness of Hoffman that will not necessarily be viewed face-on to camera. 'These days the technology of using someoneâ€™s likeness is a whole lot easier to do,' Rob Legato, an effects supervisor on major films including The Wolf of Wall Street, told The Hollywood Reporter. 'I wonâ€™t say you could generate a Philip Seymour Hoffman with all the acting ability, but you could certainly replicate him for a shot or two.'

"By . Reuters . and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:45 EST, 6 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 02:18 EST, 6 February 2014 . The latest in a series of winter storms hit the United States on Wednesday, dropping wet, heavy snow in the Northeast states that disrupted travel and threatened supplies of salt needed to keep roads clear. Over a million homes and businesses were without power in the Northeast on Wednesday following severe snow and ice storms overnight, according to local power companies. The hardest-hit state was Pennsylvania with 849,000 customers without electricity at one point, according to the governor. By 8 p.m. local time, that was reduced to just over 625,000 customers, said Cory Angell, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency. Most of those were in Philadelphia and surrounding counties. Crushed: Falling trees in Pennsylvania did more than just knock out power lines during Wednesday's brutal storm . Outages: Pennsylvania appears to have suffered the worst of the storm, with nearly 900,000 people without power at one point . Destruction: Several homes were damaged by falling trees that were weighed down by ice that had accumulated . Delays: New York-area airports were hit particularly hard, with nearly half of the departing flights from the city's three airports getting canceled . Researchers say that bad weather can actually make us work harder - and improve our focus . Relief: After two brutal storms, it appears the Northeast can expect some relief on Thursday . Chores: Snowstorms often create additional chores for children in the Northeast . Throughout the United States, 2,893 flights were canceled on Wednesday, according to FlightAware.com, an online flight tracking site. The weather hit airports in the Northeast particularly hard, with roughly half the departing flights canceled out of Newark Liberty International, LaGuardia Airport and Boston's Logan International, FlightAware said. The governors of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania declared states of emergency. The governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut told some state employees not to report to work due to the treacherous weather. Officials in New York and New Jersey warned they were starting to run short of the rock salt used by road crews to keep ice from building up on highways and local roads, the result of the season's repeated storms. 'We have a salt shortage for some parts of the state, primarily New York City and the Long Island area, because there have been so many storms this season already,' New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters on a conference call. 'The state does have a significant amount of salt on hand. We'll be shipping that salt around the state.' Salt: New York experienced a slat shortage, which made it hard for officials to keep ice off the roads and bridges . Covered: Officials say New York roadways were covered by four inches of snow and a quarter-inch of ice . Salt: Like New York, New Jersey suffered a similar salt shortage, which led to slick roadways and school closures and delays . Piles: The enormous amounts of snow dumped on the Northeast is making for some gigantic snow piles . Pretty: Ice on trees may look pretty, but it weighs down the branches and is a big cause of power outages . Neighboring New Jersey reported a similar salt shortage. 'We've had so many storms, one after another, that it definitely has put a very significant demand on salt,' said Joe Dee, a spokesman for the state Department of Transportation. 'Our supplies are dwindling,' Dee added. 'We have plenty for this storm. We're looking at some weekend storms and we have enough for that, but we're going to start to get low. We need some good weather and a chance to replenish our supplies.' As of January 26, New Jersey spent $60 million on snow removal, putting it on pace to break the record of $62.5 million spent last year, Dee said. New York City has spread some 346,000 tons of rock salt on its roads so far this year, almost the total for last winter, said Belinda Mager, a spokeswoman for the city Department of Sanitation. The city has spent $57.3 million on snow removal so far this winter, putting it on track to top last year's spending. Pricey: As of January 26, New Jersey spent $60 million on snow removal, putting it on pace to beat the $62.5 million spent last year . Crash: More than 300 traffic accidents were reported on major roadways and side streets throughout Connecticut . Cleanup: Cleaning up the mess left by the storm is going to take a lot of time, and officials fear another storm could push cities over the edge financially . Dangerous: Icy and snowy road conditions caused hundreds of traffic accidents in the Northeast . In Indiana, there was so much snow that the city of Columbus resorted to using front-end loaders to move the snow . Most U.S. states and major cities do not try to set an upper limit on spending for snow removal but authorize agencies to spend what is necessary and count on legislatures to cover the cost. 'Before I became governor, I never saw winter in budgetary terms, but now I do,' Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick told local WBZ radio, adding that he was counting on lawmakers to fund the state's rising snow-removal and salt tab. Some commercial suppliers have run out of rock salt. 'We're just continuing to get crushed by these storms. With major rock salt shortages, it's starting to get scary out there,' said Anthony Scorzetti, a hardware and paint manager for Braen Supply in Wanaque, New Jersey. 'I have people calling from all parts of the East Coast looking for it, and we just have nothing.' Bruce Small, 58, an aircraft mechanic from Milford, Connecticut, called the local road conditions 'horrible.' Not all bad: People clear tables in New Hampshire for Newport's annual Winter Carnival and Yankee Luau . Snow: With many kids home from school, they might as well make the best of a cold situation . Removal: Power companies are forced to cut trees in order to free wires that were brought down in the storm . Snow Day: Hundreds of schools were either closed or experienced delays - and none of the students seemed to mind . Not all bad: Winter storms can be devastating - but they make for some excellent sledding . 'Everyone was skidding all over the place,' he said, calling the wet, heavy snow storm 'miserable, brutal.' More than 300 traffic accidents were reported on major roadways and side streets throughout the state, with one that was serious but with no fatalities, according to Connecticut State Police. Tom Breier, general manager of Ice Melt Chicago, a supplier based in Lisle, Illinois, said he got a call from a New York supplier pleading for salt but could not help. 'Everybody's in the same boat. There aren't a lot of options,' he said. The weather is causing shipping problems, he said. A lot of the salt in the Chicago area comes from Louisiana and Texas on the Mississippi and the Illinois rivers on barges, but the Illinois River is frozen. The salt is arriving by truck, he said, which increases freight costs. Chilly weather broke a record for February 5 in Denver, Colorado, where the high temperature on Wednesday stayed below zero, at minus 1 Fahrenheit (minus 18 Celsius). 'This is likely the coldest air mass we'll see in Colorado for 2014,' said Kyle Ferdin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boulder, Colorado. The overnight low in Denver was forecast to hit minus 11F (minus 24C), he said.","Pennsylvania was hardest hit, with 625,000 customers still without power .

This artist reconstruction shows it had scissor-like claws . A lobster-like beast that lived 500 million years ago has been named after Hollywood actor Johnny Depp because of its 'scissor hand' claws. The extinct creature called Kooteninchela deppi (pronounced Koo-ten-ee-che-la depp-eye) was named after Depp by scientists from Imperial College London who made the discovery. Kooteninchela deppi is helping researchers piece together more information about life on Earth during the Cambrian period, which happened more than 1.9million years ago and was when nearly all modern animal types emerged. Lead researcher David Legg said: 'When I first saw the pair . of isolated claws in the fossil records of this species I could not help . but think of Edward Scissorhands. 'Even the genus name, Kooteninchela, includes the reference to this film as 'chela' is Latin for claws or scissors. 'I am also a Depp . fan and what better way to honour the man than to immortalise him as . an ancient creature that once roamed the sea?' In the 1990 film Edward Scissorhands, Johnny Depp (right) starred opposite Dianne West (left) and played an artificial man who had scissors for hands. His inventor, played in the film by Vincent Price, died before giving Edward human hands. These blades were the inspiration for David Legg when he was naming the recently discovered fossils of a lobster-like creature that lived 500 million years ago . The sea scavenger, Kooteninchela deppi is a distant relative of lobsters and scorpions. It lived in shallow seas off the cost of British Columbia in Canada.

President Vladimir Putin today tightened his control over Russia's media by dissolving the main state news agency and replacing it with an organisation that is to promote Moscow's image abroad. With the stroke of a pen, Putin abolished RIA Novosti and created a news agency to be known as Rossiya Segodnya, or Russia Today. It is the second in two weeks strengthening Putin's hold on the media as he tries to reassert his authority after protests against his rule. Most Russian media outlets are already loyal to Putin, and opponents get little air time, but the shake-up underlined their importance to Putin keeping power and the Kremlin's concern about the president's ratings and image. Conservative news anchor, Dmitry Kiselyov has been appointed as the new organisation's chief. The controversial journalist - described as a 'powerful propagandist' - provoked outraged after once saying the organs of homosexuals should not be used in transplants. 'The main focus of... Rossiya Segodnya (Russia Today) is to highlight abroad the state policy and public life of the Russian Federation,' said a decree signed by Putin. Sergei Ivanov, the head of the presidential administration, told reporters that the changes were intended to save money and improve the state media. But the new organisation has strong similarities to APN, a Soviet-era news agency whose role included writing articles about 'the social-economic and cultural life of the Soviet people and items reflecting Soviet society's point of view on important internal and international events'. RIA said in an English-language article about Putin's step: 'The move is the latest in a series of shifts in Russia's news landscape which appear to point towards a tightening of state control in the already heavily regulated media sector.' Defiance: Putin's regime has faced growing popular resistance, such as this authorized opposition protest against the alleging mass fraud in parliamentary polls in central St.Petersburg in 2011 . Crackdown: Russian police detain a protester demonstrating against the 2012 election of Putin which was mired in accusations of widespread fraud . Rossiya Segodnya's focus on building up Russia abroad could solidify Putin's grip on information by further limiting sources of news for Russians whose TV screens are dominated by state-controlled channels. Putin's decree appeared to have little effect on the two other major Russian news agencies, state-run Itar-Tass and private Interfax, but it could benefit both by making RIA's replacement less of a competitor domestically. Itar-Tass is the successor of the Soviet official Tass agency, while Interfax has more leeway as a private agency but is restricted by the Kremlin's dominance. Loyal: President Putin named Dmitry Kiselyov, pictured, as the head of Russia Today . The new head of Rossiya Segodnya has been described as a 'powerful propagandist' by a prominent member of parliament, Alexei Mitrofanov. But said this was a good thing and that he was suitable for the job. In his third term, after weathering protests led by urban liberals, the 61-year-old Putin has often appealed to conservatives and championed the Russian Orthodox Church as a moral guide for society. Kiselyov has proved a loyal Putin supporter as a television presenter, at times making provocative remarks. In 2010 he said homosexuals should be banned from donating blood or sperm and last year said they should also be banned from donating organs. Putin has been Russia's dominant leader since he was first elected president in 2000. He began his third term in the Kremlin in May 2012 after stepping aside to serve for four years as prime minister because of constitutional limits. The opposition staged big street protests against him for several months from December 2011, following a parliamentary election they said was rigged. The demonstrations have faded but Putin's popularity ratings have declined from their peak during his first two terms - from 2000 until 2008. The Kremlin extended its grip over radio and television broadcasting on Nov. 26 when the media arm of state-controlled Gazprom bought mining tycoon Vladimir Potanin's Profmedia. Through the deal, the ex-Soviet gas ministry - now Russia's largest firm by revenue - will add TV and radio stations, cinemas and film production and distribution assets to a sprawling portfolio built up around commercial channel NTV. The Kremlin already funds an English-language TV channel called RT which was initially known as Russia Today. It is not clear whether the two will operate separately and RT's head, Margarita Simonyan, said she had been unaware of the move. The new organisation will be created in RIA Novosti's headquarters in central Moscow. The fate of its journalists and other employees was not immediately clear. RIA Novosti was created as the Soviet Information Bureau in 1941, after Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union, and issues reports in Russian and foreign languages.","New agency's mission is to project Russia's image abroad .

'I want you to know that you didn't have to be big and tall or even loud for us to notice you,' Josh said in the video. 'You didn't have to stand in front of a pulpit or write a book to capture our attention. You just did. 'In fact, you did more in your 10 days on earth than I could ever hope to. This is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. But I want you to know that I'm so proud of you.' The family thanked Zion for everything he taught them in his short life - and how he brought them closer to God. 'He makes heaven a little closer to my heart,' they said.

Low-cost airline GoAir is to only hire female flight attendants to save money on its fuel bill . GoAir plans to add 80 aircraft to its 15-strong fleet by 2020, reports the Times of India, and will recruit 2,000 cabin crew and pilots. It will also cut the size of its in-flight magazine and only fill its water tanks to 60 per cent capacity to try to make its planes lighter. The company estimates that every extra pound in weight costs it one-and-a-half rupees (1.7p) per flying hour. Chief executive Giorgo De Roni blamed the Indian rupee, which has dropped 27 per cent against the US dollar in the last year, for the need to cut costs. 'The rupee's fall has hurt the industry badly,' he told the newspaper.

Scores of tourists travel to Egypt’s Red Sea to snorkel under the sun, but one underwater photographer has captured strange sea creatures of the night that come into their own after under the cover of darkness. Many of the sea’s most efficient predators spend their days lazily drifting along waiting for darkness - and their chance to hunt. Moray eels and porcupine fish that have been docile during the day suddenly spring into life. Wide awake: As the sun goes down on the red Sea, a porcupine fish (pictured) that has been docile during the day suddenly springs into life while small shoals of fish dart for cover . Underwater photographer Andrey Nekrasov captured these images in the Red Sea off the coast of Egypt. 'Night-time in the sea is not scary. It's very quiet, peaceful and mysterious,’ he said. 'I could only hear the sound of my bubbles of exhaled air and could see only what my flashlight shined on.' Here a diver looks at a Spanish dancer, a type of sea creature who was so named because of its whirling swimming movement and red colour which are reminiscent of the skirt movements of a flamenco dancer . Synanceia verrucosa (left) is a reef stonefish. It is a carnivorous ray-finned fish with venomous spines that lives on reef bottoms camouflaged as a rock. As its mean looks might suggest, it is the most venomous known fish in the world and can be lethal to humans. In contrast, Basket star (pictured right) are a group of brittle stars related to starfish. They generally live in deep sea habitats and in the wild can live up to 35 years . The Red Sea is a diverse ecosystem with more than 1,200 species of fish, 10 per cent of which are found nowhere else in the world. The coastal reefs are particularly rich and attract thousands of tourists eager to go snorkelling and scuba diving every year. Mr Nekrasov, from the Ukraine, said: ‘If you get into the water just before the sunset, you'll probably catch the sight of some marine inhabitants preparing to rest overnight while others are getting ready for hunting. The tassled scorpionfish (pictured) is a carnivorous ray-finned fish. When in shallow waters, swimmers may accidentally tread on them which may cause painful injury from their venomous spines . The yellow boxfish (pictured) is bright yellow in colour but as it ages, the brightness fades and very old specimens will have blue-grey coloration with faded yellow. It feeds mainly on algae, but will also feed on sponges, crustaceans and molluscs . The giant moray eel (pictured) can reach up to three metres (almost 10ft) in length and weigh up to 30kg (66lbs). They sometimes hunt with coralgroupers so that they can enter narrow crevices and flush prey from niches not accessible to the groupers, in the only known instance of interspecies cooperative hunting among fish . 'In the twilight, reef-dwellers seem to come out in larger numbers. Big morays, which were hiding from the daylight in their cave residences, are swimming along the reef wall moving from one cover to another or between coral blocks and nearby. 'Eventually the evening shadows deepen so that you can't make out anything without a torch and real night comes. 'This is the time for reef invertebrates. They are often hunted during the day by fish who are adapted for searching and rooting out these invertebrates from their shelters.’ The red lionfish (pictured) is a venomous coral reef fish that can grow up to 47cm in length and typically lives for 10 years. The fish has large poisonous spines that protrude from its body like a mane, giving it its common name of the lionfish . The Chinese trumpetfish (pictured) can grow up to 80cm in length and has a long, tubular snout and mouth that it can thrust forward to catch prey. It is a stealthy hunter that eats smaller fish and crustaceans and is a mostly solitary creature . Here another diver comes face to face with a masked puffer fish (pictured). The fish has what looks like a black mask over its eyes and a very unusual mating pattern. It will visit a grotto and leave thick sperm behind to produce a scent to deter predators . He explained that during the night while their predators are sleeping, they have the opportunity to stretch their fins and go for a swim as well as forage for food. 'Their diet usually consists of organic waste accumulated during the day. And as a result of their work overnight the reef becomes much cleaner when the morning comes,' he added. The giant freshwater puffer (pictured) is carnivorous and originates from the Congo in Africa. It can grow up to 26cm (26inches) long and can inflate itself with water or air when stressed and frightened. It feeds on smaller fish and crustaceans - but if kept in captivity needs to eat crunchy food so that its teeth don't get too long . The sea goldie (pictured) is a hermaphrodite. A male retains a harem of 5 to 10 females, but when he dies one of the females will undergo sex reversal and take the place of the missing male. Reproduction occurs at sunset, between December and February in the Red Sea . The anemone hermit crab l(pictured) ooks scary and lives up to depths of 27metres, but it collects small sea anemones to place on its shell for self defence .","Underwater photographer Andrey Nekraso, from the Ukraine, photographed efficient predators at night .

I wonder if you could do a drawing for me of an explosive slab of chocolate. 'We have received information that the enemy are using pound slabs of chocolate which are made of steel with a very thin covering of real chocolate. 'Inside there is high explosive and some form of delay mechanism... When you break off a piece of chocolate at one end in the normal way, instead of it falling away, a piece of canvas is revealed stuck into the middle of the piece which has been broken off and a ticking into the middle of the remainder of the slab. 'When the piece of chocolate is pulled sharply, the canvas is also pulled and this initiates the mechanism. 'I enclose a very poor sketch done by somebody who has seen one of these. 'It is wrapped in the usual sort of black paper with gold lettering, the variety being PETERS. 'Would it be possible for you to do a drawing of this, one possibly with the paper half taken off revealing one end and another with the piece broken off showing the canvas. 'The text should indicate that this piece together with the attached canvas is pulled out sharply and that after a delay of seven seconds the bomb goes off.'

Worrying: The expenses watchdog established to clean up Parliament was plunged into turmoil last night after four of its five board members quit following a power struggle with the Commons Speaker John Bercow, pictured . The expenses watchdog established to clean up Parliament was plunged into turmoil last night after four of its five board members quit following a power struggle with the Commons Speaker John Bercow. In a dramatic move, four of the founding board members of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority announced they were stepping down because of concerns about interference by Mr Bercow. Former High Court judge Sir Scott Baker, former Liberal Democrat leadership contender Jackie Ballard, top businessman Ken Olisa and Professor Isobel Sharp, former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, announced they were stepping down when their contracts expire in January. They are said to have been deeply unhappy about Mr Bercow’s demand that they re-apply for their jobs in a process partly overseen by a former MP who repeatedly voted to block publication of MPs’ expenses. The process to replace them is expected to cost taxpayers £100,000. In a provocative move, Mr Bercow has appointed the former Conservative MP for Hexham Peter Atkinson to sit on the panel which will appoint Ipsa’s board. Mr Atkinson, who stepped down at the last election, was one of a group of MPs who tried to block the publication of expenses claims that uncovered the scandal which heaped shame on Parliament three years ago. He also called for MPs to be given a £20,000 pay rise instead of expenses, and had to repay £100 claimed for a garden shed at his second home in fashionable Richmond in South-West London –  along with £21.86 claimed for tools to put it up. In a letter to Mr Bercow, Ipsa’s chairman Sir Ian Kennedy, the only remaining member of the board, warned that appointing an MP would be ‘wholly undesirable  given the need for Ipsa to be and to be seen to be independent of political influence’. Had enough: Former High Court judge Sir Scott Baker, left, and former Liberal Democrat leadership contender Jackie Ballard, right,  announced they were stepping down when their contracts expire in January .
